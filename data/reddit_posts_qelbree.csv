Tapering off qelbree. Advice? ,"I cross-tapered in the opposite direction. Tapered down off Strattera while tapering up onto Qelbree. That's when I learned about the debilitating migraine.  It only lasted a full day, but the brutality of it kept me fully out of action. Now, the thought of ever coming off or going on a lengthy trip and coming up short is terrifying. I guess ""that's how they get you."" üòû"
Tapering off qelbree. Advice? ,and the coupon doesnt work well? it cut the cost in half when mine didnt cover it (which is still stupid expensive)  as for taper i dont know because i too ended up in the ER and immediately went back on them.
Tapering off qelbree. Advice? ,"My doc put me on super low dose strattera to help taper off qelbree. It worked perfectly. 

I was on 200mg qelbree and started taking that every other day and 18mg strattera the other days. Then after a couple weeks I stretched it to two strattera then 1 qelbree. And when that was ok I went 3 days then forgot I had 1 qelbree left and took it last night. Basically tapered over a full month plus a bit. No problems at all. 

My ins never covered it and they majorly changed the coupon so it‚Äôs useless for people without insurance now unless they have $200/month laying around."
Tapering off qelbree. Advice? ,"I tapered off of 100s over a month by opening the capsules and doing my best to divide the little dots into half and quarters.  I had a low grade migraine 2 days after taking my last dose of the quarter amount.  It only lasted about a half day.
Before tapering off though, I found that taking a Nurtec (a prescribed migraine medication) really helped."
Tapering off qelbree. Advice? ,I missed two doses because of the pharmacy not getting it in time and I ended up in urgent care desperate for relief from the horrible migraine. It was terrible.
Qelbree and caffeine?,"Qelbree interferes with your body‚Äôs processes that break down caffeine. Therefore whatever effects it has on you will last much, much longer. Keep this well in mind."
Qelbree and caffeine?,"It will amp up some people‚Äôs heart rate, blood pressure and anxiety level."
Qelbree and caffeine?,"Before starting any meds, I normally consumed half a pot of richly brewed coffee a day with no ill consequences. 

When I first started on Qelbree, I was having manic episodes (absolutely not normal for me) and severe insomnia for the first two weeks.  After reading about the caffeine interaction, I cut out coffee entirely and those side effects went away and I was able to sleep through the night again. 

Remarkably I had no withdrawal issues from cold turkey-ing caffeine either. 

I'll have a small cup of coffee on the weekend now, 3 months later, because I love it so much, but I can tell I shouldn't drink more as my heartbeat gets irregular. 

From what I've read your ability to process caffeine and melatonin slows down to about 25% of normal depending on the individual."
Qelbree and caffeine?,"It slows down your bodies ability to process caffeine. Significantly. So a coffee in the afternoon and you‚Äôre basically fucked for sleep lol. I used it as a chance to significantly reduce my coffee intake and will work to probably do decaf or none in the foreseeable future. I used to have 2 coffees a day and now I have 1 but I also don‚Äôt feel the need for the coffee as I can control my focus much better on this med. I drink way less alcohol too, again less desire, but I feel like super shit drinking alcohol on this. 

I do still enjoy marijuana edibles a few times a week with no noticeable issue."
Qelbree and caffeine?,"I drink 1-3 cups of green tea per day, I brew it really light and space them out. Haven't noticed any negative effects and it seems to help focus me a little more, though I think it's a bit of the ritual of making tea and then settling down to study or start cleaning that gives me a boost when I make a cup. I would avoid large doses of caffeine at all costs, I drank an espresso like 1 month in and thought I was going to have a panic attack, I'd been a barista for years at that point and had NEVER had a caffeine reaction like that before."
Qelbree and caffeine?,"Drinking coffee or other things with caffeine seems to cause nausea and headaches sometimes with me. Not sure about the other interactions they are talking about. The nausea and headaches are bad enough that I have been skipping caffeine‚Ä¶ And I love coffee‚Ä¶ It was really hard, but I really wanted to see results and the only other thing I could do would just be to stop Qelbree."
Qelbree and caffeine?,"I‚Äôve been drinking it and feel fine. I have noticed that I don‚Äôt have the desire to drink multiple cups like I used to, now one a day will work for me and I actually much prefer that."
Qelbree and caffeine?,My doctor told me it would make caffeine less efficient and avoided it initially. Then I needed some and it doesn‚Äôt seem to have any interaction at this point. I did wait until after the first few weeks and side effects had mostly gone away before trying.
Qelbree and caffeine?,On 200mg caffeine made me sleepy asf
Qelbree and caffeine?,"I also heavily relied on caffeine before Qelbree! Somehow, it started causing caffeine to make me sleepy- so I had to just cut it out. Strangely, I had no caffeine withdrawal symptoms. I still drink at least one diet dr. pepper everyday because it doesn‚Äôt have very much caffeine, and i think the smaller dose gives me a little energy"
Qelbree and caffeine?,"When I tried strattera for 30 days, I had to cut caffeine significantly because it was affecting my sleep so bad. With Qelbree, I hadn't noticed the same effects with caffeine so I continued to drink my morning coffee as usual. But now after being on 400mg for 3-4 weeks, I am struggling to even finish my coffee and today I didn't even have the desire to drink one at all. Which I guess isn't a bad thing, it'll save me money lol but I also loved the routine and ritual of my morning cold brew."
Qelbree and caffeine?,"I'm a daily cannabis smoker, I've seen no problems with that. Only caffeine. And on day 4 of Qelbree I had a single can of 8% hard cider and got WAY buzzed off of it and then had a horrible emotional plummet and had an entire meltdown that i couldn't control. Just so much sobbing out of nowhere. I had called a pharmacist and was told it wasn't dangerous to drink lightly, and being that it was my anniversary, I thought having one hard cider would be fine. Wrong ü´†"
Qelbree and caffeine?,Same here.  So very bazaro.
Qelbree and caffeine?,I did 12 days on Strattera and HATED it. I was so sick on it.
Qelbree and caffeine?,"It was a nightmare! I kept trying to push through thinking the side effects would subside and nope, not even a little bit."
Is anyone having a good experience?,"I've been on Qelbree almost a year and have had a great experience on it (with an exception of when insurance companies were switched and the new one refused to pay for it so I ran out and had those wicked headaches/migraines). 

I'm at 400 mg instead of 600 because I didn't notice a difference between the two improvement-wise. 

As for the reviews, more people are most likely to complain about their bad experiences than praise their good ones. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I had Vyvanse before Qelbree and had a psychotic break on it. I still don't remember those three days or how I managed to drive or care for my kids. I felt like a zombie for a week after I got out of those three days. But I know a ton of people who take Vyvanse and love it. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
Is anyone having a good experience?,I‚Äôve been on it for almost little over two weeks. I‚Äôm on 400 mg. At first it put me to sleep but now I‚Äôm able to function normally. I only got a headache one time when I was very late taking the dosage. I like Qelbree. No complaints here
Is anyone having a good experience?,Hey! That sounds like a pretty quick ramp up for dosage and might be why you‚Äôre experiencing the headaches. I‚Äôve been on 200mg for a month after straterra didn‚Äôt work for me and it‚Äôs been a really subtle but helpful change in my symptom management. I feel like I have better task initiation and can control racing thoughts more. I‚Äôm not as irritable and it‚Äôs helped with anxiety. It did take almost three weeks for the insomnia to die down which was the worst side effect for me.
Is anyone having a good experience?,That ramp up sounds extreme‚Ä¶. My son has been on it for almost a year and it‚Äôs been great. Not as focused as with a stimulant though
Is anyone having a good experience?,Had a great experience for over a year but it was months until I started upping my dose
Is anyone having a good experience?,"No. Lasted 3 weeks. Can't function on 1 hour of sleep a day. Also didn't like the sex function side effect. Nothing appeared to ramp down once I did 2 weeks on 400mg.

Adderall seemed great. No side effects at all. Can't get it in my area, so I tried this crap. No more playing around with pills for me."
Is anyone having a good experience?,"I‚Äôve been on it about 1yr 9mos, 400mg. At first I had issues with diastolic BP, some afternoon fatigue and nighttime insomnia but those are good now. Only issue I have is if I miss a dose I get a migraine. In fact I almost missed today so took it couple hours ago. 

I took Cuban‚Äôs when it first came out and don‚Äôt remember having any issues except for cost so I switched to adderral. Once I started working from home and eventually moving/ changing Dr, this is what my new one recommended after retesting."
Is anyone having a good experience?,"I made sure to share my somewhat positive post yesterday in this subreddit. I've only been on it for a few days at 200mg but I'm noticing some positive effects. Context, I also haven't tried true stimulants before, so having any actual ADHD treatment feels wonderful. 

Upping 200mg every 5 days feels like an extremely quick timeline, and from my understanding 600mg is the max dosage. Drugs.com says ""Dosage may be titrated in increments of 200 mg weekly to the maximum recommended dosage of 600 mg once daily, **depending on response and tolerability.**"". I know I sure wouldn't be able to say how I'm feeling until the side effects go away and I feel stable for a week. 

One thing to note is that qelbree is considered a non-stimulant because it is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, and doesn't manipulate dopamine like stimulants might. It should be treated more like an antidepressant than a stimulant, and you will get some nasty side effects if you suddenly change dosage or stop taking it. That's probably why your doctor said it needs to ""build up in your system"", although the half life is only 7 hours. 

Personally I'm upset your doctor didn't seem to do their research or inform you better... But that also seems to be the theme since it is a newer drug."
Is anyone having a good experience?,Thank you for sharing. I realize the inherent bias of posting online (aka yelp) ‚Äî just trying to get all sides.
Is anyone having a good experience?,Glad to hear amidst a lot of negative experiences. Cheers!
Is anyone having a good experience?,helps with executive function?? like task initiation
Is anyone having a good experience?,Hoping it helps with anxiety as well. Part of the reason I was told to try something other than an amphetamine based medication. Seems like my dosage is a bit higher than I realized though
Is anyone having a good experience?,Thank you for the response and the info. Going to bring it up with my Psychiatrist
Is anyone having a good experience?,"Yes, ADHD and some anxiety after a bit more time supposedly"
Qelbree destroyed a month of my life,"Here with you pal. 
There‚Äôs a reason the sticky post on this subreddit is a giant warning to NOT GO COLD TURKEY"
Qelbree destroyed a month of my life,Please please please give this feedback your doctor if you haven‚Äôt. The med community needs to take the withdrawal from this drug VERY seriously.
Qelbree destroyed a month of my life,"I'm sorry YOU had a bad experience with it. It doesn't necessarily mean everyone will have the same experience. I started mine 3 weeks ago. My psych prescribed it to me after stimulants and antidepressants weren't working. 

I take 200mg at night. I sleep very well. It's helped with the ADHD but not the depression. I see my doc tomorrow to adjust meds/dose. 

You really need a psychiatrist to help you with dosing. A primary care doc and pharmacist aren't educated enough to know what works for you. 


As for dissing the meds, your DNA may not react well to it but don't discourage others from trying."
Qelbree destroyed a month of my life,"I weaned off over the course of a few months. I would literally count the beads in each pill to slowly taper off. The only time I had symptoms is when I decreased the amount of beads by too much. Quitting cold turkey on most meds is dangerous, and doing so on Qelbree is a nightmare. Near the end of my tapering I would take out 10 more beads than I did the day before. I kept track on a notepad and was very precise about it. It took a long time and I hated counting those damn beads but I don‚Äôt regret doing it that way at all."
Qelbree destroyed a month of my life,"I was lucky, I was only on it for a month, but when I quit cold turkey, I only had a mild headache for 3-4 days. But even with the headache I was feeling more productive and less moody as the med went out of my system. Im not sure of the mechanics, but Qelbree definitely made my executive functioning, focus, and mood worse."
Qelbree destroyed a month of my life,What was the dose you were on? What adhd med did you come from to this?
Qelbree destroyed a month of my life,I have bp2 and add. I tried qelbree. It made me super depressed but kept me awake. For two days after I went off it I had a severe migraine.
Qelbree destroyed a month of my life,I just started and only have some fatigue and insomnia. Which seems to be a side effect in all nonstimulants I have tried. So far this one I have far less side effects than Straterra so hoping it works in 4-8 weeks. Side effects seem to decrease for me after 12-16 weeks.
Qelbree destroyed a month of my life,"I've been on Qelbree for almost a year and overall haven't had any bad experiences with it. 

I actually sleep better with it and have to take it at night due to drowsiness after taking it in the morning. 

I had dry mouth for a few months in the mornings after taking it but not anymore. 

Worst part by far was when work changed insurance companies and the new one refused to cover it. The migraine/headache from that was fucking brutal. 10000% do not recommend. 

But my doctor had ordered a Genesite test and for the ADHD section, I have literally no meds in the stimulant green category for me (that's the 'no problems' category and honestly would explain why I had a psychotic break on Vyvanse lol). 

The non-stim section had only one in green and that was Qelbree. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

Either the Genesite test has something to it or I just got really lucky."
Qelbree destroyed a month of my life,"Qelbree was awful for me too. I cannot recommend it LESS. And I‚Äôm a firm believer that even if I have a negative experience with a medication, it‚Äôs worth it for other people to try it. Qelbree is my one exception. I‚Äôm sorry you went through this too. 

I also had an insane migraine from discontinuation syndrome after being on the lowest dose for only 2 weeks. If it‚Äôs any consolation, the migraine only lasted a day or two for me, though it was still torture. I feel for you."
Qelbree destroyed a month of my life,"I took it for one day and it effected me for like the rest of the week. Anger, irritability, extreme tiredness, all of that. I quit taking it after one dose and told my doctor that it was not a good fit"
Qelbree destroyed a month of my life,I‚Äôm pretty sure qelbree is having the effect of not letting the brain go into deep sleep. I was having the same problem but I haven‚Äôt done a sleep study so idk
Qelbree destroyed a month of my life,I‚Äôm on 400mg and it‚Äôs life changing good for me. Sorry to hear your experience was bad
Qelbree destroyed a month of my life,"I figured it was fine, since I hadn‚Äôt been on it that long!

I really miss CrazyMeds (which dates me, I know). Back in the day, the author would have written up a chatty essay with all the side effects and a huge message about going cold turkey even after a little bit of time."
Qelbree destroyed a month of my life,You can even directly tell the FDA about your experiences. I also told my pharmacist.
Qelbree destroyed a month of my life,Yeah I‚Äôve never had any of these issues. It‚Äôs like these people are taking a completely different drug from me but we all react differently to different medications.
Qelbree destroyed a month of my life,I don't know why you feel the need to post this. Devaluing someone elses experience because it's different than yours isn't going to change anything.  This specific drug has a ton of bad side effects and withdrawl.
Qelbree destroyed a month of my life,"My doctor is actually my psychiatrist. Is that more precise for you?

Neurochemistry is unlikely to be based on just DNA, or else it would be far easier to predict reactions. It‚Äôs likely it‚Äôs not good for bipolar individuals, like SSRIs, for example.

My discouraging people to use Qelbree isn‚Äôt based on the side effects of the drug but based upon the side effects of withdrawal, which make it impossible to discontinue it immediately once it becomes clear that it‚Äôs an issue.

I‚Äôm glad you had a good experience, but a short term four star review doesn‚Äôt negate my zero star review."
Qelbree destroyed a month of my life,"If Qelbree hadn‚Äôt given me mania, I might have done that. But it did, so that wasn‚Äôt an option.

My psychiatrist proscribed me a beta-blocker, and so far that‚Äôs preventing a migraine. Hopefully it continues to work."
Qelbree destroyed a month of my life,"Yeah, it‚Äôs not good for BD, I think.

I‚Äôm dreading Thanksgiving. I was so looking forward to it, and now there‚Äôs a good chance I will spend it in bed away from family with a splitting headache."
Qelbree destroyed a month of my life,"200 mg. I went off Adderall during the recent shortage and couldn‚Äôt reaccomodate myself to it, so we decided to go with this.

Guess I‚Äôm going to titrate my dose of Adderall‚Ä¶."
Qelbree destroyed a month of my life,"I figured I would power through it, but in retrospect I shouldn‚Äôt have. It‚Äôs amazing how much more I got done today - it turns out that being fully awake beats whatever effect Qelbree has on ADHD."
Qelbree destroyed a month of my life,Huh. That would definitely explain why it would create mood issues.
Qelbree destroyed a month of my life,"I have the same feeling, although I also recognize self reported symptom aren't often conducive to good science. I'd love to see someone do a sleep study!"
Qelbree destroyed a month of my life,Me too.  I was only on it for 6 days at the lowest dose And it was still the worst migraine of my life .
Qelbree destroyed a month of my life,"My son was on Adderall xr and immediate prior to this, we suspected the Adderall was exacerbating his anxiety and switched to this. ADHD seems under control on good days, but half the days he is so disassociated. Also been taking longer to fall asleep about about 50-% of the time also not sleeping through the night. Wondering if we push through the side effects and keep going and  see if we get relief or not. 12 days on med. Followup with Dr 12/9"
Qelbree destroyed a month of my life,"Honestly, not sleeping through the night seems to be a side effect, IMHO.

You‚Äôve seen my review at least."
First night on qelbree,I always took mine in the morning for this reason
First night on qelbree,"I definitely recommend taking it in the morning. I felt a buzz from the meds a couple hours after my first dose *and* couldn't sleep in the evening. Bad sleep has lasted me multiple days too, so please try to take it easy as much as you can in the coming days."
First night on qelbree,"Update for anyone concerned or interested‚Ä¶. All day I felt out of body. Felt like I was on the verge of a panic attack and that feeling just extended all the way into the afternoon. It finally started to go away in the evening and now at midnight I‚Äôm still feeling strange but almost back to normal. Idk if I can continue right now, since I‚Äôve got family and thanksgiving and I‚Äôm planning to go out with some friends. I was suuuper pissy at my parents like really really angry. 1st day was not good"
Constant feeling of being on edge/ anxiety/ depressive thoughts,"Coming from a person with lifelong anxiety, and recent chronic GI issues and mental health diagnosis:

I get the impression that it may be more helpful to treat your anxiety/depression before your ADHD. It sounds like you're having a lot of intense symptoms that need to be taken seriously, and ADHD meds will often aggravate anxiety. 

I've also learned a lot through therapy: breathing exercises, prioritizing my most critical needs and finding accommodations, reframing my thoughts. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is where most people start, but trying different styles of therapy was helpful for me. Internal Family Systems is a newly popular one that I tried, I like the idea of it but not sure about my actual therapist. Trying multiple therapists until you genuinely feel comfortable is important IMO. 

Last recommendation is to look into short term disability if you have access to it through work. It's been extremely helpful for me to focus on my health without any extra stress. 

So sorry you're going through this nightmare right now. Remember you still have choices you can make for your care. You are not hopeless. You are not alone."
Constant feeling of being on edge/ anxiety/ depressive thoughts,My son is on it and we recently increased from 300mg to 400mg. After a couple weeks his anxiety went through the roof. Doctor said it was too high so we went back to 300mg.
Anyone have any success appealing their insurance to cover this medicine?,Yes!  My doctor had to request a peer to peer meeting an it was approved after that.   He really went to bat for me and I appreciate it.  But note that I do have cardiac issues which eliminate two of the other options of non stimulants (and exclude all stimulants as well). and the third (Strattera) gave me awful side effects.
Anyone have any success appealing their insurance to cover this medicine?,"what benefits have you noticed ,if you don‚Äôt mind me asking?"
Anyone have any success appealing their insurance to cover this medicine?,Yes. Bcbs made me try Straterra and retry Adderall and when we have the same issues as before they approved my 400mg for going on a year now.
Anyone have any success appealing their insurance to cover this medicine?,Did you try any stimulants before qelbree? Just curious given you‚Äôve had a good experience so far!
Anyone have any success appealing their insurance to cover this medicine?,"I did have success. I was firm with the company when I called. Asked what alternatives where covered, made sure to ask everyone‚Äôs name and said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre telling me that a doctor has recommended this medicine for my health and you will neither cover this medicine nor offer an alternative that is covered by your organization?‚Äù

Then I asked to get a written notice to that effect mailed to my house for my records. 

Later that day I was told they would cover my medicine."
Anyone have any success appealing their insurance to cover this medicine?,"If you are in California there's a law that protects you from when an insurance company covers it and decides not to. 

That being said, yes I was able to get my insurance  company to cover it after a denial. Previous insurance company initially denied it as well, but accepted my Genesite test as good enough (Qelbree is literally the only ADHD med I can have with the lowest risk of side effects according to the test).

Newer insurance company denied it and put up a fight for a few months until they tied themselves into a knot and had to cover it. 

Being as I had a highly negative experience on stimulants, they wanted me to try 3 other non-stims before they would consider covering Qelbree. I told them no, my doctor sent them another request, they denied it again. I called and was told that I was not at the ""ideal age"" for two of the three medications (I got it in writing). 

Spouse and I discovered before agreeing to try the third medication that it has an ingredient my dermatologist told me to stay away from due to my skin reactions. Sent insurance that, they responded back saying to try the other two. 

So I called them again, sent the emails and letters and asked them what the next step was and they immediately covered it."
Anyone have any success appealing their insurance to cover this medicine?,"The main area in my life I see a difference in is work and in social situations. I‚Äôve always struggled with anxiety at work. It‚Äôs prevented me from being able to make phone calls, stay on top of my workload, and just being able to interact like a normal human. After a month of bad side effects from Qelbree, suddenly everything clicked and now I‚Äôm functioning like a (mostly) normal person. I have my bad days. But there‚Äôs no negative side effects like crashes, headaches, or dry mouth like other meds gave me. It‚Äôs been a game changer for me."
Anyone have any success appealing their insurance to cover this medicine?,"This is very helpful..thank you. I wonder if I can ‚Äútry‚Äù strattera again for a little and just say it didn‚Äôt work. As for the adderall, my doctor won‚Äôt prescribe me stimulants due to me being a recovering addict."
Anyone have any success appealing their insurance to cover this medicine?,"My psychiatrist will only let me try one stimulant, concerta. I‚Äôm a recovering addict (used to be addicted to Xanax) and she thinks short acting stimulants aren‚Äôt a good idea for someone who used to enjoy popping pills."
Anyone have any success appealing their insurance to cover this medicine?,awesome!! have you noticed it helping with executive function?
Positive/neutral experience so far ,"I'm on my first week of it at 200mg (going up to 400mg tomorrow).  This is the first ADHD med that hasn't raised my heartrate and anxiety.  My brain is ""quiet"" and I have a MUCH easier time starting tasks that I need to do.  The only negatives I have so far is constipation (but I tend to go through phases where I don't drink enough water or get enough fiber, so that could partially be on me) and maaaaybe some sleep issues (but like, I sometimes am just not tired and will stay up past 2am anyway).  I got diagnosed with ADHD back in the early 00's.  Have tried every ADHD medicine out there since.  Gave up several years ago and just focused on my anxiety/depression issues.  I just decided to bring up the subject with my doctor last year and he told me that they have a couple non stimulants these days.  So I tried Strattera.  Worked decently but made me sweat like crazy for no reason.  I already live in the deep south and get easily overstimulated when sweaty plus skin irritation.  So I gave up on that.  Went back to Concerta for a bit, remembered how much I hate it.  Asked my doctor if there was anything else to try as far as non stimulants and he gave me Qelbree.  I really like it so far.  Hoping the constipation issues lessen over time."
Positive/neutral experience so far ,I took it for the first 3 days and my family couldnt it anymore. It makes me jittery and irritable. I stopped taking it for 2 days with intentions of speaking to my doctor about dose and how long this side effect takes to level out... had no Idea for the 1st day by that evening though I got a migraine(I have a history of them though; havent had one in months but attributed it to that). Reddit actually helped clue me in to the fact you cant just stop taking this one. I started back 3 days ago and the lack of sleep is getting to me. I bought some 5mg melatonin... why do u not reccommend it exactly?
Positive/neutral experience so far ,"Thank you for sharing! I only got diagnosed with ADHD this year, so I'm still trying to figure out what meds and accessibilities I need for myself. I haven't tried stimulants or stratterra yet, so I'm glad I'm not missing out there"
Positive/neutral experience so far ,"Combining meds that make you awake and make you sleepy tend to not be great for your body. I know for me it felt more torturous to be tired while not being able to sleep, than just staying awake until my body was ready for sleep.

Sounds like you're a week in though, and losing sleep for that long can be actually harmful. Did your doctor give the ok for melatonin? I have yet to ask my doctor how to deal with the side effects."
Anyone Know If DE-CAF Coffee Has Any Effect With Qelbree ? ,"Nope, decaf has no effect, you're good to go! I switched to decaf for the same reason."
Anyone Know If DE-CAF Coffee Has Any Effect With Qelbree ? ,"Keep in mind that decaf still has *some* caffeine. Usually maxing out around 10mg per 8oz. So you might feel something if you're drinking a trenta or 4+ cups a day, but you're probably fine :)"
Anyone Know If DE-CAF Coffee Has Any Effect With Qelbree ? ,I had to quit decaf because it was giving me palpitations and anxiety. Psych said it affects everyone differently.
Anyone Know If DE-CAF Coffee Has Any Effect With Qelbree ? ,"Ooo okay thank you! At most I only drink 10oz in a day so I'll just have to try some Decaf and hopefully not 

üí•explodeüí•"
Anyone Know If DE-CAF Coffee Has Any Effect With Qelbree ? ,Ahhh okay seems ill just have to try it one day and see what happens!
Dosage Decrease works better??,Yeah my son went up to 400mg and was fine for a few weeks. Then he started to get over the top anxious and irritable. Went back to 300mg and all good
Dosage Decrease works better??,I feel like that is about what happened with me. My husband was getting worried cause I was talking so so fast and my words were just jumbled together. Inwas gittery and anxious all the time. Never thought upping it would make a difference like that.
6 year old prescribed Qelbree. Any advice?,"As with a lot of drugs, you have to taper off these if you want to stop.   There's a lot of stories here about adults missing a dose and getting migraines.

I missed a dose and I did get a headache, but it wasn't terrible and 500mg of tylenol took care of it

I think there's a facebook group that deals with kids and this drug, seems like mostly adult patients post here"
6 year old prescribed Qelbree. Any advice?,"No personal or anecdotal experience, no knowledge of the effects of withdrawal in children, and not a doctor or pediatrician - but I've been on Qelbree's side effect webpage to look at the most common side effects in individuals aged 6-17 and individuals aged 18+. As you can see, headaches and migraines don't make the common side effect list for kids: https://www.qelbreehcp.com/side-effects"
6 year old prescribed Qelbree. Any advice?,"I'd say don't start it right away. Wait at least 3 days to a week, but then refill it at the exact time that you are supposed to. A couple have posters have mentioned it is starting to get back ordered in their area and they have had to go several days without and experienced horrible withdrawals. If that happens in your area, you will now have a 3 to 7 day window, while waiting for meds to come in."
6 year old prescribed Qelbree. Any advice?,My son takes it. He never had any bad side effects. The only thing was sleep issues the first few weeks but we changed the time he gets it.
6 year old prescribed Qelbree. Any advice?,"I had a really bad experience getting off of Qelbree. It caused me disassociation and feelings of disconnect. I was on a very low dose, but when I stopped it, I experience the worst migraine of my life. I was in horrific pain and was severely ill for days. 

I know different people react differently to different medicines, but I've read about a lot of people here that have been through similar withdrawal symptoms with Qelbree. I personally wouldn't want to risk it. I wish you luck!"
6 year old prescribed Qelbree. Any advice?,Been on it and can‚Äôt believe it is for kids. Altered my sense of self and made me feel disassociated. In my opinion no one under 16 should be on this.
Is it normal to have no improvement after 1 month on Qelbree?,"I started on 200mg and didn't notice any improvement, but a bunch of side effects. I was convinced I'd be asking my psych to take me off it next appointment. But the moment I moved up to 400mg, the change was obvious and immediate. Do with that what you will"
Is it normal to have no improvement after 1 month on Qelbree?,Ive been on 200 for about a week and still don‚Äôt feel too many benefits either. But I did want to say that a fiber supplement has really helped the constipation for me. I also am drinking more water as well but I definitely have noticed a huge difference since upping my fiber. I got the Metamucil fiber gummies. Hope that helps with that at least
Is it normal to have no improvement after 1 month on Qelbree?,"I started on 200mg. I tried it for a week and a couple days, I had every side effect possible. But I did notice an improvement in my adhd. But if you‚Äôre having no improvement I‚Äôd recommend getting off it and talking to your psychiatrist."
Is it normal to have no improvement after 1 month on Qelbree?,"You‚Äôre not alone in that, I started at 100mg , didn‚Äôt notice a difference just went up to 150mg still nothing, so I‚Äôm going up to 200mg. Hopefully, if you decide to keep taking it your side effects will lessen as your body adjust then maybe going up will give you better benefits , maybe you could try 150mg before 200mg , I‚Äôd ask your dr about it if you‚Äôd like. I hope you get things figured out, hang in there it‚Äôs always hard trying out medications figuring out what‚Äôs best.!ü§ç"
Is it normal to have no improvement after 1 month on Qelbree?,"I started noticing improvements at 300mg.   (at 600mg now)

I also went up slowly, 50mg per week (had to divide the beads in the capsule).   Now I have almost no side effects unless I have any amount of caffeine."
Is it normal to have no improvement after 1 month on Qelbree?,Same with me.
"I have bad experiences with other ADHD medications, but so far Qelbree is working. I had bad side effects that mostly went away after a week.","Your call out on anxiety matches some of my experience. I am WAY less anxious throughout my workday and get way more done. But I am WAY more anxious when I first wake up. Probably doesn‚Äôt help that I am sleeping worse but feel this optimism during the day that everything will work out. 

I am only on day 5 of the increased dose to 400mg but I also feel pretty immediate impacts."
"I have bad experiences with other ADHD medications, but so far Qelbree is working. I had bad side effects that mostly went away after a week.","yea definitely starts working immediately and i can understand the parallels you see vs stimulants. for me it increases wakefulness too. it really doesnt do much as far as dopamine is concerned which is a good thing because that makes it non-addictive! norepinepherine is responsible for focus anyhow, so the only thing this medication lacks is the motivation that dopamine gives. DONT FUCKING ABRUPTLY STOP TAKING IT THOUGH. shit landed me in the ER this past weekend!"
"I have bad experiences with other ADHD medications, but so far Qelbree is working. I had bad side effects that mostly went away after a week.",Tonight I got really anxious and irritable so I'm not sure this is working after all. I'm going to stick to it for a few more weeks but I might have to quit.
"I have bad experiences with other ADHD medications, but so far Qelbree is working. I had bad side effects that mostly went away after a week.",Me too . Iam scared
"I have bad experiences with other ADHD medications, but so far Qelbree is working. I had bad side effects that mostly went away after a week.","Really weird that your dr says it doesn't do anything right away.  I noticed it on day one.  My brain was ""quiet"" for the first time in, idk how long.  Stimulant ADHD meds always put my anxiety & heart rate through the roof.  I tried tons of them over the years and finally gave up.  Hears about non stimulant meds and talked to my doctor.  He put me on Strattera which worked well but made me sweat like crazy for no reason.  Nothing overstimulates me faster than sweating... and I live in the deep south.  Bad combo!  Started on Qelbree a week ago and it's great.  I have been a bit constipated but gonna take more fiber and stuff and see if that doesn't straighten things out for me.  But yea, when my brain is ""quiet"" like this, I don't get overstimulated nearly as fast by noise.  Normally a trip to Costco has me in a whole mood by the end of it.  My mood stayed steady all the way through this time."
"I have bad experiences with other ADHD medications, but so far Qelbree is working. I had bad side effects that mostly went away after a week.",Oh wow‚Ä¶. Thanks for letting us know .. I‚Äôm starting this soon and sometimes I‚Äôve abruptly stopped meds in this past. Did you just go from the 400 to 200mg?
"I have bad experiences with other ADHD medications, but so far Qelbree is working. I had bad side effects that mostly went away after a week.","Yeah when I missed a dose because of the pharmacy, I also ended up in an ER because my head ache was intolerable."
"I have bad experiences with other ADHD medications, but so far Qelbree is working. I had bad side effects that mostly went away after a week.",Starting this tomorrow not looking forward to it after some of comments/post I‚Äôve read
"I have bad experiences with other ADHD medications, but so far Qelbree is working. I had bad side effects that mostly went away after a week.",went from 400 a day to 0 because of a pharmacy delay on ordering it. just make sure they order it ahead of time. a simple quick convo with the pharmacist should make this a non-issue
"I have bad experiences with other ADHD medications, but so far Qelbree is working. I had bad side effects that mostly went away after a week.",What were the symptoms that landed you in the hospital?! I have the sample as of rn from the doctor so will make sure to talk to the pharmacy ahead of time
"I have bad experiences with other ADHD medications, but so far Qelbree is working. I had bad side effects that mostly went away after a week.",you just suddenly get a horrific migraine and puke a bunch. it is unfortunately spoken of very frequently on this sub. i just went to ER for migraine meds pretty much. once they gave me whatever they gave me it got better.
Just Took My First Ever Dose Of Qelbree ,I'm following cause my doctor wants me to start it. Please keep us updated. I hope it works for you.
Just Took My First Ever Dose Of Qelbree ,"This isn‚Äôt like stimulants for ADHD where you‚Äôre necessary going to ‚Äúfeel it‚Äù it‚Äôs more like an antidepressant where once the medication levels off in your bloodstream is when you get the full effects. That being said SNRI‚Äôs do have a slight ‚Äústimulating‚Äù feel when I first take them. It happened with this and when I used to take Cymbalta for major depressive disorder. That effect goes away after I adjust to the medication though. 

Also for side effects, just a slight headache the first few weeks. Dry mouth that has improved over the time I‚Äôve been on it (3 months or so). There was that slight ‚Äústimulant‚Äù effect that wore off after a week or so.

Also, for me, the interaction with caffeine seems to have gone away. I can drink coffee/energy drinks and they affect me the same as they always have.

I‚Äôve also missed doses and never had any of the migraines or sever withdrawal symptoms some people seem to have. 

Good luck!

Edit: Forgot to add how well it works! lol so I‚Äôve been on every kind of ADHD medication they make. I haven‚Äôt tried one since I gave up around 2002 when straterra didn‚Äôt work for me and I can no longer handle the side effects of long term stimulant use. I just started grad school for public health and it has been really helpful to me."
Just Took My First Ever Dose Of Qelbree ,Weird to feel it so fast because I don‚Äôt think the mechanism of the medication works that fast digestive wise. I def feel a few hours after tho.
Just Took My First Ever Dose Of Qelbree ,"Hey there!  I hope this medication works out for you!  I don‚Äôt say this to scare you, but just so you‚Äôre aware - if this med doesn‚Äôt work out for you (it‚Äôs not for everyone, which is ok!) make sure you taper yourself off instead of just quitting!

Editing to add: there‚Äôs a pinned post at the top of the sub!  There‚Äôs some negative stories in there (including mine) but don‚Äôt be scared, I put it there so that people who take it can learn about it!  Qelbree is a fairly new med, so people sharing their experiences here is a fantastic resource!"
Just Took My First Ever Dose Of Qelbree ,"Im on day one as well. About an hour and a half in. I am also feeling that slight tingle mainly in my head. It feels kinda like a very mild version of the prickle I got from C4 pre-work out back when I took it.

Im not sure if it's a thing or if I am just hyper fixated on my body right now and miss interpritting regular sensations I dont normally pay attention to."
Just Took My First Ever Dose Of Qelbree ,"Im on day 7 or 8 of a 200mg dose(changed from 40mg strattera). I had to stop taking it for a couple days after day 5...
Im wondering if its a reaction with my other meds now so I took just the Qelbree today to see, but after being on it 5 days in a row that ""slight buzzing"" youre talking about turned in to an anxious feeling I couldnt get rid of. My family described me as ""everything makes you angry or irritated"" and Id say its a pretty accurate description of the feeling. I feel like Ive taken stimulants and I havent. 
I really hope its just a reaction to other meds or it will level out and that side effect will go away... just listen to your body(and doctor) while taking it(or any medication for that matter) and adjust accordingly. üôè Hope it works for you and you are doing well."
Just Took My First Ever Dose Of Qelbree ,Okay! I'll do my best ! Yea i hope it works too!
Just Took My First Ever Dose Of Qelbree ,It works great for me!
Just Took My First Ever Dose Of Qelbree ,"Niceee!! Thanks for that info!! Yea my psychiatrist made me aware of the exact kind of med it is, but she didn't say anything about this initial stimulant-like effect! 

Im definitely trusting this process though, especially it being this early on!"
Just Took My First Ever Dose Of Qelbree ,Yea i mean what I was feeling was very very slight. Like a slight buzzing.
Just Took My First Ever Dose Of Qelbree ,"Thank you!! Yea I've read lots of negative stories but also honestly a pretty equal amount of positive ones! So all I can do is trust the process and track my own progress! 

Also i find that these kinds of posts where people update their own progress are super insightful and helpful for putting in perspective so that's why I decided to make this post in that same format  ! :D"
Just Took My First Ever Dose Of Qelbree ,Ask your doctor to get you a prescription savings card off line. Its just 2 sheets they print out and you take to your pharmacy; it will have all the info tgey usually turn in for insurance and MIGHT make it cheap enough you can afford without insurance... Its a shot in the dark but worth a try ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è the worst they can do is say no; they cant eat you...
Just Took My First Ever Dose Of Qelbree ,Yea that second part i relate to a lot!! That's why I probably won't update for a few days because I need to make sure I'm not just hyper fixating on my body!
Just Took My First Ever Dose Of Qelbree ,Also good luck and hope this medicine works for us!
Just Took My First Ever Dose Of Qelbree ,"Oooooo that's unfortunate! I mean from what I read about people's experiences,  a common theme is the various and kinda uncomfortable side effects that can come with this medicine,  but then fortunately another thing i kept seeing different people say is that those side effects do go away eventually and that's when you start really feeling the good its doing for you! 

So yea im hoping this medicine works for both of us!"
Just Took My First Ever Dose Of Qelbree ,Just updated the post btw :)
Just Took My First Ever Dose Of Qelbree ,How are you feeling?
Just Took My First Ever Dose Of Qelbree ,niceee!
Just Took My First Ever Dose Of Qelbree ,"Lol, my wife has found that we are reaching a bit of an insurance issue, so hopefully, my medicated journey continues."
Just Took My First Ever Dose Of Qelbree ,Just updated the post friend :)
Just Took My First Ever Dose Of Qelbree ,After taking a nap I don't feel much anymore! Nothing worth noting! Tomorrow will be the second dose and I may or may not update the post depending on what happens! If it's just the same as today I don't think I'll update. I definitely wanna give this some time to get in my system.
Just Took My First Ever Dose Of Qelbree ,"Oh gosh,  let me tell you it took my insurance FOREVER to approve this medicine for some reason. Then they sent it to the wrong pharmacy! Hoping the best 4 √ú !!"
Just Took My First Ever Dose Of Qelbree ,So glad to see you doing so good!
Just Took My First Ever Dose Of Qelbree ,"Hopeing! I got 3 weeks (just 200 mg, though) free from my doc as a sample. So I can get started whole we work it out."
Just Took My First Ever Dose Of Qelbree ,Nice!! I'm on 200mg also actually!
Just Took My First Ever Dose Of Qelbree ,"Well, Im surprised to go to 400 in t weeks"
Just Took My First Ever Dose Of Qelbree ,Will you be taking yours in the morning or at night?
Just Took My First Ever Dose Of Qelbree ,Doing morning for now. Just took day 2.
Just Took My First Ever Dose Of Qelbree ,niceee haha today was day 3 for me and I just updated the post!
Just Took My First Ever Dose Of Qelbree ,"2 wasn't so bad for me. Just some fatigue but not work, so I had some solid naps."
Not caring or interested in anything? ,Damn. The exact opposite for me. Sorry to hear that. Should check in with your doctor.
Not caring or interested in anything? ,"Same. It's made me into nothing. I'm not sad, but not happy. I'm not super tired but I don't have  more energy. My mind is quiet, which is good, but I'm quiet too, I have no desire to talk. I'm not grumping on family members but I don't feel love towards them either. All my emotions and desires are gone and the only thing I accomplished was two loads of laundry and only one of those was folded and put away. Oh and I took a shower. Vyvanse didn't work. Quelbree not working. My brain is bankrupt I guess :("
Not caring or interested in anything? ,This is 100% what happened to me on it.
Not caring or interested in anything? ,"Sort of feel that a little bit, I‚Äôm about 6 weeks in, but I‚Äôve been feeling like that before"
Not caring or interested in anything? ,"I'm 4.5 months in, 4 months total on 400mg. I have days where I'm productive (though nothing compared to Vyvanse) but they're few and far between. I think the most effective part of the Qelbree for me has been squashing my anxiety around starting a task (though not very well, because I'm struggling to keep up with simple coursework.) When I was on Vyvanse, I always told my doctors I felt as though something was missing, I tried several medicines in combination with V (Lexapro, wellbutrin, Prozac, etc.) but none worked. I think Qelbree might have been the missing link, but as I'm reticent to go back on Vyvanse (I really don't like the insomnia and 'robot mode' I go into) I have an appointment with my doc soon and I plan to ask about non-amphetamine stimulant options, I've heard of Azstarys, Jornay, Provigil, & Focalin being prescribed to folks on here who also take Qelbree. I'll let you all know if I get my fatigue sorted out! It's been one of the biggest pains of my ADHD symptoms, nobody likes being tired constantly, especially on a medication that's supposed to help you focus."
Not caring or interested in anything? ,Have you tried adderall?
Not caring or interested in anything? ,"Yes, Adderall works better but I metabolize IR in about 2 hours and XR in about 4. So that's why the switch to Vyvanse. I up my Qelbree tomorrow and maybe my Vyvanse after that. I don't really know anything about Dopamine, or Norepinephrine or how these meds work, but I had an MRI 4 or 5 years ago (because I was convinced that I must have early onset Alzheimers) and it was normal. So I don't know why the meds affect me this way, but thanks to OPs post. It sounds similar to me and that I'm not the only one."
Not caring or interested in anything? ,Idk where I read it but supposedly you can get a test to check which stims work best. Maybe it‚Äôs this post haven‚Äôt checked lol but that really is hard. I know it‚Äôs frustrating when you want to function and feel ‚Äúnormal/ok‚Äù. You take both qelbree and vyvanse? I need to look into taking both and what the effects are. Was on adderall XR for longest time. No issues and worked fine except for the fact that I have clients/grad school in the afternoon and by that time my meds are worn off. I take it at 9 and by 3/4 I‚Äôm cooked. Vyvanse gave me headaches sometimes and I felt more blank and zoned out not necessarily focused‚Ä¶ also it made me tired which is strange yet I couldn‚Äôt sleep idk. Now doctor took me off stimulants fully idk why really kind of pissed about it but told me to try a non stim for awhile I have qelbree in my bag just waiting for me to take it and I‚Äôm scared.
Not caring or interested in anything? ,"I slept the whole first month on Vyvanse. I would sleep through the night and take 2 to 3 hr naps. My psych upped my dose. I still sleep through the night but only take like 15-20 min naps and that doesn't happen everyday. I waited to start Qelbree on the weekend and I take it at bedtime and Vyvanse 50 in the am. Also, there is now a shortage on Qelbree in some places. So refill your prescription when it is due even though you haven't started it yet, so you have a buffer supply, just in case you like it and it's hard to refill. I have fallen asleep and missed my dose twice. I did not get a migraine like others have reported but I'm already on a migraine prevention med but I did cry the whole next day both times and I never cry."
Med Combos?,"I had a weird and interesting experience with Adderall and Qelbree. 

I took Qelbree for the first time ever yesterday and immediately noticed some benefits. People have been saying it takes a few weeks to feel anything but I immediately noticed a difference although small, but it came with side effects.

The biggest issue was insomnia like others. Feelings of restlessness and discomfort staying still, dry lips and a bit of nausea.

Anyhow the insomnia was so bad I was up till 7am unable to get any ounce of sleep tossing and turning. It felt like my body was unable to relax because of the meds. Anyhow I decided I would take some Adderall from a prior prescription because I needed to get to work since it was already morning. The plan was to power through until the night since I was still unable to fall asleep.

After taking the Adderall what was weird was I felt more relaxed, so I tried to take a quick nap. I ended up sleeping for an hour and it was a very relaxing sleep, one of the best I‚Äôve ever had. 

I was also very surprised I could fall asleep on Adderall because I normally would be wired and unable to do so. Furthermore after taking the Adderall my constipation seemed to almost fade. 

Idk the science behind the two drug interactions but my layman guess is it has to do with the added dopamine from Adderall which Qelbree doesn‚Äôt actually provide as it only regulates norepinephrine and serotonin. 

But taking Adderall seemed to lessen the side effects of Qelbree. 

Given it‚Äôs only been one day though I feel like there‚Äôs not enough data and I might test this further. But I will say that I did feel a very rapid change after taking the Adderall, feeling more relaxed and less anxiety while on Qelbree alone I felt very tense and heightened anxiety. 

Maybe this is only an isolated one time thing but if I find out more I will make a separate post about this."
Med Combos?,I've been on Qelbree 200mg daily for almost 2 years and I get a migraine any time I miss a dose. I am not a regular migraine sufferer and my only other meds are for nlood pressure and allergies. It does seem like a Qelbree thing. Hope this helps.
Med Combos?,"I've noticed that in the firsy year and while ramping up doses, I had insomnia unless I took Qelbree first thing after waking up. If I took it past 9 am I'd be wide awake at 9 pmüò≥"
Just started taking qelbree for ADHD,I‚Äôm like 2 weeks in and it keeps getting better and better. Not sleeping great but almost everything else is improved.
Just started taking qelbree for ADHD,"I was weird for a few weeks but not anymore. I‚Äôm about 6 months in and feel good. 

Missing a dose is absolutely awful but otherwise I‚Äôm so glad to be on qelbree. I hope it treats you well."
Just started taking qelbree for ADHD,"My husband says I'm just quiet now, no laughter, no personality and I haven't noticed any benefits at least your getting some benefits out of it."
Just started taking qelbree for ADHD,"I was off while starting on it a bit. Nothing super noticeable to me but I was a lot quieter. Once it got in my system and I found the right dose for me I was back to normal. 

I've been on it about a year and have very minimal side effects unless I've missed a dose (when I have it wasn't my fault)."
Just started taking qelbree for ADHD,"Hey! On month 2 - first month at 200 - side effects were annoying but def feeling the ‚Äúmind quieting‚Äù effects - now at 300, while our goal dose is 400. It‚Äôs evening out and things are getting better. I‚Äôd give it - as I am - a few months before making any big decisions about it"
Just started taking qelbree for ADHD,yea person above is right. dont miss a dose and keep ahead of the refills. like this shit is no joke!
Just started taking qelbree for ADHD,"I‚Äôd also like to stress this‚Ä¶ my pharmacy was delayed a couple days and I was out of the Qelbree, and got the worst headache of my life! Definitely stay on top of it."
Not for me (I think?),"I'm on 600 mg - worked up from 200
I cannot believe how my anxiety has disappeared- I have dropped down on Xanax xr- I am on 200 of lamictal which I'm weaning off because I have been mis diagnosed for years as being bi- polar- so happy I found Q - I wasted 15 yrs on all the wrong meds. With that said I didn't get any side effects which I was actually shocked about cell I am always trying to figure out if there's a correlation between if you get side effects or you don't but I don't think so. I am not a doctor but if you could get through the side effects I would try unless it's really ruining your life but I have read on different sites that once people get through the side effects it is life-changing. ü§ûüèº"
Not for me (I think?),"Make sure the migraine isn't caused by high blood pressure. If so, that's an easy fix."
Not for me (I think?),"I didn't have high blood pressure beforehand. Qelbree doesn't cause high blood pressure, does it?"
Not for me (I think?),Strattera did and so did Qelbree for me. Doesn't hurt to check it just to make sure it's not the cause of your headaches. It was for me and I got put on Lisinopril and fixed it.
Not for me (I think?),"It is one of the things listed under the ‚Äúimportant safety information‚Äù 

https://www.qelbree.com/adults/adhd-treatment-with-qelbree#safety-profile"
Not for me (I think?),"crazy how ""massive discontinuation symptoms such as projectile vomiting and cluster fucking migrane"" isnt included here."
Not for me (I think?),Yeaaaa honestly that‚Äôs what keeps me going on it. I had primarily been on stimulants before which for me were ok to miss a dose here or there. But they just weren‚Äôt effective. Qelbree has been a godsend but these withdrawal symptoms scare me into making sure I do not forget a dose.
forget what i said,You doing ok?
forget what i said,"still have a pretty shit headache *after* being at the hospital all night. people were right 800mg advil and 600mg tylenol doesnt TOUCH this headache. the puking was so bad that i still cant swallow a pill easily due to my throat being fucked.

i think qelbree does have a benefit, but i am not willing to go through this again if there is a pharmacy problem ordering it every month. i am going to stay off of it for a few days and see how disorganized i get."
forget what i said,"I hope you feel better soon - I'd never had a headache that made me throw up before, and that withdrawal one sure did it!  If I missed a dose it was hard to make the correlation since it was uncommon and it took like 2-3 days to show up.  It was beneficial to me too, but not enough that the 200 worked, and the 400 made me so anxious and depressed I was crying nonstop and having panic attacks at work, neither of which have ever happened to me before, so I had to stop.  I think that if I'd been able to do 300, that would have been fantastic, but oh well.  I found a better one that works for me!"
forget what i said,May I ask what you switched to?
forget what i said,"Absolutely!  First I switched to Strattera (atomoxetine) which I didn‚Äôt like - it gave me ‚Äúcramps‚Äù all month (even outside of girly-week) and also really bad leg cramps.  It also made my head feel ‚Äúbuzzy‚Äù.

Now I‚Äôm taking Guanfacine ER (Intuniv) and while it doesn‚Äôt work as well as the Qelbree, it works well for me"
Day 1 on Qelbree,"It takes almost a month before you start to really feel the full effects. 

Be mindful of caffeine. I have had to become more cautious about my intake of it; Qelbree prevents it from being broken down as quickly."
Day 1 on Qelbree,"I was in your situation like 2 weeks ago! Never been on a medication like this and kinda terrified. I had to remember an experience I had when I was younger and needed to go on Acutane for how bad my acne was getting. I went online read all the horror stories and backed out completely, couple months later acne was so bad I just said fuck it. Ended up being one of the best medications I have ever taken in my entire life. 

Point of the story is people only go online to talk about there horror stories. People that are doing good don‚Äôt really need to do that. 

I felt really weird the first week, like out of it and anxious . People keep saying it takes awhile to get in your system so I‚Äôm not waiting. If you want to DM me we can keep in touch about our progression and see how we are doing. It‚Äôs lonely out here being on Q by myself!"
Day 1 on Qelbree,that‚Äôs what i‚Äôve heard! i normally have one coffee a day in the morning so not sure if it‚Äôs worth testing out or just waiting altogether?
Day 1 on Qelbree,I just started and I'm one 100 for 7 days and going up to 200 after. How much did you all start on and how are things going? I've been on Methylphenidate for years I'm 36 and now I'm starting to have adverse reactions like mood swings and shortness of breathe. Crazy how it switched up. So now I'm trying qelbree. I hope it works cause i ¬†need it.¬†
Day 1 on Qelbree,"I waited until I adjusted to it before I started drinking coffee again. I would say if you aren‚Äôt caffeine dependent, then to wait until you get used to the Qelbree."
Day 1 on Qelbree,"I just did they and am now ending my first week on 200. I don‚Äôt really know how to describe my experience. It has been very minimal, not many side effects, don‚Äôt really feel that my attention and task management has been better. I have noticed the negative thoughts about not getting stuff done have gotten easier. 

I‚Äôm just waiting as people say it can take a month to start working so trying not to jump the gun to soon and make any conclusions."
Switching from a Stimulant because of having OCD too‚Ä¶,"Yes. I started on Bupropion 150xl (it's an NDRI, but is similar in chemical composition to bathsalts, a synthetic stimulant) as a mild relief to my ADHD/ADD but only gave me dopamine while still easily getting distracted, potency is very low and gradual. I had to up to 300xl and still no relief but instead got agitated and  hypervigilant easier due to the higher Norepinephrine(fight-mode)coming from Bup and Qelbree now. 

Now I'm off Bup and on qelbree 200mg for 2 weeks, I'm still metabolizing the Bup out of my system and Qelbree relieved a few of my symptoms slowly over the days. After the 5th day I began feeling high like I smoked weed for the first time(I'm a cannabis med patient for 4 years now for PTSD and Autoimmune disorders.) this high feeling is still persistent to this day and intensifies as I smoke while at the same time slows down my perception of time allowing me to think a bit more clearly at a steadier pace. I smoke cannabis simply to help process these medications thoroughly, it's actually helped me in being more productive. 

Hope this helps somehow."
Switching from a Stimulant because of having OCD too‚Ä¶,Yes! I've been using it for years and I can't fathom going back to a stimulant. Buspar and vybriid have been helpful additions for me.
Switching from a Stimulant because of having OCD too‚Ä¶,Thank u so much. Bupropion gave me lots of anxiety too & it gave me PSSD which isn‚Äôt common because it‚Äôs on an SSRI. The Lexapro made me tired a lot & brain fog. Qelbree can take awhile to work right? Have u ever tried an SSRI for the ocd?
Switching from a Stimulant because of having OCD too‚Ä¶,"Thank u. Did the stimulants make u on edge & rumination worse about intrusive thoughts too?? Buspar I felt didn‚Äôt really do anything for me. How do u like Viibryd compared to SSRI‚Äôs? Any side effects on it like weight gain, sexual or tiredness?"
Switching from a Stimulant because of having OCD too‚Ä¶,"Bupropion is a double edged sword. It makes me happy while pumping me with Norepinephrine causing me to either go anxious or almost paranoid..

I take Sertraline 50mg for OCD and I feel like Im jumping into action before I even begin dwelling on a task. Sertraline and Qelbree for me has been pretty synergistic. I do find myself running out of OCD fixating gas later on the day so I've been breaking them into halfsies 25mg in the morning and in the afternoon. The family isn't as worried about my clean-freak tendencies lmao."
Switching from a Stimulant because of having OCD too‚Ä¶,"I‚Äôm way less tired. I actually worked for 13 hours straight on a project yesterday with zero need for my usual 3 hour midday nap. It‚Äôs also been two weeks since I switched to vybriid from Zoloft. I remember other medications hitting me with the involuntary naps by now, regardless of the qelbree, so ime the qelbree isn‚Äôt the problem with drowsiness. 
And weight is stable so far, it‚Äôs easier to find the will to workout. No decrease in libido, which buspar personally helped with.

Stimulants definitely made me focus on the most uncomfortable thoughts, and I used to tell myself it made me better at my job and all that, but in reality it was a very precarious way to live, not only because of shortages and the feeling of withdrawal or like I could skip weekends to take an extra dose on Monday, etc. it was precarious because the second I lost focus on a ‚Äúgood‚Äù or wanted thought/task, the negativity would rush in and I‚Äôd be 90% less effective, or ‚Äúhappy‚Äù"
Switching from a Stimulant because of having OCD too‚Ä¶,"Haha I hear ya! I had many of the clean freak earlier on, now I have more of the intrusive thoughts. Do u get those too? Any weight gain or sexual side effects with the Zoloft?"
Switching from a Stimulant because of having OCD too‚Ä¶,I‚Äôve read Prozac can be stimulating for people who have ADD too. Do u take the Viibryd at night or in the morning? Have u heard anything about the drug Intuniv which is similar to Qelbree?
Switching from a Stimulant because of having OCD too‚Ä¶,"Lots of intrusive thoughts here as well. Some suicidal ideations and zoning out into worse-case scenario thought-loops about loved ones.. Quite painful. It took a while to adjust to it and quiet down. It turns into white noise that clouds my focus sometimes. Which I suppose makes sense as to why Qelbree would fit in to the picture well. Sertraline is pretty activating for me, feels like an upper. I had a slight loss of appetite with it. 

Qelbree certainly kills the idea of appetite until I take the first bite, I'd say is a huge plus in comparison to Adderall killing appetite entirely. 

Libido did slightly decrease, but I was nympho as fuck before sertraline, Bup upped my sex drive, I wanted to fuck anything that moved. I did have issues with low sexual endurance which sertraline unironically boosted it."
Switching from a Stimulant because of having OCD too‚Ä¶,"No experience with intuniv but Prozac wasn‚Äôt for me at all.
I take my whole med stack at dinner just in case it makes me a bit drowsy, because prior to vybriid, dinner was a few hours before a reasonable time to let the involuntary nap hit me lol"
Switching from a Stimulant because of having OCD too‚Ä¶,I‚Äôve read Prozac & Zoloft are similar & both activating than the other SSRI‚Äôs. U think being a nymph came from the lower Dopamine in your system with the ADD or just always sexual??
Switching from a Stimulant because of having OCD too‚Ä¶,"Oh wow, why don‚Äôt u take the Qelbree in the AM for energy?"
Switching from a Stimulant because of having OCD too‚Ä¶,"My sex drive stemmed from sexual trauma so the excess dopamine from Bup+THC upped my sex drive and caused me to be nymphomaniac. pre-Sertraline would hyper-fixate on bodily details for the purpose of sex, so sex is slightly less stimulating so it helps with endurance. I am currently moderating dosage as this can backfire in the long run. 

I've always had a high sex-drive though."
Switching from a Stimulant because of having OCD too‚Ä¶,"No, I actually don‚Äôt notice it giving me any energy oddly. Definitely not as much/as noticeable energy as a stimulant medication. I think most people tend to feel sleepier than not on qelbree.
I actually don‚Äôt feel a need to drink caffeine on qelbree either. I‚Äôm usually just awake and calm/focused or I need a nap that can‚Äôt really be argued with lol"
Switching from a Stimulant because of having OCD too‚Ä¶,What‚Äôs the difference between Hypersexual vs Nympho??
Switching from a Stimulant because of having OCD too‚Ä¶,"They're kind of the same. Nympho is an old term for people that have no self-control when it comes to sex. Often the only thing that revolves around their mind is sex. Clouds cognitive function. Frequent sex

Hypersexual for me just means very high sex drive. Thinks about it very often. Frequent sex also.

Growing up I felt that nymphomania is a more serious condition than having hypersexual it.

Came to a point where all the thoughts I'd get is imagining every passerby without clothes imagining possibly with or without body hair. Couldn't answer simple questions Lmfao."
Switching from a Stimulant because of having OCD too‚Ä¶,I get that feeling when I see Hot Milfs lol
Switching from a Stimulant because of having OCD too‚Ä¶,I got it when I see anyone with a remotely attractive feature on their body or face. Or pretty much when we lock eyes.
Menstrual cycle ,I have only been on quellbre two three months but yes my periods too are weirder. I had two my second month in one month. I really like quellbre but I spent a lot of time getting my hormones and periods regular again so a little concerned
Menstrual cycle ,I'm in my second month of Quellbree and had a period 10 days ago and started again this morning. I have always been consistent with my periods. This is definitely unusual for me.
Menstrual cycle ,This feels like a weird thing that might be secondary and not directly related. Has the medicine caused you to lose weight or impacted your appetite a lot?
Menstrual cycle ,"I do have a pcos diagnosis, which was already hard to get because I had fairly regular periods. I've lost weight on the medication, but not a significant amount. My period before, I might have a little hiccup in my menstruation, but it always went back to normal. But now that I've started this medication it's been consistently INconsistent"
This might be long.,"I've been on both, and I can tell you this... those 2 drugs are nothing like Adderall. Sure, they're stimulants, but they're non addicting. That being said. I enjoyed strattera more than qelbree. I took them because of my adhd. I'm also on wellbutrin 3x a day. The only reason why I stopped taking my adhd meds was because it made my bladder super sensitive, and I wasn't able to hold in my pee at all.
I would run to the restroom every 5-10 minutes to pee. It felt like a uti minus the burning.
Everyone has different side effects. I never got migraines with qelbree, but I've noticed it's very common on a high dose, though. I was only on 100mg."
This might be long.,"I was taking Strattera for a while before I was taking Qelbree. I would describe it as helpful but not life changing. Oddly enough the reason I stopped was because it gave me woefully bad GI issues. Like heartburn, bloating and gas that was just continuous, which was weird because at the time I didn't see GI issues as common side effects. I even went to my general care practitioner to figure out what was going on, it was only after I stopped strattera that I realized it was the culprit."
This might be long.,"I come from a background of dopamine addicts. Grandparents were either schizo or BP. Father is schizo. I'm BP2. 50mg sertraline, 25-50mg quetiapine(depending on how much mental activity on the day) Bupropion 300xl. Qelbree 200mg. I was also a coke fien

I found that Bup and Qelbree don't mix well for me as I crave nicotine bigtime under Qelbree. Personally feels like way too much norepinephrine(fight mode) high irritability and agitation. Impulsive speech, increased sensitivity to audible and visual stimuli, kinda had to dumb it down with earbuds or smoke some cannabis(med patient) or gummies.

Sertraline numbs my emotions while eliminating my public anxiety almost entirely but causes my impulsive speech from qelbree to feel more reckless. I find myself double checking if I said things correctly as I felt so incoherent."
This might be long.,"I had so many bladder issues with wellbutrin!!! From other threads I‚Äôve read, it‚Äôs very common, especially at higher doses. I never would‚Äôve known & am so pissed I really missed 6 months of my life bc of it."
This might be long.,"Yeah, I‚Äôve read qelbree is not good for ppl w BP. Likely to have opposite of calming effect, & is more like, overstimulating & likely to induce mania. I feel the same exact thing w the nicotine!! Also felt agitated, like I wanted to go sprint but had zero energy to get out of the bed. It sucks, bc it actually does wake me up. I went down from 200mg to 100mg yesterday. Really hoping it‚Äôs better this way."
This might be long.,"I also had bladder issues when taking just auvelity & adderall. Hard to tell if the issues were from some of the adderall generics or auvelity (bupropion & dxm). I went to the doctor for uti so many times, & they said there were trace amounts of blood in my urine (indicating inflammation), but there was no uti. 

That time I was on bupropion in comment above, they diagnosed me with interstitial cystitis. Made me feel crazy, like what I was feeling wasn‚Äôt real. 

Also, if you ever take ketamine for depression, that has the same effect. 

Boric acid suppositories are actually the most amazing miracle worker."
This might be long.,"I've been on wellbutrin for about 2-3 years and I didn't have any side effects which is why I stuck with it because any other antidepressant gave me insane side effects like effexor gave me vivid dreams to the point that I didn't know if my waking life was a dream or not. Wellbutrin does have a bit of stimulant but not enough to trigger bladder problems but Jesus christ strattera and qelbree would not let me hold my pee in.
I work at 7/11 and I kinda sorta peed myself. It's embarrassing. 
And you know what's funny, I take Picot for my acid reflux and when I'm having bladder problems, it calms it down. I think it has boric acid as well."
Be so careful if you stop taking this medication. Tapered or abrupt.,"I had to taper off of Qelbree while trying to to get pregnant, and 2nd day after my last dose, I also had a migraine so bad I spent the day puking up bile and had to take a day off work. Luckily no hospital visit, and felt much better the next day (still had a migraine but no associated nausea). Headache totally gone after a few days. 

It helps so much with my productivity, circadian rhythm, and impulse control that I plan to get back on it as soon as I'm done with breastfeeding, if I can find a pharmacy that will fill it (the biggest issue for me). Even though the withdrawal suuuuuuuucks. It's worth it to me.

As nasty as the withdrawal side effects are, they are way way better (and shorter-lived) than tapering off of duloxetine, which was no joke the worst experience of my life."
Be so careful if you stop taking this medication. Tapered or abrupt.,"I strongly encourage you to share your experience in a comment on the pinned comment at the top of the sub!  I put it there to help people know ahead so that it doesn‚Äôt happen, and the more input on it the better!"
Be so careful if you stop taking this medication. Tapered or abrupt.,I have forgotten to take it for more than one day and never had anything like this happen at all. I guess some people are more sensitive than others.
Be so careful if you stop taking this medication. Tapered or abrupt.,"Yeah, I unfortunately found out about the headaches from my doctor accidentally writing my prescription for the wrong quantity and having to wait until Monday to get more. After missing both weekend doses, I woke up at about 12:30am Monday out of a dead sleep with the worst headache I‚Äôve ever had (and I have had migraines and post-concussion headaches many times) and severe nausea that resulted in a trip to the emergency room. Crazy how the manufacturer doesn‚Äôt really list those effects of discontinuation anywhere."
Be so careful if you stop taking this medication. Tapered or abrupt.,"I'm so sorry that happened to you. THIS is why I stopped taking it. I had forgotten to take it one morning after leaving for work, and I had the worst migraine and nausea in my life. It felt worse than a hangover. No other drug has ever done this to me before. The medication does work but has terrible consequences. It took me one week to adjust back to the medication after missing that ONE dose..I told my doctor I don't feel comfortable taking this anymore so she put me back on Adderall."
Be so careful if you stop taking this medication. Tapered or abrupt.,"I've had experience with many different drugs and had to withdraw from a few. I am tapering off from 400 mg. 2 weeks ago the pharmacy couldn't get it for 4 days and it was the single most frightening painful and anxiety ridden event I have had in 30 years. it is hard to believe that there is no better warning as to the side effects of withdrawal. I would not wish it on anybody, I understand why one would end up in the hospital because I almost ended up there myself."
Be so careful if you stop taking this medication. Tapered or abrupt.,"Same. Every time I miss a dose, I get awful headaches, dizzy, ‚Äúweird‚Äù feeling. I get so scared when the pharmacy runs out. It‚Äôs scary."
Be so careful if you stop taking this medication. Tapered or abrupt.,I‚Äôm shocked the medicine is allowed on the market. So many terrible side effects and I‚Äôm sorry nobody warned your husband about tapering down. People have spoken on opening their capsules just to be sure this sort of stuff doesn‚Äôt happen.
Be so careful if you stop taking this medication. Tapered or abrupt.,My thoughts exactly
Be so careful if you stop taking this medication. Tapered or abrupt.,How do express this type of concern to my psyc? Getting medication later in life I‚Äôm always so worried they think I‚Äôm trying to abuse stimulants when really I just need something as needed. I‚Äôm on Q now but this kind of shit terrifies me and might want to back out before I‚Äôm too deep in it
Be so careful if you stop taking this medication. Tapered or abrupt.,All medications have trade offs and it‚Äôs finding one that solves your unique biochemistry need. So far this med is changing my life for the better. Stopped drinking. Stopped binge eating. Work is way less over whelming. Feeling a feeling of optimism I‚Äôve not had in a decade. Anxiety reduced significantly. My down side is I‚Äôm not sleeping great but that‚Äôs just becuase I keep waking up at 4am feeling well rested and motivated to go.
Be so careful if you stop taking this medication. Tapered or abrupt.,"Once you start it, the risk of this is there when you stop it. You're already too deep, friend. I'm so sorry!"
Has anyone successfully gotten off Qelbree without a migraine?,"I did. I tapered for a few days until I was down to about 1/2 of a dose. But then I really needed to get off it quickly because it was inducing a manic-like state (not sure how else to describe it) where I wasn't eating or sleeping. So I just cold turkeyed it from there and I didn't have any issues. I'm not sure if the partial tapering in the beginning helped or what, but that's what I did and I didn't get a migraine at all."
Has anyone successfully gotten off Qelbree without a migraine?,"My husband only took it for a week and a half and it caused a manic depressive event , and he stopped taking it. The last time that he was due for his next dose was Sunday at 2:00 p.m. exactly 48 hours later he woke up from a nap with a splitting migraine.

I had to call 911 last night because of that migraine that had him in so much pain he was puking for 8hrs straight, couldn't sleep, and then his throat started bleeding from the bile.... he had to get an IV bag and IV Zofran and he's in a whirlwind of recovery today. He's never touching that medication again.

We have been together for a dozen years and I've never seen him so sick or been so scared for him."
Has anyone successfully gotten off Qelbree without a migraine?,"I stopped it cold turkey and didn‚Äôt have a migraine, or any side effects that I can recall. I was doing some medication changes so it was hard to decipher. When I was on it, I took Tizanidine which had a terrible interaction and caused me to have extremely low blood pressure for almost 24 hours."
Has anyone successfully gotten off Qelbree without a migraine?,I did a taper off with no headaches.
Has anyone successfully gotten off Qelbree without a migraine?,I took it for 3 months and stopped cold Turkey about 10 days ago. No side effects that I noticed.
Has anyone successfully gotten off Qelbree without a migraine?,Can you explain your taper?
 how do I prepare for initial side effects?,I‚Äôm not tired at all personally. I‚Äôm experiencing pretty bad insomnia but during the day I feel fucking great. I‚Äôm still on the 200mg dose and may switch to a day time take instead of nighttime when I go to 400mg. Going to text my psych about it tomorrow to discuss. No headaches for me tho.
 how do I prepare for initial side effects?,"I haven't really experienced migranes or nausea on Qelbree. I've only been on it for 3 weeks, but I mostly have irritability, constipation, and occasionally depressive moods. I had a little mid-day sleepiness for the first 1.5 weeks, but now I feel pretty awake. I'm still not feeling any improvement in my ADHD. Sadly, it feels even harder to get things done. You won't really know what side effects you get until you start, so just give it a go, and adjust as things pop up."
 how do I prepare for initial side effects?,I'm on week one of 100 mg and I have no side effects or benefits yet. I take it in the evening just in case it makes me tired.
 how do I prepare for initial side effects?,"I'm a year in and Qelbree really does help me. My experience was that insomnia was a problem when I took it at night before bed. That mostly went away when I switched to mornings. I did use melatonin for a few weeks to help me get into a better sleep cycle. (And also, for me, caffeine became more potent after Qelbree. Now I have half what I used to and none after lunch.)

Overall for me, startup wasn't terrible, but I did specifically make some time at the end of most days to think/journal about how it was going. After a dozen of those across the first month, I stopped. It just helped me see the big picture after I was truly ""on"" my full dose."
 how do I prepare for initial side effects?,"I didn‚Äôt get the migraines unless I missed a dose, and since it took like 2 days I never made the connection until after I came off them.  I‚Äôd set yourself an alarm for the same time every day that way you don‚Äôt forget"
 how do I prepare for initial side effects?,I would first advise you to contact your prescriber and start at a lower dose. This medication is meant to be gradually increased and tapered up. I can‚Äôt believe how many prescribers seem to be unaware of this basic fact..
 how do I prepare for initial side effects?,Switched to day time and now take 400mg. Amazing difference.
Anyone else get a rash? ,Have you tried if possible to do 100 and see if it gets better ?
Anyone else get a rash? ,I broke out in hives a few weeks ago but the only difference was that I was took the capsule instead of opening it and eating it in applesauce which is what I‚Äôve been doing but I just forgot my applesauce that day and I broke out really bad. Not sure if it was that by my psych just made a note of it just in case but I‚Äôm on 300mg now.
Anyone else get a rash? ,I only have 200mg capsules. I called my psych today and hopefully will get a callback tomorrow with some suggestions.
Anyone else get a rash? ,"Interesting. Im hoping that this is just an immune response that will stop after longer exposure.  
Side note, do the medication effects feel different taking it that way?"
Anyone else get a rash? ,"I‚Äôll def keep an eye out, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve noticed a rash, but I‚Äôm barely bumping up to 200 since when I was supposed too I had a bad reaction (side effects)"
Anyone else get a rash? ,"After reading ALOT of posts before taking it, some people said it may help lessen the side effects so really I‚Äôve been taking it with applesauce since day1 and I haven‚Äôt really experienced many side effects besides tiredness maybe an hour after taking it but it was more noticeable once I got bumped up to 300mg. And not being able to sleep if I drank anything with caffeine but im just caffeine sensitive. I started at 200mg for a month before I went up to 300mg. This is my second month taking quelbree but first month done on 300mg. But I don‚Äôt have any side effects anymore or at least for me to notice"
Anyone else get a rash? ,It‚Äôs isolated to my right wrist and low forearm. It‚Äôs so weird.
Anyone else get a rash? ,"I‚Äôm back to say the rash did resolve it self after a few more days, but all the spots scarred. üò´ I‚Äôm still supposed to increases doses and been avoiding it lol"
Normal to feel anxious when going up in dose? ,"30(m) here, started on 200 - 2 weeks, then jumped to 400 where I've stayed for over 4 months. I do not reccomend titrating up that fast, I definitely experienced the anxiety, fatigue, constipation (I'd reccomend fiber if you aren't already!), and brain zaps the first week or so. If you haven't cut your caffeine intake, that could also be attributing to your anxiety as qelbree prevents your body from processing the caffeine, causing it to build up in your system which has lots of unpleasant side effects. 

For me, personally, the qelbree has squashed my anxiety and helped greatly with depression, though I think it got a little worse before it got better. I'm on month 4 now and I'm seeing some improvements, mainly around adhd induced anxieties, but overall I'd say it's been helpful. I'd say give it at least 2 months before you quit (unless it becomes unbearable, I definitely had those days when I started, but was lucky enough to not be very busy so I had plenty of time to sleep through it.)"
Normal to feel anxious when going up in dose? ,"Sorry to hear about the anxiety. My dr also prescribed me Buspar, an anti anxiety med that unlike Qelbree I had no side effects with and helps take the edge off. Might be worth contacting your dr and asking if they recommend something to supplement for the anxiety even if it‚Äôs just during the adjustment period."
Normal to feel anxious when going up in dose? ,"Went from 200 to 400. The jump in dosage made me feel overstimulated in terms of auditory and visual processing. It took a little bit of meditation to focus in on those senses to dial it down. This upped my anxiety ultimately but took a little while to adjust to. Also a med patient smoking thc to help master the senses and adjust to this new baseline. 

Also on Sertraline 50mg. This aids my anxiety but numbs my emotions slightly. Wicked combo using Sertraline+THC though, a lot to take in."
Normal to feel anxious when going up in dose? ,"Shoot I love coffee so much, is it physically harmful to be consuming it on Q? I have noticed that when I drink coffee it almost has the opposite effect than intended which is wild."
Normal to feel anxious when going up in dose? ,"Physically harmful? Probably not, unless you're slamming espresso constantly. But the buildup of caffeine in your system is gonna make you feel like shit, tachycardic, sweaty palms, insomnia, irritability, sleepiness, etc. It's best to bite the bullet if you're gonna stay on qelbree and try to cut (or at least limit) your caffeine intake. I stopped drinking coffee last year, unrelated to qelbree, and switched to green tea which I still drink on Q (but only 1-3 cups per day, brewed light) and I can actually feel the ""calm energy"" people talk about from green tea."
15 yr old son on qelbree,"Qelbree is not a drug he should go off and on again.  Even a few days off of it can result it debilitating migraines.  So hopefully he‚Äôs been ok.  

It is not for everyone, certainly.  I concur, talking with your dr is the best idea."
15 yr old son on qelbree,"You can‚Äôt stop and start it. It has to build up in your system. Sleep issues are normal, especially for the first few months . My son is 14 and on it. When you take it makes a difference. He started taking it before bed and had issues falling asleep at night. We switched to the AM and he started to crash around 1pm. We switched to right after dinner and they made all the difference. Now, he‚Äôs been on it for about 9 months and can take it anywhere from after dinner to bedtime and he is fine."
15 yr old son on qelbree,"Sleep issues are some of the most common side effects of Q - both afternoon exhaustion and middle is the night insomnia. We noticed an improvement of the side effects for our son (then 12) at about the 12 weeks. They persisted, however, for another 12 weeks 

We powered through it and they're much better now (not gone, but mostly). That's not for everyone. I wish you luck finding something that works."
15 yr old son on qelbree,"I just had to call 911 last night because my husband stopped taking it and had a migraine that had him in so much pain he was puking for 8hrs straight, couldn't sleep, and then his throat started bleeding from the bile.... he had to get an IV bag and IV Zofran and he's in a whirlwind of recovery today. He's never touching that medication again.

We have been together for a dozen years and I've never seen him so sick or been so scared for him."
15 yr old son on qelbree,Also it was an ACCIDENT. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve all accidentally forgotten to take a med.
15 yr old son on qelbree,He was fine. He‚Äôs on the lowest dose.
15 yr old son on qelbree,We are not stopping and starting on purpose. I accidentally skipped a few days last week. He‚Äôs been on it 8 weeks. He takes it at night before bed but is a ZOMBIE all day and falls asleep right after school every day. This isn‚Äôt normal. He‚Äôs on the lowest dose. I called the pediatrician today so we can properly take him off this drug. A 15 yr old boy should not be this out of it acting. He went from being an energetic normal teen to sleeping unless he‚Äôs at school.
15 yr old son on qelbree,Yea. No worries. Mostly just concerned about your son! We ADHD folk should never look sideways at someone accidentally skipping meds! (Talk  about the pot calling the kettle)
15 yr old son on qelbree,"Again, the timing he takes it matters greatly and everyone reacts differently. Sleep issues are common with these non stimulants. Maybe he should take it at another time of day. This happened on the lowest dose for my son as well. Also, I would find a psychiatrist to prescribe ADHD meds instead of a pediatrician. While they can prescribe this stuff, it‚Äôs not their specialty."
15 yr old son on qelbree,I spoke to the pediatrician today and she wants us to take him off of it. She told us how to do it. We do have an appointment with A specialist who deals with ADHD next week so I‚Äôm just going to wait for that.
"Been at 400mg Qelbree for 3 months, is that all it is supposed to do","Your ADHD symptoms may not be caused by low norepinephrine, it‚Äôs not been found conclusively in everyone with ADHD.

I‚Äôve been on Qelbree 200 mg for a month and it‚Äôs made a hell of a subtle difference, everything feels more in control and I‚Äôm less of a victim of my inattentiveness. I even remember to start the dryer after cleaning the lint trap (big win). Stimulants will always pack a bigger punch than Qelbree or Strattera though."
"Been at 400mg Qelbree for 3 months, is that all it is supposed to do","norepinepherine helps focus, but only once a task is initiated. dopamine on the other hand is what makes us able to ""sit with ourselves"" and also to gain motivation to do low-reward tasks. i am no doctor nor am i a scientist, but anyone who doubts dopamine plays a role in ADHD is wrong imo. also, idk why so many folks on this sub ask about combining stimulants and non-stimulants. stimulants cover all the bases. i would argue the only way to feel the effects of qelbree is to completely go off stimulants and *then* start qelbree. as someone who no longer takes stimulants i can tell you this medication does help substantially if stimulants aren't in the cards for you.

also straterra just does nothing put make peeing feel weird. total shit of a drug. qelbree at least helps focus once a task is initiated."
"Been at 400mg Qelbree for 3 months, is that all it is supposed to do","I haven't tried Straterra, but I've now been on Qelbree over 4 months. I thought it was working well in the beginning, but then it settled down and the only benefit I was feeling was calmness/reduced anxiety and quiet mind. Lucky for me I had wanted to try a non stim because of the crash I got from Ritalin and because of anxiety and Qelbree helps with both those things so I added Ritalin back and I'm liking the combination right now."
"Been at 400mg Qelbree for 3 months, is that all it is supposed to do","Stimulants are really good at triggering dopamine and breaking out of task paralysis, helping with motivation.  While it is helpful with focus, it often doesn't give the boost to focus that's needed without getting into higher doses which, which often cause side bad effects, a key one being dehydration which leads to brain fog.  This is why water and protein are so important while on a stimulants.

Adding a nonstimulant allows for a lower dosage of stimulant in hopes of being a better overall treatment for those who are sensitive to stimulants or need more help with focus."
"Been at 400mg Qelbree for 3 months, is that all it is supposed to do","I was on straterra for a while and I will say the focus was always nice, but you are constantly needing to run around and do something or you feel weird. Constantly having anxious energy. I stopped taking it because it gave me anxiety attacks, and I am now on Qelbree day 5. So far haven‚Äôt been able to focus much yet, the straterra was better at focusing so far."
"Been at 400mg Qelbree for 3 months, is that all it is supposed to do",Qelbree is weird man. Had more significant side effects than any med I‚Äôve ever taken. The more it went in the more my adhd got worse.
"Been at 400mg Qelbree for 3 months, is that all it is supposed to do",I wouldnt be surprised if my major issue is low dopamine as i am very hyperactive and get adrenaline rushes all the time.
"Been at 400mg Qelbree for 3 months, is that all it is supposed to do","I‚Äôve been on qelbree for 4 months, and I still don‚Äôt feel a difference. If anything it‚Äôs worsened my mental heath and irritability. I would snap over the smallest of things. Something I have never done before on my previous medication which was Adderall. The insomnia doesn‚Äôt go away which attributes to the mood swings. This medication isn‚Äôt for everyone."
"Been at 400mg Qelbree for 3 months, is that all it is supposed to do","I'm on my Vyvanse 50 mg. It works great on days I work, fair on my days off at home, but terrible on days when I run errands and sometimes even driving. There is just too much going on. I didn't want to up my dose any more so my Dr add Quelbree. I'm only on my first week but hoping it helps. Maybe adding stims and non stims is the new thing now. He told me it's 24 hours so I won't ""feel"" anything but hopefully I should notice a difference in a few weeks. Fingers crossed."
"Been at 400mg Qelbree for 3 months, is that all it is supposed to do",i never made the claim that it is for everyone. i am speaking to a person who said they have not had any negative side effects.
"Been at 400mg Qelbree for 3 months, is that all it is supposed to do","yea i always hated after hours on vyvanse it is like you have useful hours and useless hours. i was on stims from age 10 to 31 and i give them 100% credit for getting me through the school years and early on in my career, but unfortunately i abused them among other stims starting in college and that got progressively worse until four months ago when i decided to clean my act up. i think you just have to have the right expectations. qelbree is never going to match stimulants in effectiveness."
"Been at 400mg Qelbree for 3 months, is that all it is supposed to do",Yeah one week in and I don't notice a difference at all. Congrats on breaking your stim cycle! It's tough when it is a med for a condition that you legitimately have. I had a friend with juvenile arthritis who got hooked on opioids and was never able to break free.
Advice on switching from Qelbree 200mg to Strattera? ,"I am experiencing the insurance issues with Qelbree. I am so upset and angry! I tried other medications before Qelbree to no avail. I went through all the things with Qelbree. The nausea, vomiting, extreme fatigue, sleep issues because I was told to ‚Äòhang in there and stick it out‚Äô because it‚Äôs a good medicine. 
I finally got adjusted to 400mg and bamn insurance stopped. I had 3 Rx‚Äôs filled, this was my 4th. My insurance company never notified me and of course I was out. The insurance company wanted me to pay $652 for a 30 day supply. I was livid. After many phone calls, failed attempt at using the Qelbree coupon(my insurance denied it),and tears, I paid $152 for a 7 day supply. It‚Äôs insane to me that an insurance company has the power to decide my specific needs. INSANE! With zero notice. Another bullshit pharma move. 
No generic, you‚Äôre approved by insurance until you noticeably feel better, it‚Äôs a must take daily medication, and coming off of it is not easy. 

I‚Äôm weaning myself off of Qelbree. I went to 200 for a couple of days and now I am 5 days into 100mg. 

Tomorrow I meet with my psychiatrist-Telehealth- who I don‚Äôt think really gives a crap. It‚Äôs the same standard questions every time, followed by a dosage adjustment and see you next time. 
I‚Äôm going to tell her I‚Äôm done with all this BS. I‚Äôve been working on my ADHD journey for many months. All this time, money, physical and mental toll to get to a point where I felt good! To be shot down by insurance and play games. 

Sorry that was a lot lol! It‚Äôs still fresh. Good luck üòä"
Advice on switching from Qelbree 200mg to Strattera? ,"Just reduce the doses as best you can for at least several days.  Talk to your doctor. Have REAL pain killers on hand, just to be safe."
Advice on switching from Qelbree 200mg to Strattera? ,"When I first started taking it I needed to taper off while I waited for the prior auth to come through. I split the last pill in the sample box in half by pouring 50% of it out on some applesauce and taking that, then took the other half by pill the next day and that was it. I didn't have any bad withdrawal effects, but I only got to 200mg and that's just my experience.

My insurance ended up approving my prior auth even though Ritalin was the only drug I had ever tried. Might be worth trying even if you haven't tried Straterra if you haven't already."
Advice on switching from Qelbree 200mg to Strattera? ,"This exact thing just happened to me, make sure you ween off it carefully. The comedown headache was unlike anything I‚Äôve ever experienced, excedrin helped a ton. 

I‚Äôm definitely not getting back on it. The mental clarity was incredible but I just can‚Äôt be on a medication that will put me down if I miss a dose"
Advice on switching from Qelbree 200mg to Strattera? ,That‚Äôs so disappointing that your doctor isn‚Äôt being very helpful. Did they tell you anything?
Advice on switching from Qelbree 200mg to Strattera? ,"I‚Äôm so sorry, that‚Äôs just an awful experience üôÅ Insurance shouldn‚Äôt be able to deny coverage unless a generic version is available! Otherwise what do we pay them for?

I also tried to go without insurance and the cost was between $1k-$200, I spoke to my insurance several times BEFORE starting Qelbree and no one mentioned I would have to try Strattera first. It‚Äôs so hard to get good care, it seems like. It‚Äôs just one patient to the next.

I hope your journey takes a turn for the better ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Advice on switching from Qelbree 200mg to Strattera? ,"Thank you, my doctor is being super unhelpful with how to transition. So bad that I‚Äôm looking for a new one."
Advice on switching from Qelbree 200mg to Strattera? ,"I might try splitting my pills in half as well! Unfortunately, my prior authorization was denied and my doctor decided to give me Strattera (like he should have in the first place) instead of appealing. 

My insurance requires that proof that A) I can‚Äôt swallow pills or B) I can‚Äôt tolerate Strattera."
Advice on switching from Qelbree 200mg to Strattera? ,That‚Äôs what has me scared out of my mind. My doctor is either unconcerned or unaware of the side effects of suddenly coming off. When all of this could have been avoided by giving me Strattera first.
Advice on switching from Qelbree 200mg to Strattera? ,"Not really, just that he was prescribing Strattera. When I asked if he had any instructions on how to transition, he said ‚Äúnot really‚Äù. Which scares the heck out of me based on what I‚Äôve read about side effects üòî"
Advice on switching from Qelbree 200mg to Strattera? ,"Man, my doctors office sounded like they‚Äôd never heard of the headaches. We‚Äôre looking into Qelbree‚Äôs investment background and low key it‚Äôs pretty sketchy. Lots of Blackrock and Vanguard‚Ä¶ 

Anywho, definitely get some excedrin, get water access and maybe prep to take a day off work. I watched one of those ‚Äúmigraine relief‚Äù YouTube videos with headphones and honestly it gave me something else to focus on."
Advice on switching from Qelbree 200mg to Strattera? ,"Oh lord, okay. Thank you for that. I have an appointment with a psychiatrist on Wednesday who can hopefully help some more too üòî"
"Teenage daughter, possible Mania?","Hey! I can offer perspective from a 20 year old who was VERY similar when I was her age. Wild hormones and dramatic & over-the-top reactions to things are super common in teen years. It becomes problematic when it starts interfering with daily functioning (school, her friendships, sleep schedule, physical energy levels, eating, etc) for extended periods of time. If this is the case, my #1 recommendation is to get her a good physiatrist & therapist. The psych NP you‚Äôre seeing is likely trying their best, & may or may not be the right fit, just pay attention to those details. I‚Äôd also highly recommend starting therapy for yourself as well, dealing with a kid‚Äôs mental health issues can really take a toll and you deserve support too. I won‚Äôt lie to you, finding the right providers and meds is a lengthy and exhaustive process, listen to your daughter‚Äôs concerns & if she truly feels something isn‚Äôt right try something different. Take this with a grain of salt because there‚Äôs a chance your daughter is just facing normal teenage outbursts. Even if she isn‚Äôt everyone has very different journeys with adolescent mental health struggles, this is just my experience. You‚Äôre doing an amazing job recognizing these things and caring for your daughter, be proud of yourself for that & if you have any more questions feel free to ask."
"4 weeks in. I‚Äôm done, and here‚Äôs how I‚Äôm titrating down",How has it been going? I also need to get off qelbree
"4 weeks in. I‚Äôm done, and here‚Äôs how I‚Äôm titrating down",Just chiming in with the other commenter to see how it's going.
"4 weeks in. I‚Äôm done, and here‚Äôs how I‚Äôm titrating down",I just cold turkeyed at 3.5 weeks. Felt better honestly since the med was making me feel so god awful. Never noticed much withdrawal.
"4 weeks in. I‚Äôm done, and here‚Äôs how I‚Äôm titrating down","It went ok for me! I still had some headaches for the first day or so that I was off the medication. 

I‚Äôll make an edit to my post."
"4 weeks in. I‚Äôm done, and here‚Äôs how I‚Äôm titrating down",I made it through! Had some headaches on Tuesday that I was able to get through with some ibuprofen
"4 weeks in. I‚Äôm done, and here‚Äôs how I‚Äôm titrating down",Thanks for the response!! Glad to hear that it went okay :)
Anyone prescribed Qelbree and Ritalin together?,"Yes, I take 300mg of Qelbree and 5mg of Ritalin 2-3 times a day as needed. Compared to taking Ritalin without Qelbree, I think it helps lessen the crash or helps the effect last longer."
Anyone prescribed Qelbree and Ritalin together?,My son is on 300 mg of qelbree and then Ritalin 5mg 2 or 3 times a day. We just added the Ritalin and so far so good
Anyone prescribed Qelbree and Ritalin together?,"I'm similar. 200mg Qelbree, 10mg of Ritalin 2-3 times per day. I agree Qelbree helps with the crash. I was ready to quit stimulants because I was so cranky and hungry at the end of the day, but Qelbree helped. Qelbree on its own wasn't enough though, still needed the stim."
Interaction with mushrooms?,Yeah i wouldn‚Äôt do this
Interaction with mushrooms?,"don't take this as any sort of advice, but I looked into this.   There's no experience reports I could find.

Since psilocybin in part acts on nor-epinephrine, I suspect there would be an amplification of either or both drug.   So both at the same time would probably be bad time - high anxiety, high heart rate and blood pressure.    But I also suspect if one stopped the Q for a couple days and let it wash out, it might be ok.  <--  Not advice, just speculation"
Interaction with mushrooms?,"Allow the medicine time enough to get established in your body chemistry before adding something else like psilocybin. I don‚Äôt see anything bad happening to you in my opinion. I have  experience with micro dosing psilocybin. Just start at a low enough dose that you‚Äôre not in danger of seratonin syndrome. Be smart, precise, persistent, and methodical and you will be fine.. also talk to your doctor.. they‚Äôre all about microdosing!!"
Interaction with mushrooms?,Only thing I‚Äôve found on reddit so far is that you might need a higher dose
"Day 2, awful symptoms. ",Damn i started at 100mg then went up to 200mg i think maybe that was just too much for ur body at once
"Day 2, awful symptoms. ","I had to start at 50mg and go up by 50 once a week.    Sounds like a high starting dose.

Doctors don't know how to prescribe this stuff"
"Day 2, awful symptoms. ","Literally took my first dose yesterday and had the same‚Äî headache and nausea, I woke up 12 separate times last night (my watch tracked it although it was definitely more than 12) - still nauseated today. 

Personally, I‚Äôm refusing to continue it. I tried Strattera over 12 years ago and felt the same even after a few months, so I was moved to adderall which has worked great for me ever since. My new doc wanted me to add in Qelbree but I‚Äôm telling her to go F herself after this"
"Day 2, awful symptoms. ",yes. it sucks... but it does get better.
"Day 2, awful symptoms. ","I would suggest starting at 100mg and working your day up. 

Also, based on personal experience - this might be some evidence of an autonomic disorder like POTS, especially if you have other symptoms like dizziness and increased heart rate upon standing. Some say nearly 50% of people with ADHD have POTS and norepinephrine-reuptake inhibitors like Qelbree will make it worse.

That said, maybe try pairing the meds with electrolytes a couple times a day to see if that helps."
"Day 2, awful symptoms. ",Just started mine yesterday 2x 200mg a day . And ngl i feel numb and hot asf . And my vision feels super bright for some reason.
"Day 2, awful symptoms. ","I was given the big blue capsules, 200mg. I can't split them in half üòï I feel absolutely awful but I don't want to seem like I'm not giving the medicine a chance."
"Day 2, awful symptoms. ","I took my first dose of 100mg last week and it made me super irritable, agitated, and tired. I stopped taking it after day one and my doctor said that was the right move if it impacted me that much after one dose."
"Day 2, awful symptoms. ",I was only on qelbree for like two weeks the side effects were so bad (i experienced all the ones you mentioned too) and it didn‚Äôt give me any benefit. The psych who took me off qelbree was not the same one that prescribed it and her words ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what we give to little boys who can‚Äôt stop punching walls‚Äù. If u want to be on a non-stimulant I did have a lot of success with straterra when I was on it so that may be worth a try but I‚Äôm on adderall now and that‚Äôs worked the best for me so far
"Day 2, awful symptoms. ",Starting at 200mg is way too high it is supposed to be treated up slowly. Starting at the lowest dose and working your way up as high as you need.
"Day 2, awful symptoms. ",Curious how old are you all? I was told to put my young son on Quelbree 200 mg .¬†
"Day 2, awful symptoms. ",Did you have side effects from 50mg?
"Day 2, awful symptoms. ",You can open them up and sprinkle some into some applesauce
"Day 2, awful symptoms. ",Maybe try skipping a day to give your body time to adjust? You could always call your doc and get the prescription changed too and just save your 200mg pills for when you're ready to bump up.
"Day 2, awful symptoms. ",only the first day or two - a tiny bit of anxiety and it was a bit harder to get to sleep.   After that it smoothed out.
Does the sleep ever improve? (plz read i need help),When do you take Qelbree? My son is on it and had some insomnia taking it before bed. We switched it to the AM and the insomnia went away. Then we found out he was crashing at school after lunch. Now he takes it around dinner and all is well
Does the sleep ever improve? (plz read i need help),Do you drink caffeine or take melatonin?
Does the sleep ever improve? (plz read i need help),"first week at 200 mg I had the most detailed and interesting dreams. second week I found it difficult to fall asleep a lot. third week I went up to 400 and 4th week my pharmacy screwed up and I had to withdraw for almost 4 days. that was hell. 

all that being said I am now back at 400 after the withdrawal and I have to say my symptoms are gradually all disappearing. and I am noticing and improvement in my ADHD symptoms. not necessarily what I did on Adderall but I've only been doing this 4 weeks now so."
Does the sleep ever improve? (plz read i need help),Sort of.   But I ended up being given 7.5mg remeron for sleep and it works great.
Does the sleep ever improve? (plz read i need help),"no caffeine and yes melatonin, but again, i am really sick fever and cough wise so that could be a factor right?"
Does the sleep ever improve? (plz read i need help),"That could be a factor, but Qelbree does affect many peoples' sleep cycles as their bodies adjust to the medication. Qelbree affects your body's ability to break down melatonin and caffeine, so I would stop the melatonin use and see how your body adjusts. Full disclosure, my sleep was absolutely awful for 2 weeks, but I'm almost 2 months on Qelbree now and my sleep is more consistent than it was before! Everyone is different though, and it is hard to pin down the cause when you're sick. Take care of yourself, and remember, resting with your eyes closed is better for your body than being up and moving when you can't sleep. I hope you feel better soon!"
Does the sleep ever improve? (plz read i need help),do you sleep a full 8 hours uninterrupted now?

Any of you also take Wellbutrin? What‚Äôs your experience been ,works great they compliment one another. wellbutrin makes you happier while qelbree helps you focus
Any of you also take Wellbutrin? What‚Äôs your experience been ,"I took Wellbutrin and felt emotionally blunted with major depression coming off it. I changed to Qelbree and felt better. The thing with Qebree is that when you are taking it you won't notice an immediate switch like you would when you take stimulants. However, it still works great. Hope this was helpful"
Any of you also take Wellbutrin? What‚Äôs your experience been ,"I take Wellbutrin in combo with Lamictal and added Qelbree last week. I absolutely love Wellbutrin and don‚Äôt mind being on it forever if I can remain functional lol. I‚Äôm one week into Qelbree and I‚Äôm happy with what effects I‚Äôve noticed, aside from the rash I‚Äôve developed on my right wrist."
Any of you also take Wellbutrin? What‚Äôs your experience been ,"Didn't take it with Qelbree, but there's never been a drug that made me feel as happy as Wellbutrin. It didn't do jack for helping me get my shit together, so ultimately I stopped taking it in favor of other drugs that work better for ADHD. But damn if it didn't make me feel good even though my life was in shambles, lol."
Any of you also take Wellbutrin? What‚Äôs your experience been ,Wellbutrin helped my depression and ADHD a lot! I still had some anxiety and irritability so I also take a small dose of Prozac with it. I just started Qelvree and so far have noticed a slight increase in irritability. Hopefully it‚Äôs only temporary.
Any of you also take Wellbutrin? What‚Äôs your experience been ,I've been on Wellbutrin for 1.5 years and it's been great for my mood. Does zero for my ADHD. I've been on Qelbree for almost 2 months (upping dosage during that time) and haven't noticed anything bad with taking both. The jury is still out of qelbree is doing much for my ADHD though.
Any of you also take Wellbutrin? What‚Äôs your experience been ,Hi do you think ur allergic or that‚Äôs normal? I know it‚Äôs diff med but I started Strattera a few days ago and have been itchy
Any of you also take Wellbutrin? What‚Äôs your experience been ,If it‚Äôs an allergy it‚Äôs extremely mild since it‚Äôs only a small amounts of bumps. And They itch sporadically. I called my psych today and hoping to get more info from her tomorrow.
Qelbree + Adderall??,My personal dark opinion is they are getting huge kickbacks from big pharma for prescribing it. I don‚Äôt like it and I don‚Äôt trust it.
Qelbree + Adderall??,"Exactly what I did - the two medicines work brilliantly together. Strattera gave me so many side effects - qelbree seems like a cleaner version of what strattera was trying to do‚Ä¶ 

I‚Äôm also sensitive to meds as well and I plan on staying at the starter qelbree dose. It‚Äôs kinda nice not having to completely rely on the adderall honestly."
Qelbree + Adderall??,"My doctor had me try the two together, and they're ok.   Adderall gives a bit of motivation that the Qelbree lacks.

Try it at half dose of adderall, though.    I found the qelbree potentiates the adderall so it feels twice as strong."
Qelbree + Adderall??,I‚Äôm on 60mg of adderall which I‚Äôve been on for years.  I can take my first dose and go to sleep.  Doc just introduced me to Qelbree Monday & this is my 3rd day on it.  I‚Äôve sensitive to certain mental meds but I‚Äôve had no issue with this aside from some major rage but I can‚Äôt be sure Qelbree is the cause because I‚Äôm also premenopausal & also work with a bunch of idiots that piss me off‚Ä¶.so..
Qelbree + Adderall??,"Kinda the vibe I got, too, honestly‚Äî especially when I asked her about generics for it, she was overly-adamant they do not exist"
Qelbree + Adderall??,"I had to beg my doctor to try qelbree.   And as far as adderall and ""big pharma"", profit margins on generic drugs are fairly slim.  I doubt ""big generic"" is giving kickbacks to anyone.

But at least in california, you can see online every penny any drug maker has given to your doctor.   So far mine has only taken a meal from one company.

One person who was getting kickbacks was a professor of psychiatry who other psychiatrists looked up to - he got $8 million from an antidepressant maker to push a brand name AD that turned out to be worse than generics."
Qelbree + Adderall??,What was the dose you were started at? Mine began me at 200 which seems high
Qelbree + Adderall??,First day on qelbree and hoping to have the same results! I love the clarity adderrall gives me but I hate the appetite suppressing and speedy feeling (sometimes) so I‚Äôm excited to have an alternative when I‚Äôm not working. Plus I can‚Äôt wait to gain the weight I lost from stimulants
Qelbree + Adderall??,"I have ADHD, have taken adderall, and am currently on vyvanse and qelbree and I work in the pharmaceutical industry.  

Qelbree is a new medication. Typically patent protections of any new medication lasts about 20 years.  It's different for each drug, but the absolute minimum time to remain in exclusivity under NCE (New Chemical Exclusivity) is 5 years.  This allows the company to charge for a *premium* to balance the high cost of R&D for the drug.  After that time, other companies are allowed to submit generics for FDA approval.

I can't speak on doctor kickbacks because I work on the manufacturing side, not sales. I WILL say that it's definitely an immoral practice used by many pharmaceutical companies."
Qelbree + Adderall??,They don‚Äôt. That‚Äôs why they make money pushing it and writing those scripts.
Qelbree + Adderall??,Yes. No generic available yet which is why my big money fancy office doc is prescribing it imo. However my doc even told me it was used in Europe for years prior to getting fda approval or approval for treating adhd. It was rebranded as Qelbree. Used to be something else by name to treat something else.
Qelbree + Adderall??,"Yep. 1972 Europe. From Wikipedia 

Viloxazine was first described by 1972[10] and was marketed as an antidepressant in Europe in 1974.[6][11] It was not marketed in the United States at this time.[12] The medication was discontinued in 2002 for commercial reasons.[6][13][14] However, it was repurposed for the treatment of ADHD and was reintroduced, in the United States, in April 2021.[6][15][16] Viloxazine is a non-stimulant medication; it has no known misuse liability and is not a controlled substance.[1]"
Possible side affects?,"Started at 200mg for 2 weeks then 400 for the past 10 days... and of those 10 days each one of them I felt like I had the flu. I can't eat I can't sleep and I'm wondering why I'm putting myself through this. 

it's the weakness that I feel and the nausea that is so debilitating. and I don't feel like doing anything at all let alone concentrate on it."
Possible side affects?,so I dropped down to 200 this morning all is well until late afternoon when I started feeling nauseous and nervous. so I split a capsule open roughly another 100 mg. but it still feels like shit.
Possible side affects?,"I stopped taking it about 3 weeks in because of paranoid delusions. I was convinced someone was waiting to sneak into the house, that my husband was secretly planning to divorce me in 9 months, and that he was having an affair via video calls (on a computer with no camera). For other reasons I won‚Äôt elaborate here, there‚Äôs literally no way that any of these were real. 

So watch out everyone. I also struggled with insomnia for the first time in years while on it."
Possible side affects?,"my legs feel so weak since I've been taking QB. 
my arms too. it's like there's a rolling wave of side effects. initially I was having intense detail dreams and now not at all. I never had a stomach ache but now I do all the time. I hope that everything kind of strays itself out in a couple of weeks because I have noticed some positive things from this drug."
Possible side affects?,"I'm on week two and it's getting better but I'm still not my normal self yet.  I'm still really tired and demotivated.

I saw an improvement after switching to taking it at night with a magnesium supplement. That's causing me to get better sleep. I'm just trying to get through the 6 weeks until I can see my provider next."
Possible side affects?,"Headaches. The migraines that come with skipping a dose accidentally are something else entirely, I will forget one day and wake up the next with a splitting migraine and nausea that causes me to vomit for hours. Does anyone know how to make it stop? I just woke up to another migraine attack but I‚Äôm on a zoom class and don‚Äôt want the puking to start."
Possible side affects?,"I‚Äôm almost exactly the same way. Intense migraine along with nausea, i don‚Äôt feel like doing anything. I don‚Äôt wanna automatically blame the qelbree but im seeing a lot of similarities with others."
Possible side affects?,"I have had an issue with the weak arms/legs. I haven‚Äôt been able to walk my dog, it has been absolutely horrible, and that‚Äôs not even the only side effect"
Possible side affects?,I‚Äôm just confused if we see all this stuff cause people only post the negative effects. I mean it has to help some people right ?
Possible side affects?,I honestly do see where it is helping me. It gives me more stability and control mentally. not too much help with focusing tho. the side affects are just outweighing the benefits personally
200mg was fine 400mg I'm done,"If you quit it, make sure to taper down slowly and have medicine ready. When I stopped qelbree it gave me the mother of all migraines and I was in some of the worst pain and ill for days. The only thing that helped the pain was Ativan and 800mg of Ibuprofen. 

I stopped due to intense disassociation and anxiety after going from 100mg to 200mg. I felt like I wasn't really here, which was freaky. I also don't feel like it helped me with my ADHD much at all.

I wish you all the luck, friend! It's tough out there!"
200mg was fine 400mg I'm done,Go back down to 200 mg! This happened to me! 400 was wayyy too much than my body could handle. The side effects were awful. At 200 mg I am so much better.
200mg was fine 400mg I'm done,This makes me want to to go back on it again. Maybe my dose was too high.
200mg was fine 400mg I'm done,3 days at 200 mg manageable. fatigue in the afternoon and general overall crappiness. I am looking forward to those side effects diminishing and sticking with the 200 mg for the full 6 weeks and then do a reevaluation. I'm so glad to have found this Reddit because I would just be lost without it.
200mg was fine 400mg I'm done,"For those of you with crappy results, what TIME do you take your meds? 

Having been on antidepressants in the past, some worked better taking them PM and others worked better in the AM (sleep disruption/insomnia at night or lethargic/zombie during day) 

QB is a 24 hour XR...so perhaps your body can't metabolize well it if you take it at night.

Got my first script tonight...Will take it tomorrow and see how I do. I also do intermittent fasting. I don't drink coffee or eat until noon. 

Just food for thought. Will update everyone."
200mg was fine 400mg I'm done,What time do you take the pill
200mg was fine 400mg I'm done,How are you doing now? Still on it? My doc had me start at 100mg for a week and then up it 100mg each week after as needed until I noticed positive effects. I think doing it that way prevented me from having too severe of side effects.
200mg was fine 400mg I'm done,you know something is wrong when you feel like you're better without anything at all then QB.
200mg was fine 400mg I'm done,hey thanks for the reply. well I'm going down to 200 because the thought of cold turkey scares the crap out of me. I was much better on 200. it might not have given me everything that I would like to have in the anti-adhd drug but it was better than nothing and not as bad as 400.
200mg was fine 400mg I'm done,"200mg again for the past 3 days. stomach ache, fatigue in the afternoon manageable. so I will proceed at 200 for a while and let's see what happens. good luck to you."
200mg was fine 400mg I'm done,"My cat wakes me up around 5:00 a.m. which is when I take 200 mg. I go back to sleep for about an hour or two, get up and around 1:30 in the afternoon I've been taking the second one. I know that's not the way you're supposed to do it however I'm moving the two times closer together because I don't want to be slammed at 400 mg all at once like I was the first time. I don't know if I'm making any sense. I am noticing a slight improvement in focus and a fewer side effects as in no intense dreams, no upset stomach and fatigue is getting better."
200mg was fine 400mg I'm done,"So I pretty much was overdosed and kept trying to stick with 400 for weeks and it was really bad but after talking to my doctor I went back to 200, also tried 150 and 100. It took a couple weeks at 200 to start feeling the full effects."
200mg was fine 400mg I'm done,at 200 mg I was feeling so positive. because I was finally being interested again in the things that I used to love to do as well as being able to carry them out. I noticed that and I'd like to think that if I stay on it for 6 weeks or 200 that there is more of a benefit. perhaps feeling those things more intensely. what has been your experience?
200mg was fine 400mg I'm done,200mg was good for me and still is and I started mid July. 400 made me want to quit though for sure and even some of the other side effects but now I don‚Äôt have any side effects. It has worked very well for me
Caution with Qelbree and caffeine. Qelbree blocks the enzyme that breaks down caffeine (CYP1A2),I feel like for me Qelbree really REVERSED the effects of caffeine. I‚Äôll drink one cup and I can barely stay awake.
Caution with Qelbree and caffeine. Qelbree blocks the enzyme that breaks down caffeine (CYP1A2),I was awake in the middle of the night until I stopped drinking caffeine.
Caution with Qelbree and caffeine. Qelbree blocks the enzyme that breaks down caffeine (CYP1A2),"For me, Q made me no longer crave or even think about needing caffeine. Which was really surprising because prior to starting Q, I was easily consuming 200-300mg caffeine a day. Now, I maybe have 1 cup of coffee a day, but only because I love frothed milk and need something to drink it with ü§£"
Caution with Qelbree and caffeine. Qelbree blocks the enzyme that breaks down caffeine (CYP1A2),How long have you been on it? It hasn‚Äôt changed caffeine‚Äôs effect on me personally. Oddly I was told that caffeine would be less effective while on Qelbree.
Caution with Qelbree and caffeine. Qelbree blocks the enzyme that breaks down caffeine (CYP1A2),"I slept like shit for a week because I was drinking coffee. I feel so much better now without it that I stopped it, period."
Caution with Qelbree and caffeine. Qelbree blocks the enzyme that breaks down caffeine (CYP1A2),i can drink 300mg and not feel it one single bit on 400mg qelbree. maybe im a freak of nature?
Caution with Qelbree and caffeine. Qelbree blocks the enzyme that breaks down caffeine (CYP1A2),I have not experienced this thankfully! I drink usually between 3-5 cup each morning/afternoon (and now while taking Qelbree) but there has been no change in how the caffeine affects me.
Caution with Qelbree and caffeine. Qelbree blocks the enzyme that breaks down caffeine (CYP1A2),"Personally I have 1-2 cups of coffee the morning/afternoon and maybe a tea or something around 3/4pm randomly some days. I couldn‚Äôt sleep well the first two weeks of starting qelbree but about 6 weeks in now at 200mg I don‚Äôt really feel any difference with caffeine intake before vs after qelbree

Edited for clarity."
Caution with Qelbree and caffeine. Qelbree blocks the enzyme that breaks down caffeine (CYP1A2),"That‚Äôs what my doctor told me would happen, and maybe when I first started, but now it seems to affect me like it always did."
Caution with Qelbree and caffeine. Qelbree blocks the enzyme that breaks down caffeine (CYP1A2),"Same here - everyone mentioned the caffeine issue, but I haven't had any problems. I'm not a coffee drinker, but it's in sodas and other things and I feel like caffeine still just doesn't affect me, same as before lol."
Caution with Qelbree and caffeine. Qelbree blocks the enzyme that breaks down caffeine (CYP1A2),I‚Äôve only been on 200mg for a little less than a month so maybe after another few weeks it‚Äôll revert back to normal

Lack of motivation,"Hi I‚Äôve been on Qelbree for 2 years now. In my experience it does take a while like a month to build up and take affect. Each time I‚Äôve increased my dose it take weeks and weeks to notice a difference. 

I am experiencing lack of motivation lately but have contributed it to my peri-menopause hormones (lack of estrogen) and hadn‚Äôt thought about the medication.

For the most part Q helps me finish things and go the distance to get stuff down, but I do still struggle at work at the desk with all the tasks and have to push myself to organize and strategize to get stuff down. . 

But also, with my adhd before Q I was hyperactive and driven by a motor all the time so I was used to a huge natural push forward to go, be, do and build. So it was chaotic but I was productive. (Maybe not in the right areas or on the right priorities though lol)

The meds calm our minds down.
So I can‚Äôt tell if that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs supposed to work and we have to drum up our own motivation now‚Ä¶. Or if it zaps the motivation?
Like am I supposed to put more effort into trying to make things happen or do things naturally because I‚Äôm medicated?"
Lack of motivation,"did you take stimulants for ADHD before this? the lack of motivation is because this med does not do anything for dopamine, which also makes it completely non-addictive! it is a feature for people who had to drop stims due to addiction. it is frustrating, but as you mentioned, once you start tasks you can complete them, which to me is the most important part of treating ADHD."
Lack of motivation,"I'm almost 4 months in exactly at 400mg. There are days when I'm productive, focused and feel good. Then there are days where all I want to do is lay around and sleep. I'm hoping they will eventually even out, but I am considering asking about a low dose of Vyvanse or something for the days that I'm not motivated and need to be."
Lack of motivation,"This is a shock to me because I was on Vyvanse before and motivation was certainly not an issue. I'm an inattentive type so I wasn't so hyperactive which makes me feel like this side effect is twice as bad as it should be.

I switched because of the federal regulations and hoops you have to jump through. You have to see a provider every 30 days exactly and sometimes it has to be in person, and if you manage to organize and plan that then you get to battle most pharmacies being out of stock. The reality is I was not on medication 1-3 weeks after every month and it was just too intrusive in my personal life."
Lack of motivation,"I was taking Vyvanse before this and am trying qelbree because of how bad the federal regulations and shortages are for stims. It's been far too time consuming and expensive to manage stimulant medication. 

I haven't seen any benefits to finishing tasks yet because of the lack of sleep makes me so tired and demotivated"
Lack of motivation,"Do you think they would be okay with prescribing you both at the same time ? 
I‚Äôm about to start Q but I have my reservations.. was on 70mg vyvanse before.."
Lack of motivation,give qelbree more time. for me the fatigue went away after a couple weeks.
Lack of motivation,"I've read of folks on here who are prescribed both, but from what I've seen it's typically a low dose of Vyvanse. I was on 50mg with a 10mg Adderall booster for afternoons, so I get your pain. My best advice for starting Qelbree would be to go ahead and give up caffeine (green tea has been okay for me,) start taking a fiber supplement (the constipation got extremely bad,) be ready for headaches/nausea/difficulty sleeping (my doc prescribed Zofran for the nausea & it helped) and just be prepared to stick with it for at least 2 months before noticing effects. If you can stick it out through that, Qelbree has helped me quite a bit with task initiation and anxiety/depression related to ADHD, it's just that spark of motivation that I really am lacking hasn't happened with it, so I think it may be time to see if a stimulant could be added.. There are other stimulant options I've read on here, I've heard of Jornay PM (basically Ritalin you take at night, and somehow it helps during the day) as well as provigil, which is modafinil."
Lack of motivation,"Thank you so much for that information.
It is MOST appreciated"
Lack of motivation,"I already take a fiber supplement because I am on 8mg Suboxone twice a day so I‚Äôm familiar with the constipation. But I drink deathwish coffee twice a day, sometimes sipping on it all day long. Would the caffeine have the adverse effect while on Q?"
Lack of motivation,Np!
Lack of motivation,"Yeah, qelbree messes with the enzyme responsible for breaking down caffeine (and melatonin) causing them to build up in your body. All sorts of un-fun side effects, but from my experience, drinking coffee makes me tired and irritable but unable to sleep, heart racing, tremors, etc. not worth it imo. I've been off coffee for a year for other reasons, but green tea doesn't seem to bother me and I supplement with ginko and b vitamins; it's a different kind of energy but green tea has helped with my focus (just the tiniest bit.) If you drink deathwish on Qelbree you'll probably not sleep for a week, I'd advise against it! Just search caffeine in this sub and you'll see"
"3 weeks in, bad nausea?","I am a doctor who works in an ER setting (also take Qelbree). Recently there have been a lot more patients coming in for GI symptoms. Also my kids had a GI bug a week or so ago, so I think there is something going around.

If you were doing ok on Qelbree and the nausea suddenly got worse, it is more likely a GI bug.

Definitely follow up with you doctor if your symptoms don't go away."
"3 weeks in, bad nausea?","My Doc gave me zofran for nausea. I am doing a second attempt at Q, to see if I can manage Nausea better this time. I had the same experience as you my first round (2 yrs ago). Huge nausea after 3rd week of Q. I think the zofran will help me, but let's see!"
Adderall ‚Äî> Strattera ‚Äî> Qelbree,"Everyone is different, but my experience after a week has been the opposite of productive. Vyvanse worked great but I was told it made me a little ""intense"". This is turning me into a couch potato though and I don't feel like I care about anything including work. On qelbree I just want to do the bare minimum of answering emails so I can go take a nap.

If I had more anxiety than ADHD I could see this being good for me. Unfortunately, I only have a little anxiety. Mostly my problems are with executive functioning, prioritizing, planning and finishing tasks."
Adderall ‚Äî> Strattera ‚Äî> Qelbree,"I love this comment. I have been with those three (well, currently Vyvanse but similar) 

Imho, they help with ADHD in very different ways. Last week I felt the qelbree ‚Äúhelp‚Äù me. I read a quarter of a non fiction book I‚Äôve wanted to read because my mind was so still and quiet, it felt effortless. In social situations I sometimes get anxiety. Recently with qelbree I can ‚Äúpause‚Äù before reactively people pleasing like I normally do.  And yes, I‚Äôm on my first month, but it was definitely ‚Ä¶ different. 

Stimulants - for me - like I could have read that same book on adderall, but def not because my mind was tranquil lol"
Adderall ‚Äî> Strattera ‚Äî> Qelbree,"I'm 2 weeks in on 200mg. I'm also on Bupropion 300xl and sertraline 50mg. It feels like my adhd has flared up, my body requires some sort of materialistic stimulation like coffee or nicotine to get the real mental stimulation I need. I liked Adderall but hated the appetite suppressing effects. Qelbree feels like that except the food MUST taste good to finish it."
Adderall ‚Äî> Strattera ‚Äî> Qelbree,"Glad to hear it helps with anxiety, as mine stems from lack of productivity, organization, and finishing tasks as well. Excited to see how it goes, hope it helps ease your anxiety so you can focus on the task in front of you!"
Weekends off Qelbree,"Do you have a reason for wanting to take weekends off? From what I understand Qelbree is a med that builds up in your system to work. You might be fine if you didn‚Äôt get a headache over this weekend, but I don‚Äôt really see the benefit tbh."
Weekends off Qelbree,"You will not experience the intended effects of Qelbree if you don't take it every day. It takes around 6 weeks achieve the long term effects and for you to feel ""normal"". 

When I first took it, I did experience a boost in energy and mood after the first dose, similar to a stimulant. However that effect should wear off quickly.

If you stop and start it, you will probably experience continued side effects. Also, it may be bad for your cardiovascular health."
Weekends off Qelbree,"Qelbree isn't like a stimulant.   you can't take weekends off, the same way you can't take weekends off with antidepressants.  you'll feel withdrawal symptoms"
Weekends off Qelbree,I like to feel like ‚Äúmyself‚Äù on the weekends. It‚Äôs kind of nice to let my brain go zinging all over the place one or two days out of the week LOL
Weekends off Qelbree,Why might that be bad for cardiovascular health?
Weekends off Qelbree,"Unfortunately this isn't really that kind of medication - Adderall wears off at the end of the day and tolerance breaks over the weekend are even encouraged, Qelbree builds up in your system over time to work. You've only been on it again for a week, so I wouldn't look at the one weekend as indicative of how it'll always be as not much has built up in your system.

Fwiw, I started feeling like ""myself"" again about a month in, just less scattered. If you need to feel a bit scattered to feel like yourself, this may not be the right medication for you"
Weekends off Qelbree,"This drug increases norepinephrine levels in your body. One effect of norepinephrine is to constrict your blood vessels, including the ones supplying blood to your heart.

Stimulants do this too, but they have been studied for safety in the ways that they are used. Qelbree has not been studied for safety when frequently stopped and started, so it's safety when used in this way is not know."
