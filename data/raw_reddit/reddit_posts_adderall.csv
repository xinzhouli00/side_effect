Advice on eating habits ,Omg this is crazy that your physician recommended to take without food! It cannot suppress your appetite successfully if there‚Äôs NOTHING in your stomach to last you until your medication wears off
Advice on eating habits ,"Eat before you dose, it‚Äôll help make the crash easier and having the appetite suppressant wear off way less harsh. 

I say before cause I know I‚Äôm not touching food for at least 4 hours after that"
Advice on eating habits ,Have you thought about taking other supplements to help you with your appetite?
Advice on eating habits ,"I have this issue. I was prescribed Adderall partly for my AuDHD and partly for overeating ( I did not know until 2 years ago that I have an actual overeating disorder and I'm autistic!) It really helps my appetite to a point. The bad thing it makes me not want to which not good on the nights I work because I'm hypoglycemic. I have to force myself to eat something or I'll get sick. But it wears off around the time I get home from work and my appetite comes back full force. I don't binge eat like I used to but I still eat way more than I should. I lost 30 pounds without trying when I first started taking it but now if I want to lose weight, I need to work hard on it (my job keeps me so achy and tired all the time. I know it's not an excuse but I need to find my willpower.)"
Advice on eating habits ,"thank you hungry-brain2058 for say this! 

It‚Äôs wild to me that your doctor is saying to take it without food!! 

(31F) down 30 pounds, on for 6 months now, just had to adjust my eating habits (how much and what time) took a couple of months for it to stick but the only difference when it actually did was the meds"
Advice on eating habits ,Are you fr? He prohibited me completely since I take it at 7 am and am awake at 4:44 most days for the gym now.because of this im binging everyday??  Could that be the reason?
Advice on eating habits ,My doctor says I‚Äôm unable to eat as it‚Äôs best I take it without food :(
Advice on eating habits ,"You don‚Äôt have to eat a meal, but your body can‚Äôt sustain physical activity and a calorie deficit. I am overweight as well (19/F) and I completely understand using the appetite suppressant to the fullest extent, however taking it while having yoghurt or a fruit snack. Something teeny with some electrolytes to keep you healthy while doing this. Stay hydrated as well. Stimulants dehydrate you so you need to take in double the amount you were before or more even."
Advice on eating habits ,I learned this by passing out in Dillards üòç
Advice on eating habits ,"Did the dr give you any explanation as to why? Because it‚Äôs standard practice to take it with food. 

I am also curious, if you binge when not on it, could you skip vacation holidays?"
Advice on eating habits ,Have you lost any weight yet with it successfully? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ever going to be able too at this point
Advice on eating habits ,"Well, no. I was recently diagnosed and have only been taking medication for a week."
Advice on eating habits ,Ahh makes sense I‚Äôm on my third week :(
30mg IR Adderall - NC ,What part? I'm always isolated i get 20 mg xr I always run out early because I have to take extra sometimes
30mg IR Adderall - NC ,[ Removed by Reddit ]
Anxiety when 10mg once daily IR wears off?,"Hi! Yes I‚Äôve been taking adderall XR for 3 years now and the come down is awful. I did start with IR but I realized I needed it to last me throughout the day. I also have GAD so that doesn‚Äôt help my anxiety at all. My psychiatrist prescribed guanfacine to take around evening to help with the irritability and anxiety. It makes things so much better for me and I feel calmer and regulated. As for the IR dosage I think it works for 3-5 hours similar to what you‚Äôve described whilst xr lasts 8-12hr I believe. 

I‚Äôve had body aches and dry mouth as well  it‚Äôs usually because I‚Äôm stressed or not hydrated enough. I recommend staying hydrated, having an electrolyte drink and always having gum on you"
Anxiety when 10mg once daily IR wears off?,Peak time is literally 30 minutes after you have take it. 4 hours max and that is being generous - for 10 mg. Works well for maybe 1.5 hours after you have built a tolerance for it. So get whatever you needed to get done to doing and finished in that time. - get 20 mg x2 per day or get the xr 30 mg. Once per day(( should be a better experience for you to get things feeling less anxious. ))
Anxiety when 10mg once daily IR wears off?,"I had this problem when I switched to adderall from concerta. Adderall is more effective for me but Ritalin based drugs don‚Äôt seem to cause any crash. I also have GAD and take Paxil. What I found is that my adderall dose was too high. I have found that a lower dose helps my symptoms plenty and I don‚Äôt crash. I also realized it was time to up my Paxil dose but just a little. Too much Paxil makes me numb and has sexual side effects. 

I also switched to adderall IR so I could control the length of dose better. Many days I have no need for the effects to last so long. I noticed the more I took and the longer I stayed stimulated, the worse the crash was. 

Last, there is another group of stimulants prescribed for ADHD. Ritalin based drugs are not amphetamines and did not seem to have any crash or anxiety for me‚Ä¶ but adderall does seem a bit more effective."
Anyone in Okinawa Japan?,Isn‚Äôt adderall not rxed in Japan?
Anyone in Okinawa Japan?,Pretty sure its illegal in Japan unless you did some paperwork and got approved to import it
BEWARE ,Hey I am really sorry this happened to you I am currently stuck in BFE and needing to make some $ I have 20s with proof of prescription
BEWARE ,Still avail?
Does this look like 30mg?,Nope closer to 10 mg.
Does this look like 30mg?,Use pill identifier online..
Does this look like 30mg?,Are you buying these from the street?
Does this look like 30mg?,Someone jipped you friend
Does this look like 30mg?,A more than half empty capsule looks like to me
Does this look like 30mg?,That‚Äôs like 3mg total not 30mg omg why is it only 1/12 full
Does this look like 30mg?,No  lot is missing
Does this look like 30mg?,Only if somebody emptied out 2/3 of them
Does this look like 30mg?,"Absolutely not. I take 2 of the 20 mg and mine are almost full to the top. My son takes 20 mg adderall and his new refill is like he hasn‚Äôt taken anything at all. He‚Äôs had 3 referrals in one day at school. So I gave him one of my 20 mgs to see if it was his refill and sure as shit mine are working perfect for him. I compared the 2 scrips and look the exact same so I‚Äôm assuming he got a bad batch and I have 0 way of knowing how to go about it. 
But you def need to hit up ur pharmacist and bring the bottle and complain. They need to make it right."
Does this look like 30mg?,I would pull your script out in front of the pharmacist. A tech has to be addicted to them
Does this look like 30mg?,Did the whole bottle look like that? Or just a couple? Those are definitely emptied out
Does this look like 30mg?,Wow  someone obviously emptied some of the pills  !!!
Does this look like 30mg?,No. These are actually prescription. Pharmacy.
Does this look like 30mg?,My thoughts exactly
Does this look like 30mg?,Whole bottle. For those interested these came out of the pharmacy at that big box store where they check your receipt at the door.
Does this look like 30mg?,Wow  they r not looking good
Shortage,Controlled manipulation of the markets?
Shortage,there's shortage everywhere for addy cause it's much easier to get
Shortage,Yea it‚Äôs happening everywhere! Luckily I use a mom and pops pharmacy and only once were they out because they make kid scripts their priority
Shortage,Wild out there! üòÇ
Increase in energy?? Specifically for XR. I am desperate. ,"I‚Äôm new to adderall, just got my Rx for ADHD a bit over a week ago.

My experience with XR so far is that when I take it it feels more or less like the IR, and then around 4 hours later as it started to fade I fell another ‚Äúup‚Äù from it.

I have read that XR is composed of half beads that release more or less right away and half beads that release after about 4 hours. I have felt that there was another bump in effects in the middle, but what I‚Äôve read says it‚Äôs just two release times.

It seems to me that one could do their own custom tailored dosing with IR, like if your baseline dose is 10mg you could take 10mg in the morning then 3 or 3.5 hours later take 5mg, and then after another hour take the other 5mg. But I haven‚Äôt tried this and would definitely suggest running it by your prescribing psychiatrist first."
Increase in energy?? Specifically for XR. I am desperate. ,I dunno... sometimes I can fall right to sleep on my 30 mg XR‚Äôs.... other times I can‚Äôt get to sleep when it‚Äôs time to. have yet to figure this out..
Increase in energy?? Specifically for XR. I am desperate. ,"You get the ""zoomies"" for the first 10 minutes or so then it mellows out. I usually do some house cleaning until it passes."
Sleeping heart rate? ,"For me, I switched from xr to ir. Xr kept me stimulated too long. I had trouble sleeping. I would also look at your dosage. I started taking less and less IR until I found a sweet spot.  I get symptom relief but not overstimulation. Sometimes I do take more IR after a couple hours but I don‚Äôt wait as long as XR does to release. Last tolerance builds and the effects while lessen at your current dose. 

I also take L-theanine in the evening. It does the exact opposite of a stimulant. It calms your CNS. Just don‚Äôt take too much. You will feel like zombie the next day."
Sleeping heart rate? ,"First off, going from a 55-65 heart rate to 75 is completely normal and even expected on Adderal being that it‚Äôs a stimulating drug.  Adderall stimulates the release of neurotransmitters like norepinephrine and dopamine, which can raise heart rate and blood pressure. These effects can persist even during sleep, particularly if the medication was taken later in the day or if your more sensitive to stimulants.

I‚Äôve been on adderal as a kid and just got it prescribed to me again about 2 months ago. I have the same side effects as you. My resting heart rate before was around 75-85 but when I started taking adderal again it was commonly +100 just sitting it felt like my heart is beating too fast. I even went to the ER because I walked into work and used my friends Apple Watch to monitor my heart and it was 140 with no prior exercise, just standing there. Now, although my heart rate can still be high sometimes, it has gotten better and I have been less worried about it. I bought a finger heart rate monitor to keep an eye on it throughout the day. My advice would be to keep taking it as prescribed. Drinking plenty of water throughout the day and eating properly will cause less strain on your cardiovascular system. I almost completely cutout energy drinks from my diet also.  Heart palpitations aren‚Äôt too serious unless they‚Äôre accompanied with shortness of breath, dizziness, chest pain things like that. If your heart rate gets worse or even develops those side effects it would be smart to talk to your doctor to see if you could lower your dosage or switching to a non stimulant medication works better for you. 

Sleeping is also a hard thing. Once I started taking them I couldn‚Äôt fall asleep, for sometimes an entire night. I work nights with a roommate that works days so I take my meds right before work, and when I get off try and go to bed asap. Although I found that rewinding and taking more time for my body to finish breaking down the medication helps a lot. I tried melatonin and it works off and on. I would say try to time when you take your medication more early in the day. If you take XR the drug could be out of your system in 8-12 hours. On the other hand, if you take IR then it could be 4-6 hours. Rewinding, taking away screens before bed and eating before bed all seem to help me.

The best thing you can do is to keep monitoring it and if your body doesn‚Äôt adjust to it over time or if it is still concerning you definitely talk to your doctor to see what the best option going forward is. Wish you luck man!"

Do's and dont's with adderall,It‚Äôs not as addictive for me for whatever reason. I started 6 months ago. You‚Äôll find that when you don‚Äôt have things to do you won‚Äôt even want to take it. Like during the weekends when you want to relax and not work or study like me. I take it in the morning before eating only because I feel it works better for me. Then I take my second dose at 1pm when I feel I‚Äôm getting tired. That‚Äôs on work days. Then I snack on fruits and protein packs. By dinner time I eat a light dinner. And I‚Äôm ready for bed. I do take trazodone for insomnia cause I‚Äôve had that for years. And I sleep like a baby. Mind you everyone is different. But this works for me
Do's and dont's with adderall,Following‚Ä¶.just started the 5 mg XR today after being on the short term for about a month. Took it around 9:30 am this morning & it‚Äôs 4pm and I‚Äôm hyped and jittery AF. Wondering if going back to the short term release would be better or if I should try riding this out.
Do's and dont's with adderall,I‚Äôve been curious too. Initially I was on 5 and 5 IR for two weeks but now I‚Äôve been bumped to 10. I‚Äôm wondering how do you know when you‚Äôve hit the right dose? I had more questions for this sort of thread and now of course I‚Äôve forgotten.
Do's and dont's with adderall,So are you on the short term release?
Do's and dont's with adderall,I just started 30 mg of XR yesterday after being on the short term for the past few months. I had to leave work early today because I was tweaking out 6 hours later and my heart was racing and then I hit a wall.
Do's and dont's with adderall,"5 mg? What is that going to do? No offense better off drinking coffee, 10 mg you need minimum that is far to little for most people big and small with adhd."
Do's and dont's with adderall,"I did better on IR. Because I can control the timing and level of stimulation. Many days, I take 15 mg and the another 7.5 in an hour or two. All I need. Some days I beds a little more."
Do's and dont's with adderall,Wow...anything less than 20mg I can't feel. I've heard the worse the ADHD the more it takes to feel alert.
Do's and dont's with adderall,Yeah I am also wondering when I get thw right dose... can I ask how far apart you space your 10mg and 5 mg ???  My doc is going up 5mg every 2 weeks and its been a struggle. im on 15mg AM and 10mg PM he says 6 hrs later .. even if it's 6pm ..I'm like yo that's crazy ..
Do's and dont's with adderall,Yes
Do's and dont's with adderall,Yikes!  I hope we can both sleep tonight. ü§ûüèª
Do's and dont's with adderall,Is 30mg XR  15mg and then 15 mg 4 hours later or is it 30 and 30 ???
Do's and dont's with adderall,"That‚Äôs like max dose. I‚Äôve experimented with the higher dose and it was not pleasant. This is an amphetamine and the side effects can be very serious. If you‚Äôre feeling a huge crash, maybe even worry or paranoia, you are taking way too much. I‚Äôd be careful. It can really start to mess with you. This is a harsh drug if abused and abuse is possible at high ends of prescribed dose."
Do's and dont's with adderall,I‚Äôve always been hyper sensitive to any kind of stimulants.
Do's and dont's with adderall,"I‚Äôm finding the same. Plus if I want to take the XR, I need to take it super early in the morning so I don‚Äôt peak in the late afternoon. Also, if I take the XR more than 3 days I get super irritable and agitated."
Do's and dont's with adderall,I‚Äôve always been sensitive to any kind of stimulants and also have AFib.
Do's and dont's with adderall,"So mine started me out on 5 in the morning and 5 in the evening for two weeks and told me to report back. I felt like I felt a minor degree of improvement so he upped me to 10@am and 10@pm. He also told me to not take them too late or that would screw up my sleep but then basically let me dictate my own dose schedule. So I usually take my first when I get up, usually around 8 or 9 (lazy, I know, lol) and then try to get the other one in around 1 or 2. I‚Äôve taken it as late as 5 but I try not to. My sleep was already f*cked before so I really am not sure if it affects it and how. But I usually go to bed between midnight and 2. Naps are totally a thing, lol, and they don‚Äôt stop me from napping. I must have been a cat in a past life or something. I could sleep my life away. I try not to. I‚Äôm to stay on this dose for a month and then we check back again. So we shall see. I‚Äôve read adults can have I think up to 40 mg/day for ADHD so I‚Äôm hoping we don‚Äôt stop here cuz I feel like there‚Äôs still more room for improvement. At least I sure hope so üòÖ"
Do's and dont's with adderall,20 mg and 10 mg. I‚Äôve since been told to split them up or take 10 mg of regular later on if needed
Do's and dont's with adderall,Same here both 5 & 10 have literally been life changing for me!!!
Do's and dont's with adderall,"XR gave me super bad crashes like that as well. Agitated, a lot of worrying about nothing, raw mouth‚Ä¶. it‚Äôs horrible. It also happens if I take too much IR or stay stimulated too long‚Ä¶ it was so bad I almost went back to concerta but lowering my dose of IR fixed the issue. I‚Äôve come to the conclusion most adderall problems are simply people taking too much. It seriously becomes a drug to be abused if a person takes too much. Luckily I hate the feeling, so no issue with addiction to adderall for me."
Do's and dont's with adderall,Oh so now you're not on the 30XL any more it sounds like ..
Do's and dont's with adderall,"Agree. Stimulants in general don‚Äôt agree with me, I can‚Äôt take much caffeine and the stuff in decongestants sends my heart racing. I also was diagnosed with AFib, which was (so far) corrected by an ablation last year, so I want to keep my dosage as low as possible."
Do's and dont's with adderall,I once made the mistake of mixing behind the counter allergy meds with adderall. Ouch. Bad idea. The crash was unreal.

Keep in mind, ADHD is like ""mind diabetes"". You must change your lifestyle to conform to your limited attention span. Medication will help with the physical effects but once taken you will need to handle the psychological habits that got you by without it now that you are ""in the clear"". Talk to your doctor specifically about this so you can work out ""personal schedule"" that works for you that you can follow consistently on a daily basis. DO NOT proceed without one it will not end well. This is especially important if you are also on the spectrum."

Low dose finding what work getting so frustrated ,"I live in New York and to be honest the search for a good psych , or NPpsych that will understand that you really have an issue that needs to be assisted by medication , i have been to 3 so far and my 3rd that I found recently gives me what I need , I take 30mg of adderall XR in the morning when I wake up at 8am , take the med , bang out my morning routine and then I get a 20mg IR at 4pm , it‚Äôs called a booster , ask your doctor if he is willing to do it , say you did some research and talked to some people and it works wonders"
Low dose finding what work getting so frustrated ,"I was going to say you may need a higher dose but then you mentioned a crash. For me, the crash comes after feeling stimulated. We are all different but if you are feeling a crash it would seem it‚Äôs doing something? Just be careful. I‚Äôve tried the higher doses and it messes with me. I get a terrible crash on the high dose that is accompanied by excessive worry. I backed my dose down to 15 mg in am followed by 7.5mg a couple hours later. I do well there. If on any given day I may need a little more, I do 15mg followed by 15mg in a couple hours. Anymore than that and I get the awful crash. And it‚Äôs awful. If you‚Äôre getting that terrible crash, the dude is too high. You‚Äôll know if you are."
Low dose finding what work getting so frustrated ,"Do you think that i will come off sounding like I'm med seeking or w.e it's called if I tell my doc that I took 2 of the 15mg together and it really helped me alot... im suppose to be taking them 5 or 6 hours apart...  so I wait as long as I can ( yesterday it was 130pm) and it took them and I felt good. On adderall I feel normal but it does help me get things done... i know on vyvanse It felt stronger to me, it did it's job and I could function for the whole day...although it gave me body anxiety which I hated, or made me feel like a zombie.....although I'm sure ir xould be fixed with some food ect."

I‚Äôve had a cold all week and missed a few doses‚Ä¶,"I caught a massive stomach bug (I work in a pharmacy.... people are gross and share their germs with me...üòÖ) and missed several days...3? 4? Once I was able to keep water and food down, I took my usual dose of 10 mg in the AM.... naturally, from the exhaustion from ralphing and pooping non stop.....I forgot I took that dose and took another. My brain was in 'I'm fast as fuck, boooooiiiii!' mode for a few hours, then promptly crashed. I was so confused when I woke up hours later üò© I messaged my Dr when I realized what happened... he recommended (since my body was she'll in recovery mode) to take 1/2 tablet the next day in the AM, 1/2 tablet in the afternoon.... worked like a peach! 
I hope you're feeling better! There's a lot of really nasty viruses going around, right now!"
I‚Äôve had a cold all week and missed a few doses‚Ä¶,"Powerful stuff. I learned to limit my dose the same way. Too much addy is no good.. can‚Äôt sleep, terrible crash, excessive worry with crash. Sweet spot is a good experience.. too much is almost like a different drug altogether."
Who like adderall in LA and OC cali ,You would make bank off me if I was there

Who like adderall in LA and OC cali ,I like em everywhere!
That time of the month,I have to ask but what part of the country are you in ? I found a private pharmacy when the shortage first happened in 2022 and it‚Äôs never failed me since. Bit more costly but worth it. That‚Äôs such a drive to take but I get it. I‚Äôd do it too no doubt if I had to!
That time of the month,"I definitely feel you. Well not the part about driving 3hrsü§Ø dang, but I started stashing 5-7 each refill of my 20mgs and 10mgs cause of the ‚Äúshortage. Couple weeks ago I call asking about my script, the pharmacist tells me,
‚Äúwe have the name brand in stock but your insurance won‚Äôt cover it so it‚Äôll be 323.29$ you‚Äôd have to pay‚Äù SO YOURE IN STOCK OF THE ‚Äúname brand‚Äù one THAT INSURANCE DOESNT FULLY COVER but out of stock of the one that insurance DOES cover and just because of that, I can‚Äôt get my medication that I need?.. wow 
How fucked up is that? ‚ÄúName brand‚Äù or ‚Äúgeneric‚Äù shit, both do the same thing, people NEED THEM to function.basically said we don‚Äôt have the one your insurance covers but we‚Äôre in stock of the expensive one that you have to pay for.. I WONDER WHY!! 
Smh nobody(well I can‚Äôt ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) can afford to pay 323$ for a Fn medicine that insurance covers. it shouldn‚Äôt matter about the ‚Äúbrand‚Äù it‚Äôs fuckin medication and people NEED it. but good old americas healthcare system & the insurance guidelines or whatever tf it is doesn‚Äôt give a shit they just want money. 
They‚Äôd rather, people go months without a medication just because there out of stock of the ‚Äúgeneric‚Äù but have the ‚Äúname brand‚Äù one and since I can‚Äôt afford it I can‚Äôt get it‚Ä¶‚Ä¶if it‚Äôs something someone needs there should be no different pricing or have it in stock but only gives it if the person pays the expensive ass copay..wtf kind of shit is that"
That time of the month,Sorry just had to vent and let it out really quicküòÖ. getting really frustrated about this ‚Äúshortage‚Äù and looking like it‚Äôs never gonna be back to normal so I‚Äôm just preparing myself for the end..üòÇ
What to avoid?,I‚Äôm still trying to figure this all out myself after 6 months. I have my coffee first thing. Then get ready for work then take my meds before I leave for work. Or the other way around. Lol
What to avoid?,My doc was very clear about no caffeine. She said it was okay if I had a small cup of green tea but at least 4 hours later. Also no vitamin C 4 hours before or after taking. It messes with how you absorb the medicine.
What to avoid?,"Key for me was finding the right dose with my morning coffee. Addy didn‚Äôt work for me until I lowered my dose. A little coffee seems irrelevant. It is possible I lowered my dose due to coffee but coffee does little to stimulate me. Addy is strong stuff for me. But coffee is not, I could drink a pot of coffee and take a nap. Some people jitter from 2 cups. I think it depends."
What to avoid?,Think I‚Äôll talk to my pcp next week and get their take on it
The Adderall sh*ts,1000% accurate. I thought this was a commonly known fact about taking adderall. In fact I am shocked to hear other people do not have this issue lol
The Adderall sh*ts,Same over here. You‚Äôre not alone
The Adderall sh*ts,"I have IBS and didn‚Äôt have this issue ü§î weird. But I had horrific mouth sores, brain zaps, and was shaking like a chihuahua lol. I just switched to Vyvanse though because I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore."
The Adderall sh*ts,I‚Äôm so glad I do not have that issue. But now I‚Äôm just curious if anyone else has this issue.
The Adderall sh*ts,"I used to get this with ‚Äúold‚Äù adderall. However, ever since starting the medication again (within the past 1.5 years or so) I feel the new generic and even name brand adderall xr no longer does this to me (and no longer works as well at treating my ADHD, frustratingly).

Can you share with me if you are on Adderall XR, and if so what the dose is and what the typical manufacturer is that is supplying your meds? It should say the manufacturer next to ‚ÄúMFG‚Äù on your pill bottle - I‚Äôve been trying to determine which generics work for me and which generics are totally bunk due to the shortage over the past year, but getting the medication has been so damn difficult and the efficacy so inconsistent‚Ä¶ thanks!"
The Adderall sh*ts,üòÇüòÇüò≠
The Adderall sh*ts,I love the Adderall shits - thats how i know its working and that i can start my work ü§£
The Adderall sh*ts,Not at all for me. It certainly speeds up the need for a morning duke but nothing explosive. Just a good old fashion morning 2.
The Adderall sh*ts,Everyone asks me if I have constipation like every doctor I‚Äôve gone to has asked me because somebody they know takes it and has constipation where I have never had that I have the exact same experience as you and shit my entire body weight out 30 minutes after I take it
The Adderall sh*ts,"Me too! I also get some other side effects that apparently not a lot of people have and nobody talks about and it‚Äôs kinda impossible to research cause it always takes me to drug abuse websites. 

Like I don‚Äôt abuse my literal prescribed meds, I‚Äôm try trynna see how common these side effects are and if their even side effects of my meds."
The Adderall sh*ts,üôèüèº
The Adderall sh*ts,"Yeah, I‚Äôve been taking D-amphetamine ER 30mg salt combo CP by Rhodes substituted for adderall Xr 30mg capsules. I hope this helps."
The Adderall sh*ts,Curious what your other side effects are‚Ä¶? Because I also have some weird side effects I think‚Ä¶.
The Adderall sh*ts,"Thanks! Yeah I believe that‚Äôs what I used to get in 2022 when I lived in MA - ever since I moved to California I‚Äôve only been able to get Mallinckro & Lannett for generic which have been next to useless - I even paid for $200 brand the past few months which is Shire, but it‚Äôs also proven relatively ineffective, although a little bit better. Safe to say my life has been unraveling a bit‚Ä¶ I am on the same prescription as you, 30 mg xr.

Thanks !"
New to Adderrall,"I‚Äôm experiencing the same thing, I‚Äôm on day 2 as well but 10MG xr.. really only getting headaches and having a hard time sleeping. I will get an hour or two where my body feels relaxed but mentally not much a difference"
New to Adderrall,Totally normal! I‚Äôve been on Adderall for a couple months now and I didn‚Äôt feel much at first on the low doses. Just a little more energy. I‚Äôm on 30mg now and it‚Äôs still not enough for me. It helps a bit for sure but I definitely need more. Talking to my psychiatrist tomorrow actually.
New to Adderrall,Day 3 on 5 mg Adderall xr. Doing the set 2 alarms. Kinda helping. Question- how long does the diarrhea last?
New to Adderrall,Can I jump in here and ask a question lol.. I'm on 15 mg twice a day... I can't figure out when to take the second dose without feeling so crappy... the crash sucks badly.. and 15mg barley does anything.. not even sure if it's working. . Doc said next visit he will possibly add a 5mg in middle of day but he's only increasing it by 5mg every 2 weeks I feel like it's making it hard for me to know if it's working
New to Adderrall,Crush it up and and put it in half a bottle of water then drink it. Don't remove the capsule and let the beads fall out‚Ä¶ crush the whole thing up and drop in it your water then snake it up and drink it. Basically just set your pill down and use a book to apply pressure to it - the goal is not to press to hard because you don't need all of it crushed just enough so you can notice a difference and then other beads and powder will remain it act inside the pill. ( light crushing book technique ) - you will see a milky cloud in your water with little baby aderral beads floating around then ingest them and stop complaining. Jk just that's how I do mine if I want them to work better for a shorter time span. Which I like more.
New to Adderrall,"The less you ""feel"" the Adderall the worse your ADHD"
New to Adderrall,Also day two won‚Äôt tell you much. Give it a few more days ‚ù§Ô∏è
New to Adderrall,"Did you get headaches? Also, I do nicotine pouches and it seems to have increased my cravings for nicotine.. and having a hard time with sleep so far.."
New to Adderrall,Bro I‚Äôm on day 6 and it‚Äôs still a thing lol
New to Adderrall,Best for me is to take one 30 mg XR in am and a 15 mg IR after lunch. They complement each other well at those times and you won't be up all night
New to Adderrall,Ask him to try you on some strength of XR in the morning and IR in the afternoon. I've been on this stuff since 2006 and went through hell (including abusing them) trying to find my therapeutic dose...
New to Adderrall,I didn‚Äôt get any headaches. I vape so I get the nicotine thing. AndI have noticed I‚Äôve been going through vape juice faster than usual. The only way I sleep is when I drink and it‚Äôs absolutely horrible. If I don‚Äôt then I‚Äôm up until 6am. Idk how to fix it. If I did then I‚Äôd tell you of course. So sorry.
New to Adderrall,Ugh. üò©
New to Adderrall,Yes i totally get that... i have a history of addiction but I have been sober for 4 years.. I was diagnosed last Feb. Its taken this long to still not have a dose right. Can I ask though 30mg XL  isn't that gonna be 15mg at first and then it gives you 15 mg later on?? Because 15mg isn't enough for me at one dose....
New to Adderrall,"Tbh I don‚Äôt have a gallbladder, I take meds that can cause stomach issues, and now on Adderrall. I‚Äôm a canon waiting to misfire at all times."
New to Adderrall,My target dose was 30 mg xr in the am and a 15 mg IR (instant) in the afternoon.That‚Äôs the max recommended daily dose split so that you have max potency when you need it and aren‚Äôt up all night.
New to Adderrall,"But what i am trying ro ask is, isn't a 30mg XL... doesn't it give you 15mg at first and then realeses 15 mg later ?? Or no?"
New to Adderrall,No it‚Äôs consistently released
Binge eating,"I have the opposite problem, I don‚Äôt eat enough and dread eating. Adderall made this worse for me and I‚Äôve lost 20lbs so it definitely reduces appetite! I‚Äôm switching to Vyvanse next week and seeing if it works better for me because I‚Äôm also getting really bad mouth sores and I‚Äôm super shaky all the time."
Binge eating,Vyvanse usually suppresses appetite

Anyone else get uncontrollably horny when coming down on Adderall?,I‚Äôve taken Adderall for most of my life. Whenever I‚Äôm coming off of it stay off of it my sex drive is out of this world. It‚Äôs almost crippling but it‚Äôs welcomed at the same time.
Anyone else get uncontrollably horny when coming down on Adderall?,So cool. What swing if you don‚Äôt mind me asking? Is it something that needs to be installed and stuff?
Opinions wanted using Adderall as a sleep aid:,Wow. So you take addy and go to sleep? No way I could sleep after taking addy. I can‚Äôt even take it after lunch or if want to sleep that same evening. I‚Äôve never heard your experience but it‚Äôs interesting.
10 MG IR,Willing to $

Doctor mistake,"As long as the prescription hasn't been filled, yes you can get the new one filled."
Doctor mistake,"Id get a new doctor. She sounds horrible. They are not all horrible. I had to change my last Doc because he was becoming a very grumpy, disgruntled doc. Before I changed docs I discussed his grumpiness with him. He explained being a doc at a big clinic is a horrible job these days. They pack him with appointments, he has no time to really care for patients. He was apologetic and committed to doing better but it didn‚Äôt take long for the grumpiness to return, so I switched. My new doc is awesome."

Help on redosing IR adderall ,Take the second one at noon so it will wash out by 6pm and allow you to go to bed by 10pm.
Help on redosing IR adderall ,"I try splitting my doses on longer days. I take half an IR, 2-3 hours later (before it wears off) the other half. 

I also found that changing my XR and IR dose times helped with this. I take my IR in the morning and my XR as the booster, so my last dose of day is taking longer to wear off and having less of the crash in case it fully wears off before bed (my sleep issues return if Ive completely come down before bed)

We‚Äôre all different though, it‚Äôs just figuring out your body and your experience with the meds. I‚Äôve had to completely adjust my sleeping and eating schedule in order to be able to take my meds when I need them the most, for example."
Help on redosing IR adderall ,Thank you. I prefer earlier sleep because Seroquel can be a beast when it‚Äôs time to get up. I prefer to rise earlier

What am i doing wrong ,Why would one do this vs taking a pill? I assume this is for a certain effect? It sounds like it could be dangerous. Be careful.
What am i doing wrong ,Wut do i use?
What am i doing wrong ,Have you looked up the bioavailability between oral and rectal? The higher bioavailability is oral - you are wasting it.
Teva Adderrall,It night and day from the others. My experience in Florida is only CVS but since the shortage it‚Äôs not consistent.
What stimulants cause the most euphoria? ,"Seriously? It‚Äôs not Adderrall. 
You‚Äôre talking about illegal stimulants? Those are the ones that dump the most dopamine into your brain which is responsible for that feeling of euphoria. It also makes people WANT that feeling again, creating addiction, as in crackhead looking, toothless addiction. 
Exercising actually causes euphoria too, that‚Äôs why people who exercise all the time rarely skip a day."
What stimulants cause the most euphoria? ,No I'm wondering if there's like a generic form that causes more euphoria than others. I should have specified
Pressed adderall Xr,The only problem I have is one it could be opened and messed with without any signs it was messed with
Pressed adderall Xr,People would put water pill beads and sell em so becareful wont hurt u but
Pressed adderall Xr,"I‚Äôve personally never came across a fake XR. But the peach football looking 20 & 30mg addys and the circle ones are being pressed like there Tshirts. I see them everywhere and every one I see is pressed. You can tell by the color, so they definitely would go to pressing a tab first before trying my to figure out how to(I don‚Äôt even know what to call it) lace/switch out ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è the beads that‚Äôs already in there. But if they do you can tell by if the beads break or not. If they break easy af then there fake, the real ones don‚Äôt even crush if you put the beads in a paper and hit them with a hammer. Shits will still be balls"
Pressed adderall Xr,Did you get any and how‚Äôd it turn out?
Pressed adderall Xr,"Whhaaatttttt?????? wtf is even ‚Äúwater pill beads‚Äù?? Are you serious?? I bet that‚Äôs what this one account does, they post pics of addy XR caps but the caps are clear and you can see the beads. I personally never seen that kind, but that‚Äôs crazy af that people do that. Wow
Thank god for pharmacies üòÇ"
Taking adderall while intermittent fasting ,Definitely will help you fast just drink lots of water and some juice. Stay hydrated - and you will be losing weight rapidly.
Yes indeed üòÑü§©,"I use Walgreens too. I get Adderrall IR 20mg as a boost since I take 30mg XR in the morning. 
My 20mg IRs are orange, I have never seen those white ones you have. Who is the manufacturer? I tried a weird manufacturer during the shortage because that‚Äôs all my pharmacy had, and they were horrible. Have those been working for you?"
Yes indeed üòÑü§©,"I never seen these either but been getting from day 1 lol and wayyyy better than the orange IMO. The manufacturer is mallinckrodt, reason the M is on it.

Question ,i wish
Question ,Ya that‚Äôs definitely not the norm lol
Question ,"I get that much. I get 60mg of Adderrall XR daily with two 20 mg Adderrall boosters. I have been taking it for years and my psych has switched up my prescription a few times. 60mg Vyvanse is actually equivalent to 30mg Adderall XR, according to my doc. He‚Äôs had to prescribe me 60mg of Vyvanse daily during the shortage. Vyvanse isn‚Äôt as potent as Adderall XR is but it tends to last longer, so your psych basically sends you what mine sends me. I‚Äôm a fast metabolizer, are you a fast metabolizer as well? 
Your prescriptions appear to be adjusted so that the meds reach a therapeutic level in your body. What is therapeutic for one person won‚Äôt be the same as what is therapeutic for another person. 
I see a neuropsychiatrist and they are the best for ADHD. How about you?"
Question ,How do you sleep?
Dexedrine support similar to oranges for adderall?,"Dexedrine is supposed to be strong, what manufacturer did you get?
Vyvanse is similar to Dexedrine but it is long acting. Vyvanse also tends to work better for most people, there aren‚Äôt as many different brand of generics for it yet so I think the formulation is close to the brand name since generics have only been available for it since last year. 

Not sure l tyrosine would make much of a difference but it can‚Äôt hurt. 

Magnesium glycinate is great to take, also b6, well a good b complex. B complex injections are even better. 

Dexedrine can deplete the dopamine in your brain because it‚Äôs so strong. 

I take supplements and they really help, I tried nootropics but they didn‚Äôt help me. Just don‚Äôt take vitamin C or eat oranges right before or after take Dexedrine, I know it can interfere with the absorption of Adderall, so it might interfere with the absorption of Dexedrine too. 

I‚Äôd switch to Vyvanse if I were you. 

I hope some of this has been helpful. I‚Äôm no expert but I figured I‚Äôd comment since no one else has.

Dexedrine is the oldest stimulant medication that is still prescribed but it isn‚Äôt prescribed that often. It might be the manufacturer of the generic that the pharmacy gave you or it might be that it just doesn‚Äôt work for you. 

My psychiatrist‚Äôs PA thought Dexedrine would be a good option for me during the shortage but my psychiatrist prescribed Vyvanse instead and it worked well for me. He prescribed 60mg of Vyvanse which he said was equivalent to 30mg Adderall XR."
Dexedrine support similar to oranges for adderall?,"What‚Äôs up with magnesium why do people keep suggesting that?

I remember taking it, it ended up cancelling my sleep pattern. Said to take it before bed, end up getting up way too early because of it. So why magnesium?

B6 is ok. Fish oil on a consistent basis puts a wall for any brain fog. So I think fish oil trumps B6.

Tyrosine or theanine can help elevate dopamine or influence it. Just don‚Äôt take them higher than a gram and only sparingly. You‚Äôd end up low and buzzed out if you do, my experience atleast.. or take it if you know you‚Äôre going to get a well rounded nutrition for a whole week.

Nothing jumpstarts anyone I bet yourself as well with adderall. How do you replenish your dopamine if they‚Äôre exhausted? Thanks for replying."
Switching to extended release,"I‚Äôve recently changed from IR to ER 
I‚Äôm on my second month in ER and for me ER works way better. I had a similar experience with ER with Concerta prior to switching to adderal IR and then ER.
My Dr asked to try the IR first and to see if we could manage my symptoms but I found the headaches after medication wore off to be unbearable. With the ER I barely have any side effects and no headaches. ER is a gradual release, I notice when the second portion of the dose is released. I don‚Äôt feel it as intense as IRs even with the doses being the same this could be because of the time release mechanism."
Switching to extended release,"Do you notice the initial effects of the medication since it‚Äôs gradual? 

It‚Äôs such a crazy medication‚Ä¶ when taking IR, I feel the initial effects and it‚Äôs a perfect balance of energy and motivation. I just wonder if you still feel that with ER at all"
Switching to extended release,Yea the medication works the same for me except instead of having to remember/timing  when to take the second dose for an IR vs it being released on its own with ER. I found that this imperfect timing by using IR was the difference between headaches and other side effects vs hardly anything noticeable at all. I‚Äôm sure you can time it right with IR I had a routine going that made it bearable but it had its flaws and the ER for me was more convenient and optimal.

questions for people on adderall and pregnant,"You may want to also ask a few other subs this question who may have more experience and overlap.  Esp the subs that are adhd women specific (or even PMDD or ASD women specific), since that‚Äôs more likely to contain the demographic you‚Äôre looking to connect with. 

As a side note, from what I know about it (as this has been a concern of mine at times in family planning), there are a lot of women who have stayed on their prescriptions during pregnancy and didn‚Äôt seem to have complications (meaning with either their pregnancy or their child‚Äôs development post birth).  There seems to be some variation in some women trying to minimize their dose in the beginning and I believe the concerns are actually greater post birth if you plan to breast freed.  I technically don‚Äôt have experience myself in this arena but again, I think you should ask around in some women‚Äôs forums for better insight."
questions for people on adderall and pregnant,"Stayed on mine the entire pregnancy and worked with it through my doctors. My first kid I weaned off. My second one I knew I couldn't (it was also pandemic) and they were SUPER receptive and said they have had many patients who stay on it, they just want to do some more ultrasounds throughout and check growth and cardiac functions more often to make sure all was going well. Have a healthy 3 year old and many friends who have had to stay on it too during pandemic babies. Talk with your doctor there are not many studies because you can legally tell someone ""here take this"" while potentially harming a fetus, unlike other drug trials."
questions for people on adderall and pregnant,"I got pregnant while on Adderall but stopped taking it once I knew (after 2 weeks) - mine was a geriatric pregnancy, so I stopped taking EVERYTHING and stopped caffeine as well. It was tough. 

I hope you get some help with this - I found it excruciating to be without any meds of any kind (except Tylenol, and then I had a baby with autism and ADHD, so do what you will with that connection).

Definitely consult with your OB/GYN and find out what the current published research says. YOU need to be healthy, too. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π"
questions for people on adderall and pregnant,I was on it for a few years and stopped cold turkey as soon as I found out I was pregnant...I was already so tired and   nauseated it didn't even matter! I didn't notice any withdrawal symptoms.
questions for people on adderall and pregnant,okay thank you! i am new to reddit and i am not sure where to go! :)
questions for people on adderall and pregnant,"If you don‚Äôt mind me asking what was your dose? I too weaned off for my first baby and pregnancy was MISERABLE without it, I‚Äôm so not myself without my meds I hate it. And just found out I‚Äôm pregnant again soooo here we go again lol"
questions for people on adderall and pregnant,"I‚Äôm happy to help. I‚Äôll DM you my list of favorite subs for this sort of overlap, and you can take it from there.  

I also believe there‚Äôs a lot of data being collected on medication impact in women, including in pregnancy and such, by women.org (I may have to double check that to make sure it‚Äôs the site I‚Äôm thinking of), so you could try taking that route as well."
Thinking of quitting ,80 mg seems like a LOT. I would ask your care provider/prescriber about slowly lowering the dosage to see if you don't need it.
Thinking of quitting ,How long is so long? What was your dose when you started and how did it get to 80mgs? How long you been on 80 mgs and how do you take that exactly?
Thinking of quitting ,"Wow, 80 mg is a lot! I would definitely talk to your doctor about a taper to slowly wean yourself down and off. I‚Äôm kinda in the same boat but not taking that much. How old are you?"
Thinking of quitting ,omg!  I cannot imagine.  I get nausea of 20's so I do 2 10's twice a day.  Hoping you find the answers you need.
Thinking of quitting ,I take 90mg and am also scared to quit. I binge eat without it and this causes me more anxiety than anything i think. Hows your journey going?
Anyone selling Adderall IR in Miami, ?
Anyone selling Adderall IR in Miami,Yeh
Any tips?,I understand that bc I had to force myself to only take them on the days I work. At first it was hard but it helps! Also you shouldn‚Äôt be taking more than what your doc prescribes you to take.
Who can access my records?,Doctors have a system that can see all your controlled substances. In Ohio it‚Äôs called OARRS and any doctor you are seen by will look it up‚Ä¶
Who can access my records?,"im a med tech; theres a program called pmp doctors can use to monitor prescriptions, itll pretty much show any script youve gone to get and what pharmacy its from the days dosages quantity etc. Also if they use epic its connects to pharmacy system that shows what meds you take or picked up too"
Who can access my records?,"In case you are still wondering about this. 

Controlled substance prescriptions are required to be kept for 7 years by a pharmacy, but the computer system may keep a long of what you received for years over the required 7 years. 

If someone that has access to the PMP system has the birthdate and name of the patient, they‚Äôll be able to pull up the profile. It will only show 12 months worth of information to that person that has access, but law enforcement can request many many years worth of data. They have to request. 

I know of a few doctor offices where the office staff has access to the database and is supposed to use it for legitimate reasons only. 

There is a way of tracking who accesses what, but I‚Äôm unfamiliar with the process for that."
ED from adderall,I‚Äôve been on adderall for 4 months. I haven‚Äôt had any libido since. I‚Äôm not super angry about it. I am much happier overall so that imo outweighs my lack of libido. My husband understands and I make sure to take care of him often.
ED from adderall,itll come back if u stop taking it for a bit don't worry
ED from adderall,I think it‚Äôs different for men than for women. Women don‚Äôt have to ‚Äútransform‚Äù for sex. But good to see someone validate my experience.

My girlfriend's brother has been phoning saying she sold all his belongings and called the cops saying their 83-year-old mother planted a bomb in his car....,He will end up in an ER as z psych crisis... Either too much Adderall or it the med pushed him into a psychotic episode of it's own..

Each person responds to any  drug in their own unique way. It def is not an Rx to mess with altho ppl certainly do.
I'm getting very sleepy these last 3 days,I get like this sometimes it‚Äôs almost like you get in a lethargic haze but it mainly happens if the pharmacy switches brands
Aghhh,It means it's from epic LLC and they suck. Also have them. Garbage.
So I have a prescription for adderrall and resent back injury I was also prescribed 10mg oxycodone or Percocet How long after taking adderall should I wait to take Percocet,I know you can‚Äôt take them together but how long should I wait back is killing me
So I have a prescription for adderrall and resent back injury I was also prescribed 10mg oxycodone or Percocet How long after taking adderall should I wait to take Percocet,4 to 6 hours . And I‚Äôve done this quite a bit.
Where can I find adderall in Brooklyn?,"I‚Äôm

Coming off Concerta 36mg and onto Adderall 20mg XR. Is the dose too high?,"20 is ""standard"" dose. But start at 10mg. I was prescribed 20mgs to start to but I tried 10mgs one day on my own and it was much better so now I take 10mgs a day. Try to take less if you can you can always work up you have your whole life but less is ideal. But I also use adderall more to be calm and chill out as opposed to getting revved up and getting things done."
Coming off Concerta 36mg and onto Adderall 20mg XR. Is the dose too high?,I switched form Concerta 54mg to Vyvanse 70mg and now locked in with my Adderall XR 30MG and boy I feel slick‚Ä¶ Mc Lovin it‚Äô which both of those are equivalent dosages to the Concerta but Adderall XR lasts 12-14 hours with a far more powerful experience than Methylphenidates. Welcome to the club brothaü§üüèæ
Coming off Concerta 36mg and onto Adderall 20mg XR. Is the dose too high?,"Weight and Age, Health, taking it on empty stomach vs eating, etc. You have to make the benefit of the doubt with Adderall for its maximum performance for the solid 14 hours of being ZAPPED out your ass like myself at this very minute."
Coming off Concerta 36mg and onto Adderall 20mg XR. Is the dose too high?,God I wish !
Dosing effectiveness?,Same as me! Doctors prescribe way too much and most people are over prescribed. I was started on 20mgs as well but found 5mgs is sweet and subtle just right not off the wall. Less is more! Your tolerance will thank you and you can always go up there is no rush.
Dosing effectiveness?,I feel like if you don‚Äôt need it don‚Äôt take it.
Dosing effectiveness?,"Late but, I'd only take what's needed for that day. There are(will be) days you need an extra boost. HOWEVER! Only take what you need FOR THAT DAY lol"
Is late-onset ADHD a thing?,"Hi I‚Äôm not sure your age but I‚Äôve been diagnosed with ADHD and I feel that is was a late diagnosis for me.
I think there are a lot of common characteristics of ADHD but it does look differently in each person. As you said, I also felt like I never really struggled with it in grade school or academics for the most part. But, as I‚Äôve gotten older and tasks have been increasingly harder for me to do, it was undeniable to me which is why I was diagnosed a few months ago. I‚Äôve been done with schooling for a few years now and have been working FT for a while. 

I felt the same that you did and was really scared that getting diagnosed and becoming medicated would derail my career and my life. I will say being diagnosed and being medicated has drastically changed my life for the better. It is so relieving to be able to get my work done and actually feel motivated to start/complete tasks. 

If you do choose to get diagnosed and want to be medicated I will warn you that Adderall is highly regulated by the DEA currently (They call it a shortage but it‚Äôs really not lol). So it is much harder to get at certain pharmacies. There are times when I have to shop around and communicate to my psychiatrist which pharmacy to send my prescription to. It doesn‚Äôt always happen but I just wanted to give you a heads up.

Aside from that, I wish you well in your journey! I hope you find some clarity and find something that works for you."
Is late-onset ADHD a thing?,thank you! do you think you developed it later in life or that you always had it but didn't know?
Is late-onset ADHD a thing?,"Hi, honestly it is hard to say for me. Growing up, I knew kids in my class who were ADHD and they were the type of kids that would be hyperactive and very disobedient. I always thought I could never be ADHD because I wasn‚Äôt like those kids at all. However, I know ADHD typically has multiple classifications: inattentive type, hyperactive/impulsive type or a combo. I feel I identify with the inattentive type the most. As I‚Äôve gotten older, I think it‚Äôs gotten worse. I find myself zoning out, not able to listen to verbal instructions/directions, and trying to do other tasks while someone is talking to me. (Sometimes i feel trapped and restless in certain conversations). It sounds like we have some similarities.  I think you and I may have a mild form of ADHD meaning we were able to manage it fairly well in our lives until certain obligations of adulthood and FT careers. Again, sometimes a professional diagnosis helps just for peace of mind even if you‚Äôre not looking to get medicated. Prior to my diagnosis, I‚Äôve taken many quizzes online from (possibly not that reputable) websites to see my results out of curiosity and they all said I had many traits and characteristics of ADHD."
Adderrall manufactures ‚Äî work differently?,You can research genetic v pharmaceutical drugs. There  is a lot to suggest it is possible.
some circulation bullshit after yesterday‚Äôs moped ride,Do you have Raynauds?  How long have you been taking Adderall?  I am experiencing the same thing all of a sudden.
some circulation bullshit after yesterday‚Äôs moped ride,"It‚Äôs a side effect of taking Adderall. I stopped taking during my pregnancy and for a year after, it went away. When I started back the symptoms came back."
splitting dosages / tolerance build up,"I do split my 30mg IRs. From half, sometimes I'm ""up"" enough for a half day. I've also got the other if the day gets extended as well as a surplus"
splitting dosages / tolerance build up,Everyone builds a tolerance eventually..
Never-Ending Tolerance BS,I take the same amount! I can literally take a nap after taking my meds!
Never-Ending Tolerance BS,"I am taking breaks as well to avoid building tolerance. So far, I am taking on the days I need to be super sharp. Thankfully, my job is very automatic to me. I need to be super sharp 2 a week."
Never-Ending Tolerance BS,"On the first day, drink tons of water and go for a light jog if your body can handle it, luk warm to cold shower to shorten the withdrawal period. I am also on the 30 mg dosage. stay away from excessive coffee. tried to replaced adderral with coffee on my downtime had a massive nose bleed from high blood pressure."
Adderall Tolerance too high!,"Yes, I have been taking two 30mg of IR a day for ten years and it has worked great up until a year ago. My doctor tried to give me a 30mg XR in morning with my 30mg IR in afternoon and that made things worse. Either the adderall ingredients have change for it to less effective or my tolerance level has increased but Honestly believe I need 90mg a day but scared to ask doc since maximum dose is 60mg a day."
Adderall Tolerance too high!,Im on Concerta now. Insurance would not cover 72 mg. Im on 60 mg. 72 mlg was $688. 60 mg is $50 with insurance. I want my adderrall back! $10 with insurance. You feeling the nation wide shortage?
Adderall Tolerance too high!,"So, this was a question I had pondered for a long time. Why is it that Adderall and other drugs for that matter lose effect over time. And, how certain dietary changes can cause profound changes in the therapeutic effect experienced. 

The following study helps explain why a person with ADHD new to Adderall might not feel any effect and a person who has no cognitive issue might have an overwhelming effect. 

In the link below, blood serum pH (acidity or basicness) and the lower the pH the weaker the effect. This is why Tums potentiates Adderall, but if you raised the pH of the entire body the same dose might be hell and cause unpleasant things like tachycardia.

Adderall Tolerance too high!,"My max is two 30mg of generic. There are two generics, I like the oval ones. The round ones dissolve to quickly."
Adderall Tolerance too high!,I asked my doctor and he says my dosage is already high. I actually asked him about 90mg a day but he gave told me what your best guess is.
Adderall Tolerance too high!,"Yes.  The shortage is affecting Tennessee, Georgia and Alabama for sure.  My doc told me about it and saw people trying to get their script filled from out of town this week"
Adderall Tolerance too high!,"So, naturally, my next question is do people with ADHD have lower blood pH?"
Adderall Tolerance too high!,I think the round ones are not teva
Adderall Tolerance too high!,What were his suggestions? I have tried taking 2 weeks break to see if I could lower my tolerance level but it was not effective.
Adderall Tolerance too high!,He just said my dose is already high and he didn‚Äôt want to go higher. I don‚Äôt know anyone who had any higher and as often as me so I can‚Äôt really debate. Thought I might go see an ADHD specialist.
Adderall Tolerance too high!,I have heard of people being prescribed 120mg a day but that was years ago think doctors are scared these days since so many people are abusing it and taking advantage of doctors. Lmk what you figure out‚Ä¶ cause I have tried other type of adhd medications and different brand names and it wasn‚Äôt as effective as adderall teva IR. so idk what else to do but continue to be a zombie lol
Adderall Tolerance too high!,I hate IR. I feel like it‚Äôs just diluted and I have less control of how my dosage is. I will let you know if anything changes.
Adderall Tolerance too high!,In my opinion I feel that way with ER extended release. Like up and down effect one minute I am drowsy next over stimulated. I rather take Instant release and able to titrate my dose through out the day.l.
Adderall Tolerance Too High,"As a narcolepsy patient I cannot relate in any way to this statement.  If I‚Äôm not on Adderrall, then I‚Äôm simply not awake.  This shortage of the drug over the past 3-4 months has been hellish."
Adderall Tolerance Too High,The same here! I‚Äôm looking for some adderall now
