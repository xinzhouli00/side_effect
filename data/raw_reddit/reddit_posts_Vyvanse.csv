How do I cut down elvanse ? ,If you‚Äôre up until 5AM your dose is MUCH too high which is probably why you have so much anxiety too. Just dilute the pill in water and drink half and you‚Äôll do much better.
How do I cut down elvanse ? ,"Check supplements to manage anxiety, l-theanine helps me. I feel much better after I started the supplements"
How do I cut down elvanse ? ,"5am üò≠üò≠ I take 50 and could fall asleep with ease by 9pm... Jesus Christ that must be way too higher dose for you, for it to be acting like that on ur sleep! You're not drinking Caffeine on it are you as you should completely cut that out if you are - but yes put the 50mg in 50ml of water, disolve then take out 10ml for each 10mg"
How do I cut down elvanse ? ,Yes just be careful you don‚Äôt spill the powder mine are filled pretty full and then dump half the capsule in water stir and you can slam it or drink it slow for slower effects. Hope you get your meds all sorted out it‚Äôs so hard finding the sweet spot. Happy holidays
How do I cut down elvanse ? ,i open the capsule and pour what im taking on a spoon and the rest i leave in the capsule and close
How do I cut down elvanse ? ,"I do this every day. Trying to eyeball powder is impossible.

Open the capsule, pour the whole thing into 5oz of water, stir. There will be sediment in the bottom, but it is just filler so don't worry; all the medicine dissolves very quickly in the water.

Now you have liquid elvanse at a dose of 10mg/oz.

I use distilled water and keep it in a sealed container in the fridge until the next day so I can take the rest then."
How do I cut down elvanse ? ,I'm on 60mg a day. But take a 30mg in morning and a 30mg in afternoon works perfect. I'm lucky my insurance pays for the 60 pills a month.
How do I cut down elvanse ? ,"Thanks very much. But on Amfexa I don‚Äôt experience any anxiety at all but on elvanse I do, I just need to be on elvanse  till I can return home to my Amfexa delivery"
How do I cut down elvanse ? ,Also the reason you're getting bad anxiety is coz the dose is either far too high and/or interacting w another stimulant like caffeine x
How do I cut down elvanse ? ,Thanks so much I appreciate it. I just don‚Äôt get why elvanse gives me anxiety and insomnia and racing heart but amfexa doesn‚Äôt; so weird
Will masturbation while on vyvanse make the dopamine baseline to go higher?,Only one way to find out!
Will masturbation while on vyvanse make the dopamine baseline to go higher?,This made me laugh way more than it should have!
worried about double dose (not medical advice!),"Not medical advice, but your body will possibly metabolise it slower than 50. Which may help. 

Just try to stay chill, drink water and take in electrolytes. If you are worried call a pharmacist for advice. Or 999 if you are proper worried. .

You‚Äôre ok. My layman‚Äôs understanding is that over 70 the side affects outweighs the benefits of long term use. It doesn‚Äôt to me imply that 1 day at 100 will hurt you (bar some u comfortable side effects on the day."
worried about double dose (not medical advice!),">and i also know that 100mg isnt exactly completely unheard of, but probably would be impossible for me considering im a smaller dude



Weight doesn't matter at all as far as I know.

You could take some Vitamin C if you feel like it might have been too high of a dose. 

For relaxation google ""physiological sigh"", you'll find some Huberman labs videos about it. Two inhales through the nose, followed by a long exhale through the mouth."
worried about double dose (not medical advice!),"So this advice is complete shit, but I've done it, and it was fine for me, except very jittery.

My dose is 60mg a day

One day i took 80mg in the morning, then another 60mg at around 11 am, once the main effects wore off. Nothing bad happened, and i dont plan on doing it again. The reason i took it is i had a hectic cold, and i had a lot of stuff to do and just wanted to feel half decent.

Point of why i say it, tho, is you will be fine, just ride it out. A tertiary google search says the overdose amount is near towards 1000mgs"
worried about double dose (not medical advice!),"ack i was hoping my stupid fast metabolism would get it outta my body quickly but alas. i guess i‚Äôll be awake late lmao. i know logically that high doses are really only terribly bad in long term use, but my brain has been on an ‚Äúoverthinking everything‚Äù streak (probably due to the new kittens and being paranoid for their safety) so thank you for reminding me! im gonna keep an eye on my BPM and take it easy today haha."
worried about double dose (not medical advice!),"thankfully i already take vitamin C, and i was thinking that may help me! i can never remember if weight is that much of a factor, because if how long ago i was prescribed it haha. thank you so much!"
Heart races if i eat before/shortly after taking my medication ,"I have this issue with 50mg. I have asked to stop elvanse  and go on Amfexa as Amfexa didn‚Äôt cause this for me. Elvanse causes my chest to be physically sore and tight, I have to massage my chest literally to ease it. It‚Äôs awful. My body really dislikes elvanse. I get a pounding heart too, when I lay down it‚Äôs even worse!"
Extremely variable results on 70mg,70 mg is the max amount one should be taking according to the FDA. I‚Äôve been on 60 mg for about 3-4 years and that worked out just fine for me overall.
Extremely variable results on 70mg,"Yep I'm aware I'm on max dose .. that was a concern from the start for me, no room for tolerance adjustments! But it is where we started to see at least some progress. I am a big guy and also very ""pharmaceutical tolerant"" - most rx drugs that have been prescribed to me over the years that commonly have CNS side effects typically don't have those effects on me. Just not real happy with the inconsistent effect of Vyvanse at this point.. 3, mayby 4 effective days this month isn't going to keep me employed long.."
Does Vyvanse helps w/ Grieving?,"Vyvanse helped me control my emotions when dealing with my mom‚Äôs cancer. It really helped because I ended up having to be the level headed one in her appointments and gather info. 
But on the other hand, my childhood dog who was my baby passed away in August and there‚Äôs absolutely nothing that helps with the level of grief and pain I‚Äôm feeling"
Vyvanse and Its Interaction with Fluoxetine/Wellbutrin,"I was taking Wellbutrin when I started Vyvanse. The first day I had the Vyvanse I forgot my WB and I was like wow I feel so calm/clear headed this is amazing. Next day I realized I forgot WB so made sure to take it with the Vyvanse and I did not feel good. Very jittery/agitated/warm and I could feel my heart being weird. On the packet that the pharmacy gives you when you pick up the Vyvanse, bupropion is flagged as having interactions. I ended up stopping the WB, but I do miss it because on WB I was getting up and straight out of bed in the AM after 8 hrs sleep but now that I‚Äôm not on it I sleep 9-10 hours and find it so hard to get up. But for me the Vyvanse outweighs the WB so I guess I have to deal with sleeping more lol"
Vyvanse and Its Interaction with Fluoxetine/Wellbutrin,Exactly how I feel with and without WB. Without WB vyvanse feels clean focus but I miss the WB energy but that comes with roller coaster of emotions. I haven't taken WB in 2 days now.
Has anything changed for you if you went from higher dose back to a lower dose? ,I don‚Äôt think a 10mg difference would screw up your dopamine system.
Has anything changed for you if you went from higher dose back to a lower dose? ,it might take a few days for your brain/body to get adjusted to any kind of dose
Has anything changed for you if you went from higher dose back to a lower dose? ,What do you mean by it's not working?
Has anything changed for you if you went from higher dose back to a lower dose? ,"Feels different. 
And the difference in how they each made me feel is HUGE"
Has anything changed for you if you went from higher dose back to a lower dose? ,"I‚Äôm not able to focus as well..like it feels like 50% effective than usual. 
In my bed unmotivated. Something‚Äôs up with my dopamine levels apparently."
Has anything changed for you if you went from higher dose back to a lower dose? ,Are you taking anything else in conjunction with the Vyvanse?
Has anything changed for you if you went from higher dose back to a lower dose? ,Nope
Has anything changed for you if you went from higher dose back to a lower dose? ,"It may be that your body is trying to adjust to the drug. It takes some time after you first try it to find the dose that works best for you & your body, in my experience."
Gastritis & Vyvanse ,"Yes, I just have to make sure I eat a big breakfast when I take it and make sure I‚Äôm not leaving too much time between eating. I found that as long as I make sure I snack in between meals and don‚Äôt take it on an empty stomach then it‚Äôs fine. Also be wary that anti-acids can make the vyvanse stronger, so don‚Äôt take any until a few hours after you took your Vyvanse to avoid interactions."
Gastritis & Vyvanse ,"Also gastritis and started vyvanse ~2 months ago. Vyvanse itself doesn't seem to have impacted my gastritis directly - It's the side effect of killing your appetite that may get you in trouble. As already mentioned, make sure you get some food into you and actively make sure you get whatever snacks you need throughout the day. Time anti-acids a few hours away from your vyvanse dose, and you should be fine."
Gastritis & Vyvanse ,Good to hear! How are you doing with your gastritis?
Gastritis & Vyvanse ,Good to hear! How are you doing with your gastritis?
Gastritis & Vyvanse ,"I get gastritis every now and then if I‚Äôve skipped meals or had a particularly stressful time! Otherwise I just have GERD but I‚Äôve had that since way before I started Vyvanse, only thing I‚Äôve noticed that makes it worse/triggers gastritis since being on Vyvanse is the food thing. I will get gastritis if I take Vyvanse on an empty stomach"
Gastritis & Vyvanse ,"Pretty well - Made a very significant dietary changes to avoid triggering foods and overall be more gastritis friendly, along with omeprazole, and it's mostly under control. Will be following up in a few months with my Dr to see if more intervention is needed."
Gastritis & Vyvanse ,What's your daily diet like? Just looking for ideas
First week vyvanse,Stay hydrated. I recommend 2 gatorlyte drinks or similar for your first week. And stay away from caffeine for the first week or two. But in general the caffeine will make you jittery unless you're really used to it
First week vyvanse,Make sure you‚Äôre eating and drinking plenty of water. I try to delay caffeine intake and I take tyrosine and b vitamins in the afternoon which I think has helped
First week vyvanse,"Up the dose. And thanks for reminding me to go get my new meds. I'm also on 20mg. Same thing and feeling as you describe. Yesterday* was immediately upped to 40mg in the morning and 20mg in the afternoon. Go for a reevaluation.

Edit; I take 2x 20mg per day for a week already even though I was described just 1x20/day but still those 2 doesn't feel as enough in the end of the day."
First week vyvanse,yeah nah the anger it goes away after a month or two or maybe more. i used to be super angry all the time but it just took more adjusting lol. i started on 40mg and now im on 50mg and i dont get angry anymore
First week vyvanse,"My go to is propranolol 20mg and a decaf latte. The former makes me less anxious and slows my heartrate, the latter gets my mind going and warms me up."
First week vyvanse,Talk to your prescriber.  Let them know what's going on.  But I have to say my first week was a lot more intense than the weeks after. Things seem to have settled down.
First week vyvanse,This is so helpful. I started two days ago and haven‚Äôt slept well and chest is sooo tight in the afternoon it almost hurt and made me hyper aware of my heart. I drink water w electric but I‚Äôll include vitamins as well. So glad to see I‚Äôm not alone. It‚Äôs like my brain is saying thank God for you but my body is saying hold on a sec‚Ä¶
First week vyvanse,"Huh, now for me I've noticed so far that my anger/irritability has gone way down, and even when I do get peeved I return to baseline a lot quicker/easier. But I'm glad that even though med made you have anger for a while that you adjusted and don't deal with that anymore!"
First week vyvanse,On 20mg
First week vyvanse,yeah my anger is basically gone now i only get angry when i don‚Äôt get enough sleep which is an obvious given to any human that exists
Just upped my dose and now having issues down below.,Typical side effect when you increase the dosage which usually gets better
Just upped my dose and now having issues down below.,"Not something I've dealt with (okay I'm being open with y'all I'm trans so you will see me use female pronouns but in the interest of sharing knowledge of body to assist others here, I will be open on even the male aspects) personally on this med but since it is a vasoconstrictor so perhaps dehydration could be a part of it?"
What‚Äôs 40mg vyvanse equivalent to in dexamphetamine dose?,15-ish MG; https://psychopharmacopeia.com/stimulant_conversion.php
What‚Äôs 40mg vyvanse equivalent to in dexamphetamine dose?,Looked on my prescription box and it says 40mg is equivalent to 11.9mg of dexamphetamine :)
What‚Äôs 40mg vyvanse equivalent to in dexamphetamine dose?,Thanks that website super helpful
What‚Äôs 40mg vyvanse equivalent to in dexamphetamine dose?,"Technically, wouldn't it be more like 3 x 5mg or 2 x 7.5mg spread out over the day? Taking the same dose equivalent in one go probably is way too much at the peak I would assume, but I have no first hand experience with dex."
What‚Äôs 40mg vyvanse equivalent to in dexamphetamine dose?,Ok thank you.
What‚Äôs 40mg vyvanse equivalent to in dexamphetamine dose?,Yes. I take 15 spread put over 3 doses. Taking it all at once would only last 4 to 6 hrs
What‚Äôs 40mg vyvanse equivalent to in dexamphetamine dose?,"Yes, that‚Äôs correct. The conversion is ‚ÄúX amount of XR converts to Y amount of IR‚Äù, but that conversion is during a longer duration."
What‚Äôs 40mg vyvanse equivalent to in dexamphetamine dose?,"Vyvanse isn‚Äôt XR, it‚Äôs a different mechanism, so I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs true here as well"
What‚Äôs 40mg vyvanse equivalent to in dexamphetamine dose?,"Extended duration or absorption or metabolisation would be a better way to describe it, but in this case it doesn‚Äôt really change anything."
What‚Äôs 40mg vyvanse equivalent to in dexamphetamine dose?,"It could because it's more affected by individual metabolism. There aren't three separate doses in there, it's one dose that seems to be metabolized at different rates by different people (at least that's the impression one gets reading this sub). So someone who feels it for 6 hours is probably experiencing a different dosage of dextroamphetamine than someone who feels it for 12 hours."
What‚Äôs 40mg vyvanse equivalent to in dexamphetamine dose?,Same goes for IR or XR‚Äôed meds ;)
Starting Vyvance tomorrow - job interview next week,"I would start, but I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily increase. The 20mg dose is low, so you‚Äôre extremely unlikely to have any adverse effects. It‚Äôs much more likely to give you a nice boost of confidence and optimism :)

Just skip coffee/caffeine the first couple of days and all will be well."
Starting Vyvance tomorrow - job interview next week,Start the meds. Hopefully it helps with fidgety for the interview if that‚Äôs something you do. GL üçÄ
Starting Vyvance tomorrow - job interview next week,"The first few days/weeks of trying ADHD meds for me were the best days of my life. Everything was more clear, easier, and I had so much energy. I would use that to my advantage and start a few days before my dream job interview!"
Starting Vyvance tomorrow - job interview next week,That's pretty much what I'm thinking. Skip caffeine only the first couple of days?
Starting Vyvance tomorrow - job interview next week,"Fidgety, say inappropriate stuff, overshare, is my usual interview style."
Starting Vyvance tomorrow - job interview next week,"Started this morning, feel super chilled, not what I expected! But I think I will do just that, go along to the interview clear, calm and collected instead of my usual hyped up blabbering mess!!"
Starting Vyvance tomorrow - job interview next week,"It gives me a bit of jitters and restlessness/lack of focus, so at least the first days until you know if your reaction is super mild or if you feel it quite a bit. I waited with coffee about 3 months, and have now taken another coffee break because Vyvanse + coffee makes me pee every 30 minutes üòÇüò≠. I‚Äôm on 30mg, have been for about a year."
Starting Vyvance tomorrow - job interview next week,"I'm new to Vyvanse myself. My first two days I started due to habit I took 200mg caffeine with my starting dose of 30mg of Vyvanse. Energy was absolutely wild the first two days. I been cutting back on caffeine and I'm higher on Vyvanse dosage now. 

I wouldn't skip caffeine entirely just have a lower dose, caffeine withdrawal is a bitch. I would typically have 400mg-1000mg of caffeine a day before Vyvanse now I only take 100mg and I feel much better overall."
Starting Vyvance tomorrow - job interview next week,Take the meds :)
Brand name savings? ,You can put the goodrx app on your phone to check prices at local pharmacies. I think CVS is about 75 with goodrx
Brand name savings? ,Oh really??? That‚Äôs amazing it was coming up as like $400 for a 30 day supply. Is that goodrx gold the one you pay a monthly subscription for? Thank you again!!
Brand name savings? ,"Not for brand name. Brand name will still be 400 +/-

I'm having issues with generic being very inconsistent so have been considering.. but that's just not realistic for me."
Starting tomorrow ,You‚Äôre gonna love it seriously. It‚Äôs the best.
Starting tomorrow ,"I felt the exact same way. The meds will be out of your system in just a few hours so if you don‚Äôt like it, it‚Äôs ok. Everyone‚Äôs experience is different but chances are good that you‚Äôll have a great day tomorrow. Everything will be suddenly quiet in your mind, you‚Äôll be able to be focus and motivated to do what you need. Honestly nothing compares to my first day, but Vyvanse has been helpful still. If you don‚Äôt like the effects, it may be the dosage or the wrong medication. Report back tomorrow?"
Starting tomorrow ,"take it with food so it lasts longer! and remember that it takes about 2 hours to come into effect. dont forget to eat something in the middle of the day too. 

it helped me so much by making a lot of things more tolerable. usually daily activities were unbearable for me to do more than a few minutes but now they're a breeze and i love it so much."
Starting tomorrow ,Skip coffee and eat protein for breakfast. Have water available during the day. You CAN take half dose first day if you are really anxious just so you see there‚Äôs nothing to be anxious about :) pour the pill contents into water and drink half if you want to. But there‚Äôs no need. It‚Äôs going to be awesome! üòä
Starting tomorrow ,"For me taking less always helps me feel less nervous. I think it‚Äôs a control thing haha. If you pour out some of the capsule it can help give you a little intro to what you might feel.

What dose are they starting you on? 


Also if it helps I‚Äôve been on basically every stimulant that‚Äôs prescribed and vyvanse is by far the most gentle and actually helped with my anxiety. I think it‚Äôll be really beneficial ü©∑"
Starting tomorrow ,You should have a pretty great day tomorrow. Eat breakfast or at the very least have a protein shake.
Starting tomorrow ,why do my eyes feel stuck open? lmao
Starting tomorrow ,Thank you‚ù§Ô∏è
Starting tomorrow ,Thank you! this actually made me feel better. i will update tomorrow ‚ù§Ô∏è
Starting tomorrow ,Definitely this! Especially if you have a sensitive stomach. A big breakfast is a must so the drug works longer.
Starting tomorrow ,what time do you recommend taking it?
Starting tomorrow ,I recommend electrolyte drinks. Like at least 2 gatorlytes on your first week or two
Starting tomorrow ,30mg!
Starting tomorrow ,is this how a normal brain feels??
Starting tomorrow ,"8-9am for me. It‚Äôs trial and error when you start out. But the earlier you take it, the better you will sleep. I never take it past 11am :)"
Starting tomorrow ,I got one this morning! i feel like i can‚Äôt stop chugging down drinks today lol. thank you
Starting tomorrow ,TBH OP might well find the opposite: that sleeping becomes much easier on the meds. I know I do. Calms me down a ton.
Starting tomorrow ,okay thank you! these were tips i didn‚Äôt know about and i honestly can never sleep so ill take it pretty early
Starting tomorrow ,"Definitely take it earlier if you already have issues with sleep. I have bad sleep, too. The person underneath is right in saying that it can improve sleep in some people. It‚Äôll be a trial run until you know what works for you. Good luck! üòä"
Starting tomorrow ,omg is this how a normal brain feels?
Starting tomorrow ,"Ahhh! I‚Äôm so happy for you! It‚Äôs so perplexing at first, right? ü•≤"
Starting tomorrow ,"yes, i‚Äôm almost emotional because i‚Äôve lived with a chaotic brain for so long"
"My Dr wants to put me on Vyvanse, but I'm not too sure...",What have been your dosages? I remember reading somewhere recently that when people take ADHD meds and don‚Äôt have ADHD it can cause ADHD symptoms. I‚Äôm definitely not trying to invalidate your diagnosis but is it possible you have something besides ADHD? Or maybe a non stimulant would work better for you.
"My Dr wants to put me on Vyvanse, but I'm not too sure...","Vyvanse is probably the best one for people who have more simple problems with adhd. 
I was a lot like you, I was able to manage things and do every day things but I struggled so hard with motivating myself to do things and to actually regulate my emotions. 

From what I understand and what my doctor told me vyvanse is about as basic as it get, if it doesn‚Äôt work then you will probably feel anxious and a little wired.

But if it is working you will feel normal and for me I can honestly say that I have never felt more normal in my entire life. 
Also it just makes you feel better in general and for me just simply feeling better has made everything so much easier"
"My Dr wants to put me on Vyvanse, but I'm not too sure...","Honestly based on what you tried already I don't expect it to work either. I mean, if it's not costing you extra it doesn't hurt to give it a try, but I can't imagine why it would work when adderall does nothing. Maybe try wellbutrin instead first?"
"My Dr wants to put me on Vyvanse, but I'm not too sure...","mine has worked pretty good since i started, i believe it is the upping time though, but sometimes ill take 60mg and that works wonders for my adhd.. So i would highly recommend starting it and ATLEAST trying to use it, keep in mind it is an amphetamine"
"My Dr wants to put me on Vyvanse, but I'm not too sure...","Even within ADHD not everyone reacts the same to the same meds because ADHD is a flawed catch-all diagnosis for a symptom-cluster that likely is created by a combination of different root causes that vary from person to person, and Vyvanse etc. just happen to work for most people by dumb luck because whether you have a lack of dopamine signalling or you need to downregulate your dopamine receptors, stimulants can do both, depending on dosage."
"My Dr wants to put me on Vyvanse, but I'm not too sure...",Yes..!!it's horrible side effects in mentally..  Brain hacked üôÇ
Antibiotics (Amoxicillin) + Vyvanse = Ineffective Meds,Yeah I was taking antibiotics for pneumonia and my meds did not work either and it took a couple days after the course was finished for them to work again.
Antibiotics (Amoxicillin) + Vyvanse = Ineffective Meds,"Same. I‚Äôve stopped taking them until I‚Äôm done. It‚Äôs either the interaction, or the fact that I‚Äôm sick"
Antibiotics (Amoxicillin) + Vyvanse = Ineffective Meds,"Yes, the very same and feel very out of sorts in general after amoxycillin. I wonder what would help?"
It doesn't seem to be working ,"I was in the same boat. I‚Äôm currently on the 50mg atm as the other dosages weren‚Äôt working after awhile. For me I won‚Äôt sleep or eat or even really drink much for about a week or so, and after that I‚Äôll be calmer. It‚Äôll take some time and hopefully you‚Äôll find the right dosage for you. Just keep an eye out on your eating sleeping and drinking habits really"
Vyvanse Hair Loss,I also learned that Vyvanse acts as a vasoconstrictor which shrinks blood vessels in the scalp. Incorporate daily massages to stimulate blood circulation on the scalp. It‚Äôs hard and I struggle with it too but this has definitely helped.
Vyvanse Hair Loss,"Get your hormones tested. I just was losing hair in the front very recently and I got them tested, I was low in estrogen and high in testosterone. I‚Äôm on spirolactone and it seems to be helping slowly for sure . It‚Äôs also surprisingly helping with some ADHD problems. Along with vyvanse"
Vyvanse Hair Loss,"maybe just iron deficiency or even vitamin b12, it was that at least in my case"
Vyvanse Hair Loss,Omg are you me??! I also struggled with an Ed in high school and lost all my hair tooü•≤I‚Äôve been wearing extensions for about a year now but my hair is finally growing again after 3 years and got very long! My hairdresser told me the other day that I don‚Äôt even need extensions anymore. I didn‚Äôt experience this but I feel for you because losing your hair is so hard especially when you struggled with an Ed. My hair makes me feel confident and safe in myself which might sound a bit dramatic but I remember how sad and angry I felt at myself for losing all this hair to that stupid and evil ed. I‚Äôm so sorry for you friend and I hope things get better for you. I would suggest seeing your doctor and getting some blood work done.
Vyvanse Hair Loss,"Magnesium and zink is something you often have a defficeny in, not harmful to supplement. Since I've started elvanse I've been taking more of those and cramps and brainfog has cleared"
Vyvanse Hair Loss,"I have hair loss as well on 30mg. I think it‚Äôs because the meds make me not want to eat ever, so I have malnutrition, which causes hair thinning."
Vyvanse Hair Loss,Happened to me also at first. It stops after a while. It's your body getting used to the medicine
Vyvanse Hair Loss,I‚Äôve lost some hair but I find that if I take some break days then I don‚Äôt lose much more hair. Stress and ageing play a role. Vyvanse dehydrates you. Try to get more well hydrated like coconut water + ‚Ä¢lime juice at the end of the night or Gatorade
Vyvanse Hair Loss,25 mg of zink per day is no risk at all.
Vyvanse Hair Loss,"This happened with me and it‚Äôs terrible! I started Vyvanse a few years ago and my hair is much thinner than when I started. I started noticing it a few months after I started taking it. Changed meds, had a lot of life stress, then aging (early 40‚Äôs!), back to Vyvanse, and my hair has never recovered, sadly. 

My next step is to try minoxidil."
Vyvanse Hair Loss,"Call your doctor asap! They might be able to order blood tests or something, or give you advice for between now and your next appointment. Or possibly even squeeze you in for a sooner emergency appointment."
Vyvanse Hair Loss,Major hair loss happening rn. üòû
Vyvanse Hair Loss,most people arent lacking in biotin. Honestly drink water and eat nutritious foods and maybe check blood levels
Vyvanse Hair Loss,"I have four practical suggestions that won‚Äôt require you to give up Vyvanse (caveat: I have only tried the first three myself):

1) use bond builders like K18 leave in molecular hair mask, Olaplex No. 3, or Redken acidic bonding concentrate. (There are others, but I haven‚Äôt tried them. I alternate between these 3, and use one every other wash.) They will strengthen the hair you have, causing less breakage, which will make your hair appear thicker. The appearance of my hair began improving after my very first use, which helped  calm my anxiety. These will cost you  anywhere from $50 - $150 a month. 

2) Platelet rich plasma (PRP) injections. My dermatologist did a series of 3 treatments, spaced 4 weeks apart. I had great results. I have heard platelet rich fibrin produces even better results, but I haven‚Äôt tried it. The cost for me was $2500, but it varies by location.

3) Test your ferritin levels and supplement if low. Theres a prescription form of iron that your doc can prescribe. Your hair can‚Äôt grow if you don‚Äôt have sufficient iron.  Cost should be minimal.

4) Oral minoxidil. I have a prescription and will start soon. Both my dermatologist and endocrinologist highly recommend it. Cost for me is $10 with insurance."
Vyvanse Hair Loss,Taket supplements. Amphetamines depletes your body of essential vitamins and minerals.
Vyvanse Hair Loss,You're just getting old... Normal
Vyvanse Hair Loss,Thank you for this
Vyvanse Hair Loss,"i was and am in the exact same boat. it's so distressing losing all that hair and i just felt so stupid for essentially having done it to myself. extensions were a lifesaver, i felt so confident and they allowed me hair to grow out in the meantime. thanks for your response, it's nice to feel like someone understands ‚ô•Ô∏è"
Vyvanse Hair Loss,"yep magnesium is great. ¬†you just wanna be careful with zinc bc there is a possibility taking too much of it can deplete copper, but i think usually it has this warning on the bottle¬†"
Vyvanse Hair Loss,"I also eat a lot less on Vyvanse and have lost a considerable amount of weight. I do take a multivitamin ( prenatal) which is supposed to be good for your hair. My hair is still thinning, I wonder what it would be like if I was not taking the vitamins!"
Vyvanse Hair Loss,"No, but even 5mg makes me wanna vom ü§¢"
Vyvanse Hair Loss,I am so sorry to hear that:( it scares me a lot to go through that whole ordeal again and very distressing. I hope your hair also can recover<3
Vyvanse Hair Loss,Get hormones tested and look into Spirolactone
Vyvanse Hair Loss,Pumpkin seed oil in coconut shampoo helps big time
Vyvanse Hair Loss,The mind is powerfully so think as though you already have that set of hair
Vyvanse Hair Loss,Thank you for your thorough response! I appreciate it a lot:)
Vyvanse Hair Loss,"but Op should definitely go to a doctor beforehand to check if there are even any deficiencies, taking supplements without being certain if they're even needed could also do harm :)"
Vyvanse Hair Loss,Most folks don't start losing hair while in university.  That is neither old or normal
Vyvanse Hair Loss,"Thank you! I have learned to live with it, but I feel like it definitely ages me to have my hair thinning and also turning gray. The benefits from Vyvanse outweigh this unfortunate side effect. (but who knows, maybe this would‚Äôve happened anyway, I am a woman in my early 40s.)"
Vyvanse Hair Loss,"Thank you! Maybe this is a dumb question, but how do you get your hormones tested? Is this an OB/GYN thing, a regular blood test, etc.?"
Vyvanse Hair Loss,"yes OP absolutely get ferritin test. ¬†a level under 100 is not optimal and under 30 is deficient. you want it to be optimal for the body to fix otself. ¬†theres a facebook group called the iron protocol, get on there for help with this , im willing to bet theres deficiencies going on from the history of ED. ¬†also vitamin d, folate and B12 very important¬†"
Vyvanse Hair Loss,My pleasure
Vyvanse Hair Loss,yes go for a blood test but get a copy of those results for yourself because there are too many cases of doctors not knowing how to diagnose a deficiency (happened to me and many others having to sort out their own iron deficiency). ¬†there are also some supplements that are safe to take without a test such as magnesium¬†

*About 25% of people assigned male at birth see the first signs of hair loss before age 21.*

100% normal"
Vyvanse Hair Loss,Is OP AMAB? They were giving AFAB. üòÜ
Vyvanse Hair Loss,"It's normal for both genders. Men tend to recede, women tend to thin. As we age, hair is lost. Normal part of life. Vyvanse isn't the cause"
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?","The reason it is recommended to eat breakfast is because you need protein for dopamine and norepinephrine production. Specifically, you need tyrosine, an amino acid you derive from protein. 

If you have a hard time eating or want to do intermittent fasting, try supplementing with tyrosine in the morning. It‚Äôs very beneficial if you have low/no protein intake, as the efficacy of Vyvanse is restricted if there‚Äôs a low level of tyrosine available. 

Tyrosine will be created by the body from phenylalanine, but that metabolism doesn‚Äôt seem to speed up commensurately with Vyvanse trying to ramp up your dopamine and norepinephrine production. So directly increasing tyrosine availability is beneficial in allowing the drug to work optimally. That is, if you‚Äôre fasting. If you eat protein then there‚Äôs basically no need to supplement."
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?","Does an iced coffee count? Honestly, I‚Äôve never been a breakfast gal, even before Vyvanse. I know they say protein helps, but I usually just grab a croissant, an english muffin, or biscotti."
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?","I honestly feel as if my meds work better when I don‚Äôt eat with them,  it if I do eat breakfast it‚Äôs usually a few eggs and a protein shake."
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",Just protein powder with water before I take my meds. Then after a half hour or so I'll try to force myself to actually make breakfast to eat.
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",Liquid protein drink
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",Protein shake
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?","I always have Collagen Protein water (sip it throughout the morning) just have to make sure it doesn‚Äôt have too much vit c in it 

If I can manage breakfast, these are some of my go to options:
- Yogurt pouch (no spoon required lol)
- Just a heap of shaved turkey. Sometimes I layer the turkey on a Bega cheese slice, put kewpie on it and fold the cheese to make a weird cheese sandwich concoction 
- Spoonful of nut butter
- Banana and put nut butter on every couple of bites 
- protein ball"
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",Protein shake. That‚Äôs usually it until dinner ü§£
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",I take vyvanse with no food and I don‚Äôt feel any nausea! I didnt know it was important!
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",Protein water
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?","I have trouble eating breakfast, so I drink an Orgain protein shake. 

To make my life a little easier, the night before, I put the protein powder in one of those Blender Bottles (the reusable bottle with the whisk thing inside to shake it up), but I don‚Äôt put water in. I keep a glass of water next to it on my nightstand so the shake doesn‚Äôt get funky overnight. 

When I wake up in the morning, I dump the water into the protein blender bottle (when I don‚Äôt accidentally dump the water on the floor, which is at least once a week), and then take my Vyvanse immediately with the protein shake. 

People are so passionate about taking Vyvanse with protein that I don‚Äôt question it, so this has become my daily ritual."
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?","Protein shake seems to work best. Banana, plant milk, peanut butter, scoop of chocolate plant protein"
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",I‚Äôm the same - no appetite in the morning but I feel terrible if I take my Vyvanse without something in my stomach. My go-tos are protein shakes (Alani and Fairlife) or literally a scoop of peanut butter from the jar lol.
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",Fair milk protein drink.  Delicious and does the trick
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?","I‚Äôm awful for not eating until 5pm some days when I‚Äôm on a late shift, and find some days that I either don‚Äôt feel much like it‚Äôs just subtly there in the background and then I have days like today where I can‚Äôt stop talking I get abit lightheaded and an unquenchable thirst üòÇ some days genuinely feel like I‚Äôm on sniff or speed (I know it basically is speed)"
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?","protein in my coffee, at most a hard boiled egg. Can‚Äôt stomach much else in the AM, even before vyvanse"
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",A few spoonfuls of cashew butter and a Naked Pea Protein shake with almond milk usually about an hour or two after I take my Vyvanse (or when I start feeling nauseated and shaky because of all the doing instead of eating). It‚Äôs the chewing that turns me off. Just get in my belly already!
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",Greek yogurt and granola!!
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",This isn‚Äôt good advice but I don‚Äôt eat with my Vyvanse and I usually go until 5 without eating. If I‚Äôm desperate I eat a spoonful of peanut butter

Greek yogurt

If you don't want to eat a lot what ever you like as a snack would probably work.¬†"
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?","I never ate breakfast previously but decided to start because of what I‚Äôd heard about Vyvanse needing protein to work effectively. 

I have a shake with frozen mango, milk, vanilla protein every morning. It‚Äôs like a milkshake, so delish."

"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?","Anything in reach, before taking meds, because I have a very large appetite before taking it! After tho‚Ä¶ barely much, I have to set reminders to eat lol"
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?","My psychiatrist told me that he can be taken without food with no problems. I usually take mine without food, but I‚Äôve also taken it and then I‚Äôll make scrambled eggs with grass fed butter 30 minutes after taken Vyvanse. It‚Äôs smooths out the on set of the medicine. Other than that I don‚Äôt really notice much more of a difference."
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?","absolutely nothing as my meds don't work half as well if I have any food. I know the manufacturer says it ""takes at least an hour longer to be metabolised when taken with food"" but I feel like it more than halves it's effectiveness for me, not just take longer to work ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è So breakfast I have 2 cups of tea and a decaf coffee, lunch a couple of pieces of non citrus based fruit, then I have a big main meal in the evening around 6-7pm

"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?","I dont really eat anything but sometimes i get those oikos protein that you drink. It fills me up a little and gets me proteins but its not as bad as actually chewing. 
(Idk why but i cant actually get myself to chew something in the morning). Plus, it tastes great!"
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",A yogurt or a protein drink.
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?","I prep my breakfasts on Sunday and Wednesday (my only days off. Hard boiled eggs, protein shake mixed into overnight oats. Or I mix my shake with my matcha or coffee. Or I eat two big spoonfuls of peanut butter and leave the house."
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",I‚Äôm not usually hungry in the morning but I make myself eat a protein bar lol
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",I take my meds and go back to sleep. I don‚Äôt eat anything with them. When I wake up I have a protein shake
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",I eat a fiber one coffee cake or a banana or a piece of toast. You literally only need a few bites of something to help with tummy issues ü©∑‚úåüèº

"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",I‚Äôm not much of an eater overall and I tend to wait until dinner time cause by then the meds have worn down. If I do eat in the morning I‚Äôll eat maybe a hash brown
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?","I have a whole milk latte with all of my morning meds every day. I take some meds that need protein and some that need fat and have a hard time consuming anything but coffee in the morning. But, if I throw a shot of instant espresso in a glass of milk it goes down pretty easy."
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",I heard it was specifically protein so I swallow two big spoonfuls of high protein yoghurt (9 grams)
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",One weetbix or banana at 7.30am just to take my meds üôÉ
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",Protein shake or whatever I might slightly be interested in bc it‚Äôs not much lol . This morning I had some thanksgiving leftovers ü§£honestly whatever to get some protein.
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",Taking Vyvanse with food can delay it up to like 30 minutes before it kicks in so instead of the advertised 60 minutes it might take 90 minutes. Outside of that taking it with food has no proof of whether it makes it more effective. I've done both and I literally had no difference. I just take it every morning on an empty stomach since I work out fasted anyway.
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",Protein bar (at least half + glass of water)
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",A few peanut butter crackers.
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?","I am a breakfast eater, but I take my pills around 5 am and I eat breakfast at 9-ish, so I guess I am not really a breakfast eater, I just eat breakfast foods in the late morning, lol. 

I put a Frog Fuel packet next to my pills and eat it with my pills.  Then I suck down a muscle milk pro shake about 30 minutes later.  The ones in the small box have 32g protein and I can gulp them down fast."
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?","These caffeine electrolytes by mio üíÄI love them, it‚Äôs 81 mg of caffeine I think for one stick. Really wakes me up and it helps me a lot with dehydration since Vyvanse makes me thirsty all the time"
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?","Soft things like cheese, protein drinks, potatoes, yogurt, or sometimes muffins. Just has to be easy to eat or digest."
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",applesauce! the go go squeeze bottles have w fruits and veg are my fave rn
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",Built protein bars
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?","Overnight oats! Coconut yoghurt, oats, dark chocolate chips and raspberries. Then a pint of water with my meds before I leave the house. Usually keeps me good till I get home from work."
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?","If I don't eat that's when I feel my meds kick-in and quite aggressively. I usually have a bowl of protein greek yoghurt, banana, some walnuts and a bit of honey might change depending how I am feeling, when in a rush I just have a protein shake and then I don't feel my meds kick-in, just smooth sailing and more attentive."
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?","Coffee with A LOT of heavy cream, and then I take multivitamin, probiotic, omega 3-6-9 supplements and ¬†magnesium citrate powder¬†"
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",I just drink a 30mg protein shake when I wake up. I can get it down pretty quickly. Food nauseates me in the morning even if I don‚Äôt take my meds when I wake up. You can get a pack of the protein shakes for pretty cheap at Costco. I also do a protein bar mid day if I can‚Äôt get myself to eat anything else.
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?","Ensure High Protein. Like 130 calories with 16g Protein. Vitamins and minerals. 

Or Ensure Plus. It's like 340 calories with 16g protein. Vitamin and minerals.

And I HAVE to eat something due to my Anti-depressant I'm taking with it."
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",I'd recommend buying some protein power (try a casein as it thickens) and mixing it with some yoghurt. I do casein with greek yoghurt and some sweetener
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?","Huel, double scoop, half milk, scoop of ice cream. Full of sugar and calories but I cut sugar out for the rest of the day."
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",Flat white coffee üòÖ

"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",Oh thx for this! I need to get some of that then
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",Sorry is 500 or 1000mg best?
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",i feel ya. coffee is the one thing i‚Äôm ever consistent with in the mornings. i love me a good croissant too but not at 6-7 in the morning üòñ i‚Äôve considered taking my meds later but i like for it to have ‚Äúkicked in‚Äù by the time i start work.
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",Same over here
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?","Sameeee like honestly I barely feel any effect at all if I eat on them, even lunch I just have an apple & melon or something very light, I make up in the evening, but it's like as soon as food enters the equation, meds exit stage left and that's it's for the day üò≠"
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",Same thing I eat. I have also pre-cooked bacon in the air fryer (or oven) to have something easy to grab for protein. Eggs really are the best go-to IMO. I also use the air fryer to make hard boiled eggs and put them in a container in the fridge to grab if I don't feel like cooking.
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?","The timing for effectiveness always varies for me, it‚Äôs annoying"
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",Oh and always iced coffee lol
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?","I make a frappucino with a FairLife chocolate protein shake, instant cafe bustelo, and ice. Keeps me going until dinner, too."
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",It helps to have some protein of some sort like an egg or protein shake.
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?","I prefer unsweetened whey protein isolate with almond milk, MCT oil and lechitin. I recently tried unsweetened whey isolate and I don't think Im going back"
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?","Sorry for the tmi but.. I‚Äòve tried protein shakes, literally just powder and milk. I threw it (and my meds) up on day four. Cursed"
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",Have you noticed a difference??
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",Have you noticed a difference??
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",I‚Äôm not too sure as I started the shakes when I started the Vyvanse. I probably did _too_ much research before I started the medication üòÇ
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?","This comment made me laugh because I relate. 

Since it gave me a chuckle, I looked at your profile and I saw your embroidery work. You do amazing work, I love it!"
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs bad at all. just want to try it for a bit to see if it really makes a difference for me.
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?","I also don't eat anything with my meds. I have several meds I take first thing in the morning, and two of them have to be taken on an empty stomach and I can't eat anything for about an hour afterwards. I've wondered if this might affect my absorption of the Vyvanse, but I don't think it does."
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",You can feel the difference?????
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",Lol right üòÇüòÇüòÇ
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",have u noticed if the coffee affected it's effectiveness or irregular heartbeat?  I've been trying to stay away from coffee because I've read you're not supposed to have coffee...but I'm a coffee guy and would normally have loe 2 shots of espresso in the morning and 3 cups of coffee throughout the day and a decade before bed lol.
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",I wish . That brands inflames me like no other
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",How long do you sleep after taking Vyvanse before you wake up again?
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?","Blend it with some almond milk and ice for a shake, much more pleasant to drink."
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",omg kefir!!! this i can probably get with.
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",how‚Äôs your energy throughout the day?
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?","this is what i‚Äôve been running off of since i started vyvanse 2.5 months ago. flat whites and cortados, but only if im working from home üôÇ"
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",Why is this getting downvoted so bad wtf that sounds good
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?","500mg increases your blood level available tyrosine by roughly 50-100 ¬µmol/L, whereas a full fledged animal protein meal raises it by roughly 100-150 ¬µmol/L. So 500mg is very likely enough, as Vyvanse only increase your tyrosine utilization by 10-20%. It‚Äôs a rather modest effect, but we‚Äôre quite sensitive to dopamine levels. You metabolize about 8-40 ¬µmol/L of Tyrosine per hour, and with 50mg of Vyvanse it becomes more like 10-50 ¬µmol/L.

If I don‚Äôt have time to eat in the morning I will take 500mg of Tyrosine and feel the drug working as expected. If I don‚Äôt eat or take tyrosine I‚Äôm a bit sluggish. I don‚Äôt feel any different taking 500 or 1000mg."
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?","P.S. If you go a full day without eating, and only really eat a healthy portion of protein after 6PM or something like that, your body will really be scraping the bottom of the barrel in terms of Tyrosine, so you could potentially find it useful to take another 500mg when you would normally have lunch."
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?","Maybe something like a Carnation Instant Breakfast or the like would help you at least get something in your stomach? 

Pretty sure they‚Äôre loaded with sugar - I absolutely loved them as a kid but haven‚Äôt had one in ages. 

Chugging almond milk is my go to for when I‚Äôm ravenous but can‚Äôt yet eat because I‚Äôm doing all the things and the thought of forcing myself to chew even half of a cashew butter semmich makes me gag. 

The struggle continues, but I‚Äôd be lost without my almond milk. Helps with my acid reflux, too! Good luck finding what worlds for you!"
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?","Thing is, I intermittent fast until noon ü´£ I like the way just vyvanse and black coffee makes me feel ~~~"
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?","I replied but it doesn‚Äôt seem to have come through so I‚Äôll try again! 

I started having protein in the mornings as soon as I started taking Vyvanse so I can‚Äôt really compare. I had pretty bad medication anxiety so I did a lot of research before hand and decided to be safe."
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",Thank you so much!  It's my creative outlet :)
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?","Well, I‚Äôd do notice it‚Äôs like a smooth transition into feeling my meds kick in. Where as if I take the meds without food I feel my meds kick in like immediately. The kick in can be a bit more aggressive. When I do the eggs and butter it‚Äôs slower to kick in and it‚Äôs a bit gentler."
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?","I can feel a big difference between what I consume/ don't consume in the morning with my meds. I always feel best having it with high fibre & protien savoury breakfast, personally"
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?","I work in a restaurant and I drink usually 5-6 shots of strong coffee every shift (morning-afternoon, and night) and for me, it doesn‚Äôt affect at all. I just can‚Äôt work right without coffee. I think it depends, for me it never really made a difference, it gives me more energy with vyvanse. But also I‚Äôm the wanna test guy. If it doesn‚Äôt work for me it doesn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not a ‚Äúif it‚Äôs saying here it‚Äôs bad, or it‚Äôs not gonna work‚Äù.

Try it yourself and see how it goes. Hope you having a wonderful day, friend :)"
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?","I definitely get that! I can‚Äôt drink any other flavours.  Even vanilla bothers me.  Something about the banana and cream brings me back to my childhood, banana penicillin. 

ü§£ i also prioritize steps which helps immensely. I have standing desk and a walking pad at work, so the 10k keeps my tummy moving and less bloated."
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",I tend to be pretty energetic
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?","Great thanks so much, just got some of the 500mg tablets of Amazon, I'll probably do as you suggest and take it 2ce a day, I have a protein rich dinner for sure but as I can only absorb so much at once this hopefully will help a lot with protein absorption... Also got a protein powder as I can definitely manage a shake in the am even if I have it an hour or so before my meds - thx again for your help ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds?",Thank you!  That is very good advice!  Have a great weekend!  üòÅ
90% Sure This Isn‚Äôt My Dose,"Feel like I've been saying this too much lately, but well, here I go again. I recently started splitting my dose, half in the morning and half around noon. It's honestly so much better. Less side effects, lasts longer, less of a crash. Can't believe it's not recommended more."
90% Sure This Isn‚Äôt My Dose,"try splitting the dose, take like 60 percent up front and the other 40 percent in 2-3 hours. You can do this by mixing with water üòÑ"
90% Sure This Isn‚Äôt My Dose,"I know the nap you‚Äôre talking about. I‚Äôve learned how to roll with it. For me it‚Äôs not a lengthy nap after which you wake up as tired as before. I use it as a quick 20-30 minute nap that totally re-energizes me. Here‚Äôs another thing to consider ‚Äî ABSORPTION.  Just because you‚Äôre taking 40mg (or any dosage for that matter) does not mean that your body is fully absorbing it the same. Unless you develop a routine that enables you to absorb it the same way every time. For example: empty stomach vs with food, with 20-30 oz of water or with a soda or coffee. I offer these as just two examples."
90% Sure This Isn‚Äôt My Dose,Have you talked to your doctor about doing your 40 in the morning and then doing like a bump up of 10 or 20 mg in the afternoon. You just need to last a little longer maybe a 10 mg boost about 6 hours after would be helpful. I am new on Vyvanse so I don't know if they make a 10 mg I know they do the 20 mg. But talk to your doctor about it because I told my doctor how I like crash and burn about 4 to 5 hours after taking my 20 mg. He said we could work up to doing 20 in the morning and 20 in the afternoon or should just take 40 in the morning I don't know which one I want to do because I feel 20 isn't enough but I'm on 30 and I still feel like I'm crashing and burning and so exhaustedly like by night time I am so tired I can't handle it It's so bad I can't concentrate I can't stay awake I keep falling asleep like I have narcolepsy or something and that was never how I was before Vyvanse I had sleep issues where I couldn't go to sleep I like the fact that it helps me be sleepy but it's almost too aggressive and it happens too early in the day. So I don't know what I should do I'm trying to figure it I hope you find a solution. I was going to make a post asking people what to do and what they thought I still need to we'll see I was trying to read other people's posts to see what was said on them.
90% Sure This Isn‚Äôt My Dose,"Ok I‚Äôve heard this comment more than you‚Äôve been saying so I‚Äôm going to be blunt about my thinking (and questions) toward the water titration. 
1.) it doesn‚Äôt logically (yes I still believe it works great for everyone that tries it) make sense why being prescribed 40mg for your focus somehow translates to 20mg in the morning suddenly working. I know why taking it spread out works‚Ä¶but how does 20mg give you enough focus in the day? 
2.) I don‚Äôt like not *knowing* the *exact* amount of medicine üíä I am taking. So I tried the water titration already‚Ä¶and I screwed up‚Ä¶well I felt like I did. There I was wondering exactly how much I took. My goal was 45mg to theoretically get longer than 40mg without the intensity of 50mg, and I felt like I took 30 or 35mg, it sucked. 
3.) I think long term and don‚Äôt want to do any more ‚Äúwork‚Äù every morning that‚Äôs more than just popping a pill in my mouth. And also, I work at home so it‚Äôs easy to leave my 2nd dose near, but when out and about, I have a water container I never leave home without so don‚Äôt want to mess with taking more things. 

I‚Äôm not trying to be defensive or cause defensiveness. Just being honest about my feelings and thoughts on this water titration method that works for many but why I personally don‚Äôt prefer it. But only time will tell..maybe after awhile I‚Äôll decide it‚Äôs the best option..will see."
90% Sure This Isn‚Äôt My Dose,"How exactly do
You split it
It‚Äôs granulated capsule"
90% Sure This Isn‚Äôt My Dose,"Agree!! I think this needs to be normalized more. 

Especially because it‚Äôs a medicine you really have to take early in the AM to avoid sleep problems IMO.   Most cannot take 40mg late in the day.   However 20mg at 7am and 20mg at 3pm is chefs kiss for me. Gets me through my work day AND gets me through my evenings. 

All day effects and no insomnia and better appetite."
90% Sure This Isn‚Äôt My Dose,"I hear a lot about using a water bottle for this, but i just get the chewable tablets & break them in half as needed.  Super easy!"

90% Sure This Isn‚Äôt My Dose,"So you still take the nap? 
I can‚Äôt have a nap at that time a day. I‚Äôm off on vacation so now it‚Äôs fine but not starting next week."
90% Sure This Isn‚Äôt My Dose,"There‚Äôs also the option of taking two pills. I was at 30, felt it didn‚Äôt last long enough, got moved to 50, felt that was too high a peak and uncomfortable, got a 30+20 prescription instead, and it‚Äôs WAY better IMO to take a smaller dose through the day than just one behemoth dose of speed that‚Äôs big enough to last an entire day. That just sounds like a crazy idea to me."
90% Sure This Isn‚Äôt My Dose,Well I just asked my doc for two pills. But I've also split via water and at least with Teva generic it worked well.
90% Sure This Isn‚Äôt My Dose,"If I‚Äôm working and the mid-day siesta time is upon me (usually around 4 hours in) and a nap is not an option, I‚Äôll down an energy drink or coffee drink. It throws fuel on the fire."
can i drink alcohol if i dont feel my vyvanse?,"i drink alcohol on a 50mg script of vyvanse lol üò≠üò≠ i just make sure its mostly out of my system (8-12 hours after taking it) before i over indulge in alcohol.

always talk to your pharmacist/doctor before mixing substances, mine have said that it‚Äôs safe for me."
can i drink alcohol if i dont feel my vyvanse?,"When in doubt, just give your local pharmacy or doctor a call :) Pharmacy advice is usually given for free."
can i drink alcohol if i dont feel my vyvanse?,"I think you just need to pay attention to your body. Personally, I have a beer or two most evenings. I noticed how I would feel my heart pounding very hard, when I went to bed. Turned out I needed blood pressure medication. Now that issue is gone and I still enjoy my beer. But the way my heart was pounding before the BP meds surely couldn‚Äôt have been healthy. I‚Äôm in my forties. Probably you aren‚Äôt and won‚Äôt feel the same."
can i drink alcohol if i dont feel my vyvanse?,"someone just posted about this yesterday so you can read the comments there too. (i always drink on vyvanse, it helps with the come down so much lol)"
can i drink alcohol if i dont feel my vyvanse?,"Every time I drank on Vyvanse I wouldn‚Äôt feel it for a while, so I‚Äôd drink more and then it would just fucking hit me HARD. My friends would feel things before I did and I remember while studying 
In school that stimulant drugs like Vyvanse can mask intoxication and impair your judgement. I mean I‚Äôd be a hypocrite if I said don‚Äôt drink but just be mindful of this because the hangover was actual hell for me but it taught me a lesson lolü•≤I also never drank while on 10mg I have though on 40 and 50 mg and that was not good it made me 10x more annoying when I‚Äôd go clubbing idk how my friends put up with meüò≠"
can i drink alcohol if i dont feel my vyvanse?,"10mg is a very low dose! Double-check with your doctor or call a pharmacy, but I think you‚Äôll be fine. My doc gave me the all-clear to have a couple beers from time to time, and I take a MUCH higher dose."
can i drink alcohol if i dont feel my vyvanse?,"10mg is miniscule. The only reason to prescribe it is to check for adverse effects. It won‚Äôt impact drinking much except it might make you feel less inebriated, so don‚Äôt drink like you‚Äôre superman"
can i drink alcohol if i dont feel my vyvanse?,"1. there's nothing wrong with being on 10 mg ignore these other mfs in the comments 
2. yes you can def drink on any amnt of vyvanse don't worry. be sure to drink even more water tho bc both will dehydrate you"
can i drink alcohol if i dont feel my vyvanse?,Yes but your tolerance will be higher so be careful!
can i drink alcohol if i dont feel my vyvanse?,"Better not to drink at all, much less on Vyvanse. The drug is still active even if you do not feel it."

can i drink alcohol if i dont feel my vyvanse?,What the fuck lol
can i drink alcohol if i dont feel my vyvanse?,idk why everyone‚Äôs being so rude. it‚Äôs your body lmao. i‚Äôm on 40mg and i always drink. i‚Äôve always told every doctor this & they‚Äôre not exactly thrilled but it‚Äôs not gonna fuck your body up more just bc you had vyvanse 12 fkn hours ago. ppl are acting like it‚Äôs a benzo or coke or something wth
can i drink alcohol if i dont feel my vyvanse?,i get that it‚Äôs still in my system but vyvanse is a half-life drug. i know that that means it will take 2.5 days for it to fully be cleared from my system but there is a HUGE difference between getting plastered during a vyvanse come-up vs. drinking 8-12 hours later
can i drink alcohol if i dont feel my vyvanse?,"what why am i in danger or something?? üò≠üò≠ i‚Äôve been taking adhd meds for like five years and as a university student i go out to the bars like every weekend, ive never had a problem lol i also use nicotine as well üò≠üò≠"

can i drink alcohol if i dont feel my vyvanse?,girl no need to be rude i literally said that additional sources such as all of my doctors have said multiple times that it is safe for me to consume alcohol with my dosage and they are also all aware of my nicotine consumption. every person is different and both my heart rate and blood pressure are healthy.
can i drink alcohol if i dont feel my vyvanse?,"Feel like adding that my meds dissolved the rest of what was left from my desire to drink. I was drinking heavily age 15-16 and afterwards replaced it with different drugs because of the harm the alcohol did to my stomach and skin. A couple of years wasted on an addiction to prescription downers and finally shortly after quitting successfully I got diagnosed and got treatment for ADHD. Dunno if I could drink responsibly again if I liked it, but I‚Äôm not so big on trying. Alcohol is most enjoyable in social situations in moderation imo, so it‚Äôs best to keep it at that."

Intense / Crazy Eyes on Vyvanse?,"Yeah, Vyvanse can make your pupils dilate. I'm not sure of the exact science behind that, but I experience the same and have read as much. I'm just lucky to have very dark eyes. 

It could go away overtime, but honestly you shouldn't overthink it. People's pupils dilate for all kinds of reasons. I doubt anyone even notices it."
Intense / Crazy Eyes on Vyvanse?,"No one notices :) If they do, it‚Äôs merely subconsciously that that you like them (because pupils dilate when we look at things/people we like) - which is a good thing! üòä"
Intense / Crazy Eyes on Vyvanse?,"Thanks for the answer, I have dark eyes as well so probably less noticeable. Yea I‚Äôve been overthinking it a lot, i should care less."
Side effects freaking me out?,"Definitely communicate these symptoms with your doctor. But water with electrolytes are pretty essential. What time are you taking your meds? Depending on that, may be the reason it's affecting your sleep...also if you're drinking caffeinated beverages, stop."
Side effects freaking me out?,I usually take them at 7-8am and i think i might invest in some electrolytes
Side effects freaking me out,"I‚Äôm about a week in as well. Some dry mouth but not as bad as my brief stint on Concerta. Drinking plenty of water w/ electrolytes and having cough drops on hand have helped. 

My sleep hasn‚Äôt been the best either. Nights when I only take 2.5 mg melatonin I wake up at 3 and have a hard time falling back asleep. Nights where I have that plus 1 Benadryl I‚Äôm sleeping well. Not a long term solution in my book. But I‚Äôve got to get some sleep! 

One annoying side effect, that i believe has to be linked to Vyvanse, is acne. I never deal with acne. Not since I was a teenager (I‚Äôm mid 40s) But I‚Äôve got multiple spots on my nose. Pretty annoying!

Hoping things settle down for you!"
Side effects freaking me out,"i started on 30mg, i‚Äôm at my preferred dose of 60mg now. the first few weeks i dealt with dry mouth, like suuuper noticeable. after about 4-5 months now, it‚Äôs definitely gone away for the most part, though i‚Äôve also upped my water intake a lottt. only time i notice it is if i‚Äôm talking for a long time lol. sugar free gum helps, just keeps saliva producing in my mouth. (dentist recommended sugar free because dry mouth = less natural production of important bacteria in saliva). there‚Äôs also certain mouthwashes and even tablets that are specifically for dry mouth that helps. 

as for sleep, i‚Äôve always averaged less sleep than the average person (about 6 hours my body just wakes up). since beginning vyvanse, it‚Äôs definitely decreased to around 5 some nights, which does suck. if i desperately need sleep, melatonin works for me personally, but i try not to take it too frequently. i also have sleepy tea many days of the week which i‚Äôve found helps a little."
Side effects freaking me out,"More or less every medication gives me dry mouth  - not just the adhd meds. It's gone away with some but not others.
The TheraBreath lozenges are the best thing I've come up with. Whatever you use, make sure it is sugar-free. Also be aware that xylitol is very toxic to dogs so be sure to keep the package inaccessible if you have pets. 
Also, as much water as you can manage."
Side effects freaking me out,Omg   Look at the positives   So many people complain prob because they are actually NOT ADHD to begin with
Side effects freaking me out,"I posted this above, but wanted to make sure you saw it as well. ‚ò∫Ô∏è My doctor prescribed a low dose of Clonidine to take before bed. It helps relax the Vyvanse ""awakeness"" so that I can fall asleep and stay asleep. It has been a game changer for my sleep."
Side effects freaking me out,"My doctor prescribed a low dose of Clonidine to take before bed. It helps relax the Vyvanse ""awakeness"" so that I can fall asleep and stay asleep. It has been a game changer for my sleep."
Side effects freaking me out,"This is my own hangup, but, I don‚Äôt love the idea of prescription meds. Yes, I know I‚Äôm taking some now and I believe they‚Äôre helping. But there‚Äôs still a part of me that really wants to run the other way from all of this stuff. And I just don‚Äôt like the idea of chasing side effects from drugs with other drugs. Which then might have their own side effects. It‚Äôs probably an ingrained reaction from watching my father being on 20 different meds, many trying to solve side effects from other drugs. It just gets so convoluted!? 

I am glad that you‚Äôre finding that to be helpful. If things with my sleep don‚Äôt resolve I‚Äôll probably suck it up and talk to my doctor about options. All the best to you!"
Anxiety when starting new Vyvanse/Elvanse dose (40mg),I had to quit coffee to get rid of jitters and stress/angsty behavior. I suspect any other brain altering chemical you‚Äôre on might also affect the side effects
Anxiety when starting new Vyvanse/Elvanse dose (40mg),Hmm‚Ä¶ this is what I‚Äôm thinking. I‚Äôve only JUST started the new dose today so here‚Äôs hoping it‚Äôs just adjustment and not much else. ü§ûüèª
Anxiety when starting new Vyvanse/Elvanse dose (40mg),"By the way, ChatGPT is super good at explaining the interconnectedness of drugs if you use the new version and keep digging at mechanistic biological explanations between them.

It‚Äôs just really for reassurance that it might pass than anything else. üòÖ
Update: the jitters have gone away for the most part. Just dry mouth. :)"
My body craves food so much,"i really relate to this. ¬†i find that eating actual meat protein makes me feel so mcuh better, shakes just dont feel like they count but if i eat a load of chicken it really fills me and lasts. also even before i restarted taking elvanse i had such weird hunger cues, or lack thereof, turned out i was deficient in multiple things like vitamin d iron and b12. ¬†but i had to do the detective work myself bc doctors are so uneducated and told me i was fine when my iron levels were blatantly deficient¬†"
My body craves food so much,"i‚Äôve experienced somewhat similar symptoms when i first started vyvanse. i am a bottomless pit without my meds that will eat all the time because i am bored and need stimulation but also because my appetite is genuinely crazy. i weight lift/work-out four days a week but i am a 22f but i eat like a teenage boy with a constant growth spurt. 

i am sorta jealous of others having appetite suppression, but at least i have the impulse control not to eat constantly. however i am snacking every 2-3 hours lmao. 

make sure you‚Äôre keeping your blood sugar stable and eating a huge amount of protein in the morning. i recommend getting some protein bars because they‚Äôre dense enough to keep you full and give you an boost. also, around your menstrual cycle, be aware of changes. your medicine will likely not work as well or at all. you‚Äôll likely be even more lethargic because the vyvanse already drains some of your nutrients like magnesium. i recommend pepcid or a magnesium supplement :)"
My body craves food so much,"Hey, I just read your edit and that might be the case, but I would consult with your prescriber about your symptoms still. Kinda sounds like Vyv might be causing unstable blood sugar levels or exacerbation of hyperthyroidism, which sounds a bit like what you‚Äôre experiencing. I‚Äôm not a health professional, but might be worth bringing it up to your specialist. Also, did they get you to submit blood work and did they review it before getting you started on it?"
My body craves food so much,"I switched to heavy fat/protein content food-wise rather than carbs, and my stability, food intake and concentration improved a lot."
My body craves food so much,Same here. But it's not an issue since now I have the focus and the energy to be productive and work our every day. I am also in the best shape of my life.
My body craves food so much,"You should take multivitamins‚Ä¶.. you are probably deficient in A,B Complex, Vitamin D, magnesium, zinc, iron, and potassium‚Ä¶. This will help you solve a lot of these problems you are having"
My body craves food so much,"I‚Äôve been on Vyvanse for 3 years now and can relate to this completely. It‚Äôs almost like vyvanse uses up more energy for me so I need to eat more? But I used to never have breakfast in the morning, and now I wake up every morning starving. And will also feel starving by lunch and by dinner, and usually need to snack in between!! I take multivitamins everyday aswell. I wonder if vyvanse can help speed up our metabolism maybe, I‚Äôm not sure? But I definitely need to eat a lot more and a lot more consistently."
My body craves food so much,When I forget to take Vyvanse for one day I literally eat everything üò≠
My body craves food so much,"I genuinely eat so much less now I‚Äôm on Elvanse (Vyvanse) and have lost about 4kg in the past 2 months since starting but have noticed that when I do eat or crave food I can eat a humongous portion and then not want to snack or crave sugar like I used to. I probably eat the same amount as I used to in a day in one meal and then have basically cut out most of my snacking. 

I need to get a healthier routine and eat more regularly but with constant changing of shifts week in week out find it really hard to stick to anything."
My body craves food so much,"Definitely start eating more protein, especially at breakfast when you take your medication, to aid in keeping you fuller for longer. How much water do you drink as well? Sometimes thirst can manifest itself as hunger. 
I have the complete opposite problem where food is very unappealing at the moment üòÖ"
My body craves food so much,"When I first got prescribed this med, the doctor said ‚Äúyou won‚Äôt have to drink another cup of coffee for the rest of your life.‚Äù For some reason, I thought it sounded like the best thing ever at the time. I have diagnosed ADHD and have been tested multiple times for that diagnosis. 
I went off those meds after I started dating a guy in high school. I wanted to be with him so bad, so we stayed together for 3 years. I cared about him immensely, but I knew that we had to end it.
After I graduated college, I got diagnosed with MDD (major depressive disorder). I saw another psychiatrist who prescribed me Vyvanse again. It made me feel like I could finally go out into the world and do everything again.. But because I needed meds and my family knew I needed help, I stayed home (in the place I grew up), and did the things I loved. I played instruments (I got a music degree), and I made TikToks. One person commented something negative, so I took that as a sign to quit making content on there.
I made YouTube videos when I was younger so I started posting my stuff on there. I wrote and produced my own EP, in a house that I was house/dogsitting at. I‚Äôm so proud of that work because it‚Äôs the most accurate representation of how I feel.
I started working corporate jobs again after that. I got a full-time job at a bank, and I had a REALLY hard time there. I found everything to not make any sense, no matter how hard I tried. I went through a long & difficult trial-&-error period of antidepressants (since I was already taking 60 mg Vyvanse). I started vaping nicotine, and after that, I felt confident enough to put my 2 weeks in and get a new job. I found a job in my favorite field - A/V. I was an audiovisual technician and I‚Äôve always been really intuitive when it comes to technology, so I felt like I was in the right place with the right people. But I worked with mostly men, and I‚Äôm biologically female, so I felt like I needed to quit. I then put my 2 weeks in, over email. Since then, I‚Äôve been spending time with my family, and trying my best along the way.
I know this was a lot of information but I really truly hope this can help someone."
My body craves food so much,I had the same so I follow if someone can answer
My body craves food so much,yeah they did complete blood work and all that stuff and it came back perfect basically. I think itms improving slightly but idk tbh
My body craves food so much,the thing is I've been eating quite a bit more protein! I had some smoked salmon as a part of my breakfast which has a fair amount in it! I'm drinking loads of water right now as well haha
My body craves food so much,"Ahhh! That must be so frustrating. My advice would be to snack little and often as you‚Äôre already doing and just watch what you‚Äôre eating. 
Also, good choice of breakfast üòé"
I'm thinking of switching to Ritalin... ,20 is REALLY low. Upping it will make it last long or you can add an adderal booster to it?
I'm thinking of switching to Ritalin... ,"Either too low, or you need a second 20mg later in the day. This is very solvable :)"
I'm thinking of switching to Ritalin... ,"I guess your dose is too low and hydration is important, maybe no coffee cause that produce a crash on its own.

I take 50mg when i wake up and 2-3h later i take 20mg, this works the best, 70mg at one was too much and under 50mg i also crashed in midday.

Talk to your doc, but from my experience elvanse is 100 times better then ritalin, it doesnt changes your peesonality so much."
I'm thinking of switching to Ritalin... ,Why would you switch to Ritalin if Vyvanse works? There are tons of things you can do. Also 20mg is nothing. Try upping it. Or asking for a booster.
I'm thinking of switching to Ritalin... ,"I used to go through the same shit, but tbh it was because I was overmedicated. Do you take any anti-depressants or anything else?"
I'm thinking of switching to Ritalin... ,My doctor just prescribed me am Adderall IR 5MG boost to take at noon
I'm thinking of switching to Ritalin... ,"If you increase your dose, it increases how long it lasts. That is what my psychiatrist told me, and that has been the case w/ me personally. 20mg is low. Have you tried 30 or anything higher?

I‚Äôm on 60mg and it lasts me 6ish hours. I also take 20mg Adderall booster around noon. You can try a higher dose to see if that helps. Or try 20mg upon waking up, and then take another 10mg or so a couple hours later to make it last longer and help the comedown. Last step would be to try an instant release booster to give you longer coverage."
I'm thinking of switching to Ritalin... ,"I used to have the same problem with my lower doses. My psych upped my dose (after doing the relevant tests; ECG and BP) and said it would help. She wasn‚Äôt wrong.. my dose lasts at least 8hrs now. I have long days (12-14hrs) because I‚Äôm studying and working so it‚Äôs still not ideal, but my body is still also getting used to the new strength. I have my next appointment in the next couple of months so not sure if she will be upping my dose again or just giving me toppers, but hope this insight helps :))"
I'm thinking of switching to Ritalin... ,"Your dose is one of the lowest doses you can get; it goes up to 70. I am at 30mg for a few weeks or someshit now and i'm getting about 4-6 hours. I don't get a crash, I wish I did, but I do get the dry mouth. I just don't feel the extreme focus part after 6 hours and I start to become forgetful/stupid again.  I will be upping my dose soon probably because of that.

I do think that the vyvanse is working even though i don't ""feel it."" Because I can sit for a long time, calmly, and work for 6ish hours after the super focus part wears off. Which is something I struggled with, before that.

It's very possible the dose is just low. If you bring it up to your doctor they may have you take double dose, or two in the same day or something or just increase it. I'd just talk to them before giving up. You didn't really mention anything bad here to just give up on it like that. If you told me you were suicidal while on vyvanse that's a different story; but you only said good things, outside of the duration.

Put it this way, if you get your dose right and the effective duration increases, and you crash at an appropriate time, is it such a problem?"
I'm thinking of switching to Ritalin... ,Not lasting long enough sounds like a low dose. Try 50-60
I'm thinking of switching to Ritalin... ,My daughter is on 30mg Vyvanse after 20mg only working for 2-4 hours. I‚Äôm on 50mg and it last maybe 6-8ish hours on a good day. Just go up on your dose instead of changing a med you know works well
I'm thinking of switching to Ritalin... ,"20mg lasted 6hr for me, 30mg lasts 10-12 hrs. Try upping your dose!"
I'm thinking of switching to Ritalin... ,"How long have you been taking it? It's possibly it could be the dose is too low, but it's also possible it could be too high. üòÖ

My Dr started me at 10mg and it felt great at first, but I titrated up too quickly and I thought it was wearing off too quickly a few hours in. I was irritable and confused/disorganized, and hyperfocusing on the wrong things with little ability to tear myself away. I stopped taking it and switched to biphentin (ritalin) because I didn't like the irritability.

The biphentin was horrible for me. I felt like I was moving in slow motion and my body was so heavy. When I adjusted to that I thought maybe it was ok cause I was able to do some stuff with will power and not getting as sucked in to the wrong things. But before long my RSD got WAY worse and I was super depressed and self conscious.

I had a couple vyvanse left (10mg capsules) so I took one one day to see how it felt, now that I had felt the biphentin. I had the best day, so much energy and my confidence was way up! Second time around once I switched back I took it slower. And I noticed after a week and a half at 10mg when I went up to 20mg it was good the first day, but after a few days I knew it was the ""too much"" feeling again.

So I alternated between 10mg and 20mg each day until I adjusted to that (about another couple weeks) and then stuck to 20mg /day for a while. After a while I noticed it sometimes wasn't enough (I find intense cardio burns through it faster for example, and I was adapting) so I did the same thing with alternating between 20 and 30mg. I've been back on it for over 3 months now and I'm still at 30mg, some days only having 20mg if I feel I don't need the full 30 that day.

I'm using the water titration method now and it is SO much better!! I don't really feel the ""come-up"" all that much. I know when it is kicking in but it's more of like ok I feel like I can get up and start doing things and I WANT to! Vs the burst of energy I would get when I first started taking it, and when I had too much. I sometimes hyperfocus on the wrong things but I'm usually able to pull  myself away if I need to and I've been able to actually use a schedule! ü§Ø

With taking sips throughout the morning I find it feels so much smoother where I don't get the peaks in anxiety and increased heart rate, and it lasts longer because it is being processed over time vs all at once. Before this I was taking 2 capsules in the morning and one around noon. Now I empty 2 capsules into a marked waterbottle in the morning, shake it up, and drink a few decent sips right away. Then I sip while getting ready until I've had 10mg. The other 10 I will drink until around 10/11. Then usually I will add water and another capsule around 11/12 and drink that over the next hour or two, depending what I have going on that evening. I haven't had issues falling asleep so this way won't work for everyone but it does for me! I find I'm getting tired around the time I want to go to sleep.

So yea devils advocate lol since it affects everyone so differently I wanted to mention this possibility. I have seen many others commenting in this sub that they had very similar experiences of feeling like it was wearing off around 2-4 hours in and trying to up their dosage, only to discover it was actually from having too much. It shouldn't feel like a buzz/manic type thing like coffee, when I'm at the right dose I just feel good. Content, but able to do things without having to mentally berate myself or get an adrenaline rush from a tight deadline. Just... functional!! Lol"
I'm thinking of switching to Ritalin... ,Can you ask for a higher dose - higher lasts longer and magnesium is meant to help
I'm thinking of switching to Ritalin... ,"I have to split my dose because it also doesn‚Äôt last long enough for me! I take 30mg first thing in the morning with a big protein breakfast, then 20mg with my lunch. I also have a matcha green tea about 2 hours after with a snack which really helps to extend the effects and also stops me from crashing."
I'm thinking of switching to Ritalin... ,Ritalin is more addictive and make me overexcited. Move up the dosage
I'm thinking of switching to Ritalin... ,"Drink a lot of water (much more than you think you need!)
Eat more protein and rich fiber food (good advice for everyone, especially for adhd)

And I tried and still use L-theanine 200mg and it helped me to reduce ‚Äúbusy mouth‚Äù under vyvanse and even if I have dry mouth I don‚Äôt feel it as unpleasant. If I feel something unpleasant (some kind of jittery in my body) I take the second L-theanine 200mg pill. Usually people just take on 500mg pill, but I prefer to split it (and I was onky able to order 200mg package, but drinking two capsule in the beginning of a day feels a bit less effective)"
I'm thinking of switching to Ritalin... ,"That's odd I find it lasts long for me. Like sometimes i notice isually even notice an everning boost. Maybe it's the way your metabolism/liver is processing it? I rea that magnesium hydroxate from Roland's can prolong amphetamine chemical? And yes, I noticed all those benefits too - even the anxiety reduction (which is odd since it's a stimulant)

But warn you if u switch to Ritalin, it may not be effective or may be anxious type of feeling or side effects etc. Ritalin is typically the most short acting stimulant, unless u consider an extended version like Concerta. Still taking a big gamble imo.

Have u suggested maybe requesting your Dr to prescribe a short acting adderall or dexedrine ""booster"". That request may get denied, but it's worth a try (if u feel comfortable with asking) . Good luck.!"
I'm thinking of switching to Ritalin... ,"Ask your Dr. If you could take another 20 after few hours and maybe ever third one later. If it doesn't affect your sleep. 
Or 1-2 5mg dex shorter acting boosters maybe lunch time and one later in the afternoon.
I find it better to divide doses than taking more at once. Bigger dose just affects too much very fast, goes away quickly and crash is worse.
But everyone is different. You just have to try what works for you."
I'm thinking of switching to Ritalin... ,"i ask my doctor to never recommend this to me. years ago i share an apartment with a girl, she tried to üíÄ-self as the ritalin anxiety was over her control when she was on it and after when the effects was passing the depression kicked hard af. watching everything happening and could do nothing else but support her was terrible and traumatizing. her family support her on a rehab and treatment for 5 months or so"
I'm thinking of switching to Ritalin... ,"Thank you all for your comments! 
Yesterday I was at the office of my psychiatrist and he prescribed me Vyvanse 30 MG. but my pharmacy didn't have the 30MG of Vyvanse available so they gave me a generic from the company:""Ratiopharm"". I tried it today but it doesn't work for me... I mean, yeah, it reduces my hyperactivity even more than the 20mg from Vyvanse, but it doesn't increase my focus (dopamine) at all. I went to my psychiatrist's office today again and told him my problem. He told me that there is a delivery bottleneck for Vyvanse. He told me to come back next week on Friday if the generic doesn't work until then still. I called my local pharmacy after that and they told me that they've got some packs of 30 mg of ""the normal Vyvanse"" and they also got one single pack of Vyvanse adult. My psychiatrist can also prescribe me the normal Vyvanse, that won't make a difference to me then. But yeah... I'll tell him that my local pharmacy got Vyvanse and that he should please prescribe me it"
I'm thinking of switching to Ritalin... ,"I tackle the crash by taking an antihistamine alongside it. Don‚Äôt ask me how, but it works. I‚Äôve always taken anti histamines but for the 5 days I didn‚Äôt take them I had the comedown of all comedowns every day where I was an emotional wreck and absolutely exhausted, irritable, etc. As soon as I started taking my antihistamines again the crashing stopped. Maybe try it. Avoid Benadryl and try cetirizine.

Also, for the record, I started on 20 and my psych put me up to 30 after 6 weeks. 20 was working great but it started to fade at a similar time as you. They‚Äôre more likely to up the dose than move you to Ritalin. I was on Ritalin before this and it was awful."
I'm thinking of switching to Ritalin... ,"Nah, I don't take anything besides Vyvanse.... Maybe my dose is too low? I'm on 20 mg"
I'm thinking of switching to Ritalin... ,"Also, I take magnesium and L theanine for the comedown. Drink lots of water too, and electrolytes. It also helps w/ the comedown."
I'm thinking of switching to Ritalin... ,What dose
I'm thinking of switching to Ritalin... ,I do the same a 30 mg in morning then around 10am 10mg adderal Then 30mg  around 1pm then 10mg Adderall around 5pm. I was amazed my insurance pays for 60 pills a month
I'm thinking of switching to Ritalin... ,I went from 20 to 30 recently and it make a huge difference. I am taking 20 in the morning and 10 around 2pm (I work late).
I'm thinking of switching to Ritalin... ,Talk to your doctor about adjusting your dose. I was prescribed 50mg the first time I took it.
I'm thinking of switching to Ritalin... ,Started off at 30mg
I'm thinking of switching to Ritalin... ,I mean what did you up to
I'm thinking of switching to Ritalin... ,"Oh, I upped to 50mg"
Is this lack of appetite going to affect my health‚Ä¶.?,"There are some over-the-counter and prescribed options that can help with appetite suppression caused by Vyvanse. When I was on a combination of antidepressants and Vyvanse, I also experienced severe hunger, but it became overwhelming after a while. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend the approach I used to take, as it made me feel constantly tired and unmotivated, even though I wasn‚Äôt actually sleeping. It was a tough experience, to say the least.

Based on what I‚Äôve learned, I‚Äôd suggest trying to find another stimulant or adjusting the current one in a way that reduces appetite suppression. There are some alternatives that might have less of an impact on hunger, and this could be worth discussing with a doctor."
Is this lack of appetite going to affect my health‚Ä¶.?,"At this moment I can't read all replies, but I was the same with my appetite. I'm not 6 months in, my appetite came back. . However,
Even when my appetite was mostly gone. I still maintained . I can still go long with out eating,  but I could eat. It's just easier for me to go longer. 

Your metabolismay be different, I would speak to your medical professional."
Is this lack of appetite going to affect my health‚Ä¶.?,"70mg after a few months is pretty nuts, and I say that as someone who takes 70mg. 

Are you a huge dude? Was this a switch from another drug?"
Is this lack of appetite going to affect my health‚Ä¶.?,"I‚Äôm the same way. I‚Äôm on 30mg and thinking I might have to stop taking it because of this. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù and currently 123ish trying desperately to gain weight, so yes, it is definitely going to affect your health. It‚Äôs been 3ish months and my appetite is still gone. (Which really sucks on Thanksgiving day‚Ä¶)"
Is this lack of appetite going to affect my health‚Ä¶.?,I lost and maintained for the first year or two. Then I started gaining again. It‚Äôs pretty common.
Is this lack of appetite going to affect my health‚Ä¶.?,Not if you're obese
Is this lack of appetite going to affect my health‚Ä¶.?,"If you are having that much appetite loss you should go down in dose. For me (prescribed 60mg of adderall, equal to 140mg of vyvanse) Keep in mind I‚Äôm a fast metabolizer of meds. 70mg of vyvanse would only get me 5-6 hours. I do definitely have appetite loss. But I can work around it. Usually it just means I don‚Äôt have much for lunch. I make sure to get in a good breakfast and a couple of lite snacks throughout the day. Banana, yogurt, peanut butter crackers. At night I‚Äôll have a big dinner. The loss of appetite did get better for me after a couple of months. When I started meds 2 years ago I was 185 pounds. I went down to 165 lbs within the first 4 months. Been stable ever since. I needed to shed that weight anyways. That‚Äôs just my experience and understanding. Talk to the doctor. Might want to go down in dose for a little while. Hope this helps. 

Edit. I also take 2 days off a week and basically binge eat to make up for days that I skip out on calories."
Is this lack of appetite going to affect my health‚Ä¶.?,I take zoloft too and I‚Äôll get these like 5 minute completely overwhelming severe hunger that make me feel faint and then boom it‚Äôs gone. üò≠üò≠ it‚Äôs like the two meds are fighting against each other lol. I didn‚Äôt know there were things you could get otc for appetite! Tysm I‚Äôll look into it and o probably need to adjust my meds around a little
Is this lack of appetite going to affect my health‚Ä¶.?,What are the OTC options?
Is this lack of appetite going to affect my health‚Ä¶.?,"The thing is any lower I go I just dont get any of the intended effects of the medication. Honestly ive had zero appetite no matter how low the dose, same thing happened with dexies‚Ä¶üò≠üò≠ I wonder if it‚Äôs just my body‚Ä¶even taking 30mg I felt no effects as if I wasn‚Äôt even taking any medication but my appetite was STILL gone"
Is this lack of appetite going to affect my health‚Ä¶.?,Exactly how I feel in the morning before I take my meds
Is this lack of appetite going to affect my health‚Ä¶.?,"I have a sneaking suspicion that the reason you need to increase the dose is BECAUSE you don‚Äôt eat enough. You‚Äôre on a dangerous path of compensating for lack of nutrition by increasing the use of stimulants. It would likely be much better and healthier to decrease the dose and FEED YOUR BRAIN rather than just dumping enough adrenaline into your system to make it kick into emergency mode and brute force it to perform. 

Feed your body first. Then reconsider if you need to increase your dose."
Is this lack of appetite going to affect my health‚Ä¶.?,"I hear you. Even when I take 10mg of adderall I won‚Äôt want to eat. I‚Äôve just gotten into the habit of eating even if I don‚Äôt want to. I always have a big breakfast. A bowl of cereal just won‚Äôt cut it. I take the immediate release adderall. So every 3-4 hours when I take my dose, I‚Äôll eat something. When I first started vyvanse the thought of food would make me gag."
Is this lack of appetite going to affect my health‚Ä¶.?,"If I‚Äôm not feeling breakfast I‚Äôll put protein powder in a blender. Use 1/2 milk, 1/2 water. A banana and a big tablespoon of peanut butter. I‚Äôll take that with my meds. Having a breakfast with a lot of protein and fats has helped me a lot. You could also pack some snacks and set some alarms to have one every couple of hours."
Is this lack of appetite going to affect my health‚Ä¶.?,Uh oh üò≠üò≠üò≠ I really am trying it just feels impossible‚Ä¶it‚Äôs like when I‚Äôm medicated I can finally do everything EXCEPT eat
Is this lack of appetite going to affect my health‚Ä¶.?,U do more when ur not feeling breakfast than I do when I am. Props to u.¬†
Is this lack of appetite going to affect my health‚Ä¶.?,"How about breakfast? I know it can be hard, but it‚Äôs before the medicine starts. Eat as much as you can of nutrient and energy dense food as breakfast. Fat and meat. 

I eat 2 eggs with mayo and salt. It‚Äôs not a lot, but it nutrient dense and gives me some fat and minerals. 

If you can prepare something the day before and get it into your system before the drug takes hold, it could mean a world of difference."
Is this lack of appetite going to affect my health‚Ä¶.?,Trying so hard to eat it but I normally have 30 minutes between waking up and leaving for work üò≠ I need structure in my life again lol
Is this lack of appetite going to affect my health‚Ä¶.?,"For a period I would set my alarm to 5 AM, take the medicine, go back to sleep. When I woke up 1,5 hours later I was super prepared to have an awesome morning and found time and energy to get breakfast and personal hygiene done properly. After a month that routine had set and I went back to taking it when I woke up. Hope it helps, and good luck!!"
I started a week ago after being diagnosed at 45,"I thought my adhd was depression as well. I was chasing my depression issues on my own since my teens because I couldn't afford to go to a doctor, and I was afraid of antidepressants turning me into a crazy person.   I learned all the bullshit and read all the books about depression. I was constantly on this cycle of getting depressed and trying to claw my way out of it and know how to do it, for the most part. So I never got checked out.

I found out I had adhd when I was playing a game and YouTube autoplayed into a lecture about what untreated ADHD looks like (video is called ""The Shame of ADHD"") and they were literally speaking my life. I was fortunate to hear a part that grabbed my attention while focused on the game. After that I sat and researched it for a few months and sure enough that was my problem the entire time. I got diagnosed at 33, like 4 months ago.

I got super lucky, honestly. If I went into the doctor without the understanding from my research that I for sure had adhd, they surely would have put me on antidepressants and it wouldn't have solved my problem. And I would have gone through every antidepressant they have.  They assumed it was something else trauma/depression related.  They were offering me anxiety/antidepressant medication like it was candy. But when it came to the adhd meds, that was a nightmare to get done. It took 8 months"
I started a week ago after being diagnosed at 45,Same here. 65 and dxd w BP2 at 50. I am pissed off! I‚Äôm on Lamictal but no other BP meds. I moved and my new psychiatrist vehemently disagreed w my dx and started me on Vyvanse. I calmed right down.
I started a week ago after being diagnosed at 45,Good for you i went through the mill of anti depressants but also anto psychotic medication for it. When I am badly inattentive 9/9 and 6/9 hyperactive with ADHD i had to wait for meds lisdex. What are you on? And are you feeling better?
I started a week ago after being diagnosed at 45,"I'm on Wellbutrin 75mg (it's not doing anything for me, will probably stop this one) and 30mg vyvanse and a blood pressure med. 

The 30mg vyvanse did a lot for me. For the first time i could sit calmly with no racing thoughts. But after a few weeks I'm not getting a good duration so I probably need an increase. But still overall it's been positive. I'm getting good sleep but it's difficult to fix the sleeping schedule. Its mostly my fault.  I made the mistake of taking it at 1pm when I started out lol. Unfortunately I do not get the crash that everyone gets."
I started a week ago after being diagnosed at 45,"Why didn't you stay on the 30mg and go up accordingly? 60mg would be good with Wellbutrin 150mg 2x a day.

That is my plan."
I started a week ago after being diagnosed at 45,"I am not interested in increasing the welbutrin because of the potential side effects. Personally I have seen 0% benefit from the welbutrin so i'm thinking it's not necessary to continue trying it at a higher dose and potentially needing to deal with withdrawals and side effects that i don't currently have. 

As for the vyvanse its doing everything I need it to, it's just the duration. I feel amazing when it's at it's most potent, but it's becoming more and more short lived"
I started a week ago after being diagnosed at 45,"I am doing what I can to make my 40mg Vyvanse last too.
I can‚Äôt do 50mg. Just doesn‚Äôt feel as ‚Äúcalm‚Äù."
self esteem increase?,"Yeah, vyvanse helps my self-esteem. I imagine it's the lack of dopamine from ADHD that gives you lower self esteem, you feel crappy all the time and that effects your self-esteem. But then you take vyvanse brings your dopamine to normal levels, you don't feel so strung out and bad"
self esteem increase?,"My self esteem became normal for the first time in my life after I started taking those meds. It was awful before cbt, became just unstable (hit or miss) after cbt. First week on meds - it‚Äôs totally normal."
self esteem increase?,Yes it helps mine too!
self esteem increase?,it helps mine too! I experience less ruminating negative thoughts and just generally feel more self-assured
Just prescribed Vyvanse,"I just started last week and i‚Äôm having some of the same feelings/questions about it. You‚Äôre on day 1, maybe tomorrow will be different. I‚Äôm on day 5 and tbh every day has been a little different, two of the days I did feel the improved executive function effects, the other days not much other than being a little energetic/restless and having dry mouth. Give it another shot, tomorrow is a new day. My psychiatrist told me that I should keep a little journal about it between that day and our next appointment (a month out, and i have a month‚Äôs supply), notes on any other variables (like with food vs without food, amount of sleep, stuff like that), and how i felt throughout the day. She said i could take some ‚Äúoff‚Äù days to see how it compares (and avoid tolerance), but should mostly have ‚Äúon‚Äù days for more data points. It seems to be a very individual thing how a person reacts, so keeping a log/journal is probably a good move."
Just prescribed Vyvanse,"Thank you, this is helpful!"
I recently got prescribed Vyvanse. ,"I currently take 60mg and have been on it for about 2 yrs. First things first: hydrate. Vyvanse (at least for me) makes me sweat 2x as much and it definitely takes its toll if I don‚Äôt consciously drink water and electrolytes. Second: it tends to hit your stomach better and work more consistently if you eat before you take your meds. Especially protein rich foods. In my experience if I wait to eat, I never end up eating breakfast or lunch and I feel terrible by the time I eat dinner. Which leads me to my third thought: your appetite and taste in foods may change. Things I never thought I‚Äôd consistently crave( take out, fast food, junk food, processed snacks) are sometimes the only thing I can stomach because my normal go to meals don‚Äôt taste the same anymore. It‚Äôs really hard to explain and it might just be me but something to think about. Best of luck!"
I recently got prescribed Vyvanse. ,"Don‚Äôt drink coffee or energy drinks. Eat protein for breakfast. Carry a water bottle and if it is empty then fill it. You should drink a lot of water. 

It‚Äôs going to be a very good day, enjoy!"
I recently got prescribed Vyvanse. ,Thank you!
side effects coming and going depending on day,"It sounds like it's really doing nothing for you at all. Is it actually doing anything for the ADHD symptoms? If it is, maybe a lower dose might be an idea because it sounds like it's knocking your brain around. Defo go speak to your doc about this."
side effects coming and going depending on day,"i tried lower doses working up to 40s 10,20,30 all for a week each, below 30 i don‚Äôt feel anything 30 and up it‚Äôs all the same to me"
side effects coming and going depending on day,I‚Äôd say try going back to 30. Sounds like it‚Äôs just a sliver too high as the fogginess shouldn‚Äôt be a factor if you have eaten and are otherwise able to do things you don‚Äôt want to do. How long have you been on it? It took about 2 months before I started feeling ‚Äúnormal‚Äù on my dose. I got started at 30mg.
Vyvanse Poop,Oatmeal
Vyvanse Poop,"Ya know I like my 12 grain bread (or any multi whole grain bread honestly)for morning fiber, also gets in a good chunk of protein."
Vyvanse Poop,Just bland oatmeal or can you have the flavored oatmeal?  How well does it work?
Vyvanse Poop,"You just need a high fiber breakfast regularly. Any kind of oatmeal will work. I have some high fiber chocolate milk type drink‚Ä¶ works well in a hurry.  

Regular fiber in your diet will make you regular. Might not work day 1, but keep it up and it‚Äôll straighten out. Next thing you know it, you‚Äôll take med in the morning, have a cup of coffee, and clear out the backlog on a regular schedule."
So much sweat. So much.,"I know this may not be the most practical answer, but ive dealt with the sweating for almost 10 years. Secret clinical (helps) but i now get Botox in my armpits to help with some of it. I know there is probably mixed feelings about this, but as someone with a job interacting with other humans on a daily bases it has really helped me."
So much sweat. So much.,"Me too. The meds make me tense, I hold my arms super tight to my body when I‚Äôm focused which leads to sweating, I‚Äôm also now extremely temperature sensitive. I get cold fingers and toes at times to the point where I feel like I can‚Äôt type, other times I‚Äôm covered in sweat (even behind my knees!) but I am always running hot. They raise your body temperature and increase heart rate. I will be doing the dishes and need to take off my hoodie. I notice my hair and skin get greasy a lot quicker as well. I‚Äôd recommend a zip up hoodie to be able to take off when hot and put on when cold with ease, and a loosely fitted t-shirt."
Vyvanse and morning/afternoon nausea?,Might just be dehydration? Even if you're not on meds and dehydrated that alone can cause nausea. Drink a ton of water throughout the day or an electrolyte type drink too.
Vyvanse and morning/afternoon nausea?,I feel rough if I don't eat healthily during the morning. How's your nutrition?
Vyvanse and morning/afternoon nausea?,Are you taking anything other than vyvanse
Vyvanse and morning/afternoon nausea?,you need to eat before or right after taking it
Intense eyes with Vyvanse,"I cant explain it, but feel same way"
Intense eyes with Vyvanse,Something I‚Äôve experienced w this drug is that it can cause you to become overly preoccupied with your internal experience (I.e. not as responsive to external factors as you‚Äôd like to be in social situations).
Intense eyes with Vyvanse,"Honestly, you explain exactly how I feel and how I reacted to meds. Not only that we have the same fear. I know this isn‚Äôt gonna help you what I‚Äôm about to say but I remember one day I decided to just be more open and just hold a conversation while actually making eye contact. I went on a date recently went really well but she suddenly joked and said something like I had crazy eyes‚Ä¶. Ngl this made me so insecure because that day I realised it‚Äôs noticeable and people might think I‚Äôm on ‚Äúcoke‚Äù"
Intense eyes with Vyvanse,"Also, don‚Äôt quit taking meds if it really helps you with everything. Unless this is really bothering you or straining on your mental health and well being"
Intense eyes with Vyvanse,"I already have naturally large, dark pupils, on this med they magnify even more. Add to that I have small eyes so my eyes are pretty much 80% dark pupils. I look like I was drawn by a toddler.¬†"
Intense eyes with Vyvanse,"its just meth, vyv its just a little legal dose of meth imo"
Intense eyes with Vyvanse,"Yea I can see that. Is there someway to get rid of that? 
I also get irritated sometimes later during the day. That‚Äôs annoying as well. 

I‚Äôam a business owner for video company and I will have a big production in 2 days where I will need to interview people and direct a film. I will meet them at the morning so it will be fine. But later during the day I‚Äôm worried I might get angry.

I heard that eating protein can help.
Do you have any thoughts on that?"
Intense eyes with Vyvanse,"Concerning the anger, I‚Äôve found that snacking throughout the day is immensely helpful. Vyvanse acts as an appetite suppressant, no matter what you were prescribed it for. It helps you focus and clear your mind a lot, but if you‚Äôre not eating enough, it could make you feel a little out of touch with the things around you. This is my experience, and what has helped me before"
Do I need a re-diagnosis to start ADHD meds?,Yes
Vyvanse strattera combo not going well,"Try lowering your Vyvanse dose, it's pretty common to not need as high of a stimulant dosage on combination therapy."
Vyvanse strattera combo not going well,Yeah I was thinking I might cut it to half tomorrow
Vyvanse strattera combo not going well,"The big upside is that Strattera seems to be really effective for you, if you don't get any side effects from it and pairing it with Vyvanse is just too strong overall even with a lowered dose, you could potentially get full symptom coverage from just Strattera with the added benefit of a 24/7 effect and no more crashes or shitty days from stimulant breaks if you do those."
weird perception of touch and fingers ,Omg YES finally someone put it into words for me lol what you said 100% is how I get. Same when I hit my vuse and cart!! Im on 60mg tho!
weird perception of touch and fingers ,Omg someone answered!!! Yes! It‚Äôs really really annoying! I work in kitchens so I should be handy and my motor skills should not be impaired. It‚Äôs really frustrating and makes me trip the fuck out ! At least I am not alone lol
weird perception of touch and fingers ,Dude that‚Äôs literally crazy cause I DO TOO!! KM here of a line! I do promise you get use to it more and I‚Äôm still able to do it well now! I totally thought I was alone too! I always remind myself that it‚Äôs just in my head and that helps it at times too ü´∂üèª
weird perception of touch and fingers ,"Damn that‚Äôs really crazy! I stopped line cooking a few years ago and am now just part time employed as a prep chef and go to college in the mean time, it‚Äôs great! 
Thanks for your kind words ! I hope I get used to it and I hope I can still enjoy my joint at night, this is such an important ritual for me, I don‚Äôt see myself stopping‚Ä¶ and yes it‚Äôs probably just in my head but it feels so fucking physical like it‚Äôs a neurological thing, u know ?"
Drinking on Vyvanse,You should be fine in moderation. The problems I've had when drinking on vyvanse were due to excess. It makes it harder to feel the buzz from drinking so its easy to overindulge when the fun wheel starts spinning. It has also caused spikes in my blood pressure twice due to overindulgence. Way to long at the bar because I didn't feel that tired. Also you get dehydrated way quicker it seems. Luckily I recognized very fast how it was effecting me and cut back a crapload compared to how I used to drink before medication. Ill still have up to a 6 pack on a weekend out and be fine though. Just practice moderation and stay hydrated.
Drinking on Vyvanse,"I don‚Äôt particularly like drinking alcohol when medicated, but it‚Äôs never been uncomfortable or led to any issues. I usually have a drink every two hours or so when medicated, so 3 drinks over an evening.

Heavy drinking where you drink continuously is another story. Vyvanse will mask the alcohol effect until you‚Äôre suddenly stupendously drunk. That‚Äôs the danger, not much else."
Drinking on Vyvanse,"You should be fine, just don‚Äôt over do it. Having one or two is fine but even if you don‚Äôt feel the effects of Vyvanse anymore, it does stay in your blood system for a really long time. And the Vyvanse counteract any alcohol so you might drink alcohol and not feel the same as you normally do if you drink without Vyvanse. You might feel like you‚Äôre not drunk or buzzed and then you might think that you should drink some more, but once the Vyvanse wears off, you‚Äôll really feel it! I‚Äôve learned that the hard way. So if you are going to do it, just stick to one or two drinks don‚Äôt go crazy."
Drinking on Vyvanse,"Personally, I noticed when I had a drink, it didn't make me feel well... Can't really explain... Just didn't feel good.. So now I don't drink... Occasionally I'll try again... And nope.. Still Don't feel well..."
Drinking on Vyvanse,I'm drinking on Vyvanse right now
Drinking on Vyvanse,"It‚Äôs fine if you have 1-2 drinks but anymore than that you‚Äôre treading in dangerous territory. I‚Äôve made a fool of myself because you are quite literally mixing uppers and downers. even if you think it‚Äôs completely worn off by night time, it‚Äôs not. The stimulants make you feel alert and awake so you don‚Äôt feel how drunk you‚Äôre getting. It‚Äôs easy to get out of control. I had some bad times in college before I learned to just stop"
Drinking on Vyvanse,I had a few drinks on vyvanse when i just started it.  Woke up in the Night with a resting heart rate of 162. I don‚Äôt drink anymore.
Drinking on Vyvanse,Alcohol and stimulants can do strange things. I‚Äôd be careful.  A beer is probably no problem. Maybe ask the doctor?
Drinking on Vyvanse,I have drank on it even basically right after taking it. Don‚Äôt recommend because you can‚Äôt feel yourself getting as drunk as you really are. I was fine until I was completely shitfaced and throwing up. Personally I‚Äôve done fine drinking after it‚Äôs basically already worn off though
Drinking on Vyvanse,I‚Äôve done this and had no adverse effects. Doesn‚Äôt even seem to affect how much I need to drink; it just feels like a normal drinking session.
Drinking on Vyvanse,"i always drink on vyvanse. when the vyvanse starts crashing i get really grumpy and antsy, and usually a beer or two solves that lol."
Drinking on Vyvanse,"I find it totally irresponsible and concerning that sone people on here are responding saying ‚Äòyou‚Äôll be fine‚Äô or ‚Äòit‚Äôs totally fine‚Äô. This is incredibly irresponsible because there is ABSOLUTELY no way these people can tell you that, they do not have a clue how you‚Äôll respond. Sone people may be ok doing it but I‚Äôve read literally hundreds of people say they felt awful/ had bad experiences doing it. So, although I totally respect when people share their own experiences saying it didn‚Äôt effect them‚Ä¶ NOBODY should be telling OP that ‚Äòthey will be fine‚Äô‚Ä¶. Its like‚Ä¶Seriously‚Ä¶ you actually think it‚Äôs ok to say that?!"
Drinking on Vyvanse,Thanks everyone! I‚Äôm taking 50mg. Will that make any difference?
Drinking on Vyvanse,"i‚Äôve(21f) never had problems drinking on vyvanse, but if you‚Äôre nervous about it just don‚Äôt drink a ton"
Drinking on Vyvanse,"I've been curious as well. I have had a few. And didn't. Price anything. I won't push it though, just in case"
Drinking on Vyvanse,I‚Äôm on Zoloft and about to start Vyvanse and I drink a lot so this was really worrying me too. I‚Äôm hoping the Vyvanse helps with the drinking
Drinking on Vyvanse,"For what it's worth, Vyvanse contributed to me largely quitting drinking; amongst other things, alcohol seems to negate Vyvanse if I'm on both, for me.  I prefer the benefit of the medication.  (Timing-wise this coincided with some personal events with close family, plus just greater awareness of long term health issues as well as stuff like the Hubermann alcohol episode)"
Drinking on Vyvanse,I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs harmless but I still do it and I‚Äôve been ok lol. Weird thing is I don‚Äôt have bad hangovers in the morning like I used to. Not sure if I‚Äôve been getting lucky or the vyvanse has anything to do with it.
Drinking on Vyvanse,You‚Äôre fine
Drinking on Vyvanse,"I‚Äôm on 40mg and I drink a few times a month. My doctor is aware and I haven‚Äôt noticed any negative responses from my body. I have 2 friends on 50mg and both drink very regularly (not saying that‚Äôs good just letting you know). 
I hope you can find a good balance and can enjoy come holiday cheer."
Drinking on Vyvanse,"Health wise, not the best. Feeling wise though? Stimulants and alcohol have gone hand in hand for ages."
Drinking on Vyvanse,It isn‚Äôt recommended to drink regularly while on Vyvanse. But going to a party or having drinks over the holidays won‚Äôt harm you. I still have drinks when I‚Äôm on my meds. It just may make you feel more depressed the next day and you may not feel the effects of the meds quite as much for a few days after depending on how much you‚Äôre drinking (I.e. having a few drinks vs. Getting wasted). But yea if it‚Äôs an occasional thing it‚Äôs fine. They just say that because they don‚Äôt want you to drink every day while on these meds.
Drinking on Vyvanse,"I was told I could drink in moderation. I went out with friends and had 2 sips of alcohol. Within 10 min I went from awake and aware, to extremely tired and completely out of it. I have only been taking it for about a month myself... But maybe try a bit before doing fully social? (My friends knew about my new meds and made sure I was ok the entire time and was like 3 ppl)"
Drinking on Vyvanse,"I can drink on it fine and I don‚Äôt feel like the effects are any less. If anything I‚Äôm more aware of the affects, as before medicating I had no stop button. I‚Äôd just keep drinking and drinking until I was either sick or comatose. But now I can comfortably have a couple and be done without this complete unawareness of my intake. But what I do find is my tablets are completely ineffective the next day. So for this reason I‚Äôve pretty much given up unless it‚Äôs a special occasion"
Drinking on Vyvanse,i‚Äôm kinda the same way when it comes to this. i drink in college and am fine. take it early in the morning and then drink once it‚Äôs more worn off at the end of the day if you‚Äôre really worried about it
Drinking on Vyvanse,"Ive been on Vyvanse for about 3 months and this has been my experience; When I started Vyvanse I found my body kind of rejected alcohol even in small amounts. I have a very sensitive body, so different drugs tend to really affect me and cause negative side effects. At the time it would make me feel nauseous, more anxious, increase my heart rate and make me feel totally off, and so I took over a month off from having even a sip of alcohol. Fast forward to now, my body has fully adjusted to the meds and I find I can happily enjoy a night out with multiple drinks, and not have to worry about any side effects! If anything I find Vyvanse makes me feel less intoxicated and if I‚Äôm crashing, I might be more inclined to reach for more alcohol. Be very careful of this because it could be a steep slope. Always be mindful of how much you‚Äôre consuming and match it with water to make sure you‚Äôre hydrated. Personally, unless I have projects I want to get done on the weekend, I usually like to take Sat and Sun off from my Vyvanse to be able to rest. I find when I‚Äôm hungover too I tend to be very anxious and exhausted, so taking the day off helps me, but there wouldn‚Äôt be anything wrong with you taking your meds the next morning. At the end of the day, everyone is very different, so it‚Äôs insanely important to listen to your body."
Drinking on Vyvanse,"I stopped drinking for the most part before I started meds, even though it's quite literally my job lol. I keep it that way for the most part, but I have an occasional drink here and there or take a sip of something when I have to know the taste or even a shot after a hard shift. I never drank a lot, legit never more than two glasses of like champagne or a few sips of something stronger. I don't really enjoy it much anymore in the first place, but it tends to give me a headache very quickly aaand I kinda feel buzzed faster?.. as well as feeling sick, as if I had too much. It's manageable with hydration and food helps too. Dunno if it's just cause I don't drink much in the first place, but this is still very atypical for me, so I think it is the mix of meds and alcohol affecting me.

Anyway... As always, everything in moderation. Just stay mindful of how you feel, even more so than usual. And if you don't wanna risk it, 'I take meds' is a good excuse and people tend not to ask much further."
Drinking on Vyvanse,"My advice is to take maybe half the dose that day and take it slowly with the drinking, the thing is when you take the meds and drink you're amplifying the side effects and minimizing the enjoyable effects.

About a month ago i had taken my meds in the morning and went out drinking in the evening, it was NOT a good idea, I have a naturally high tolerance to alcohol, so when I drink I have to drink alot to get drunk, i never black out or lose control and very rarely puke, but that day i felt so bad after drinking, i lost control of my body and when i sat i couldn't move or get up at all, i puked my guts out, and i think my blood pressure dropped alot, i ended up calling a friend to take me home, one of the worst nights of my life, never again!"
Drinking on Vyvanse,Totally fine to drink on. Good luck feeling the alcohol. Happy Thanksgiving ‚úåüèº‚ù§Ô∏èü§òüèº
Drinking on Vyvanse,"Same. For me, it feels like a hangover is starting as I am drinking and gets worse as I drink more.  I don‚Äôt drink any more either."
Drinking on Vyvanse,Wow that‚Äôs terrifying
Drinking on Vyvanse,"Came here to say this. Alcohol is a depressant and Vyvanse a Stimulant, basically opposite effects. I haven‚Äôt drank on Vyvanse but cocaine? Absolutely. I just never felt the alcohol as much until it was too late. BAC higher than I felt it in reality."
Drinking on Vyvanse,Yessss same. I often want some wine in the afternoon when it's wearing off and it helps bring my mood back up a bit. I'm trying to do better with that though haha
Drinking on Vyvanse,"Tbh you're taking medication for a reason, any foreign drug has influence dependant on a number of variables. We're trying to be healthy and happy, an occasional drink is ok but getting drunk can be problematic"
Drinking on Vyvanse,I take 50 daily and have 2-3 drinks every other day. M36
Drinking on Vyvanse,"I take 50mg in the morning and often have wine about 7hrs after taking it. Always fine. I only have like a bottle of wine over 5hrs though so I don't get drunk drunk, but I have gone out for a proper sesh with friends in the same time frame and also been fine :)"
Drinking on Vyvanse,"I take Lexapro too! I‚Äôve been taking 20mg of Lexapro for 10 years and I worry about combining meds because of my anxiety. But my doctor recommended vyvanse in the morning and I take my Lexapro at night. It‚Äôs been a game changer for my anxiety/ocd/panic disorder. Zoloft is an SSRI, it‚Äôs typically not recommended to take vyvanse with MAOI‚Äôs. If your doctor is recommending both, you‚Äôll be okay! Just ask your doctor about drinking too. I always prioritize my Lexapro over vyvanse (even though it‚Äôs typically not recommended to drink on Lexapro either) but I always take it before bed not WITH alcohol. I don‚Äôt drink a lot, just every now and then on the weekends because I‚Äôm enjoying my mid 20‚Äôs. I will say the vyvanse definitely lowers my craving to even want to drink."
Drinking on Vyvanse,"Oh and to add, Vyvanse is a stimulant so you won‚Äôt feel the effects of alcohol as fast as you normally do. So be aware of not over consuming. Keep track of how many drinks you‚Äôve had"
Drinking on Vyvanse,"Thank you! I typically don‚Äôt take it on the weekends, but sometimes things come up when I‚Äôve already taken it that morning. I have really bad health anxiety so I just freak out that something will happen to me (but this is me with literally everything) I appreciate it though and this made me feel better. I‚Äôm always a cautious and slow drinker."
Drinking on Vyvanse,It was more of my anxiety creeping in too I think and since I couldn‚Äôt check my blood pressure at home to see if any of my other vitals were wonky‚Ä¶ I had to bite the bullet and have the paramedics come ensure me I was okay (couldn‚Äôt do the 1.5 hour drive to ER had kiddos sleepin)
Drinking on Vyvanse,"hahah yeah same bc usually vyvanse suppresses my appetite so when i drink in the evening with not much food in my stomach, im kinda hungover in the morning lol"
Drinking on Vyvanse,You did the right thing.
Drinking on Vyvanse,"Oh I'm not actually haha. I drink a bottle of wine over about 5hrs if I do drink and I normally have a big dinner to compensate only having had a protein shake, banana, and wine. Do you not get hungry once it's worn off?"
Drinking on Vyvanse,Thank you that means a lot. I absolutely hate feeling like I am abusing the medical system
Drinking on Vyvanse,what wine do you drink? and i become absolutely feral when the vyvanse wears off but usually i‚Äôve accidentally fallen asleep by that time. lately i‚Äôve been waking up at like 3am bc i‚Äôm so hungry hahaha. i need to start eating like a normal human i guess lol.
Drinking on Vyvanse,"Just a ¬£5.50 pint grigio :) 11% usually.
Ooft yeah definitely get to eating better haha"
Drinking on Vyvanse,wait you‚Äôre in the uk? i thought vyvanse wasn‚Äôt available there? i‚Äôm in europe and not a soul has even heard of it.
Drinking on Vyvanse,"It's called elvanse here :) same drug, different name"
Drinking on Vyvanse,Where in Europe are you? That's a very broad term haha
Could a higher dose help the crash?,I would give it a month. That's what my Dr did. Take a month and check in.. so far so good 2 months on the same dose. How ever I supplement with coffee
Could a higher dose help the crash?,"How is your sleep, nutrition, caffeine intake and exercise? Any of those out of balance and Vyvanse will give hard crashes. It really does a lot better when general health is in a good place. 

But aside from the above, a higher dose will last longer. You could potentially ask for a booster dose instead if you don‚Äôt want a higher peak."
Could a higher dose help the crash?,"Check the generic manufacturer of your Vyvanse every time you get it filled. Oftentimes people are very sensitive to the different manufacturers; this is particularly true of meds that act on the CNS and especially those that are extended-release it seems. Vyvanse's extended-release mechanism doesn't rely on gut pH like most others do, but it's still susceptible to variation between manufacturers. Pharmacies often change generic manufacturers from time to time, especially now that these stimulants have been in shortage. I suppose they're simply getting what they can get at this point.

A lot of people have complained about generic Vyvanse doing this and have switched to brand-name for this reason. It's a lot more expensive that way as insurance usually won't cover brand-name meds when there is a generic available. Some people are *somehow* able to get it covered though, but it's still slightly more expensive this way.

Adding a second dose of Vyvanse in the middle of the day could possible help with the crash. A higher dose might actually *worsen* the crash as your blood levels would have a lot further to fall from a higher dose. Vyvanse is *supposed* to work for 10-12 hours, but this has proven not to be the case for everyone, especially with generic."
Could a higher dose help the crash?,I recently commented on another thread with someone having same issue. I was terribly dizzy and vertigo no matter what dose I had. From what I gathered it‚Äôs due to Vyvanse wearing off really quick. I was prescribed a dex booster of 5mg. I take it about an hr before my crash. Solves all my issues with crashing and no longer get dizzy. The booster doesn‚Äôt bring you back up it just levels the crash.
Could a higher dose help the crash?,"What time do you take it and what time do you crash? Depends how long the meds works for.

How long have you been on 20mg? You might be due to go up a dose."
Could a higher dose help the crash?,I am on 20mg and decided to try eating more slow digesting foods (whole wheat english muffins with peanut butter) this morning for breakfast and it definitely helped with not feeling such a crash after lunch.
Could a higher dose help the crash?,"You likely need to go up, yeah, if it feels intense give it 3-4 days to see how it levels out, as there's a huge difference between day 1 and day 7 of a new dose. If it ends up just not working out for you though, it's common to take a 2nd dose sometime around 5 hours after the first, which you can ask your doc about if your adhd symptom control is good on 20."
Could a higher dose help the crash?,I also wonder this - thinking about taking it slightly later in am to help? Or asking for split dose or dose increase!
Could a higher dose help the crash?,I‚Äôm currently moving from 40 to 50 to see!
Could a higher dose help the crash?,"No, it won‚Äôt help. The crash will always come; an increase is just going to put the crash off for another week or two.but after that couple weeks, the crash returns.

Finding a workable coping mechanism is the best advice I was given, and the best advice I can give after my own experience."
Could a higher dose help the crash?,"Sleep is hit or miss (5 hours last night), nutrition is good, I‚Äôve cut out caffeine and I‚Äôm fairly active. I wouldn‚Äôt really say I get proper exercise except for a couple hours on Monday evenings, but I‚Äôm studying at university and travelling around the campus requires quite a bit of walking."
Could a higher dose help the crash?,"Agree with everything here but thought I‚Äôd add my reactions to Vyvanse. Brand name, 50mg, 4-5hrs duration with terrible crash with extreme vertigo on comedown. Eat high protein lots of water, manual labour for work. 5mg dex booster at 4hr and 7hr mark. Resolved the moodiness and vertigo of my crash."
Could a higher dose help the crash?,It‚Äôs brand name Elvanse (I‚Äôm in the UK).
Could a higher dose help the crash?,I thought Vyvanse was meant to wear off slowly - doesn‚Äôt it have a half life of 12 hours?
Could a higher dose help the crash?,"I take it at around 8-9am and tend to start experiencing a crash around 7-8 hours later, which lasts a few hours. I‚Äôve only been on 20mg for 6 days, so I get things are likely to change."
Could a higher dose help the crash?,I don‚Äôt really feel a crash after lunch. It‚Äôs usually a few hours later. I‚Äôve been having overnight oats for breakfast which is super easy as I can prepare the night before in 4-5 mins
Could a higher dose help the crash?,"Sounds pretty good to me, great work üí™ then yeah I‚Äôd consider upping the dose to 30. It‚Äôs a rather standard dose and on the lower side of the scale, so it would not be strange at all."
Could a higher dose help the crash?,Honestly unsure of actual data related all I have is my experience. Mine lasts 4-5hrs. With Dex booster at 4hr and 7hr mark I am productive and focused from ~7-5. Even if the medication seems like it‚Äôs not doing much from early afternoon and energy levels deplete I still have a clear mind and decent focus. Reacts differently for everyone
Could a higher dose help the crash?,"Sorry if this seems obvious just checking, have you been drinking lots of water, had a high protien breakfast and good sleep? These are the 3 things that usually stop a crash. Also, have you cut out caffiene?

Definitely worth speaking to your prescriber to see if 30mg helps, if you feel it's too intense again you could always drop back to 20mg"
Could a higher dose help the crash?,When this happens to me I drink a 100mg energy drink and it really helps. Sometimes I‚Äôll even drink a 2nd one later too.
Could a higher dose help the crash?,"Yes, yes, and it‚Äôs been hit or miss. I slept for around 5 hours last night. I‚Äôve cut out caffeine. 

I tried 30mg for 6 days a few months ago but it was too intense and sent me into a panic. I still have 22 of those pills so my plan would be to start them after getting through the 20mgs."
Could a higher dose help the crash?,"Could be the lack of sleep causing the crash, is it the meds that are keeping you up or have you always struggled with sleep?

How long ago did you cut out caffiene? The first couple weeks of caffiene withdrawal can be pretty rough I had heachaches and felt really fatigued.

Do always speak to your prescriber before going up a dose, it is pretty normal for people to need to go up a dose though."
Could a higher dose help the crash?,"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the meds affecting the sleep - it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve always struggle with on and off. I haven‚Äôt had caffeine for probably over a month, and I didn‚Äôt drink coffee that regularly anyway."
Am I expecting the moon?,"I had the same expectations when I started meds months ago. I am on 50mg Vyvanse and 20mg generic adderal booster and I am in college and like you said nothing sticks when reading. The stories I would read of people finally able to concentrate,study and get straight A‚Äôs made me really hopeful and now that Iam on meds it helps with executive dysfunction to clean"
