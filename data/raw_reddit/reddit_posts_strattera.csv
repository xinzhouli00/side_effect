going from 40-60mg today,"Maybe increased side effects for a while. Or maybe nothing at all. We dont know about any current side effects you may have, how the current dose works for you, or what the therapeutical dose might be for your body, or how your body metabolizes the medication"
going from 40-60mg today,"I hope you've spent at least 3 weeks on 40mg before you decide to increase. Either way, my ADHD symptoms exacerbate when leaping up a dose. But no one can say exactly what you'll experience."
going from 40-60mg today,"I noticed resting heart rate increase, sleep disturbance and a bit of constipation from 40-60mg. Took 60mg for three weeks then went back to 40mg. I was hoping for more benefits from 60mg but didn’t notice much difference other than sides. Plan to stay on 40mg and add a use when needed stimulant for ADHD treatment. I like Strattera for what it is, it just isn’t the cure all for most of my symptoms unfortunately. Good luck!"
going from 40-60mg today,"An average adult should use this medicine at least 80 mg. If he/she weighs between 70-80 kilos. I use 40 mg and I have finished 3 weeks. I think I will never see 80 mg.Because I have panic disorder and I also take lexapro and buspirone. In order to get the full benefit of the drug, it should be used at least 80 mg for 6-8 weeks. When increasing the dose, it should be waited for at least 4 weeks.But some of the side effects of this damn drug are not as simple as it says on the leaflet. The side effects really destroy people. If you can't get to that dose, it doesn't have the full effect. I will stay on 40 mg for at least another month. I respect those who can handle high doses. But I won't take that gamble. Good luck"
going from 40-60mg today,"When I went up to 100mg (most recent because I stayed there for 2 years also the dosage cap I think), I felt a difference day 2"

Stomach issues ,I take mine at night !
Stomach issues ,"I did that for about a week before my protein shake turned on me. It seemed like it was enough to get rid of the post pill nausea but it eventually made it worse. You could always try it to see if it works for you but I would not recommend it due to my experience. Carbs seems to do the trick, maybe some cheese and crackers or bread with something in place of the shake if you can muster it."
Stomach issues ,This is why I take mine right after I eat dinner at night. I could not manage to eat enough in the mornings when I tried
Stomach issues ,Did it keep yall up at night?
Newly on strattera ,Sometimes you gotta trust your gut! There’s other options out there
Newly on strattera ,"It made me that way but I also had a very unbalanced lifestyle because of my ADHD. Strattera helped me get things organized, helped me get regulated, and that anger went away."
Newly on strattera ,I wanna try stimulants but I have to get my heart checked first:(
Newly on strattera ,"I hate the waiting game of meds to see if they're actually going to help, I already struggle with anger issues and being irritated over stupid things and I'm frustrated that the strattera is making it worse"
Newly on strattera ,Aww that’s weird🤔 because you want to get it checked? Or the doctor told you had to before going on them? I always had concerns with stims because I’ve heard the long term effects on your heart can cause complications and other problems later so that makes sense to check your 🫀first
Newly on strattera ,"I am the same way, honestly. I have a bit of a short fuse and I get really overstimulated very easily. I feel like taking that medicine showed me how big of a mess my life was...

This is vague, but since I've started Strattera:

1. I have been able to be more consistent with discipline with my kids - which has led to better behaviors, bad habits leaving.

2. My coworker who still drives me nuts, drives me significantly less nuts because I've been able to draw boundaries.

3. I had some issues in my marriage (HUGE issues) that resolved.

4. I used to drink alot of liquor and wine, and I am now almost 10 days quit, and don't feel like I need that dopamine hit anymore.

5. My relationship with food has balanced out, normalized, and I don't feel like I can't control myself around food. Another dopamine issue.

Idk if this would help, but I stayed the course and things actually got better when I finally levelled out."
Newly on strattera ,my Dr said I had to bc my oldest sister has POTS
How much did strattera help you?,"I would say it giving %30 of Concerta’s brain clarity for 24/7 instead of %100 for 4-6 hrs only. No crash which as a Mom I truly appreciate. 
60% Better anxiety and emotional regulation,  100% stopped my emotional eating, fixed diarrheic ibs"
How much did strattera help you?,my dad told me I was close to 100% mental health wise
Faster ejaculation,"kind of. it takes more arousal for me to get hard. so it happens LATER in the journey of my arousal, and closer to when i orgasm. Like a guy who shows up 1 minute before the movie starts, instead of the usual.. uh. lets say 3 minutes. :p"
Faster ejaculation,My dr prescribed me Cialis and it works really well. (31m)
Faster ejaculation,Yes.
Faster ejaculation,"I don’t get it lol. I find it has curved my sexual appetite too in general, which I don’t mind. But are you saying it doesn’t really affect how long you can hold before ejaculation?"
Faster ejaculation,"i'm saying it doesn't get ""normal hard"" until i'm 95% about to bust."
Why am i so bored now?,"When I started Adhd medication I got this because I used to spend a lot of time in my head, and the meds took me out of that space. I wasn’t spending so much time just thinking and getting distracted by my thoughts. It made me feel like I had to keep myself busy with things like reading, writing music, or going for walks. 

I think this is just a sign that your meds are working. Sitting around isn’t good for your brain. Your brain wants to be stimulated and this new boredom you’re experiencing is a good thing. I’m not on strattera yet, but I plan to take it with Dexedrine because I feel like I’m not getting enough out of stimulants alone, so my experience is just from Dexedrine, not strattera."
Why am i so bored now?,Just want to say it took 3 months for Strattera to fully kick in for me. So it may not be fully working yet.
Why am i so bored now?,"Haha it’s only been two weeks for me and yes, I’ve been feeling bored. But is that a bad thing? I always felt like I didn’t have enough time to do things, exercising, hobbies etc and now I’m feeling bored enough to actually do things. 
Maybe look into some hobbies or things you have been putting off?"
Why am i so bored now?,yeah true
Why am i so bored now?,"Opposite effect for me, I get bored but don't want to do anything. Maybe it's my depression doing that."
Why am i so bored now?,In my experience of taking the medication it helps with staying on task rather than starting a task. Task initiation and motivation are generally the stimulants
Why am i so bored now?,I’m finding that my environment is a lot tidier because I am putting pots and pans away in those “bored” moments
Why am i so bored now?,Yeah i like don’t know what to do. It’s like an itch in a way of that makes sense and I’m struggling with what i should be doing when i get like that. It’s not all the time but when it hits me it really hits me.
Why am i so bored now?,Possible. I’m on medication for that though.
Why am i so bored now?,I think my problem is i don’t know what to do.
Why am i so bored now?,Maybe i need to make a mass list of chores and when i get bored knock some off
Why am i so bored now?,I definitely wouldn’t think of this as a bad thing. I think just finding things that you find interesting and filling your time with them should help. I definitely started to do things like read when I started my ADHD meds to fill those time slots.
Why am i so bored now?,I just do whatever the adhd roulette decrees. Directing focus takes energy.
Strattera and Adderall ,"Strattera might work for ADHD. SSRIs are the gold standard for OCD meds. 
I’ve taken strattera with Ritalin and I love it. Adderrall would probably be pretty similar. Strattera helps the Ritalin work better and then the strattera works all day."
Strattera and Adderall ,"I am diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and inattentive ADHD - undiagnosed but also considering of OCD (runs in the family)… strattera was the first medication I tried and while it offered little to no help with the ADHD it offered massive improvements for everything else. My general anxiety is lowered and my rumination and “loops” I got stuck in are almost entirely gone. If they aren’t totally gone then I can at least acknowledge them and actually choose to act differently. Unfortunately my skin picking is way up - but the mental benefits are far too good so I don’t mind that trade off.

After a few months my doctor added in a small dose of Adderall and the pair work marvelously for me! Now I not only don’t get stuck in loops but I also have the energy to get done what I want to do."
Strattera and Adderall ,"I've tried many SSRIs, and the side effects are horrible."
Strattera and Adderall ,"Same here in terms of getting stuck in thought loops, sensitivites and emotional regulation. My skin picking is about the same its always been."
Strattera and Adderall ,"Thank you for sharing! Hopefully, it will work greatly for me."
Strattera and Adderall ,Oh well then be careful with strattera. The side effects can be kind of similar. NRIs and SSRIs are somewhat related.
Strattera and Adderall ,"I've lost hair, my libido was gone, migraines,  tremor, hyperflexia,  weight gain, and much more."
"Feeling emotionally exhausted/overwhelmed easily, is this normal? ",The adjustment period can be rough even on low dose. I say stick to it for at least 2 months (I'm no doctor). Then decide. There was light at the end of the tunnel for me. But everyone chemistry is so different.
"Feeling emotionally exhausted/overwhelmed easily, is this normal? ",Are you taking it for ADHD?  Because it sounds like it is exasperating your symptoms.  It helped with my function but I felt incredibly overwhelmed all the time on it.
"Feeling emotionally exhausted/overwhelmed easily, is this normal? ","I dose increased 25 (1w) > 50 (3w) > 60 (4w) and now > 80 (1w) things kinda felt like they were “getting worse” in a way like you described until this week on 80. Night and day difference when I look back. Give your body some time to adjust to the extra norepinephrine. Starting this med is essentially tricking your brain into thinking it’s having a panic attack but your brain does get used to it. If you’ve not having severe / mental health issues I’d give it some time.

Also what helps me with energy is drinking plenty of water, B vitamins, and omega 3s. You might have electrolyte imbalance from excess sweating or other side effects"
"Feeling emotionally exhausted/overwhelmed easily, is this normal? ","I have days like this - usually happens if I overexerted myself. I am also autistic, so prone to the occasional meltdown. Overall, the medicine mostly helps with these symptoms and managing my days has become easier because im more emotionally regulated."
"Feeling emotionally exhausted/overwhelmed easily, is this normal? ","Worked the exact opposite  for me. Made the depression, anxiety, and panic attacks go away"
"Feeling emotionally exhausted/overwhelmed easily, is this normal? ","Yeah my psychiatrist prescribed it to me for ADHD and Anxiety, Im hoping this is just for the adjustment period and it starts to wear off soon"
"Feeling emotionally exhausted/overwhelmed easily, is this normal? ","I appreciate your feedback and suggestions, Im so glad its been working for you! Idk whats considered severe mental health issues but I do find myself pretty depressed a lot of the time and too overwhelmed to do anything, it kinda feels like my brain wont work even though I want it to.. however Ive been like this before taking the medication its just now Im more emotional and tired it seems 🤷‍♀️"
"Feeling emotionally exhausted/overwhelmed easily, is this normal? ","since your autistic do you notice anything specific it does while your on it? Ive been on the up and down for the past year contemplating if Im on the spectrum, I have pretty bad social anxiety and was hoping it’ll help with that in some way. Im glad its been helping you though :)"
"Feeling emotionally exhausted/overwhelmed easily, is this normal? ",Thats odd. Im second guessing if I need something more for anxiety rather than ADHD but Idk if it works that way
"Feeling emotionally exhausted/overwhelmed easily, is this normal? ","It's making less sensory sensitive, which is a huge blessing. I'm less bothered by every single single thing like temperature, weather changes, lights, sounds and so on 😊 I dont really have social anxiety, so not sure if it helps with that. I think because I'm not chasing dopamine to the same extent I have been more content in my own company and not constantly having fomo. 

I can still get overstimulated and such, but my bandwidth overall is much better."
Dry mouth,"Try adding a pinch of salt in your water. Often times when you drink a lot of water, you drain your body of electrolytes which can make your mouth dry, or just feel dehydrated all together. Add a sprinkle of salt, just not enough to make it salty (however, I have added more than a pinch and it makes the water “taste” better). Try it out and see what tastes the best, but it’s probably the lack of electrolytes."
Dry mouth,"It became a little better for me, but overall no. I'm six months in. 
You can buy dry mouth moisturizing spray, gel or drops. Try your local pharmacy. Make sure to keep hydrated, and note that you may need additional dental visits.  Dry mouth can cause increased tartar build up and thereby gum disease. I had more tartar than six months ago when I went for a dental check up last week."
Dry mouth,I'd get really bad dry mouth a couple hours after taking it. It would get to the point where on the weekend days that I have martial arts practice I would feel way more dehydrated than I actually was. It persisted the entire 7 months I was on 100mgs of it. You can mitigate it by sucking on lozenges or using dry mouth rinses. During the work day I would sometimes swish water in my mouth and hold it there for a few seconds. My water bottle became my best friend lol.
Dry mouth,This is actually one side effect that is leading me to discontinue atomoxitine .
Dry mouth,Thank you for the advice!
Dry mouth,Wow I guess some symptoms just never go away
Dry mouth,Wow that sucks. I don’t have health insurance so trips to the dentist probably won’t happen. I’ll definitely look into dry mouth drops because right now my tongue almost feels like a cat’s tongue.
Dry mouth,"Thanks for the advice! Yeah I feel so dehydrated a few hours after taking it, too."
Heart rate increased WAY more on Strattera than adderall??,"Same, its higher than on concerta and vyvanse"
"High Blood Pressure on Strattera—Seeking Advice and Insights: didn’t have any issues at first, but now a few months into round two with Strattera, I’ve got very high BP.","Get on a blood pressure lowering medication if its high enough that it's needed. Otherwise make a switch to wellbutrin which may have similar mechanisms to strattera for norepinephrine. If wellbutrin is not enough, then introduce a stimulant dose for combination therapy. Wellbutrin has blood pressure lowering effects, so you will not encounter the same problem.

You can try cutting out all processed food and all meats, eggs and dairy for a while. Whole food plant based is a diet used to treat heart diseases and plaque in the arteries. You can check out the documentary What the Health. 

However, if the blood pressure issue is purely medication related, you might not see a reduction. However, you will likely see an inprovement in inflammation in your body."
"High Blood Pressure on Strattera—Seeking Advice and Insights: didn’t have any issues at first, but now a few months into round two with Strattera, I’ve got very high BP.",Just for reference; Strattera is NON-stimulant medication.  The likelihood you have higher BP due to Straterra versus an actual stimulant is very low.
"High Blood Pressure on Strattera—Seeking Advice and Insights: didn’t have any issues at first, but now a few months into round two with Strattera, I’ve got very high BP.","Both my Strattera and my Concerta slightly increased my heart rate and bp.

Me and my doc aren't worried because the risk of being unmedicated greatly outweighs the increased risk of heart issues.

There's some research papers about it specifically for stimulants but I'd assume that the same applies to Strattera. (I'd add links but I'm too tired to go digging through my old comments)


Ahhh, just read that it wasn't doing that originally.
Then I have no idea what could be happening."
"High Blood Pressure on Strattera—Seeking Advice and Insights: didn’t have any issues at first, but now a few months into round two with Strattera, I’ve got very high BP.",Yes dude. I usually have low BP (105/70) but after strattera I keep getting 140+/90 BP. And a heart rate above 100. Feels horrible
"High Blood Pressure on Strattera—Seeking Advice and Insights: didn’t have any issues at first, but now a few months into round two with Strattera, I’ve got very high BP.",Some people including me have gotten a beta blocker from the doctor and it helps
"High Blood Pressure on Strattera—Seeking Advice and Insights: didn’t have any issues at first, but now a few months into round two with Strattera, I’ve got very high BP.",Wellbutrin actually raises some people's BP and RHR.
"High Blood Pressure on Strattera—Seeking Advice and Insights: didn’t have any issues at first, but now a few months into round two with Strattera, I’ve got very high BP.","Well. I’ve been on stimulants for more than 15 years without BP issues. But now after less than two years on Strattera I have BP issues. 

I’ve also done a recent stim holiday for about a week, no change in BP."
"High Blood Pressure on Strattera—Seeking Advice and Insights: didn’t have any issues at first, but now a few months into round two with Strattera, I’ve got very high BP.",Didnt know that - thanks.
"Yes, skipping a day does make it work effectively, but also makes me buzzy and kind of puzzled","And there is piece of mind too. Also, I feel urge to m*sturbate quite often"
"Yes, skipping a day does make it work effectively, but also makes me buzzy and kind of puzzled","Tea enhances effectiveness of strattera, as I observed"
"Yes, skipping a day does make it work effectively, but also makes me buzzy and kind of puzzled",I experienced the same when skipping a dose.

What symptoms did strattera help you with the most,"So far I have noticed that I can problem solve to the end of a problem, not give up halfway through thinking about a solution. I have a lot less anxiety. I am able to remember things MUCH better. I am still at 25 mg but I can notice a real difference. I am thirsty all the time and slightly constipated,  but I have lived for 57 years like this. I'm absolutely  not living the rest of my life like I lived the first 57. I am looking at the rest of my life with optimism.  Please dont wait until 57 to get a diagnosis."
What symptoms did strattera help you with the most,"The constant song in my head goes away, also my diarrhea of the mouth. My food sniffing compulsion also goes away, though that one is just makes me look weird, not.annoying"
What symptoms did strattera help you with the most,for me it was everything other than direct focus but it’s been 2 years and it absolutely changed everything about my life for the better
What symptoms did strattera help you with the most,"- Can get up easier
- Can focus a little better, not the same as stimulants
- Can get things done easier

I’m at 25mg and plan to titrate up slowly (monthly)"
What symptoms did strattera help you with the most,Having normal digestion man that was annoying! /s
What symptoms did strattera help you with the most,80mg here. It has gotten rid of my anxiety completely. That in itself has been life changing. Still struggling with motivation though.
What symptoms did strattera help you with the most,"Absent-mindedness, emotional dysregulation, binge eating."
What symptoms did strattera help you with the most,"impulsivity, mood swings, anxiety and depression. "
What symptoms did strattera help you with the most,"The biggest thing for me was my emotional dysregulation. I have more patience and am just calmer. I also am able to organize things better. I just go about doing things that should be done and I don't have to think about it. everything is just MUCH easier. I'm so happy I started it. And it's only been two weeks, I hope it continues!"
What symptoms did strattera help you with the most,"Anxiety, big time. Maybe even too much because I sometimes do not care at all about things that used to bother me and consume my thoughts. I have had zero panic attacks since starting atomoxitine and I am grateful for that."
What symptoms did strattera help you with the most,"Did you by any chance notice a difference in how you felt about music? Just wondering because I felt like I had less of an emotional reaction to music (and therefore didn't enjoy it in the same way), and I haven't heard of anyone else having that side effect, but you mentioned something music related."
What symptoms did strattera help you with the most,"I did the same thing- starting at 25 and slowly increasing. Thought I might as well share my experience. 

Over the previous Jan-October I went from 25 to 50 to 75 as my body adapted. Found it was perfect for a bit at 50 and then was overcome with anxiety and depression- not too severe but negatively impacting my day to day. I upped it to 75 and the depression was so much worse. Got off and I think the issue was 50 was already too much but didn’t impact me until it has built up in my system after around 2-3 months. I wish I had gone down to 40 rather jumping up to 75 but I didn’t realize what was going on. I thought it wasn’t working because I had adapted too quick to the dose. I got off on halloween and woke up the next day no longer feeling depressed. Have been so happy and motivated since. Strange since the first 6 months I was on Strattera, it most definitely improved my mental health and worked as an anti depressant. I struggle with fatigue and it was no longer there. I could get so much done in my day to day and generally felt so much happier 24/7. It made getting through my shifts easy and my work ethic was incredible. It also helped with hunger cues and no longer was binging at night. I used to smoke weed 24/7 for a few years and then only at night by the end but Strattera immediately caused me to lose interest in it as I didn’t crave the relief anymore. While it made me happy and focused, it isolated my anxiety so that was there but manageable until about month 7. By August my sleep was just fever dreams and I was waking up more tired and stressed than before going to bed. Aside from that the nausea was impossible to deal with by the end. 

25mg Jan 1-May 

50mg May-August

75mg August-October 30"
What symptoms did strattera help you with the most,"Unfortunately yes, that is exactly how it was. After a bit of time some of that did come back to an extent, but never to previous levels. I actually thought I missed the head song part, I even mentioned it to some co workers. Then I was suddenly taken off and  put on wellbutrin. When all my previous symptoms came rushing back, and my life I'd worked hard on building up started unraveling....I decided I don't miss the head songs in the long run. I only miss the happy/hyper mood I sometimes got from it, not the sleepless nights that came with it."
What symptoms did strattera help you with the most,"I still get emotions and sometimes goosebumps from music, I find songs to be the only thing that still gets me, and I am thankful for that. Art, music, is meant to be touching and I find nothing wrong with it."
What symptoms did strattera help you with the most,So generally you’re not going back on Stattera as you’re better off without it? or you’re going to go back on it but on a lower dose?
What symptoms did strattera help you with the most,"Interesting, thanks!"
What symptoms did strattera help you with the most,Right now I’m trying to see how I feel with it out of my system and naturally get myself into a routine. Routine is great for me but hard to maintain so I like to get myself there and then take the medication to help me maintain it. I would be open to trying it one more time at 40mg. I did love Strattera while it was working it was the happiest I think I’ve ever been for the first couple months
What symptoms did strattera help you with the most,"I’m finding that lower doses are working for me, it helps me to keep my routine going. 18mg and 25mg for me."
TMI Constipation / Working Out ,"Miralax + Metamucil daily is what a few here have recommended. I’ve done Miralax daily-ish for about a month, it’s the only thing that works."
TMI Constipation / Working Out ,"For me, I had to give up my daily morning poop. I eat lots of vegetables, drink lots of water. I now go every 2-3 days.

Sometimes on the weekend, I go four times🤷🏻‍♂️

No advice on pre workout."
Had to come off straterra ,"it’s always good to listen to your doctor.

for me personally, it took a month for me to FEEL normal heart rate wise. and two months for my readings to be objectively close to normal. my HR is still 5bpm above what it was, but blood pressure (and stamina) is back to normal."
Had to come off straterra ,"Depending on your dose it the halflife is around 5 hours.

However, the norepinephrine (which is responsible for your HR) will probably stay quite a bit longer, and even longer the more you worry about it. HR of 100 is well within what's anecdotally been bandied about and is an expected natural reaction to having more norepinephrine before your body learns what to do with it."
Had to come off straterra ,"I slowly tapered off from 100mg to 80 for a week, then 40 for a couple weeks and thankfully didn't suffer from any adverse side effects in the process. I think it was mostly cause I was transitioning to Adderall and was on 10mg during that entire process."
Had to come off straterra ,I would keep taking it but whenever I tried to sleep my heart felt like it was gonna pound out of my chest
Had to come off straterra ,It elevated my blood pressure to the point I almost went to the ER last night.made me feel like I'm in a constant panic. I wish I could stay on the med I really do. My mental health has been great for a week but my bp being like 150/80 scared me.
Had to come off straterra ,"I was having a similar issue BUT counterintuitively I realized it was actually caused by reflux/indigestion (also caused by strattera). When I treated the reflux with Mylanta and elevating my head, my heart rate went down when sleeping"
Had to come off straterra ,What dose are you on? Can you ask your Dr to lower it and titrate gradually? 
Had to come off straterra ,"Yes, it's the bodys response to having more adrenaline in your system then it's used to and it will last from a few days to a few weeks while you're titrating up to therapeutic dose.

Only you and your doc can decide if it's worth it."
Had to come off straterra ,I wish this was me. I'm still having anxiety attacks after a day from taking straterra
Had to come off straterra ,I'm on 40mg. I'm on day 2 without meds and the anxiety is subsiding finally. Blood pressure is still a bit high 140/90
Had to come off straterra ,"40mg is the typical prescribed starting dose but in my experience (and by the suggestion of my Dr), it's way too high, even for adults. I had terrible blood pressure the first two times I tried Atomoxetine at 40mg and had to stop. Now, having started at less than the lowest dose and going up slowly, my body's adjusting well and my bp is within a normal range. Might be worth a shot if you wanted to give it another try."
Had to come off straterra ,I might give it another try but gotta wait for my appointment on the 3th
I’m actually cleaning up!!,"Same! Organized my pantry today. Got a gym membership few days ago and scheduled two necessary appointments, and I've been following a to-do list for the first time in my life!"
I’m actually cleaning up!!,"I'm seeing benefits, but i have days where i get so depressed that i don't want to do anything. I need to get back on antidepressants and it sucks cause i was doing so well without them. I thought i didn't need them anymore and it didn't occur to me that i could have a comorbidity."
I’m actually cleaning up!!,"I was just bragging to my husband how I made a to-do list for the morning and actually completed it. I showered n washed my hair, hung up a basket of clothes, gathered dirty clothes into a bin, and changed the cats’ litter boxes. All without grousing at myself or trying to reign in my scattered thoughts. Just did it!"
I’m actually cleaning up!!,Yes I have a before and after picture of my room when I first started Strattera! I knew it was working because I started cleaning up after myself more! When I was only taking Ritalin cleaning was still difficult
I’m actually cleaning up!!,How long u taking and what dose?
I’m actually cleaning up!!,ME TOO. My bathroom counter is clean. It's a fucking anomaly.
I’m actually cleaning up!!,"That’s amazing to hear! 

I’m finally not just throwing my clothes around , I’m actually putting them away if I’m not wearing them. Small wins ans I’ll take it"
I’m actually cleaning up!!,It’s ok to have both
I’m actually cleaning up!!,"It’s nice right?! Today i put away two baskets of clean clothes, put the dryer stuff away , did dishes and cleaned up some stuff just around the house, took a shower and ready to for the day now."
I’m actually cleaning up!!,A month at 40 a week at 60
I’m actually cleaning up!!,Yay!
I’m actually cleaning up!!,Normies really be living like this huh? Just knowing what needs to be done and then doing them haha. It's such a seemingly small gift but damn it makes a huge difference. 
I’m actually cleaning up!!,It really does
"Just started, what’s going to happen?","Are you drinking caffeine during the day by chance? I notice this is worse for me on days I drink caffeine, I try to stay clear of it, or at least drink things where the MG of caffeine is clearly labeled and is as low as possible. these days, I can hardly handle the small red bulls with 80 mg of caffeine"
"Just started, what’s going to happen?","The palpations will stop being noticeable after your body and brain gets used to more noradrenalin circulating. The first few days were pretty intense for me too. I felt like I had drunk 3 cups of very strong coffee. The same feeling returned with each dose increase but quickly diminished.

My heart rate is consistently higher than when unmedicated. And when I'm moving about my day, its usually in the same range as you describe, and I dont even feel it anymore. It looks pretty wild to watch it be that high, but not dangerous. You'll get used to it soon enough.  Increased blood pressure is what you got to watch out for. 

Just wait when you watch the pill kick in. My heart rate briefly rises up to 150 sometimes, then falls back down to about 80-90 for the rest of the day. 😄 

I checked all this with my psych, by the way, and she was the one who told me it is common on the medication.

If you have trouble sleeping, then consider taking the pill in the morning. Some people get tired from it, others get a boost of energy, so you have to find the right time of the day for your body. I personally take in the morning, and I sleeping better than I ever have. Had sleep problems during the first week though."
"Just started, what’s going to happen?",Same here
"Just started, what’s going to happen?",I don’t have any caffeine bc I’ve always had a bad reaction to it
Terrible diarrhea for 7 days straight after starting Strattera ,"Straterras caused some stuff in the stomach, I had to take pantaloc. It's not something that will get better I would say. So you should already look for something else.

Otherwise try to eat something unhealthy with fat. That was helping me a lot when it made my stomach struggle. As stupid as it sounds."
Terrible diarrhea for 7 days straight after starting Strattera ,"I am starting it as well, on day 21 up to 60mg. For me I had some nausea which I started taking it with food in the morning, specifically oatmeal, or porridge, with nut butter and fruit. The protein and fiber seems to not have the medication absorb all at once and has helped with all of my stomach issues. I will say they are nowhere as extreme as what you are experiencing. I hope you find some relief."
Terrible diarrhea for 7 days straight after starting Strattera ,"It will pass, hang in there 😰"
Terrible diarrhea for 7 days straight after starting Strattera ,"Oof, definitely let your doctor know, you don’t want to risk dehydration. Seven days is a lot, I know you’re hurting 😩"
Terrible diarrhea for 7 days straight after starting Strattera ,byproduct of serotonin regulating. it has an effect on the digestive tract. Withdrawal has the opposite effect
Terrible diarrhea for 7 days straight after starting Strattera ,What do you mean eat something unhealthy?  I tried to eat a chicken quesadilla the other day and it was a massive mistake.
Terrible diarrhea for 7 days straight after starting Strattera ,That’s the interesting thing…I haven’t had any nausea at all.  I’ve had a little bit of the random chills and I’ve been sleepy (but sleeping great).  Those are the only other side effects I’ve experienced.  I’ve always taken it with food.  I was fine the first two days then day three the diarrhea hit and hasn’t gone away since.  I haven’t read about anyone else having this type of reaction.  Thanks for sharing your experience.
Terrible diarrhea for 7 days straight after starting Strattera ,How long do you think?
Terrible diarrhea for 7 days straight after starting Strattera ,TY!  Definitely hurting
Terrible diarrhea for 7 days straight after starting Strattera ,"Something with a lot of fat. Usually for me pizzas, chips, bread, cake.

The opposite of milk I would say.

This thing was giving me acid reflux a lot. So by doing that It helped a lot."
Terrible diarrhea for 7 days straight after starting Strattera ,"High protein and fat is important because this is a protein-binding molecule which has also been shown to have its metabolic timeframe drawn out by taking with a high-fat meal. 

If you're experiencing severe side effects, a very fatty meal with a source high in protein (whether that's part of the meal or just a protein shake afterwards) will help dramatically smooth out the metabolic curve and keep it from hitting your guts all at once. For most of us this just helps with the nausea, but it seems like your body is *a bit more sensitive* to this medication than most. 

The high protein will also help more of it transport through your bloodstream which in turn makes the intended effects stronger."
Terrible diarrhea for 7 days straight after starting Strattera ,"I believe more than a month. I’m 1,5 months in and just recently the nausea feeling stopped."
Terrible diarrhea for 7 days straight after starting Strattera ,"are you eating enough fiber? I know it’s commonly associated with constipation but it can help here, too!"
Terrible diarrhea for 7 days straight after starting Strattera ,Okay thanks very much for the info I appreciate it.  I just find it so strange that I’m the only one with constant diarrhea and everyone else is constipated and nauseous.  Makes me wonder if this is just not the right med for me for whatever reason
Terrible diarrhea for 7 days straight after starting Strattera ,My diet is really pretty good!  I can try increasing fiber.
Terrible diarrhea for 7 days straight after starting Strattera ,"Ugh that’s almost worse to hear! It would make more sense if you were barely eating or were taking in mostly fruits or fast food or something. Last ditch effort at least to let your body rest, try Imodium, take it easy this weekend, call your doctor on Monday? It could be a sign your body just doesn’t like the med."
Terrible diarrhea for 7 days straight after starting Strattera ,"Thank you!  I agree, it may just not be for me.  I see a lot of people saying to stick it out for 2 weeks to a month but this seems more severe of a reaction than most are having.  Anyway, thanks for reaching out"
I quit 2 weeks ago/ tinnitus,You need to talk to your doctor that prescribed it to you. Those symptoms doesn’t sound too good.
I quit 2 weeks ago/ tinnitus,"I did tell her about all the symptoms 3weeks ago (except for the tinnitus) and she told me to cut back the dose in half for a week to then quit. All the other symptoms have stopped but this ear thing hasn’t. I just realized it last night that it isn’t just me laying down in a weird way, it’s pretty consistent whenever I’m on my sides. I’m genuinely wondering if anybody else dealt with it and had to look for specific treatment or if it just went away after a while."
I quit 2 weeks ago/ tinnitus,"I’ll bring it up just in case, too. Thanks for the suggestion!"
I quit 2 weeks ago/ tinnitus,I’m glad you’re off it. Medicines can be weird on some peoples body.
I quit 2 weeks ago/ tinnitus,Not a problem! Good luck!
Strattera for 7 year old.,"I took strattera when I was 10, my mom says she took me off of it because ""i didn't like how it felt"" but I don't remember that. I do remember I had the best grades of my life though. 
Im back to trying it at 31."
Dysautonomia?,"It's not likely to do anything for POTS and might make it worse. I personally take it for ADHD and have not noticed worsening of my POTS while on it (except for the initial two weeks or so, but the side effects went away) but here's a study about how it often can make it worse: 

[Effects of norepinephrine reuptake inhibition on postural tachycardia syndrome](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24002370/)

> Conclusion: Norepinephrine reuptake inhibition with atomoxetine acutely increased standing HR and symptom burden in patients with POTS.

other forms of dysautonomia could theoretically benefit from it. here's a paper on the use of low dose atomoxetine in patients with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (which i guess makes sense because it's known to increase blood pressure):

[Efficacy of atomoxetine versus midodrine for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.50968)

however, here's another paper discussing how this property can mean that it can also cause hypertension (high blood pressure) in those with impaired autonomic function:

[Norepinephrine Transporter Blockade With Atomoxetine Induces Hypertension in Patients With Impaired Autonomic Function](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/hypertensionaha.107.089961)

> Atomoxetine, a selective norepinephrine transporter blocker, could increase blood pressure by elevating norepinephrine concentration in peripheral sympathetic neurons. This effect may be masked in healthy subjects by central sympatholytic mechanisms. To test this hypothesis we studied the pressor effect of 18 mg of atomoxetine (pediatric dose) in 21 patients with damage of the central (10 subjects) and peripheral (11 subjects) autonomic nervous system.

it's complicated. ask your doctor."
Dysautonomia?,"It has a tendency to make POTS worse, but all you can do is try"
High heart rate,"Yes mine is 10bpm higher resting, 20-30bpm higher when exercising."
High heart rate,"The last two times I tried it, it gave me scary high heart rates, but that was likely due to starting at too high of a dose. This third time I started at 5mg (10mg split roughly in half) and the increased heart rate only lasted for a few weeks. I’m now up to 25mg and feeling okay."
High heart rate,Mine went up for several weeks and began to go back to normal.
High heart rate,"Is there any deaths related to this side effect of Strattera or is it recommended to people who have heart disease or who have high blood pressure? It’s crazy how a non-stimulant raises your heart rate, yet stimulant raises it even most which is even more scary for young children and adults."
High heart rate,"Yes, it is a common side effect and one of the reasons why I am sometimes take breaks from Strattera. If I do sport, I take beta blocker to lower heart rate."
High heart rate,Yes. My watch noticed a higher resting heart rate. Doctor prescribed a beta blocker and it helps
High heart rate,I take propranolol xr to combat it
High heart rate,I noticed my heart rate goes high but I guess taking this pill for months reallly reduced my appetite so it exacerbated my anemia which I thought was driving my heart rate up. I suppose it's worth asking my doc next visit.
High heart rate,"Usually the increase in heart rate is fairly minor and shouldn't pose any risk to a healthy adult, especially a younger one. But yeah it warrants more caution in those who are at risk of or already have a heart condition or some other cardiovascular condition."
High heart rate,Did your doctor recommend to you to take a beta blocker before activity?
Decreasing for sexual side effects ,"The 50mg Zoloft might be the problem. 
I’m on 200mg Zoloft and it kills my libido. 
What dose of Prozac were you on?"
Decreasing for sexual side effects ,"Yes. At 60 I had no drive and my nuts constantly felt like they were in a vise. Dropped to 40 and both issues corrected, with the exception that if I overexert myself I don't just get tired; both issues temporarily return. I can usually sleep it off, though. 

The vise feeling was almost like blue balls if blue balls also made it feel like someone was tensioning a line between your lower back and your prostate. Not a pleasant way to walk around all day for months."
Decreasing for sexual side effects ,Weirdly for me (40m on 100mg) my libido was fine but I ended up with transient ED that would last from an hour after taking my dose to the early hours of the next day. Combined with other really annoying side effects my doc and I decided I should change to something else a couple weeks ago.
Decreasing for sexual side effects ,"
I feel like it killed mine too… Mine but me Wellbutrin XR, but I’m scared to take it lol sorry you’re struggling!"
Decreasing for sexual side effects ,Anxiety reduction has increased mine or at least not diminished  it. Mid 40s
Decreasing for sexual side effects ,Doc prescribed me Cialis. Works like a charm
Decreasing for sexual side effects ,"I was on 40 of Prozac and my psych took me off and put me
On Zoloft to see if libido would come back :("
Decreasing for sexual side effects ,I wish Wellbutrin would have worked for me. I heard great things !
Decreasing for sexual side effects ,This happened to me the first 3 months - then disappeared
Decreasing for sexual side effects ,I’m a girllllllllllllll
Decreasing for sexual side effects ,How long have you been on Zoloft?
Decreasing for sexual side effects ,Has Strattera been working good for you? Wellbutrin didn’t work for me either and I start Strattera next week
Decreasing for sexual side effects ,"Same here, I was very sad to not get the ultra productive honeymoon phase or the increased libido"
Decreasing for sexual side effects ,"Welll shiiiiit, I don’t recommend it then"
Decreasing for sexual side effects ,Like 2 weeks now
Decreasing for sexual side effects ,"Over the last year, the biggest thing it helps me with is emotional regulation and also I don’t get so stressed and overwhelmed anymore. I’m able to just handle things pretty easily. I don’t think it helps with focus really. And it does nothing for my executive dysfunction. and I’ve been all over the place with dosages. Went up to 80 at one point and I felt like I had no thoughts anymore lol everyone is different tho!"
Decreasing for sexual side effects ,😂😂😂
Decreasing for sexual side effects ,"Very often if you keep taking the medication, the sexual dysfunction goes away after a few weeks. Like a month. Like my libido isn’t completely dead, just greatly diminished because I’m on a high dose."
Decreasing for sexual side effects ,Hopefully it improves now that I’m off the Prozac. We shall see.
Fatigue...,fwiw i started about a week ago and my doc told me to start with taking it at night from the start. so far I haven't had any issues with it.
Fatigue...,It got better for me over a couple of months and also taking my daily lexapro dose in the evenings instead of with the Strattera helped immensely.
Fatigue...,My fatigue 2-3 hrs after taking it faded around day 10 or so.
Fatigue...,"I truly believe that 40mg shouldn’t be a starting dose, even for adults. Ive had more success at adjusting to the side effects at a much lower dose (like, 5mg haha) and titrating very slowly. The side effects were way more tolerable and subsided much faster. ETA: oops, to answer your question haha yes the fatigue eventually went away, too. It returns with each dose increase but doesn’t last that long, maybe a few days or a week.

Btw you mentioned Wellbutrin in another comment. I take generic Wellbutrin which may potentially increase blood levels of Strattera. All the more reason to start at a lower dose!"
Fatigue...,I take my Strattera 100mg before I go to bed and I sleep very well and have sufficient energy in the afternoon to function. I started on 40mg and found it made me drowsy so I switched to night times and have no other side effects other than mild nausea as I adjusted to the higher doses. I take it with small amount of food as well
Fatigue...,"I did start to take it at night because my doctor advised the same, but I found I had really bad acid reflux-like symptoms from it which would disrupt my sleep because I'd be jolted awake by it. I only took it for about 3 or so nights before switching to mornings when she advised I switched after a week, so maybe I still need some time."
Fatigue...,"I'm really hoping it'll subside after a while but I don't know if I can wait a few months! It's completely stunting my productivity and mood overall. I'm on Strattera and Buspar but I take the Buspar 3 times a day, I was told to stop taking my Welbutrin but I'm seeing a lot of people here taking Strattera with other medications and I'm wondering if that would benefit me at all."
Fatigue...,"Thank you, I'm gonna do my best to stick it out."
Fatigue...,I get acid reflex with the Strattera sometimes. Maybe try taking it with your evening meal? And then a few hours later swig some antacid like Gaviscon before bed.
Strattera Reviews Welcome ,"Life changer for me…I’ve never been on any type of psych meds but I suffer from some crippling anxiety and panic attacks at times. Definitely some OCD tendencies as well.  Flying in an airplane would definitely send me into a panic attack with the slightest bit of turbulence, I just took a flight a couple weeks ago and had no panic, no anxiety about the flight itself, no intrusive thoughts. 

I also have ADHD and I am taking it because I want to go back to school to get my masters degree…it took me almost 20 yrs to get my bachelors and I just don’t have that time to pussy foot around. I am able to get up early in the morning and be productive and just do stuff…and not think about it…just do it. 

I think on this sub you’ll see a lot of negative reviews, if things are good there is no reason to complain! I am also on Contrave which has Wellbutrin and naltrexone for weight loss which could also be attributing to my results. Either way, I’m very satisfied."
Strattera Reviews Welcome ,I'm pushing hard to stay on strattera but my physical anxiety is still present after 7 weeks (1 week at 60mg). I may add an antidepressant if it doesn't improve.
Strattera Reviews Welcome ,"While it only reduced my symptoms by half, the symptoms it did cover it did a decent job at covering it. Unmedicated I would miss work and school for no reason, spend money like it was nothing and strattera helped to stop that"
Strattera Reviews Welcome ,Did you start on 60mg right away?
Strattera Reviews Welcome ,I started at 40mg 6 weeks and after 60mg but I think I need an antidepressant. My condition is deteriorating with SAD and Strattera doesn't seem to calm my physical anxiety 😥
Is Strattera approved for OCD?,No
Is Strattera approved for OCD?,No
Is Strattera approved for OCD?,"idk but imo it definitely should be, they should literally do a case study on me because strattera has almost CURED my ocd. my ocd was unbelievably severe, insanely insanely severe and now it’s so sub clinical that i remember i have it like once a week"
Is Strattera approved for OCD?,Did you also have anxiety? Has it helped for that? Have you tried stimulants? I feel like my anxiety and ocd get way worse when the stimulants wear off in the evening.
Is Strattera approved for OCD?,"i did have severe anxiety but it was heavily attached to the ocd so i lump them together under the ocd label, if i was anxious id obsess over it and go into a state of paralysis. but then again strattera has been SO good at helping that i honestly forget what my anxiety even felt like. but yes i agree i also take vyvanse every few days to help with school and when it wears off i feel a bit of the “old me” for a few hours, but even then its not bad enough where i need to do anything about it id say"
"Accidentally missed a dose, the next dose was noticeably more effective","Yes, the effect feels stronger if I skip a day. I would say i ""chased"" the effect in the beginning mostly because the dose was actually not high enough for me.
Now I'm at a dose that works for me, and taking a dose the day after I forgot to take it actually feels too strong and unpleasant, so I try to steer clear from that. 😅"
"Accidentally missed a dose, the next dose was noticeably more effective",I am at 80 right now.  My silly adhd brain thought o you didn't take meds and I did so kinda doubled it hmm it was interesting
"Accidentally missed a dose, the next dose was noticeably more effective",My Strattera stops working for about a week if I miss a dose. It's a nightmare.
"Accidentally missed a dose, the next dose was noticeably more effective","Lol yeah that makes a lot of sense, I am titrating up to 80mg soon. Thanks!"
crohns and strattera,"Fellow Crohnie o/ yes, at first the constipation was novel and almost kinda nice change after 40 years of the runs. But it does become problematic, beware of bowel obstructions! Lots of extra water and fiber of course. Then when I need a little help I'll eat some prunes. Usually does the trick. You could also consider the colace if needed."
New patient looking for experiences or advice,"I’m 280lbs and I get results on 40mg (been all the way up to 100.

(1) Buckle up and get ready for a Corpus spongiosum that’s more limp than a wet noodle.

(2) Be careful on the aim when releasing at the porcelain disposal god also… fluid that’s meant to fire forward, can easily break the rules of science and gravity where it instead fires upwards and outwards at 90 degrees all at the same time and faster than a fire trucks hose…it’s terrible.

I would ageee 60 seems a lot to start at, i came up from 25. Don’t over think it though but maybe consider starting on a Saturday so you’re at home as side effects kick in way faster than benefits (in my experience). 

All this said, It is a great medicine and better than stims in my opinion (I have way to addictive personality so take that comment with a grain of salt).

Wish you the best, just make sure it doesn’t “blunt you”’or “put a lid” to heavily on your creative side and personality. I found higher doses did that also and I lost the real me. 

Welcome to the Club!"
New patient looking for experiences or advice,"That's way too much 60mg as a starting dose in my opinion. 

I started at 40mg for 6 weeks and when I went up to 60mg, it hit me hard

Intense fatigue, depression, anxiety.

I came close to stopping, but finally decided to continue because I see the drug's potential."
New patient looking for experiences or advice,Hi I can’t answer your question but I also just got prescribed strattera 18 mg tho. Looking forward to your experience with it!
New patient looking for experiences or advice,"Beware, the side effects when you start are brutal for many.  I've been on every SSRI and SNRI and straterra hit harder than any by a long shot.  The positive can takes weeks to months to come.  Don't expect to pop it before work and cruise through the day with high concentration.  But it can be a long term life changer if effective."
New patient looking for experiences or advice,"Hmmm i also thought the same thing. He told me in bigger people (im a male, 6’2, 220lbs) they don’t feel the effects as much with 40 mg so he started me out at 60mg and to call him back in a month to update on how it is going. Thank you for your input, do you have any advice for if I start to feel like that?? 

I am also about to be on thanksgiving break so it will give me some free time to adjust to it"
New patient looking for experiences or advice,I don't know... I was started at 80mg. Sometimes it's better to just rip the band-aid off than to suffer through each dosage increase.
New patient looking for experiences or advice,"Thank you!! You too! I was excited to hear there were non stimulants to try! I was sceptical about using a stimulant bc it seems a little more extreme, and I didn’t want to feel dependent on it (idk how “addictive” it could be, but the doc said they usually weren’t)! I’ll try to update this thread with my experience, but feel free to dm if you’d like to hear about it just in case I forget!"
New patient looking for experiences or advice,"Ideally, you should start at 40mg. Maybe you'd be able to tolerate 60mg because every body is different, but maybe that's not a good idea before working, especially with the job you have. 

It's your call."
What would Straterra do for someone with anxiety and OCD?,"Lower the mental fight or flight barriers that stop you from doing things or prevent you from moving forward. It feels like a reasonable person is beside you saying ""you know, you could actually do that thing without all the mental anguish"" 

You don't get motivated like a cup of coffee, it just lowers the barriers to actually making progress in life."
What would Straterra do for someone with anxiety and OCD?,Strattera essentially is an anti depressant
What would Straterra do for someone with anxiety and OCD?,I got put on it to help with my ADHD and to not have to add another med for my OCD. So far all it’s done is remove my anxiety. ADHD and OCD are still raging 🙃
What would Straterra do for someone with anxiety and OCD?,"Im pretty sure I have some form of undiagnosed OCD, or at least have a tendency to compulsive thoughts and actions. 

I used to have these thought loops that could get triggered by something and then would just go on for many hours, og get interrupted by for example a work day, and then continue immediately as I would leave the work. Over the years its led me to think I might have some for of thought OCD. With strattera, I have much better emotional regulation. I dont really notice having these thought loops anymore, or if I get into one, I am actually able to redirect my thoughts and move on now. Pretty amazing, actually. 

Then I have things that trigger the ""ick"" which makes want to clean, clean, clean. Unfortunately, this hasn't give away. My roomie's cleanliness in not up to my (probably OCD like) standards, so I find myself cleaning certain things several times a week and finding myself unable not to do it, if I feel triggered enough. I'm very much aware that this is a me-problem. I may be able to tolerate certain things a tiny bit better, but note sure. 🥲"
What would Straterra do for someone with anxiety and OCD?,My doctor prescribed it for me as I have ADHD and depression. It does help me to get out of bed and I have more energy but as I’m in burnout nothing can cure that
What would Straterra do for someone with anxiety and OCD?,I definitely decrease’s overthinking one thing you have to do with mental health is you have constantly reshape your inner monologue. You inner monologue caused by parenting or childhood environment is root cause of most mental health disorders. You need to take medication to slow down those overwhelming thoughts and constantly reshape your inner monologue it takes years of practice to undo what your personality has become as a child since its easier to form those connections in early years. You go back to default mode which you have to constantly actively fight from conscious mind. Because be now its like iceberg the part thats shows up is your conscious self but part thats hidden your unconscious mind is running all these monologue in background so you have to actively beware of those and reshape that. To one that is positive and not anxious you have to constantly try by meditating and reshaping those thought pattern. Just watch andrew huberman podcast with paul conti two episodes on mental health youll get many insights about mental health. Its the unconscious part that has been your personality thats causing issues here it runs in default in background so you have to be aware of it and break those patterns.
What would Straterra do for someone with anxiety and OCD?,"It actually has helped me. 

Also, The supplement NAC, when taken 2,000mg or more daily also helps with OCD. I just couldn’t handle the giant horse pills twice a day.

https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4423164/"
What would Straterra do for someone with anxiety and OCD?,It helps me with both 🤷🏼‍♀️ I’m also on Prozac.
What would Straterra do for someone with anxiety and OCD?,How many mg do you use?
What would Straterra do for someone with anxiety and OCD?,It definitely lessened my anxiety which traditional ssri’s have failed to tackle but ocd based anxiety still persists but its not as bad before i started strattera
What would Straterra do for someone with anxiety and OCD?,How many mg do you use?
What would Straterra do for someone with anxiety and OCD?,"80 mg, which is the appropriate dose for my body."
Taking with Lexapro,"Very similar. I’m taking 200mg of Zoloft for anxiety and depression and 80mg of Strattera for ADHD! I also take a bunch of other meds. It’s fine to take strattera with ssris. In some people SSRIs can change the metabolism of strattera so they need a lower Strattera dose. 
I’m also on 2mg of clonidine twice a day for ADHD and 150mg of lamictal for bipolar.

I have autism too :D"
Taking with Lexapro,"Im on 10mg lexapro and 58mg strattera, almost finishing my first month on it. 

I think the lexapro is helping with the depression symptoms and i feel focused for like 3 or 4 hours after taking the strattera and then it slowly diminishes and in the afternoon i feel tired and sleepy."
Taking with Lexapro,I’ve been on Lexapro 10mg for a couple of years and Strattera 40mg for a couple of months. I had to start taking them 12 hours apart because together they make me sleepy. Now I have more energy and focus than on just lexapro alone.
Taking with Lexapro,"I started at the same dosages. I had no issues. In fact, my anxiety is basically gone. So yay me! 

I’m now on 40mg Strattera and 5mg Lexapro, and things have been just fine."
Beneficial weight loss?,"I always say this is a godsend meditation for me. 
I have been consistent on it for 3ish months. I lost 3 kg (8lbs?) but not magically. I am putting effort on what I eat & I exercise now, it just made it easier.

It helped fix my diarrhetic IBS (ppl say it causes constipation so I think it’s balancing my gut out), that helped my bloating and hence I started to know what is hunger, boredom or just gas! It’s fun to be able to read my stomach better. There is the occasional sickness feeling when starting & increasing the dose, but it goes away soon enough. 

I 100% stopped my emotional eating, stopped my midnight binge habit and it has been so freeing! I still do other distracting dopamine seeking activities that are destructive (shopping, skin picking, binge watching/reading) but no more feeling like I am a slave to my eating habits! I can fight hunger easily and delay meals without going crazy, which is honestly new to me :)"
Beneficial weight loss?,"I’ve been on Strattera for roughly a month. As of today, I’ve lost 7 pounds :) Tbh I have a decent bit of weight to lose anyway. But I have noticed that I’m not overeating AND I’m not snacking, either. Just that alone has helped this weight loss. 

Also my anxiety has been massively cut from almost Dqy One of Strattera. It’s been so incredibly unbelievable. I feel like a new person."
Beneficial weight loss?,I’ve been on it a month and lost about 4 pounds it’s stopped my binge eating and snacking. It’s been great.
Beneficial weight loss?,"I have a really high metabolism. I’ve lost 12 lbs in a month. Some days i just don’t have an appetite to eat at all but mostly i have stopped eating candy. I always eat candy and junk and i have lost the cravings for it since starting strattera. It’s good and bad for me. I’m glad i don’t constantly eat junk anymore. But I’m already a small person so losing 12 lbs can easily make me look like a crack head🤣  
But i love that I’m finally able to control my eating habits where as before i felt like it was too difficult to do so."
Beneficial weight loss?,"i’ve been on it for a month and lost between 8-11 pounds it fluctuates, but it made such a difference in how i feel and how my clothes fit."
Beneficial weight loss?,Not so much weight loss (that I’ve noticed anyway) but it seems to cancel out the weight gain effects of Trintellix lol so that’s a win!
Beneficial weight loss?,"I just compared my weight to when I started on this and found that I lost 20 pounds. I’m on tirzepatide, but was hovering around the same weight for a few months. Maybe this was all I needed. This was over three months."
Beneficial weight loss?,"This is brilliant news, I'm so glad its working for you!"
Beneficial weight loss?,I could have written your comment! Exact same results here. The medicine doesn't cause weight loss - me not seeking dopamine in empty calories is causing me to return to my pre-pandemic weight.
Is Strattera making depressed or is it life?,"Is anything new going on in your life? For me, I just started Strattera as well and also feel depressed, but I think it’s just because my job search lately hasn’t been going well."
Is Strattera making depressed or is it life?,"Same thing here... I'm having such a dark vision of my environment, and perspectives... No idea if this is worse because of Strattera or not."
Is Strattera making depressed or is it life?,"If you guys are having dark thoughts or new depression, YOU MUST ASAP TELL YOUR DOCTOR! You may be at too high a dose, or this medicine is not for you. If you notice something off when it comes to your mental health, please please please say something to a medical professional. This is sadly, one of the many side effects of this drug. Best of luck to you all."
Is Strattera making depressed or is it life?,I was depressed on it till 80 mg kicked in. Then everything lifted and it's perfect now.
Is Strattera making depressed or is it life?,"Strattera can because it's correcting your ADHD, allow you to feel emotions. It's not uncommon to need to go on an antidepressant like mirtazapine to help."
Is Strattera making depressed or is it life?,Yes. I just lowered my dose because of it
Is Strattera making depressed or is it life?,I'm kind of dealing with the same thing. I've been on 40 mg for about 6 weeks and I felt good as first but the past few weeks haven't been good. I've been depressed and irritable. I'm already on an anti depressant and this is now the second ADHD med I've tried so idk what to do.
Is Strattera making depressed or is it life?,"I got off of it because of the same thing..definitely wasn’t normal for me, it was the medication"
Is Strattera making depressed or is it life?,I actually got off Strattera because it was making me incredibly depressed
Is Strattera making depressed or is it life?,I’ve been on it for a month and I feel more emotionless than anything
Is Strattera making depressed or is it life?,"My psychiatrist mentioned that some of his patients have to lower their dose bcz it didn’t suit them. I am considering that, but this med has been a godsend in helping my emotional eating, I easily distinguish between hunger & boredom, it fixed my IBS … so I’m not ready to give up on it yet. But I will ask my doc next appointment"
Is Strattera making depressed or is it life?,"It’s so confusing too, because we are struggling in life to start with … it’s difficult to point out what needs to be fixed!"
Is Strattera making depressed or is it life?,"I don’t want to get off it yet. Great benefits on stopping emotional eating, anxiety and helped with myIBS. 
I did fast base cardio yesterday & stretching today, I feel 10x better. I suspect I just need to prioritize serotonin inducing activities on the daily!"
Is Strattera making depressed or is it life?,Exactly! It's so discouraging. I have an appointment with my psychiatrist today to see what to do about the meds. I also take buspirone for anxiety. It's just hard to figure out what the issue is. I hope you get some relief soon!
Is Strattera making depressed or is it life?,"I hear you, I was enjoying the positive effects as well but for me it was too much negative and not enough positive to justify staying on"
Is Strattera making depressed or is it life?,"I’m so sorry you are struggling. Honestly… I think we just aren’t meant to have this much mental load on us. It doesn’t make sense that we require a cocktail of meds to function. 

At this point I am very close to quitting my job and taking a step a back, I don’t know how would I do that from a financial standpoint but I’m starting to seriously consider it. I feel like I can’t “deliver” anything in this mental state."
Is Strattera making depressed or is it life?,"I'm sorry you are struggling too! It helps to know other people are dealing with the same thing, but I agree. I hate having to take so many medications to feel normal.

If you need to take a step back from your job, do it! I should do the same... But the worst part is, I'm a therapist. So a lot of people depend on me which makes dealing with my own mental health that much more difficult."

Time slowed down ??,"Exactly! I feel the same.

The time was just flowing by. I have started Strattera in the end of September and the two months that passed since then feels like it was 6 months or even a year!

Definitely time slows down on Strattera. The days are more full."
Time slowed down ??,Do you feel like you are more present?
Time slowed down ??,I'm glad you put this into words because I couldn't pinpoint why time was going so slow.
Time slowed down ??,"I noticed the same, it helped a lot going to bed at night. I felt like the day was longer and was tired before 10 instead of normally 12-2am. I've been off it for about 2 weeks because I get nauseous the first day and haven't had a free day to take it where I could lay in bed all day. I've been going to bed a lot later than I was on it and days are flying again."
Time slowed down ??,I tried it for one day - and didn’t feel well.  I’m going to give it a few weeks and try again with a full belly and in the weekend
Time slowed down ??,I’ve also noticed going to sleep a lot easier
Time slowed down ??,Yes but sometimes I’m still impatient like currently at the dmv and it got me really irritable 😭
Time slowed down ??,I had to wait it out and titrate over a time period of almost a year. Now on 80. Miralax everyday and don't give up.
How did you guys deal with the constipation?,"Metamucil. Twice a day, morning and night. Done.

I caught the problem too late and I probably should have taken laxatives, but metamucil works just fine and I can tell within 8 hours if I've skipped one lol"
How did you guys deal with the constipation?,If the bananas aren’t SUPER ripe they’ll make your constipation worse.
How did you guys deal with the constipation?,Also a stool softener once a day is good and not a stimulant or anything.
How did you guys deal with the constipation?,"Tbh, caffeine. And over time it has worked itself out. so really, one little cup of cold brew in the morning and its all regulated by afternoon."
How did you guys deal with the constipation?,"I had diarrhetic IBS … Strattera fixed it, my bloating & my emotional eating. 

But if I felt the slightest constipation I would delay taking the med for that day for a couple of hours. Get coffee & have fruit, be hydrated enough early in the morning and usually things go back on track."
How did you guys deal with the constipation?,"I worked my way up to 2 servings of All Bran Buds per day. I eat it in one sitting as a snack or meal with milk.  You could mix throughout day into other things such as oatmeal, yogurt, smoothies, etc."

How did you guys deal with the constipation?,A lot of prunes

It’ll take a little trial and error, but you’ll get it all figured out I promise. :) Good luck!"
How did you guys deal with the constipation?,"Whole Psyllium Husks, 2-3 tablespoons mixed in a 500ml bottle of water helped the most. I just didn't take it every day, but the days I did, it was a noticeable difference.  you can buy this easily online at Amazon, 

Also, magnesium citrate seemed to help on its own a little, and especially in addition to the psyllium husks.  I took about 300mg/day.

Butt, even with those aides to help the constipation, those logs were like something outta the redwood forest, long, thicc, firm(although I never touched).  I'd have to plunge the toilet after almost every single poo to get it flowing. 

  
I ended up stopping 'strattera' a week ago though.  it took about 3-4 days for my bowel movements to get back to normal-*ish.* same with urination, my weak pressure and slow urination got somewhat back to normal after about 4 days of quitting"
How did you guys deal with the constipation?,"Oh, so *this* is why! 

I've got a bag of psyllium husk that I should really be more consistent with."

How did you guys deal with the constipation?,Or just plain psyllium husks. I don’t like the flavored stuff so that’s what I get.
How did you guys deal with the constipation?,"No, only name brand or you shit rocks!

I've fallen into the name brand trap, haven't I? I meant any of the powder-you-stir-into-water-and-you-poop-good stuff. Personally, I rock some sugar free Kirkland brand because it dissolves the best and doesn't end up like jello too fast."
How did you guys deal with the constipation?,"It took a few days to get regular, but yes, every single day. That was my norm before atomoxetine. As a bonus my LDL dropped and my HDL increased. I got to drop Crestor, a statin drug used for treating high cholesterol."
How did you guys deal with the constipation?,"Psyllium husk is fantastic as well, I agree. I think using a psyllium husk powder is a lot better than capsules. Capsule instructions have to be followed to the letter or they can be useless. And if you use a powder you want to stir it in and chug it before it becomes worse than slime consistency."
How did you guys deal with the constipation?,"It definitely depends on the thing you’re buying. With Metamucil being just a simple psyllium husk I don’t think it matters. But when it comes to generic medications apparently it does matter despite what I was told my entire life. My buddy was in PA school and did some massive research paper on generics. With brand name there is better quality control and they can often have patents on the release mechanism of a drug. Generics have to find their own release mechanism and have fillers, both of which can cause a medication to have an adverse effect on the patient. Not only that but the chemical chains of a generic can sometimes be flipped which makes them “legally correct” but can also cause them to be ineffective.

My insurance through my work has many barriers in place that do not allow me to circumvent the extreme cost of a brand name drug. I think the only way to get the brand name at a reasonable price for me would be if they ran out of generic and had to substitute. I can’t even have my psychiatrist order it with a DAW-1 code to avoid the cost. My stimulant still ends up being over $300 for a month.

Oh and your comment reminded me that “sugar free” stuff like candy that has a sugar replacement often has a laxative effect."
How did you guys deal with the constipation?,Ok! I also need to address those 🥲 thanks for the really nice suggestion! Ill try it :)
How did you guys deal with the constipation?,I mix it with water and have left it too long precisely once. lol
How did you guys deal with the constipation?,"I think its the best that way. its retaining more water, and that is what is helping with the constipation and hydrating the intestines.

  
I would always let mine bulk up a little before drinking it, it was almost like some chineese vending machine food or something. like a squeeze tube of ramen. I;ve never had a squeeze tube of ramen, but that is what it seemed like it would be like."
"3 days taking Atomoxetine 40mg, so far only difficulty peeing.","I have horrific urinary side effects with this drug. They don't really go away, just get more manageable with time."
"3 days taking Atomoxetine 40mg, so far only difficulty peeing.","also on day 3 at 40mg. so far I've sweated my ass off every night but I'm gonna try switching blankets maybe? also, some random tightness in the chest. I do plan to call my doc about that one, but my BP has remained normal."
"3 days taking Atomoxetine 40mg, so far only difficulty peeing.",So is this why I peed on my pants?
"3 days taking Atomoxetine 40mg, so far only difficulty peeing.","I stopped taking this after 4 days myself due to the difficulting peeing, I decided the side effects weren't worth dealing with.  It literally made me feel like I had a UTI constantly, it hurt to pee, and I had to push as hard as possible for anything to come out.  Not to mention, I felt like a 60 year old man down there, I'm 28.  I was also completely emotionless, I couldn't smile at all, and spoke in a monotone voice.  I will say, I did notice that I stopped stimming, and could focus while working on a task, but had 0 motivation to do anything at all.  Also, while on this, I was sleeping about 12-13 hours a night, and woke up as exhausted as ever, I typically get 7-8 hours a night.

I recently got switched to 5mg of adderal taken twice a day, and am starting it tomorrow!"
"3 days taking Atomoxetine 40mg, so far only difficulty peeing.",Bupropion amplifies the strattera. If the side effects are rough you can go lower.
"3 days taking Atomoxetine 40mg, so far only difficulty peeing.","Atomextine has a very short half life. Many people take it 2x a day of it doesn’t work. 

Fyi. Bupropion and Strattera interact.
Just keep that in mind with dosage - you may need less to get the same effectiveness.

The peeing and dry mouth all improve unless you increase the dosage."
"3 days taking Atomoxetine 40mg, so far only difficulty peeing.","A clever combination. A metabolite of sertraline is a weak dat inhibitor. But this would not be significant at a dose of 50 mg anyway. Wellbutrin and sertraline combination is called welloft by foreigners, be on your way, I recommend you to make the earliest evaluation at the end of the 6th week."
"3 days taking Atomoxetine 40mg, so far only difficulty peeing.","I have the peeing issue and my mouth is si dry. I just doubled to 80 today and I've been shaking all day, feels like my cells are fast forwarded and my skin is crawling more than normal."
"3 days taking Atomoxetine 40mg, so far only difficulty peeing.","It seems it already got better for me. On the first day it was difficult, but now it feels pretty normal to me, except when I try peeing after having an orgasm, then it gets... difficult"
"3 days taking Atomoxetine 40mg, so far only difficulty peeing.",Tightness is your chest is bad. Call now.  Also check your bp and HR. It can be really rough on the cardiovascular system (why I stopped).
"3 days taking Atomoxetine 40mg, so far only difficulty peeing.","I have a feeling of tightness in my chest, purely somatic, without physical symptoms. It occurs as a response to anxiety. But it's better to double-check, of course."
"3 days taking Atomoxetine 40mg, so far only difficulty peeing.","This is so far mostly my experience. I’m on week five I think of 40mg. The difficulty urinating is driving me crazy but several people say hang in and it’ll go away. Plus basically all the sexual plumbing isn’t working correctly. It isn’t helping motivate me. In fact I think that’s gotten worse (but may be seasonal depression kicking in). It has tho like you said helped focus and stay on task and not get distracted if I can ever get started on a task. Sleeping has constantly been an issue for me for some time and this seems to keep me up until I finally crash after dawn until sunset. Sweating, dry mouth, headaches that type thing mostly gone or manageable. I think it may be upping panic attacks but I’d expect that at first due to the norepinephrine."
"3 days taking Atomoxetine 40mg, so far only difficulty peeing.","The side effects are no problem. Night sweats atarted recently, and the peeing thing seems to be gone already.
Seetraline and bupropion also had basically zero side effects when i took them, and they started working really fast on me. What a wacky body I have"
"3 days taking Atomoxetine 40mg, so far only difficulty peeing.","isnt it supposed to work 24 hours? how much time does it last in your system? it feels as if it lasts all day since some side effects persist, like dey mouth. Also, for some reason, atomoxetine really helps me with intrusive thoughts. Feels like i dont even have ocd.

What did you mean that i may need a lower dosage to have the same effectivess? doesnt bupropion potentialize atomoxetine, making it stronger? if i had a lower dosage, wouldnt it feel weaker?"
"3 days taking Atomoxetine 40mg, so far only difficulty peeing.","yes, all i hope is that i don't metabolize atomoxetine as fast as i metabolize vyvanse"
"3 days taking Atomoxetine 40mg, so far only difficulty peeing.","I've been on 100mg for years. I'll have great weeks that turn into peeing my pants out of nowhere. So yeah if it gets better for you, I'm happy for you. I get vicious utis and urgency and straight up incontinence for no reason at all."
"3 days taking Atomoxetine 40mg, so far only difficulty peeing.","as stated, my BP and hr are fine. if they weren't, I'd be more concerned."
"3 days taking Atomoxetine 40mg, so far only difficulty peeing.","It does over time and lasts, some people prefer 2x daily. 

It’s brilliant for intrusive thoughts! It works so well for that!"
"3 days taking Atomoxetine 40mg, so far only difficulty peeing.","However, I would like to warn you about the risk of seizures. Everyone's tolerance is different. Using bupropion and atomoxetine at the same time always carries some risk if you are not under the supervision of a doctor. "
"3 days taking Atomoxetine 40mg, so far only difficulty peeing.","did you feel concentration effects immediatelly when you took it on your first day? i already felt something similar to what ritalin does. It feels stronger on my 3rd day, i wonder if it gets even better the more it builds up"
"3 days taking Atomoxetine 40mg, so far only difficulty peeing.","indeed it does, i noticed bupropion also helped with that, but not at the same scale. Maybe norepipephrine is lacking on me. I need to wait and see how Atomoxetine increases dopamine indirectly"
"3 days taking Atomoxetine 40mg, so far only difficulty peeing.",I found unfortunately it made me a bit emotionless at the higher dosages.  I found Wellbutrin added only helped with motivation.
"3 days taking Atomoxetine 40mg, so far only difficulty peeing.","same thing here, regarding motivation. The only thing i need to get now is the patience attribute stimulants give me for a short period of time. My theory is that it's more related to dopamine than norepipephrine"
Is it normal to titrate up so fast?,"Yeah, seems faster than what others usually mention on this subreddit. My doctor recommended me to take 50 mg for a few days and then increase to 80 mg.

I did as he recommended. 50 was not enough to give any positive effects, which I only started getting after being on 80 for a few days. 

It seems that some doctors are very careful with titration, probably because of side effects and for some people it works on lower dosages too.

I preferred getting to the target dosage quickly. I needed symptom relief and I can't imagine starting from 25 mg and taking it for a month before increasing to 50. Would take too much time. 

Beware that the initial side effects can be brutal. I was honestly thinking on giving it up. The first 2 weeks were the worst, but my body got used to them. It was worth sticking with it. "
Is it normal to titrate up so fast?,"I did three days at 40 and then went up to 80! Worked fine for me, a few side effects the first day on each dosage but I just managed with it. Been on it for 5 months now"
Is it normal to titrate up so fast?,"The medication recommendations used to be (for adults) 40mg for 1 week then 80mg, but it recently changed to 3 days. If someone is very underweight or small, then there are recommendations to start a bit lower for tolerance.
The rationale for the fast jump is that the majority of people will get side effects with every single increase regardless and it will most likely take a while for them to adjust. So just jump to the therapeutic dose and wait out the side effects and be at the therapeutic dose instead of dragging it out and adding unnecessary adjustment times. 

I work in psychiatry (nurse) and the guidelines for antipsychotics and antidepressants are doing the same thing- we used to go up really slowly but then people were just sick still while waiting so long to get up to a dose that helps. They noticed in people who were very ill that people rushed treatment on were having adjustment periods the same as with lower doses but then getting better sooner because they were at therapeutic dose the whole time- so as more testing and experience is being done, meds that don’t have very severe side effects, basically you’re just checking for allergies or side effects and then diving in!

Edit to add: didn’t think I’d need to clarify this, but after being accused of being barbaric and trying to kill people… my explanation is for the general prescribing guidelines and is not intended to tell people to go against what their provider has told them to do! Always listen to your PCP!"
Is it normal to titrate up so fast?,I did one week on 40mg and then upped it to 80mg
Is it normal to titrate up so fast?,"My doctor told me the same thing. Ultimately, it’s your choice - I plan on going at least a full week on 40 and then increasing if I’m feeling okay. I prefer to just be slow and steady. I know multiple people who tried 80 and felt worse and went back to 40 for good, and it’s been the sweet spot for them. A lot of neurodivergent people are more sensitive to medications so sometimes the lower dose is more helpful! Just pay attention to your body and do what feels right."
Is it normal to titrate up so fast?,"People metabolize strattera at massively different rates. Some people have a five hour half-life, and some people have a 20 hour half-life. That means the dose that works for you can be wildly different.

20mg kicks my butt pretty hard."
Is it normal to titrate up so fast?,Has it been working for you? How long did it take for it to start working?
Is it normal to titrate up so fast?,"That makes sense, thank you so much for the explanation"
Is it normal to titrate up so fast?,I think you want to kill people. There are people who have anxiety disorder and panic disorder and use this drug. This approach is very barbaric.
Is it normal to titrate up so fast?,"I’m 26F, I’ve never been medicated before so this is all new to me but I noticed a difference pretty quickly. The main benefit I have been experiencing is I don’t have as much “ head clutter” and my anxiety is basically gone. The main side effect for me was drowsiness. I would be exhausted by mid day, to the point I couldn’t keep my eyes open, so I started taking it at night until my body got used to it. I started taking it in the morning again probably around 6 weeks ago and I’m not longer drowsy during the day. I feel motivated, clearer thoughts, and I don’t really have the anxious over thinking. I have still struggled with focusing , distractions, and the adhd burnout. I talked with my doc about a week ago and she added low dose 10mg stimulant and so far that’s has been helping ALOT. Combination therapy isn’t for everyone and I wouldn’t recommend that option until you’ve really assessed where you are and how you’re feeling! I know you’ll see a lot of posts on here about how awful the side effects are but try and work with them/ around them. I hope Strattera works great for you!"
Is it normal to titrate up so fast?,"No where in my response did I suggest everyone do this on their own DESPITE what their provider suggested. 
OP asked for clarification on why their provider prescribed it this way and I’m merely explaining the rationale. Everyone is different which is why it’s important everyone discuss with their provider what’s best for them and follow that. 
Not a fan of you accusing me to trying to kill people… little histrionic."
"11lbs lost, normal?","I've lost a lot of appetite since starting it. It's hard to eat mid day. Eating can be choreish or even unpleasant. I eat a larger breakfast now to try to compensate but I also don't get snacks like I used to, so I'm still losing weight at a slow but steady pace."
"11lbs lost, normal?",I feel like I'm the only person not losing weight on this and I'm really bummed out about it. I've been on it for a few months and am currently on 70mg. Sigh. I get hungrier more now than I used to. I'm also taking dexamphetamine. It makes no sense.
"11lbs lost, normal?","Probably the result of appetite loss. Happened to me too, except I'm already skinny so I'm not anticipating any weight loss."
"11lbs lost, normal?","In addition to suppressing appetite, it may increase heart rate. This leads to burning more active calories than usual."
"11lbs lost, normal?","Over the course of 7 months I lost 15 lbs while on 100mg. Some of that was due to a change in diet but a significant source was my loss of appetite due to the Straterra. Weight loss is definitely common but if you feel it's too much, consider adding in some calorie dense foods or supplements to make up for the difference. Rope your doc into the conversation too."
"11lbs lost, normal?","Yup totally normal. Enjoy the weight loss, once you're to a point that you want to be at, start eating lots of chocolate and ice cream..."
40 to 60mg,"You getting any of the side effects… the bad comes with the good…..


I tried to push 60/80 (went to 100 also), however was just too potent for me and negative stuff way outweighed positive… so settled on 40. 

Higher dose I also feel to suppressed… kind of numbing… lower dose my old happy self shines through a bit easier. 

Good luck!"
40 to 60mg,Constipation is so much worse for ne on 60 mg. It was almost non-existent on 40mg
40 to 60mg,"I just did this jump last week.. was on the 40 mg for a month and switched to the 60mg.. i had no side effects on the 40mg other than mild constipation for the first two weeks then it got better… same as you, i thought it could be just a little bit better so i wanted to try the 60mg… haha i was wrong. The 60 was horrible for me. Although it helped my focus better, the side effects weren’t worth it for me. I felt high almost all day. Like a bad high, not a good one. It kept me from being able to do my job. At the end of the days, i would have melt downs. Like just such anxiety and depression all at once. I would feel numb and quiet throughout the day and then it’s like it would all hit me at once in the evening/ night. And i had bad suicidal episodes the last two days i was trying it.
I was told those side effects would probably go away eventually. But i wasn’t able to handle them even for that short amount of time. I don’t ever deal with depression or suicide normally so i knew it was from the meds. I switched back to my 40mg three days ago and been doing great since. 

If you do try the switch, hopefully it doesn’t do the same for you! Everyone’s different and reacts to meds differently! If you decide to give it a try, just be sure to watch yourself or have someone aware to check on you often until side effects subdue🩷"
40 to 60mg,I’m not having any side effects yet. Last time they hit me day 1 bad.
40 to 60mg,Guess we will see. lol
40 to 60mg,Good to know. I will keep it all in mind. I’m pretty good about knowing what’s going on with my body /mind so I’ll keep an eye out. I’ve had depression so that i could definitely spot.
40 to 60mg,That’s great then!
40 to 60mg,"
Let me know how it goes."
40 to 60mg,So far no issues.

40 to 60mg,Thanks. Hope so too!
I'm back on Effexor ,"Curious what (if any) other meds are you on?

I’ve been 40mg up to 100 and back via 60 and 80 and it def takes time in my experience to see medicine loading up and getting either benefits or side effects….

I don’t have anxiety (it actually fixes my anxiety), until the other day and i tried a Unison for sleep and my god the next day was depressed down to a level I haven’t felt on Strat… found myself watching depressive videos and was tearing up and found comfort in that pain… terrible."
I'm back on Effexor ,"I decided to continue for a few more days since I've only been on 60mg for 1 week.

I take dexedrine with my strattera. 2 x 10mg during the day and at the end of the day, I take my strattera 60mg."
Med change ,"A lot of people find once they start taking medication for their ADHD that autism traits come to the surface, such as special interests. 
Have you found any other traits become more recognizable that may be related?

Anecdotally it does sound like a lot of people go through the side effects again when dose changes occur."
Med change ,"I had the same mg change in mine. I had to stop because my hands would be shaking. Even my toes would do a weird shake. So, I’m back down to 40mg and no side effects."
Med change ,Yes. I was diagnosed with adhd when i was in 3rd grade and ASD diagnosis added to the adhd about 5 years ago! So that makes complete sense. Thank you!
severe depression and overall apathy ,"I'm down to 60mg and I'm feeling the depression too and difficulty doing my task.

severe depression and overall apathy ,I had that issue going from 40 mg to 60mg. The depression was too bad for me to handle just after a week (I’m highly sensitive to meds) so i went back to the 40mg!
severe depression and overall apathy ,"It's been 2 days since I started taking 60mg. I think you have to be aware of the side effects and continue the treatment to see if it improves. 

To be followed if it continues to improve."
severe depression and overall apathy ,wait you think decreasing your dose caused depression? like withdrawal
severe depression and overall apathy ,Sorry i increase to 60mg
severe depression and overall apathy ,gotcha hope it gets better
What is everyone’s resting HR on strattera? ,"My resting heart rate went from 53 to about 63 which is very much in line with much in line with the average expected increase that studies report. Its been higher, but Ive managed to lower it slightly with a lot of walking and working out. I expect I'll be able to lower it further over time with staying active. 

I wear a smartband and monitor my heart rate throughout the day, and its pretty wild to see the big jump. During more active parts of the day my heart rate hovers between 85 and 115. When the medicine kicks in, its not uncommon that my heart rate jumps to 140 for a short while then falls back to more normal levels. My heart rate also spikes much higher now when working out and I need to take slightly longer breaks when lifting weights because I get out of breath easier.

Ive generally seems an increase in heart rate at each dose increase, and its fallen down a little after a couple of months. 

Its all pretty normal according to my psych, as long as blood pressure is in the normal range."
What is everyone’s resting HR on strattera? ,"luckily, zero increases, my resting heart rate has always been lows 50s I have worn a smart watch for almost 5 years, so I was able to compare a lot of years and neither my blood pressure or heart rate had changed thank goodness."
What is everyone’s resting HR on strattera? ,"It’s a good question, I think it’s also worthwhile asking who also drinks a cup (or more) of coffee whilst on the medicine during the daytime. As I know if I do it pushes it up to that 100bpm HR, it’s a bit lower if I don’t consume any caffeine. Exercise also has a dramatic effect on both resting HR and BP. My BP used to be 135+/80+ throughout day and now since adding HIIT workouts over last 6 weeks, my BP hovers around 110/65 all day long. It’s been wild to see that drop but makes me feel better as didn’t like the higher BP"
What is everyone’s resting HR on strattera? ,Mine went up to about 90 resting. The Dr added clonidine to help lower Bp/ hr. As well as it helps with some anxiety and adhd symptoms. It kept me around 80ish. Now after about 3 months I’ve gradually gone back down to around 70ish. It has taken me a long time to adjust to this med but it has also benefited me greatly.
What is everyone’s resting HR on strattera? ,Day 4 of taking 40 mg. Pulse increased from 80 to 95 at rest. I hope it will decrease as I adapt.
What is everyone’s resting HR on strattera? ,My resting went from 49 to around 50-55
What is everyone’s resting HR on strattera? ,Mine sits there too… but we’ve been suspicious of POTS prior to this.
What is everyone’s resting HR on strattera? ,"According to my Fitbit, the average is 76 bpm, and the lowest it's been in the past few years is 70, so not really much different."
What is everyone’s resting HR on strattera? ,Mine went up to around 85-90 bpm from low 80s but then dropped to high 60s/low 70s after I lost weight. I bet if I went off I would go down to low 60s.
What is everyone’s resting HR on strattera? ,I use 40 mg and it usually stays around 80. Very useful topic. Does anyone know when it will be back to normal?
What is everyone’s resting HR on strattera? ,"I’m having a very similar experience. Is there any concern that if we ever go off of it, our bodies will be in shock or need to readjust to pre-straterra levels? If so- is that a painful withdrawal/tapering period?"
What is everyone’s resting HR on strattera? ,What dosage?
What is everyone’s resting HR on strattera? ,"Not that I am aware. As long as you taper down slowly, you should be fine. Stopping any medication abruptly usually is unpleasant to some extent."
What is everyone’s resting HR on strattera? ,40 mg but sometimes I take an additional 20 mg half way through my day.
Atomoxetine side effects,"I have extreme muscle spasms if I lose my pill in the morning. In a days before I crushed porcelain cup in my palm. 9 month, 60 mg. 

As for my first day sides, that was constant ED, tremor, 110+ bpm, emotional numbness and apathy, also with extreme drowsiness. It was way easier on week 2, all of them have gone in 3 month"
Atomoxetine side effects,"muscle aches with atomoxetine yes. Idk about the other. Not serious, but annoying."
Atomoxetine side effects,"Serious muscle aches, yes. They lasted about one week. My period was late by two weeks after taking it but I wouldn't chalk that up to the medication entirely and just my body being strange. However Strattera can cause menstrual irregularities in some people, I'd ask your doctor about it just to be safe."
Atomoxetine side effects,Strattera took my muscle aches and spasms away but caused my stomach to bloat so badly I looked 9 months pregnant
Anyone here on 90 mg Strattera?,"I'm on 80, but just want to let you know that there is a possibility that your heart rate will go down again slightly over time. Mine increased with each dose increase, but is very close to where I was initially. So unless it's at dangerous levels, then I'd try it out for a while."
Anyone here on 90 mg Strattera?,I appreciate your input. I will keep that in mind and talk to my doctor about it.
Advice: Stopping Strattera,"I stopped about 7 days ago.   I was on 80mg/day for about 2.5 months, then went to 0.  On about the third day I noticed that the side effects(constipation, slow/weak urination, turtle-dick, hives) atomoxetine was giving me started to go away.  I didnt suffer any quitting cold turkey, and my doctor didn't mention any waning off"
Advice: Stopping Strattera,How high was your HR?
Advice: Stopping Strattera,"After starting the 80 mg (3 days ago), my heart rate increased by 15 bpm. For now, I’m taking a beta-blocker in the minimum dose (bisoprolol 1.25 mg once a day), and my heart rate is normal. I hope that in a few weeks, my heart rate will decrease, and I won’t need the beta-blocker anymore."
Advice: Stopping Strattera,"I don’t want to speak out of turn against what your doctor has advised you, but this just sounds like a way to extend your side effects. A lot of what’s online about this is that you don’t need to taper off in the same way you do with other medications you may be likely to have tried. I certainly wasn’t told to do this.  But if you’re going to do it, and of course I don’t advise against it since it’s what you’ve been advised to do by the person in charge of your care, I think the best thing would just be to make sure you take it easy and don’t put too many demands on yourself during the days that you’re tapering off. I know that may be easier said than done and you may have nonnegotiable obligations, but it would be my main thought on it. It’s about a month or so since I took a break from taking it and my resting heart rate is still messing me around a fair bit, confusingly! I hope it goes well for you, and I’m sorry that you couldn’t continue taking it when it was offering you clear benefits."
Advice: Stopping Strattera,It was consistently right around 100 even while sitting down. Lowest it would get would be like 98.
Advice: Stopping Strattera,I hope so too! It is probably beneficial that you didn’t have issues beforehand with all of that—wishing you luck🙏🙏
Advice: Stopping Strattera,"Hi this is really helpful! Did you just stop altogether? I agree it seems easier…I had such side effects ever to start this so I would imagine stopping is not fun, but would be better for it to just get over with. I also feel validated hearing someone else had heart rate issues! I hope yours regulates soon😔"
Advice: Stopping Strattera,"I was curious about this also. And now more curious as resting for an adult should be between 60-100 so somewhat within range.

What are you planning on switching to (if anything). And do you know if that medicine is likely to raise your HR?

Did you doc (or you), check your blood pressure also when Strattera was taken and in your system at fuller strength a few hours later, cause I’m sure that would be up also. I’m just not sure what meds don’t bring HR and BP up slightly.

What was your base HR so you know before Strattera?"
Advice: Stopping Strattera,"Thank you, good luck to you too! Strangely enough, after starting the beta blocker, all my side effects from atomoxetine 80 mg immediately disappeared (poor sleep, anxiety, fatigue, tachycardia). I feel just as usual now."
Advice: Stopping Strattera,"Oh I’m glad! I’ll link you to me talking about it a few days ago ☺️ https://www.reddit.com/r/StratteraRx/comments/1gr4yct/comment/lx6ivtm/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button    Did you try stimulants first? I’m in the UK & with my titration route, it has been: “try these two different stimulants, then try atomoxetine….none of them suit you? Oh well 🤷‍♀️“, so that hasn’t been much fun. I wasn’t expecting miracles, but I was hoping not to have to continue to rawdog a condition that hid in plain sight for four decades, derailing everything in its path! 😩 We’ll see…it’s strange, you get all the Big Pharma talk, but I don’t feel like I’m swimming in options here. Do you think you’ll taper off?"
Advice: Stopping Strattera,"I’m not switching to anything right now, we are gonna reassess how I feel once it’s out of my system first before adjusting! 

I didn’t consistently read my BP, even though I should have. I have had high BP since I was 19 as it is hereditary on both sides. I typically can just feel when it’s high….my base heart rate is usually mid 70s so above 100 was noticeable for me"
Advice: Stopping Strattera,"So interesting! My psych never offered stimulants since I have anxiety induced high blood pressure and take a Xanax prescription. So this was really my only option in the USA without completely switching my entire regimen. (I take Prozac as my main one).
Feeling so weird about it all since I did get mental benefits but I know that heart rate just is not appropriate especially with my blood pressure problems. Not really knowing where to turn next other than slight increase in Prozac….any tips would be much appreciated😅"
Advice: Stopping Strattera,"How long you been on meds or is this your first? I’ve done stimulants (that will def work the system), and basically all the meds under the sun, on the 40mg Strat and I found HIIT exercise will bring the BP down significantly and resting HR also.

The other thing I’ve noticed if I take the medicine with high protein (as people suggested), it’s seems to help also (i slam it with a protein shake early AM after workout)."
Advice: Stopping Strattera,You have a good Psych and I would agree with this re: stimulants.
Advice: Stopping Strattera,"Are you able to do things to get your BP better?  Maybe see if your doctor can put you on some blood pressure medication(if you aren't already), make some changes to help lower your BP, then ask about a stimulant."
Advice: Stopping Strattera,Yes I have it well managed with medicine and I so lifestyle things to help with it too…maybe when my heart rate calms back down I could ask and see?
Advice: Stopping Strattera,"Yes, it would definitely be worth a try."
Advice: Stopping Strattera,Talk to your doc about Guanfacine.
