Really upset with my psychiatrist for never suggesting Dexedrine. ,Dexedrine was a very popular (and often misused) stimulant for much of the 20th century.  Some doctors may shy away from prescribing it initially because it has that rep and it's more easily abused/diverted.
Really upset with my psychiatrist for never suggesting Dexedrine. ,"Just to reassure you, there is currently no peer-reviewed evidence stimulants taken at therapeutic levels for ADHD have any negative effect on the heart in healthy people. They can increase average heart rate and blood pressure, but not enough to have any negative health effects unless you already have heart disease, which is a different question altogether.

A recent study of 2,000 people (not yet peer reviewed) found about 0.72% of people who took ADHD stimulants for 10 years developed cardiomyopathy compared to 0.53% in the control group. 

This is a correlation, not proven to be causation, and Dr Barkley (ADHD expert) doesn't consider the study clinically significant. 

That's about the closest to evidence of ""heart damage"" we have at the moment. Even that study admitted there was no need to even test people for it.

Edit: A link to the study is available here: https://youtu.be/tPzLFldMPGo?si=9Ty7X-RxIFn1gx86"

Really upset with my psychiatrist for never suggesting Dexedrine. ,"After Ritalin gave me insane migraines if I didn't drink water like a horse, my psych decided to try out dex for me. It made me feel literally unmedicated. I immediately struggled with time management and motivation, catching the bus, going to my classes, being social there, wrapping my brain around life. I really wasnt happy with it, and at a higher dose it made me feel like my brain was hurtling like a train out of control. My best friend, also with adhd, took dex, and while it really helped with their productivity, it made their moods spiral out of control and gave them insane anxiety and paranoia.

I got on vyvanse last year and it's been such an awesome improvement to my day to day life and gives me so so so much more control over my passions and career. Even though dex is another form of vyvanse, vyvanse helps massively, while dex did *very* little.

I was taking Seroquel for insomnia for a year or two and it really seemed like the holy grail for me, but then I went off it and had the most insane insomnia I've ever experienced where I was lucky to get 3 hours of sleep a night for a month, and it turned out there was a 1$billion lawsuit against it's manufacturers for being a terrible, terrible drug prescribed willynilly for insomnia despite being an antipsychotic, and people can have *years* of severe sleep issues after stopping it. So! I wouldn't necessarily feel like this is the holy grail you've missed out on. People's bodies and brains are different. Medications can affect you differently, and somebody mentioned a reason why dex isn't given as much these days down below. There's a chance that dex could do not much, or way too much. Definitely worth checking out, but I wouldn't start grieving for lost potential yet."
Really upset with my psychiatrist for never suggesting Dexedrine. ,"I don't know if this is relevant but did you know you can open a Vyvanse pill, dissolve the contents in water and therefor drink only half a dose (keep the other half for another day) if you feel like your normal dose is too high? For me this also cuts down on the time it's effective. And I know it sounds strange but it is literally mentioned in the leaflet, in Europe at least."
Really upset with my psychiatrist for never suggesting Dexedrine. ,"Lots of misinformation/misunderstandings in this thread.   
  
Vyvanse is a dextroamphetamine prodrug that requires enzymes in the body to “activate” it. The active metabolite is dextroamphetamine.  
  
Adderall is a mixture of different amphetamine salts.  

In adderall, a little more than 75% of the amphetamine is dextroamphetamine. Dextroamphetamine is a more potent psychostimulant."

Really upset with my psychiatrist for never suggesting Dexedrine. ,"I’m on Dexedrine and I keep forgetting to take it every four hours. In some ways, I’d much prefer to be on something like Vyvanse that I only needed to remember to take once a day. The grass is always greener…."
Really upset with my psychiatrist for never suggesting Dexedrine. ,"I’m going to hijack your post for a rant of my own. I believe your anger to be misdirected. The fault here does not completely lie with the psychiatrist. Did you know that there is genetic testing available to determine what psychiatric medications are better/worse for treating a whole host of mental illnesses? These tests are by no means perfect but they reduce the possibilities from say 100 treatment options to maybe 50 or even 25. This test, at least for me and the time I took it, was inconclusive for some of the more popular ADHD meds. These tests will improve over time. That improvement is slow going because insurance companies are reluctant to pay for this testing. I have damn good insurance that pays for almost everything, but even my insurance required extra documentation to allow testing. I am classified as somewhat treatment resistant. In my mind, these tests should be done whenever a patient is first diagnosed with any mental illness. If that were the case, sufficient data might be available to pinpoint the right combination of medications for you. Instead, insurance companies are forcing doctors to guess at the best course of treatment. Trial and error. 

There are more genetic tests available that would be very helpful for all kinds of doctors, but insurance companies will not allow them. There are simple blood tests that can diagnose many illnesses, physical and mental, but doctors are not allowed to use them because insurance companies won’t pay. Doctors are forced to diagnose, in many cases, by relying on patient reported, subjective symptoms. The technology is available to pinpoint some of these diagnoses or eliminate some diagnoses by objective blood, brain, or genetic markers. Just not paid for by insurance."
Really upset with my psychiatrist for never suggesting Dexedrine. ,"For what it’s worth, questions like this are where the pharmacist can be really helpful. (The actual PharmD not the tech.) You can ask to talk to them when you pick up meds. They can also check for interactions based on other medications you take, and take that into account when suggesting potential alternatives. Doctors (and PAs and NPs) don’t get the same amount of training on the pharmacology - it’s a different body of knowledge."

Your psychiatrist might practice in a way that you need to try first line medication before they will prescribe a second line medication.

Really upset with my psychiatrist for never suggesting Dexedrine. ,"Adderall is a mixed amphetamine product containing a ratio of 3:1 dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine. A 30mg pill of Adderall contains about 22.5mg of dextroamphetamine and 7.5mg levoamphetamine. Mixed amphetamine salt products, prior to their use in ADHD, were heavily marketed as weight loss drugs under the brand name Obetrol."

Really upset with my psychiatrist for never suggesting Dexedrine. ,I got put on Vyvanse because my insurance required step therapy for Dexedrine first. My APRN said she can rarely get it covered for anyone.
Really upset with my psychiatrist for never suggesting Dexedrine. ,"I recently got an rx for dextroamphetamine and I really like it. I was on Vyvanse for years. Tried Adderall before that, and Ritalin before Adderall. Vyvanse was good for a while, and I felt like it would be effective for a handful of hours before wearing off. But later I started to suspect that even though I didn't \*feel\* like it was working in the later hours, that it might have been impacting my sleep duration and quality.

I also was kind of annoyed that I had to wait 2 hours before Vyvanse would kick in. And I didn't really like waking up, taking it, and going back to sleep just so it would be in effect by the time I woke up. I did some googling because I knew Vyv wasnt quite the same feeling as Adderall. Found Dex and brought it up to my provider.

We talked about it. She lowered my Vyvanse dose and prescribed me Dextroamphetamine to take along with it in the morning at the same time. So I get going much quicker now (within \~30 minutes), which is nice. And I don't have to dose throughout the day because when dex wears off, I still have a little bit of Vyvanse hanging out. Not sure yet if its helping my sleep, which I already struggle with in general. Will continue to tweak till I find something that works for me."
Really upset with my psychiatrist for never suggesting Dexedrine. ,"When it comes to doctors, probably better served being obsessive about your health.


Your primary care is an air traffic controller, who just points you to the right specialists.


Each specialist has different experiences and experience levels that shape what they're capable of doing. 


I might be mistaken but isn't it lexdexedeine for the generic version of Vyvanse (which is horrifyingly difficult to find now)"
Really upset with my psychiatrist for never suggesting Dexedrine. ,"Dexedrine is considered stronger than adderall, so if adderall was giving you heart issues, I'd guess the doctor was concerned dexedrine would be worse. 


If your doctor is sensing your ""fury,"" obsession, health paranoia, and mistrust as you mentioned, I'm sure that wouldn't make them more likely to prescribed it, either, given the heart risks and risk of abuse. "
Really upset with my psychiatrist for never suggesting Dexedrine. ,"I also was on Vyvanse for a long time because Adderall gave me really bad side effects. But it really did a lot more for my ADHD than Vyvanse ever did.

Really upset with my psychiatrist for never suggesting Dexedrine. ,Dexedrine is very interesting. I’ve been taking it for two years. I don’t feel it at all when I take which means it genetically a fit for me. It allowed me to get of Klonopin after 13 years merely through a moment of epiphany. It reduced my cannabis intake by 2/3. Dexedrine also reduced my Dexedrine intake by half. It’s slowly working is way out of a job.

That med has more reported side effects and more ineffectiveness than the ones given—doc should key trying to find things that work but I’m not sure it’s a surprise it didn’t occur to them to try that first.

Dexadrine IR isn’t really to Vyvanse as Adderall IR is to XR. Though I’m actually surprised he never tried Adderall XR (which may have less side effects than IR and lasts less time than Vyvanse on average). "

Really upset with my psychiatrist for never suggesting Dexedrine. ,"I thought Adderall is IR Vyvanse, Dexedrine being a different med?"
Really upset with my psychiatrist for never suggesting Dexedrine. ,"Like you said, *some* psychiatrists might feel that instant-release dextroamphetamine is the most recreational formulation of amphetamine, and thus prefer other formulations like mixed amphetamine salts.   

But I don’t know if the difference in prescription frequency can be attributed mostly or entirely to this stigma.  
  
Instead, I think the major factor was Shire’s desire to have a patent on their ADHD drug (racemic amphetamine was too old at the time). The special salt mixture made it a unique product worthy of a patent.  
  
 At the time, the various salts were marketed to physicians as a type of rudimentary time-release mechanism, extending the duration of action.   
   

And levoamphetamine might extend the duration of dextroamphetamine by competing for metabolic enzymes (levo takes a little longer to metabolize than dextro so it sort of “gums up the works”).   

They also argued the levo-amphetamine component improved the efficacy of the drug vs dextro-only formulations. In some animal models, for example, Levo-amphetamine is better for hyperactivity symptoms.   
  
With the patent in hand, and the rise in ADHD diagnoses in the 90s, Shire was absolutely printing money. This allowed them resources to further market their drug, and Adderall became a household name."

Really upset with my psychiatrist for never suggesting Dexedrine. ,"Would you happen to know how this would fit someone who has bad cardiovascular health? I've been diagnosed with ADHD for a year now, struggled with depression so much in my life that I hardly do exercise. I bought an Apple Watch a few years ago and noticed that every morning it gives me an alarm that my heart rate goes below 50BPM in the last third of my sleep. This is usually the case with overweight people or athletes, but I was neither 🤔 My doctor had me tested for sleep apnea which wasn't the case. I'm just curious if in my case a stimulant might actually make my physical health better because generally I have a lower blood pressure and a low heart rate"
Really upset with my psychiatrist for never suggesting Dexedrine. ,"Frankly, without stimulant medication in some form, I can't keep myself to an exercise routine and end up with much worse blood pressure, higher heart rate, etc. So while chemically it might directly correlate to higher bp/hr in the short term, long-term the emergent property of more aerobic exercise makes it healthier for me, and I'm diagnosed with hypertension."

This appears to be the study presented at the conference, and to which Dr Barkley refers in the video. Unfortunately it’s a bit skeletal (since it was a conference paper talk type of thing?) but better than the media puff piece linked from the YouTube description. 

A minor correction to your comment, if you’ll forgive me: it wasn’t a study of 2,000 people. It was a study of 12,759 matched pairs (25,518 people). One of the authors, in the media puff piece, used a hypothetical population of 2,000 to illustrate that the risk was overall not very great in terms of additional people developing cardiomyopathy. 

> **Results**
> 
> 12,759 pairs with a decade-long record were matched. The prevalence of cardiomyopathy was 0.36% in the one-year stimulant group and 0.31% in the non-stimulant group (p=0.003). This steadily increased to 0.72% in the 10-year stimulant group and 0.53% in the non-stimulant group (p=0.048). The odds of cardiomyopathy were 1.17-fold higher in the one-year stimulant group (OR 95% CI: 1.06 - 1.30), increasing to 1.57-fold at eight years (OR 95% CI: 1.25 - 1.97) and slightly decreasing to 1.37-fold at ten years (OR 95% CI: 1.002 - 1.88).

I love that lower CI bound for the 10-year OR, it’s sooo close to not being a statistically valid increase at all hey. 

There do seem to have been a few of these types of “ADHD and cardivascular risks” papers recently. It’s become a concern for me because they’re already altering the prescribing environment in my Australian state via Health Dept policy – prescribers are apparently being discouraged from prescribing a ‘booster’ dose after vyvanse etc (i.e. >1 “daily dose”). 

Any thoughts on these studies in particular?

Really upset with my psychiatrist for never suggesting Dexedrine. ,2000 people.. say 50% control group.. 1000 people on stimulants 7.2 got cardiomyopathy instead of 5.3 in the control group? Something like that seems well within random variation?

Really upset with my psychiatrist for never suggesting Dexedrine. ,"I don’t have heart disease as far as anyone’s been able to diagnose. I’m young, healthy, and active, though I’ve always had a bit of a higher heart rate (I’m also very short and have low blood pressure). When I take Vyvanse, my heart rate, usually in the 80s-90s goes to the 110s-120s (tachycardia being anything over 100bpm). I’ve talked about it with my PCP and psychiatrist and both are slightly concerned but said I could continue to take Vyvanse without any other symptoms.

I know you can’t give medical advice, but do you know of any studies specific to longterm tachycardia, either with or without stimulant use? I would like to add to my own reading (I’m a medical professional as well) and possibly bring it to the attention of my provider if something seems concerning. I’ve tried my own searches but haven’t found much so far. If you happen to have come across some that might apply to my situation, would you please share their titles?

Really upset with my psychiatrist for never suggesting Dexedrine. ,"I'm 12+ hours of effectiveness with Vyvanse. I have to remember to take it within an hour of waking up or else I'll end up having insomnia. 

Btw have you gotten your vitamin levels checked? Vyvanse is affected by low Vitamin B and D levels. Also low zinc and iron levels. 

Vyvanse also does best with a moderate to high protein diet. Minimum 0.8g of protein per kg of ideal body weight with at least 20g of protein when you first take it."
Really upset with my psychiatrist for never suggesting Dexedrine. ,"Yeah that's a lot.. it takes 1,5 hours to start working for me.. so usually it begins to work after eight... after three in the afternoon I start yawning and get really tired.."
Really upset with my psychiatrist for never suggesting Dexedrine. ,"I’m sorry to hear that. Sometimes around hour 8 or 10 I might have a small cup of coffee (coffee actually works when I’m on my adhd meds!!!). 

But also I find that the focus and flow I get into during the first 8 hours can carry over even after the medication starts wearing off. If I take the medication and don’t get engrossed in my work, and instead I’m letting myself go on social media or do something unproductive, it seems to wear off way faster. 

So I think me getting really deep into work as the medication is coming on is what makes my focus last so long on it. Like it carries over then even if it’s worn off."

Really upset with my psychiatrist for never suggesting Dexedrine. ,Whats the name of the test?
Really upset with my psychiatrist for never suggesting Dexedrine. ,"Current genetic tests like you describe are mostly hype.   
  
There isn’t a test out there that can tell you “The best drug for your depression is paroxetine and the best drug for your ADHD is dextroamphetamine instead of adderall”. But the companies that sell the tests certainly want you to think that is the type of resolution that is available.  
  
The best we can do is identify genetic mutations that impact drug metabolism. For example, some people don’t get any pain relief from certain opioid prodrugs because they can’t metabolize the compound into its active form.  
  
It’s currently far cheaper and more effective to test how drugs work in a patient empirically (by giving them the drug and adjusting the dose based on their response) rather than relying entirely on theory and the limited data we get from genetic tests."
Really upset with my psychiatrist for never suggesting Dexedrine. ,"Interesting, thanks. I always feel hesitant asking the pharmacist questions because I don’t want to take up too much of their time, maybe I’ll try talking to them more if it’s not busy when I pick up my medication."

Really upset with my psychiatrist for never suggesting Dexedrine. ,I work in outpatient psych and never seen it prescribed
Really upset with my psychiatrist for never suggesting Dexedrine. ,"A minor correction/addition (only because I like pharmaceutical formulations and thought you might be interested):  
  
The 3:1 ratio of salts is by mass. Since each salt has a different molar mass, equal amounts (eg, 5 mg) of Salt A and Salt B will contribute different amounts of amphetamine base.   
  
As a result, the amphetamine in adderall is >75% dextroamphetamine."
Really upset with my psychiatrist for never suggesting Dexedrine. ,"Sort of, but not exactly.   
  
Adderall is a mixture of amphetamine salts, and dextroamphetamine makes up the majority of that mixture (~76%).   
  
The remainder is levoamphetamine which has more peripheral effects (heart rate, blood pressure, motor, etc), might last a little longer than dextro, and might be a little better for hyperactivity symptoms of ADHD.   
  
So the drugs are slightly different — though I suspect not enough to make a world of a difference like the OP is experiencing; I think that can mostly be explained by a difference in dose or the formulation being more agreeable with OP’s biology.  
  
The preferred term for generic adderall is “mixed amphetamine salts”, but pharmacies can have their own terms. Mine calls it “Dextroamp-amphetamin 10 mg”, because another way to think of it is 50% dextroamphetamine and 50% racemic amphetamine (racemic means it’s half dextro and half levo)."

Really upset with my psychiatrist for never suggesting Dexedrine. ,"I would definitely ask your doctor and psychiatrist about it! Some people naturally have a slow heartbeat, but everyone has their own healthy range. 

If this is a recent development, it's definitely worth checking into further. If it's always been that way, I wouldn't be concerned.

Stimulants have a fairly small effect on those vital signs generally. The increase for heart rate for example is between 1 and 5 beats per minute, while blood pressure tends to go up just 1-6 mmHg. Not particularly significant changes."
Really upset with my psychiatrist for never suggesting Dexedrine. ,"I think I can speak on this a little bit.

TLDR; Vyvanse indirectly made my physical health better by treating my comorbid binge eating disorder, and helping me not be nearly as depressed, which led me to getting a job where I am much healthier physically.

I have had a galaxy watch to track my fitness for a few years now, and I've only been diagnosed and medicated for a bit over a year now. I used to be fairly overweight and inactive with poor cardiovascular health. I'm on 60mg of vyvanse currently, and I have been cleaning pools for the past year and a half, which is a surprisingly good cardio workout when you do it for 8 hours a day. Throughout this whole time, from being overweight and unmedicated, to overweight and medicated, to where I am now with medication and a fairly healthy and active body, my resting heartrate while sleeping has always stayed around the high 40s and low 50s. I'm no doctor, and it varies from person to person, but as long as your heart rate isn't going below 40, it's normal for your heart rate to be below 60 while sleeping."
Really upset with my psychiatrist for never suggesting Dexedrine. ,"I'm currently waiting to hear back from my psych about a diagnosis and hopefully get something that can help, but this is my thinking too.

I am an unregulated, inconsistent mess. If stimulants will help keep me on track with exercise, keep me consistent with healthy eating, and let me actually focus and get things done so I'm not constantly stressing about it, even if they do have negative effects on the heart, I'll take that higher quality of life in a heartbeat over a lower quality of life with a shorter life span from negative coping routines."
Really upset with my psychiatrist for never suggesting Dexedrine. ,Your experience reflects the research. These medications provide so many health benefits for us.
Really upset with my psychiatrist for never suggesting Dexedrine. ,"Thank you for the clarfication, I appreciate it! I'm also in Australia, I'm hoping the NDIS inquiry for ADHD will bear some fruit for us in the next few years. 

To be clear, I'm not a medical professional. I'm actually a journalist that writes about biotechnology research among other things. 

That said, and admitting I am only skimming these papers, the first linked paper by Holt et al. doesn't mention anything about controlling for predisposition or lifestyle factors. Research shows people with ADHD are about 70% more likely to develop obesity than the general population, which is a much more important factor in heart health than medication. 

The increases are also very small. 1.7% stroke incidence in prior users compared to 2.1% in daily users, heart failure is 0.7% vs 1.2% and composite risk is 3% compared to 3.9%.

The second paper by Le Zhang et al. does control for at least 5 factors including age and sex, but I note they have no data on participants' relative diets, exercise habits, or alcohol/tobacco intake, which again are vitally important risk factors for heart disease. 

Also, a 23% increase at the 5 year+ mark sounds significant, but if we apply that to the true risk to the population we go from 6.7 in every 100 people developing CVD to 8.2 per 100. Not a particularly large change.

The relative increases appear to be quite small in both studies, which I would argue is outweighed by the health benefits of taking medication even if the data is accurate."

They put medications into “green” (no genetic contraindications), “yellow” (some concerns but not necessarily a “do not use” and “red” (do not use / high concern”. 

To be honest, neither we or the doctor found the test very useful and it was $350 because no insurance I have seen pays for it. 

Not to say you shouldn’t look into it, but I found it to be a waste of money (or $ spent trying to do everything we could to help our kid, and it was yet another dead end)."

Really upset with my psychiatrist for never suggesting Dexedrine. ,"No that makes sense.


my understanding how it works is unlike normal stimulants messing with your brain chemistry directly, Vyvanse works after the brain/body breaks down the drug.


Adderall and other conventional stimulants are adding more sugar. (Stimulation) Which for us has the paradoxical effect of making it easier to focus."
Really upset with my psychiatrist for never suggesting Dexedrine. ,"Yep! I've been on and off dex since 1999 or so, and it's one of the only stimulant meds that doesn't aggravate my weird heartbeats."
Really upset with my psychiatrist for never suggesting Dexedrine. ,"Thats what I thought when I first started taking it, but dexedrine is considered ""stronger"" *because* it is just the dextro instead of the mixed salts. 


(That being said, Adderall may be more *effective* because the l-amphetamine seems to affect more parts of the body. Also, individuals may feel Adderall more intensely, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's ""stronger."") 


Multiple sources, including addiction treatment centers, will tell you roughly the same thing: 


""As the strongest component of amphetamine (another stimulant), dextroamphetamine has a stronger side effect than amphetamine and medications that contain it. As a result, comparisons of Dexedrine and Adderall show that Dexedrine is stronger....Dexedrine is composed of dextroamphetamine sulfate. Adderall, on the other hand, is made of a combination of amphetamine salts. Additionally, Dexedrine is stronger than Adderall. Dexedrine contains a more potent form of amphetamine, dextroamphetamine.""


""Dextroamphetamine is a more potent Central nervous system (CNS) stimulant than levoamphetamine, but levoamphetamine has slightly stronger cardiovascular and peripheral effects and a longer elimination half-life than dextroamphetamine."""

I unfortunately don't know how recent that change is, I know that 6 years ago (I'm 29 now) my girlfriend at the time woke me up in the middle of the night once because she thought I died in my sleep.

Why won’t doctors prescribe dexedrine?,"Another name for Dexedrine is ""Dextrostat"" 

My own doc tried to switch me to Adderall after 25+ years of being on Dexedrine (I was first diagnosed as an adult in the mid 1990's)   
Adderall is definitely not for me. 

I asked to go back on Dexedrine - that is working as it's supposed to.   
Have another talk with your doctor and pointedly ask why it's not an option for you.   
If it's a general refusal without explanation - demand the doc puts into your record their refusal to consider Dexedrine and why."
Why won’t doctors prescribe dexedrine?,"Of course he knows what dex is. He's probably playing dumb. IME asking a doctor for a narcotic is kind of a faux pas. Even if your relationship with them is good. Possibly the doc says yes if you have an excellent relationship with them and show little or no signs of potential to abuse. I've had that happen once with a doctor I knew for 15 years. I asked for a benzo. Then he got suspicious. Eventually switched doctors. It's not worth it. I'd stick with the Vyvanse program and then tell doctor it's expensive and making symptoms worse (if it is) then from there he would prescribe something else, possibly Dexedrine. Since you were on adderall before it makes sense to switch to Dexedrine if Vyvanse does not work. But dex can be abused which is a problem if someone was an addict before."
Why won’t doctors prescribe dexedrine?,"I just had this same conversation with my psychiatrist. Vyvanse is too expensive for me, and I asked about Dexedrine. It felt like the environment changed and his nurse started asking me questions and I felt like I was being interrogated. I’ve always trusted my dr and he’s never made me feel that way, even when we had to make changes to my medications every month. But asking about Dexedrine seemed to be the wrong thing. We ended up on Ritalin LA, but I left the appointment feeling like I did something wrong."
Why won’t doctors prescribe dexedrine?,"My doctor didn't know what dexedrine was, either. When I told him the active ingredient is dextroamphetamine, he tried writing me off by saying ""that's the same ingredient as Adderall"". But when I insisted it was different, he pulled out his phone and googled it. Dexedrine is ONLY dextroamphetamine, while adderall is a mix of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine. I believe dexedrine is the extended release name brand, but there is an instant release name brand by ZENZEDI. Your doctor may be playing dumb because, according to the first result on Google that my Dr saw, it is supposedly stronger than Adderall. 

(as a side note, my insurance only covers the generic, so my doctor had to submit the script as dextroamphetamine sulfate 15 mg XR)"
Why won’t doctors prescribe dexedrine?,"I also live in the US and years ago took Dexedrine which is extended release dextroamphetamine, but it didn’t work so I went back on Adderall IR for years until the shortage happened in my area in October last year, my doctor put me on Zenzedi which is instant release dextroamphetamine. Maybe try asking about that instead? I did have to go back on Ritalin for a month which didn’t work for me at all before my doctor put me on the Zenzedi. It’s really just not that common I think, and for some reason has more abuse potential than Adderall? However it has given me way less side effects than Adderall because it’s missing the levoamphetamine part..it’s probably the best ADHD medication I’ve ever been on aside from Vyvanse which is also too expensive/not covered by my insurance. Good luck if you’re able to get it though, I just spent 2 hours calling 18 different pharmacies and it looks like there’s a shortage of all amphetamine medications in my area. This shortage really sucks"

Why won’t doctors prescribe dexedrine?,"I was just prescribed Dexedrine by my psychiatrist, who said it works better than Adderall.  If you look at the ratings for the two drugs on Drugs.com, it gets a much higher rating than Adderall. I think the problem may be that it was synthesized in 1937,and developed a bad rep along the way that lingers.  Other formulations, like Adderall, are modifications that usually don't work as well. 

You may have to find a doctor, usually a psychiatrist, to prescribe it for you.  Once prescribed, you can often get a family doctor to continue with medicatoon maintenance .  

It's worth the trouble in terms of an improved life.  The more people insist on it, the more available it will become.

It's so stupid to have to jump thru hoops or educate your doctors. But I suspect they know it's available. Your best bet is a psychiatrist or a psychiatric nurse practitioner."
Why won’t doctors prescribe dexedrine?,"Dexedrine was formulated in 1937.  Certainly generic now and not profitable for the drug companies.

Why won’t doctors prescribe dexedrine?,"I take Dexedrine, up to 40mg/day. It definitely works better than Vyvanse IME. It is harder to come by than adderall though, and many pharmacies will confuse it with adderall which is annoying.

It’s also expensive as shit because the doses they offer are so limited. I take 40mg/day so that’s 4 10mg spansules — 120/mo and I pay OOP. Without GoodRX it would be like $400 to fill that prescription.

Long story short, ask for ""Zenzedi"" or generic dextroamphetamine sulfate (available in 5 and 10mg) not ""Dexedrine"".

For me: Dexedrine clears my head enough that I can attend to tasks at hand that I otherwise would not want to pay attention to. I can still get sleepy while it's in effect, but overall it clears my head and helps keep intrusive thoughts out. 

My doc decided I should try Adderall about 3 years ago.   
I tried it for one day - I felt like I was moving through syrup and could barely see what was in front of me.   
At work - I sat at my desk for 3 hours. Just sat - no thinking, no buzzing, no browsing the internet, not even getting work done - just sat. I did not realize 3 hours had passed until someone came to my office and snapped me out of it. I had no realization that 3 hours had passed. When I got home I sat in the driveway for 20 mins before my wife came out and knocked on the window - I had no idea that time had passed.   
It was frightening.

I didn't like Adderall because it made me angry and it made my hands shake. I didn't like Vyvanse because it only lasted a few hours, the crash was horrible when it wore off, and it was very inconsistent from one day to the next.

Dex doesn't have any of those problems. It's smoother than Adderall, no irritability, no jittery feeling, just calm focus. I don't feel a crash when it wears off. One dose lasts 5-6 hours (longer than Vyvanse, which is supposed to last all day), so I take one dose in the morning and one in the afternoon.

I did try Adderall first but I found the ""come down"" made me emotional/anxious and was unpleasant. Vyvanse keeps my emotions even-keel."
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,"Vyvanse is supposed to last around as long as XR d-amphetamine and XR adderall if they are all at equivalent dosages. If vyvanse doesn’t last as long for you as XR formulations of amphetamine then just take the XR , and it’s because there is variation in the way people metabolize these formulations. Whether it’s XR d-amphetamine or the XR amphetamine formulation inside adderall isn’t going to effect duration or even effects that much … because adderall is mostly d-amphetamine anyways. Vyvanse is supposed to be the most consistent release throughout the day but it totally depends on your body converting it and the dosage so it’s not really a given."
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,"i had no experience with Adderall but can comment on Dexedrine vs. Vyvanse. I’m currently on Dexedrine but tried out Vyvanse for a bit in the past since it was suggested by my doctor when i was looking for something that wouldn’t wear out in 3-4 hours. I also take Venlafaxine XR for depression, and would take my first dose of Dexedrine/ Vyvanse with Venlafaxine in the morning.

Dexedrine has its pros and cons. So far it’s the only thing that significantly improved my productivity and make me stay truly focused the entire time - i feel like i could get 5x more work done when i took Dexedrine and it doesn’t give me too much anxiety. Cons: Dry mouth (could be improved by drinking water constantly), faster heart rate, decreased appetite (I recently started taking Dexedrine regularly again, and i can notice how my body doesn’t desire food as much) and since it’s fast-acting, i always have to retake my 2nd dose mid-day to stay productive during my 9-5. i tried Dexedrine Spansule (the long-acting form) before but it didn’t work as well and i was much less productive vs. when i’m on regular Dexedrine, so I decided to stick with the fast-acting one instead. last thing i don’t like about Dexedrine is how i’ll need to increase my dosage every 3-6 months, since once my body gets used to the current dosage that i’m on Dexedrine gets less effective and they had to increase my dosage to help me improve my productivity. I started out on 5mg a day and 2 years later i was at 40mg a day. at one point i also had trouble sleeping too, so i adjusted my afternoon intake to a lower dosage and was able to sleep better again.

Vyvanse was recommended to me by my doctor because I wanted something slow-acting since i didn’t wanna retake my medication throughout the day (he said it should typically lasts between 13-14 hrs) and I started out on a mid dose (30mg i believe). although it gave me terrible side effects: dizzy, dry mouth, diarrhea, and wasn’t as effective compared to Dexedrine (i was probably only half as focused as I could be), but it did stay on for longer. unfortunately the dizziness and diarrhea didn’t seem to go away after 2 weeks in. I also hate the fact that it didn’t make me as productive compared to Dexedrine so I asked to be switched back to Dexedrine and have been finding ways to work around to make my experience with Dexedrine more pleasant (drinking a lot of water, not taking a huge dose in the afternoon so i wouldn’t have trouble falling asleep, eating smaller meals but more frequently to make sure i’m still eating).

in the end both medication gave me a boost in productivity (Dexedrine was definitely a better choice for productivity however) but since my mind tends to wonder A LOT and work requires more focus time nowadays, I think Dexedrine was a better choice given my own needs even when it requires pretty frequent top up. also its side effects were more tolerable than Vyvanse’s. if possible, discuss with your doctor to see if you can try Dexedrine and compare your experience with Vyvanse/ Adderall and pick the one that works best for you. your medication should also suit your needs (my priority was productivity boost) and the side effects shouldn’t bother you all the time, and everyone reacts to meds differently so make sure you carefully discuss this with your doctor beforehand. hope this helps!"
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,"Vyvanse was a fucking nightmare and gave me vertigo-like spins. 

Dextroamph-amphetamine XR was a dream and actually stopped my daily migraines that no other treatment under the sun has been able to fix. 

Dextroamph-amphetamine ER, idk what's going on, but it feels almost like I have a headache; my brain lags behind my eyes, and it's almost like being super high visually, but still cognizant and able to make decisions; my eyes feel like they're moving faster than my brain, and I get almost a strain in the back left side of my skull, like when I have migraines. This is just with limited pain. 

I just want to function like a normal fucking person-- I'm sick of this shit; my doc told me people are getting drug tested and finding no amphetamines in their systems, which means they're giving us placebo pills, and/or fucking with the formulas."
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,Why not have the smaller dose 2x a day?
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,"Vyvanse didn't help me at all, just gave anxiety that I've never had before. Adderall XR was a small focus boost for 3 hours then a crash that was so unfocused it negated it."
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,I took 2 15mg ers in the morning. Adderall i get mean and vyvanse i have crazy aniexty. Insurance will only pay for 30mg ir of my dextro so we shall see
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,"Hi OP! I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and was prescribed with Vyvanse(starting with 10mg, now 20)I experienced some minor side effects as you mentioned, but yeah, nothing major. I am more calm after taking the pill, but no noticeable “motivation”. I do get things done as always, but before I was burning myself & relying on extreme anxiety, now less so.(still don’t wanna do my assignments lol)
I noticed the effect wearing of after like six hours or so, and my doctor suggested that I should try splitting the dose, take half of the dose after getting up and half 3 hrs later. In separate capsules of course haha. I haven’t try it yet but I think it might help! You can ask your doctor to prescribe 2x capsules in half the dose.
Also! Lay off the vitamine C, at least an hour before or later when you take Vyvanse, I read it somewhere that it can reduce the effects. 
Hope it helps :)"
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,">couldn’t sleep on vyvanse, lasted too lo

this is sooo helpful! my husband was prescribed adderall, which helped with focus but made him an asshole at the end of the day and was a shell of a human being. i suggested vyvanse, because i know so many people who love it, but his therapist suggested dex, which i had never heard of. he is going to try it tomorrow - i was nervous because i had no idea what it was, but this is good to hear you've had a good experience. what is your dosage and what does your bottle say? is it just called ""dextroamphetamine"" or does it have a popular ""brand"" name like vyvanse/prozac/zoloft/adderall etc"
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,when you say vyvanse was inconsistent do you mean how long it works? Because that’s been my experience.
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,Which manufacturer do you take?
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,Dexedrine Spansule is an XR. Dextroamphetamine
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,I'm late but what dosage did you take of Adderall and what dosage of Dexedrine do/did you take? I had heart palpitations from Adderall and was very sensitive to it.
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,That’s been my experience been prescribed 5mg 4x a day for the last few weeks and it’s been hands down the best thing so far.
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,"Adderall is a mixture of 4 different amphetamine salts 

25% Dextroamphetamine saccharate 
50% Dextroamphetamine sulfate
12.5%  Levoamphetamine sulfate
12.5% Levoamphetamine aspartate

Dexedrine, Zenzedi is 100% Dextroamphetamine Sulfate 

Hope this helps."
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,"Yup. The generic for Dexedrine is Dextroamphetamine Sulfate. 

Brand names are Dexedrine, Zenzedi, Dexatrostat. The generic name for adderall is Dextroamphetamine Amphetamine. So the pharmacy might be mistaken either say it’s for Dexedrine or Zenzedi. Be clear with them that it’s only Dextroamphetamine Sulfate. That’s pretty sad that a pharmacy doesn’t understand this. I’ve had no problem finding the 5mg tablet. If they don’t have 10mg it’s possible they have a different dosage. I’ve personally had good luck with Costco."
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,That’s what I’ve noticed with vyvanse. Almost all my anxiety goes away. I get less impatient and I’m more careful with my words. I get less frustrated when things don’t go my way. I feel like I process things with more logic other than my opinion’s definitely feel more confident in myself. I just wish it lasted as long as advertised. Seems inconsistent. Some days it work’s pretty long. Others it’s over in 4 hours.
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,Correct. But from what I can tell the L amphetamine in adderall does give me side effects. Even though it’s only 25% L
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,"I hope you are feeling better now, believe me when i say i 1 billion % know the struggle :/ Can you clarify if it was the extended release or instant release that gave you the bothersome side effects? ""XR"" and ""ER"" both sound like they could both mean extended release, and today is my monthly appt with the doctor and i want to talk to her about trying dextro bcuz the crap ive been trying for months is literal useless straight up GARBAGE, as in i guarentee you if i took a piss test there would be no amps in it, so i am wanting to try something else and am seeing alot of positive feedback about dextro."
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,Of vyvanse?  That’s what I thought but my NP was not very pleased with the idea as it’s a once a day pill.
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,You can always ask if they will accept a note from your provider on why you need more meds or use good rx for the extra they don’t cover.
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,Yeah I don’t take any vitamin c or citrus stuff until dinner. For me it’s like it comes back in little waves after 5 ish hours. I kinda notice it up to 12 ish hours but it’s sooo little that it might as well not be there.
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,"I take the generic version, so the bottle just says dextroamphetamine IR (instant release). The brand name was Dexedrine, but these days there's no brand name version of the instant release. You can only get brand name Dexedrine as an extended release capsule. I don't like extended release because it's not as consistent or predictable as instant release. 

A word of caution: the different generics vary wildly from one manufacturer to another. Avoid any drug made by KVK Tech; they are currently being sued by the FDA for numerous violations, and their Dex is absolute crap. The Dex made by Teva is good for most people, and I've heard that Sandoz is OK too."
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,"That, and how it made me feel. Some days it didn't seem to work at all, other days it sort of worked but caused bad side effects. It seemed to stop working as soon as I ate something. If I tried eating first and then taking it, it wouldn't work at all. It's like it would only work if my stomach was empty. I never knew how it was going to make me feel."
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,Teva and Sunrise Pharma both work well for me.
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,"I was on like 10-15mg adderall xr. 

Within about a week of switching to 5mg dexidrine once, sometimes twice a day on weekend, the tachycardia/palpitations was gone. I did also quit caffeine during that time, however."
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,Thank you so much! This is very helpful.
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,They want 400 for 20x2
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,163 days later…do you still feel this way about vyvanse?
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,"Vyvanse is typically 1 a day because typically it lasts 8-12 hours. :/ Your doc seems uncreative at best, but could be being outright dismissive of your stated experience.

That said, vyvanse is just super expensive dextroamphetamine (well, super expensive because they made it un-abusable (shouldn't that make it cheaper and easier to get?) and slower). There are tons of generics of that with are extended release, or the more typical booster of instant release."
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,I wish it was that easy. Last refill i had to wait 4 days without because they keep running out fast :/
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,Mallonik (the company behind the “M box”) is a good one to for both XR and IR and there’s one that starts with a Z that is probs the best of the generics right up there with OG brand name Dexedrine from the 70’s
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,"What dosage are you on? I think it starts at 5mg right? 
I use a Teva manufactured drug and like that formulation, so your advice makes sense."
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,How can you know what the manufacturer at your pharmacy is?
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,"There is actually brand-name dextroamphetamine IR, under the brand “Zenzedi” (confusingly). If you need a higher dosage than 10mg and your doc won’t simply prescribe more pills, or you don’t trust generics, or you just like paying more…it exists."
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,That’s odd. Because it actually becomes active in the liver. Lisdexamfetamine turns into Dextroamphetamine.  So stomach and digestion shouldn’t have much of an effect. But hey everyone’s different. Any other side effects on just Dex?  Thanks for all the info.
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,what is your dose? For me it is definitely more mind centered than anything in the body. I sorta miss the physical effect of motivation from Adderall but I sorta feel more controlled with Dextrostat.
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,yeah i use TEVA it def seems more calming but i need to get it increased but yeah i do notice i need to have my own motivation while using it physically.
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,No problem. Hope you can get it figured out. IMO. I much prefer Dexedrine over adderall. It’s very smooth. You don’t get that adrenaline physical feeling. It’s just the mental stimulation. The up and down is very smooth and the side effects are much more manageable. It also won’t raise your blood pressure or heart rate as much. Just a heads up the first few days will be a little more euphoric. But that goes away and you will just feel calm and level headed.
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,Use GoodRX if insurance doesn’t cover it.
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,"Been on Dexedrine for about 130 days because vyvanse didn’t last long. If we raised the dose on vyvanse it would give me some side effects and wouldn’t last any longer. It’s been good for me with what I take now. 5mg of dex 3-4 times a day. Side effects I get are mild. A little appetite suppression, mild increase in heart rate and blood pressure. Sometimes my feet will get a little cold but it’s nothing crazy. Sometimes I can be a little anxious when it first starts working but that goes away within an hour."
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,Yeah I totally agree. I’m trying to switch providers. The person I had before her seemed a lot more understanding. My possible solution is  split the dosage. 30mg of vyvanse in the morning 20mg 5 hours later. Or just add 5mg of Dexedrine. Or go to 10mg of Dexedrine XR and add 5’mg booster if needed. Unfortunately when the provider doesn’t even know what levo and dextro mean this can be very difficult to explain without looking stupid due to someone else’s lack of knowledge.
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,So if Vyvanse didn't work for you don't try dextroamphetamine?
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,I’ve had problems too. Every month it’s a part of my schedule to call 15 pharmacies near me
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,I use the Mallinkrodt version. It's been by far the best for me.
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,"I started at 5mg, but eventually worked my way up to 20mg twice a day (20 in the morning and 20 in the afternoon)."
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,"You have to ask. Sometimes they switch manufacturers too, so you have to ask every time you get a refill."
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,"Yeah it was weird. The only side effects I had on Dex were decreased appetite (that went away after a few weeks) and dry mouth, which was actually good because it encouraged me to drink more water."
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,I take 20mg in the morning and 20mg in the afternoon.
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,Thank you!  Will this work if I’m on medicaid blue cross blue shield?  Should I have my dr authorize it if not use good rx? right do I have to call first. To make sure  I’m willing to spend 200 for them
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,Vyvanse for me is pretty affordable. $1.30 per pill.
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,"I wouldn't say discount it completely, but probably put it low on the list to try. 

The brand name did add something to the dextroamphetamine (the ""lis"" prefix) to make it get absorbed in the gut instead of the stomach, so it is possible ""didn't work"" could be something like your body chemistry. It also makes it slower, so if ""didn't work"" means it kept you up at night, then the regular version could be worth trying.

If you had a bad reaction though, something other than dose too low or too high, yeah, low odds dextroamphetamine is the med for you. 

On the other hand, if you like OJ in the morning, lisdextroamphetamine (Vyvanse) is absorbed in the gut, so it would be okay with that but with normal amphetamines what I read is that too much citric acid makes them not work as well."
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,Every time (do you mean adderall). Like no. It’s just Dextroamphetamine. Smh
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,Ugh so annoying…
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,That’s good. Yeah those are the side effects I get on vyvanse. Dry mouth and decreased appetite. Felt a little nauseous this morning when it first kicked in but that was only for 5 minutes.
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,Lucky.  I gotta start all over again bc my Dr got fed up with me switching stims and manufacturers which I don't get wtf.  He didn't get some of them don't work like they used to.
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,Yep!
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,Yeah she added a 5mg dex booster and the dex lasts almost as long as the vyvanse and feels much smoother.
Please share any experience regarding Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine) vs Adderall (amphetamine salts) vs Vyvanse 🤔,I hate when they think every medicine is the same or have no clue how ir or er work🙄
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"As someone who was diagnosed as a child, I used to have my friends tell me ""don't take your meds tomorrow, we want you to be fun"". Which means I'm not ""fun"" on my meds, and I'm not in some ways. I'm not acting impulsively, I'm not crazy irresponsible, etc. But for young people, that's fun. They don't realize that you have to do things that are boring but necessary. She wants her old daddy because he was probably fun, wild, and potentially not as responsible. That may have put a lot of responsibility on your wife. 

Do yourself a favor and realize that this is a standard 4 yr old's response to something they don't 100% like (I say this as a preschool teacher with a lot of young child experience). Please don't take her words to heart. She will be grateful later when she learns that you did what you needed to do to better yourself. Right now, she's just reacting to change. Make sure you try to play games with her. Make believe is something you CAN learn to tap into; many adults ""relearn"" how to use their imagination when they have kids. It was easier for you before, but remember you are still getting used to your meds yourself, you body will find homeostasis in a little while, making it easier to find balance. Good luck, and congrats on finding meds that help you."

4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,You could have shaved your beard and gotten the same response.
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"I'm sorry, this is really hard. Please keep in mind she's 4 and will accept this change with some time. You can do your best to be playful and spontaneous with her and it'll get easier, for both of you."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,Ya gotta remember that kids are emotional beings. Just because she voiced what was in her head at that exact moment does not mean that she feels that way at any other time. Kids will say a lot of mean hurtful things throughout their growth. Just remember to do your best and don't beat yourself up too bad. None of us actually know what we're doing. Parenting is 100% faking it till ya make it lol.
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Hey I know you've already got a lot of comments but I thought I would add in my experience since I have a dad who my mother and I suspect have ASHD. He has always been scared of treatment. he was really fun when I was a kid and was my favourite parent but he has a lot of regrets over very dangerous situations we ended up in because of his inattention. Things like my sister being hospitalised due to him not supervising her well in the same playground. Me being hospitalised because he fell asleep and I ate paracetamol. Him putting me down in a carrier in front of a parked car while he went into the shops,  had to run out when it started driving. There's lots of stories of life threatening situations like that. So while he was fun it came with a cost. 

Also when I got older his inability to listen to me or be there for me emotionally did create distance between us. I no longer wanted the fun parent, I wanted the emotionally caring and socially aware parent. I now can accept my dad for his fun and flaws as an adult but it took a long time to get there and it would have been easier on our family if he was open to treatment"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Dad on Vyvanse with 3 year old daughter and 7 year old son here. Different situations, people, yadda yadda, but I hear you. Hearing that would hurt me, too. My intuitive answer to your question is to keep on keeping on and weather out the phase…for both of you. You’re still finding your new normal on meds and she’s adjusting to changes from her perspective. She doesn’t have the words to kindly and accurately communicate her feelings…and her feelings are new and raw. Take what she says with a huge grain of salt. My girl sometimes says she likes mommy more but I know that’s because mommy just got home from work and she likes mommy more *right now*. Your daughter loves and likes you, dad. Just put in your emotional armor for a few days or weeks and ride it out. Keep on playing, keep on loving, keep on reading and being there. 

Also, you are still your authentic self on meds. You have made a choice for you and those around you. I’m excited for you. Good luck!"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Do not stop taking helpful medication on the advice of a 4-year-old. She doesn’t even know what she’s saying, she’s just saying whatever comes to mind that might help her get her way. Kids like irresponsible adults because kids are irresponsible. When she gets older, she’ll appreciate having responsible parent as a role model. You just described all the great things that are happening in your life. Don’t give that up just to make her happy. It’s good that you love your daughter and you want to make her happy, but this isn’t the way. She will say things like this for attention or to get her way whether you’re taking your medication or not. Do what’s best for you. What’s best for you, in this case, is also what’s best for her."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"It’s your job to be her father, not her friend. It’s great when you can be both, but one takes priority, and she’s not always going to like it. And 4 year olds are sometimes just smart enough and selfish enough to say the most hurtful things when they don’t get what they want. 

Chances are the dex makes you a much better father and only somewhat worse friend. You’ll adjust and your daughter will adjust, even if it feels like she lost her best friend. Talk to her about what’s going on, and also about saying hurtful things. In any case your partner is probably thrilled to have a new co-parent. 

I highly recommend taking days off or with a lower dose whenever you can just to keep your tolerance in check. For you and your family, maybe one day a weekend. But this is tricky because that day will often be lower energy, not great for dealing with kids. Expect this to take weeks. It’ll be a process right along with process of raising kiddos, and you and your family’s needs will continue to evolve."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,[removed]
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"No, you should focus on you. This may sound harsh (but I have kids as well) but you have other responsibilities to yourself and your daughter that go well beyond catering to her 4yo needs for a family clown or a friend.

She will grow older and she will mature and even if it is difficult now, the change you notice in yourself is a change she needs to get accustomed to as well. 

Ultimately, I am sure that will not remember the time she was four but she will remember the much better dad and the much better lessons she learned from a father who was not riddled with anxiety (because she *will* pick up on that too, and those are lessons you won't even realize you are giving her until its too late).

Your concern is commendable and shows how much you love her but imo, she needs to become a happy a balanced teen/young adult/adult... not just a happy 4yo."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"As someone who has an ADHD dad, yes, he was the tits when I was a kid, he was so fun and goofy. But you know what 4 year old me didn’t notice then that was really hurtful to my development growing up?

Being late to school every day, being late to all of our family functions, never having help with my homework, never having a proper bedtime, all of my doctors appointments that were missed because they were forgotten about, etc. I could go on.

My dad is still the tits, and I’ve never experienced him medicated for adhd because he was told he grew out of it. (I got a late diagnosis and it all sort of clicked last year.) but, I will always wonder what my life would have been like if he were medicated.

Also, I was never shown how to put myself first by either of my parents and I am *still* learning/unlearning hurtful behaviors that came from that and I’m almost in my 30’s.

Your daughter doesn’t understand right now, you are still *you* even medicated, nothing can change who you are. 

You are setting a good example for your daughter by taking care of yourself and she will appreciate it down the road."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Okay, I'm not an expert on anything, but are you *sure* this is because of your meds? Like has she identified anything that you think comes from your meds at being the reason? Because I know some kids go through phases where they just like saying ""no"", or saying they wish they had different parents, want their other parent, etc."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Find new ways to connect with her. Perhaps you are more capable now of remembering to get a little treat or surprise, or more sustained attention when you're playing one on one. As she gets older ( and it's so fast isn't it?), The way she wants to interact with you will.change too. She is so little now and the toddler mind being like the ADHD one, but pretty soon that will change and she will need and want different things from you. Can't take their emotions and words too personally. She is lucky to have a good father who cares about connecting with her and is willing to try new stuff to do so. You can also be a good dad just sitting there and letting her run the show, going along with her imagination and roleplay."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Little kids can be jerks.  Kids do so this kind of stuff even to parents who aren’t doing anything different.  My son went through a few phase where he wouldn’t let anyone but me do anything for him and would tell his dad to “go away, I only want mom.”  I’d keep on your meds, your daughter needs a healthy, functional parent more than a silly playmate. Be sure to make time for her and try not to let what she says get to you. Also let her know she hurt your feelings and ask why she feels that way. She will adjust and you can still have fun with her. You may also still be adjusting to your meds, when you first start the change is very profound and some people become all business for a while, as you get used to the new you and adjust to the meds it will become the new normal and you’ll relax and be able to be silly and fun while still being able to get things done."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"You've gotten a lot of really good responses.  But I want to add, think about what she will think when she's 30. If you aren't taking care of yourself, 30 year old her will have a lit of messy feelings about you, with that grown up adult perspective.  About how you were chaotic, unorganized, had poor functioning, emotional dysregulaton, etc.  30 year old her would likely prefer to see you successful."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Be a responsible adult and do whats for the greater good, emotions dont always tell truths, since she is a child, she might not like uncommon things, she will have to be her own person eventually anyway, do what you think is right, not what feels easy, thats the ADHD trapp again..."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,Dexedrine has a half life close to 12 hours. Methylphenidate has one of around 3.5 hours if you don’t get the extended release versions. I prefer methylphenidate because I can take it in the morning (and maybe again later if I need it) and then by the afternoon it wears off and I can be goofy again. I get better sleep that way as well.
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Dude you are already more connected with her by virtue of this comment. 

Pre meds I had trouble settling down to play or even read at bedtime with my 4yo. My brain shuts up enough to let me do pretend play or have patience with him.
 Trust me... stay on the meds.


Do not take med holidays ever. You will mess up yourself and your relationships. You'll be worse off yo yo-ing your brain and emotions. It's a bit like saying ""I'll only Binge drink when I want to be fun"". The hangover is not worth it."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,Can you have a conversation with your daughter about why Daddy takes his medicine? It might help her to understand. Kids can be very accepting and empathetic when you take the time to explain things to them. It also shows you love and respect her. She may even start reminding you to take it 😂
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"The meds tend to take a little time to get used to, I also find Dexedrine quite easy to get stuck in thought loops with, especially negative spiralling especially after a comment on that nature on a personal level. I noticed starting people would point out certain things and I would have no idea and then begin to hyper focus on the thoughts of what did I do wrong even if it was something like my mood was different (happens to the best of us). I think it’s a lot of trial and error with meds and finding the perfect dosage but you sound like your recognizing the issue and caring to the point of asking others opinion, I mean that alone shows your awareness of something not being quite right and the motivation to change either meds or dosage but of course consulting with your doctor and having follow ups if possible. I find Dexedrine (for me) can bring out some emotional changes (agitation, lethargy, sometimes flat effect) and if my sleep or daily schedule is off then most people close to me will begin to point out if something seems off, then I know to take a break for a a day or take a little less the next day. Very easy to get stuck on tasks with it so I find a list or setting timers helps quite a bit. Sometimes it’s hard to do that and you gotta cut yourself some slack, it’s progress towards your mental health which is always very very important. Took a while for me to figure out timing and how it would effect the rest of my day. But you know different smokes for different folks.
Sorry it’s been rough, I couldnt imagine how it feels so I won’t pretend I do, but I hope things start looking up!
All the best!"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Shes's 4 you're the adult. She will get used to it, just need to try in different ways. But going of your meds puts all the strain on your marriage."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Don’t take it too personally, 4 year olds say all sorts of silly things for silly reasons. I said my fair share of stupid stuff at that age."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"If you don't need to take the meds every day, take them only when you have to work. And explain it to your kid. Explain what ADHD is, say that your regular adhd brain is a bit similar to hers. Always want to play and explore stuff. And it's okay to some point in life, when you are still a kid, but as you grow up you are supposed to get a bit more organised and serious. And your brain just can't switch to the ""adult mode"" itself, so you have meds to do it for you. So you can be a succesfull adult, and be able to take care of the house, be able to work (so there is money for food and toys and other stuff). If you don't take your meds your brain switches back to the exploring and playful mode. Explain it to her and say that you won't take your meds on your days off, and she will have her dad on playful-mode when dad doesn't need to do any important adult stuff that needs him focused and more serious. 


If you like explaining things visually (which is ofc good with most kids), I would imagine this as a brain that has a lightswitch that has 3 positions. Up, middle, and down. Up is colorful flashing bright lights and a discoball. Middle is a regular warm white light. Down is complete darkness. Colorful flashing lights and discoballs are cool if you want to have fun and play and dance, but it's hard to focus with them on when you are trying to learn, work or do something important that requires focus. Regular white light is a default setting for most people. It's comfortable to work, talk with people, learn things and focus. Darkness can be a bit scary, you barely see anything and you can mistake something not scary for a danger. 

Most peoples brains are just white warm light by default. Some people, like you, have it set on disco lights, that make it uncomfortable to work with etc. So you have to take meds that will switch your mind to a calm warm white. But that's not a party mood anymore. And there are people whose minds are darkness and they struggle to put a light on. So they take meds to have the white light and life comfortably."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"I went through the same thing with my daughter. She was around the same age when I started medication and it was incredibly hard on me when she didn't like being around me. It took a long time but she adjusted to the medicated version of me and eventually we grew even closer. She's the oldest of my 4 kids and we have the closest relationship. She's also 14 now and starting to take medication herself so I get to share my experiences on what to expect.
I hope things can turn around for you quickly. I know that doing what's best for you and your family can be incredibly difficult and I hope you stick with it. Good luck!"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"I wouldn't read too much into it.  Kids say things without thinking about it and they have a favorite parent that varies with whatever mood they happen to be in.  As they get older, as teenagers they will go out of their way to say hurtful things that they don't mean (even if they don't know they don't mean it) and I would say be equally ready to let that go too."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Children words CAN reflect very deep truths. But most of the time they say stupid shit. You are the adult, you suffer from this. On the long run your daughter will benefit more from a dad who has his shit together thant om a dad who has a talent for coming up with silly games;she won't be 4 yo for ever. If you are able to fill out your role as pater familias better with the medication, ignore her stupid opinion. If you think the medication prevents you in that function , consider her opinion."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,No don't cut the dex out. Quitting meds for a developmental disorder just because your toddler doesn't understand what's going on is incredibly self destructive and foolish.
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"She'll adapt. There's a chance she could have done that even without the meds, kids get weird shot into their heads sometimes. Please don't stop the meds since you are getting SO many benefits from them.

If anything, book yourself a couple sessions with a counselor / CBT. It's SUPER important that you don't start fawning every time your daughter says something like this, otherwise it will become her preferred method of obtaining things from you. (Not on purpose, it's just normal for humans to do what works.) As much as it hurts, just don't react and she will eventually move on from it.

At that age, using language is like poking things with a stick to see what happens. If something happens every time she pokes you, she will keep doing it. It's natural learning. Being aware of it will help you avoid feeding the cycle :)"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"While you've been on meds for just 2 months and it feels like a new thing so changes should be attribute to the meds. For your daughter 2 months is a significant portion of her life. So could be that it's a new phase she's gotten into.

Is it possible to take breaks on the weekends and maybe play more then? Or maybe you can try another of the stimulants. Not fun to start the whole process again. But they could work better. Or just wait, in a year or two she's probably have different priorities for what she would like from you."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,Woah. Wait up. This has nothing to do with the medication. Our four year old yells at my wife and says he hates her. It’s the age. Google “4 year-old hates daddy”.
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Don't cut out the meds. You can't be your best for her if you're not being your best for *you* first! Meds take time to adjust to. You can and will learn how to slide back into playtime mode, but you *have* to be fully in control of your own brain first."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Kids go through all sorts of phases.  Sometimes daddy is the favorite, sometimes mommy is.  You shouldn't take something like this personally.

It's very likely your daughter's mean statement has nothing to do with you or your medicine.  If anything your medicine is just making you more sensitive so you are taking it harder."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Your kid might also be reaction to you *spending more time* away from her being productive rather than having all the time in the world for her (because without dex I’m betting timeblindness and procrastination helped you spend more time with your kid instead of going to go to XYZ task). It also might be a physical thing - are you more upright/less on the ground and at her level on stimulants? I know I am with kids - I get physically stiffer.  

Some people do take “off” days where they don’t take their stimulants (STILL TAKE THE ZOLOFT!) to have a loosey goosey Saturday in their pjs watching cartoons and doing art. It’s not for everyone - my emotional regulation requires Ritalin every day, off days suck - but you might think about that. 

Also sometimes kids go through mommy or daddy phases."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Sounds like maybe you and your wife should have an open and honest conversation with your daughter. She doesn't understand this cause and effect thing yet. Her brain is literally not developed enough to understand any of that.     

 Their world is *so small* at that age, that they can't help but be self-centered. Everything in their world revolves around *them*. What she does understand is that her daddy loves her, but daddy seems a little different and less silly now. It doesn't occur to her that this is due to something completely unrelated to her and she may incorrectly believe your behavior has changed bc of something she did. Kids are smart, but utterly ignorant.     

That's kids, man. They have no idea what is happening outside their own little personal sphere. (I don't think I even knew my mom had a name besides ""Mom"" until I was like 6 lol.) She doesn't understand responsibility. She only understands her relationship to you. Talk to her, and ask lots of questions. Find out what exactly is making her feel the way she is feeling. Try to explain your change in words she can understand. Maybe using things like naps and crankiness or bath time, or whatever she doesn't like at the time. Sometimes we have to do things to make ourselves better, and that takes some hard work. Sometimes that can change people, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Daddy is working as hard as he can to be the best daddy he can, and that's not always hide and seek and surprise fun. Daddy wants to be able to give his favor girl surprise fun *forever*, not just as a little girl!"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"You're not doing anything wrong and you need those meds to function and take care of your children. Your child is too young and too immature to understand that. I would also be hurt if I heard that but you need to realize that the words of a 4 years old aren't always full of wisdom and worthy of consideration. At the end of the day you're the father and you know better, what could a 4 years old know about the responsability keeping a job and functionning in society entails .

&#x200B;

However your child is not 100% wrong. I myself sometimes feel like a robot or a zombie when I'm on Adderall. Meds will always have drawbacks. It all comes down to : Can you function without the meds or do you absolutely need them. You need to think hard about it. Like to legit sit down and ponder on it for a long time.

&#x200B;

I personally don't think that just because the meds make you ''more serious''  or a bit more ''numb'' you're an asshole and a bad person and a bad parent and anybody who thinks so isn't very rational. However the devil is in the details so you should know better. Hence why you need to think about it.

&#x200B;

But I do dislike the anxiety of being on Aderall and how it kills my creativity and spontaneity."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Great parenting advice on this thread. I just wanted to add in that your creativity and silliness will come back to a great extent if you make time and effort for it. Your brain is getting used to new things and habits. Right now it’s playing “catch up” but in a bit it will adjust and adapt giving you additional space to create. 

You’re also forming new habits and right now those take priority but if you also prioritize play it will come back as well. Yes it will feel different at first, but in my experience it’s because you’re more mindful and intentional with it. That’s not a bad thing, in fact it will probably yield a more enjoyable experience for both of you, but you need to practice a little and get used to using your new tools vs impulse. 

Enjoy rediscovering something happy and playful while you’re attaining mental stability! :)"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"I've been prescribed Dexedrine daily for more than 15 years now (...wow), with a few years-long gaps here and there. I don't have children but I can at least tell you this — you will slowly return to a 'more normal' version of yourself. Your brain and body will become accustomed to the effects (this is why many people increase their doses over time, as the same dose feels like it does less after long enough), and you will notice the suppressed parts of your personality come back, although they will still be regulated more than before (which is a good thing).

From someone who has taken breaks using the same meds as you, and has had periods of time where my pill discipline was sloppy—you will definitely feel the same personality 'dampening' if you ever take breaks and start back up again. It gets worse and worse the more you mess with that... IE if you miss a day or two in a row, no big deal, but if you miss a few days in a row several times over the course of a week or two, the extremes between impulsivity and dullness will become more and more pronounced. The days you skip it you will feel like you need to sleep all day and eat everything, and the days you take it you WILL feel like a neurotic asshole. Neither of these are good for you or your family.

Slow, steady, and consistently — that's the key. Give it time. Your daughter will still love you, I promise."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"I say this as someone who carries (& is working on)  a hefty amount of mummy-guilt: this is an 'attend to your own mask first 'scenario. 

I have spent a long time (because of a lot of background I wont go into) trying to fix everything for my kids. Not in a material spoiled way; but in terms of trying to make situations turn out OK, happy, better, anything but sad. 

But as they grow older, it becomes harder, because there are things you can't easily fix or redirect them with. And they're fine. 

There will always be (hopefully few) things you can't fix for them. With these I tell them (if it's something they're able to understand) that I'm sorry I can't make it better, but that I can be with them & support them while they experience it. 

As someone who just started ADHD meds successfully, I know how life-changing it feels. I know the peace they bring. If your life is better with them, that is the more important need in this scenario. Your daughter still has a loving, healthy father & she will adapt (& frankly forget). She may wish for a 4_year-old-level of fun a the moment, but this is a small percentage of her life - for the majority of it, a happy, healthy father is going to be much more important.

(And I'm sorry - it must be pretty heartbreaking at the moment. We pour our hearts into them & they can cut them right out with just a few words! But perspective is weird when you're four. My friend's little girl would never let dad put her to bed because mum was best. Well mum has been ill recently, dad took over bedtime, & now dad is the bedtime king! They have a very dodgy idea of permanence at that age - whatever is most recent can become an over-arching generalisation in their eyes.)"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"She doesn’t mean it. It’s your adhd brain being overly emotional.

Also I take medication that cuts out around 6pm, just so I get a few hours of non-medicated me play time with the kids. Could be an alternative at times"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"As a mother, I can confidently tell you that kids are just dicks. Okay not dicks, but have you seen those videos of dads shaving their beards off, and when the kids see their bare-faced dad, they freak the fuck out?

The new/unfamiliar is hard for them, and they don't know how to articulate that. The way you move through the world is new, and your daughter notices and is wrapping her head around it.

You're only two months in. Your improved functioning is going to have amazing returns on your life and relationships. The new normal will settle, and your relationship will most likely return to normal.

In the event you're continuing to struggle with being present/connected, talk to your psych at the next appointment. There are alternatives to just going off your meds. There are different meds. You could also change doseage. 

As a mental health professional, I do not prescribe meds, but I'm expected to have a basic understanding of them for my families. Sometimes, we have families whose kiddo doesn't like the way they feel on their meds, but they don't want to go back to being constantly dysregulated and/or off-task. I always recommend they talk to their doc and see what med management can be done to reconcile those two things."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,Bro 4 year olds will say that if you do something like turn off the tv while their show is on it’s just a kid thing pretty much every parent hears it at some point
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Im 36, i have a 10 month old child, have adhd and am on lisdexemphetamine (vysanse) and simply have this to say:

If meds give you the ability to be the best version of yourself, that is best for your family, even if they dont understand it (yet). 

I find my meds give me more energy and motivation to do the things i need to do for my family. I am also more spontaneous and silly when not on meds but thats only because my brain is searching for missing dopamine.

Follow your psychiatrist's advice and stick to whats best for you as that, ultimately, will be whats best for your daughter. One day, she will understand that too."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Try talking to your doctor about getting more pills in smaller doses.

I was getting really bad dry mouth with dex until they put mine in extended release capsules. Maybe having 2 smaller doses throughout the first 2/3rds of the day would have it ware off in time for family time after work"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"I would question the Zoloft. That stuff was awful. It gave me this weird god complex where I thought I was right no matter what. I would yell at random people if I felt slighted in the least. I never yelled at my children or wife but I would yell at everyone else. 

ADHD and Zoloft is a very bad combination in my book. The fact that so many with ADHD wear their emotions on their sleeve already, I think is only amplified for worse with Zoloft."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"I know she’s your kid but that’s the thing, she’s literally just a 4 year old kid, what do 4 year olds know about anything????

Chin up, big guy! :-)"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"1) post this in r/toddlers believe me those people have some great tips for negotiating with little terrorists that don’t yet have critical thinking skills 
2) Daddy’s health and well-being come first in order for Daddy to be healthy and the best Daddy he can. Little one benefits from a healthy daddy. 
3) Take it with a grain of salt, she’s a toddler. I don’t want to minimize your feelings, but your advisary here isn’t playing with a full deck of cards yet.  She’s 4. 
4) I just came back from family visits Christmas, and I can tell you that my family also doesn’t like me “on meds” as much - I’m less fun, more anxious, more assertive, (I think) much better at socializing and also setting boundaries.  I don’t drink as much as I used too - maybe this makes me boring at Christmas.  BUT -  my relationship with my husband is way better because of the meds. I can’t even begin to describe how much better of a life and household partner I am than I was 10 years ago. No comparison.  Do your meds help you be a better husband and father? Not the fun one, but the actual take care of hard adulting things? If yes, I’d say focus on being a good partner to your spouse and the two of you can support each other while your daughter ping pongs between which parent is her favourite on any given week.  
Hang in there!"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"You can try, (and I would not recommend doing this without a doctor approval first) going a day or two maybe three without them and just seeing if that helps. Try timing it so you are in sync with your weekends."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"This sounds so much like my current situation and I'm not sure the best advice. I used to be the overly fun parent before I was medicated. It was easy to be silly and make up games with my kid, but I struggled with other aspects of life (nothing too bad, I wasn't gonna get fired or go hungry or anything). I got my meds and felt amazing! Everything that appeared to be easy for other people was getting easier for me too, but I was less fun and less spontaneous.

Flash forward a few years and there's 2 more kids. They're young and bouncy and remind me of how I used to be. They don't have problems with school so no worries there. My chief concern is: will being a more serious parent mean they won't ""like"" me later in life and won't want me to be around except for holidays? And I dont mean ""like"" here as being best friends with my kids but I don't want them to avoid the hard ass with no imagination.

I think too many people are ""waving off"" the thoughts of your daughter just cause she's 4. Her feelings are very valid and it's probably an observation others have made but haven't mentioned to you directly."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine," Very interesting and much appreciated post, I have had the same results with my creativity, humour, and spontaneity. Glad I’m not alone! As a dad to a former 4 yr old, I wouldn’t sweat it, kids change all the time. All you have to do is give it time and come up with fun father daughter activities that she will remember forever. That funny guy is still in there somewhere."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,Im only on meds since november but eventually my silly personality came back a few weeks ago. After the meds are not new to my body. When i just got them im only focused on what im supposed to do. Now they’re just a part of me
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Just a note - I was on Adderall for a long time then changed to Dex for two months - and while it was great productivity it made me numb. Like I wasn’t my self. I just became well - just existing - yet everything else was great with it dealing with my ADHD. I ended up back on Adderall and felt my self again in two weeks and kept up the productiveness but it was actually my daughter mentioning to me about one month thing that I was different and not in the best way (less empathetic yet emotional on things I should be and not emotional where I should have been) that made me really notice it 

I know Aus doesn’t do Adderall but speak to your doc about this if you personally are bothered by it about trying other stuff out. Remember Dex is an antidepressant too. 

If not there are great suggestions in the comments in this thread that I would look into 

Best of luck!!"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"At the end of the day, there's more to being a father than being a great entertainer. You're going to be more reliable, more emotionally regulated and in the long run, more present.

Dex did change my personality so now I'm on a combo of Concerta and a ritalin top up (the problem with methylphenidate usage in adults I think is that they start you too high and on the short acting stuff which is why most adults think they don't tolerate it, but the slow release is gentle with a top up). But either way, you're going to change, and it's likely you'll be able to connect with your daughter in the long run more now that your ADHD is managed."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"I wouldn't place too much weight on what a 4y/o has said in reaction to change- when my dad shaved his beard off for the first time when I was 4, I wouldn't speak to him until it grew back. You're not a rational human at that age, she still loves you, and as the many other points have been said, you're doing this to be better for your family. She will adjust :)"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Well the first question is how do you feel on meds? Based on what you said, it seems like they’re working well. I know when I was younger on Ritalin it kind of suppressed most of my emotions. I didn’t feel like myself. But if the only negative effect is being less spontaneous and silly and you’re otherwise happy, well….that’s part of ADHD. 

Kids don’t understand. They don’t get that the things that make dad silly and “fun” also make him struggle at work and with his responsibilities. Ask some friends or your SO how they feel."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Dear Op,

Jesus fucking Christ, she is a child.

You know better."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"DO NOT cut the dex!!! It is making your life better. Your daughter is used to a daddy who is like another child - silly, forgetful, irresponsible, carefree. This is NOT what your daughter needs!! She needs a daddy that is strong, responsible and happy with himself. Able to provide for her in a way that she needs. 

She's 4. She doesn't know what she's saying. She doesn't know what's going on. She could no possibly understand the situation and she doesn't have to. I'm sorry you are going through this but you need to take care of YOU so that you can take care of her. 

Also, not sure if you've ""settled in"" to your prescription or not but you should be taking a day or two off the meds every week. So if you work weekdays, maybe the weekends can be a ""break"" from your meds (obviously discuss with your Dr first) and have some freeform fun days with your daughter. 

Best of luck! And I'm so happy for you that you've finally been able to find yourself with meds. As an adult diagnosed in my early thirties, it was absolutely life changing."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,Don't stop taking ur meds cuz ur kid wants u too. She's 4. Ur clearly function better on them. Find other ways to connect with her.
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"I just wanted to say an enormous thanks to all those who’ve responded to this thread. I’ve posted quite a few things in the past on here - but never in a million years did I expect so many likes and comments. Really shows how compassionate folks can be when they see someone struggling with something.

Over the last few days I’ve continued with the Dex but focused really hard on the relationship with my daughter. While we’ve not perhaps had quite the level of silly fun we’ve been able to in the past, I’ve also been able to give her experiences that my lack of mental energy and focus, and general disorganisation, would never have usually allowed. I’ve also been able to unearth a little more silliness in myself, so all in all I think I’ll continue for now.

A couple of other thoughts. I’ve found that keeping my caffeine intake up a bit helps to retain my sociability, whereas cutting it out intensifies the “seriousness” side effect that comes with Dex. Secondly, I have a great relationship with my doc, and am considering trying a methylphenidate based med for a little while, just to see if I have any luck. I tend to hear less positive things for this class of drugs on forums, but the studies suggest they’re equally as effective, so I will give them a go.

On a final note, while I agree that she’s 4 and everything should be taken with a massive grain of salt, one of the reasons it hurt so badly is that I could already feel that I was different to my prior self, but I’d prioritised my symptom relief over that niggling feeling. That led to a tremendous sense of guilt, even if is still the right thing to do. I also will always listen to what my girls tell me. While she’s only 4, there can still be truth or things to learn from what she shares, and nothing is more important than words from either of my daughters or my wife.

Anyway, thanks so much everyone. I can’t reply to everything as I’ll probably get RSI, but you’re great folks for chipping in."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,Do what's right for you. Kids are stupid.
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,Family therapy comes to mind. A second adult who is unbiased may help you work out a game plan to help you rebond.
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,I took Des for years for ADD. I finally had to stop because it made me so intense and angry. It’s a terrible drug to detox from…
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,Have you tried lower doses? I was a machine at work at a higher dose but kind of a robot. I feel better on a lower dose because it helps control symptoms but I still have silliness and a sense of humor.
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,Talk to your Doctor. I never felt like myself on Dexadrine. I felt like a robot. I've gone on and off it since the 90s. Mostly because the productivity wasn't worth the tramping down of my personality. The robot didn't have many friends. Finally it occurred to me In 2019! It only took me 20 some years for me to think to ask my Doctor about trying other meds. Once we got the dosage right things have been pretty good. I get to be a slightly more serious version of myself and not the robot.
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,Your life is about your daughter right now. ❤️
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"I was diagnosed as a child and was always told I was different and seemed low. I hate that people on this sub think meds are the solution to everything when they absolutely are not. You're taking a ""medical"" form of speed . You can get the same thing from coffee without the side effects."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"You are her parent, her guardian. It is not you job to be a silly friend and play fun games with her. It is your job to provide and raise her. 

If you get more done and you keep yourself healthier, that is also good for her, because she will have more of you later. 

You will connect with her again, all of you have to adjust to you on meds, it may feel like you are not you anymore, but you are, just a different version."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"My daughter is different during the week on her meds, but silly on the weekends without them. She was told to not take them on the weekends, holidays, or during vacations because she was getting intense headaches and shakiness if she missed a dose (think 31 day months with 30 days of meds, or prescription running out before doc visit; she doesn't get the symptoms anymore) Do you have the option of not taking the meds on weekends? I don't know if it would help, or if it's even something you'd want to do, so ignore if not!"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Great you are getting help with this condition!  I've had similar challenges.

You might try guided ""loving kindness"" meditation.  Easy to find online.  Like 10 minutes.  Not much of a down side to that.

I do it from time to time and feel like it keeps me grounded emotionally."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"When I was about 4 i told my grandpa I liked it better when he's drinking beer because he's nicer and more fun than when he isn't drinking beer. (He was a very nice and fun man, he was just more loose and relaxed and could put up with my endless chattering more) he had an existential crisis that day. 

I also made an off hand comment when I was 16 about him spending all day every day watching movies; not a bad thing and I didn't mean it as a bad comment, just a passing remark. He had another existential crisis. 

That poor man, I loved him with all of my heart and was just saying stupid kid stuff, but boy did it effect him. She is going to say stuff that will shatter your world sometimes, you just need to do something to take your mind off the comment completely, then after words discuss with your wife how to change whatever issue your daughter has. 

Info; What does your wife think about your daughters comment? 

Also, not that taking your meds is bad or makes you less fun at all, but can you take the weekend off your meds once in a while? Or promise her that you still love doing fun silly stuff, but you have responsibilities, to make your house and family happy; so one day a week is dedicated silly time, and the rest we try to keep the house together? 

Hope this helps!"

4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Ah my heart really went out to you! You come across as an amazing Dad and I imagine this must be hurtful to experience. I echo another comment where you could make time and have a little chat with her. Kids are so perceptive and she probably notices a difference in you that might be a bit strange for her to adjust to. I'm sure you will find an appropriate way to explain that you are still the same loving Dad, but your medicine helps you do some of the boring grown up stuff so you are able to have more fun. 
If she understands what is going on and feels part of the process of helping Daddy, I'm sure it will be a lot easier and everyone will adjust. 
If anything it is a good reminder of the importance of not taking our children for granted and making time to be goofy 🤪
I don't have children but have had to try and balance benefits of meds (I'm also taking dexamphetamine and Vyvanse) with keeping irritation and anxiety in check. 
My partner sometimes remarks that I seem much better in myself on meds, but forgets this when I snap his head off when the irritation catches up on me. 
These meds aren't perfect but it helps if those around us are able to support us and cut us some slack. Your daughter sounds like she loves her Daddy very much and I'm sure she will be delighted to help you tap into your imagination and get back into thinking like a kid ☺️"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,Have you tried other medications? To see if any of them help with other symptoms while still keeping your creativity?
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Besides the main thing i want to reiterate that everyone else haa been enphasizing that you on meds isnt bad especially if your well being improved.. and ur daughter will surely adjust, i wanted to give insight on something i do!

I have 5mg instant release available for me to take if i happen to need it after my 15mg extended release. I dont take it every day because my responsibilities vary each day as well as my reaction to my meds, so sometimes i end up saving a few extras.
On days where I want that goofy, hyper, albeit somewhat fatigued self, and want to take a break from the side effects, i do not take my extended release. I have these IR tablets available if I get too out of it, or get any particular withdrawal symptom. So on these days sometimes I will take 2 5mg IRs , or 1. They help me so much when i want a med break.
For me, I tend to be ultra sensetive to side effects of my meds so these breaks have many purposes. If you do not feel that the break is right for you, I have some assurance for you.
Youre most likely adjusting to the meds. At first when I started to take my new ones I felt kind of different socially and mentally in that I had less to say, almost feeling robotic and a little on edge. Now as I adjust I feel more like my normal self, its just that the meds pick me up and guide me when I need to get things done. You can always adjust your meds to find a sweet spot between productivity and minimal change/side effect too.
Second of all, you are an amazing parent! She is very young and, like others said, probably wont remember what she said very soon. She definitely loves you no matter what and I know you will be able to find other ways that you guys can bond on the meds as well, the meds really open your mind to new ideas since they help you think so clearly:)

Best of luck, I know words like those can hit hard, but she is a young child and they sometimes even say things they dont fully mean, as well as forget what they say!"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,Did you spoke about it with her wife ? How she feels toward you now versus then ?
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Remember that the truest sign of love is to do things even though they're hard. Stick to it, and then in twenty years she can bring a boyfriend/girlfriend home and you can embarrass her with this as a story.

It's a hard thing to hear though dude, so if you need to cry, then have a cry. You got this."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"What everyone else said but also, you might need to find a sweet spot with your meds ( as my doctor described it) depending on my dose of medicine (Guanfacine) I have the same side effects. On 4mg I was more serious, it was so much harder to be creative, oddly a little more anxious and I can really concrete but then it’s hard to switch tasks. but on 3mg I am the least anxious I have ever been, more creative, I can switch tasks more easily,  but my mood could be more up and down, etc. I was on 4mg for the last few months and just went back down. 

It’s kinda weird choosing like what person I want to be with the meds but yeah. You really have to do what works for you. You being that, is what’s best for your daughter."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Same with all stimulants imo, i smoke weed and i can notice the creativity diminish, i stop hyper fixating on my lil projects and drawings, stop talking so much, etc..."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"You seem like such a kind and loving parent, OP, and I'm sure she wouldn't be complaining about the effects of the meds if she actually understood the long term benefits for you and by proxy for her of treating your adhd. I usually take Saturdays off from my meds, so perhaps that could help?"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,Could you do like silly mornings and take your meds around noon
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Honestly thank you for posting this. I’ve seen kind of similar anecdotes/questions regarding adhd meds and I was on the fence about them. It is a struggle…hard…sometimes to focus and do what other people can just…do. My husband is luckily incredibly patient and I and also lucky in that occasionally I hyper focus on housework/organization so I just cycle. I’m only planning on having 1 (maybe eventually fostering) but I never realized that my willingness to just sit and play with her might possibly be attributed to adhd in a roundabout way. Again, thank you for posting as the decision between medicating and not was weighing on me and nothing was helping me decide. I’ll be silly at least for a few more years haha. As my one therapist said…I’ve made it this far in life without meds. 
My other therapist mentioned there were medications that weren’t stimulants. I’m not familiar with this one but I’m hoping that there are maybe other ones your doctor can suggest if you bring this issue up to him. 
Sending good vibes your way! Your daughter loves you either way! And while maybe you won’t be as “silly”, maybe you’ll be more active or be able to do other more structured things with her. Or even just being able to model a routine is crucial for her long term well being, and while she is upset at the change currently, it could benefit her in the long run!"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Talk to your doctor about medication vacations. Mine approved me to take a break from my meds if I just want to be “unproductive and relax”. The thing is, being productive and on is great as an adult, but people without ADHD aren’t always on or always off, they can relax normally on their days off. We’re entitled to be goofy, care-free, and what not now and then, and taking a day off of adhd meds really can help with that, but it has to be under the guidance of your doctor."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,Have you tried playing videogames with? They're a great way to have fun and bring creativity without bringing it yourself
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Do you miss that side of your or do you just miss the connection? If you don’t want to change anything and your connection with your daughter is the only thing that’s changed, I would work on finding a less silly thing to connect with her about. Maybe it’s a game where the creative/imaginative stuff is there and you just have to help her navigate it. Or getting out and doing things with her now that you’re more organized and motivated. Kids change constantly so I think there’s a way you can “fix” this while staying on your meds, you need to figure out an age appropriate way to explain the change and find something new to bond over. 

That said, Zoloft made me very emotionally disconnected when I took it in the past. I’m finding that I’m able to connect better with my son while I’m on my current meds (Buproprion XL and adderall XR) because I feel more present, less foggy and more “me.” I understand not wanting to mess with the balance that you’ve found, but I would talk to your doctor or psychiatrist and get their input on whether you could adjust meds to get those aspects of your personality back without sacrificing what you’ve gained."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"So I'm not an expert by any means - so talk to your doctor. My partner has ADHD as well - and experienced the same issues with Dex. Talk to your doctor and see if Vyvanse would be a good option for you. He found all the same benefits on Vyvanse but none of the issus at all. 

We can't get Vyvanse in NZ (so we are currently planning trips to fly to Australia to get it)."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"In addition don't forget that with kids persistence matters now than details so she could hold your ""less fun"" state against you for a year and forget it by the time she turns 8.  She'll never forget having a consistent living father, even if you're ""boring"" sometimes.  You're doing the right thing taking care of yourself and looking for more ways to engage with her.  Give it time, it'll be fine."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,Kids say mean shut all the time. I know it’s hard but don’t take it personal. Tell her that hurts your feelings
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"First and foremost, that sort of response is par for the course with any 4 yo, IMO. My daughter is upstairs currently throwing a tantrum, and she keeps yelling “I don’t want you, I want daddy!”. (I’m laid up in the basement, 1 day out from knee surgery, otherwise I’d be helping). If I WERE to be up there, she’d be likely to say the same thing the moment that I backed up my wife and agreed with her “no phone” statement that started the whole tantrum. Which is now over, all within a minute……
Anyways. I can’t help you with the medicine. I’m a 10x better dad ON my meds, I couldn’t force myself to even interact with them when my meds were off.  But I’m used to the instantaneous switch from “I love you daddy” to “I want mommy!” And back. That’s common, at least at my house. My daughter, whose mind works a lot like mine, is just trying to figure out which parent will give her what she wants. You may not be QUITE as much fun to play with while on that medication, but you have to be a “parent” as well, aka a functioning adult. If that what those meds make you, that’s just going to have to be a side affect that you’re going to have to work at overcoming.
Now, that being said, don’t be afraid to try something different. Tell this to your prescriber, maybe there’s something similar that they can try on you. Adderal had too many side effects for me, it was ruining my life being awake 22 hours a day, if not 24. I found a Dr that specializes in ADHD, she revamped everything that I’m taking, and after some experimentation, I’m very happy with the results. I’m still not as productive as I’d like, but I feel like “me” again. 
Good luck, I know that it sucks to hear that statement, but in many ways, if you DON’T hear that statement, you may not be “parenting” enough? So in a way, it could be confirmation of being a good parent, even though it sucks to hear? Just my opinion."

4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Are you sure it's just ""struggling to connect"" and not you actually being short with her?  That's a pretty bold statement coming from a kid.  

My meds definitely make me get caught up in hyperfocusing on things other than the people around me so I can relate to that, but for some people they actually get moody and snap at others if they're interrupted or when the meds wear off in the evenings.  If this is happening you need to acknowledge it because there are ways to lessen those side effects without quitting the medication altogether.  Dosage reduction, taking smaller taper down doses throughout the day, eating more in the afternoon/evening, etc can all help even out the comedown.  

However the advice others have given (that your daughter probably just wants you to be crazy freewheeling daddy) is on the nose.  As long as your meds aren't making you uptight and cranky, there's no problem and you should continue taking care of your mental health.  She's a kid; she'll adjust."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"I hate this effect of my meds abd switched off of it as a result.  Started wellbutrin 2 weeks ago abd its amazing.  Not as good at focus as stimulants, but better for me"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,I have a kid and I went through something similar. I think after a while you get a bit more used to the medication and can be both. That silly spontaneous person is still you and you can let that part out when it’s responsible to do so. It takes effort on your part to have that connection time be part of your life. My son is also a lot happier when I show up on time to his school plays and remember his schedule. We still play games till 2am but it’s just a Friday night thing now.
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Idk how much this will mean to you OP, but I used to say this to my mother about my father. Now, I'm a big ol daddy's girl. I'm 26.

He was just cranky because he had a factory job, depression, and a few other things. He was never abusive.

My dad has mellowed out over the years as well.

Tbf, I was also diagnosed as depressed at 8 years old."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"I stopped taking my medication when my daughter was young for the same reason. I started again when she was a teenager and although it wasn’t as bad, I still have reservations to this day.

The meds make me more productive but also make me ‘distanced’. I try not to use them every day.

These days I feel like meds make me ‘a more useful capitalist drone’ and I’m not sure whether that is a good thing or a bad thing, it just allows me to ‘fit’ more in a world, I think, Is detached from real values over productivity.

Id like to get off meds and feel less detached but I’m not sure I could live successfully that way…

Thanks for listening to my somewhat depressing Tedtalk!"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,Best way to describe myself off of dex is squishy.
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"When I started meds I lost friends because I wasn't as ""fun"" anymore. I was in my early 20s and on a far to high dose. It took years to find a balance and the right Rx that kept me on track but didn't kill my personality.  It also needs adjusting regularly."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Think long term. She will get over it and you will be able to support her in a lot of more ways then being funny. Being reliable, driving her to friends, keeping her schedules in mind and thousand other things that will be incredibly important to her when she gets older and will define the image she has of you."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"I'm not going to read through the rest of the comments so sorry if this is a re peat. Children don't like changes, if you had been on dex for a long time she wouldn't dislike you, she's just not used to how you are now. So I think she'll get used to it. I don't recommend coming off the mess just for her sake. If you wanted you could not take it in the weekends and she learn that there is a ""busy dad"" and a ""playtime dad"" which is normal, parents aren't ment to be fun all of the time."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,Try getting her to lead the conversations and play times — your ability to focus will help you listen to her and having her talk it out will help her better explain her feelings; don’t take it to heart — she just needs to understand and get used to it. Taking Sundays off of the Dex to hang out and watch cartoons and chill with her may also help
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"If it’s really that important to you, you could have 1 day a week (or even just every now and then) without your Dex that’s dedicated to spending time with her, or doing like a fun, silly daddy-daughter day.

But most importantly, she doesn’t need a friend or a clown to entertain her, she needs a DAD. Someone who is going to feed, clothe her and get her to appointments on time. It’s not as fun or rewarding, but that stuff is really important. 

And she’s 4. Kids that age say horrible things all the time, I’m sure she doesn’t really mean it.

Keep it up, you sound like an amazing dad, mate."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Can you change up your dosage so your meds wear off by evening time? I'm only medicated 8-5, I don't want to be medicated when I'm at home."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,I would guess this has more to do with your daughter being 4 then with you changing meds.
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"I had a kind of emotional blunting effect on Vyvanse. I became very logic based and more brisk and matter of fact. So I was prescribed dexamphetamine, which I take three times a day. The shorter acting time means I can pick and chose when I’m productive or when I want to be a bit more silly or emotional. I take mine in the morning, then leave the afternoon for time with my son. Then another just as everything’s winding down so I can get some stuff done in the evening. I’m in U.K. so i don’t know if that would be a possibility for you?"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Like everyone has said, you’re being a good father and she is having a reasonable 4 year old response to the change.

That being said, remember too that you will adjust to your medication! I was quite robotic when I first started medicating and my partner would feel upset that I wasn’t as playful and silly as I was before. But as you adjust to your meds, you often get many of those innate traits back!! I am way more playful now than I was a year ago, and this hasn’t even changed with upping my dose because that’s who I am as a person a the end of the day. I suspect you will gain some of your “fun” dad playfulness back, but you’ll also be able to be a more attentive and responsible father!"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"I agree with everyone that says you should focus on yourself. Make time for your girl when you can but ultimately this is for you!  
I only take Adderall XR for 5/7 days per week. My ""off"" days are reserved for playing with my kids, since I too am quite silly and spontaneous without my meds. There are weeks where I can't be off my meds and those are harder for my kids. I do spend time explaining that it is important for me to take them so I can make money for when we can play together."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"I've noticed the same effects from finally being medicated. I got my Xmas shopping done this year, and got everything wrapped in time with minimal stress, but in the past I would go nuts trying to make each gift meaningful and personal, a lot of them made by me personally. And I would be very creative with my wrapping, every gift personalized. This year I put everything into an appropriately sized box, wrapped it and labeled it with the recipients' and my names. I'm happy to be less stressed, but there is a definite sacrifice. Fortunately there are still plenty of other creative things I like to do- my nephew and I played airplane on my parents' hammock and later threw his rubber lizard ""into space"". I don't know what to recommend you do, but I know that that creative part is still in you, you just might need to tap into it."

4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"My niece at 4 yo was constantly telling her mom (my sister) about her “prettier mom” from planet Zeytacar, and why can’t she be like her, and that  my sister wasn’t her “real mom”. Which was hurtful for my sister to hear, given that those are her specific insecurities (thinking she’s a bad mom and that she’s not pretty- both untrue). Niece grew out of it. Now her insults stay themed to earth. 

I think even very young kids who know you well also know you well enough to know your insecurities a little and when they are lashing out, or even just kinda trying to manipulate a situation, they know how to fling out a zinger. But that’s totally normal for kids and I think is a normal response to being disciplined or sticking to your guns as the adult. 

Wait til she starts screaming that you ruin her whole life and that you’re the worst dad on earth (the insults my niece now prefers at 7 yo). You’re a great dad tho. Great parents are guaranteed to get verbally berated by their kids sometimes. Such is the way."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"I was sitting with my young niece yesterday as she was raging about playing Fantasy Friends on the Switch. She was arguing with her siblings who wanted to play Harry Potter. After a few minutes their mum asked my niece what game she wanted to play. She said Harry Potter.

Dont worry about what kids say, they seem to barely even know what they say."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"My ex used to tell me she could tell when I was on my meds because I was much more serious and focused, and that I had a lot more personality when I wasn't on them and I was funnier and more spontaneous. 

I used to take off a few days a week or every other week from my meds to stop from building a tolerance, detox, and relax a little. I'd typically do this on weekends when I'd go out with her so it worked out. You may want to try that if you can do that with Dex. Ask your doctor. 

I also have spent the last 2 years without really taking many breaks because my job, business, and life in general don't allow me time to have those days where I'm generally unproductive and just fuck around. Through this time my personality, goofiness, and spontaneity have come back a lot and I am generally more like I was before the meds (been on them about 4 years). It just took me a little to relearn and refind my personality. You can work on that too.

Edit: not all psychoeffective drugs are the same so I'll say I'm on Adderall (dextroamphetamine and lysdexamphetamine) which doesn't have a build-up period like some other meds."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Do not cut the dex, in 10years that will be your average day  "" I HATE YOU , YOU DON'T UNDESRTAND ME, YOU NEVER TRY , I WISH I HAD ANOTHER FATHER"" it's just training for adolescence. you should call your parent to ask them about terrible thing you told them when you were young"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"I’m a nanny and I struggled with the same thing at the beginning. Once you get used to the meds, you’ll feel more like yourself. I usually plan in a way that I leave a hour or two unmedicated with the kids and those hours are playtime. I do it because I’m more creative without meds, but with meds I’m more organise for tidying up/bed time/ cooking and even discipline. That’s how I resolve it, but now I’m also more used to the meds so I found my way to be creative with my new slower and calmer brain. Hope it helps"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"this is definitely a different attitude than most people in this sub, but I was in a relationship with someone on a very high dose of adderall and it functionally ruined it. It’s not great for relationships but good for productivity. there are tradeoffs with any drug unfortunately."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"My only suggestion alongside a lot of the great advice you have is: take a slightly lower dose of Dex when you know you will be engaging with your daughter and not have to be super productive with work or household things

I mean like, if you plan to spend the morning or afternoon with your kid, you could time your Dex and still take it, but a lower dose. So you still have focus, but your less INTENSE PRODUCTIVE focused

This will work better if you're on dex tablets not Dex SR.

Like if 10mg dex is your morning dose, you could try 5 or 7.5, and then take your normal afternoon 10mg 2nd dose if you had morning hangouts with her

Everyone here has good advice but I personally don't enjoy being on my full dose of Vyvanse when I'm just chillin. I'll take 20-25mg instead of 30mg vyvanse when I want a relaxed focus on a day off."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Is there someone adult in your life who you trust who's really observant? 

There's a past person in my life who went on Dex and all the same things became better for them -- but their speech sped up, their vocal style changed profoundly, and it really affected the rest of us.  

They sounded pissed, impatient, all the time. Whatever we were doing there was a constant jitter in the background of ""Are we done with *this* yet? 'cause I got  Other Things To Do"" -- 

The feeling came  across really strong that *this* was sorta stupid and the Other Things were way more important. 

That's not how *they* felt, it's not what they *wanted* to convey, but their accelerated speech, more pressurized airflow, and constant foot tapping really made it seem that way. 

Is it possible you're ""reading"" differently to your daughter? 
Could someone neutral and smart listen in and let you know?"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"I have a five year old and had a similar experience. The connection being a bit less fun and goofy after meds. But that loss is more than offset when I see that my wife isn't constantly exhausted, harried and grumpy all the time and had the energy to interact with the kids in a fun way. The family as a unit is working a lot better with two adults instead of a single mum parenting three children on her own.

Also my five year old might be missing the ten books at night time and the goofy play  but she's also getting to school on time, can play safely in the backyard now that it's clean and has two parents making sure her teeth are clean, she has enough rest, and she is keeping up with her piano and reading etc.

That intense drive to get stuff done isn't permanent. At some point you'll catch up to all that things you've put off and had to be done and allow yourself to be appropriately goofy and silly. The five year old will also begin to appreciate the new dependable you."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Can I also just add that all things in life ebb and flow. Including aspects to your own personality and relationships. 
I'm the certified silly one in our family, and there are times my kids want me and not my wife and sometimes it's the other way around. Time period can be a few hours or a few weeks.

Sure, you can take a med holiday, or but take it at certain times or days, but also give yourself some time to get used to it. Kids have a way of picking at our insecurities though they don't mean it. I'm sure there are positive aspects she's yet to verbalize or maybe you've even yet to discover. My youngest loves puzzles but it takes a lot of patience and focus for me to sit through with one and the meds help, and he loves it and because I can sit there with him, I get to be a part of that."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"She wants spontaneous excitement. I mean heck I don't have hyper fixations on meds and I miss them but I can do all the hobbies I found I loved through those fixations now. 

You have to explain it to her in ways she can grasp. 


""You know how it feels when your sad or angry or feel sick? Old daddy felt that way all the time so he was silly to try and feel better.  So a doctor  helped me feel better. I am a little different but it's still me and I love you. And now I don't feel bad all the time. 

I had to ask for help. And I need your help too. to find new ways to have lots of fun together.

Idk something like that. Kids don't understand adhd. But they understand sadness and anger. When she's older you can explain in more detail. And if you get her involved in helping it will help her adjust to the changes. 

My recommendation is start getting craft projects and use your newfound time to take her to get treats or or to parks or the zoo together. There's tons of craft kits for various ages. You may not be as off the wall creative but craft projects are a structured event that should be easy for you to get involved. And because it's a new item it will be a spontaneous play time for her."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,She might also be more uncomfortable with the fact that she perceives a difference than the nature of the difference.
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Man, I don't want to invalidate you, not my intention, but could this be a case of you're putting too much pressure on yourself?

The silliness doesn't come as easily so maybe you start to worry she isn't having as much fun so you start to look for signs that she isn't and then couple that with a 4 year old being moody as they sometimes are and you're jumping straight to, ""She hates who I've become!""

Either way, man, I feel for you and am hoping for the best."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"I feel this way. When I’m on medication it really helps but I feel like I’m not fun anymore. With my kids and with my friends. No one has said anything but I feel it. I even notice my facial expressions aren’t as wild and my wrinkles have softened!! 😳

I have to go out today with friends to a pub and I want to take my meds because I haven’t taken them for a few days over Christmas so I could have some drinks and I’m feeling myself becoming depressed so I need to take them but I know I’ll be bored and boring. Maybe I just never realised my friends are a bit boring? 

It’s very hard to deal with. I’ve been taking my meds during the week and them breaking on weekend so I can be a little fun and spontaneous  🤷‍♀️"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"If you were suddenly working more often and not there for some moments, she’d probably say the same thing. Talk to your doctor, there’s obviously a middle ground you’d like to find between medicated and not."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"4 years old is the magical ""Daddy'Little Girl"" age. It doesn't last long, which is both good and bad. Your silly will return, but she may be beyond that by then.."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,Not advice but… that’s my combo too!
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"You might be less ""fun"" to her, but you're job as a parent isn't to have fun with her, it's to raise her to be the best person she can be. Are you a better, more organized, attentive parent that way?"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,Lets say the amphetamines dex Ritalin and a bunch others messed me up just ditch them
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"I feel this big time. I can't say my 3yo daughter said the same thing, but I realized she was playing on her own more. Being more independent in general, and my eye opener was her coming to me in the kitchen while I was doing dishes one evening and she was holding her favorite book. ""Daddy you read with me?"" 

I'll tell you what man. Nothing can make a grown man weak like the feeling of failing as a father. I have managed to make her and my other 2 kids a part of my daily mental checklist. My wife and I work opposite shifts so it's easy for me to get sidetracked with housework, but I've got into a habit of doing 2 things around the house, play with the kids. 2 things, kids. Eventually it just becomes normal"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Your daughter needs a father who can adult, not a play pal. Maybe your medicine can be tweaked."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"How is Dexedrine? Is it a drug to be taken continuously (like Strattera) or on as-needed basis (Aderall,Ritalin)? If the latter, why not take weekly drug holidays eg on weekends and play with your daughter as your usual self?"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"I add something else… I don’t know how to put it into words as to not offend the excellent replies below…reasoning and explaining things rationally to a 4 yo is all good but they need maybe a 20% of that, and the rest 80% must be playful silliness. I myself am guilty of being too brainy with my child (it’s just my personality) and I have wished thousand times to be able to just be light and playful as it is appropriate when interacting with a small child. Play is their language. For the life of me I don’t understand how a person who is naturally so as OP, would get convinced it is ok to just lose that. If there was a (safe) drug to take to become like OP naturally is, I would take it pronto. I d say.. my 0.02$: take your useful meds as needed, and be free of them weekly: it will help restore your relationship with daughter and also be good for your brain. Of course, assuming your needs do not HAVE TO be taken continuously (I don’t know about that)."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"explain to her, in a way she can understand, that although youre not as ""fun"" as you used to be, youre like this now cause you want to be happier and feel better, and it may suck now for her, but sometimes things have to change for the better, even if they hurt.

just be there for her as much as you can, show her you love her regardless. she may be upset for now, but she will learn to accept it."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"I think you should speak to your doctor. The thing I didn't used to understand is that we aren't supposed to feel different on meds, we're just supposed to be able to concentrate, a slightly lower dose could be the ticket. There are so many medications to try out. Vyvanse made me so flat and I didn't feel like myself. So I didn't like to take it. I switched to IR Adderall, and don't have that issue at all."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,This might seem like a random answer but I have seen some mommy blogs that say smoking weed then playing with your kid can make you more silly in a good way. It could be something to try on weekends.
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"I've also felt like this on my meds. I'd suggest you skip it on the weekends and spend extra time with her then, or consider lowering the dosage. If you are on an extended-release medication, you could also consider a short-acting version that wouldn't last as long and might wear off after the workday."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Ok, I have a thought. Answer this honestly: are you using more (even slightly more) than prescribed? No judgments at all, but if you are, I think that may be a piece of this. If you answer me, I can tell you more about why I think this is."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"I totally understand the issues with medication, that they can make me feel robotic and less fun and spontaneous, and out of touch emotionally. For myself, I've found the type of medication affects this a lot. I'm currently on vyvanse and it's less of an issue as compared to short acting or dexedrine spansules, and I tried adderall several years ago which affected me negatively like that really badly. I also know for myself, this feeling is often the worst in the evening when ""crashing"" from the medication.

For me personally, I don't take my medication every day now, and take it strategically (i.e., never take it on the weekends, don't take it most days of the week). I try to manage my adhd with exercise, timers, and lists, whether I'm on or off medication, but I think the days without medication help me feel like myself and reconnect with my goofier side! If you're feeling OK without medication every day you could try that approach and plan extra adventures with your kids on those days. Also, maybe getting some exercise in the evening can help with the medication wear off and rejuvenate yourself/clear your head. I know for myself transitioning out of work mode and into home/fun mode takes time and doesn't happen automatically, so giving myself a ritual like working out or going on a walk when I'm done with work for the day really helps.

Also, totally agree with the other comments that kids can be harsh and it might not mean too much, or be too related to the medication and could just be a phase! I totally understand that that would hurt my feelings though. But if you are feeling robotic and less like yourself that definitely might be a sign to change how you use it (like I do, strategically) or trying a different medication or dose."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,Would it be possible to reduce the dosage and potentially strike a better balance between your no-meds personality and your current on-meds (based on your current intake) personality?
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Hey op, can I have an update on your situation?"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"To add to this excellent reply, OP could explain in 4yo terms why he’s changed."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"I suspect this is also partly why so many people swear off meds as a kid, only to rediscover them as adults. When you’re a kid, you want to be silly, spontaneous and impulsive. You don’t have all the organizational responsibilities nor much experience with the satisfaction that comes from getting your work done, well.

I’d posit that this makes young children associate meds only with feeling “weird”, “not themselves” and anxious — they don’t understand/expect the physiological changes like needing more water or increased heart rate. They don’t associate it with organization, education or personal growth cause *what 6 year old is thinking about these things?*

(It also doesn’t help that kids may not know what effects to look out for, may not be able to effectively communicate that their dose/meds are wrong, or may have patronizing parents/doctors who dismiss their complaints about side effects)"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,This. Apparently I screamed and cried for a few days as a young kid…..because my dad shaved off his mustache. Kids also don’t tend to do well with change.
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"My oldest is 11. When she was 4 we took a big vacation and during that she would respond to things she didn't like by telling me she liked her mom's house better and she wanted to go back to her mom's.

As a dad who got just every other weekend with her, I was fucking devastated. It felt like she was some evil genius who had researched exactly how to hurt me the worst. I wilted, I cried, I caved.

Then after a few days of her acting out and me being miserable, I realized she's 4 and I'm the dad, and that's a horrible thing to say to somebody. It was MY job to teach her how to act and to respect the people around her.

Next time she did it, I told her that she was allowed to feel that way but it wasn't a nice thing to say, and I didn't want to hear it any more. She pushed back, I doubled down.

After that it was like a light switch, she was great and respectful and sweet. Kids need boundaries and they need a parent who loves them and also is firm with them. That includes consequences for being hurtful and breaking rules.

Teach her why you need your medicine, how it makes you feel, and that she might not think it's fun but it's not her right to say things that hurt your feelings."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,nobody likes me when i take my meds because it makes me serious and focused
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"My son went through the same thing, he was the class clown, but also frequently disrupted the class, and was nearly 3 years behind in school by 10yo.  After he got medicated, he caught up on school within the year, but people were always telling him how they missed 'fun Tyler', it caused him quite a of conflict."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Yeah this.
Your little girl needs you to be a functional daddy.
Let the meds settle and you will find a healthy balance and play with her.
You dont have to be perfect.
You are doing great."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Preschool educators knowledge is underrated. This is a perfect response. 
I'm a ps teacher and my kids noticed when i went on meds too, it wasn't so much a negative thing but they definately notice changes in personality of the people they trust. I had a comment from a girl (4yo) who's a bit talkative saying she likes me now because I ""talk for a long time"" like I don't get distracted and wander off to other children ect. It wasn't apparent to me that I did that until she mentioned it. Connecting with children can be difficult and you have to find a way that works for yourself and the child, if that means taking a different approach entirely then that's that."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,Agreed. She’s a kid. She will forget this and move on. Try not to take it personally.
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"No better reply, i agree."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"This is a great response. I would qualify it by saying that the change to your personality can be felt negatively by adults as well. What I mean is that the change is not always related to being more responsible and less impulsive. I feel less warm, less patient, less friendly on my meds. Less affectionate with my spouse. It’s a trade off that I have to live with. It’s a real thing I struggle with because like OP I’m less myself medicated and less the free thinker."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"As someone who’s heart literally broke and eyes welled up with tears for personal reasons reading the main post, I’m so so so grateful your comment was the the very first one i read means so much to me because you really truly validated the necessity of my medication. I don’t know how to say it right now. Just thank you"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"This is spot on and great advice. I also use that combo except Vyvanse.  I’ve experienced the same with being so focused and task-directed. All I’d add is you have to do a cost/benefit analysis in totality. Ie, sounds like you are much a much better father/husband/provider and, most importantly, have markedly better self-esteem with meds. So the scales seem overwhelming tilted towards meds. 

You can always be “fun and spontaneous dad” when you take a break 1 or 2x/wk. 

That’d what I do. 

You are super lucky to have found such an effective combo and success with meds. Congrats!"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"What a superb response - thanks so much. This is in line with what my wife told me too - she said she’s 4, you know she loves you and I think you’re being a better parent on the meds. That probably says it all. But there’s no doubt I’m different too, and it’s that part and the love and bond I’ve worked hard to develop with her which makes it hard to bare jeopardising it.

Over the last few days I’ve tried really hard to bond with her more, while medicated, and had some luck. I’d be lying if I said we had quite the same level of joking and humour, but I was able to give her many more experiences than I would usually have the mental energy or organisational skill to do, and she asked for me to put her to bed tonight over Mummy, at which point my heart could have literally exploded! ❤️"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,I love your response
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,Thank you for recognizing the possible extra work-load the spouse/partner has had to manage.
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,Wonderfully articulated!
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"""Secure your own mask first"" is something I say to myself on a regular basis about taking care of my stuff first before trying to tend to getting the kids ready.

Coffee is my best example. Kids have their list of wants and needs every day. My day starts with caffeine. Without that stimulant, I can't tend to the needs of 3 kids and 2 dogs."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,That’s a fantastic way to approach things that I never thought of before. Solid advice here
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,What stress will you put your family thru if you cant pay the bills or have a roof over their heads due to mental illness?
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,Legend says I cried hysterically and refused to talk to my dad for a week after he shaved his beard.
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"My 5yo daughter couldn’t look at me without laughing hysterically when I did this. She hadn’t seen me without it, five years of good growth and all she did was laugh uncontrollably and call me bald haha (shaved my short hair too)"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"While this is true, especially since the kid is 4, it's still important to acknowledge the child's feelings. Validating it and explaining the reason for the parent's change as self care and good in the long run seems better than ignoring it."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"This has made me realize that my father likely has untreated adhd. You pretty much described my childhood and then teenage years. My dad was always the fun parent, and at times made questionable choices. We are really similar and I felt like he was the only one I could connect to in my family. Most of that was likely similarly presenting adhd, we both seek dopamine from food, stay up until 2am, spend hours a day watching movies, will drive for 8 hours straight and enjoy it, spend most of our time in our own heads, and make choices that my mom doesn’t understand. My brother was diagnosed with adhd when he was little but for him it mostly caused quick intense anger. I’ve recently realized that having adhd would make sense of my entire life and since it is often inherited, both of us kids having it makes it more likely that my dad does too. As I got older I found it harder to connect with him as he is so out of touch with his emotions and conversation was rarely something he was interested in. Sorry this comment is so long, I know you probably don’t care but you totally just helped me realize this, thank you!"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,“Do not stop medication on the advice of a 4-year old” had me busting a gut.  Good and hilarious advice.
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"I agree with most of your post except for the first sentence.

This isn't about father vs friend.

It's about the lack of connection that they are **both** feeling.

He just needs to find a new way to create and maintain a connection with her while on medication."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Respectfully, these are not the only alternatives."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Exactly this! There might be some difficulties connecting regardless, but that feeling might especially come from Dad trying to navigate the world from a new perspective! It could be as simple as kiddo watching a tv show recently where either the kids didn’t like the dad or the dad seemed somehow more exciting than her own dad. Or, it could be that she got frustrated with him or embarrassed in front of him about something and instead of being able to understand those feelings, her best approximation is “want a new dad”. 


When I was between 2 & 5, here are some of the weird things I did or said:

- “mommy when are you going to die so I can marry daddy?” (Cringe!!!!)

- I wouldn’t let my dad come into my room or even say good night to me one night because he farted earlier and it smelled bad and I was upset about it. 

- i made my parents a card, and on the inside there was a heart with a big X through it because apparently I was mad at them 

Small humans just don’t know what to do with big feelings sometimes, not to mention understanding where those feelings come from. It’s always good to talk to kiddos about their feelings in simple terms “is there something daddy is doing that you don’t like, or are you just in a mommy mood?”  “It makes daddy sad that you said that, because he loves you so much and wants to be your best daddy in the whole world! Is there something that makes you sad?”"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"This can very a lot from person to person and med to med. 

I'm able to go med free most weekends and I get a lot out of taking a break here and there, but I have a support network and I'm on medication that still functions with breaks. 

Because I'm medicated most of the time, I can afford to take an actual day off because I'm caught up to chores, life responsibilities, etc."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"You are not anyone's doctor, so you should not being telling anyone to ""not take med holidays ever."""
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,Exactly this!
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,Thanks so much for sharing that. I’m thinking about doing something like this.
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,I love that light analogy
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"I could take breaks. Perhaps I should. It’s just hard to go back to the old me. While I can be more fun and creative, I’m otherwise useless on so many fronts. I can barely get myself to take a shower, let alone go to the gym, tidy up, or actually deliver on anything of any substance. My wife also ends up having to do more, which creates friction between us.

Do other people experience this shortfall of meds too?

You’re right that I can give a methylphenidate medication a try too. I’m yet to do that though, mostly because the Dex is otherwise so good.

One other thing that comes to mind is while I’m a less fun Dad perhaps, I also think I’m in some ways a better Dad. On Dex, I could make it to her clubs on time, I could imagine supporting her through activities and challenges, and taking the time (and having the focus) to invest I her hobbies. Off Dex I may be able to make her laugh more, but I may not be there for her in the same way I could. Just a thought."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"I totally understand. I agree that you can’t waive it off - she said those things for a reasons, and I can feel the change in myself which is why it hurt so bad. I guess the question is either a) will the effect lessen over time, or b) can I fill that void with other fun activities and joint activities together. I’e tried really hard over the last few days and while I’ve not been quite the same fun, silly daddy, we’ve still had some fun and have done A LOT more activities together than I’d ever usually manage."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Thanks so much man. It really means a lot to hear someone who has been there say that. I’ve been trying extremely hard over the last few days to engage her. I don’t know that it’s quite the same from a humour perspective, but certainly we’re doing a lot more together than I’d ever usually have the mental energy or organisation skill to do ,and she wanted me to put her to bed tonight which was incredibly rewarding to hear ❤️"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"That’s awesome news! So do you feel like your full self again, but more productive? Xx"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Thanks so much. I’ve actually tried Adderall before as I used to live in the states, but I found it a bit to physically stimulating relative to the Dex. I think I’m going to try a methylphenidate based med. they seem to get a less good rap on some of these forums, but I believe they’re considered to be as effective."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Thanks so much for this. I’m think I’m going to try a methylphenidate based med too. Dex is great (and the best of the amphetamine based meds I’ve tried), but I have to admit that I do feel somewhat different to myself, and if I could have the symptom relief without the personality changes it would be the dream."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"I feel like they massively help my symptoms and I can achieve so much more in life, but part of why the comment hurt so much is that I do feel slightly different (and guilty as a consequence)."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"I wrote my response last night and thinking about it more, I wanted to emphasize the transition out of work mode comment! That's actually a huge need for me, and my dad said a similar thing about raising me and my sister (he's not on medication but totally ADHD). I feel much more socially awkward or short or emotionally distant if I don't get a little transition time, even though in the moment I often don't feel like I need that at all. For me this could either be a little walk, or a proper workout, or a ""nap"" where I don't really fall asleep but just veg for like 10 or 15 minutes. I think that's a common thing with ADHD in general (hard time set shifting), and kind of made worse by medication for some people, and not super intuitive. So yeah, trying to give yourself a little intentional transition time out of responsibility mode and into bonding/playing with your kid mode might have a big impact on your mood as you transition from one role to the other! I have a 2 month old baby and I'm realizing how important that is for me right now (I also appreciate how limited time is, so doing that in a way to give your partner a break, like going on a walk with your kids or something might work?)

There's really great advice in here! I kind of want to share this with a friend who is nervous about starting medication, cause you can see how varied peoples responses are and how there are so many strategies to manage any unpleasant side effects through playing with type/dose/timing, or behavior around the medication."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Thanks for the response. Out of interest, what did you switch to?"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Thanks so much for the response. Out of interest, what did you switch to?"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,What happen? Did you develop any long term side effects? I'm on Dex and was wondering what the long term side effects may be..
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,Really good advice. Thanks so much for sharing that. Are you still taking your medication? Do you feel like you’ve been able to bring your relationship back up to the same sort of level?
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Honestly, I’ve found it quite hard not to take it in weekends I think it’s a combination of going from productive to useless, as well as perhaps that you’re body needs some downtime to recover after stints of taking Dex, so I find myself feeling exhausted when I do. If anyone has any advice on this front I’d be all ears."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"This is interesting. I’m going to think about this. I think she would understand, just need to reflect on how to approach it a bit. I also may try some other meds first."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Thanks. This is really interesting. I think I’m going to chat to him about trying a methylphenidate based medication all the studies seems to show they’re equally effective, although I tend to hear less positive views on forums. Regardless, if I can feel myself but also productive, that would be the dream."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"I’m not, but I’m certainly intrigued as to what the connection could be here."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Hey man. It’s a lot better thanks. I’m still a little different, but I’ve learnt to explore other parts of myself and I have more energy to do fun activities with the girls. I also sometimes have days off on weekends so I reconnect with the more spontaneous round side of myself. I tend to see them more as a tool now - they don’t cure everything, but the advantages outweigh the disadvantages most of the time."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,Im a lifeguard who teaches kids to swim and I'm always looking for ways to explain and talk to them what would you suggest as a 4yo explanation?
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,There’s a kids book I’m trying to get a hold of right now called “Sam Squirrel Has ADHD”. That might be helpful in explaining the situation.
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"This!!! People really underestimate their children’s ability to understand complex ideas! I remember as a young child I was trying to use some form of manipulation on my dad so I could get what I wanted, and he told me in a serious but gentle tone that what I was doing was called manipulation, and that’s not a nice thing to do to people - especially people you love. I was quite young, but I knew from that point on not to do that anymore. He never had to hit me to get me to understand, just simply explain to me that the action I was doing was bad, and not that it was me that was bad. Seriously important!"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,Both these things!
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Lol all the examples below are super complex sentences for a 4yo. I don't think you have to explain anything, just emphasize loving her and have fun with her. Through your actions."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"This, 100%. Pair that with puberty and weight loss from decreased appetite. I still feel weird from Adderall in ways I can’t always fully articulate today and I’m in my 30’s. But I can’t deny that it helps me get motivated."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Same. I apparently ""hated"" my dad when I was 4 and he shaved off the big bushy beard and mustache he had my whole life until that point. 

You're right, kids don't do well with change."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,They really are good at pushing buttons sometimes.
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"this is actually great advice even for older people, that you’re allowed to feel this way but there’s a right and a wrong as to how you should take action or approach the situation. i always try to tell myself this and it’s really made me all the wiser"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Do you like you when you take your meds? If people don't like you when you're doing what you need to do for yourself, did they really like you in the first place?"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Do you feel like they make you incapable of being any other way? Is it possible that a lower dosage would still allow you to do everything you need to do, but without feeling as serious?"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"No problem. Like everyone else here, I've been there lol. I hope you feel better about everything soon."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Go You! You've got this. Remember, people change, and things change, so you are also helping her get used to this and realize that you will love her during and after these changes. You are enriching the life of your family by being a better parent/spouse. Love yourself- your family obviously does."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"I heard tales of my dad shaving his 70s beard and Magnum P.I. mustache, apparently I was crying and refusing to let him hold me for days. Kids are dumb and there's a good reason why they should not be the decisionmakers in a household lol"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,I never said ignore it lol. I said don't beat yourself up.
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,I didn't feel it necessary to tell him he should do exactly what he's already done/doing lol.
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"No worries I'm glad to help someone realise it,  I get it's really validating to realise. I mean I would get so mad that my dad wouldn't listen to me, even when he asked the question (I also have issues with rejection sensitivity). Or in one story,  when there was a literal fire beside a neighbour's fuel tank and we had to wait until the weather forecast was over to get him to listen. It's so much easier to accept these now and appreciate him for who he is. Best of luck."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,Glad you got a laugh!

4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Ok. Thanks. Good point.

Edit my comment to read:
""ask your Dr if it's worth the yo yo"".
""Read the package insert and talk to your Dr, as recommended by the manufacturer, before intentionally deviating from your prescription.

Med holidays are typically for kids who need to catch up to growth, or for those who want to see if they still need them. """
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"I think you’ve kind of answered your own question there. You are a better dad, and a better partner, when you take your medication. 

Your daughter is only little, she doesn’t see or understand the organisational or behind the scenes stuff that goes into being a parent, so she doesn’t take that into account. But believe me, one day, and probably soon, she will start to notice when those things *do* go wrong all the time - the being embarrassed for always turning up to your clubs late, the social consequences of having an unreliable/unorganised/constantly late parent, not feeling like you can go to your dad for help because they have too much on their plate already or can’t deal with “serious stuff”, etc., and that may well damage your relationship in an even worse and more long term manner. I love my parents (never diagnosed or medicated but for sure have ADHD), and I have ADHD myself (diagnosed and medicated), but I have so many painful memories of being mortified about them forgetting to take me somewhere, or forgetting to pick me up from school, or being late, or being embarrassed of my messy home, or them not being able to help me in the way I needed, or promising to help and not managing to keep that promise, and those feelings have had a huge effect on both my childhood and my adult life, and it’s hard not to feel some resentment, even though it’s not their fault. If you can do something to mitigate some of that, do it. 

The imagination and playing about can be fixed, adapted, explored - the fundamental functioning as a human being without medication can’t. You want to explore her hobbies with her, that’s amazing! What a fun process to find something you both enjoy doing together! Maybe it’s a bit different from before but it can still be fun! You may even have a better attention span to be able to dedicate your time to those activities with her and that’s so invaluable. You’re still the same person, the fun is still in there, it’s just might be coming out differently. That’s a complicated concept for a little kid, so to her it’s just “daddy is a different person”. But she doesn’t fully understand and she’s just saying what comes into her head - kids can be brutal but their perception is not always accurate. 

Don’t sacrifice your wife, your relationship, or your ability to be a good, reliable, safe father, for the whims of a 4 year old child who doesn’t understand what’s happening and just wants daddy to be a goofy clown right this second. Kids find change difficult, and bear in mind that your daughter may well also have ADHD or similar given the strong genetic link so might find it even more of a struggle, but luckily they also have shorter memories for these kinds of things at this age. You can find a way round it. Ask her what it is she misses or wants to do and work out some solutions, try some new stuff out, have fun!"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"If the dexamphetamine mostly agrees with you and you are considering something more long lasting, Vyvanse might be a better option as it works in a very similar way and would be easier to adjust than switching to methylphenidate (just my opinion I'm not a professional).
I take Vyvanse in 2 x doses and a later dose of dexamphetamine in the afternoon so I have a smoother experience throughout the day. I also take a low dose of SSRI to offset the irritation/ anxiety when the meds start to leave my system as I am a fast metaboliser, as soon as dopamine starts to drop my serotonin also drops causing the irritation and mood dip. 
I have only taken dex with Vyvanse so can't speak about it's effects by itself, I've heard of some folk experiencing emotional blunting with methylphenidate, or dex alone. 
Vyvanse seems to work well in this regard where I am better able to regulate my emotions without feeling blunt or numb, if anything I am very much in touch with them and there is more clarity in what I'm feeling."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"There's also strattera. I didn't feel so ""regimented""/ terse when I was on it."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"I experience this too and weekend breaks don't do it for me. I need to stop for at least a week to get the fun, humor, and creativity back and feel less boring and serious."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Please, please, please do not start changing or abandoning medication from the advice of untrained internet strangers. Talk to your doctor. If possible, try and help your daughter understand what's going on. She's undoubtedly very confused right now. But again, I implore you don't make changes to medication without talking to your doctor."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Talk to your doctor before taking med vacations. Works for some, but very very not good for others.  You don’t want to be struggling with parenting a toddler AND a med lapse/rebound/withdrawal.  Horrible combo, do not recommend."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"It's option B for me. I have to make a conscious effort to plan fun with my kids or else the meds make me hyper focused on my to-do lists or hobby-of-the-month. And, like you, when we do have activities, I feel like I'm way more into them and have the ability to teach them things too (proper crayon technique, all I've learned from playing Super Mario games all my life, etc) so play time is way more fulfilling for everyone.

But know you aren't alone. For us adult ADHD peeps, these are the things we deal with. When I forget to take my meds one day or take a med vacation, everyone knows haha."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Thanks so much. A really good point and I agree that the the transition can be hard. Our hyper focused tendencies probably make this worse as switching off from the depths of a work problem, and going into imaginary play with a young one, is quite a shift.

I think working from home makes this harder too. When I had a commute I could take some time to unwind in the car, train, bus or whatever, but walking straight from your home office into the depths of caring and playing with young kids and doing the whole dinner/bath/bedtime routine, can be a pretty difficult transition."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,Concerta. We played with the dosage starting small and ramping up from there.
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"I much prefer dexamphetamine sulphate, the instant release. I can control my dosing much better, which is useful as a shift worker. Some days I take my full dosing, other days I only take my first dose. The instant release also wears off at a fairly predicable point, which might help you be more playful in the evenings when you don't need to be productive."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,Strattera? Or something similar sounding. If my knee wasn’t the size of a cantaloupe I’d go look to be sure.
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,I was only on it for a year. Short term effects for me were severe agravation and dependancy that started about 6 months in. I put myself threw withdrawl by quitting cold turkey after i went on a rage and got myself arrested. Withdrawl sucked monkey balls. Long term effects im still having chronic fatigue 4 years after quitting. Im always tired and have no energy. Other than that no real long term effects but then i only took dex for a year.
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"I am no doctor but as far as I can reason, the tiredness when you stop is normal, as the stimulants push your CNS to become more active and it is tiring for the whole body. What goes up comes down... You need to give your body rest. Take vitamins and minerals. I would say you could try taking ginseng (red ginseng, the good one): to me or always have me a kick of energy. However on the ginseng you need to study how it works because if it stimulates the same neurotransmitters as dexedrine, you should not take it during a break. I didn' t need to do research about it (hence I don't know the answer to this) because I took ginseng only when totally clear of all meds. In fact it is so energizing/stimulating for me, that I need to cycle it: after 1 or /2 months daily intake I need to stop for a while."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"thats good. i know it must suck to see your child not liking you, especially when you didnt even do anything wrong, but you gotta do whats best for you, and eventually she will understand that its a good thing. good luck with your meds and the situation in general"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"You have to remember that they haven’t experienced much of the world yet so they’re mostly seeking fun and won’t understand why you may want them to do something that’s not fun.

You need to use the simplest terms possible. And you need to explain why you want them to do something, how it’ll impact them and give an alternative.

Ex. When kids spray you with a water gun, instead of saying “stop spraying me”, say “stop spraying me because I don’t want to get wet right now and if you spray me, I’ll get wet. We can play in a little bit after we learn to swim.” 

This makes it so that they can understand why you want them to stop, and gives them an alternative."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"One could try something like: “Daddy is trying to make his brain work better. I know I might seem a little different, but I will still always love you forever. What do you miss about/doing with Daddy?”

Also know many kids go through phases of liking one parent “best” for a while. And sometimes it can flip without warning. They can also sometimes act like drunk tyrant a-holes, say extremely mean things, and generally be jerks. If they do something particularly bad, you can try to talk to them after everyone’s emotions have cooled. It is ok to tell your kids why their words hurt your feelings and try to help them find a better way to process their emotions and express them in words. Takes practice, and isn’t ever perfect, but both parent and child can learn and get better at these kinds of things."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Simple sentences and analogies. For ADHD and meds:

“I have something called ADHD. For you, that means I am sometimes big and silly and fun. However, my silliness causes me problems when I am around other adults. I take a medicine that makes me be less silly so I can focus on bringing home money for our home and for food. I am sorry that my meds make me less fun and silly; I’ll try to bring that funny Daddy back if you will help remind me to be silly sometimes.”"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"re: explaining complex behavior changes like ADHD or explaining class behavior expectations or explaining a swimming or safety concept or? I’ve got a couple for each of those, and I’m a swim instructor who sometimes lifeguards so we are right up the same alley if you’re ever interested in chatting :)"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,Of course it’s a squirrel 😆
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,They can be evil genius manipulators.
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"""Feelings feel real, actions have consequences."""
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,I like getting stuff done but i dont particularly like my personality on them either
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"The voting on these comments tells me I don't know as much as I think I know. Thanks for enlightening me, u/XFactor-41, sincerely. I hope you found what you needed."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"My doctor encourages days off meds (usually weekends) so I don’t build up a tolerance. Also stimulants can be hard on your body, so days off can let your system rest."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"I knew the alternative/giving them a choice that ones super helpful, I'll keep the rest in mind! Thanks"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Even as a just barely an adult getting the ""why"" to explain the ""no"" makes it a lot easier to understand. I'm curious and I want to know why, so like if something says ""don't touch this"" it isn't as useful as ""don't touch this because it has a risk of electrical shock"" or something similar it gives the reason."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Also being concrete helps a lot—saying “we’ll do this in a little bit after we learn to swim” means something in the moment but doesn’t hold up well to young kids because it’s so abstract. Saying “we have to do 2 backfloats and then we can have a splash fight” is easier for them to grasp because it gives them a very clear idea of the expectations. (This said: using time as the indicator is NOT good for most kids this age because they don’t understand it and can’t read clocks. Saying “in 2 minutes” doesn’t have meaning, unless you have a digital clock that is hh:mm or just mm (seconds get it all mixed up I’ve found) and you can explain “the red numbers say 4-0-6. When they are 4-0-8 then we can splash really big” and even then it’s iffy on if it makes sense to them.)"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,It sucks being a kid trying to have fun and all but then someone scolded you out of the blue.
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"> What do you miss about/doing with Daddy?

I think this is a great question to ask the kid. Honestly, it's just as possible that something totally unrelated to the meds is bothering her because that's just how little kids are anyway, but if it is as OP suspects and she's noticing personality changes, hearing directly from her how she's experiencing that could be helpful for OP to know what to work on. Silliness may not come naturally while on meds, but it doesn't come naturally for some people at all, and it's possible to work at it. Knowing exactly what she feels is different will make it obvious what to focus on practicing so that she comes back around and feels like daddy is ""back to normal"" but better."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Along with asking what she misses about Daddy, also tell her that what she said made you sad. If you don't tell her, she won't learn that her words have an impact on other people, even adults."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"I might leave the ""bring home money for our home"" part out of it. They probably are too young to grasp it but I hated worrying about my effect on my parents financial security. 

I think the rest is worded great! Maybe just say less silly so I can do a great job at work."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,The hidden advantage to explaining it to her in some detail is that she may recognize some of this in herself when she gets older and seek help for it sooner
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Oh look, a squirrel!"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"I hear that. I felt that way on a handful of the options: Ritalin, Dexedrine, Adderall, Concerta... Currently on a low dose of Vyvanse and like it a lot more. Find I can keep my personality and spontenaity more while still feeling the positive impacts of it. If a med isn't working for you, you could ask your doctor to try out some of the other options? Seems to be pretty individual."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"There have been many advances in ADHD meds over the past few years if what you're on right now doesn't work, there are other options. I have been through a lot of different med combos over the last 7 years and each time something is adjusted I wonder how I functioned before because everything is so amazing now. Talk to your psychiatrist, they can help you, and remember that nothing you are feeling is too small to mention, every piece of information that they have helps."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,Hmm it sounds like a good idea but if I stop even a day I just... it's gonna be a waste of a day 😆 🤣 😂
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"I feel the same way, this was one of the reasons I stated I started doing it.

There were two kids with autism that would come to my pool everyday and I was doing some research so I could understand how they think a bit better. I came across people saying that they need an explanation for things to make sense.

That research helped me discover I have adhd and possibly autism."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Yeah, I forgot to mention that but giving clear/not broad instructions is really important. I really wish my teachers would understand that."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,Yeah it definitely does but I’m trying to introduce a better method than just yelling at the kid to stop.
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"i agree with this. people underestimate the effect of bringing in topics like financial stability towards children, and i say this as someone who’s witnessed a 6 year old stop herself from spending her lunch money on food to help bring in money for her parents"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"What squirrel? Where? Listen, if you’re going to talk about…OH LOOK!!  A SQUIRREL!!!"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Vyvanse allows me to focus and function, but I still feel and ‘act’ like myself. It’s been a really good fit for me."
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,Vyvanse turned me into a zombie. I wanted to talk but I couldn’t bring myself to do it. No eating. Craved energy drinks like I’d die without them. I always find it so interesting how meds impact folks so differently.
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,Yeah it can be that way for me too. But sometimes it’s nice to take a Saturday and goof off. It’s not wasted time if you enjoyed wasting it!
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,Vyvanse made me want to murder everyone i lived with
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Been there! I felt like a zombie as a kid when I first started Ritalin, and I spent a couple years on Dexedrine in highschool with that feeling about talking and eating (just couldn't bear to open my mouth or put anything in it lol)! Almost swore off of meds after struggling with so many of the options. I'm glad that I found one that worked for me - I hope you did too!"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,"Ooh, definitely not a good fit for you!"
4 YO Daughter Says “She Wishes She Had A Different Daddy” Since I Started Dexedrine,Yup. Instant release adderall early in the AM (around 4 - I get up at 430 for the day) then the XR about 830 or so.
First day on Dexedrine felt like perfection. Second day not so much.,"Your body is unique, as are your needs.

Second day not so much.,one thing i realized when taking stimulant meds is to eat a high protein breakfast for best effects. that’s not to say the meds won’t work without a high protein breakfast but you will feel more sucky with the side effects and comedown.
First day on Dexedrine felt like perfection. Second day not so much.,Yeah I think that's what's going on. I searched a bit more thoroughly on Google after posting this and apparently it's because the meds peak more quickly but also leave the bloodstream quicker with no food in the stomach to slow absorption so my side effects make a bit more sense now.

Switched from Adderall to Dexedrine,"I switched to dex from adderall and the first week and a half was rough- falling asleep during the day, exhausted, lots of brain fog. After that, it went away and now dex is working better for me than adderall ever did and without any side effects at all. Wondering if that shitty first week was physical withdrawal from stopping adderall? Either way, glad I stuck it out because dex has been so helpful. One thing to note is that switching to decaf coffee seemed to help also, I read a few posts that coffee/caffeine and Dextroamphetamine don’t play well together."
Switched from Adderall to Dexedrine,"I’ve been taking Teva generic Dexedrine IR for years and over the last year it’s been very hit or miss, month to month, even pill to pill. I’ve been taking the same dose for years prior to noticing an issue starting sometime in late 2021. Since then, I’ve gained weight and felt tired and completely not like myself. There has been no change to my life otherwise - yet I’ve gained a solid 15 pounds and constantly feel unmotivated. I even tried taking double my dose this month because I was so frustrated that I couldn’t get anything done, and still, I barely noticed any effects. I ran out almost 2 weeks early and felt sleepy for two days (I was also on my period so it could have been that), but now it’s been 4 days and I feel normal. No withdrawal like… at all. How could that be? 
Like I said I have been taking the same dose of Dexedrine for years and it always worked really well. Sometimes, too well. I wouldn’t even need to take my full dose each day, and I never ever ran out early. Now it’s barely working and even with doubling my dose I barely notice effects and have been running out way too early, with minimal withdrawal after I run out."
Switched from Adderall to Dexedrine,"You will want to your doc. You may have to try a different stimulant. I ended up on Ritalin, but had to add something for impulsivity, because adderall/concerta controlled that. 

I fall alseep on concerta & adderall. Dexedrine also caused me to mellow out. Great for stress. Hard for keeping motivated, and I fell behind too."
Switched from Adderall to Dexedrine,i had to switch to dexedrine too and it was the absolute worst!!!! it doesn’t help regulate emotions like adderall does so i was having bad adhd rage. i also hatedddddddd going to work all of a sudden and couldn’t get myself to do anything. also with dexedrine you aren’t going to notice the medicine kick in like adderall so it feels like you aren’t on it at all :( i was lucky enough to get an adderall prescription this month and the difference is wild
Switched from Adderall to Dexedrine,Your not alone…I’m having the same issues with it.
Switched from Adderall to Dexedrine,"I feel the same way! I have been taking adderall 30mg twice daily for years and years. For a month or so I have been taking naps as often as I can which was odd to me. I picked up my script today and realized it was switched to Dexedrine 30mg twice a day. So I compared my bottles from last two months and starting last month was the change. So I had to Stratton reading to figure out what this new med was. I was not even told about this change. My patient my chart stills show adderall. So far I don’t like the Dexedrine. I am drained, no energy and my focus is off."
Switched from Adderall to Dexedrine,"I switched from adderall to Dex and I’m feeling the same. Tired, brain fog, and I’ve had some bad headaches. It’s harder for me to communicate my thoughts. My mood was up the first couple days but I feel like it’s tanking. 
I wanted to switch to lessen my anxiety. Fingers crossed these side effects go away. The brain fog is really freaking me out."
Switched from Adderall to Dexedrine,"this is interesting. I actually stopped drinking coffee about 5 months ago but since going on Dexedrin, I’ve had to start again because of how sleepy I’ve been"
Switched from Adderall to Dexedrine,"I'm taking mallinckrodt and it's not bad, it just doesn't feel like the dose is very strong and wears off way too quickly.

15 mg ER feels like less than 10 mg ER Adderall to me."
Switched from Adderall to Dexedrine,yeah there are days where I would take more than my normal dose and felt absolutely nothing. I don’t know about the manufacturer though. how do you see that?
Switched from Adderall to Dexedrine,You may want to have your thyroid checked. These are mostly endocrine issues and that usually ends up being because of the ol'thyroid. A blood panel should be sufficient to tell.
Switched from Adderall to Dexedrine,Around august of 2022 my Teva Generic 30MG IR turned into an absolute placebo pill out of nowhere. Zero effects. Actually made me tired. Lost my job. Depressed. There needs to be a lawsuit.
Switched from Adderall to Dexedrine,yeah I see her friday. I ended up taking one of my left over Adderall today and I’m having a great day now. Dexedrine is just not it for me. I’m also on Lexapro which has already really mellowed me out. With Dexedrine I’m on the verge of sleep constantly.
Switched from Adderall to Dexedrine,dude it sucks so bad for real!! I have like zero happy chemicals in my brain on it. I dread waking up and existing. I see my doctor in one week so fingers crossed I’ll get my adderall back
Switched from Adderall to Dexedrine,I got back on adderall after one month lol
Switched from Adderall to Dexedrine,Omg same! I stay so sleepy on med but everything I read says it’s stronger. I’m just don’t understand.
Switched from Adderall to Dexedrine,Did you check. The dexedrine manufacturers besides the brand name aren't so good. KVT I think their name is is considered to be the worst.
Switched from Adderall to Dexedrine,It says on the pill bottle (mine says ‘Teva USA’).

Dexedrine still available in USA?,I use Dexedrine and in the USA. There were shortages last year but I haven’t had problems getting it the past several months.
Dexedrine still available in USA?,"**TL ; DR: Yes. Extended release is available across 5mg, 10mg, and 15mg generic capsules; brand name Dexedrine Spansule is available in 10mg only. Immediate release tablets are available as brand name Zenzedi and as generic tablets across all marketed strengths: 2.5mg, 5mg, 7.5mg, 10mg, 15mg, 20mg, and 30mg.**

If you’re looking for the controlled/sustained/extended release dextroamphetamine sulfate capsules as the brand name Dexedrine Spansule, the answer is yes; it’s still actively in production and is marketed by Amneal Specialty Pharmaceuticals of NY…although only in the 10mg dose. 

The brand name Dexedrine Spansule is discontinued in both the 5mg dose (circa January 2022) and the 15mg dose (circa September 2023). 

However, the 5mg, 10mg, and 15mg generic extended release dextroamphetamine sulfate capsules are still actively in production and marketed by Mallinckrodt and Actavis Pharmaceuticals. 

Immediate release dextroamphetamine sulfate tablets are available and actively in production across a range of seven dosages (2.5mg, 5mg, 7.5mg, 10mg, 15mg, 20mg, and 30mg). 

All seven strengths are available as brand name Zenzedi, marketed by the Arbor Pharmaceuticals division of Azurity Pharmaceuticals. 

Additionally, all seven strengths are in active production as generic dextroamphetamine sulfate tablets and are marketed as follows: 

- 2.5mg and 7.5mg are marketed by Winder Labs

- 15mg, 20mg and 30mg are marketed by Wilshire Pharmaceuticals (see note) and Winder Labs

- 5mg and 10mg are marketed by Wilshire Pharmaceuticals, Winder Labs, Teva USA, Mallinckrodt, Aurobindo, KVK Tech, and Sunrise Pharmaceuticals.

note: all strengths of generic immediate release dextroamphetamine sulfate tablets that are marketed by Wilshire Pharmaceuticals are exactly the same as the Zenzedi brand name marketed by the Arbor Pharmaceuticals division of Azurity Pharmaceuticals. The only difference is the label on each respective stock bottle. Zenzedi and its Wilshire generic are both manufactured by Mikart, LLC at their facility in Atlanta, GA."
Dexedrine still available in USA?,"I take Dexedrine, but it's the IR version (generic dextroamphetamine), so it's tablets."
Dexedrine still available in USA?,Yeah I have a Dexedrine prescription
Dexedrine still available in USA?,Thanks I’ll try again
Dexedrine still available in USA?,Has it been working well for you?
Dexedrine still available in USA?,"This is so succinct! 

To OP -  Mallinckrodt spansules (ER) were very mild to me. I “liked it” because I was really struggling to accept that I deserve medication (pointlessly self-flagellating). I finally decided to switch to IR (same daily dose, Sunrise manufacturer) and am a happy camper."
Dexedrine still available in USA?,[deleted]
Dexedrine still available in USA?,Are you able to still get the Mallinckrodt pills?
Dexedrine still available in USA?,"I took Adderall for 13 years and had a mixed experience. I feel like it exacerbated my anxiety. Eventually I was taking max dose without much effect. About 4 years ago I switched to the Ritalin line and landed on Concerta for awhile. I was taking max dose and just never had a huge effect, but I was relieved to let go of some other f that physical anxiety that had built up over the decade+ of Adderall. 

A few weeks ago, however, I decided the Concerta just wasn't working well enough and I missed the motivation boost that came with the Adderall, so I went back to the prescriber to ask for Vyvanse-- thinking maybe the long break from the Adderall line would mean my tolerance was back down and then hoping the Vyvance metabolizing mechanism would help cut some of than anxiety. The doctor said I have to try 1 more med before insurance will pay for Vyvanse. 

So for now I'm on Dexedrine and it's been pretty great. I'm still in the adjustment phase as it's only been about 2 weeks, but I feel like I have that mental clarity yet without some of the physical anxiety symptoms that came with Adderall. I found some other comment somewhere on Reddit that basically echoed the same experience. I always assumed the Dexedrine would've been harsher than the Adderall, but that hasn't been the case. My fingers are crossed that it keeps working."
Dexedrine still available in USA?,I switched over to IRs only last Autumn (Sunrise)
Dexedrine still available in USA?,Update ?
Dexedrine still available in USA?,"Thanks for this, I've taken Dextroamphetamine Sulfate before and it worked fine.  It's harder to find, so my provider mentioned that Adderall had an extra 25% of something that makes a person feel the effect in their body a bit more instead of only in their mind... and makes them sweat a bit more but it's fine if drinking enough water.  This all sounded terrible to me especially after reading posts similar to yours.  I think sticking with Dexedrine (which is a brand name.. the drug is Dextroamphetamine Sulfate) is a better option for people who just need their mind to focus.  It's generally thought that stimulants cause anxiety, but I think that isn't true when using Dextroamphetamine."
Dexedrine still available in USA?,Still great! Balanced. Way smoother / fewer side effects than Adderall. For me. Obviously we're all different. But I'm feeling really good about this.
Dexedrine still available in USA?,"Thank you so much for your response! I got diagnosed with ADHD not too long ago (like a year and a half ago), and adderall IR seems to work the best for me so far. I've tried most other medications and considering asking my doc about dexedrine. Adderall IR gives me physical side effects which make me feel more anxious, and it only lasts so long for me. And there's some inconsistencies with the doses for me, but I also have PMDD which is probably why. That all to say, thank you and wish me luck! :)"
Having very different experiences on Dexedrine vs Vyvanse?,"Vyvanse makes me too sleepy. I refuse to touch extended release stimulants either i.e. Adderall XR, Dexedrine spansules. My body chomps though the extended release in the same amount of time as ir except some awful in and out waves past hour 4-5. Instant release is the only thing I react to. 

Dextroamphetamine is the oldest pharmaceutical stimulant, period. It works, period. Just tell your doctor you want back on it. If your doctor isn't open to it they're probably an ass and you should see someone who knows how to and cares about treating ADHD.

I don't know about you, but the last fucking thing I'd be doing at a party is ADHD medicine. If I take too little it's shitty, if I take too much it's shitty. If I take just the right amount, OoOoO, I can get shit done. But I wouldn't classify getting shit done as fun. 

I will warn you that I do think it's also having its own shortages. Someone else can confirm."
Having very different experiences on Dexedrine vs Vyvanse?,Don’t be ashamed of switching back. If you are finding Vyvanse isn’t working for you then it’s not working for you.  ADHD is likely caused by a combination of many different types of genes and each patient likely has a different mixture of genes and will likely respond differently to the various medications. So it’s reasonable to try a couple of different medications.
Having very different experiences on Dexedrine vs Vyvanse?,"Phewie. Yah, extended release stimulants at suboptimal doses makes me exhausted and exacerbates my overstimulation. 

I will maybe have a short window of focus, then heavy eyes, noise is too noisey, light is too bright, I can hear the birds breathing outdoors etc (joke, I can’t but sound is magnified and horrid) 

This happens to me as I dose adjust upwards from the lower doses of extended release. I recently switched to vyvanse, 30mg and I was an overstimulated exhausted wreck. Doubled the dose after four days of this and I finally feel like a human. This was the same with adderall xr, my provider and I got to the point of debating me taking the medication at night because I was so exhausted by it. Thankfully the dose adjustments upwards helped. 

For me the immediate release has the same impact of fatigue if the dose is too low. 

I prioritized the extended release because I just don’t have the capacity to take medication frequently throughout the day, finding a way to have the extended release medication work for me was pivotal."
Having very different experiences on Dexedrine vs Vyvanse?,"Tons of people are reporting that some batches of Vyvanse are bad, with either being not effective suddenly, or causing different side effects.  I recommend getting the lot # from the bottle at the pharmacy every time, and comparing to the reports here.  It could be that it would normally be fine, but you just got a bad bottle. 
My last bottle had such horrible side effects that I had to report it to the FDA; it was definitely different from my bottles that were fine previously.
I finally got a new rx of 20 mg, after trying 30, 40, & 50, and so far it seems to be working again, like my first few good bottles.  I'm now certain that I had several bad ones."
Having very different experiences on Dexedrine vs Vyvanse?,"I spent 2 weeks crying on Vyvanse. My Dr is having my try Dexedrine, just waiting for the pharmacy to get it in."

Having very different experiences on Dexedrine vs Vyvanse?,I’ve never like vyvanse
Having very different experiences on Dexedrine vs Vyvanse?,"I know this was posted a while ago but wanted to share a similar experience I've had. Dexedrine worked amazingly well for me, just made me a bit shaky and I'm a designer so that was a bit of an issue, so I was switched to Vyvanse. Like you, told it was essentially the same thing.

I actually did feel less jittery from it, but the other positive effects of the medication seemed to be diminished as well. I feel like with Vyvanse I could think of the tasks I wanted to complete but while in the process of working on one my mind would become fixated on a different task and I would feel compelled to switch. Whereas with Dex I'm able to begin a task and remain very focused until I complete it. I also found that my outcome with dexedrine is much more consistent whereas some batches of Vyvanse feel almost completely ineffective and others are really strong. I also have depression/anxiety and my symptoms seemed to gradually worsen the longer I was on vyvanse vs. dexedrine. Not sure if this is because of Vyvanse but it coincided with that time, I also frequently experienced moments where my mind just went completely blank. Usually it wasn't too problematic, but it happened a few times during presentations and also a job interview, which was very annoying. I would be following a train of thought clearly and suddenly I couldn't even remember what I was talking about mid-sentence.

Your psych & other doctors I think are going off the knowledge that because they are technically the same chemical compound they treat symptoms identically, (just with different absorptions and durations of action) but there is a lot that we don't know about the brain and while these medications are intended to produce x result, there are definitely other variables that likely effect the experience that each individual has. I really felt that I was on an entirely different drug when I switched, and if the goal is to allow ppl to overcome their symptoms of adhd, the most important thing is doing what works best for you personally. That's why I think sharing & validating our experiences with each other is really important.

Ofc doctors are skeptical about anything surrounding stimulants because they are so frequently abused, but that doesn't discount those of us who actually rely on these substances to help us lead normal, successful lives. For me these medications completely transformed my life in such a positive way. 

It sucks feeling judged esp. in a medical setting, but at the end of the day we are the ones who are living with the outcomes everyday and we have to advocate for our own best interest. I also find that looking presentable/wearing nice clothes instead of sweats, brushing my hair, etc. and being objective and clear about my experience/ changes really improves my overall experience with doctors. It's unfortunate, but if they perceive you as someone who really is using it with positive intentions, they are more likely to listen to your experience and work with you to find the best treatment."
Having very different experiences on Dexedrine vs Vyvanse?,"Huh, so interesting - so you react the opposite way to me, in that vyvanse makes you sleepy rather than giving you the 'I've had too much coffee' jitters. I guess it just goes to show how individual meds are. My ADHD best friend found that dex made her face twitch, but loves long acting ritalin (not sure what it's actually called).

I also get the unpleasant waves on vyvanse, too. Just when I think it's calming down I get a bunch of nervous energy crashing through my nervous system. 

And thanks. I really appreciate the reassurance that I'm not doing anything wrong. I think my psychiatrist will be ok when I tell him, he seemed baffled but not unsympathetic. I suspect it's mostly internalised stigma. Shortly after I was diagnosed, a friend found my Dex (I left it at her house) and decided to tell me how great it was when she took 6-7 tablets of it so she could party all night at a music festival. And also at my law school, I knew students who would buy dex and use it to study through the night. So I guess I've been super worried of coming across that way.

Oddly enough, one of the law school kids tried to gift me Dex to help me through my final exams. I refused because... I don't do drugs. I was diagnosed 12 years later 🤪"
Having very different experiences on Dexedrine vs Vyvanse?,"Yeah after years on concerta, vyvanse, adderall xr and eventually Dexedrine XR  I realized that even if the smoothest amphetamine medicine that is Dexedrine still is too unpredictable and keep me up too long, plus has an extended coke down/crash for me, IR’s ftw yo!"
Having very different experiences on Dexedrine vs Vyvanse?,"Thank you very much for this comment. I guess that's right, there's still heaps we don't know about ADHD so it makes sense it doesn't always respond to treatment in the way we think it 'should'. And that we can't always explain why. Antidepressants are the same I suppose.

It's really not working for me. I've taken it for about a month now and it still sucks. So I'll go back and have a conversation with my doctor about that."
Having very different experiences on Dexedrine vs Vyvanse?,"K this is really good to know as in the last two months suddenly vyvanse is giving me horrid anxiety. I’m on 70mg and 10mg dexedrine ir in the afternoon cause vyvanse only is effectbuntil noon for me. I have started to hate hate hate it.

Over Christmas I decided to just try taking my Dexedrine and holy shit life changer. 

Sucks that you have to dose every couple of hours but it really was a total different reality.
So now I’m on Dexedrine xr and Dexedrine ir in the afternoon. I find the spansule isn’t the same though."
Having very different experiences on Dexedrine vs Vyvanse?,[deleted]
Having very different experiences on Dexedrine vs Vyvanse?,"Look into the bad batches of Vyvanse that people are reporting.  I also cried unreasonably on my last bottle, so I know it was bad b/c that never happened before.  If that was your first bottle and only experience, you wouldn't know any better."
Having very different experiences on Dexedrine vs Vyvanse?,"Yeah, break through the stigma. It doesn't apply to us."
Having very different experiences on Dexedrine vs Vyvanse?,"Yes, I have seen it apply to Elvanse, and the main lot numbers were starting with 31 & 32 as bad, and 52 as being good.  There's probably others, but most people don't ask for the numbers when getting their rx filled, and the pharmacy doesn't keep or record them."
Having very different experiences on Dexedrine vs Vyvanse?,"That wasn't my only experience, I was on it several months ago as well. My mom was also on it years ago and she had the same issue I did. Unfortunately it's just not the right med for me."

What’s Dexedrine ir like?,"Dexedrine IR is the shiz! But seriously, it's been a lifesaver for my ADHD. Definitely talk to your doctor about switching if you're having issues with Vyvanse. And good luck scheduling those pills, it's like trying to wrangle cats on speed... #ADHDLife"
What’s Dexedrine ir like?,"I get three hours out of it, followed by a mild crash that lasts 30-45 minutes. Then for several hours after it has a strange effect whereby I'm still more motivated and clear-headed then if I had never taken anything. A bit of coffee or green tea helps extend that. I'm very sensitive to meds. Only 2.5 mg at a time is more than enough. I take anywhere from one to three doses a day. Some days I don't take any. Depends what I'm doing. I never take it after 2 pm.

I was on Vyvanse a few years ago and had to stop because I was missing too much sleep. I like Dex way better because I can control how much is in my system according to what's required of me for the day. The crashes aren't near are bad or as long either."
What’s Dexedrine ir like?,I hate it
What’s Dexedrine ir like?,"Thank you for all the info! My problem is quite similar, I get the crash but I can still kinda stay focused but I just kinda become a shell :( when u say u get the crash, but continue being able to focus, is this just from one ir? If you take another does the crashy feeling go away? Im just trying to get rid of that feeling because my adhd meds seem to really help my social anxiety, but when they start wearing off I get an opposite effect where socializing becomes even more difficult then when I don’t take anything. Hope that makes sense lol!"
What’s Dexedrine ir like?,I have social anxiety during the crash as well. If I keep taking a dose every three hours there is no crash until after the last dose for the day. I'm self employed and work alone on my own land so I have no need to be very social much of the time anyway.

"Adderall, Dexedrine, Strattera, Foquest, Concerta. Now what?",The answer for me is one of those stimulants (adderall dexedrine vyvanse all work for me) plus 2mg guanfacine twice daily as well. It seems to smooth out the stimulant experience for me and gets rid of the worst side effects. Perhaps the combo is worth exploring for you as well
"Adderall, Dexedrine, Strattera, Foquest, Concerta. Now what?",I really like vyvanse! There are also a lot of ways to help with ADHD struggles that isn’t medication. I have a lot of ADHD friends who are both on and off meds
"Adderall, Dexedrine, Strattera, Foquest, Concerta. Now what?","Do you also get periods of very high mood? If so, a mood stabilizer might help more than an antidepressant."
"Adderall, Dexedrine, Strattera, Foquest, Concerta. Now what?","Have you tried the IR (instant release) amphetamine? I ask because I started with the name brand Adderall that only comes in ER (extended release) form, and hated it. It took a couple years, but working with my doctor I found that taking IR is the answer, because I can control what I'm taking each day. If I'm sleep deprived, I'll skip my last dose. If I'm not working, I might take 1/2 in the morning instead of a full. On the weekends I cut back a little to help with tolerance. It's perfect, and maybe not for everyone but it's been life changing for me. 

I also tried Strattera and hated it. And it made me so physically sick to my stomach and headaches. 

Another recommendation - have you tried behavioral therapy? This can be a great addition, because many of us likely missed learning how to organize and put systems in place ironically because we weren't organized or had systems in place when others were learning these things. Or, maybe parents had ADHD and organization didn't exist. In any case, behavioral therapy really really helps."
"Adderall, Dexedrine, Strattera, Foquest, Concerta. Now what?","Sometimes it’s a matter of the right combination of medications at the right dosages. 

I would write down the effects - favorable and unfavorable - of each medication. Then do some research and see if they’re at least giving you the effects they’re supposed to. 

Let’s say methylphenidate gives you the motivation boost it’s supposed to. Ok, then you know its mechanism works - it may just be a question of finding a formulation that minimizes side effects. If the side effects are unavoidable, can you pinpoint which neurotransmitter is being impacted? Is there another med you can add that might smooth out the roller coaster? 

I also recommend tracking how long you were on the meds for and seeing if you hit the target titration period. Strattera, for instance, can take up to four weeks to even out.

Lastly, I recommend looking into non-stimulants like Guanfacine and clonidine and see if they address any of the ancillary symptoms. Guanfacine can touch emotional regulation in a way that other meds can’t. 

Ok one more thing: diet and lifestyle impacts a lot. Factor that in as well when you’re tracking mood.

It takes some trial and error but I’d wager most of us end up on a combo after some time.

Worth noting that many ppl find their depression goes away with adhd medication. I know it’s tricky but it may be worth starting with the adhd meds as a base and then adding an antidepressant if needed.

I’m not a doctor. I’m on Strattera and guanfacine atm."
"Adderall, Dexedrine, Strattera, Foquest, Concerta. Now what?","I love Jornay. It’s a slow-release AND delayed-release methylphenidate. I take it at night and it’s working when I wake up in the morning. I don’t notice side effects that I got on Concerta or Adderall and once I found the right dose, it helped my general mood a lot. 

No matter how early I took my meds before, they never seemed to kick in before mid-day. That’s sometimes called “morning failure” and was what Jornay was developed to address, but for me it’s also just better overall. Based on how you describe your mornings, I think it might help. 

There’s no generic yet, so a couple of times when I’ve switched pharmacies I’ve had to explain to the pharmacist that it’s not just another form of slow release, so I won’t take the generic Concerta they’re trying to give me."
"Adderall, Dexedrine, Strattera, Foquest, Concerta. Now what?","I went through a similar process (including many sleepless nights trying the adderall class), but finally found my answer when I switched to the Ritalin class. Sorry to hear this wasn’t the case for you - I can only imagine how hopeless it feels.

Through the process I discovered I’m unusually sensitive to stimulants, so I only take 15mg/day of instant release Ritalin (10mg morning, 5mg afternoon). I also take a small dose of Seroquil if I can’t sleep and/or feel anxious (a sleep aid, but also a mood stabilizer). 

I hope you find your answer soon - hang in there."
"Adderall, Dexedrine, Strattera, Foquest, Concerta. Now what?","Finding an Executive Function/ADHD coach was a big help for me - not as a replacement for medication, but as additional support. 

This still has not been well studied, but one acquaintance told me Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) helped him reduce his stimulant dosage. I'm not aware of any clear studies which have been published on this."
"Adderall, Dexedrine, Strattera, Foquest, Concerta. Now what?","I don’t know how long you’re trying each for but it should be noted that it takes some time to adjust to any of these, including and especially the amphetamines. For the first month I was on them I was regularly up until 1:30 (I have to wake up at 6) but it leveled off to the point where I’m normally out close to midnight."
"Adderall, Dexedrine, Strattera, Foquest, Concerta. Now what?","Same boat. Stattera stole my sense of safety. My doc suspects that my issues come from sleep apnea. The solution for that isn't meds, it's a CPAP machine."
"Adderall, Dexedrine, Strattera, Foquest, Concerta. Now what?",Try and get a second opinion on your adhd diagnosis - what if you were misdiagnosed?
"Adderall, Dexedrine, Strattera, Foquest, Concerta. Now what?",Which anti depressant and any side effects from it?
"Adderall, Dexedrine, Strattera, Foquest, Concerta. Now what?",That's a good call. Thanks for the ideas!
"Adderall, Dexedrine, Strattera, Foquest, Concerta. Now what?","The guanfacine does the same for my asd kiddo with his adhd meds as well. For me, my stimulant calms my mind down from being SO LOUD and so non stop that I can pass out anywhere and anytime now, haha."
"Adderall, Dexedrine, Strattera, Foquest, Concerta. Now what?","Hmm I wouldn't say I get periods of high mood, but this a good avenue to explore. Thanks!"
"Adderall, Dexedrine, Strattera, Foquest, Concerta. Now what?","That's a really good idea. I'm going to look into the fast acting ones.  I've done traditional therapy tons, but because the diagnosis is relatively new, I haven't done therapy through the lens of ADHD, and that would likely help focus my issues more. Thanks for the recommendation!"
"Adderall, Dexedrine, Strattera, Foquest, Concerta. Now what?","Thanks for the insight! I was on each for a pretty solid amount of time, but I definitely didn't log my side effects, just recalled them when I went to see the psychiatrist. I'm sure that would be useful. So far the net effect on my depression is positive, but it makes the sad points extra unenjoyable."
"Adderall, Dexedrine, Strattera, Foquest, Concerta. Now what?",This is something worth looking into! Thanks for the recommendation ◡̈
"Adderall, Dexedrine, Strattera, Foquest, Concerta. Now what?","Jornay is amazing! After trying every methylphenidate formulation and other stimulants over the years, it has been a game changer! Like you, I had to find the right dose. I used to have morning over stimulation and subsequent afternoon crash, which I used a booster to get through the day, but now I just feel normal ALL DAY! 
I was the first patient my doctor prescribed it to, so it took some convincing on my part. I suspect he has prescribed it to others after hearing me sing its praises."
"Adderall, Dexedrine, Strattera, Foquest, Concerta. Now what?","That's some good insight, and I think it might be worth looking into the fast acting ones, so I can manage the dose more. I know it's a process of trial and error, but gosh it is exhausting. Thanks for the support!"
"Adderall, Dexedrine, Strattera, Foquest, Concerta. Now what?","I think you're right about finding a coach! I could certainly use some more strategies, and accountability. I'll look into TMS. Thanks for the insight!"
"Adderall, Dexedrine, Strattera, Foquest, Concerta. Now what?","I was on amphetamines for about 4 months, and really had a hard time sleeping, but it could certainly be all about the dose."
"Adderall, Dexedrine, Strattera, Foquest, Concerta. Now what?","I'm working on the second opinion, at least to get more insight. I was diagnosed by my psychiatrist, but he didn't give me a proper assessment, and I'm navigating it mostly solo. Thanks!"
"Adderall, Dexedrine, Strattera, Foquest, Concerta. Now what?","I'm taking Trintellix. I don't seem to get any side effects, but also, I don't know if it works at all haha. I should do more investigating into that."
"Adderall, Dexedrine, Strattera, Foquest, Concerta. Now what?","For sure. 

Another thing I’d be curious about is the effect over time of being medicated on your depressive symptoms. They won’t go away overnight but they may transform as medication supports other aspects of your life like getting a routine down, feeling more in control and competent, making lifestyle changes, etc.

I spent about ten years on antidepressants before starting adhd meds and one thing I noticed after starting adhd meds was that initially, there were intense waves of medication-related down mood - like s____ ideation down! - and over time they lessened and shortened. It felt like I leveled up every four months. This is Strattera - I’m sure it looks different on amphetamines. 

My depression, which used to be a constant companion, is now at the point where I know if I’m feeling it, it’s because of a lifestyle imbalance or something I ate. Im three years into treatment and starting to see breaks in the cloud cover - moments where i think to myself, “Omg, I could accomplish this thing in my life and I’m excited about it” vs “We got through another day” - thriving vs surviving.

With that said, i also do weekly CIMBS therapy, which has been immensely transformative in conjunction w everything else. Dietary changes were major as well since adhd often comes with histamine intolerance, low iron, etc.

All to say, it may take time to reap the full benefits of being medicated bc it’s just one piece of the puzzle.

I got a good piece of advice from one of my doctors when I was titrating up and feeling flat and depressed: give yourself time to adjust to the new normal of being medicated."
"Adderall, Dexedrine, Strattera, Foquest, Concerta. Now what?","No side effects is great. For how long? It is different for everyone, but I about 2.5 months in and slowly started to feel better.

"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","Hey man, I got diagnosed at 26. Nearly 27 now and I'm still not stable on the medication, but let me tell you this : ADHD builds a caged fire inside of you. All the dreams you could never chase, the untold number of ideas you could never bring to life, the school and work aspirations you always knew you were capable of but for some reason just couldn't bring to fruition, the work you wanted to put in but couldn't, the years of built up shame from thinking maybe you were just lazy despite knowing you work harder than everybody else - all of that hasn't been let out, but it hasn't gone anywhere. It's all piled up in there, locked in a sophisticated ADHD cage, burning you like a fucking sun. You can probably feel it in your solar plexus. I know I could. And you know that too, because that's exactly why you wrote down this paragraph for a group of strangers to read.

Do you know what happens when you finally unlock that cage? You will explode with motivation and willpower to catch up on everything you missed out and more. All that pent up emotion is just going to act as a propelling force pushing you harder than ever to accomplish everything you ever wanted. And then, without the cage, you will actually, for the first time in your life, be able to do anything you set your mind to.

And the best part of it all is, pretty much nobody else around you will have that power to exploit. It's yours and yours only. You've played a quarter of your life in Very Hard mode and you just switched that shit to Easy. Everyone else has been playing on easy all along. Who do you think the better player is going to be?

Don't lose hope. I found my key in dextroamphetamine. 7 months later I'm still not 100% there with finding exactly the drug/dose that works 100%, but I'm getting there, and my life has been changed already. You will find yours. Go get treatment. NOW. At ANY cost. no matter what it takes. And when you do, try every single possible thing there is until you find something that works for you. Pour all your soul into this single task.  This might be the difference between life and a slow and miserable death. I'm sure you can do it, because you are me a year ago, and I did. And what a year it has been."

I feel what you feel, *deeply*.

I'm 37 this year and I still don't know wtf I'm doing. I wish I had answers and something to help guide you but all I can give is my sympathy. Don't feel alone, though! I'm right there with you, lost, and sometimes it REALLY stresses me out.

But sometimes I realize that I just have to be ok with how things are,... how *I* am.

Honestly,... I feel like that's a shitty answer but it's the best I got so far.

Godspeed and I wish you well."
"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","It’s worth thinking about societies expectations and how you are comparing yourself to others. Why you feel like you have to do certain things. It has set my expectations in a realistic way that are relevant & make sense for me, not for how My life progress appears to others, you still have just over two of your lifetimes approximately to live. You have a long time to figure things out. 

One aspect for example, some cultures its expected to live at home until you’re 30 with three other generations of family that’s the norm of family relations. 

Another aspect is how society expects us to “grow up” and “act like adults” making it a social crime to be seen to be having fun in ways that make you happy. Dancing is probably a good example to illustrate the idea. 

It’s just something to think about."
"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","I had the EXACT same realization when I was 25. Since 25 I've...graduated with my Master's, taught at university for 3 years, run a marathon and two halves after losing 60 pounds, been alcohol-free for 5 years, hiked Machu Picchu, and now have an incredibly fulfilling career where I make six-figures plus annually. 

I'm not saying any of that to show off (I usually don't talk about it) but I share it because at 25, I was overweight + depressed. I didn't, heck, couldn't, get out of bed until 1 or 2pm most days. I had no direction, no purpose. No goals, no..nothing. I thought I was complete and total failure.

I spent my early 20s drinking and partying (sure, looking back now, they were fun... but I hadn't...done anything). I had nothing to show for it. By the time I hit 25, I was done. Toast. Just miserable. 

But things got better over time. 

It hasn't been easy (grad school without meds was a nightmare). It took a few years but I got my shit together over time... starting with the decision that I would do things differently. I didn't get diagnosed until about 16 months ago and I've reached a new level of happiness. Looking back...I never thought I'd be where I am now. 

All of that to say - you're young. You have so much time. You can make this moment the moment that everything changed. You can look back in a few years and be proud that you made the decision to change. You can be proud of who you are. 

The support systems exist. Seek treatment. Be patient...but keep moving forward."
"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","I never managed to figure out what I really wanted to do with life. So when I was 30 I asked myself if there was something I might be able to do while trying to figure things out. I asked myself what I considered meaningful and important, then what talents I had and if there was any interests that had persisted through my life. 

I think healthcare is important, but I'm bad with people so I couldn't become a nurse or something like that. But I'm good with computers, so for the past 15 years I've been working on programming software for hospitals and similar. I help those who help, so contribute to something important beyond myself. And when things have been tough the knowledge that I help those with important jobs have helped me to keep going.

So what helped me was to change the question from what do I want, to what would make my life meaningful. It may seem like a tiny thing, but for me that shift in focus made all the difference."
"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","I was right there with you, my dude. It really fucking sucks.


Are you in therapy? If not, please get a therapist asap. Address these concerns. Therapy, CBT, meds -- they're not going to magically make you normal, but they can help a lot.


If I can offer a hopeful anecdote... I also felt like this and still feel it sometimes. I was stuck in a dead end job, had a shitty apartment, dropped out of college, and watched all the people from my high school going to grad school, buying houses, having beautiful weddings and kids etc. Meanwhile I felt like I wasted my life. One year, ONE FREAKING YEAR of therapy changed so much for me. I started almost exactly a year ago at 28. I feel so much better about approaching my 30s than I felt about my 20s.



All this to say OP, you're still young. Your life is not over at 25. Social media and societal pressure sure as hell make us feel like our 20s are the peak of our lives, but they don't have to be. Feel free to DM if you ever need to talk/vent. I know what you're feeling is overwhelming. It fucking blows. Just know that you are not a failure, and your future is not hopeless. It's okay to feel what you're feeling, and it's okay to ask for help. 💜"

"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","It took me until 29 to realize it was time to tackle my undiagnosed ADHD. I'll be turning 31 in 5 months, I've been prescribed Adderall and I got therapy. The medication, in my own opinion, is what made the difference in my life. 

The trick is that after 1 year of medication I'm fully realizing this is a life long thing. I won't ever get ""better"" I'll just manage to cope with it better. I still feel like a lost wanderer, as I have always felt and its how I continue to feel. The medication and mindful strategies help fit into a day to day routine that is expected of me but even still that's not what happiness means to me. It helps me tame the side of me that offers no value to anyone else.  

I am a separated parent. My relationship had many challenges but in hindsight my untreated ADHD was likely the cause for my inability to recognize a solution. I was 22 when my daughter was born, I was a single father at 25. I dropped out of college 3 times and accumulated a good chunk of pointless student debt. I hate myself for that but it wasn't really my fault. I was the square peg that was being forced into a round hole. I did what everyone else was doing, because I was supposed to. It's what I was told to do. I was told to just carry on. 

I've never wanted anything in life. In school my peers had ambitions. They were certain of themselves in a way I didn't understand. I like video games, so I wanted to make video games. That's what I told the adults to satisfy their question. ""I don't know"" wasn't going satisfy the guidance councilor so they could ""help"" me decide what classes to take at 14 years old so I could ""achieve my dreams"" one day. The closer I got to adulthood the more I realized I didn't want any of it. The more I realized I never had any dreams at all. I just wanted to exist and find peace inside myself. 

My diagnosis granted me the privilege of being prescribed Adderall and to avoid the high cost of therapy without my doctors referral. Before that I had found a job that is ultimately pointless but provides me with the necessary funds to maintain a comfortable, but humble life. It's a dead end and that destroys my soul, but it has an employer matched pension, extended health insurance benefits, stock options, rrsp and tax free savings accounts that are matched at 33%. I don't want any of this, but I know others don't have anything close to it and I am thankful. But I still feel lost. I'm just doing what I'm told to do. 

I've begun to truly tear down who and what I am. It's been incredibly painful. I think part of ADHD is the unrelenting want for more. The unending ""what if?"", or ""Is this it?"". I think it lies to us, that it tells us we can be anything from it's disconnected place inside us. It's a disability that compares us to everyone else all of the time and wonders why we're not all of them, all at once. 

This isn't to say that I haven't found improvement in my life. I've had to examine what my improvement is for myself, without comparison to anyone else. I've had to find a way to see me through my own eyes and not as a reflection in someone else's. I've had to accept that I won't likely learn to code just because I ""want"" to. I've had to accept that I can't be anything I want to be. I can only be what I am and I have to be ok with that."

Think about basics: what tasks you find most joy in, what you seem to excel at, what skills you have that others don't. Try to direct all that towards your next step. Don't despair when your ADHD gets in the way. Follow through with it and believe in yourself and your gut instinct. You were led to your choice, not just because you were interested, but because you ARE capable.

Another thing: people always say think about the big picture but that always felt daunting and impossible to me. I'm focusing on smaller goals so I don't get overwhelmed.

"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","Take it from someone who's been through exactly what you're describing that the best thing you can do for yourself is to go get a psychiatrist so they can evaluate you and prescribe some medication to help, and a regular therapist to help you sort out what's going on in that awesome wonderful very undervalued gift those of us with ADD/ADHD have - a brain that can operate at warp speeds and constantly analyze multiple things at once.

""I have so many thoughts rushing through my head 24/7 that it is impossible to pinpoint anything, impossible to isolate what I actually want."".... man I know EXACTLY what you're talking about. I think the number one goal you need right now is exactly that - figure out what you need to be able to slow your thoughts a bit so you can get a breath. Having your brain run that fast for days on end is exhausting!! The two things I use are medication for my ADD (the lowest dose I can take that helps me just enough) and normal mindfulness meditation. The meds will help to slow your neurotransmitters down, and the meditation will help to slow you down even more so that you aren't forced to follow every single stray thought down the rabbit hole of eternal distraction.

I hear you on the despair very much as well. It's a really hopeless, shitty, scary place to be trapped (I don't know how many times I've told myself in anger ""Why can't you just do the NORMAL THINGS everyone else can do?) and it can be scary.

But trust me you are way ahead of the curve (and pretty self aware as well) if you have as good a grasp on identifying the problem this early. I wish you the best of luck and keep posting here... I'm new myself but I already get so much out of participating here. There's a lot to be said for people who just ""get"" you right away."

Something I figured out though is stop looking at the mountain, just start climbing, one foot in front of the other.
Things like careers, moving out from home, relationships are all big big things that don't just happen overnight for anyone, ADHD or not. So they look like mountains, like they're unachievable and overwhelming, break them down as small as they will go. 
Want to move out from home -> have to save money for it, start off putting a tiny amount away, 5 bucks even, once you hit that target, make another small one, make a goal of reading an article about renting for the first time, make a goal of just having a look at a few houses online, keep tipping away at saving bit by bit, make a goal of making a list of things you'd like in a house, complete these goals slowly but surely and give yourself your dues when you do. 
Celebrate your small achievements as much as your big ones. 
Breaking the target down as small as it can go and completing one thing at a time will build your confidence up and bring you closer and closer to the end goal. Before you know it you'll be halfway up that mountain shocked at how far you've come, just gotta start climbing ❤️"

"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness"," I had worked in the restaurant industry for most of my life until I recognized that I was capable of more rewarding and higher paying work. I was 30 years old when transitioned into a career in the insurance industry. If my first year, I doubled my restaurant industry salary, in my second year, I tripled my restaurant industry salary and State Farm offered me my own agency. 

I was diagnosed with autism recently but I had recognized that I had those traits too. 

I chose the insurance industry for a reason though. Since I am not college educated, it limited my job prospects and fortunately, in the United States, insurance representatives can easily make six figures selling car, home, and life insurance. I was interested in personal finance (and economics) and I had a restaurant colleague who left the industry and worked as a financial planner.  I met with him and was incredibly underwhelmed with what he did -- it was just an opportunity to sell life insurance products under the guise of it being financial planning and helping to save money. There was little consideration to suitability and obviously, if financial planning and saving money was the primary goal, their financial planning advice was not a good model. 

That was the only exposure I had to the financial planning world and it was a huge turn off. The finance industry has a very broey atmosphere that I did not want to be a part of. I felt that the boring reputation of the insurance industry was particularly attractive due to my ADHD and autism (atmospheres like that help keep me grounded). The average age of an insurance agent is also something like, 58, which to me, meant that many people in the industry probably weren't leveraging data as well as they could be or connecting with millennials. Clearly, the $700 or so investment it cost to get pre-licensed and then licensed paid off and I enjoy working in the insurance industry. 

Being in a workplace where you feel valued is incredibly important and helped give me the self-esteem that I needed to see a psychiatrist and get meds for my ADHD. It felt like I was cheating once I was on meds because I was finally able to see what I was capable of when I was in a supportive environment, felt good about myself, and earning money. We were able to completely get out of debt, we purchased a home, I was in the best physical health of my life, and I began to write and record music more frequently. 

The best advice I can give is to figure out what works for you! I'm autistic and I have ADHD and it feels like everyone tries to push computer science on me as if it would be something that I would automatically be good at. I took a programming class in high school and I think other than Spanish, it was my worst-performing class. I briefly worked in a technology role in the restaurant industry and interviewed outside of the company for a tech sales role and wasn't hired, and it probably was for the best. For some people, computer science is a great fit for autistic people and people with ADHD. Only you know what works best for you. 

&#x200B;

If you're unable to even recognize what works best for you and feel completely lost, I would suggest that based off what you described, seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist might be beneficial."

I spent five years in what's usually a two year grad program doing absolutely nothing. They kick you out after 5 years if you aren't done yet.

"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","At least you’re not 38 which is when i was diagnosed. Get the help you need. Be kind to yourself. I had a similar experience and floundered through school for 7+ years. 3-4 majors and 3-4 universities before by dumb luck I found something that suited my interests and was achievable with my (unknown at the time) disability. The field happens to have a decent job market. However the career requires a lot of technical writing, and has poorly defined deadlines which don’t conform to my adhd. I’ve had performance issues at every job I’ve had and switched employers/jobs almost as much as I switched universities. I’m getting treatment, therapy, and medication. And I’m looking for a new job ;). I don’t think my symptoms are as severe as a lot of folks, but the anxiety, depression, and trauma of that cycle is real. I hate it. 

I would take a break from school and do a deep dive into your strengths and weaknesses if you can. College is expensive and not necessarily a good return on investment. I did this, worked a job that wasn’t bad for my adhd, but wasn’t an area I wanted to make a career out of. 

Upon reflection one of my biggest regrets wasn’t dropping classes or taking classes that didn’t benefit me, it was the extra 10s of thousands of debt I incurred while spinning my wheels trying to figure out college.

 Research jobs that have tasks that maximize your strengths. I like task based work that’s done at the end of the day or Maybe week. I hate writing, and have always struggled with it (going back to grade school). Longer, Drawn out deadlines just mean I’ll put it off until it’s near. Which causes me stress and anxiety and requires that I hyper focus to push a project out. In my current job I’m expected to work and stay on task independently, but usually end up not meeting clients’ expected timeframes, and rushing once they start complaining. I do well with more supervision and even micro-management within reason. 

If I had to do it over, I would have chosen something different. I also struggle with planning anything that isn’t immediate. I don’t even plan dinner. Nor vacation or weekend plans a lot of the time. Cooking is immensely frustrating; by the time the food is ready I’d have rather eaten a peanut butter sandwich, which tastes better, is immediate and has virtually no clean up (not healthy though).

You might find a trade or skill that doesn’t require college degree. And you might find a job that suits you, but requires a degree program that doesn’t. Ask a lot of questions both of your professors and people that actually do the job to gain as much perspective as you can. Keep in mind some college professors have mostly worked in academia and don’t have a great grasp on the ‘real world’ applications of their area of expertise. For a while in college I thought I would go into advanced degrees and academia because that was my only exposure to the subjects I was studying. See if you can do a ride along for a day with a working professional."

"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","I ...

And here I am again with 27 and my brother being 35 (iirc). And let me tell you; we have no (real) job, are still poor, have no real goals, ambitions and finally figured out ADHD is prolly the culprit and that I was actually diagnosed with 10. It's awful. I always wonder and wondered why my life passed me by so quicky as if one year is actually just 4 months or smth, but yes, I guess it is indeed the time blindness doing this. And I hate it.

I know people say life goes by faster due to lack of new experience the older we get, but it already started doing by extremely fast rather early on. No friends to go out with, no stuff to explore and experience, just sitting at home in front of the PC and not even working on learning new languages, translating or doing anything anymore really. And the pandemic just made it worse, ugh. Meds, therapy and courses/connection are my only hope atm.

I have bad news, friend, because of ADHD, you never will. However, getting **okay** with that is a skill you can develop.

> I just never feel calm and safe

Yeah, that's life in your 20's. Like, people glorify it as a period of youthful adulthood, but it's this slog of uncertainty and unreasonable expectations.

ADHD amplifies this, and you could feel this way somewhat even if you had completed college and had a nice job that pays well. I know from personal experience. On the other side of uncertainty is a feeling of safety, but you need to build it yourself :-( .

> How could I have goals?

You wanted to go to school at one point, but when you stopped wanting it it stopped happening. That's how ADHD works. If you want it, you feel like obtaining it is worth a world of effort, but if you don't want it, a world of effort won't make you work toward it. This is why ADHD-friendly project planning is so difficult and yet so important. One thing that can help is an accountability buddy. Someone who will hold your feet to the fire and get on your case if you're wavering. But I digress.

Therapy and medication might help you to focus your thoughts better, and project planning can help you develop goals. There's an all-or-nothing sentiment that comes with ADHD that makes life goals harder to develop (see my first point). If you can, going back to school could be a fixed goal for a time, but at a certain point you'll need to develop goals on your own.

My philosophy on creating goals is pretty off-topic so I'll put it in a response to this post."

I get it, looking back now. seems like the sum total. but tomorrow adds another day.. and so on. 

Honestly, and I'm saying this, not as a brag, but to try and help.. 

When I was 25, I had like fuck all in my account and a new baby. 
Having a baby bought up a lot of shit to do with my adoption/neglect and it broke me. I didn't work for several years. 
I did the gauntlet of depression meds (I knew about my ADHD, but tbh, since leaving school... that kinda just got put in a box, it was 20 years ago, we didn't give much creedence to mental health!)

Oh, fat too, I was a right fat prick. like 200kg. today, I'm 36, I'm about to cycle my daughter to school for some fresh air, then sit down and take some meetings where I am an associate producer/games designer making video games, from home, in my own little ADHD cave filled with things to help ME. and finding what I enjoy and excel at has also magically helped the bank balance! :D 

PLEASE do not take this as humble bragging, it is more to explain the polar opposites and how things can look bleak with a 'how does it ever get better'... it does. but you can't give up. get broken, beaten whatever happens, but hold onto that thread. things will get better.

I think even if you didn’t go to or graduate college, or if you’re still working on your degree, the same # of years still applies, plus a couple years for COVID. So you’d still short like… 8 years until it starts to “count”. Hope that’s as comforting for you as it is for me. :)"

Then bursts of rage when I'm confronted with these things and cannot make heads or tails of it. Automatic NOs to life because I can't bear to disappoint, and cannot sustain.  
  
sorry bud this doesn't help. thanks for sharing your feelings. get medication. Adderall might have kept you up late but that doesn't mean you should give up on it or another form of it. for many of us, it's either medication or a miracle. Therapy would also be a great idea for you."

Seriously, as much as this feeling sucks, it's part of the human condition. My mid to late 20's was a time of comparing myself to my peers; who has what job; they live where?; etc. It was frustrating. I tried doing what I liked because there are too many life experiences to attempt to experience otherwise. 
I had my mid-life crisis when I was 25. It lasted for like 10 years (this was actually depression, anxiety, and adhd but whatever). Now I'm pushing 50 and I try to enjoy today. 
The rushing thoughts need therapy or meds (both?). When I was younger (and not medicated) I was a voracious reader...sci-fi and myths; comics. This kept my thought at bay. When I wasn't reading I was listening to music for the same reason.

I ended up giving up on school, prioritizing work experience instead.

What was a scattered resume of seemingly incongruous jobs became a well-rounded background that plays to my broad knowledge base (even if it's shallower than spilled water in places) and a more varied lived experience that helps me connect to and manage my staff better.

What was dread about always being a step behind in social intelligence (and let's face it, status) became closer, more unbreakable relationships with the people who could bear with me.

Try to see this not as losing time, but gaining it.

Like, I had finally hyper focused for long enough to cross a threshold of understanding and now, I was ready to do it all at once.

The time you believe you’re wasting may feel like it’s a huge deal but, I promise you, the real time wasted is the time you spend feeling like shit about yourself. That’s what you will carry with you everywhere, even in your productive moments. The feeling you should be doing more or be a different person leads to undeserved self-doubt and that’s what will truly hinder you. 

Find systems that work for you, keep seeking them until you do. Identify the non-negotiable’s and find a way to accommodate them. Don’t suppress who you are, find a way to fit your life around it. It may take some dedication and a few years to get there but that’s nothing in comparison to the time you’ll spend just feeling like garbage about things you can’t change about yourself. Yield a bit when you’re stuck, push back on it when you can.

This disorder isn’t magical but it does provide a unique perspective. A necessary one in a fair and just world. You’re here to radically love yourself as you are despite what the world around you may want you to feel or believe. Forge your own path."
"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","I'm 31 and I felt like this all through my 20s. It took me 7 years just to get my associate's degree in general studies, all the while working jobs that paid the bills but were nothing I wanted to do. Finally, right around when I turned 29, I decided to make some big life changes and I started therapy (primarily to deal with my marital separation, but I had needed to deal with my depression & anxiety long before that), I moved back in with my parents, and just took some time to let myself heal for awhile and not push myself to do anything but survive, especially since the pandemic started right after that.

Finally, about a year ago at age 30, and after 10-15 years of trying to figure out what I needed to ""do"" with my life, I actually figured out what path I wanted to take, and this whole past year I have systematically taken concrete steps to achieve my goals. Five months ago, I landed a job that I actually love and look forward to going to every single day. Yesterday, I started my first semester back in school in 6 years. In two days, I have a doctor's appointment to talk about finally getting assessed for ADHD, because I am currently undiagnosed. In two years, I should finally have my bachelor's. In about 6 years, hopefully I'll have completed law school and be practicing law somewhere.

My point is, it will get better. Therapy helps a lot, so I recommend it. Meds probably do too, but I am even doing the ""life on hard mode"" without them (but working on getting that diagnosis so I can get them), and things are still so much better than they were two years ago. But don't buy into the idea that life is over after 25 or 30 or whatever. There is time. Focus on what makes you happy - not like in a big picture sense, but enjoy TV shows, video games, books, food, talking to friends, loving on your pets, whatever brings you joy. That is what makes your life worth living anyway, not how successful you are. But by enjoying these small things, the bigger picture will reveal itself eventually.

Edited to add: I saw that you currently have Covid. When I had it a year ago I was HORRIBLY depressed and felt so similarly. It was literally in the weeks after that that I started taking some huge steps. Once you recover, you will feel much better, I'm certain."

"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","I was in the same exact situation as you but I was well into my 30s. I will offer up advise based on my own experience

1. The “idea” of where you believe you should be in life  right now (whether that be already married, employed with a good salary, living on your own and independent etc… ) - DROP IT. 

This “ideal” is like a moving goal post. Simply put, set goals for yourself (specially tiny ones like “do 10 pushups today”) as a means to building positive habits. Don’t overwhelm yourself with huge end goals. Small steps like spending 5 minutes every week on learning something… if it really interests you you will continue to learn for hours but commit to only 5 minutes! 10 pushups, 1 call you have been meaning to make. 

2. Accept that you are different. What makes everyone happy will not apply to you. To others you may seem uninspired or lacking drive but ultimately you may realize that happiness is not about settling for less but in finding what is right for you.

My current job is not paying me what I have been taught to believe I deserve but it pays the bills and allows me to stay sane. For now try to find that and go from there.

3. I know this is incredibly difficult but you have to find a way to limit your feelings of regret. You are so young still but even if you weren’t it seems you can only go up from here! Be kind to yourself. Treat yourself the way you would treat your best friend or a younger sibling. 

4. Look into some of the books others commented on. It is important to learn some techniques for dealing with your inner critic and other positive habits.

You will always have doubts. You will always ruminate and regret things you did and didn’t do. None of that matters anymore, focus on what you can do from here.

Wishing you the best."
"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","At 25, I was in the same place.

""I want to change, I've always wanted to change, but I just don't know how"" could've been my motto from my teens to my mid-20s.

In my 20s alone, I had already dropped out of college, moved back home, worked retail for a bit, gone back to a different school for a different major, moved across the country, and then spent two years post-graduation making no progress towards a dream job that by 25 I wasn't even sure I wanted any more.

I found a therapist, and basically just used her as a sounding board, someone to bounce ideas off of.

I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life, what I was passionate about. So I made a list of every job I thought I could possibly stand. I thought about the specific parts of previous jobs I had enjoyed doing, and the things I hated. Eventually I settled on IT.

It took months to find a job, but my therapist helped keep me accountable and on track.

Then when the pandemic started, I lost my job and fell back into old patterns. I found a new therapist, who helped me work on coping mechanisms, deal with anxiety, build my own structure. And when I asked about ADHD, she referred me to get diagnosed.

In the year since I've been diagnosed and started medicine (Strattera), I found a new job (still in IT) that pays nearly twice as much as I was making before. I've figured out a diet and cooking routines that work for me, and have lost 25 pounds and counting as a result. But I think the most important thing is I actually feel like I can set goals and make changes (even if progress isn't always perfect and linear). That wasn't the case, really, up until recently.

I think that's a combination of medication, therapy, strategies I've found from learning about ADHD online, plus understanding (and accepting) how my brain works."
"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","Hey mija o mijo. I started uni at 30. I skipped around a lot and didn't even settle into a degree until I found the one for me. I'll be graduating this year - after I turn 36.

I already have a job in my field. The uni ADORES me because I have knowledge from my 20s that stops me being an absolute selfish fool. Not afraid to ask questions, cause 30. Not afraid to ask for help, cause 30.

Age will bring you SO MANY opportunities... You just need to get them!!

Trust me, everyone is always up your ass until 25 anyway. After that they're like jajajaja yeah we all suck and have imposter syndrome. Then they'll offer you help and work and kindness.

People be MEAN to the under 25 crowd. They really do be like that.

Trust me mija o mijo, you'll thrive. ADHD and age go beautifully together. You KNOW now, and that's THE key. You can get medicated or not, work with it, get therapy or not... Fact is.. You know. And you know fairly early in life - though I know 25 doesn't feel like it. Not after this pandemic.

But you'll be OK mija o mijo, I know you'll be."
"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","Biggest thing I have to say is 25 is sorta still in development unfortunately.  While my situation is not similar in the slightest, I had a similar mindset when I was around that age. I was on my own with my wife in a different state than where I was born getting her through Law school.  By all rights I was successful for 25.  But then a dread hit me that I haven't actually ""done"" anything.

I spent the past 7-8 years of my life working in the service industry, getting promotion after promotion, worked my way up to running stores as a GM. All  this time I couldn't help thinking ""what am I actually learning.""  ""My wife is about to be a lawyer, and here I am making sandwiches to pay for rent and food.""  ""What kind of assistance can I even be in a relationship with that kind of dynamic.""  ""Shit, she's a lawyer.  If she want's to divorce me she's got all the power, I can't afford an attorney.""   

It ended up being a dark time when I came to realize that for all I had ""accomplished"" it really amounted to nothing.  For me, it only got worse.  As I rushed to try and ""prove my worth"" so to speak, I restarted college (I originally started right out of highschool and dropped out because I couldn't bring myself to do the work.  I wanted to, but you know. ADHD will have it's way if it needs to commandeer your body to do it sometimes and I ended up sitting right outside class till it was over each day.) Going a second time didn't end well... actually it was a dumpster fire where anything and everything that could go wrong did.  Residency was submitted two weeks before the due date, not processed by the ""pay your classes"" date and ended up being rejected. costing 4k in out of state tuition for classes I was promised would be reimbursed once residency came back.  The fight for a refund was long and arduous, and right when I finally won.. I gave up.  This was already mid way through the semester, and of course I was certain at the beginning I was getting that refund, so... I didn't do any of my classwork. On top of this, my wife began showing symptoms of an autoimmune disease, and I began trying to care for her, taking on all the housework, getting her to and from appointments, trying to keep her engaged... and unaware of just how bad school was getting.  It ended up an explosion of truth.  I... I really don't know how she forgave me, 4k down the drain, basic ass classes (like the ""New Student Learning Experience"") all failed, and I even left work to focus on school before all this.  

&#x200B;

Now. 

Where I was at then. Does not compare to where I am at now.  25 is so young. Back then I realized that, but didn't feel justified in saying it.  Now some odd years later I have a good job working as an insurance coordinator for a mental health clinic, specifically focused on TMS prior authorizations. I still have to deal with my constant ADHD symptoms (The spreadsheet I use to track patients progress in the authorization process is my greatest ally and my worst enemy T.T) I.. well I want to go back to school to try again (maybe when the pandemic is a bit more under control) and probably do something in the psych field, as working in the clinic has really helped facilitate hyperfixations about my own mental health.  I've been spending a huge majority of my downtime consuming information, and it's been really fun. 

What I am getting at here is, that time period can be rough.  You are only just coming to grips with the totality of society, and it feels like if you wanted to fit in, you were supposed to start when you were in 1st grade, now that you are 25, you not only missed the boat but you also burned the bridge and now have no chance to be useful, or successful.

Say it with me now, ""That is just not true.""  The thing you don't realize is you are on the boat, you always have been. Society will not wait for you to mature, it will beat maturity into you (provided your parents don't keep you off the boat.)  

The boat is about to reach port, and you are seeing the city skyline on your way in.  There is just so much there.  All the roads twisting and turning between huge buildings.  You are more than likely much better off than you think. It's just going to take hindsight to see it. 

Also, I am not sure if you are doing it currently, but try out some form of evidence based psychotherapy.  There are a lot of interesting therapy options with a good bit of research out there, but good ol fashioned CBT is always my recommendation, especially if you haven't seen someone before.  Stay away from the.. uhh.. ""Holistic"" or religious side of therapy, at least for a while.  I have yet to see any study that crystal healing is verifiably effective, and many religious counselors I have seen have next to no actual credentials (some do, but some also have made up doohickey, so just be careful if you prefer to go the religious route)"

1. Whoa, you're only 25 and you have a clue of what's going on in your brain? You have this community, and (too many) options for help. That's awesome. I used to think I was alone and a terrible human that managed to play a decent human on TV.
2. This is a weird weird weird time. Between Covid, politics, social media, and 10 other things, if you're not triggered, unsettled, and reassessing your life in some way right now, are you even human? Of course you are. And you're probably one of those people who can read words and take it all in.  Paralyzing. 
3. I've never known ""what I wanted"" and I think people who claim to know what they want are typically wrong. Obviously, YMMV, but what worked for me was to go a little scattershot and just do stuff that looked remotely interesting to me. At your age, it was easier for me to figure out what I didn't want to do vs what I did. (note I ran into other walls later on in life, but life)
4. Live in the present. You can only control what you do right now, so when you control what you do right now celebrate that little victory.  This is what I'm working on right now. Not every day is a good day for me, but if I have a bad morning, my best option is to try to have a better afternoon and let the morning go.

"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","People start degrees or switch careers at all points in life. Some of us need a little more time or a break and that's okay. When I noticed I was stagnating in my 20s I forced myself to go after the path that made the most sense and am making myself see it through. Maybe I won't stay in this career, maybe my degree will be ""wasted"" money...but we owe ourselves the chance to try. Through trying we learn more about ourselves and what we want. 

Honestly you're so young. I just talked to a 38 year old friend who is in the middle of her PhD after spending her life as a bartender. As for me I took extra years and a couple breaks to finish school and will be done with my master's at 30. My partner will finish their bachelor's at 30 as well. Push yourself.

It reduced the 'drag' mind fog and time blindness. Although time still slides by me but I think that's also due to the fact I live in an non structured environment. 
Nothing is a 100% fix but I was really amazed how well the 'right' meds worked for me. Once I got a bit better I had to work on building the skills normies have (they don't just appear when symptoms dissapate) that takes time too.


Edit/ add: I didn't start getting my shit together until after 25. Only got on the 'proper' meds maybe a year ago, everything before was effort, micro goals, lots of years and feelings of frustration. I'm turning 30 this year."

Best piece of advice I can give with respect to age and achievement is this. I would worry that doing X would take 3 years. Say I was 25. Someone said you'll either be 28 with X or 28 without X. Our working lives are long, and will undoubtedly become longer. Take a little time to become the person you want to be, the world will still be there. Don't let the past ruin your future, because ultimately both aren't real, you're only ever here. So make your present enjoyable and the future will follow :) 

With ADHD it's all about baby steps and treating ourselves like children (at least for me). Set your goals very low, but be consistent. Improve 1% a day, you can do it. Don't start running every day and burn out. Don't start meditating for 45 minutes and hate it. Jog for 3 minutes, meditate for 1. Then improve every day.

I'm nearly 25 myself, and I occasionally feel like I'm too young for my age, like I'm not ready for what life's throwing at me. At those times, I feel an almost crippling anxiety because I legitimately feel like I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing and don't even know how to ask for help."
"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","wow…. not very often i find a post that i relate so heavily to that i thought i wrote it myself. i’m in the EXACT same spot. i’m 23, just got diagnosed and prescribed Wellbutrin, but i haven’t noticed any difference :( haven’t had the motivation to talk to my doctor about a new medication, this post might motivate me to do that however! 

you’re not alone. i’ve been struggling with this thought daily. not many people know what they’re really doing in life! success and happiness are not linear :)"
"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","Early 20s was a write off for me too. I think its very common for us. I wouldnt blame yourself, if I was you. It would be weirder if it hadn't happened."

Some days I have no idea what I do, and I have projects that have been sitting around for a year or more. I try to have dreams but people around me call me childish and unrealistic, and at the end of the day my ADHD brain is so focused on the right-now that any possibility of the future is terrifying. Ugh, it's gotten a bit better after the meds but just thinking about how much time I've lost brings me down every single time."

My friend, if you feel like you’ve wasted time, make a list of things you want to do, and do them. 
If you’re in a race, the finish line is nowhere in sight (20’s) and there’s only one person ahead of you, push yourself and try to catch up. 

You got this!"
"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","Welcome to the club, I was in the exact some place at the same age. So I set a goal and started working towards it and got nowhere. At 28 I finally got diagnosed and medicated, Adderall makes a world of difference for me. Now that I'm medicated I can finally handle school and am studying to be a teacher."
"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","Happened to me. I still sometimes think on it, sometimes, but then I remember life is a marathon, not a sprint. Your best years are ahead - worry not - but consider allowing yourself the grace of finding your way and push forward and continue to build systems and find the right med titration. If you were advising someone who went through recovery during the same period, you'd be kind. You deserve that kindness too. I lost so. much. time. Through age 31, in fact, and only then did I start to slow the waste and it took until 36 to diagnose! I'm 40 now. Had no idea until 4yrs ago I had a mental chemistry issue. You are way better off. You will find your way and already are. One thing I always did to keep moving was taking shots. Doesn't matter at what, necessarily.  Regardless of outcome, keep your aspirations up in whatever ways you can. Look to ppl who inspire you, walk, listen to books, take in nature, exercise. At my lowest points, I reflected on what I knew I could do if I had my shit together and tried to aim my sights at it and improve one thing here and there. Short version, almost all of these were arguably net failures from a capitalist mindset, but there were always - always - several gains. I learned a shit ton of skills to help my get handholds. Ramit Sethi for example had a lot of personal positioning free advice on YT that moved me so far forward. But once I had meds, it all clicked. This note is emotional and rhetorical support, so of course I welcome and likely agree with tactics and strategies others have written. But you are not your early 20s. You are not your khakis, as Mssrs. Durden might say. You are much more than that and your story is only now unfolding! Read it. Write it! Much love!

EDIT: Read your meds posts. Keep titrating. Addy was harsh on my body, I stopped, then yrs of inefficacy later tried again. It helped a ton but more side effects. Tried Atomoxetine. Realllllly effective. Libido was fucking murdered. Loterally shrank the blood vessels in my dick!! Stopped it. Found Vyvanse, getting good effects without much harm and will probably try upping dosage and integrating more diet, sleep and exercise."
"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","Same boat. I'm 31. I have this feeling all the time and for a while in 2017 I listened to Pink Floyd's Time for almost a month because I couldn't cope with the feeling.

Idk, I think the only answer is to keep working. You see success over a period of time, and when you have \_none\_ of it at the point everything feels hopeless but when you have \_some\_ of it things look better and you can grown on top of that platform. Just focus on somehow building the platform even if it's small or rickety, but when you build something (be it getting better at communication, learning a new skill, reading a book) that helps your current situation you'll start feeling better and be able to build some momentum off of that. I got this advice from elsewhere, but if it took you a long time to find yourself deep down a rabbit hole it'll take a while to climb out of it so be patient and trust in the process and your actions."
"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","I’m with Paddy1948. I was diagnosed 4 years ago at 53. I had ADHD my entire life. School was a struggle. Life was a struggle. Reckless behavior was my friend because it was the only way I felt in control. Sounds odd, doesn’t it?

Keep lists…follow shopping lists, make a budget. This gives you an absolute sense of control over what you are doing.

Plan out your day and FOLLOW IT…nothing better than tackling everything head-on and not forgetting because something else popped into your head (speaking from a person that used to leave multiple projects started and never finished)

Take notes…Anytime something pops into your head at random, write it down and revisit later.

Find your passion…Do what you love and you will hyper-focus your way to success!

Best of luck to you. I do take Adderall 15mg XR in the am and 20mg in the afternoon. This keeps me on track."

I'm still working in my field but its just been bouncing from one job to the next unable to build skills before getting checked out and buried by imposter syndrome. I've been circling the drain while my peers and colleagues have continued on to grow in their fields and it just makes me feel fucking hopeless.  


All signs are pointing to the adhd and comorbid depression being treatment resistant so I just truly feel alone."
"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","I’m in the same boat as you. I’m 26 started meds this month and have been trying for the last year to improve myself. Who cares how much time you wasted? The only thing that matters is now, this moment. Make the change, get help and live. Some things that helped me before I got diagnosed and medicated were bullet journaling, thought journaling and stoicism/Buddhism (meditation, philosophy, etc.). The bullet journal helps me plan but also see what I have done. The thought journaling helps with emotions, I feel better when I lay it all out, it’s not meant for reference just vomiting emotion. Stoicism/ Buddhism has helped with meditation, living in the moment and self accountability and forgiveness. Im still doing these things and they are soooo helpful. Also advocate for yourself."
"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","Many people waste their whole lives. Try to forgive yourself for the times you falter in what you want to do. Living at home is a smart call, not something to be ashamed over (screw renting costs). I use alarms (daily/weekly/monthly etc.) to get past the time blindness a bit and make sure I stay on task to some extent. Sometimes it takes being in a really crappy position to give yourself the motivation to get out."

"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","Wow. I have never resonated so deeply with 100% of someone’s words like this before. This is literally the first comment I’ve ever made on reddit cause it rocked me that hard. I’m 28 and feel the exact same way, I feel like my last 10 years or so since high school have been aimless half attempts at making it look like I’m not a complete fuck up even though I have absolutely no idea what I’m ever doing. Growing up in elementary school it took me until about 4th grade until I realized the reason the other kids always knew what to do was because they were actually listening to and comprehending what the teachers would say when giving us directions, something that honest to god had not even occurred to me. Definitely a lot of natural shame that you sort of develop and nurture over time for being like this, but the fact that you’re genuinely invested in trying to figure it out goes to show that it’s not just some moral failing of yours and is a genuine debilitating mental condition. Almost every week me and my gf sit down and try to figure out ways for me to improve my habits to be more successful and every week I’m back where I started. I am medicated but it doesn’t work as well for me as it appears to for a lot of other people. I get very irritated and distant so it’s sort of a trade off for me. But obviously as you can tell from some of the other responses not only are you not alone and are heard, but some people here are experiencing almost the exact same thing along with trying everything in their power to overcome it, as you are trying to do. I feel constantly hopeless about ever getting to a stage where I feel relatively put together, but 3 years ago I was addicted to pain killers and didn’t have a job stuck in Alaska wasting away, and now I’m light years ahead of that with a good job and amazing girlfriend in San Diego and we just got another puppy. Key thing there is I was your current age and so many things since have changed for the better, while I feel myself personally has barely changed at all. My advice is to not lose hope that you’ll get where you need to be even though I know how soul crushing and impossible seeming it is. Don’t start valuing yourself less cause of your lack of direction just because you haven’t been in a situation that can help you thrive. You’re always still worth the world as long as you don’t give up on yourself!"

"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","I know it’s been a while but I actually have advice for this and doubt you’ve found some miracle cure in the last month.

So for the quick thoughts thing, I use writing. Like you were able to articulate your problem in this post. So get a notebook. When I write in my notebook my thoughts are forced to slow down to the pace of my hand. Sometimes my mind goes ahead, but then I can slow it down again, re read what I wrote and continue on. It has been the biggest improvement to my life since I found out I have adhd. Obviously getting yourself to actually write is a challenge. But when I do it helps so much for organise my thoughts, goals and perspectives. Obviously again, not all strategies work the same for everyone. Hope this helps even a little though."

"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","I'm going to tell you what my uncle told me when I was in my early twenties and wasting my life away.

You can continue sitting around where you are mulling over how others have may or may not have mistreated you, how others have had advantages that you didn't, how successful your peers have become as life has seemingly passed you by - and you will be in the same spot you are now, feeling **that** much worse about yourself and your situation and how the world and everyone in it has mistreated you.

Or

You can stop playing the victim, stop thinking about every little ""what if"" or option, stop caring what others think or may not think of you, stop looking for handouts or help and instead look for situations where you can prove yourself to yourself, and simply do what the fuck needs to be done. You can either make it in this world by trying something new that scares you every single day and adopting a brand new mindset - one which you chase life rather than waiting for life to find you - or you can keep on keeping on as you are now, in the same place you are now, feeling as you do now.. and the only person in this world that will feel sorry for you is yourself."
"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","Hmm.. Acknowledge and accept the things that have come and gone up to the present and have faith courage and belief, in yourself to find out through trial and error what it is exactly you wish to do because no one can figure that out except yourself. 

Welcome to life. 

The only way to break out of your cycle is to challenge yourself to discover and to learn to grow. 

Effort, dedication, courage are what its going to take to get moving. So ask yourself ""How can i be better today than I was Yesterday?""

Stop thinking so much as well. Be more of action from idea, NOT action in idea. You control the momentum and direction in your life, now chart your course in unknown waters and find out what is out there for you!!!!! :D"
"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","No time like the present, my friend.       

May I suggest taking a job abroad or that forces you to travel - peace corps or merchant marine - that will solve a number of your problems. At the very least you move out, start making money (which you can't spend easily very often), and develop some skills whether you want to or not. It has worked for many, many people, and it sounds right up your alley.     

Hope this helps."
"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","OP, I'm at the exact same point in my life, and just now I've started taking wellbutrin (which by the way doesn't work for me) and taking mindfulness therapy.

I've wasted my last 5 years and I am 25 too. 

But you know what? Stuff isn't going to change cause I sit and feel sorry for my ass. You've got to get up and say fuck it, I'm in charge of my life. Look for treatment, change doctors until you find one that works for you, look for all the solutions you can and turn your life around.

It is hard as fuck, but no one can do it for you, and giving up is not an option."

I finally took the plunge and got medicated again after over a decade and am rediscovering who I am and what I want out of life. It's like a new world has opened up before me now that I can slow down my thoughts and organize them. My only regret is that I waited so long to seek help for this condition. I can't change the past though, I can only learn from it.

I hope you can find a medication plan that works for you. Don't ever feel bad for needing it either, it would be like a paraplegic feeling bad for needing their wheelchair."

I keep trying to learn new skills now that I realize I need to get my shit together and it's getting me nowhere. Just started medication today so I'm hoping it works out. 

But I have faith in you, you have so much time! You're so young. My advice would be to get an A.S. in a tech related skill that has low-stress jobs and just charge through it. Once you have that money rolling in you can focus on what you want to actually do with your life since you'll at least have the money, the sanity, and the time to do it."
"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","How could you know what you want if you never *found yourself lost?* Many people are, in my view, dispassionately institutionalized. They work to live, to be happy. Whichever. That is fine. Though, as having ADHD, there isn't a casual choice through life, because frankly, we're misfits. We're not punctual, we don't think in evenly split moments of time, days, weeks, or months. There are thoughts and they leapfrog into one another.

In modern society, we're broken records. Like a lo-fi record with too much noise, or too short an exhaust bumbling about. But see, that is where the magic happens. That is where knowledge ends and creativity starts. No, not due to ADHD necessarily, but due to the circumstances requiring unusual adaptations to cope. That is where you start realizing you're different and common sense doesn't apply.

I used to break over and over thinking I would never fit in. I did not indeed. I realized however, when you break, our minds rewire in new ways if you learn to allow it to detour. It cannot help *but* find new ways to adapt. When you fail in life sufficiently, there is one gift bestowed, and that is resilience. Passion is not ruled by reason or measurement but an adamant desire to express. Sometimes you just have to ram headfirst through the wall until either the wall breaks or your skull breaks. Because you know you will get through one way or another.

If society does not let you in, force yourself in. Find your own books, make your own education, create your own luck. The means justify the end. If someone gives you crap about morals, point to the burning wreck behind you and ask them again. Everyone wants to do good, yet few want to take responsibility for themselves to do what is required to succeed that is unconventional. Life **is** unconventional."

That is to say, you are definitely not alone. There's a reason this album and this song are so well regarded. This is a somewhat universal feeling I think, regardless of where you are in life and how successful you. Some people hide it better than others, and some people distract from it or learn to ignore it, but most people feel it on some level.

(some turn to religion to find their purpose in life, which is what the last few lines are referring to, and what the next song on the album is about.)

Edit: can you tell I love this album? It covers so much of the modern human experience in such a universal way."
"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","I get these feelings too, we all wanna not “waste” our time. I recommend a couple things:  journaling, not just your feelings and thoughts, but dreams, make believe on paper. If you feel stuck, try writing imaginary letters to yourself from future you. Etc. list things that make you feel calm and safe. 

Another great way to nurture your sense of self is meditation, and some forms of exercise function perfectly well as meditation, with the added benefit of feel good brain chemicals. 

And a mantra: you are not your narrative. You are not a narrative. Your life isn’t supposed to fit a specific story structure, or be an efficient or prudent use of time. You’re allowed to do nothing. You’re allowed to rest, to wander, to ponder, to just exist."

There is this idea that if we don’t have our shit together in our 20’s we are failing but it just isn’t the reality for literally anyone. We are so young we have so much time to figure it out and get fixated on something until we remember what we were doing and figure it out again 😂

I feel you on the goals things sometimes I'm like is this actually something I like and want to do or what is the neurotypical expectation. I'll be turning 25 soon too and it's definitely hard not to feel behind when so many of my peers (and even younger) seem to be much further in life than I am.

"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","despite being younger, i absolutely feel this, and tbh for me it gets so bad that entire days, hell, nearly entire weeks pass by and i come out of that stagnation feeling like i’ve just been in some weird stasis that whole time, watching everything go on around me. honestly, my best advice besides the usual (medication, therapy, etc.) is not to just set a goal or pick an activity you like, but to perform that goal/activity in a way that forces you to get up and do it regardless of whether you actually want to. while very niche, for me it’s being a volunteer firefighter and emt. do i particularly want to get up and go turn off someone’s fire alarm, or go help grandma up when im really not in the mood to even be a human being? absolutely not, but it forces me to get out of my house and interact with people, whether it’s the people on call or my friends in the department. imo it helps to really break up the periods of stagnated time, and makes me feel at least a little better (for the most part, getting woken up at 2am will never be fun lol). obv this isn’t an easy choice for most people to j decide they want to do, but maybe even volunteering at a shelter or somewhere else of interest in your free time? would force you to get out, be active, and interact with people, while also doing an activity you don’t absolutely hate lol"

"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","Obviously you aren't alone on feeling like this. I'm recently diagnosed but have struggled with symptoms since childhood. ADHD makes a lot of little things hard. Keep pushing forward and don't give up. I think of it like people end up taking the more scenic route in life rather than the direct path, even if we don't mean to sometimes, but that can often teach us or expose us to many different things along the way and help make us more well rounded. 

I got diagnosed a few months ago, but here are a few tips that have helped me. Find a good team of professionals you trust. A good psychiatrist can help you find your ideal medication, although it might take several tries for some people. Therapy (from a psychologist, counselor, social worker, or other mental health professional) can also help so much. So far, mine has helped teach me skills such as time management, stress management, mindfulness, setting SMART goals, reducing procrastination, reducing distractions, etc. Wearing a watch, using Google Calendar, and setting timers on my phone have also helped me a lot. You can also learn from other resources too, such as YouTube, books, and articles online. 

For your education, I recommend sticking as close to your original passion as you can but adjust to something similar depending on your strengths and/or weaknesses if needed. I ended up with several degrees because I'm academically gifted overall but faced certain struggles that kept me from reaching the goals I had in mind for myself. Instead of trying something similar when I didn't succeed as intended, I tried something totally different but wasn't satisfied years later. Then I went back to school again for something closer to what I originally wanted but was better suited for. 

You can try this [career quiz/interest profile](https://www.mynextmove.org/explore/ip) from the US Department of Labor to make sure you're on the right track to a career that you'll love based on your career interests and amount of time and education you'd like to put in. 

Since ADHD qualifies as a disability, you can also request ADA accommodations for things like school, work, and certification exams for professional associations. Accommodations can be different things to help people be more productive, function better, make things easier for them, etc. It can be things like more time on tests, excused time off from work for doctor appointments/therapy, additional meetings or feedback from managers at work, using noise cancelling headphones or earplugs to reduce distractions, etc."

It's good you're realizing some shit now, but don't waste another day not taking care of things. Go to therapy and actually do the work they prescribe you. And if my opinion means anything, absolutely quit drinking now.  Alcohol will not help anything in the slightest."
"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","I stopped thinking in ways of ”what do I want” and just do what I feel is fun at the time. For education I quickly pciked something that I loved doing and just said I need to finish it no matter how I feel. I’ve been working as a product designer for the last 6 years soon and I’m still loving it. Having so much fun doing different projects and working with different companies (soo important that things are constantly changing for me).

Please try and not think about what you’ve wasted and instead shift your mindset to what you can do right now instead. Have one goal to focus on (like finding something to study) and try to accept all the other things, like still living at home. I also live at home (to save money for an apartment) and everytime I see friends moving in, I remind myself that I’m still at home because I CHOOSE to be. For me it really was all about my mindset and not so much waiting for the stars to align before I felt happy again"

Start doing stuff towards a goal. Take a wild shot and miss... or hit. It doesn't matter, doing stuff is 100% the solution to feeling like you didn't do enough. Whatever framework or support makes that happen, latch onto.

>Nothing makes sense anymore,

I've got some years on you, so a little bit of unsolicited life advice.... It's not meant to make sense. Other people telling us about their goals and life always sounds amazing right? Because they're taking everything that doesn't make sense, filtering out the bullshit, and you're hearing the remaining bits and how it pertains to what they want.

You can choose to either not care that it doesn't make sense, or you can choose to which bits of real life match what you want and discard the rest. Then everything makes sense because you ignore the bollocks of it all."
"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","Yah it be that way sometimes. I have so many thoughts going through my head at all times and as you said, it's impossible to pin-point certain ones. Specifically, ones that include what I want to do with my life. Everything feels very out of control sometimes and you might think you have it all figured out one day and the next, you have different goals, directions, beliefs. I've changed my career path so many times I've got whiplash, and I've got so many thoughts racing through my brain I can't slow down and take time to consider. What even is time? It's too fast, there's too much going on, yet it feels like for years I've been doing absolutely nothing, living to work and working to live and what-not. Sucks"
"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","I'm 30 and just started taking Adderall again for the first time since high school. The last couple of years I started to panic - feeling like I wasted my 20s. Now I don't look at it that way as much - more like I got to spend a decade figuring out who I am as an adult, what I like, and how to handle jobs/relationships/etc. Of course there's a couple of things I wish I would have done differently. 

The big one right now is that I wish I would have worked on my credit more by paying school loans on time and keeping a credit card open. Now I'm having to rebuild my credit which takes time. But it's also not the worst thing in the world - the thought of even looking at my credit used to make me want to shove my head in the sand - but now it's not as difficult to start building back up as I thought it would be. 

I think when we're younger we have this mentality that we need to have everything done by a certain time in order to be successful in life. But in reality you can look at someone who has finished school, landed the perfect job, got married, had kids, etc, and for all we know they could hate their lives. Many people end up wishing they'd taken the time to just enjoy themselves when they were younger.

Maybe try and change your perspective on your life. It might help to think ""I'm glad I got to spend part of my life just enjoying it. Now I want to do this ____"" And then pick one goal that interests you to work towards and figure out how you can make that a priority. Consider hiring a coach, looking into meds, asking parents or friends to help keep you accountable - anything that might help. I had to move back in with my parents multiple times in my 20s and looking back I wish I had asked my parents to make me pay rent and just keep that money saved up for me when I wanted to move out or go back to school. 

Anyway, know that you are absolutely not alone in feeling this way - especially among those of us with ADHD. It's difficult for us to choose a path when our brains switch interests so fast."

I know, it's not very uplifting, but honestly, who cares? Stop caring about fitting in, been diag at 32, now 34, the more i try to fit in the more i struggle the more i feel like shit. From an outside view (friends, familly) i greatly improved my life but honestly i never felt more shittier than right now.

I know this feeling intimately, and I still have it from time to time. You can however change to a way of thinking that is more aimed at your possibilities rather than your failures and less punishing towards you.

"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","I am 31 and felt this way about my entire 20s. I felt like those years were lost to depression, anxiety, stagnation, isolation, unhappiness, failure. But time passes so fast, and the longer you stay trapped in that thought process the more time you'll waste. You can't berate yourself back in time. Theres no changing it. Meanwhile, your life moves on. I decided I didn't want to have the chapter that followed to be the chapter of regret. I'm certainly not perfect and I absolutely have my down days, but I try to just see my 20s as part of my journey. They weren't great, but I did exist, and I did learn some things along the way.  Write it into your story. Look towards the future and set some very small, achievable goals. Take it a day at a time. You only exist in the present, and before you know it another 5 years will have gone past. Do you want to have wasted those 5 years regretting the 5 years that came before it? Soon, the years you're focusing on now with so much regret will be just a period in your past. Don't let it hold you prisoner.

Also, try not to compare yourself to others. I'm currently living with my parents and saving to buy a house. I probably won't manage it until my mid-thirties. Many of my friends bought in their early 20s, and I spent so much of my time feeling like a failure. I didn't have a good enough job, or enough money, or a partner, or whatever. I compared myself too much to other people. But my life is just on a different track. Its on its own schedule. Try to trust in the journey if you can trust me, I know it's hard. But life isn't a series of milestones someone else has set out. Im choosing choosing save for a house because I'm in a position to, and it's right for me now. That's all. Not because it is is is expected of me. Even if you meet none of the expectations of modern life, what matters is you are happy. Focus on happiness and it can go wrong. It'll be hard, but never wrong."

It’s never too late. I know the feeling, like everyday that you don’t “do something” you are failing. 

Give yourself a year or so, 26 or 27, as a goal to “not be where you are now.” Then when that time hits, whether or not you’re ready, do SOMETHING “drastic.”

Join the peace corps for a while, teach English In Korea, anything. There are opportunities that you don’t need to be able to pay for. Throw yourself into something and just react and learn. People with ADHD aren’t always good at routine and planning, but we are good at adapting when we must. And as you do things, you’ll find your passion and interest, and you won’t be able to sit still long enough to become anxious. Just put yourself out there with something dramatic and you’ll figure it out. 

I don’t know how much time you have left in school, but if you make this kind of time goal for yourself, you may get motivated to finish school because you’ll be “out of time.” But even if you won’t get school done…maybe you need a sabbatical. School isn’t life, don’t let it hold you back from growth. I graduated from college, but it took me 8 years, and I was literally almost done with it when I lost motivation. 

My dramatic effort was moving in with a friend across the state and working two jobs until an opportunity presented itself. That friend became my girlfriend, now wife, and I started a salary job that slowly helped me find a niche and career I was interested in. It took me a while, but now I’m happy with my life and career."

I don't think we need to feel hopeless or regretful for not living up to the frankly unnatural standards that society sets forth for people. 

If you can keep a roof over your head, food in the fridge, and be satisfied, I see it as a strength and not a weakness.

Like I said, the society we live in is often unrealistic, unnatural, and unreasonable. Not conforming to ideas about what life should look like is actually very normal, and you're likely living a more natural human experience than the workaholic who shotguns a liter of coffee every morning just so they can pilot their almost lifeless bodies to a 9-5 desk job."

"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","Big same. I am 26, I had big dreams and a ton of ""potential"" as a kid, and I have done absolutely nothing with it. I managed to finish my degree (with a 'gap' year and an extra semester), but have forgotten approximately everything I learned somehow, and I don't even work in my field anymore.

But I am working on it. My advice is to start very, very small with your goals. You don't have to do everything at once.

Start with small goals, and start with the most vital to your basic functioning. You can't start with the bigger goals until your mental health is under control.

For me, the goal order goes like this (with my personal examples in parentheses):

1. Mental health (basic -- meds, therapy)
2. Physical health (basic -- hygiene, basic nutrition, sleep)
3. Basic needs (job/school, housing, financial security, food, etc)
4. Life Quality goals (hobbies, friendships, leisure activities, art)
5. Improvement goals (starting to exercise, organization, learning skills, reading more, improving grades, etc)
6. Big Scary Life Goals (saving for a house, grad school, figuring out what I want for my career, pursuing said career, art and composing goals, weight loss, etc)

(I put Life Quality before improvement because for me, personally, it is very hard to work on scarier goals without a strong base of fulfillment from life.)

I'm still working on 1 through 5, but I had to get 1 nailed down before I could even think about the rest.

It sounds like you have a ton of anxiety, and you don't know where to start. I would say to start with your basic mental and physical health needs -- those are the foundation of everything else. Then, pick one goal for your basic needs, work it, and continue. 

I stalked your profile briefly to see if you had posted about being on medication -- it sounds like stimulants may not be for you, or maybe you need something else to help the anxiety. Get the meds nailed down, and *then* you can start focusing on other goals.

Good luck!"

"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","So couple thoughts here:

First off, you’re only 25. That’s really young. A lot of people are still living at home at that age, especially in other countries (I assume you are in the US.) You have plenty of time to pick a path in life and do what you want. And you don’t have to find a passion (in terms of your career.) I work for a state agency, it’s not particularly interesting, but it’s a good job with good pay and benefits. I got my degree in a completely unrelated field. 

Second is that nearly everyone experiences this. It’s not an ADHD thing. You go about you life day by day and then “what the hell it’s been 5 years already?!?! I’ve done nothing with my life!”

>	You are young and life is long, and there is time to kill today.

>	And then one day you find ten years have got behind you

>	No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

The third, and this can be a comfort or terrifying, is that most people don’t really do anything noteworthy with their life. People often stress about not doing enough and accomplishing enough, but the average person really has very little impact on the world. If you move out at 27 and get some generic office job and live in a mediocre apartment, nobody cares.  Nobody is going to be disappointed in you, except you."
"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","From Baz Luhrman's ""Sunscreen"" (1999):

""Don't feel guilty if you don't know what to do with your life. The most interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives. Some of the most interesting 40 year olds I know still don't.""

Time blindness makes me feel like these past 24+ years have disappeared in the blink of an eye.
Personally been medicated for ADHD since 8th grade, but unfortunately it wasn't until this year (Age 25!) that the doctors finally managed to get the dosage/med type correct. Even then, every day I feel stressed out about not accomplishing enough, or about not finishing college yet, or even about forgetting little tasks! Because of being diagnosed & medicated so young, it makes me feel... bad, I guess, that I'm still struggling with getting things done. There's a lot of people who aren't able to receive help until adulthood, so it feels like I should be able to do more.

But! That being said it's important to remember that everyone grows at their own pace. It's easy to feel pressured due to expectations in society, but no one is exactly the same. You can only measure your grow and accomplishments against your own circumstances! At the end of the day it's important to remain kind and patient with yourself as well. It's hard for us to do well and thrive when our inner voice is beating us down... (although it's okay to have moments where it happens!)

You still have plenty of time to do the things you want to do. You still have opportunities, chances, and the strength to make little steps towards your future! Go for it!!"

*If you want it, go and get it.*   


It's never too late.   


You, too can achieve what you want.  
One step at a time. Make it easier for yourself, not harder.  


Don't know what you want? **Just start somewhere**. Sometimes preparation is **not** the key, and sometimes you just need to try some stuff out."
"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","I wish I could help you. Anything I say is meaningless unless you want to make a change. But I'll try.. This is how you get out of that funk. 

1) Realize you want to make a change. \*you are here  
2) Sit down, block out any distractions and write out how your life is now compared how you see your perfect life in 5 years. Visualize it. Detail it out. Ask yourself what does it look like? What does it feel like? Describe it in detail.   
3) Put this writing somewhere where you will see it everyday and just quickly review it once in the morning and night.   
4) That's it. 

What will happen is as you review this daily once in the morning and once at night, you will subconsciously start to gravitate towards your ideal self.. you might have an ideal self of losing 20 pounds with a goal weight of 180 pounds and so you review this everyday once in the morning and once at night.. as you do this you carry this thought with you subconsciously throughout the day and slowly start doing the things you need to do to reach this goal. As you start your day with this new mindset, you will without effort start taking the steps to get closer and closer to your goal(s). This goes for any goals you write down. 

If you find yourself not moving forward with a goal, what you need to do is another writing exercise where you ask the question ""what is holding me back?"", and just free-write. Write out anything that comes up and don't stop until you find the root cause. Often there is a limiting belief or mindset about something that is preventing you from moving forward. Does that belief or mindset serve you today? If not.. change it. Mindset is everything and if you let external stimulus such as other people, TV or social media decide how you should think and feel which is contrary to your goals.. well shit.. yes of course your will be depressed and anxious because you are going against your own wants and desires. 

I can go on and on.. but this should be good enough to follow and take action.

Just wait until your 30's...

Jokes aside, you're right. It's a problem that many of us feel everyday.

One thing that I will say seems to work for me, is changing my environment. Get out of the house. Find ways to trick your brain into ""productive mode"". Go to the library, the coffee shop, spend time studying or planning in the classroom after class.

Consider your options regarding getting out of your parents house. It isn't financially feasible for many at your age, but for some, it's a requirement for moving forward.

As for goal setting. It's unfortunately going to be a hard requirement for clawing your way out of the hole you're feeling trapped in. This DOESN'T mean that you are beholden to any goals you set. You should always be reevaluating your situation, reaffirming that you are still on the correct path. But you HAVE to pick SOMETHING.

Maybe try adopting the limited time perspective that you statistically only have about 55 years left on the planet, and that is FAR from guaranteed. So you need to get moving if you're going to prioritize being happy and accomplished for most of those. We wake up to basically the same routine every day, this tricks our brain into expecting to always wake up to the same opportunities, implying that we have plenty of time to do anything we want. But we don't. We miss out on opportunities EVERY DAY, and one day, we won't wake up. 

No one gets anywhere running in 360 directions at once, and unfortunately, that's the first instinct for many of us.

Check out a couple books:
* Driven to Distraction
* Deep Work
* Atomic Habits

Also maybe look into Bullet Journaling, ADHD creators like Jessica @ How to ADHD."
"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","I've been through it at was at your place in my mid 20s. 

It took me eight years to finish college - I was unmedicated and undiagnosed and broke, so no money for therapy.

Then I finally graduated and got a fast paced job in tech which plays to my strengths. Started medication to treat anxiety and ADHD and therapy. 

It's always a challenge but I got to make up for the lost time by believing in myself and working hard.

It's never too late, and 25 is super young! You can do it and overcome this phase."
"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","I know exactly what you are going through and I'm 42. My appointment is in March and I'm just glad to have some hope with no expectations. The self talk can get maddening at times. Today is the first day of the rest of your life, enjoy and good luck."
"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","I think I see the real, deeper problem here. You're caught between blaming yourself or blaming ADHD and likely vacillating back and forth. The first half of your title says time blindness caused it, the second half mentions being filled with regret. If time blindness caused it, why the regret? You're looking for a deeper answer that doesn't neglect any factors. It's possible that you were doing the best you could up till now, while also still needing to do better going forward. You have growth to make and barriers to overcome. There's no reason to be hard on 20-25 year old you though at all. That's pretty early to realize the ways in which you want to grow. I just finally started grad school in my 40's, and I don't regret my path in getting here at all. 20 something me finished a psych degree because I liked psychology. 40-something me wants to make a difference, serve my community, and give back. People spending their early 20's figuring themselves out and what matters is well within par for the course. That part seems totally normal even by neurotypical standards to me, 25 is honestly ridiculously young to be feeling like you wasted your potential. So my advice is to forgive yourself for taking this long to figure out that you want to make changes. Now move onto the changes part. 

What you're talking about is long term procrastination as this hilarious yet all too familiar [Ted talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_urban_inside_the_mind_of_a_master_procrastinator) points out. 

There's a highly recommended book (that I never finished lol) called ""You Mean I'm not Lazy, Crazy, or Stupid?"" as well as looking for other systems and solutions for managing the effect of your symptoms on your life. I use Siri and Alexa heavily, pill reminders, and I just bought post-it notes to start leaving myself notes near things that need to be addressed when I have time. I might start putting helpful wisdoms on some, who knows? I made a separate home screen widget on my phone for ""urgent"" tasks separated from the rest of my reminders. What I'm trying to suggest is that you work on creating systems that work for you that counteract your symptoms. Set a monthly reminder to examine your life's direction if you need. Mostly though, I give myself a break and realize that everyone has struggles, these are just what mine look like. 

Final takeaway though...dude, 25 is way too young to be beating yourself up for not making more of your life. Like waaaaay waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyy too young. Show yourself some of the kindness and empathy that you wouldn't hesitate to show others."

"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","You have a lot of time. You're not alone in your experiences. 

This world is not an easy place, and surviving in it without losing your kindness or compassion is an accomplishment on its own. I know how ADHD creates a terrible feedback loop between executive disfunction and rumination, and the best advice I have is to find any toehold to disrupt that loop. Try experimenting with incremental next steps that are positive changes rather than getting consumed with where it'll all wind up.

For me, stable work made a huge difference. At 33, I was still working in a bookstore because I could never get myself to decide what I wanted to do. Sheer financial desperation got me to start applying for things, and through luck and persistence, I managed to land my first career-path job at 35 (and I got it because it related to some of the personal interests that I'd hyperfixated on, that I'd been told over and over were a waste of time--so don't discount anything you spend your energy on). At 38, I got my ADHD diagnosis and started meds, and I realized parts of my job were making me unhappy, so I got a better job. My work isn't related to any of the things I thought I wanted from life when I was younger, but it challenges and rewards me in ways that don't overwhelm me.

I still don't know what I actually want to do with my life, and I'm sad that I lost so much time. But getting some stability made it easier for me to understand that I can't change my entire life all at once and to take a step back from that destructive ADHD feedback loop. The best thing I can do with my energy is identify the next step I can take that will be an improvement."

Well said, especially these parts. Many will imply, or straight out accuse you, of being ""immature"" for your age. What I see in their actions, however, is a thinly veiled jealousy that I didn't bog myself down with societal pressure to conform, like they chose to do.

Make me see how much adhd affects me and how much different it is to be neurotypical."
"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness",">sudden epiphany on why I don't just change my life and then the next day I had already forgotten about it

Oh man this is totally me. It's like I hit the reset button on my brain every morning. It's so annoying. Right when I think I finally have things figured out, and I finally feel some optimism, I'm back to square one. I've been dealing with that since I was a teenager, and because of that it still feels like I've gotten nowhere"
"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","I stagnated for a year here and there, and I know the pain of looking back and asking how it happened. After it happened a few times, I realized the pattern and started coming up with a few ways to break it. Here's my technique for developing goals and continuing on my ""life path"" as it were.

## Rule 1. Always be learning

It doesn't matter what. Spent all summer learning about geology? Great! Write it down. The past six weeks you learned enough about the music theory of India? Cool, write it down.

This way, I'm never turning off that tap of knowledge, meaning it is always flowing and I'm always growing. By writing things down, I have the ability to potentially draw on that knowledge, and developing the **skill of learning.**

## Rule 2. You Don't Get to Choose

I don't get to choose when I want to do something. It's like there's a rat in my brain pulling the levers of motivation, and I just need to obey the rat. When I obey the rat, it's like going downhill and everything is easy. When I want to do something else, it's like going uphill and everything is hard if not impossible.

The trick is recognizing the rat will **always** change its mind. Sometimes several times a day, and it's possible to recognize that and even maybe wait it out. Knowing you're playing tug-of-war with yourself is instrumental in winning. Otherwise you keep getting knocked on your ass without knowing why.

## Rule 3. Long-Term Goals aren't Dreams

In my head, I'm super competitive, and I have a hard time convincing myself anything worth doing if I can't somehow be the best at it. Furthermore, the **big thing** I want to do changes pretty regularly. 

I took a long time to recognize that those are *dreams* and I can't follow them because they are too ephemeral to capture. Letting go of the pride, that false sense of ambition, all of it is always so difficult.

## Developing Long-Term Goals

Given the above, long-term goals seem impossible. I have a mental list of things I want(ed) to do that goes on forever. However, there are things I keep returning to, things that align to who I want to be as a person. This may not be a career goal or even a fun goal but something that's important to you. It's got to be important, and not just a dream.

I ask myself, ""this time next year, who are you? How can you be that person?""

### Get to the Next Step

There's an image of myself that I know I can't imagine goals for. So, what's just one step toward being that person? That's my goal. If I want to climb mountains, I'll plan to get better at hiking. If I want to write a game I'll plan to get better at game design.

My desire is to eat the elephant in one bite, the reward of success seems so tangible in my heart. It is not, and I need to be honest that by the time I get to the next step I may not want the end goal anymore.

### Break it Down

Writing a book is just pressing a few buttons hundreds of thousands of times. Every goal can be infinitely divided until I can see the whole picture. That doesn't mean I break everything down, but I have enough detail to where I understand how this goal will start and know roughly the size. I won't lie, this process is **hard work.** If you can, bribe a friend with pizza or something to help you out!

### Plan to Change

*AKA Don't work harder, work different.*

Expect to be wrong a lot, especially starting out. I thought an online course would take you a month, but instead it's taken me... well I never finished it. It didn't hold my attention, and so instead I had to find another way to learn the same content. That pushed out my plans, but I still was moving toward my goals."

I use to get hung up on my friends that were done or blue collar making money. Moving out. But then I realized there are a lot of older people who give things up like freedom to finish school. 

But that’s only if school is truly what you want and not what you think you need. If your next path you want is a career without school, you can definitely do it. 

I hate living at home, but that’s not my mentality anymore, nor that I enjoy it to be clear. But it’s the only way I can do school full time in California, and it’s what I want. Before this I was in HVAC making okay money for a bit."

"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","To add to this, things like finishing school aren't the only ways of feeling like you're not stagnating in life. I'd be curious if you want to finish school and move away from home because these things fulfill your own internal drive OR because you feel guilty about not matching social expectations. Perhaps you feel like you're not fulfilled? Or like you're disconnected from our innate need to be social, productive beings? If this is the case productivity and connectedness can come in many, many forms. Maybe I'm off base. These are thoughts I'm working through myself so they're not entirely clear."

"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","It's not a matter of playing the victim. It would be real great if it was as simple as just doing what needs to be done. I'm not the type of person to accept help or complain. When I have issues, I force myself to deal with them straight on and do it alone. As someone who takes pride in independently fixing things, you can imagine how much self-hate I had developed for not being able to just do things no matter what I try or how hard.

I deal with a lot of the same things the OP does. Last year, I was working on a simple form for hours. I reread the questions over and over and my mind just wouldn't process it. Last month, I was working on final projects that took me all week, making extremely slow progress. It's not normal for me to take that long and I felt pressured and overwhelmed at the end of it. I could barely get through finals; my brain just wouldn't absorb any information as much as I tried to study. My undiagnosed ADHD gradually got worse as I kept adding pressure. I felt like my mind was failing me despite the ambitions and capabilities I knew I had.

The mindset you speak of is what tore me apart for years. I know its your uncle's advice and I respect that it might have helped you. I just want to point out that when you're talking about a disorder, it's not exactly a clear cut situation that you can just force yourself to fix by changing how you think. That kind of advice can make a whole lot of people feel hopeless and incompetent, despite being fully capable of change if they had the right help."

Ritalin wears off within 2-4 hours I never had sleeping issues on it as long as I took my last dose before 5pm or so"
"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","I had to try 3 drugs before finding the one that works well for me. By work well I mean it makes it easier to get started and do tasks as well as getting stuck in unwanted hyper focus. Not 100% but night and day and it lets me focus on the other things that help me regularly. Meditation, excercise, friendships, art, and regular therapy and coaching. 


I know what you mean about feeling the potential of lost time. I went through a deep grieving period. Some of it was real grief. Some of it was internalized beliefs that were other peoples expections of who I should be. You’ve got to sort that out. A way that it was liberating though was remembering all these past failures and missteps and not having to feel shameful about them anymore because I can’t be who I thought I should be even by trying as hard as I could. Being able to really sink in and take stock of my strengths and idiosyncrasies in a new way and slowly accepting my sometimes severe limitations. I still have a lingering sense of not “good enough”. 


If you are a reader, listener check out CPTSD by Pete Walker. It’s not about ADHD. It’s about healing from painful childhoods and adolescence and becoming emotionally alive again. Most people that didn’t learn they had adhd seem to have a lot trauma from not knowing and feeling so bad about themselves for so long.


Best of luck finding your way. I have faith you can if you keep being curious and keep reaching out for help. You deserve help and you deserve to live a life that you love living."

"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness",Sounds like too high of a dose. Obviously doctors are important but never just take the full dose first time. Take a quarter or half and then adjust from there.
"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","For my I use Ritalin, but it makes me kinda depressed-ish, but my girlfriend uses a combination of Dextroamphetamine and Zoloft (anxiety meds) to counteract the anxiety part of dextro, and it works really well for her. It apparently makes you hyper focus more often and have short bursts of being wicked productive."
"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","If you're taking an extended release medication, you can ask your doctor for a shorter release version so it doesn't interfere with your sleep.

On a separate note, I didn't feel like I started""growing up"" until I was 26. Some people need more time and that's ok. In the grand scale of things, we're all just specks of dust. What does it matter if one speck takes a few more years to meet some arbitrary goals set by other specks?"

I also have no idea why doctors start people off with 10-15mg or more? Wtf? Surely the best thing to do is start with the lowest possible dose which is 5mg.

Extended release causes amphetamine levels to be higher in the evening, near when you need to sleep. Instant release is superior in this way since it should be mostly cleared by bed time.

If you're feeling like you want to try medication again, go with 5mg and instant release."

Adhd meds like adderall + anxiety medication like zoloft changed my life.

"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","What helped me get the ball rolling with effective therapy was writing. Just as you've done here, in your main post -- I'd take what I was feeling and write about it while I was feeling it, and then read what I'd written in therapy. Recalling exactly what to talk about is really difficult when you're on the spot and the clock's ticking. If you want to make the most of your time, it's helpful to organize your thoughts beforehand -- ideally actively throughout the week as they come to you. A little clarity goes a long way, but you've gotta (or at least *I've* gotta) grab it when it's there and document it, or it's easy to forget.

I moved out of my parents' house about a year and a half ago, at 27. That was before I'd been diagnosed, but I was lucky to have friends with more focus who could help me, and a future roommate who I could divide tasks with and we could get on each-others' asses about sending that email or finding some options or whatever.

After my diagnosis and start on proper treatment last year, it's been a fuckin game changer. I could've gotten out of that house years ago if I was *this* in control of myself. But I wasn't, and it wasn't anybody's fault. I was doing my best. I just didn't know how much better I could do, couldn't get a handle on *what* was holding me back.

It sounds like you're doing the right stuff. Just stick with it, give yourself time, and make the most of the options you've got. It feels awful right now, but you're on your way. Sometimes growth is slow and hard to appreciate, but it's always painful, and that pain is always worth it. You're on the right track, you've fuckin got this."

Also, I hope you find a spot where you don't have to deal with constant competitiveness. I have no patience at all for that shit."

1000%

I was building my life around my ADHD long before I knew I had it. I felt entirely incompatible with the working world, so I freelanced. I still don't make great money, but I get to work from my little home office and wear pajamas or sweats every day, and it works for me. 

I felt incompatible with romantic relationships, so I just focused on my mental health and getting my work life moving. Last year, at 28, I had my first serious relationship since fuckin high school. It didn't work out (pre-ADHD diagnosis, I had too much going on and felt like a bad partner), but now I'm actually *open* to it, instead of just shutting out options and feeling destined to be alone. I'm *comfortable* alone, I actually enjoy my own company now, but I don't feel stuck there.

You seem like you can organize your thoughts pretty well when you're focused on it. Just keep doing that, keep giving some focus to these things. You'll find where you fit and what you're comfortable with. It'll take more effort than a lot of your peers have to put in, but *you can do it.* I know you can, because I did, and I'm nothing special.

Feel free to reach out if you need an outlet or wanna bounce shit off someone. Sounds like our experiences have significant overlap, I've just found myself crawled out of that hole sooner than felt possible when I was down in it. Luck played a part, but so did support. If some faceless reddit dude who doesn't know how to be concise is a comfortable outlet, I'm around."

People with ADHD go back and forth between deep existential reflection and immediately gratifying hedonistic tendencies - so we need both purpose and to enjoy what we are doing. 

It’s not easy, but try new things and just throw yourself into something before you’re ready, and you’ll learn and adapt, and then reflect on it."

Set realistic goals (behavioral therapy can help a lot with this if you have a good psychologist/psychiatrist!!) And if you shoot for the moon understand that getting there is either luck or a shit ton of boring monotonous work that no one tells you about (Mark Cuban began as a door to door salesman for home PCs and supposedly was terrible at it to begin with, so imagine selling things door to door for months and not being good at it lol)"

For me .... I started asking, what am I supposed to do to succeed? To make enough money?

Then it became, what do I do, to enjoy my life and have respect for myself and what I spend time doing? Am I honoring what I think my own values are?

Then it became .... Okay wtf do I do just so I can actually *thrive* in life ... To want to get up and slog through each day.

Every time the answer is always ""I don't know.""

But in the meantime I've done a million things. Some have stuck. Most have not. Some have imparted lessons or skills. Most have not.

But I haven't stopped moving forward .... Perhaps that's all there is.

I know what I think I want. But I also know that, every moment up till now in my life ... My wants have kept changing.

So why bother continuing to try so hard to say, oh I want to be X. I want to do Y.

I think I will just content myself with Being and Doing... We all return to the beginning anyway and our quest for ultimate meaning is ultimately foolish within a universe experiencing its own truth, it's own meaning for being...

It’s made you want to change.

I like what other people have said, find something that makes your life meaningful and chase that. It doesn’t have to come in the next 5 years or even 10. It probably won’t be a straight line path to meeting that goal but just start living and making mistakes with less regret and you’ll get there"
"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","**Tl;dr - She helped me set vague goals, let me vent, and through venting (about work, family, trauma, etc) she targeted issues that were preventing me from achieving the goals. Being honest with her was key, and I tried stuff she suggested even if it didn't work.**



I went for help with anxiety, depression, and eating disorder-related issues, also suspecting ADHD.



My therapist asked me to set some therapy goals. I had no idea where to start, either. We made them vague: take more calculated risks, hate myself less, have a better relationship with food. Then, I mostly vented during sessions. With her guided questions, we pinpointed things that were preventing me from achieving those goals.



For example, I didn't feel comfortable taking risks because I overthink everything and ended up doing nothing as a result, stagnating, and regretting it. We talked through things in my past that have made me scared of taking even small risks, and worked on self-talk techniques to confront those negative inner thoughts with reason and logic. 



She gives me lots of options to work through stuff. Free writing/stream of consciousness really helped us parse through the constant ADHD brain fuzz to target different issues when I couldn't make sense of them. If she suggests something that doesn't work, I tell her that honestly and we try something else. Ex, she suggested making a very specific time management schedule and my brain did not vibe with that at all. I tried it, told her I hated it, and we shelved it. By figuring out *why* it didn't work for me, I managed to work out a time management technique that DOES work.



A few suggestions for therapy:

- **be honest.** They're not going to judge you. Open up to them. It's hard but they're equipped to help.
- **take their advice sometimes.** Therapy won't be effective if you shoot down all their coping skills without trying them. Even if you think something won't work for you, try it. Just once. Then tell the therapist about your experience and work from there.
- **give it a little time.** Change doesn't happen over night. It's about progress, and sometimes it's hard to see progress while it's happening.
- **fire your therapist.** Aka, find a new one. If you really don't vibe with this one, there are thousands of other great therapists out there. Find the right fit for you."

So many failures have caused me to really close off and socially isolate, so now I don't really have anyone, and I have no idea how to make friends.

It actually really is that simple. The sooner you accept this, the sooner you quit playing victim by accepting a state of victimhood.

And yes, it's playing victim by accepting a state of victimhood. You can look at it in one of two different ways,

1. I have ADHD. Everything is piling up, I don't know what to do, I'm overwhelmed, my relationships keep failing, I lost my job due to performance, I dropped out of school because of my comorbid symptoms, I fight with everyone in my life, I don't know what to do, why did I have to have ADHD, why does everything have to get stacked against me, why is it all so hard, what is the point, I am incapable of doing this.
2. I have ADHD. I know I have disadvantages in comparison to others, but I also have my own advantages to those same others. I need to seek professional help through medications and therapy, and possibly a life coach. I need to not bite off more than I can chew so that I do not get overwhelmed by my responsibilities, so I need to keep in mind my diagnosis and know my limitations. I'll find and work a job that suits me, and I'll make sure to not overwhelm myself with classes. When I find myself being overwhelmed by my emotions, I'll go to my therapist and life coach. I may have ADHD, but ADHD does not run my life, ultimately I am the one in charge and I will stay in charge.

If you suspect you have ADHD, get a diagnosis, get medicated, get treatment. Don't have health insurance? Sign up for ACA. When at the doctor, state you can't make the payment immediately and set up a payment plan/schedule. Take your medicine. Go to therapy. Get a job/go to school. Save all of your money. Move out and live on your own as a self-sufficient adult. Set all of your bills to autopay. Set aside a certain % that you're allowed to spend frivolously so that you can never overspend and miss a bill.

Look, I get it's fucking hard. All of it's hard. It's extra hard if you have a deficiency in the information retention and emotional regulation parts of your brain, as you do with ADHD, for which I also have and wasn't diagnosed until 25 years old. But, you still just HAVE to fucking do it my guys/gals. You have to. No person, especially not the world, is going to wait around for you to realize that ultimately your success relies on you figuring it out - and no one is going to feel sad or bad about you not being able to figure it out except **you**.

This sort advice should bring the complete opposite of what you're stating, if you hear it from a viewpoint as a non-victim. Drop the victim complex. You're all bad asses. Some of you are in school, literal college, with what was once undiagnosed ADHD. Do you know how many kids DON'T go to school because they can't cut it, despite NOT having ADHD? That's an accomplishment, an achievement, not something to feel sad over yourself because you're suddenly now struggling - but rather something to celebrate, ""I have ADHD and refuse to let it hold me back, I may struggle at times, but I'm still here trying to kick this bitch in the teeth"". As for the feeling ""hopeless"", if you're at this stage of victimhood, you've already reached hopelessness. There is no need to be hopeless, as there are so many professionals out there willing to help, so many educational institutions willing to make accommodations to retain you, so many proven drug combinations that can help you function at healthy levels on a daily basis, so many career fields that those with ADHD can hyperfocus within that pay incredibly well.

**You just have to take that first step, yourself, in realizing that ultimately the only thing that is holding you back is yourself and NOT your ADHD - and only then will you be able to work towards that of which you want to achieve.**"
"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","No clue. We probably spent our entire lives developing coping mechanisms subconsciously. Since it was subconscious I have no idea how I managed. 

i just can no longer do things such as follow a recipe step by step, which used to be the one thing I would never fuck up. As long as I could go step by step I was fine. Now I don't notice that I just read step 3 without performing it, and that I skipped steps 5-7 cause I subconsciously read ahead never to return to the step I was at. Or i consider 3 different approaches to a problem, and somehow skip making a choice between them, subconsciously starting the part that I like of each approach, even though they are incompatible. 

This results in massive anxiety cause the harder i try to think ahead to avoid surprises, the more different ideas i have floating around. If I plan a build for a month none of the parts I make go together. It's my private hell"

"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness",">What you *could've* done doesn't really matter, because you can't go back and do it, and dwelling on it will keep you from moving forward and doing what you can now.

I personally don't like this saying, because it doesn't actually give OP energy to change his course. human is a creature that creates an outlook based on their past experience. if their past is full of feelings of unmet potential, then whatever new things they want to try they would instantly anticipate failure and time wasting. So it is an oxymoron 
to tell them to not think about it.

I was also diagnosed in 25, OP. So here's my take: take an incremental approach to whatever plan you have now. try to live a minimalist life and do some handicraft. Your anxiety will easily drag you into materialism; and the later, according to research, helps your mental health and career skill immensely.

DO NOT set yourself up an ordinary person's  standard career goal: ESPECIALLY AVOID watching youtube gurus that talked about how they made it in their late 20's and early 30's. Those are bullshit, self-promoting and meant to give you anxiety so you can buy their online courses. Find real life socialisation and therapists. Reduce social media usage to half an hour if possible. Studies have shown the later will drastically reduce your attention span in the long term and you cannot afford to since you have ADHD.

and lastly, try to pursuade yourself that you didn't waste your time. The world has become too volatile for anyone to predict the future with certainty, not to mention their own life. You are not alone, and don't think others are better planned than you do. They are not."

A neurotypical person would be better able to assess what's doable, then follow through and do it.

Metaphorically speaking, most people select two or three managably-sized portions of various foods from the buffet, carry them back to their seat, then methodically finish them, and go back for seconds if they have room. We eagerly pile -everything- that looks good onto our plates, until the heap is too high to see over and too precarious to balance, then trip on the way back to the table, spill everything, and end up getting nothing to eat at all...and yet we think the problem is that we just should have focused on eating faster!"

This shit is key. My therapist hates the ""think happy thoughts"" shit. Sometimes you need to focus on the bad to get through it, and being saccharine with yourself is unrealistic and unsustainable.

"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","ADHD can really get you into a rut. I can assure you though that the grey box, while it may return at times, isn't permanent. Take note of the small moments where you see glimpses outside of the grey and what made those days special. Eventually you can build a world where there can be more of them. 

I really understand ADHD crushing your self esteem. I have a tendency to self isolate too and am constantly pushing myself out of it. Everyone deserves community and belonging. It can be hard to find, especially when you're older or out of school where community is automatic. But everyone can find it, it just takes time and lots of work for some.

"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","I completely agree about doing something about it, taking actions, getting therapy. That's what I did. That's not what your first comment was coming off as though. It sounded more like ""stop blaming your ADHD and motivation and just do things."" I'm talking about this:

>stop looking for handouts or help and instead look for situations where you can prove yourself to yourself, and simply do what the fuck needs to be done.

Getting therapy **is** getting help. That's not what that comment is telling people to do.

When it was pointed out to me that I might have ADHD, I didn't really believe it and I also couldn't get appointments. I chalked it up as anxiety from some trauma I went through so I figured I'd just try to work around it and force myself to be more diligent with school. Which, again, is what your first comment is suggesting. That led to me breaking down in the middle of finals week because I thought I could just force myself and I wasn't getting anywhere. I get now, that you're saying seek help, but when I read what you said it made me feel like I didn't try hard enough and I was just relying on excuses of ADHD and anxiety to compensate for my failures. When in reality, I was tearing myself apart doing the most I can, not allowing myself to give up. I should have stopped and sought help instead of ""doing what the fuck needs to be done.""

I also definitely think everyone working through this should consider themselves badasses. But you were just calling these same people victims for their struggles. Throughout all of my life, I have never EVER considered myself a victim, but there have been many times where I felt hopeless because I didn't know how I could help myself, despite doing everything I could to try. You suggesting I'm a victim (based on your definition of victimhood) after everything I fought through alone is just offensive. I didn't know until I was 22 that it might be ADHD. It's not like I didn't know what it was, I just didn't think I had it until my sister pointed it out to me. Now with therapy, I'm finally making progress with things. But before knowing, I never thought I was a ""victim,"" just thought I was incapable. I never blamed anything or anyone but myself. Victimhood and feelings of hopelessness **are not** correlated.

My whole point is working hard does not always mean you get progress. Having no progress can make you feel hopeless, but that doesn't mean you're a victim, especially when you've been doing everything you can to the best of your knowledge."

"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","So I'm not an expert but from what I've experienced and read online, your metabolism effects them GREATLY.  For me, I was given Adderall XR.  I would take it at 5:30am, go back to sleep and get up around 7 am as it was starting to work.  Still wired by 9 or 10pm.  My roommate would take Adderall XR and her body would burn through it so fast it was like instant release.

I think most doctors start people on XR because it's 1 pill in the morning and it's not as easy to abuse.  

I told my doctor and she switched me to Vyvanse which is also ""extended release"", but a totally different mechanism of absorption.  It has to be processed in the liver to become active, unlike Adderall XR which is 50% instant release beads, and 50% polymer coated beads that release after the coating is digested.

Unfortunately Vyvanse didn't work for me, so I talked to my doctor and she prescribed two instant release pills per day, which I start tomorrow."
"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","**Some things to keep in mind with meds...** *(with the assumption that you're running ALL of this through your doctor.)*

**TL;DR in bold**

1. **Each medication effects everyone differently** (I tried 6 before finding the right one)

2. **It will take time for your body to adjust** (anywhere from a week to a couple months) 

3. **That doesn't mean you should tolerate really bad side effects!** (But if they're manageable keep taking it for a while and see if they go away)

4. **""Start low and go slow!""** (If you're body reacts strongly to stimulants go back to the lowest dose possible and slowly increase every week or two, as your body adjusts). 

5. **You may not feel any effect on ADHD symptoms right away.** (Especially if you're observing #4, it may take a while to get to an effective dose, but rushing this won't help).

6. **Rebound effect is a thing!** (This is when you're ADHD symptoms come back with a vengeance after the medication wears off. So what's keeping you awake can be NOT having the medication in your system - but again, it's different for everyone).

7. **What you eat/drink can make a HUGE difference in how well the medication works or the side effects you have.** (Esp. true for IR meds. i.e. Vitamin C blocks your body from absorbing the medication, so taking a multivitamin, drinking orange juice, or eating bell peppers... *1 hour Before or After taking your meds* can make the meds not as effective. In the opposite way, NOT having enough protein can make ir meds not last as long, and can cause increased side effects like irritability). 

8. **Don't rely on the physical side effects/feelings to tell you if the medication is working or not** (ask yourself questions like, ""Did I get more done today?"" ""Was it easier to focus on *xyz specific thing* ?"" Even ask someone you trust if they've noticed a difference)"
"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","You can get Ritalin ER (extended release) or LA (long acting) so that you don’t get the roller coaster effect of first dose: productive-then-slump, second dose: productive-then-slump. It fades out more slowly, but is still gone by bedtime.

Edit to add “long acting”"
"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness",Were you on Adderall XR by chance? Normal Adderall that is not extended release usually doesn't last that long and only affected my sleep if I took it too late in the day
"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","I switched to Vyvanse from Adderall and it's been amazing. No anxiety or racing heart. It is XR and was messing with my sleep for a while, so I set an alarm for 1hr before I actually want to wake up, take the pill then go back to bed. By the time I wake up I'm ready to conquer the world, and by 10-11pm I'm well ready for bed.

Best decision I ever made (also 25 btw). Try drinking more water, as it flushes the stuff from your system throughout the day

I upped my dose when I had a very physical manual labor type job last year and felt fine at the end of the day - but now I work at a desk and I can def still feel it when I’m getting in bed at night. I think I’m just sweating and drinking water a lot less, so it’s lingering in my body more now. Thinking of reducing my dosage a little at the next date with the doc"
"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","My body also had a strong reaction when I first started with 10mg Adderall. I didn't feel wired all night, but I sweat through like 5 shirts and my resting BPM was like 100-120 constantly.

I ended up going to 5mg for two weeks and, **slowly but completely, cut out caffeine** to lower my heart rate.

After 2 weeks I could go to 10mg, then 15mg, then 20mg (same side effects came back each time but calmed down a bit after a couple weeks). 

.........................................................................................

It will probably just take time to figure out which med and which dose works best for you. 

For me, it took around 4 months to find the right med, then another 6 months to find the right dose.

It's one of those cases where the solution is simple, but simple =/= easy. 

One thing I've noticed in those around me with ADHD, and nearly all people on here, is that we're great at lateral thinking - but man can this be deconstructive at times. When we're presented with a framework for managing ADHD, at some point we're going to use that thinking skill to point out that all management techniques are ""just do the thing"", and when ""just do the thing"" is demonised, then we can become so good at justifying to ourselves why we shouldn't follow the management techniques etc."

"ADHD ""time blindness"" has caused me to stagnate and waste the first half of my 20s and now I'm filled with regret and hopelessness","RE #7:

This can be a bit more generalized. Acids make things worse, because at least for amphetamine, they cause more of it to be in a water-soluble form and water-solubles *suck* for absorption. The more basic environment you can put them in, the better - it makes them more fat-soluble. Adding onto that fat-solubility, you need fats for them to dissolve into.

Basically: eat breakfast before taking your meds, and not just a bowl of cereal. Eggs, bacon, sausage, whatever, just as long as it's *substantial*. And you don't accompany it with juice or soda (acid!).

Besides, I've found it helps with the side-effect of reduced appetite. Not directly, just so that I don't start feeling like I'm starving when my meds wear off because I've not eaten anything of any particular value all day. And the routine of making breakfast is actually kind of good for me, I think."

I was literally addicted to it. Call it what you will but I was high every day when I took it. For literally years and years and years.

In 1996 I was diagnosed with adhd and put on 25mg of Dexedrine. As a 13 year old. There was no working up to higher doses- and I was essentially overdosing for years and years. Left me with permanent tics, trembling and paranoia along with gastric problems. I literally hallucinated. I was on that till 18 when I was put on adderall till I was 29. 

I’ve been off it since, but as I said, was strongly addicted to it. I know the thing you mean- the withdrawal where you sleep for a week, eat everything in sight and feel like your brain is mush. I defo had that too! 

But a psychiatrist told me I was addicted to it- adderall- I was vulnerable to this for many reasons. I still can picture the high now. 20mg of adderall XR had a devastating effect on me. I knew people who were on 75mg of it and were zombies but it was their prescribed dose. When they went off it was like they’d had a lobotomy. But they weren’t addicted.

Anyone on Dexedrine?,I was on Dex 60 mgs xr and a ir 10 mg booster - I just switched back to adderall cause it wasn’t working as well as normal - I was also in it for 2 years so I had worked up a tolerance I guess I thinks the adderall is weaker personally but I dunno everyone is different
Anyone on Dexedrine?,"Well bro, you are sedating the hell out of yourself by taking the Klonopin and Suboxone together. my advice would be to get off those if you’re trying to take Adderall. It’ll feel more effective.

another thing you can do is start taking magnesium supplements. amphetamines deplete magnesium from the body faster. magnesium is responsible for muscle relaxation and sleep. it also regulates the NMDA receptors in your brain, the same receptors associated with stimulant tolerance. 

taking magnesium while on adderall can make it seem more effective, especially for people who are already magnesium deficient. fun fact, magnesium deficiency is incredibly common with more than 50% of Americans not getting the recommended dietary intake (RDI)"

Dear _________________________,

I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and have come to learn that there is a shortage of the critical medications that allow many of us with this condition to function day-to-day, in large part because the Drug Enforcement Agency has refused to issue the authorizations needed for the manufacturers to increase the production of Adderall and related medications. 

I ask you to inquire into this and, if you find it to be true, to introduce legislation directing the DEA (and, if warranted, the Food and Drug Administration) to immediately issue the necessary authorizations to allow the needed increase in production. 

Thank you for your time and for your attention to this matter. 

Yours respectfully,

I got extremely lucky this month that a random pharmacy had some left over from a patient that use to be on them but no longer is. They only had 10mgs but had enough to fill the equivalent amount for my monthly dosage but said next month they will not have any. This was the 13th pharmacy I had called that day. Every single pharmacy before them told me that they have zero in stock and their suppliers have told them they do not have a date as to when they will have them available to order again.

While the shortage was not as prolonged as the Adderall shortage, it’s not going to be better in the long term to create a shortage for an additional drug instead. 

The real answer is to write to your government representatives demanding change to the current regulation scheme that is still an absolute clusterfuck between both the FDA  and the DEA managing access to our prescriptions. Don’t just write your Senator. Write your Representative and even President Biden. I’ve worked in a statehouse before.

It was a horrible couple of weeks if withdrawal and full blown symptoms coming back and I couldn’t figure out why. I thought I was just getting severely “worse.” Turns out the release mechanics in mydayis are much different than adderall XL and simply were not working on me. 

Finally got a hold of my doctor and she got a hold of the pharmacy. They had to prescribe it like that otherwise they wouldn’t have been able to give it to me at all, and it is the only stimulant they have.

 However, I don't know how they can sleep at night as front line soldiers in the horribly unethical war on drugs. More harm has been done to society keeping drugs behind the counter then by the drugs themselves. The prison system is more harmful to a person then the drugs in most cases, and prison is the only stick used in most cases. This shortage is caused by the state, directly, and pharmacist are agents of the state regardless of if they care to admit it. 

By blocking drugs by demand of the State, they violate every part of their oath. Drug laws are not even constitutional, so they can't even hide behind the cowardly ""legal conduct"" part of the oath.

Legalize all drugs. Yes, even that one."

Pharmacist here. Let's discuss the stimulant shortages and some potential workarounds.,"My dexedrine 15mgs have had 0 issue. I thought I would dislike ER, but I really do not. I do miss my 30mgs of IR, but with the shortage, it makes me feel secure. Also 2x IR would only last me 12hrs total at best. The ER will last more than 16, and it is very tolerable for sleep. 

I would like to try the dexedrine IR, but my dr would only start me at 10mg. I am taking latuda as well, antipsychotics partially block the benefits of stimulants (sadly never mentioned by my psychs which has seeded some mistrust) so I do need the max dose. 

I am trying to restructure my habits, but it is so difficult. Having been so inattentive from around 12yo onward, they are really engrained in me. I had maybe 1 really solid semester of college out of 3 years. Diagnosed 4th semester and medicated halfway through. The meds would work, but meds don't solve everything. I also had other underlying issues which have plagued me.

I'm back on Vyvanse and an SSRI.

No crashes, one pill in the morning lasts the whole working day. 

Mydayis could be a great alt for anyone that can’t get anything else filled. I guess it’s newer and name brand so there’s not a whole lot of discussion on it like other stimulants, but I personally don’t think I’ll go back to Adderall even if the shortage ends sooner than later.

Find a locally owned pharmacy if you can - I find they are more reliable in what they can fill. The insurance you have will affect the price, but with mine and with the manufacturer coupon I’m only paying $30 a month right now."

Shot my heart from 65 resting pulse to 107. Tried it again two more times with partial doses and it seemed to always have to do with water intake. Prodrugs rely too much on variable body chemistry. Hell, I don't even like Adderall XR because I have to wait twiddling my crashing fatigue thumbs for 1.5 hours until the second dose finishes dissolving or whatever it does in there.

Pharmacist here. Let's discuss the stimulant shortages and some potential workarounds.,"LOVE IT, THANK YOU!
Here is my version of the edit if anyone is curious:


Dear ,

I have been diagnosed and treated for ADHD for over 10 years.  Recently, I am greatly suffering from the negative effects that the shortage of the critical medications that allow many of us with this condition to function day-to-day, has caused. A large part of this is due to the Drug Enforcement Agency refusing to issue the authorizations needed for the manufacturers to increase the production of Adderall and related stimulant/non-stimulant medications.

I came to be diagnosed with ADHD because of the chronic and debilitating struggles I’ve encountered in all areas of my life, especially at work. My medication management plan, in combination with weekly therapy, has been life changing for me. Not only has my medication regiment allowed me to thrive and excel in the workplace,  but I am better equipped to contribute more to my community and the world outside of my career. With this prolonged shortage, getting access to my medication has been extremely difficult and has affected both my personal and professional wellbeing tremendously.

I ask you to please inquire into this and, if you find the situation to be congruent with the statements of mine and others, to introduce legislation directing the DEA (and, if warranted, the Food and Drug Administration) to immediately issue the necessary authorizations to allow the needed increase in production.

I greatly appreciate your time and attention to this matter.

Yours respectfully,"

They say it can take up to 48 hours to submit the refill and by then the pharmacy has run out. First come first serve, and now I have a dozen different Adderall prescriptions at different pharmacies that can't be transferred to other pharmacies because it is a controlled substance. 

So now those pharmacies have received regular shipments they are available and I haven't had to call around for 2 months now. I'm lucky, I know it's rough for some. My doctor started calling in 25mg XR and they were in good supply, now they can't get 25s but have 30s."

Pharmacist here. Let's discuss the stimulant shortages and some potential workarounds.,"Adderall XR 40 mg contains 25.1mg of amphetamine base, while Vyvanse 60mg contains 17.7mg of amphetamine base. You've basically been on a 25% dose reduction. To have the right equivalent dose, you'd need to be on 90mg of Vyvanse per day.

Also, because of the amphetamine release mechanism of Vyvanse, you should not feel the ""bumps"" you get from Adderall XR. Just something to consider."

Past 2-3 months, I have been getting hungry during the day and my extremely heavy workload has been like a mountain that I am unable to summit.

I am now relying more on my bursts of autofocus than on my medication."
Pharmacist here. Let's discuss the stimulant shortages and some potential workarounds.,"The dosage equivalency is roughly 3-to-1, maybe 2.5, between adderall and vyvanse, so 40 mg adderall is like 100-120mg of vyvanse."
Pharmacist here. Let's discuss the stimulant shortages and some potential workarounds.,"We shouldn’t see that kind of thing here because we don’t have DEA-style production limits.  As far as I know the regulations on distribution and supply only apply to the US.  Any drugs being produced for international markets are handled differently.  If it was raw materials that were in short supply due to a huge spike in demand then we would have some cause for concern, but there would be consistent descriptions of lack of supply from pharmacies and patients all over the world instead of it being restricted to US.

The only other thing I can think of is people crossing the border to get their prescription refilled.  It could conceivably cause local shortages, but I’m not sure if Canadian pharmacies would fill a controlled substance prescription for a US doctor on a regular basis except in some very limited circumstances, specifically those parts of the US where land access has to go across the border, and access to the rest of the US has to occur by ferry or boat.  There’s two communities I can think of that are like that, one is a chunk of Washington State that can only be accessed by land through BC, and the other is a chunk of Minnesota that has land access through Manitoba.

I’m not sure what kind of import rules would apply to that. I have flown to the US with my own prescriptions and not had any trouble whatsoever, but I was also travelling with only enough medication to cover the trip plus one extra week just in case something unexpected happened, like very bad weather."
Pharmacist here. Let's discuss the stimulant shortages and some potential workarounds.,"We've already experienced them. Im sure there will be more.

However, it was almost unnoticeable to us because our system flags shortages relatively early (ei. ""Expected shortage""), which provides a good amount of time to produce more of the medication before it has a lengthy impact on people. 

For the first time since starting my meds, my local pharmacy could only fill half my dextroamphetamine prescription a couple weeks ago, but they told me their restock would show up in two days and they called me when they had the rest of my prescription ready.

It ends up working very similarly to adderall XR. In other words, after 4 hours, it has pretty much all been released as amphetamine. So it doesn’t really last all day as they advertise. The half life of amphetamine is about 12 hours, so there will still be some left in your blood at the end of the day, but it will probably be below the threshold that it’s very effective. However, you can do “water dosing” (dissolve in water, it’s tasteless except the fillers that don’t dissolve and have a very slight taste) and take 3/4ths of your dose first thing in the morning and the other fourth of your dose 6 or 8 hours later to top off.

Pharmacist here. Let's discuss the stimulant shortages and some potential workarounds.,"I know there are many reasons someone can have high BP, but on the outside chance - do you drink coffee? I was borderline with my BP before meds and when I started track it at home, I’d see it rise and fall. I wasn’t thrilled with the rising, so I started tapering off the caffeine slowly. I’m now below 1/4 caffeinated coffee per cup and my BP is solidly in normal range. It took several weeks but I’m surprised how much of a difference it’s made. 

If you’re drinking any caffeine, maybe it’s worth a shot? Might help get you on track for getting medicated."

However, despite an impending patent expiration later this month, a pediatric exclusivity period will extend Takeda's market exclusivity through August 24, 2023. Only then will the FDA consider approving generic formulations from competing manufacturers.

Same drug that Vyvanse converts into.  If insurance won’t pay for these then good Rx is an option. I take Dex as booster and have only been using insurance for Vyvanse.  Dex I pay w good rx discount.

First, my family and I have a not-so-great medical history. I'm allergic to meat dairy and eggs, as well as some fruits, veggies, etc that aren't as serious as the animal products. The allergy causes an autoimmune reaction, giving me mouth ulcers. 

They also have the autoimmune disease, not sure of the cause, but their symptoms are not near as bad as mine. The Vyvanse would make their ADHD symptoms worse as well as exasperated their autoimmune symptoms. 

Everyone is different. I know people have thrived on the medication. I also know people who didn't have any effect or, like my family, had bad reactions. But since we have the same genes and health problems, I'm going to be cautious with this medication."

Vyvanse is like a dream for me whereas Adderall made me feel like a literal drug addict with needs for higher and higher doses and crashes and all. Really, meds in general can be a genetic crapshoot.

I haven’t been able to find my vyvanse in pharmacies because of people switching. It’s just creating more and more shortages. ALL stimulants are on shortages. Switching just will create a longer shortage for Vyvande when Adderall does NOTHING for some people. So that’s incredibly selfish, as well.

Dear ,

I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and have come learn that there is a shortage of the critical medications that allow many of us with this condition to function day-to-day, in large part because the Drug Enforcement Agency has refused to issue the authorizations needed for the manufacturers to increase the production of Adderall and related medications.

I came to be diagnosed with ADHD because of repetitive struggles I encountered in all areas of my life but especially at work. My medication management plan in combination with therapy has been life changing for me. Not only has it allowed me to thrive in the workplace and excel but with my medication I am better equipped to contribute more to my community and the world. With the shortage, getting access to my medication has been extremely difficult and has affected both my personal and professional wellbeing. 

I ask you to inquire into this and, if you find it to be true, to introduce legislation directing the DEA (and, if warranted, the Food and Drug Administration) to immediately issue the necessary authorizations to allow the needed increase in production.

Thank you for your time and for your attention to this matter.

Yours respectfully,"

Also, the pharmacy chains may have their own Pharmacy Benefit Management (PBM) company, like CVS has Caremark and also owns an insurance company. This increases the profits for both the pharmacy and the PBM, and provides less competition - so it doesn’t benefit patients in the long term.

Pharmacist here. Let's discuss the stimulant shortages and some potential workarounds.,"This was roughly 2 summers ago I believe. This was just months before Arbor made their merger with Azurity Pharmaceuticals. Arbor was the sole manufacturer of all Zenzedi besides their low dose 5mg and 10mg tablets which were being manufactured by their subsidiary company Wilshire Pharmaceuticals. I called Azurity’s main line which is (678) 334-2420… you press “3” at the main menu, and then “3” again which will direct you to patience assistance. At that time nothing was on back order, my pharmacy just couldn’t get it from their wholesalers so a rep was able to send the 20mg prescription I had directly to the pharmacy in my hometown. They responded to me by email and also called me directly the same day I spoke with the patient help line.

I just called them a few minutes ago to see what the status of things were and was told the 20mg Zenzedi is on back order currently and will be back in stock on March 6th. She requested my email and phone number and sent my complaint to a higher up who will be reaching out to me at some time today. 

This is what I would recommend doing if you are having issues finding a way to fill your meds!

- Sidenote- I did find a pharmacy 2 days ago that happened to have a stock of a generic 10mg Dex made by Sunrise Pharmaceuticals. They had a patient who was on this med that longer takes it and had left overs from his last order and had enough on hand to fill my monthly dosage amount… **These generics are garbage** They make me feel tired and just overall “weird” at equivalent dosage, and higher dosage doesn’t feel any stronger. The key factor with name brand Zenzedi is that is has a non active ingredient in them called “Crosprovidone” which aids in the metabolization process of the active ingredient. THIS is what makes name brand Zenzedi far superior to all the generic Dex that is available. Just an fyi in case you have to fill your script with a generic… it will not satisfy the same as Zenzedi (or it’s authorized generic Wilshire brand)

Hope that helps and best of luck !"

Pharmacist here. Let's discuss the stimulant shortages and some potential workarounds.,"Another redditor answered already, but yes, it's a good thing, and will allow more competition. 

Drug companies have 20 years of exclusivity to a drug from date of patent. Which after R&D, trials, and FDA Approval works out to be an average of 10 market years exclusivity. 

Meds that have gone generic tend to be known by their active ingredient, or still the original brand name. 

Examples:

- Tylenol -> Acetaminophen

- Advil -> Ibuprofen 

- Aleve -> Naproxen 

- Claritin -> Wal-itin (Walgreens house brand) 

- Benadryl -> Wal-Dryl (Walgreens house brand) 

- Neosporin -> Triple Antibiotic Ointment

We’re all in this boat together — I had to switch meds myself, and the medication I eventually landed on works very well for me, but it would be silly of me to object to people sharing the fact that it exists with others! Anyone who benefits from one stimulant is likely to benefit from any other one at least somewhat. Most of us have medications which work better for us than others (and some that give us more side-effects or don’t work as well), but we make do with what is available to us until our best/preferred options are readily available again."

Pharmacist here. Let's discuss the stimulant shortages and some potential workarounds.,"It's a great deal ""smoother"" for me than Add xR (which is, in turn, a great deal smoother than IR).

Pharmacist here. Let's discuss the stimulant shortages and some potential workarounds.,"Your dosage is probably too low.  It should last 10-13 hours.   Watch doctor Richard Parker videos on YouTube. He goes into this.  


Both my kid and I are on Vyvanse.  When we started it used to crap out at 2-3 pm.  Adding 10mg pushed out the duration by 2 hours each time.   Once we got to our respective dosages we have most of the day covered"
Pharmacist here. Let's discuss the stimulant shortages and some potential workarounds.,Right? It’s something I can do once in a pinch. I couldn’t do it all the time. And this was after over a month of not being able to get my normal script filled.

Vyvanse works great for me. I don't think I pay more than $10 for it tho, I definitely wouldn't pay $400, or $4800/yr. At those prices I'd have to live with something else.

I do have some sleep issues, but I think that's just my anxiety. It doesn't appear to matter if I go a few days without Vyvanse, sleep is still an issue. That being said, definitely take it early in the day."

My point (in general) was to see if there are pharmacies that work/partner with the manufacturer to see about discounted prices. It's possible the doctor knows that information. We originally tried the manufacturer coupon route but the first pharmacy (main chain) wouldn't honor it because my kid had insurance. 

That being said, I feel like we're always dancing around trying not to sound like drug seekers when trying to find the meds we need. So, I don't have any advice on asking the doctor that question."

Pharmacist here. Let's discuss the stimulant shortages and some potential workarounds.,"Thanks for the tip. My doc started me at 30mg once daily (although that’s way less in strength than the 30mg XR that I was taking before), and I realized it barely worked after a couple days so started taking two of the 30mg of Vyvanse daily. That helped a lot in terms of effectiveness, but it still doesn’t give me as good as a result as my 30mg adderall Xr, plus I think it’s having some negative side effects I don’t have with adderall. So I really just want to get back on my adderall Xr."
Pharmacist here. Let's discuss the stimulant shortages and some potential workarounds.,"Well I started by taking 30mg of
Vyvanse, and it barely did anything, so upped to 60mg. That’s still not enough so I asked my provider to send in a Rx for 70mg, but she says I need to get my BP checked first (ugh - I have had borderline low BP my entire life and am phobic off anything medical even something as simple as a BP reading.

Pharmacist here. Let's discuss the stimulant shortages and some potential workarounds.,For me sleep was fine once I got to the right higher dosage.  It’s the adhd that keeps me awake after meds wear off.  When meds r working I sleep better than on benzos
Pharmacist here. Let's discuss the stimulant shortages and some potential workarounds.,30 mg is a relatively small dose compared to a lot of Vyvanse users. If you take it in the morning  I doubt you’d have an issue at bedtime. My Rx is for 60-70mg and it’s not interfered with my sleep.

Yeah, I used to take weekends off too, but I stopped being able to do that since my kid was born two months ago. An abrupt day off makes me nappy, which I never am, so it can be good if I really need a rest day. I guess this is a withdrawal, but it's not uncomfortable or anything.

Pharmacist here. Let's discuss the stimulant shortages and some potential workarounds.,"This is a question that is best suited for your doctor. I don't recommend trying to figure out the right meds combo on your own, it could be dangerous!   
If you think the current dose of whichever medication you're currently taking isn't quite cutting it, discuss it with your doctor and they should help figure out what's best for you while also keeping you safe! You're welcome to share your thoughts on specific medication combinations with your doc. (I'm sure this doesn't apply to every doctor / patient, for a myriad of reasons - Doctors who don't listen to the needs of their patients, patients who struggle with substance abuse, etc) but most doctors *should* hear you out. That doesn't  necessarily mean they'll agree and prescribe whatever you suggest, but they can use the info you provide to give them a better idea of what you're expecting from the meds and then prescribe accordingly or help you manage expectations in general."

Why is Dexedrine SO DIFFERENT from Vyvanse for me? I don’t understand,Probably because vyvanse metabolizes way different.
Why is Dexedrine SO DIFFERENT from Vyvanse for me? I don’t understand,"The efficacy of Vyvanse depends way more on things like gut health and metabolism than most drugs for ADHD. Either way, tolerance will build up regardless of what drug you're on, and most stimulants have the ability to make you just as sleepy as Vyvanse once it does. Exercise, finding the correct diet for your specific needs, staying hydrated, and all that horrible, monotonous stuff might help the drugs be more efficient. Generally, if it's good for your health, it's good for your stimulants."
Why is Dexedrine SO DIFFERENT from Vyvanse for me? I don’t understand,"Vyvanse hits me pretty hard at first,  but once developing a tolerance it starts to become less noticeable, and I assume that is what has happened to you. That doesn't explain why taking Dex has hit you so hard now even after developing tolerance to Vyvanse, but perhaps the fact that the absorption of it in the body is much more rapid as straight D-amph, it's just much more noticeable to you at once. I much prefer straight Dex IR taken multiple times a day as it feels way smoother to me and the crash is significantly more tolerable than Vyvanse, which feels like my soul is being ripped from my body."
Why is Dexedrine SO DIFFERENT from Vyvanse for me? I don’t understand,"Yeah,  true that must be it. I ended up going down a metabolism and methylation rabbit hole on the internet. (another reason why advanced technology , I swear, has made ADHD much worse for me). I’ve decided I can’t self-fix it sans doing exactly what you say: focusing on good stuff for my body making sure I’m getting essential requirements , exercising, maybe rub one out every once in a while, and so on and so forth. Thank you."

"New SNRI, Dexedrine Not Working?",I take Pristiq and Mydayis/Adderall. I can tell a huge difference on the rare day when I don’t take the Mydayis.
"New SNRI, Dexedrine Not Working?",Following this thread
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"thank you so much for this! i'm learning that medication really only does half the job, a lot of it is also getting myself up to actually do the thing. i thought it was going to be a cure-all and ""fix"" what i thought is wrong with me, but reality hit me pretty hard recently."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"""those first few months are critical to building structures that help your ADHD. Use the time you're feeling better on medication to build good habits.""

Nice!"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"A solid voice of reason. Almost literally anyone feels like a better version of themselves when they're first put on stimulants. That isn't an ADHD thing, that's a How Dopamine Works™ thing.

It's discouraging to see all of the posts about how a person's life has been completely fixed on their first dose, like there's something wrong with us that are resistant or otherwise still struggling.

The posts themselves get a lot of karma, but what we really need is a six, twelve, and twenty four week follow up for those same people. I'd be willing to bet that the vast majority do not hold the same opinion by the end.

The posts are really good PR, and if they're actually true, that's one thing- however I think they set unrealistic expectations for the average person seeking treatment.

Where are all the high karma posts about struggling through therapist after therapist, then getting on meds and still struggling for years until you make some major breakthrough? Or worse, you aren't able to get your shit together, and your marriage and family falls apart?"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I’m so glad I seen this when I did because I start my new medication tomorrow. You’re absolutely right, this is a tool not the solution to all of my problems."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,">those first few months are critical to building structures that help your ADHD. Use the time you're feeling better on medication to build good habits.

I kind of naturally did this when I started my optimal dose. I feel like a completely different person now and it feels so natural. I definitely still have procrastination/time management issues, but when I **do** make it to class, I can actually pay attention. I can take notes. I can *choose* to do my homework. I can read my book and study. I can fully understand the courses that I was told would be ""too difficult"" for me. I wake up early. I go to the gym. I actually eat *more* now and am finally getting to a healthy weight. I can leave the house when I feel the need to go do something like grocery shopping or taking the trash out. 

For the past year and a half I feel like I've been wasting my life away in unproductivity (if that's even a word), so this was more life changing than I thought. It hasn't made me cry, but my brain is definitely happier now."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"This is very good advice and I wish I had known the same thing. I always feel a little weary reading posts with people acting like they have their happy ending and the story is over, happily ever after, because I was like that too (for years, even). 

I've been on prescribed stimulants for a little over a decade now and while I'm sure it might be controversial to talk about here, I can definitely say I'm addicted. I didn't know I was addicted for the first few years because I got that euphoria simply taking my medication as prescribed and I grew too dependent on that. It does wear off inevitably and you'll think your medication isn't working, but if you compare that state where it ""isn't working"" to taking a day or more off cold turkey, you can see that it's still definitely doing something. Neurotypicals don't usually feel that hypomanic drive to do shit and studying boring subjects or doing chores usually isn't supposed to be easy or fun. My doc, when I raised the issue with him of not really feeling it as much anymore, just told me ""take another"" and also suggested against taking days off (which, in hindsight, could have kept my tolerance low and given me an idea of how I'd function off of them). 

Now I'm in a situation where I've really grown used to leaning on that slight euphoria, which I can't really attain because tolerance is through the roof (if I take extras, I just end up running out a week early which sucks). But I'm not in a position to quit and I'm not about to ask to raise my dose even though I have the option because I've dug myself enough of a hole that I'm just going to adjust to that as well. 

What you do when your brain is flooded with dopamine is reinforced a lot more strongly, so IMO it's important to utilize your medication a little more sparingly than you'd like and only for habituating yourself to the things that are most difficult. I mean, I'd still take it almost everyday, but there's no reason to take it if you have nothing to do or if you're just going to browse Reddit and chill. And taking days off here and there really help with keeping tolerance down and giving you perspective. Also, how hydrated you are and how much sleep you got has a big impact on how effective the medication is. Try to get by on less if you can, try to hold off on re-dosing as long as you can (you can usually get a lot more mileage than you think), and try to practice executing habits/difficult things on days with lower doses (or no doses). All of this is less of an issue with extended release, IMO, because you just dose once or twice a day and it's a lot more subtle... But if you're on immediate release (I was prescribed 5mg of Dex 4x a day), be careful with that."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,[removed]
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"1. I can’t emphasize the last sentence of your post enough! Medication is a fantastic treatment, but the best treatment plans are holistic, involving both pharmaceuticals *and* lifestyle changes. Like the golden trio of medication, exercise, and diet change for a type 2 diabetic. Combining ADHD medication, daily exercise, consistent eating habits, and setting up a planner/calendar sticky-note habit has made my life so much easier. My symptoms are still very obvious once my medication wears off, but during the hours my Adderall is active I can get so much done and some of that productivity slips into my evening due to the habits I’ve built. Once you build it, it’s harder to break a habit than people realize. It’s been about 3 months of daily checking my pocket planner and now I check it when I get home even if I know I have nothing to do today or tomorrow lol, it’s build into an automatic reaction to open it up and take a quick look. So I agree so much that the “honeymoon phase” is the best time to start some of the lifestyle changes that will help the most!

2. Just my experience- I didn’t get euphoria, nor have I even as I’ve moved up to 40mg per day total of Adderall IR, but I was moved to tears a couple times over the last month (once I hit 30mg+ per day) due to being able to do mundane tasks that normal people find so easy. So for me, that’s what “This is how normal people feel all the time?!” means when I say it. *”Non-ADHD people can just remember the customer service lady’s name at the end of the conversation?” “Non-ADHD people can just choose to do their homework whenever they realize they need to?” “I didn’t even know people could have less than four active trains of thoughts at one time!!”* That sort of stuff lol. So for some it may moreso be a “I feel great being able to do things that everyone else can do without medication!” statement."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Great advice. I feel similarly to antidepressants. Obviously not all antidepressants work for everyone, but people assume they’re going to cure depression when in reality it is just a tool to build strategies for getting better.

We are all always going to have to work harder to achieve “normalcy” than neurotypicals. Meds don’t fix your disorders, they just give you the boost you need to begin to make healthy changes."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I strongly agree! When I got diagnosed and medicated initially I naively thought that ""oh wow meds work! maybe my life will 100% change for the better now! zoom zoom zoom time to be a NEW ME, i've got this"". Unfortunately things didn't work that way, I've had to struggle so much to learn coping mechanisms, good habits etc., and I still am struggling. The journey never ends."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,This should probably be in the sidebar or something
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I don’t get any euphoria.  I’m on 20 mg Adderall XR.  I thought these doses are too low to give anything like euphoria associated with a recreational dose.  The benefit is only marginal for me, but it’s better than nothing."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Thank you I really needed this post. A balanced one where your experience of ADHD meds aren't a magical 'fix all' bullet but also still help, much like SSRIs are when you first find the right one which helps with anxiety and depression but often doesn't fix it, just helps to better manage it."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"First week of vyvanse I felt like I could destroy this Masters degree I've started. 2 weeks into medication the focus and drive are gone and I'm just feeling side effects like nausea, anxiety, severe distractibility and brain fog. The brain fog has come back worse than before I started meds!"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I really think all those 'first day on meds and I am the happiest I've ever been in my life, I can do anything and everything I want to do, and this is what ADHD treatment does' should be removed for misinformation.

There are plenty of sources saying that your first few days on medication are not likely to be representative of your continued reaction. I see no reason for people to 1, not bother to read all that evidence, or 2, read it but decide that they know better and this sudden new revelation needs to be shared.

It's dangerous, it's lazy, and it shows a worrying inclination to contradict actual scientific consensus with one day's chemically enhanced experience.

If we're not allowed to use the word neurotypical because somewhere in the States it has negative connotations, I'm not sure why everyone is allowed to post 'everything is easy and exciting on meds!' at least once a week."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"My GP, who also diagnosed me, told me that meds are one part of an overall treatment plan. Meds can help, as does therapy, sleep, and exercise. like how getting gastric bypass surgery won't cure obesity... you also need to improve your diet, exercise, and perhaps even therapy if there's underlying mental health issues... They shouldn't be seen as a cure-all, for sure."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"It's also false that people who have ADHD don't get a pleasurable feeling from stimulants. Its just the way the brain works when it gets a massive boost of dopamine, neuropephrine, and serotonin."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,">I do not believe non-ADHD people normally feel this way

I’m not entirely convinced.

I think it’s that people with ADHD have experienced what it’s like to have it for so long that experiencing something that’s close to not having ADHD is like seeing color for the first time. The colorblind person (ADHD person) is like “OH WOW! The sky is blue and blue is such a pretty color!” and the person who has been able to see color all their life (non-ADHD) is like “Yeah… it is blue. wtf is wrong with you?” But they don’t know the pain of living life without color so it’s mundane to them.

But I do agree that things do level out because, eventually, “seeing color” isn’t new anymore. It’s mundane. Eventually they come to say: “Yeah the sky is blue but dishes need to be done so I’m going to go do that…”"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I wish someone had told me just how fucking dangerous they are, especially for an unregulated-brain looking for ever-increasing dopamine and serotonin."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I don't think you're entirely wrong, it's important for people to know that the incredible boost you notice right away doesn't persist forever, and you'll settle into a more moderate, but certainly appreciable level of functionality.

That all said, I think you've swung the pendulum a bit too far the other way. Just as there are plenty of people that don't gain enormous amounts of executive function with treatment, there are those that see very substantial gains that persist. Just within my friend group I have a friend with a very manic case of ADHD that is completely insufferable without his stimulants, despite barely being able to notice this fact himself.

I think the most important takeaway people should have is that everyone responds to stimulants differently, you should try all of the frontline meds at different dosages to determine what works best for you, and to realize that even gaining, arbitrarily, 30-40% more daily function is better than nothing. It's completely normal and okay to not feel like you've just taken NZT."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,That’s because adhd have comorbidities.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,This is probably some of the best advice I've ever seen here.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"My medication still helps after 8 months. My life is considerably better than it used to be and no, I don't feel like I could take over the world anymore, buy I still feel in control of my life. I can stick to routines finally, make better choices most of the time, and people's emotionality doesn't hurt me like it used to.

I consider the long term benefits far more important and life changing. I have so much more going on in my life now. I'm finally starting to access my potential. It's not that I wasn't talented before, but I couldn't stick to anything long enough to see the benefits. Now, I can stay with something for the long term and it means building a better life. Still hard, but not impossible, not crushing like it was before. My faith in my ability is restored because my willpower is there and I'm not scared all the time."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I made a post complaining about this and was heavily downvoted. I comment this on every post about first days on medication and I get heavily downvoted and argued with. This is important. We're setting up people to fail when we have expectations like you mentioned.

I'm glad your post got attention, it deserves it."

What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,[deleted]
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I haven't read all of the comments, but I've wanted to comment this on every single post, especially the ones saying words to the effect of ""this is my first day on meds and I could cry tears of joy."" Yeah, that's because you're high as it's new to your system, all of that while experiencing the therapy of the medication at the same time, which is the only part that is ""supposed' to be a part of the treatment. 

The happiness and contentment and satisfaction with life will come if you put the work in that the meds will help you complete. The euphoria can be dangerous if you don't understand that you're not gonna experience that every time you take it. I still get euphoria every once in a while with my meds, but that's typically if I'm taking care of myself diligently, not because I'm needing to up my dose.

Great post, OP."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,This is actually quite discouraging for me. First few days on 5m Adderall IR was great. I was energized and focused. My speech was clearer. Little to no anxiety. Then switched to ER and it didn’t work as well. Got anxiety pretty bad. Switched back to IR but twice a day. That was today. I don’t feel like I did before. It’s been over a week and I want that energized and focused feeling back. Now your saying I won’t?  If it doesn’t then wtf am I taking them?  How is therapy gonna help me stay awake during the day and motivate me to do anything?  What am I supposed to do?
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"This 100%! The medication is wonderful, the euphoria is too, and when it subsides the medication & your coping skills still do help tremendously."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Thank you for the tips. I’m about two weeks in and started realizing that I only have a small window of time where I can do things efficiently and the rest of the day is the same as before. I know  I need to put things in place to become habits.

I just don’t know how to do it though when basically all my medicated hours are at work. Like it’s making me do great at my job, but the rest of my life is still sucking."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"as someone who just started meds last month, THANK YOU for taking the time to write this out. Accountability is hard, and the medication itself will not fix my life. I really needed this post, thank you 😭"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I'm now realizing that, in hindsight, while my presentation was entirely, entirely textbook: gifted program in grade school (somehow having ADHD doesn't quite feel *twice exceptional*), got through high school, didn't finish college.

So, typical.

But what really, really messed me up, again in hindsight, was having a dad who could only yell, berating me when I couldn't perform to his standards, and in turning to mom for comfort (a womam who self-describes as ""stoic"" & ""Germanic"") all she could do was tell me to say ""I'm alright.""

Pop quiz: what do they both have in common?

Neither one knew how to express, nor handle, their own feelings--let alone those of their little, introverted, combined type boy.

I was raised by undiagnosed/untreated ADHD parents. <--this didn't gel for until I got in to see the psychiatrist. I mean I can't say this for sure, or diagnose my parents, but like the Magic 8-Ball: ""All signs...""

Tl;dr: Like my psychiatrist says, ""The only FDA-appeoved, scienctifitally tested method for treating ADHD is therapy and medication.""

While medication can help us function by either leveling out, or raising, neurotransmitter levels to *normal*, or nominal, levels.

And only therapy and/or coaching can help us undo a lifetime of maladaptive, and subsequently build new, healthy coping mechanisms and positive self-talk.

So it's both/and--because meds aren't a panacea, and they don't teach new life skills, while therapy doesn't really do anything for neurotransmitter levels (I mean one can still have a healthier frame of mind still being time blind as heck).

So both/and.

Great post, OP! You inspired my response."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,[deleted]
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"For me it’s been kind of like when I had lasik eye surgery. I was very blind (-6.5 right eye, -7.5 left eye; if that means anything to you). Suddenly, I could see in 4K out of my own eyeballs!?!?! Whaa…. It was so unbelievably different, amazing, life changing. I never understood how people could just walk around unaided and see clearly more than 3” in front of their face. It’s been 2 years, and 20/20 just feels normal now. 

I’m coming up on 8 months of stimulants. I’m not aware of it “kicking in” anymore. The novelty has worn off. But my adhd symptoms are in check. I’m still feeling capable and grateful.

We should let people have their day in the sun, and relish that feeling of new found control and clarity. They come here because a lot of us will understand. Other people in my life didn’t understand because they didn’t understand how it was for me before."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I’ve said it once and I’ll say it again. Medication is the gas, but you still have to drive the car to the destination. You still have to decide where you want to go, remember the directions to get there, deal with traffic. 
You also still have to do regular maintenance on the car to make sure it runs smoother. Because if you haven’t changed your oil in a year it won’t be as fuel efficient. However it’s easier to get your car to an oil shop when you have gas in the tank"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Agreed. I’ve been on meds since May last year and have a long way to go. 

I’ve lost two jobs in this time due to symptoms and am currently struggling to keep my current one. Meds have helped my day to day executive function, like self care. I am happier but it’s mostly my inner world that’s improved. Like others, getting diagnosed as an adult means usually means there’s debilitating aspects that will take a hell of a lot of work. Having comorbidities, I still don’t know if I’ll ever be able to work full time. 

There’s hope, of course. The one thing people don’t talk about much with psych meds is the sustainability aspect. Nothing is a switch"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Yes, yes, yes. ""First day"" posts gave me unrealistic expectations. Meds are helping me a little, but it's been no magic bullet, and it certainly hasn't helped me with my emotional regulation. Therapy, exercise, sleep, nutrition... a holistic approach is best, imo."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I've been on meds for 3 years, at the same low dose. Perhaps it was euphoria for you. Personally I had a 'wow' moment at finally having plain old executive functioning and just magically remembering things like my keys and being able to hold a train of thought. It's still like that, and I still sometimes wonder at how I used to manage.I saw a coach prior, and I wasn't really able to implement much until medication. Obviously you still need to put effort in, and it's not a magic bullet. But that seems like confounding another issue entirely. No amount of coaching helped with the memory issues. Starting meds was kind of a wow moment. Not because of euphoria. But because managing everyday tasks used to take so much effort, and now they just come naturally. My partner had the same experience after getting a cpap for his sleep apnea and finally getting sleep. Executive functioning is neato."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"If medication feels like I no longer does anything, at least to any helpful degree, definitely ask about getting a slightly higher dosage."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I kinda expected Vyvanse to fix a lot of things for me. Now it's just presenting me with the 'next stage' of problems that I'm only now capable of seeing or dealing with.


It's been 5 months now. Most of that time was spent in titration working out the right dose that wasn't too low (anxious & crash in the afternoon) or wasn't too high (unable to sleep longer than 2 hours, nervous all day). 


Then came working out its many subtle interactions and needs from the body. Certain supplements unexpectedly enhanced its effect, protein also gives it a long term boost, and I find glucose essential as stimulants are draining on the body. So all of that was a wild ride too.

But lastly...it hasn't fixed much, except cleared my head and given me an occasionally better memory. I can turn myself to chores easier, but the executive dysfunction is still there for things like studying. My biggest hurdle so far is finding resources on learning skills to overcome things like ED now that I'm in a more capable mind on vyvanse, beyond just advice like ""separate your tasks"" and ""write a schedule""."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"For adults diagnosed with ADHD, behavior modification should be part of the treatment. Years of masking symptoms leaves us with pretty bad habits. What I have found out is that medication does work but.. it should not create too much hyper focus or any euphoria. I should feel normal with one major difference. I can actually start things. Unless someone noted  things down what we did before and after starting meds it is very hard to quantify in a few weeks if the meds have failed. The first thing people on meds should try is not taking out the trash, doing the dishes, paying the bills etc., but all those things yet in an organized fashion. Most of us on ADHD have issues with structure in our life. I believe with the meds it is possible to do it to learn the structure that we have been missing in our life."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"That's the ticket right there my therapist is trying to make me do this, there is no magic pill"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I totally feel this! after taking stimulants for the last couple months, I've been working with my therapist to in creating better habits and with my meds it's been a lot more manageable in remembering and keeping a better routine. Literally I lose my keys wallet and watch on a daily basis but I now have designated spots for each both at work and at home and I haven't lost any important items for like 2 weeks now! The hardest part for me was following through with little changes like this but my meds have helped!

I also started to meal prep, I didn't go all out and do the whole week cause that's so overwhelming. I just  started with 2 meals a week, and then have easy go to snacks for the rest.

The next thing I've been working on with my therapist is organizing a calendar so I don't miss appointments, get to work on time and reminders of when my bills are due. I use a GIANT paper calendar pad i found on amazon and put up on my wall. It's helped so much!!

Small changes over time while practicing follow baby!"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,">raving about their first day \[...\] especially after years of taking medication \[...\] those first few months are critical

Let me understand what you're saying... 

At first there's Euphoria that *'finally, i'm doing this. Thank god it was just my beep adhd brain that was holding me back'* etc. This goes away after 1-2 weeks. It's like falling in love or buying a new smartphone.

Then you've got the normal phase which is great for the first say \~6 months but it slowly fades out as the body gets used to the medication? Then you slowly realise that it wasnt just your *beep* *adhd* brain and that the medications help a little bit (say 30-50%) but you still need to do the work.

Soooo, the first \~6 months and maybe couple of years are key to building the habbits, doing cbt etc and generally you still need to try like everyone else does. Yes?

/

I was diagnosed with adhd (pi) like a week ago, am in my early 40s and am exploring what my options are. What are their various possible possitives, negatives etc."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Yes! My biggest worry is that I missed the window of being new to medication to make positive routines and strengthen good neural pathways and instead sort of just followed the dopamine because doing everything felt so good on the medication. 

It’s challenging now because in someways the medications makes the adhd worse, I am more impulsive with the things I want to do and struggle more so transitioning from task to task if im really enjoying somethings 

But having more dopamine in my brain, Im able to just “do things” when i have to and I feel less frozen in executive dysfunction so it’s made the adhd better in that way.

still working out proper dosage and proper meds but i wish those first few days on ritalin I really started making positive routines instead of just trying everything and reading a book in one day. Im on biphentin now because coming down from the medication was really hard for me and i would become totally useless and wasn’t having issues with sleep. i wanna maybe try a diff one because they’re both methylphenidate."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"How do folks know when to switch meds? My adderall XR gave me way too many physical  and uncomfortable side effects. IR Adderall is better, but trying to determine if I want to try something else…"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Cool now I have a new excuse for delaying starting medication.. it’s called: “what if I start taking them and waste their potential without building good habits? Gotta plan first then take them”

Aka “gonna swim in an endless possibilities of stuff I must consider and prepare while delaying meds forever”"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"My wife: ""I thought the meds were going to help--why are you still such a disaster?""

Me: ""They help a lot, but they don't magically undo 46 years of bad habits""

&#x200B;

I am looking for a good therapist to help with that part. But I keep putting it off (OF COURSE)."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,I started taking 18mg of concerta a week ago and I have like zero euphoria and im feeling the same as without meds. Instead I have daily headache lmao
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"This is so so very true and exactly what I have been going through the past year after my first year being pretty much easy sailing. I used to just take my meds and wait about 30 minutes for them to ""force"" me to do something. That stopped working and I started to go down hill again. So now I have to set a good schedule, force myself out of bed in the morning, and realize I have to do certain things that I don't want to do or have great motivation for right then."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I wish Adderall worked the way it does the first day. I felt like I was super human. I could concentrate perfectly and task switch with ease. There was no task resistance at all. 

It's still life changing but nothing like that first day."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I made a post complaining about this and was heavily downvoted. I comment this on every post about first days on medication and I get heavily downvoted and argued with. This is important. We're setting up people to fail when we have expectations like you mentioned.

I'm glad your post got attention, it deserves it."

What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"My sister was recently diagnosed and started medication. I suspect I have add but haven't had an assessment.
She started medication and hasn't felt a change. She was warned that she will probably need SEVERAL adjustments to the meds before something really worked for her.
I'm glad many people receive relief on the day they start medication but that's not true for everyone. Hopefully those who are not so fortunate have a psychiatrist who is there to give them a realistic understanding of medication."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Here is what i found:  


* **first days/week:** Amazing! Incredible! I can focus! My career/personal life is saved!
* **next few months:** Wait this hasn't fixed my other issues it isn't a magic bullet omg life is awful I'm so upset (also headaches) what even is the point (some readjustment of dose here too)
* **now:** The meds don't magically fix everything but they make the Wall of Awful that makes it hard to do things easier to jump over making life in general just a bit more manageable. I still need to have other systems in place and there for sure are times where it is still harder to function, but I seem to be starting at more of the same base line as others, instead of having to fight to get to that baseline"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I took adderall 10 mg XR and while it helps me focus the effects of intrusive thoughts and hallucinations are rather terrible.

I couldn’t sleep until 20 hours after taking the dose.
29 hours later and I still feel it and feel irritable and fatigued.

With my ocd it’s been very stressful and I regret taking it."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,Yes! This narrative needs to be publicized more. I’ve seen my fill of Toks where people are crying for joy (literally) the first time they tried their meds. This is glamorizing the first day and doesn’t give people a realistic or whole picture of life on adhd stimulants.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"even though I've now mostly finished the titration process, this is really the post I needed to see. When I started on ADHD medication, I thought nothing was working because I didn't have this euphoric life-changing experience. In fact, I didn't even notice anything! 

But it WAS working. It just needed to be coupled with other strategies. For me, it makes it a little easier to start tasks and makes it easier to focus once I've started. So it's still up to me to start the task, to keep track of what needs done, and since I'm a student, it's up to me to go to class and find good environments that'll help me study (instead of staying in bed). 

Just wanted to comment this to thank you for the post, and just on the off chance that someone who feels similar to me might see this and feel a bit better :)"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"The first day I medication I read a whole A4 page of paper without intruding thoughts. That was the one big thing I remember, from my understanding this is a normal person thing? Was I high?"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I’ve been on vyvanse for 6 years now and am currently on 50mg. I am lost on what to do. It is not working anymore for me, I’m back to feeling overwhelmed by the most simple things, like making a phone call, finishing assignments etc. I am constantly stuck wanting to do things and just can’t. I tried Adderal XR and it was no difference. Is it time to switch to an instant release? I just don’t know where to go from here."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,The real changes in way of thinking have been long term for me.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"The first day, my brain shut up for the first time in my life. I was in control of my thoughts. I could experience mental silence *when I wanted to*.

It was only that one day. Now I can just… do things. My thoughts are still going a mile and minute and lord help me if I get focused on the wrong thing when the meds kick in as opposed to all the productive things I wanted to get done. But hey, at least I was doing something other than being bored, unmotivated, and couldn’t even be bothered to find someone on YouTube for background noise to my apathetic life."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"adhd is like running a race on a track but only one lane has hurdles. The medication doesn’t make you any faster or remove the hurdles, it just lets you realize you don’t have to run in the lane with the hurdles anymore. And because you’ve been doing all that extra work all along you might be pretty amazed at how well you perform without all this hurdles"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"That's good to know. When I first started I found myself very productive and it wore off after a few months. I thought I just got used to the meds and might need a higher dose. 

But it just stopped working completely. I tried to keep taking them, but then found it didn't help. So I stopped, thinking my body would readjust after a break and they'd work again. 

But I stopped completely for over a year and when I started taking it again, still doesn't work. 

Now I'm wondering if I should just try taking it every day, whether or not I think it works, and see if that helps..."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"great point about habits. 

i still take stimulants almost every day but typically only about 1/4 of what is prescribed. it helps me get some momentum in the morning which will last most of the day. i have noticed that ive built some great habits like getting chores done without putting too much thought into it."

What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Thank you, I need this right now in my life."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Indeed! There’s no medication in the world that will get me out of bed, change and leave home at 7am for a run. It’s a lot of willpower and resilience, assisted by meds."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,thank you. i started adderall a month ago and i’ve been feeling a bit better but i’ve been really upset that I haven’t had any of those brain clarity moment that everyone raves about
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I am at the maximum dose of instant release Adderall. It does so little for me after years of being on the same dose. I basically take it to get out of bed at this point. I've had ADHD all of my life and I can attest that medication alone isn't the answer. 

The worse part is having the confidence to know that you are financially stable enough to take that drug vacation. I worry and feel selfish that this is an eventual reality. My family is going to see and deal with a piece of silly putty stuck to a Sunday paper for a few weeks."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I absolutely agree to you. I have started with habits when I was suspicious about having ADHD and before being diagnosed. Some days were bad and I was not able do anything anyway, but in year, while waiting for diagnosis, I have changed my life. Or at least I have turned it 90°"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I started Adderall xr this week and was really hoping for that feeling everyone described. It's done nothing for me. I got the dry mouth and appetite loss side effects but; as I described it to my friends and family it makes me feel drowsy without the sleepiness. I don't know how I will describe it properly to my doctor but I feel lame. Basic. Mostly after it wore off I realized I had felt that way, comparatively. But it did nothing helpful.  If anything I was more locked into my phone, changing activities was if anything more difficult, I was actually *less* productive on it. 

I should probably make this it's own post, but has *anyone* had a similar reaction/experience?"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I'm confused, I just take them for the focus and mental quiet. Don't they keep giving you that?"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,For like the first week that I started taking Adderall XR I legitimately felt happy again and it was such a nice feeling but after that week of taking it I started to feel like how I do normally but with only the ability to be productive and literally 1/10th of that feeling of happiness I initially got.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Realize that medication is not the solution to your ADHD. It's a combination of building discipline, habits, healthy ways of life, medication, therapy and emotional resillience."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,Is it ok to just save meds for days that are extra bad? It seems like a couple of days on can help me sort out a lot of my life and it takes a while for things to get super bad again. I don't like being altered all the time even if it feels better it just feels wrong.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,They also never mention rebound or side effects like increased anxiety or depression.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"This post is really important, thank you for this. I'm looking into getting meds for the first time and have an appointment in March. The post you've mentioned created a lot of confusion for me and this is really helpful. <3"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,I just want to be able to think. Once thats possible I’ll take care of the rest.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"2 weeks into meds, definitely helping in a lot of ways but seems / feels like it's more of a 'you now have the ability to do x,y,z - go do it'.

As if it now helps you be able to do the tips in here easier: https://old.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/ioi1my/i_went_through_700_reddit_comments_and_collected/

But you still have to do them. 

But hey much better than before so all good!

Positive is that rather than using meds to 'force' your mind to fit in with your current lifestyle (say office work / internet distractions', it 'forces' you to re-evaluate and make positive changes (such as reducing internet distractions, changing job etc)."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"well, if I'm ever able to get to the point of being prescribed stimulants, the life changing thing that I'm expecting is to be able to remember to brush my teeth every day, multiple times a day if possible."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,I would love to get medication - have heard so much good stuff about it - but it would prejudice my firearms license. Weirdly they prefer me unmedicated than medicated.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,[removed]
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,This is excellent advice! I haven’t been medicated for my ADHD in years but many of the good habits I built when I was medicated have stuck with me.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Muchos gracias for the needed perspective, I’ve recently been realising perhaps I might not be as ok as I thought I was, I think medication can be useful to help reveal that and give a change of perspective."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,Been taking for 4 years and still get euphoria
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Yes. My kids pediatrician stresses that stimulants won’t make kids smarter and shouldn’t change their personality. It just gives them a slight delay to process their actions before doing them. “I need to get up and go look out the window… no wait I’m taking a test I need to finish this test”

And while taking the medication it helps train them in appropriate behaviors and coping mechanisms."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I agree and I think those posts should be banned. It creates a false narrative on the temporary euphoric/manic state that happens when introducing stimulants. I agree while stimulants don’t create good habits, they do make it easier to begin better habits. It helps with the executive dysfunction of not being able to."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,Yes. Recently started meds and feelin almost super human. Started getting kinda lazy with my organization and lists etc. Started catching up quick. Meds are only part of what i need. I have to keep my end up too (and as we all know that can be the hardest part).
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"It definitely depends on the meds too. Adderall was life changing to me, but when my body got used to it and I was falling asleep at 3pm every day, we decided to swap to Ritalin just to compare and I basically lost two weeks of my life cuz I couldn't stay awake at all.  If I'd started with Ritalin and had that sleepiness reaction, I probably would have had a much more sour feeling about my treatment."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I just recently got back on mine after a relatively long insurance related break, which reminds me I need to make that payment, and while it is great to be back on them, there have been some new, unpleasant side-effects. Weight loss is great, but I can hardly eat. I've been having weird sleep related issues. Like, even if I take half a dose in the morning, by the time I get home at 11:00PM, I'll be totally exhausted. I'll stay up for maybe a couple of hours, and fall asleep. By 3:00AM, I'm back up, and wired. It takes hours to get back to sleep. Then the day before yesterday, I got incredibly nauseous halfway through work, I was tired, my head was in a fog, and I started puking uncontrollably. I chalked it up to just not really eating much, and maybe low blood sugar. So, yesterday, after another night of awful sleep, I didn't take it, and just went and got some food. I could barely finish it, and still felt terrible. I thought at that point that it was a lack of sleep, but I still couldn't get back to bed. At that point, I took a Xanax, and got a couple of non-consecutive hours throughout the day. That turned out to be a bad idea, because I got put on the morning shift for today. After giving up on trying to sleep around 5:00, I went about my day. I fell asleep around 10:00 for maybe an hour, and couldn't get back at all. 

All that said, life without the meds is objectively worse. 

I know it will all even out, but this sucks. I'm at work, exhausted, and just want to go home, and go to bed. Thankfully, the nausea, and light headedness haven't returned yet."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,My first day on meds was incredibly dissapointing after reading all these people talking about how amazing it was for them. On the first day I felt marginally better at best. The following days I just felt like pure shit. I’m only a month into my medication journey and still trying to find what works so hopefully soon things will start getting better
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"When i first started my medication, i passed out in that week lol

(I dont think my meds caused that btw)

Also thank you for making this post bc i wish somebody told me to do this and even now i wish i was told to it, i am now going to go make a meal plan"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I'd like to add to this. I realised after a while that meds really only help with external impulses. I.e you won't be distracted as much by sound, movement, etc. But it doesn't help much with internal impulses.   
So you'll still have to work on the latter if you want real sustainable improvement.   
Meds are great, but not a silver bullet."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I think two or three weeks later is a more accurate time frame to feel 'normal' that being said, meds are still pretty life changing for me anyway"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Hope this post does not gets burried under all responses but I need to get this out so here we go.

Today is actually my first day on meds. Since my diagnoses of inattentive type ADHD in december I thought about medication a lot and seen a lot of succes stories on this sub. 

I used to be semi-functioning meaning I held down a job and a relationship for a really long period. On the surface nobody would notice my struggle but it was there. Mainly with motivation / starting tasks and finishing bigger task which for a desk job are kind of important  (I mean this semi-jokingly because duh it's important) 

Now my feeling today: I took 36 mg of extended release Methylphenidate this morning around 8:30. I had quite a busy morning doing regular weekend tasks. I felt a slight ' high'  feeling in my head but nothing world-changing. 

Around 1 pm I had some time to catch up on work because my son  went to bed and now I have been killing a task that has been on my desk for DAYS which I have been working on for days as well. There was progress but in my normal tempo ( lot of distractions; surfing sites, getting coffee / other drinks, getting food, going to the toilet and even some games) . AND BOY WHAT A DIFFERENCE. 

I have been working really focused on the taks without even trying to look for distractions. They sources of distractions are here but they just don't interest me that much. I now don't enjoy the distractions because I know they have impact on my work in the coming week / weeks. The distractions will just have to wait until I choose to look at them. 

This does put it in perspective and I hope I can keep at least some of this improvement because I feel so freaking good. It has been a long time ago I have been so proud of myself for something so easy. 

TLDR; first day of medication and I feel better than fantastic. This does put it in perspective and thanks OP for reminding me that it doesn't end here. 

Stray strong people."

I am the same person and I have the same problems, they're not gone but they are mitigated.  Since getting on the right dose I've applied for a union job (union union union!), interviewed for that job, started being able to cook dinner semi-regularly and I feel less like screaming all of the time.  Life is easi*er* but it's not just straight up easy.  

&#x200B;

Honestly though did anyone else feel a distinct drop in their baseline fear after starting meds?   It's like I recently realized no one can actually hit me at work and it's made a world of difference."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I’ve noticed after being on mine for almost two years it just aids me. Like when I get myself to do things where my executive dysfunction would’ve prevented me before so, my brain seems really unhappy? It doesn’t like doing tasks it doesn’t have the motivation to do.

I also noticed that some days my meds don’t work at all. I’ll be really spacey, fidgety, loud and impulsive. My meds never make those symptoms go away, but some days I just can’t control them.

ESPECIALLY GETTING TIRED BECAUSE IM BORED oml. I also still struggle to focus on reading plain text that’s all one font type and size with no variation."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I just started stims (was already on Wellbutrin) and sadly it made me feel really disconnected and out of it. So I stopped taking them after like 4 days. 

Anyone else have a similar problem?"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Meds break the negative cycle.  You need to start building good habits and routines to really stay afloat.  Just taking meds won't ""fix"" you.  Meds are good though!"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Medication isn't a solution, it's a tool. Life is still hard and habits are still deeply entrenched, but it's a good tool to start making changes."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,I never got that euphoria. My medication was raised to the correct dose progressively. All I felt was less and less fog. Maybe more energy from not constantly trying to keep up in class after zoning out for 20 minutes.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Agreed, the first week in Vyvanse was super nice but now it just feels like my new normal. Which is still nice since it helps immensely during my job not getting overwhelmed like I used to but yeah realistic expectations"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I honestly am not sure if the first few days were just a placebo affect or they were helping. Like am I noticing I’m off track and redirecting myself because I’m monitoring myself more closely, or is that the drugs? Both? Who knows? 


Is that still happening? Not really."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Yup, I still have days I struggle to concentrate, and I still forget where I put shit.  But they are much less frequent and severe than pre-med.  Definitely had a bit of euphoria at the start as this new normal came in, but it definitely didn’t last."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Hi, 
Long ago in elementary school I was diagnosed ADHD and went thru a series of drug trials first with ridilin than adderall. 
I took this medication for many years and struggled with my add but eventually also sleep and appetite. My friends would beg me to not take my pill in the morning so I'd be ""more fun"" and not a jaw grinding zombie. 
After high school I said ""fuck you"" to the meds and went about my merry life however began to struggle immensely in my work life. It wasn't until I began eating super clean, getting enough sleep, proper vitamins and exercise that I realized I didn't need medication to feel ""normal"" and focused, I needed routine and heath practices.
I wish I'd learned this sooner and OP I couldn't  agree more those first months are crucial! Take the meds but build different habits that you can stick to and are dopamine rewarding to make lasting changes! Do things for your dopamine people the drug dissent fix you, infact no one is going to save you but you!"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Might I add: trying to balance out the medication with your needs, and with the negative side effects too. I need a higher dose of the meds, though it’s too high for me to do any sort of cardio without my heart rate reaching astronomical levels :/ it be like that sometimes, I’m afraid"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I never got the euphoria.
I think stimulants do nothing for me mostly"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I'm  on stimulants but it is not helping my procrastination problem. 
However i am better with people when on meds. Just argue less, and more often know when to stop talking. Also meds helping me with sleep."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"100%. Started taking meds at 32 in December. Insane results right away, though it has definitely leveled out now. I still struggle sometimes to get stuff done, but I am not always searching for those dopamine hits in other, usually destructive ways."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I don't know. There is a lot of truth in what you said but I cannot agree on the ""non-adhd people don't feel like this every single day"".

Yes, the first week is something more, the change is dramatic and the memory of how you are without medication is nothing but the sum of your entire existence.

That is not to say though that the following weeks need to be much different or much less efficient. Most people, myself included experience a drastic decline in the efficiency of the medication at some point, and they attribute it to a number of different things. In the end though they don't really know why the drop occurs or if it should occur. Unless you have an amazing doctor, you won't ever find out either. 

What I am saying is there is no evidence besides anecdotes to point to the fact that we shouldn't constantly be feeling almost like the first week (superpower discovery euphoria and excitement aside) . My own experience indicates that the same potency is achievable, when you really get to know how the meds work, what they interact with, how sensitive you are to them, how they are metabolised, the exact dose you need to reach that state, etc. 

It is simply way more complicated than most people come to know, and far more than 99% of doctors will have the knowledge to teach you or take the time to deal with. That doesn't mean the optimal effect does not exist past the first week, merely that most people don't know how to reach it. For example, long-term tolerance is not supported by evidence with these meds. Yet most people think they have built tolerance to them.

Steady state concentration, half-lifes, urinary ph, gastric PH, sensitivity to medication, food and drug interactions, time of ingestion and even brand specific differences to fillers - are only some of the factors that might change nearly everyday in your life. All of these will more or less affect how the medication works. These pills don't work in a vacuum.

For me, through my journey with medication, the more I come to understand all the above factors, the closer I have come to feeling like day 1 again. And on some rare days, I get the exact same feeling I had 2 hours after taking my first ever Vyvanse pill, if only for 30 minutes. It reminds me that it's nothing to do with tolerance or the amount of time I've been medicating for. It's simply a bit more complicated than taking the same amount of medication every single day, and expecting the same results - when so many other things that affect those results constantly change."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,Thank you I really needed to see this 🙏
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Tried 2 meds for adhd so far. First one gave me a ”inner calm” removed leg shake and so on. Not much for the world but a big difference for me. The other one made me feel like my blood boiled and I was really mad about a thing (not a small thing but still) for a week. I told the nurse if they invrease the strength on that one, I’ll rip put the window and fly away.
So I went back to first one. Did it solve everything or anything for me? It does help to focus on one thing. But ofc I still have symtoms. My knowledge about adhd and my diagnosis have done more than any med could do. I’m still learning how and what makes me tick. But its like now I got a manual. 

Sry for bad english, meds should also be ”out of my system” at this point."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I would really appreciate advice on how to incorporate exercise into my day. Before medication I would do so much, but given that its not recommended to do it while taking ive literally stopped!"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,when i first took it it made me really sleepy and i thought i was given a placebo or something
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Thank you for this! I'm talking to our family doctor tomorrow about getting me on meds for my ADHD, and i've been looking for information like this that will help me figure out the new me."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I did just think that meds were all I needed, then a year later when I started college I had to get a TON of help to not drop out"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Yup, totally agree. It’s weird to be excited to be on medication. After a while it burnt me out and realized it can be damaging. First time I tried it I fell asleep lol also you can be hyper focused on a task that you don’t want to while being on medication. It’s always a conscious choice to try and do better."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I can't take stimulants consistently. They keep telling me that it's what I need. I feel great when I take them, but I get so angry in the evening. Like my anger is unreal and uncontrollable. I get mad at myself for being so angry, but I can't change it so I stop after 2-3 days. I've tried changing my dosage, different meds/brands. They all do the same thing."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"And if you fail, take a little tolerance break and try again?"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I’ve been downvoted for saying this, but you put it a lot more eloquently. I recently stopped taking stims because I actually started feeling awful on them.

I avoid a lot more work now, but I’m happier. I think."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I just started adderall last week and the biggest plus for me has been impulse control. I'm not dopamine chasing. I'm also not eating, which I've got to keep an eye on. But like, I could definitely lose some weight at 300lbs. Otherwise though, I've been on top of all my tasks without any of the euphoria stuff. I really hope this medication stays this effective with me. It's even fixing my sleep schedule slowly."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,My therapist put it like “meds are like shoes to help you walk/run…but you still have to practice walking and running to get better”. Reading about different ideas and ways to help and therapy at the beginning can be helpful. Good books include anything from Dr. Barkley imo also I’m NAD
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Very good points raised here. I started meds at 38, as such I already had routines in place to help me function. Because of my routines, the meds have been a god send add they really helped me to refine them and stick to them. All the symptoms are still there, I just have better control. It's so easy to let them run wild, but ultimately I am in control.... for the first six hours of every day."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Yes, coping strategies are half of it . Also, all meds have side effects Long term, even at the right dose ."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I definitely agree. Medication is just a helper. I just feel like I have more spoons when I take my meds. I can make more decisions and it clears my brain fog.

 You still have to run the bases, it just helps you keep going in the right direction, instead of getting to second base and forgetting what you were gonna do next.

I didn’t take my meds for a couple days this week & i felt more sensitive to noise, i had more trouble prioritizing and therefor completing tasks, and had more executive dysfunction."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"100 percent. I’m about 6 months into medication, and had the same first initial thoughts. I’m now starting to realize that my goal should be organize, build habits, and eventually get off of the medication all together. 

It is a comfort knowing I could possibly get off them but always have them as a tool in my back pocket in case I start slip back into old habits!"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I haven’t been on medication since I was a child but I feel like it would be similar to drinking caffeine. If you haven’t had any in a couple weeks it makes you euphoric even just having a small amount but you quickly build a tolerance and then it has to be used strategically to have the most benefit.

Is it better to have 2 pills per day or 10 cups of coffee and a whole plethora of other stimulating behaviors to get by? I think the pills are a cleaner solution to the problem."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"This is so true and also depresses me sometimes. I have to do tolerance breaks and they are killer, but each time afterwards I am like ""yeah! Man it is so great I get to feel like this every day"" but I don't. I go back to leveling out and needing to depend on keeping myself motivated and driven.

Anyway, thank you for this post. It is so important to keep realistic expectations about ADHD and medication. Even 10 years in, its a good reminder."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I’ve been on vyvanse for almost 7 years now and OP is definitely right! At first I thought my meds were a cure to the problems but therapy makes SUCH a huge difference, and with the right tools and medication in place it really can change your life, just don’t go and expect it to happen from taking your medication alone! Good luck to anyone just starting meds, and if you don’t go to a therapist/ ADHD life coach (I actually use the life coach) already I would really really encourage it!"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Yessir...  once you level off you barely feel it.

You have to push yourself to get up and start your task and then you kinda ZONE OUT and next thing you know you're just doin it...

I thought my Addies would just save the day! That I'd be like ""WHOOOOO WEEEEE!"" AND JUMP UP  and START CLEANING...or do the laundry thats been piled up since 2020? YEAH NO.

I have SERIOUS ISSUES WITH MOTIVATION AND BEING ABLE TO STAY AWAKE. 
 I take Adderall and Provigil and I STILL fall asleep.
My meds make me AT LEAST 50% better, which is actually pretty good, so I'll take it."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,Yeah until your brain settles in you spend the first week or so getting high on a low dose of speed.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"THANK YOU!! These first day med posts are alarming. Like any med, you have to see how it is going to affect you over the long term."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Thank you! I agree too! All it does for me is take the edge off and make my symptoms manageable…the symptoms are still there and they still SUCK! But they are easier to manage. Non-ADHDers don’t feel the way we fell the first couple weeks, and when the meds stabilize we still don’t feel like they do. We are still at a disadvantage, but it’s easier to manage."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,Fixed me in 20 minutes.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Truth.

Stimulants definitely have helped me out since starting them a few years back.  Overall healthy living, definitely aids with everything.  Whether someone has ADHD, Depression, Anxiety, etc.

It's good to take breaks from any substance as well.  I call them ""wash out periods"", when I can afford to.  Then re-instate at a lower dosage, as it's more effective after taking a break.  Especially after daily use for a long time.

Personally I have to find my sweet spot.  Too high of a dose, and I just want to sleep.  Too little and it's a real challenge to focus on anything I really need to get done.  But, it's only an aid, within a multi-spoked approach to gain control over the symptoms.

I find it harder in the Winter to get going.  But, I can tell as soon as I've been slacking on exercise, and eating good meals throughout the day.  When I exercise daily, it's like being a totally different human being.  It does so much good for body/brain/mind.  If I slack off for a week, I become extremely depressed this time of year.

Finding a proper diet can be tricky as well, as everyone is different.  There is no one approach which will work for everyone.  So each individual needs to try different things out, and figure out what works for them.  Best to avoid things that will cause overall inflammation, as part of a nutritional plan.  Exercise in itself helps with inflammation as well."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,Thank you
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,I haven't found one yet that doesn't make me sleepy :'(
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"That is possibly the most patronizing and condescending thing I've seen on reddit today, and that says a lot.  As if all your suggestions after were some sort of revelation and no one did anything like that before medication. If you can't make simple nutritional meals (not even the proper word, it's nutritious) by time you can figure out how to get an account on reddit, you have more problems than ADHD.  Everything about your post is just so offensive."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,Very much agree. We still have adhd. But at least I can brush my teeth everyday now!
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"3-rd month on meds your words are true and insightfull , so thanks !"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Oh man the accuracy on this. 

I posted my feel good story 6-8 weeks after taking meds. The plateau was reached shortly after this. 

Environment and structure is completely and utterly essential to the effectiveness of the medication. 

I would also add,. Stay away from vices for a while to allow you to build these habits."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,Yea it helped alot at first now it just makes things manageable. Which is better than what it was before medications.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I still haven't gotten a medication that works because I'm terrified after not being able to sleep for months after I quit Adderall the first time. Though I am pretty sure my ADHD is triggered by some thyroid problems.

For my kiddo though, we've found keeping him on a low carb, high fiber diet makes a big difference, and if we can keep that under control, he also sleeps better, and if he sleeps better he handles everything better.

We really need to incorporate more activity."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,I took medication and it felt like nothing changed at all :/ these stories made my expectations too high; hopefully increasing the dosage and trying different types will result in more success
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,Yea medication makes me feel normal thank god  but I’ve definitely got habits/lifestyle things to kick now that I do feel normal
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Yes this 100% correct. I have been on adderall since I was 15 and I’m 38 now. Over the years as I got older and my brain chemistry changes, the way adderall worked in my system has resulted in massive increases in anxiety and other knock-on issues that effectively make continuing that treatment counterproductive and harmful. At a certain point I began abusing it (taking an extra dose at 5pm to be the Office Superman everyone once in a while), but I told myself that being on adderall is the only way for me to be productive and functional; I also denied that it was even possible to abuse it because it was doctor-prescribed. 
Yadda yadda yadda, I just got out of a week long stay in mental hospital after a nervous meltdown that wasn’t caused by Adderall necessarily but it certainly helped sustain it. I’m transitioning off adderall to straterra now. I hope it works. 

Another thing about adderall: it’s a controlled substance, which means you can’t setup multiple refills, nor can your doctor write you more than one prescription at a time. It’s always fun when you ask for a new scrip, get no answer from the doctor’s office, then have to call them and act like a crazy person to goose them into action only to find out that your doctor is on vacation and the back up prescriber has other patients in front of me. It’s not hard to act crazy because the withdrawal symptoms will MAKE you crazy. 

I don’t know how it works when you’re diagnosed for the first time these days, but when I was 15, there was no discussion about giving me coping skills to help me handle my symptoms on my own it was literally “take this pill and you’ll have no further problems.” 

So I think if you’re getting prescribed adderall, it should be for a relatively short period of time so you can get to a point where you can build coping skills, and then transition to a non-stimulant that doesn’t make ADHD diagnosed people jump through loads of bureaucracy to get ahold of. It becomes a trap that is very difficult to see and break out of. 

Good post OP."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I had to switch to Guanfecine because amphetamines are bad for me it turns out(long story) and it works great. Works in a strange way as there’s no high with it, just an ability to organize and think more clearly. It’s not as night and day as adderall but it works!"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I just started taking meds and on my first week mark as of today. I definitely was not expecting the “flip the switch” effect by day one. I actually thought i was reacting badly at first till i talked with my therapist and she reassured me that it’s just me getting used to taking stimulants after taking antidepressants for years.

Things that usually took me hours or days took me less than 30 minutes. The “some day tasks” i ended up finishing this week. I do daily hygiene habits without struggling now. And that’s not mentioning I was doubting about having adhd for a while till 2 medical professionals said I had it. 

The euphoria side effect explanation is definitely close to what i was feeling the past few days. I still take precaution about how i’m reacting to the meds even now. I got a lot to work to do now that i know i have adhd, and it’s gonna take more than these periods of euphoria to help me get back on track on my goals and future. Good post OP! Definitely needed to hear this after my first week."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Thanks for this and I am in total agreement.  I'm 43 and I started the guinea pig process for meds a couple months ago.

I've learned to take the meds if I know I have a big day ahead. If I have nothing to do, I won't take them as they make me feel crappy, tired, and decrease my lack of motivation, since I have no specific tasks that I need to complete. 

Works for me, others are different. I've lived this long without them, (terribly in some instances, including years of self medicating and addiction,) and I am now at a point where I understand the neurological reasons why I do the things I do. It makes it easier to incorporate diet and exercise plus meds, instead of totally being on them 100% of the time. I say this because I was originally one of the people who thought, ""if I just take a pill everyday, I'll be a brand new person."" I leaned quickly this is not the case.

The more you learn about the neurological reasons our brains are different, as well as understand the negative/traumatic experiences we can face just because we are wired differently, meds alone aren't going to be a magic pill."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Same thing for antidepressants, they really helped suppress some of the bad thoughts, and then I was able to start making progress to move forward. Medication, support systems, counselling, etc are assists to help you cope, but they won't work if you choose not to."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,Yeah I'm nearly through the honeymoon phase myself I think.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Agree totally. My change was more so in my mood and ability to not lose my temper as quick as I used to. I still get hyoerfocus and things such as rejection or perceived rejection still need a fuck ton of working on. Not a silver bullet as stated but yes, definitely a tool in the kit."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I have always heard meds don't solve everything. Sessions w/ therapist who specializes in add. Learning new ""tools""."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Thank you for this, it needed to be said, great advice"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"You shouldn't feel urge to do stuff after taking medication and I don't think it's healthy to pursue that feeling. after taking it daily for 8 months now I can't even tell if I've missed the dose or not but if I miss my dose I stumble around and forget things more, so then I know I didn't take my meds. I literally feel nothing after taking the meds. and that's how jt should be. and our current knowledge is that actual physical tolerance to"" that"" subtle anti ADHD effect is not likely. that's a good thing. but jf you follow the high, the speedy feeling, you are in for a big trouble. that's a bad idea. if you are unmotivated, you maybe have depression, anhedonia. maybe not. if you find tasks too daunting, break them down. take small baby steps. because that's low frustration tolerance I have OCD and ADHD both of which lower my frustration tolerance so it's really tough. But baby steps are better than nothing."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Yes make changes while you start it

I wouldve if i wasnt 11 at the time
Now here i am 15, i am a bit more productive but i mainly forget how it was in school
I started to not pay as much attention lately 
Also not to mention how many bad habbits i have now"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Thanks for the advise! I've already noticed differences in my body and behavior that will take some adjusting. I've never been one for structure or routine, but I feel like the medication can definitely start helping with that."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,I think it also might be the come up euphoria that you feel before body builds up some tolerance. It is definitely only a tool and I believe that no one feels that great all the time as the people starting stimulant medication for the first time.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"> a lot of it is also getting myself up to actually do the thing

Do you find meds help with that part at all?  Because honestly, that's one of my top 3 struggles.  Motivation to just start is so incredibly difficult.  There's always 'one more thing' and then next thing I know it's hours later....and I just give up.

My appointment is next week to talk about meds (looking at strattera or adderall)."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"My doctor said ""with medication, we're giving your engine enough of the correct fuel to function. You still need to use it to go somewhere, though"""
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,To be fair not being on medication makes everything a million times harder so you've been conditioned to not go do the things you need to do because it's been so hard your whole life
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Holy crap I felt this so hard. I ended up being a little too reliant on my meds and it meant when I didn't take them, I didn't even get out of bed. I let all of the techniques I spent years developing fall away and it was like I couldn't even fend for myself. It sounds so obvious to type it out, but I also just had this realization recently. You have to be ready to still fight your brain a little, even with meds. I thought I was so broken for so long, but no you really just have to have a dual approach and listen to your brain. It's like negotiating with a kidnapper honestly, my brain is holding dopamine hostage and I need it back with minimal casualties 🤣"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I really cannot reiterate how important this is. My first week, I felt like superman. And then some of the euphoria/honeymoon period went off and I became (almost) as bad as I was before. You have to realize that the pills are an opportunity to setup structures and habits which will support you long term. The pills help grease the wheels but you still need to work the machine. If you put yourself in a situation which doesn't set you up for success, it will still be quite hard. In many ways, the meds are magic, but in many ways they are not as well."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"First day I cried, it was a massive shift.   


Now a year on, eh... its stuff tough. less tough than before but tough. I do recall my Dr saying ""you give anyone stimulants they will do better"""
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"2 years later and things ain't perfect, but there has been a huuuuuge improvement. Fixed my chronic depression, I know I would not have been able to finish my masters without it, I'm at my healthiest weight since highschool. It's been amazing for me, it's not just the meds, but I would not be at the point I am without them"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I agree. First time I took adderall I’m like damn I feel normal and this is great! And then when I came down, I felt overwhelming anxiety because I realized truly how much ADHD affected me when I experienced a GLIMPSE of what I missed out on. Undiagnosed ADHD does years of trauma in my opinion. Knowing that yes, I’m diagnosed, but still feeling misunderstood and labeled as being lazy and slow for most of my life did damage to me that medication isn’t gonna fix, besides side effects it’s been giving me such as irritability and depression."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Maybe I'm an exception, but the med do still work wonders for me after 1,5 years on them..

I actually never had that feeling of euphoria on the meds. If I take too much, I just get brain fog, Raynaud's syndrome , and anxiety. 

I take 30mg ritalin per day, 5 days a week. On the off days I feel guilty about not cleaning or not working enough, but I just can't start the work. On the days I take my meds , I feel the same guilt, but can actually stand up and do the work. Which makes me happy. So yeah, very helpful."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,I’m happy when I see those posts. Life is too short not to enjoy it and get joy out of it
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,What? I see a lot of posts or comments of people saying that the first time barely lasts and that after that they will have to try a different dose or different medication
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,Consider it done! I'll write my 9 month review now!
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,">The posts themselves get a lot of karma, but what we really need is a six, twelve, and twenty four week follow up for those same people. I'd be willing to bet that the vast majority do not hold the same opinion by the end.

It's honestly one of those things that I think should be moderated a bit more closely. Seeing posts like this, and no follow-ups, can definitely lead people to the wrong conclusions. It builds up this idea that this is what your meds should be doing, and people who are just starting or seeking treatment might find themselves upping their dosage unnecessarily as they seek to have results that they erroneously believe are what they should be feeling. People new to medication should be allowed to celebrate the way they feel, but maybe we need automod to provide context about the first few days/weeks versus long-term expected effects of medication."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,Good points. I meet all the adhd criteria but Adderall ultimately has only left me psychologically addicted to stimulants rather than healing my ADHD.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"And here I am, over a decade out, and still feel like that.  Imagine that?  Sorry you haven't come up with a solution that works for you, I guess. My life was changed by medication. Everything else helped me cope until then, but the medicine was the last piece of the puzzle. And most everything about my life is wonderful now, except this pandemic. Don't think I can do much about that, on a grand scale."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"It's still a pretty great tool. But yeah, don't make any major life decisions in the first 90 days. Give yourself some time to adjust to the meds."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Just a tip from someone who's been there- remember to not try to change every single aspect of your life all at once. Don't set yourself up for failure! If you give yourself simple, specific goals that you can literally check off, it'll make the dopamine machine go brrrrrr and you'll be way more likely to keep going!! Like ""I want to do this one part of my ideal morning routine for at least 3 days this week"" and then raise it as you go. 

I still try to do everything all at once sometimes and keep having to remind myself of this, it's easier said than done. My therapist has to say it all the time, but I wish someone had told me this much earlier in my ADHD journey. Good luck and I hope the meds work for you!!!"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I love reading comments like these. I don’t need a wonder medication that changes who I am fundamentally— I need something that will allow me to actually *do* the things that I fantasize about doing. I want to be able to go to the gym regularly without knowing that I’m inevitably going to give up after a week because the motivation boost was just a temporary feeling, or to be able to take notes in class and actually remember what I learned, or to be able to start on homework *before* the last minute. It’s like sitting in your car, mapping out the destination you want to go to and how to get there, but you don’t have the keys to start the engine. I want those keys!!"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,This is how I feel too. I don’t feel “stuck” - you explained it perfectly.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"This is a complex subject. For me, I am addicted to having a measure of control over my ability to motivate myself to tackle difficult tasks. I use meds for that. Whenever I can, I try to take breaks from them/reduce my dose, so they can affect my psyche more when I take them for something serious. If a very difficult situation or set of tasks comes up, I take my full, daily prescribed dosage to compensate for my disability. So, I rely on my meds, like a crutch. Therefore, when I need a refill of my meds, and it is not forthcoming, I absolutely feel panicked and stressed. I used to think I was addicted to the meds themselves, and worried about it, but I realized I just don't like being without my reliable crutch for the difficult times. For context, been on them 4-5 years now, with a year or two completely off them in between. But I also didn't have a doc who told me not to take time off them. And I I've almost never taken a higher amount than my daily dose, and never has a doctor directed me to do so. I feel for your situation and sorry to hear you were pushed so hard into the meds. For me, I find the euphoric peak of my meds which is 2-3 hours after taking them (Vyvanse in my case) somewhat distracting. I find I am most productive just after that. Hence I sometimes reduce my dosage to avoid the sharp peaks.

In conclusion meds and our relationship with our reliance on them and the way they affect our psychology and physiology are very complex and difficult to navigate. I think OPs point about euphoria is accurate, however."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Just want to say. Try Dexedrine. I resented my meds for a long time, made me worn out, tired, on edge. BP always sitting in hypertensive range when its 110/65 without meds. Weeks in a row with a lot of work (that require more meds) ended up leaving me absolutely drained and desperate for a med break. Dexedrine is a completely different drug. BP is normal. Don't get tweaked. I can't believe adderall is even used, let alone as the first drug people try, dexedrine/vyvanse are so much nicer on the body (and mind)."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"i very much relate. All pills i've taken for depression and ADHD have given me unpleasant side effects. The immediate side effects are obviously the first day, but I'm talking long-term side effects. Strattera made me horrifically nauseous, vysanse made me tense up my body so much i could not have sex without a lot of pain, ritalin makes me clench my jaw so hard i have permanent intense face pain, zoloft gives me tremors, lexapro makes it very very hard to orgasm and all stimulants give me anxiety and raise my heartrate to concerning levels and make me crash horrifically in the evening when they wear off and I just lay in bed the final hours of the day until I can fall asleep. 

But I take them cause it's still much better than the alternative, and it helps me live somewhat of a functional life, get myself to answer my emails and pay my bills, do some exercise, make health appointments, and wash my dishes. 

Use the initial period to set out good structures, routines, habits, etc: make those appointments with health professionals you have put off, see an ADHD therapist specializing in managing your life more efficiently, fix your sleep rhythm, and set up an exercise regime.  

That euphoria is lovely but it goes away : you must not chase it because that will lead you down to dangerous roads.  What is left after a year are the side effects and a somewhat higher base level of functioning. Temper your expectations to reasonable levels."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,When I lock doors I make sure to pull it like twenty times. And then I drive down the street and convince myself it was a false memory/ or I actually forget it thirty seconds later and have to turn around lol
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Insulin, exercise and diet changes is a golden trio for diabetics?

Type 1 generally has a genetic component and they rely on insulin but exercise and diet changes aren't that necessary, Type 2 is usually due to being overweight or hormonal issues and while their body still produces insulin (generally) it's not enough so they regulate through pills and diet.

So maybe the first two for type 1, but type 2 I'd say the last two are needed but you have to be careful especially injecting a type two with insulin, since they still produce some insulin you're more likely to put them into insulin shock over helping them more than anything. 🤣

Sorry, just felt the need to clarify the differences between type 1 and 2 as people generally can't tell the difference."

What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"What food is best for ADHD med use and also helping ADHD?

Like breakfast, lunch, dinner?"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,I'm on 40 mg Adderall XR but the generic version. I've only had one day out of 30 where I felt razer sharp focused. The biggest factor of that day was a manic episode and I don't know if a manic episode is viewed as euphoria?
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,Oh jeez I'm so afraid of this happening
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I 1000% agree with this. I hate how popular posts like that are in this sub and I agree that they are really dangerous. The reason ADHD meds are controlled so tightly is the potential for abuse, and posts like that make medication sound EXTREMELY appealing to someone who might not even have ADHD. Almost everyone has trouble with chores, ADHD people might struggle more but it’s not like people without it just get their rocks off folding laundry. Posts like that along with so much misinformation on other forums I have a feeling are leading to a lot of over diagnosis..

This sub is very pro-med, which is great because there’s a lot of stigma, but 8 posts a day of someone saying they just burst into tears because their first dose of medication makes them feel so calm and they were able to do EVERYTHING they wanted to do that day with a million awards attached is extremely misleading. There are automatic disclaimers posted when people try to talk about RSD, something many of us relate with, but praising medication almost as a super drug is ok lol. 

I know it’s unrealistic but I also wish they would censor these posts because it’s also just disconcerting to see as someone who has been on meds a while. I’m happy for them, but it just makes me roll my eyes a bit."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"A lot of us who say that, are still saying it years later. Over a decade for me. It is part of my treatment and my life is pretty awesome, and the medication was the last piece of the puzzle.  

And those meds helped me get through my nursing studies so don't even try the tale that I don't know what I am talking about.  Pharmacology was easier to study when medicated!"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,Could you give me a link to those sources? I am always leaving comments pointing out that the initial euphoria isn’t indicative to what it’s like and would love some hard evidence to share.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,[deleted]
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,It depends a lot on the medication.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Well the boost is basically what your brain would produce if you didn’t have ADHD. (Unless your medication is not at the right dose) 
So sure people can get a kick out of having what people without our disorder get naturally"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I know a lot of non-ADHD people who struggle with procrastination, forgetfulness, disorganization, and lack of motivation. I also know people who really are by nature just able to fold their laundry, keep things clean, etc. So I imagine it depends on the person. It just worries me to send the message “normal people are able to easily do everything on their to do list” because that implies if you don’t feel that way you have ADHD, which seems like oversimplifying."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"It's also easy to forget that people start taking meds at different points in their lives, which can greatly affect how they view taking them.

I got diagnosed late (34) and although I didn't know I was dealing with ADHD, I had been dealing with the symptoms my whole life and had already read so much on planning and productivity and tried so so so many 'systems'. 

With meds I could suddenly do all those things *consistently*, which was key to them actually working. 

So even though I know I'm doing so much more than just taking meds, meds will always feel like 'the final piece of the puzzle' /the actual solution.

I can imagine someone who starts taking meds before they learn about planning will feel like it's the opposite. Like taking meds is the first step, but learning to plan etc is the key to actually enjoying life more."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Yes but very, very few people take meds for the first time and experience a joyous sense of clarity and clear headedness THAT DOESN'T DIMINISH as they continue to take them.

I think the post is about that, the hundreds and hundreds of posts saying 'this is my first day on meds and I'm so happy and excited I'm crying with joy. This is how neurotypicals feel all the time, and what ADHD treatment is supposed to do'.

Those posts are at best, woefully misguided and at worst, actively spreading and promoting the message that meds = euphoria and a lifelong ability to do everything easily."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I took a cheek swap gene test and my doctor found out my body was completely throwing out most of the dose of my meds, which made sense as to why I constantly felt the need to double the 27mg COncerta she gave me to 54. Now my doctor thinks my 54mg dose is not high after understanding how my body interacts with the drugs.

On the opposite, we discovered that my body slowly overtime takes in most of the SSRIs, so overtime, I felt a need to take less, as my dose I was taking seemed to have stronger effects for no reason all of a sudden. And I'd end up quitting the medications. Turns out its also why I dont build tolerances to addictive things, my body has a tendancy to throw out most doses of these things and one day my body may throw out more than another. Fascinating stuff.

My doctor asked if I wanted to switch to Focalin after that but we decided to just stay on my 54mg concerta and to revisit Focalin if it starts to feel too mellow, then if Focalin has the same affects as adderall (I had anxiety and bad dry mouth) we could always up the dose to 72mg concerta since I am genetically going to take that dose the same way someone else may take a 36mg dose. Very strange"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Lol I feel the same way. They are so obviously written by someone who is experiencing euphoria. And that’s great for them, but those posts are like the front page of the sub every other day with a million rewards. It sends a weird message."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,[removed]
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"You won't get ""energized and focused"" back. Maybe 10%. _however_ you should still be able to get more done and be more in control. The feeling will be gone but at the end of the day you'll notice that you were more in control than without.

If you have signs of depression, narcolepsy etc you need to treat them separately. The added energy will mostly go away."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"If you want to find out why you are taking them, take a few days completely off them before resuming them again. You'll see what they are doing. You can take breaks, which might help you  remember how helpful they can be. I take breaks whenever I can for this exact reason.

I'll also say Adderall never lasted for me. Spikes and drops of effectiveness. I take Vyvanse, but it's expensive, even with insurance. Lasts all day for me, however, which I find useful when I need it."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Great comment. My experience echoes these points closely, thank you.

Edit-- also, your username is the three syllable summary of my adult life"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,I'm sorry this is happening to you. I'm in a similar place. I've found the only thing that helps sometimes is taking a medication break. Which can be impossible when life is overwhelming and meds are the only thing that help you function
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,In what way??
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I have not straightened out, that's why I made this post. Medication made my life more manageable for a while: I got back in school, moved out, and got an internship. But now I'm really struggling. I can't keep up like neurotypicals and it's hard to accept that medication can't completely fix that"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I had that on Ritalin - absolutely no effect unless I took 20mg or more. As I'm a pretty small person, and generally a lightweight, the doc didn't think starting me on such an absurdly huge dose would be a great idea.
Switched to dex / lisdexamphetamibe (Vyvanse) and had a much more normal reaction."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Links to and mentions of ADDitude are not allowed on /r/adhd because we feel they have demonstrated themselves to be untrustworthy and that they, despite soliciting donations from people with ADHD to fund their operation, prioritize profit and advertising dollars over our best interests. Their website is full of articles promoting the use of homeopathy, reiki, and other unscientific quack practices. They also have had articles for Vayarin (a medical food that is now no longer sold in the US because its research was bunk) that suspiciously looked like stealth advertisements (which is highly unethical and illegal in the US).

We also find it problematic that their medical review panel includes not only legitimate doctors and psychologists, but also (at the time of writing) one practitioner of integrative medicine, which combines legit medical practice with pseudoscience and alternative medicine. They have previously had other quacks on the panel as well.

What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"By simple nutritional meals I don't mean that making nutritional meals is a simple thing, quite the oppposite. I mean it's important to figure out essentially how to ADHD-hack mealtimes. This could mean precutting vegetables so when you're ready you can put them in a salad, or even buying premade meals that have good nutritional content. The things I listed are really hard for someone with ADHD, which is why medication is often needed to establish good habits. Nutrition is vital for ADHD brains, and just like medication, it won't fix everything--but it's a piece of the pie."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"This post wasn't an anti-stimulant rant about how ADHD people need to just get it together without medication, because we all know how impossible that is sometimes. You may want to assess why it upset you so much. Believing that medication is a cure all was really harmful for me and I'm sure it is for other people on this sub"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Not the original commenter, but hell yes for me! I used to procrastinate for half a day-whole day, wake up at 9am and start working around midnight etc. After taking concerta I just get up and do things without thinking and being stuck in my head, it's unreal! Esp. exercise; I used to skip so many times and now I just get out and get dressed while \*wanting\* to procrastinate, while heading to the gym."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I'm on vyvanse. So it's really on having effect when I've taken it. So it takes a bit of motivation to get up in the morning still, but I think knowing that with the meds/therapy and other methods of managing my ADHD I find it easier to get up as the rest of the day isn't as daunting anymore.

OP is right, meds are only half the battle. But I'm 4 months in with meds now and Ive had days were I haven't taken them, after nightshifts mostly which I know I'll be tired from anyway but things are hugely harder without the meds. Being tired will also exacerbate things but when I have a day without them I definitely notice my mood swings, frustration and executive dysfunction return quite a lot. 

Some of the best support I've had is on this subreddit. You guys are awesome."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I got a few tips! 

-Don’t actually DO the thing. Just get ready to do it. For example, if you have to write a report just open all the relevant tabs you need and format the paper. The key is to either lower the barrier of entry so you DO actually do it, or just to get everything ready for when you decide to start so there are no distractions.

-Don’t focus on EVERYTHING. I like to narrow it down to two tasks i need to do that day. Then I get to choose which one! Idk why this works, but it does. After each thing, if you’re having trouble switching give yourself a 30-minute break. 

-Top tier tip: if you need to get up and Simply Cannot, say OUT LOUD “I’m getting up at the count of 5” and then count down out loud. There is some neuroscience reason this works, but I cannot remember it. 

-Finally, and I’m sorry for this one, but get a planner. Neurotypicals have gentrified the bullet journal, but I’d HIGHLY recommend doing the original version. Basically, blank pages and you just create a schedule for however long you want based on what makes sense in your brain. I personally do like to decorate it so it’s like…fun. But you don’t have to. The idea isn’t to use it as a memory aide, but so you’re not so overwhelmed with 200000 tasks. My rule is I can’t have two busy days back-to-back (if possible). Try to schedule it so you have a recovery day between task-saturated days. 


I think that’s it? I’ll add more if I think of them!"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I try to be busy while the meds kick in. If I’m doom scrolling as the meds start working, I may get trapped doomscrolling all day."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"yes! but, i think another thing that helps me to get motivated it to have a goal, nothing huge or crazy but something i want to accomplish. it can be something as simple as ""i want to fold my laundry and put it away today"" or ""i want to complete some homework assignments"". 

i take 10mg adderall ir and it definitely gives me a boost of motivation but one thing i don't do is take it and just stand around and wait for it to make me want to do something, ya know? 

sorry if this was explained poorly"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,I take my meds in bed with water when I wake up and they help a ton  if they're needed. Basically if it gets to the point where I can feel the meds kicking in I get out of bed because I need to eat something.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"It's the getting there that's toughest for me.  Meds have been huge for me. But - I generally have to force myself to get going. Once I'm doing it,  I'm ALL in. It's the getting there,  though. That's the toughest. If only there was a pill for that."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"no

lol

which is inconvenient"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,Absofuckinglutely.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"For me its the get up and do something that gets fixed. Normaly i would skip stuff because i would be tired or i would feel the amount of energy it would cost is more then i had left. 

Now on meds i think, hmm why not do x its not a big deal.

So for me it makes the ""starting to do something"" more natural."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Ah sounds executive function disorder. It's when we have multiple things to do but that given all the options we have a hard time choosing what to start with then end up doing nothing. Also, Adderall and Straterra are way different kinds of medications. I take Straterra."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Don’t write methylphenidate off without trying it, it has the same therapeutic efficiency as Adderall but less cardiovascular side effects with long term use and doesn’t build tolerance as fast as Adderall, presumably because it’s a sigma 1 receptor agonist that enhances NMDA-receptor response. Strattera is something for when Ritalin or Adderall don’t work for you and has the most side effects that make people stop using it."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,thats exactly what i think too! adderall is the fuel and you are the driver of your car. the fuel will only help you reach the destination but the most important thing is you gotta drive to get there and the fuel can't do that for you lol
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"> I do recall my Dr saying ""you give anyone stimulants they will do better""

Are you me? I had the first doctor I saw in my new city say the same thing to me. It was really jarring to hear after coming from a more conservative state where my PCP was completely fine prescribing Adderall to me.

Thankfully I have since found a wonderful psychiatrist (though he's private, no insurance for visits). To anyone reading this, please don't continue to give your business to people that say things like this. It's a tell-tale sign that they don't really know what ADHD is like.

Sorry to hijack your comment, but this really resonated with me after having heard the exact same line before..."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,1 year in and anxiety gone. Worth it

What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,Same. The meds did not magically fix all of my issues. But they helped wear some of the burden and thus allowed me to actually be able to work on mylproblems.

Also, talk to your doctor about other options. Vyvanse is designed to be safer and less habit forming."

What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,Thank you! I will keep this in mind! My morning routine needs work so this is perfect.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"That explanation about the car has been the description of my entire life. I actually realized I had adhd fairly recently and when I started thinking I had it and brought it up, everyone I knew was like ""wait, you're not medicated for adhd....?"" I went to my psych and he immediately started me on meds. But the clicking moment for me was online schooling. All of my friends hated going to school online. They couldn't focus. Couldn't take notes. Couldn't remember anything from classes. But, that's what I felt like with regular schooling? The only difference with online is, now it was recorded, so anytime I got that focus fixation I was able to go back and watch the lectures at my own speed and takes notes, as many times as I wanted. My GPA went up 1.25 points over the Covid year haha.

I actually have no idea what all this had to do with what you said other than your analogy has really explained my entire like up to 23 years old."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I've just started on meds amd started on dexamphetamine - not the slow release but the normal release 5mg a day twice a day - was on for a couple of weeks then this week went up to 10mg twice a day as it felt the 5mg wasn't working well after the initial 'omg i can do everything easily' in the first week.

Is that dexedrine? Or is dexedrine the slow release?

I feel this med also makes my heart feel heavy/chest a bit tight a couple of hours into my second dose and have palpiations later. Does that level out after a bit? 10mg seems to help me focus a bit better (though still not as much as i'd like it to and still hard to focus when i have multiple things i need to do in a work day) but yeah."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Adderall and Dexedrine are mostly the same. Adderall is 3 parts d-amphetamine 1 part l-amphetamime and Dexedrine is just pure d-amphetamine. Whether or not it is better is dependent on the individual, but if anything Dexedrine is the more intense stimulant"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I've no clue why they put people on amphetamines first. I've seen several people denounce it as a practice - why not start off with good old methylphenidate, for example, and leave amphetamines for the more resistant cases?"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants, What dose of Dexedrine are you on? Sorry for being nosy. I'm wanting to explore switching from Adderall IR to something else that hopefully won't cause the chronic insomnia issues. Does your insurance cover the cost?

What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,I've started writing things like this down to talk to my therapist and just wrote the exact same thing before reading your comment. I've always just learned to deal with these things as a bunch of little inconveniences
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I hate it! I do this too and no matter how many times I trust my memory I immediately dismiss it and remind myself that if I go back and check again, **That** will prove to myself that it is indeed shut/locked and until I actually do that I'm going to needlessly worry so why fight myself? Then I remind myself that I am a really good sparring partner.

Edit I mean I hate how I can't trust myself when it comes to locking a door because earlier this month we had a cat get out and it's like the worst thing that happened because it was in the middle of a snowstorm and he was a kitten it wasn't even a year old and it came from shutting the door and not locking it and half hour later the cats gone. It consumes me and it's been a month now and I haven't gotten him back"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,That's definitely OCD behavior.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Thank you for this! Way too many people are only familiar with type 2 diabetes.

As a T1D (LADA technically) the lack of understanding of how ""diabetes"" is a insanely overbroad term."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Type 2 DM is actually significantly more genetic than type 1! Also most folks with type 2 diabetes will eventually require insulin as their pancreatic beta cells burn out from attempting to make so much insulin that the cells are resistant to. (source = med student @ ucla, could find google scholar sources if you'd like)"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I edited to specify Type 2 as well as my phrasing, as a couple things occurred to me.
1. I assumed folks would get that I meant Type 2, but that’s my bad for sure! 
2. The “most type 2 diabetics don’t use insulin” surprises me- but I was also basing my idea of “the golden trio” on when I was working at a hospital. But a hospital is typically going to include more patients with uncontrolled/less-controlled type 2 diabetes, especially in the floors I frequented, plus I administered insulin injections but didn’t do med pass, so that’s unintentional bias on my part for sure!"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I depend *a lot* on alarms, notifications, reminders, lists, calendars, and now my pocket planner. If you have someone you’re close to, asking them to “check on” your habit development can sometimes help, or asking them to join you in that habit. I also find it easiest to do things every day or on the same days- routine makes it easier for me to remember my habits."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Oh I moreso meant “consistent eating habits” to be literal- before meds I easily forgot to eat for a whole day or I would nonstop snack all day, no middle ground. But I’ve seen people mention protein-dense diets on this sub!"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Censor the truth? Why?

Not everyone failed on medication. Some of us have continued success over the years, maybe because we put the work in. Don't hate those of us who are thriving, excelling, and exceeding expectations. My life changed for the better, and I am far beyond what I ever expected years ago. I started medication in 2009. And now you are telling me I need to shut up because something WORKED, when there was such a stigma and I suffered into my 30s.  No. I won't shut up. I won't stop telling the truth. Ever. It's not my fault some people do not have stellar results.  And it certainly isn't the fault of the medication that some of you are failures."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"That's genuinely great for you. A lot of people who buy scratchcards even though they're really hard up have in fact got rich, and a lot of people who married after dating for two rollercoaster months will always say how it was the best decision they ever made. If they have any knowledge of statistics though, they would be stupid or negligent to pretend that their experiences are the norm, or to advise everyone to do the same.

Sure, we all MIGHT be one of the few whose adhd is pretty much cured by medication, but if everyone assumes that then most people will be bitterly disappointed, and / or addicted. If everyone assumes that they are going to react normally to adhd meds (euphoria at the beginning, wearing down to a subtle effect - or no positive effect  on this particular type) then everyone is realistically prepared for the most probable outcome, and if it works better than expected, that's a pleasant surprise."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Therapy is pretty key. The good news with COVID is that maybe you can find virtual group classes further away from you to join. I did some individual therapy then group therapy and found group therapy to be awesome. They arm you with strategies to manage specific problems for you. They're not all going to work for you, so you have to also have to figure out what will. Though I did notice that the main practice my therapist taught was of mindful meditation. He said it was to teach our overactive brains how to be bored. Makes sense. It's also hella hard but I think that's the point. Whenever your ADHD kicks in hella hard, you can train your brain to slow down and think.

Tons of great books out there. I have trouble getting through a book that doesn't grab my attention, personally, but some recognize that and try and make it 'readable' for people with ADHD. 

There's also an ADHD podcast I've listened to.

One thing I still suck at is sleep. Still trying to develop nightly habits to get me into bed before midnight...

And exercise. Release dopamine, which our brains lack so we feel satisfied. For me... I'm always jumping from thing to thing without feeling good about any of it. I'm searching for that dopamine-fueled feeling of pleasure. Even though Its hard to find the motivation to exercise (classes or set times help), I recognize that I feel great after I do.

So... It's a lot of hard work. Difficult tasks. New habits. But ADHD is hard. It's difficult. And doesn't make me feel good about myself. So I'm working at it.

Ps. I'm on Vyvanse and I did not have the same feeling of clarity many feel on meds. It's more subtle. It's more like... I can tell when I'm NOT on it. Or rather... My partner can tell... I'm more chaotic and all over the place when I talk to her. It gives me a bit more calm but I've never ever felt ""omg it's like I'm wearing glasses for the first time and I can see everythingggggg""."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Yes “normal” brains can be forgetful at times, disorganized, and so on. HOWEVER, I’m also not entirely convinced that every “normal” brain forgetful or disorganized person you described don’t have ADHD either. A doctor can tell you you don’t have ADHD, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you don’t have it.

There are lots of reasons why a Doctor will deny you a accurate diagnosis: they choose not to believe the countless studies, they don’t think it exists, they think the patient is claiming ADHD so they can get stimulants for their addiction (despite there being absolutely no history of it), the patient is female and there for cannot have ADHD (no really, doctors pull that shit), the doctor does not see patient behaving in a stereotypically ADHD way or patient can’t focus on work but can focus on video games and therefore patient must not have ADHD (even though countless studies show that you can have ADHD without being stereotypically ADHD and still being able to focus on video games, the one of few things that is scientifically designed to be mentally stimulating in the first place). Doctors do and often misdiagnose people with ADHD as having depression, having anxiety, or choose to not diagnose them at all, invalidate their experiences, and insult their character in one foul swoop.

“Normal” people can skip out on their to-do list and pick it up tomorrow. People with ADHD acknowledge the to-do list, know the to-do list needs to be done, know there are consequences if they don’t do it but physically cannot bring themselves to do it that day, the next, or the day after that.

It may not always be easy for a “normal” person to finish their to-do list but their obstacles still are no where close to what ADHD people have to go through. 

Everyone has their baggage and difficulty. But don’t get it twisted. Being occasionally forgetful, or being disorganized because work got hectic is NOT the same as having a disability that literally makes organizing your desk on a slow day like climbing Mount Everest."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,This is a really good point.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,I sleep during the day and wake up at night usually. No narcolepsy. With first adderall I instantly switched to awake during the day and asleep at night. But now since I got really sad and scared I’d never feel better again my doc thinks I’m having a bad rebound and wants me to stop taking it all weekend. Then come up with a different plan on Monday. I was misdiagnosed with bipolar so that why he started me in such a low dose. He was afraid I’d go manic. But I didn’t. So yay no bipolar at least.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,Why not?  Isn’t that what the meds are for?
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I took almost the entire month of December off (winter break) in hopes that would fix it but it didn’t. I was so disappointed and I don’t even know how to explain it to my doctor, especially since he did agree with me to try switching to Adderal XR a few months ago and then switching back to Vyvanse. I’m worried bringing it up again will not look as great given the stigma for stimulants. It just sucks."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Your heart and stuff, look it up"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Oh thank you for the information!
I was mainly wandering on the life management ideas side of the website, since I usually look for different ways to stay on track of things, for that I found it fairly helpful . But of course any medical stuff should be handled with an actual real life doctor (and no one who does not have a vitamin/mineral deficiency needs to take supplements), thank you for pointing that out."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Yeah I've tried splitting them up. My doctor was giving me 120 x 10mg in a prescription so that I could take 3 day.. something like that. My brain can't math today. And I've tried the extended release ones. The anger is just too much. I think I need something entirely different, but doctor's don't really try to help you get there. They just get you on whatever they can. I tried taking it with Wellbutrin too, to stabilize my mood."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Hahahahahaha

hahahahahaha

ADHD doesn't make you stupid. You are treating people with ADHD like stupid, idiotic, incompetent children.

Now maybe YOU were, but I assure you, not all of us are so incompetent at life that we needed a post like this acting as if everyone with ADHD is a failure at life."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Thank you - that's helpful!  I keep waffling about if I want to even start anything and if it's worth the potential side effects, but man, I need serious help in that regard before I end up on an episode of hoarders LOL."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,Can I ask how much you're taking? I think I need to ask to be increased. But I'm also afraid of being judged. I'm on 27 right now
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,How long have you been on?
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Fuck man, i envy you so much :((("
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Luckily getting up in the morning isn't too much of an issue - bottom tier of Maslow's heirarchy I need a job to keep covered lol so all good there, but things like daily household chores beyond absolute bare min (i.e. do you have clean underwear to put on?) are such a struggle.  Like if I needed to call maintenance to come in here tomorrow to fix something, I'd be mortified at the state of things.  And when I was in college, getting homework done was TORTURE."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Hey vyvanse pro tip! I’ve been taking it for about 7 years now. It takes about 1-2 hours or so to kick in.  I like to set an alarm for an hour or so before I actually need to wake up, take my meds, then go back to sleep. It’s so much easier to get out of bed when they’re fully kicked in! You basically have an hour of sorta-focus to wake up and get going before full focus hits.

Also, put your meds on top of your phone. I’ve never missed a dose doing that."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"the first tip is interesting, because i feel like it works the opposite for me! if i know that as soon as i open my computer, i'm going to have to dive into proper work then i'll put off opening my computer for ages / go on to other stuff. whereas if i can tell myself 'don't worry, we're not gonna jump straight into the sprint, we're gonna do a little warmup first of opening tabs etc.' then i can ease myself into work better. at least for my unmedicated mind"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"If you only knew how many partially used planners and journals I've accumulated over the years. :/  Maybe after I start meds, I can keep it up."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"heyheyheyhey, maybe make this into a separate post for visibility? the first point - about preparation - makes so much difference for me.

oh, and thanks for the countdown tip. i used to do that, but... you guessed it - forgot."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,These are so good! I arrived at some of them just from trial and (lots of) error over the years. Did you have any other tips?
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I have my pills next to my bed. I usually wake up about an hour before I really need to so I take them the minute I wake up. I'll usually go back to sleep or I'll lay there and do some reading. 

My tip is the minute I take my pills I turn the bottle upside down. I never have to guess if I've taken my pills. It's pretty easy f1or me to tell,  mentally, if I've taken them. Usually. But still, I think turn them back over when I go to bed at night."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"No no, I get it.  Trust me, I have many things I want to accomplish, specific things that I make mental lists for and just can't seem to get started on.  Lived 40+ years just thinking I was exceptionally lazy."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,That's my goal!  I really hope something helps me with that.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Yeah, my doctor already gave me the basic rundown of both options but since my BP already runs borderline high, strattera is in the running."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,Oh we're not writing anything off - next week's appt is just the first try of meds so we're just starting this process (me and my doctor).
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Wait, it is true that it will at least temporarily increase most peoples function. I'm a licensed clinical addictions specialist, licensed clinical mental health counselor, take Adderall for adhd myself and don't see the problem with the statement? Adderall often can and does give euphoria to people with ADHD too. It's a myth that it has completely opposite effects on the 2 groups."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,Even Dr Barkley said this. The difference between ADHD people and everyone else is mainly that ADHD folks get more benefits from stimulants. But everyone gets some benefits. Usually neurotypicals don't benefit enough to justify the side effects.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"My Dr. is amazing, been dealing with mental health folks for 8 years now and he is the first one who who can prescribe who really listened and has helped. Surprising as he is through the VA, but he came there after like 20 years of private practice because he wanted to help Vets. He does not know everything and he knows it, and we have really good discussions about what is going on and ways to work through things. He has Undiagnosed probably more than he has diagnosed things that previous Dr's handed me a work sheet and sent me out the door with buckets of Bipolar meds.   


He was getting at, was for me to pay attention (haha) to what changes I saw and if it was ADHD symptom relief or just tweeking. Out of context with out tone I can see where that may seem problematic.   


That same discussion he was asking me questions about if I had ever done stimulants recreationally,,, I paused because I was trying to remember and he said "" Listen Wispeedcore2, I'm not a cop.... I am just trying to find out if you had used them before and if they were helpful"""
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,It’s all about which Dr gets compensation for prescribing. Some will stay far away from it while some will write scripts like tickets
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"5 months in, anxiety is still here but it's only here when it should be and not just from overthinking myself into oblivion over small stuff"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"If it helps, I used to struggle to put on weight before my meds, and now a couple years into them I've finally started putting on a great amount of weight with protein smoothies."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"If you don't mind me asking, what medicine did they put you on? I was put on Vyvanse when I was younger and struggled to eat for awhile and ended up switching to Concerta and it made a world of change! Although now that I am in my 20's I really wish I could've learned task based ADHD training instead of just getting thrown on medication"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Not the person you responded to, but I now have more energy, I don't have as much of a barrier to do things as I used to, I find things just more deeply rewarding (have more fun as well as feel a greater sense of accomplishment when doing things). The biggest thing is that I don't let myself fall so far behind with work and responsibilities, now I dont always have this cloud hanging over me just sapping my energy and keeping me constantly stressed and overwhelmed"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"What solidified the medication’s effectiveness for me is that my partner started thanking me for helping out around the house more. I wasn’t even trying to help out more - I was more focused on a new job and trying to keep a bunch of personal stuff together, but she said I had definitely started doing more - putting the leftovers away, doing the dishes, picking up clutter… And this was months after I’d started taking it. I had a semi-euphoric first couple days, but after a few weeks, that’s not what was driving me."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,I’m only a few weeks into adderall but I can say the difference has been night and day. I feel like I’m compelled to get shit done now whereas before the only thing I was compelled to do was sit on the couch.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"This is my experience too. I can't tell if it's working because some days I get hyperfocused on the wrong thing or if I was productive how do I know that's the medicine? 

I watched that Netflix scare flick about kids hooked on ADHD meds and instead of scaring me it made me realize many people are taking easily three or four times my dosage.

Despite this, it's only supposed to last four hours but I swear the days I take it I stay up much later so I think it takes me longer to metabolize."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"The changes were obvious when I first took it but that’s because I had a goal in my mind upon taking it. I take it so I can be able to study and do homework and I have to have the goal set in my mind to do that when I’m taking it. If I just take the medicine with no goal that I need to focus on, it’s not as noticeable. Medicine can give you the power to focus but it’s up to you where you wanna put that energy. There’s day where I plan on being productive, take the medicine, and then end up spending hours on social media. It’s hard to navigate. If you still have issues, you may need to increase the dose you’re taking. And in the case you’re taking other medications like antidepressants, these can reduce the effectiveness. If I take adderall with lexapro, I feel it cancels out imo. It could be that something else is reducing the effectiveness. Also, diet can play a role. It might be worth telling your symptoms to your doctor and getting a blood test (most covered by insurance!) I’m waiting to find out if I’m B12 deficient currently, which can play a role in attention. I’ve also noticed that my ADHD meds are more effective when I eat a good meal, esp meals with protein. Protein shakes with your meds might help. It’s hard to eat with meds of course so try to eat a good meal before! I hope you find something that works for you."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,Story of my life lol
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Oh I relate to this 1000% I didn't really notice a difference between in-person classes and zoom classes, other than the fact that I felt less anxious being able to keep my camera off, and like you said, I was really able to benefit from recordings. I'm not diagnosed or anything (still waiting to meet with a psych), but I'm hoping to get some answers and make a change soon!"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Instant release dexamphetamine is dexedrine. Extended release is vyvanse. I'm not sure, I've never had palpitations from dexedrine. You should speak to your doctor. 10mg IR is a pretty hefty dose, it may go away with time I don't know, but if it's not helping focus as much as you'd like it may be worth trying something else."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Yep, dexedrine is mg for mg more potent. Meaning less can be used. Levoamphetamine is significantly more peripheral in action, and also has a longer half life, meaning that it can build up more and has greater effect on the cardiovascular system. Some people do find adderall to be better for them, they like the physical boost that it provides (in the form of increased hr and vasoconstriction)."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I take anywhere from 5-15mg depending on my needs. Usually 10mg. Used to take 12.5-20mg of Adderall. Adderall is both dexamphetamine and levoamphetamine, and levoamphetamine does have a longer half life, and can contribute more so to insomnia issues, in my opinion. But, like the other person responding, that obviously can vary wildly from person to person. 

My insurance does cover it. I think it's definitely worth a shot if yours does as well. I take my last dose no later than 4:30 and don't ever have trouble falling asleep around 12. If I took 15mg or more of adderall at 4pm I would likely have problems that night."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,I find dexamphatamine so far (see my other post just above) does make it hard for me to get to sleep if i take the second dose \~1-2pm and go to bed at 11-12pm. Last night I also couldn't sleep because i was having palpitations and had to sit up in bed for a bit before they subsided around 12:30-1pm.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Took ritalin when I was kid. Didn't work well enough. My description above is for adderall. Maybe dexedrine doesn't wake me up quite as much? But that's fine for me. I am way less on edge, more confident and social. It really is not a massive difference in how it works in relation to adhd.. if you take adderall you already take dexedrine, you just also take levoamphetamine."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,Right? So many things I’ve struggled with I had no idea that it related to ADHD
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Same, I even bought a notebook and kept it regular for a few weeks, some doctors liked it, others didn't acknowledge it. May I add using a note app on your phone or computer where you see it the most?

It can nudge you into using it more and writing more down. It's also a great way to vent about life on our journey to better understand ourselves and to heal. I had always wanted to start doing this after I saw many people suggesting it but I would forget until I saw it again and so on. I put a widget on my phone home screen and my tablet so it's right in my face."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,You are somewhat obsessive compulsive then.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,I think I have OCD tendencies and similarities but that’s common of people with ADHD. I don’t think I actually have OCD though.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"People can have both and others, I've got more than just those two lol"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"My favourite stereotype for diabetics is the whole ""all fat people must be diabetic!"" Urm well I've been diabetic for about 15 years now and I've never gone over 11.3 stone (I kept checking lol) so people automatically think I'm not diabetic because I'm skinny 🤦‍♂️

The main reason I love to educate people is due to the fact about 90% of people I know would happily give me insulin if I passed out from low blood sugar, and thanks to Hollywood people thinks that would help instead of, you know, killing me lol."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Didn't know that about type 2! I'll definitely do some research into that, fair point on the eventual part I was just generally speaking as I've known a few idiot type 2s get taken to hospital because they thought they could take the same amount of insulin as a type 1 smh.

I knew type 2 had a genetic component but didn't realise it was that prevalent...

Have they sort out the classification for Alzheimer's yet? I heard a while back some researchers were linking insulin dyssregulation to it and were trying to get the ball rolling on re classifying some Alzheimer's patients as type 3 diabetics 🤔"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I don't think the point of my post was communicated well to you. My apologies, Im an engineer, not a writer and I struggle to get my point across sometimes. I'm not saying that medication doesn't work. I'm saying that I wish I had established healthier structures and habits when I first started medication. After years of being on it, it certainly still works, perhaps less so lately. But there's nothing like that first eye-opening month. I'm glad you feel that you are excelling, but some of us still struggle on medication. And it can be really discouraging when those around us think we should be better just because we are on meds"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Medication works for me too…. I’m not saying people shouldn’t talk about it or de-stigmatize it. I’m saying most people experience an initial period of euphoria where it’s easy to do everything they want to do every day and they feel mildly superhuman. That’s just a fact. And a lot of the people who make a post during their first day, or first week, are experiencing that. I experienced that period as well, and when I settled into a routine, it was confusing when I noticed I wasn’t experiencing the same degree of intense motivation and drive as before. I first upped my dose, then felt like I needed to take more any time I didn’t notice that “rush.” I ended up quitting medication because I felt like I was getting addicted but I couldn’t even tell what the effects were supposed to be. After quitting my symptoms obviously reappeared and I realized how bad it was before, so I started again and realized I had a) just been on the wrong formulation and b) had been mistaking the initial euphoria for the intended effects.

Medication helps me a lot. And for the record, insinuating that this is me “hating on people who put the work in” is kind of dismissive and rude. All I’m saying is that posts making it seem like medication is supposed to make you feel like you can do 18 tasks a day and never feel anxiety are dangerous because for 90% of people that’s not true, and can lead to people who don’t have ADHD seeking stimulants because everyone wants to be able to be more productive and feel good, and can lead people who do have ADHD to have unrealistic expectations."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Your comment has literally 8 insults in it, and the rest of it is you making up insults that were never made to you.

But as a pro-tip, if you think that your medication is the sole reason that you're not a 'failure' (like we all are, despite you knowing nothing about us), then you may still have some important work to do. ADHD, its symptoms, and its effects on people do not constitute failure. Medication will not make anyone's life a success: only people can do that, and only illegal drugs or scams promise it. That is what needs changing."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"When you have the same experience and education and background I do, then maybe you can be qualified to make statements. Right now, you're just talking out of your rear.

And I never said it was all medication, there was a lot of hard work I did as well.  But the stigma people like you spew out there needs to stop. Get an education, maybe some clinical experience under your belt and then maybe you will come close to being able to have a conversation with me on the same level. Until then, keep your damaging trash to yourself."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,[deleted]
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,Because your body gets used to this type of stimulants while hopefully it still affects the brain. Energy / not falling asleep is not what these meds are for. There are antidepressants like Wellbutrin that are known for adding energy and stims like mondafinil that are used to treat narcolepsy. But low energy can have a lot of medical reasons and there are many treatment options. You should really followup with your doc and make sure to get to the bottom of it.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"That is what amphetamines do to everybody. That energy and focus is what non-adhd people feel when they take amphetamines.

Nothing personal, but whenever I see those 'omg I just took literal amphetamines for the first time and I feel so great!' posts I always wonder why they didn't do ANY research into what meds do."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,I had noticed my skin was drier but put it down to winter and central heating. I drink plenty of water so I’m not dehydrated.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"side effects are usually from the wrong med or the wrong dose.

you’ll want to try out an amphetamine based med and a methylphenidate based med to determine which works better for u. From what i gather ppl are split 50/50 on it.

Personally I need amphetamine based, concerta was bad for me didn’t help made me foggy headed snd liek emotionally numb, then tried vyvanse, worked a lot better than concerta, but it was just like eh yeah i mean it’s better but nothin crazy. then adderall XR, worked pretty good but nothin special. then finally adderall ir, 10mg, works amazing 

mood is stabilized i can focus, and direct my focus on what i need to and actively be able to switch focus easily, i have better impulse control, i’m more calm mentally and my thoughts are organized instead of my mind being flooded with lots of different thoughts and being mentally disorganized. It helps with my depression and anxiety pretty well too (those can be caused and/or worsened by adhd)

my adderall helps me in every aspect of my life pretty much, and very significantly too

beware tho, ime most doctors and psychs don’t really have that well of an understanding of adhd and treating it etc. First doc just gave up and sent me to a psych nurse practitioner cuz the concerta didn’t work, and he started me at the highest dose. i could go on,

but you’ll want to find wether u need the amphetamine based or methylphenidate based meds,

then once ur on a med that’s if ur ideal type, u want to try starting at the lowest dose, try it for a couple days maybe, then try the next dose, and so on. u should land on a dose that works good, and if u go a dose higher u get side effects and it dosent work as good, and if u go lower it won’t work as good. 

see i started with 5mg ir adderall, kinda worked but not that well, 10mg worked very well, 15mg good too but maybe a bit high, 20mg too much, feel some stimulation and i hyper focus, no high or euphoria or anything tho. so i concluded 10mg is my ideal dosage, after i got the 10s i did the rest of the experimenting on my own as no doc i’ve met really knows about this but this is the proper way to do it as u can find everywhere online, in articles and study’s written by docs and psychs etc.

u gotta do some of the work on ur own, but the docs will help get u started by diagnosing u and getting u started on a med"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,I asked myself the same question if it was worth it for a while. Procrastinated it for too long and finally decided I could always stop again and should not withold myself from a possible solution. Now been on meds for a week and I'm glad I did it.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I totally get this. I hate that we think this way, but we do. I'm sure that really our doctors,  at least mine, wants me to feel better. Still, I'm constantly paranoid he's going to think I'm faking the whole thing. So annoying. Hang in there."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Personally I’m on 27mg Concerta and I feel it has little to no impact in my day to day. I started on 10 mg Ritalin, went to 20, then switched to Concerta as I felt a longer-acting med would be safer (I’m in recovery, six years). I feel like maybe an amphetamine based med would work better for me, but I’m also nervous to ask. My dr is not great (I use donefirst)."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,7 months
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I used to struggle with studying for high school exams massively. 

I was in the military and my room was never the worst but it was by no means the best day to day. Whenever there was a block inspection of the accomodation I would always be cleaning last monute through the night. A degree of perfectionism when I do undertake something alongside heavy procrastination is not good 😂"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Oddly, doing laundry is the one thing I can easily do now. That in itself makes the meds worth it!"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"have you found that that affects its duration? I eat a lot so i tend to eat my meds with food, but when i have tried doing it without food i feel like it passes through me really quickly."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,I’ve done this . It’s brilliant . Let’s make sure we remember to have a good breakfast though !
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,Interrupting your sleep cycle doesn't sound healthy.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Yeah for sure! The second part of that works best when I’m just not feeling it. I pretty rarely do that, but I find it’s a lot easier to physically start when I’m not fully committing to doing the whole task. 

It’s a weird mental trick I use a lot when I just have no energy to do anything. Like for example if I need to work out but I’d rather do literally anything else, I’ll be like “okay we are going to physically go to the gym and work out for at least 5 minutes and if you still don’t want to be here we can leave.” I think I’ve left maybe once in two years lol"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Pro strat: get some external dopamine. I like art and shiny pens. So if I do my journal for a week, I get to buy a new shiny art pen to use in my journal! That’s the literal only way I keep up with it"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"This is another one I’m sorry about, but regular exercise is HUGE when it comes to managing ADHD. But like…don’t go to the gym if you hate it. I find any sport that gets your adrenaline up or is stimulating in some other way helps a lot. I do a lot of skiing personally. Rock climbing is another great one if you have a gym nearby. Nature walks are also super stimulating and not terrifying if you want to do something more lowkey. 

I also schedule executive function mishaps into my day if that makes sense? So if I’m going somewhere, I plan on leaving 30 minutes before I actually NEED to. I never actually end up leaving 30 minutes early, but I do leave right on time lmao. I also get in bed like 1-2 hours before I actually need to go to sleep because I know that’s how long it takes for my brain to wind down."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Oooh, turning the bottle upside down is a good one!! I also take my pills 35 mins before my wake up alarms!"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"the amount of times i was told i was just lazy was insane. i think one of my hugest ""wtf"" moments was when i took my medicine one saturday morning and completed my homework in less than an hour... i went the whole day feeling like i had done nothing productive at all, because usually that amount of work would have taken me maybe 5 hours to complete... definitely made me realize how hard i was working before and that it really was not necessary at all"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,I hope it will!
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I like it. Mind you I take 80mg Straterra and 20mg Vyvanse. Straterra helped me with focus a little. That's why I have a small dose of stimulants to improve focus. Straterra is a NNRI (norepinephrine reputation inhibitor.) So it helps boost norepinephrine levels which plays a part in attention but also overall mood. It did more for my anxiety, depression and bad moods more than anything."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Just saying because you said you were looking at Strattera and Adderall to definitely try Adderall and Methylphenidate at first, before looking at Strattera. Methylphenidate has a bad rep with non ADHD people because it’s less tolerated and not as recreational and more therapeutic. Also as of today Ritalin hasn’t show to possess the slight nephrotoxic and cardiovascular effects of Adderall. Not trying to scare users of Adderall but it’s definitely something to keep in mind, when you’re taking multiple medications or have preexisting health problems like hypertension."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I’ve heard of multiple studies that suggest the exact opposite. [This one from Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/news/2018-07-20/adhd) showed no improvement in cognition, and actually impaired working memory, in non-adhd college students who use stimulant meds. And [this longitudinal study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27469455/) showed no increase in GPA (or detectable advantages over their peers) in students who used non-prescription stimulant meds. 

I’m not saying that the effects are complete opposite, nor do I disagree that the “euphoria” feeling can happen for both adhd and non-adhd stimulant users, but your statement that “it will at least temporarily increase most peoples function” is definitely up for debate."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,I think they are referring to psychiatrists that state that ADHD is a myth and is more of an issue for kids and not adults and that most issues are solved without stimulants. My psychiatrist said this to me yesterday. They are not my psychiatrist any longer.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Hey friend, I'm writing a book on Dopamine (well, ""writing"", err, I'm doing research!  yes thats it) and something like Adderall shouldn't be causing euphoria, unless it interacts with and releases endogenous opioids or somehow binds to those receptors.  Dopamine increase doesn't stimulate euphoria, but euphoria does stimulate dopamine release!

Sometimes we can mistake high motivational salience for something akin to euphoria, but real euphoria is a very sensory experience (though generated chemically, not by our actual senses)

What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,10 is hefty? But it starts at 5mg? And my doctor said start with 5 x2 a day and can go to 10 x2. Isn’t this just one step up?
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Oh interesting, I never knew the difference between the isomers aside from potency, good to know. Adderall always did feel slightly more intense than Dexedrine, guess that could explain it"

What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,Oh gosh the palpitations sound awful. Thanks for sharing.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,It's almost like I've developed certain OCD tendencies to solve these little problems. I'll find myself checking my pockets for phone wallet keys several times even though I just confirmed I that they are indeed in my pockets
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Yeah! I've started using that too if I'm out and about and using voice to text helps get it out quickly and I can go back and edit it. I should have been doing this months ago, I feel like every therapy session is a trainwreck of what is on my mind at that moment and now I feel like I can have a plan"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I guess? I've had anxiety problems for over 10 years. It gives me literal panic attacks when I get that feeling of not being able to trust my memory and having to go back for something like my pets could get out and not come home. It's happened in the past and was the same dreadful feeling but my cat was found so I was able to relax. My cat who got out last month has still not come home. It's a terrible feeling because I am still actively trying to find him. I can't do too much without getting sucked into the anxious feeling. So yeah, I will go back and check everytime because you never know"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Yeah... Too **much** insulin is deadly FAST, whereas not enough *usually* won't kill you relatively immediately."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I don't need pro tips from someone like you.  Not sure why you think you are qualified to do so.  I doubt you have the background or education to make such a statement.  Again, sorry you can't get your act together, and are buying into the stigma.  It's bullshit and you and others like you need to be shut down. Quick."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"How on earth do you know my qualifications? I'm currently doing my second masters, this one in Artificial Intelligence (previous one was Applied Linguistics, bachelors was Law). I don't judge people by education, and try not to do so by intelligence, but holy cow you are really not in a good position to assume you're more qualified than even Johnny Average.

Genuinely curious who you surround yourself with, if they're so far below average intelligence that you have got used to assuming you're smart? But I can definitely see why you felt you owe all of your success to drugs. 

You started off insulting and moved pretty quickly to asserting your superiority by means of your bachelors. There is nothing to be gained in continuing this conversation. But for what its worth, I think if and when you decide to prioritise happiness and relationships and morality as the most important factors in anyone's life, I still think you'll discover you've been doing a hell of a lot better than you realise right now."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"So I've read ""You Mean I'm Not Lazy, Stupid, or Crazy?"" and heard that ""Taking Charge of Adult ADHD"" by Russell Barkley (or anything else by him) is great. It can be hard to find books that aren't oriented to parents with children that have ADHD.."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,I don’t have narcolepsy. I’m just nocturnal. I sleep during the day and am awake and active at night. The meds woke me up and switched my sleep schedule back to normal.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,???
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Good advice to start low and work up. All doctors should do this. I started out on Adderall Xr 10 mg. First day was a miracle. After a week it was just okay. My doc had me stay there for about 3 weeks. Upped it by 5 or 10mg. Every month we meet and adjust as needed. I'm currently up to 40mg. Weirdly,  I don't see much, if any,  difference between when I first started and now. I really need to keep a log,  I think."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"“mood is stabilized i can focus, and direct my focus on what i need to and actively be able to switch focus easily, i have better impulse control, i’m more calm mentally and my thoughts are organized instead of my mind being flooded with lots of different thoughts and being mentally disorganized. It helps with my depression and anxiety pretty well too (those can be caused and/or worsened by adhd)

my adderall helps me in every aspect of my life pretty much, and very significantly too”

This has been my experience as well. After the first week of superpowers levels out and balances, my anxiety and depression are better, my ability to resume/remember tasks after distractions is much better, and I can regulate my moods much better! After my meds wear off in the evening this is very noticeable, and possibly worse at those hours than before meds. I am very quick to anger at the smallest thing at night. We are housebreaking a new puppy who is often the subject of my overly loud shouts (overly loud for the circumstance).


(Sorry, not sure how to reference quotes on mobile.)"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,Very well said
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,Thanks for all the good info!  Taking notes from all these replies for my appointment.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Well said; I’ll add that all meds have side effects long term, even when taking the right dose . You need to monitor your health . Specially on stimulants . They age you faster , affect heart and blood pressure skin and hair."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"The only question I have about this with trying amphetamine and methylphenidate to see which works best for you is.. what if you're in the UK? Adderall is illegal here and I think Amphetamine in general is illegal. Makes me curious that if methylphenidate doesn't work, you're just screwed ahaha"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Not really? I normally take it between 6-8am and it’ll wear off between 2-3pm. I started doing it that way because my go-to morning meal contains citric acid which can make Vyvanse less effective. 

To be fair, I also am on a pretty high dose of inhaled steroids for my asthma. They’re also stimulants and rev me up a bit on top of the Vyvanse"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I mean you don’t have to go back to sleep? I make sure to get like 6-8 hours by the first alarm. I’m going to be laying in bed till my meds kick in anyways, this just offsets that time so I’m not late every morning lol."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,What I wouldn't give to have gotten my diagnosis in my late teens instead of late 30s.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,I have RLS and she told me she isn't sure how a stimulant would (or wouldn't) affect that.  I'm on gabapentin for the RLS and it's under control.  But the RLS is why she was leaning more toward strattera but is open to letting me try either. (ETA also knowing adderall will require more frequent checkups)
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Thank you, I will make sure to bring this up with my doctor."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"That’s the important nuance, I think. The statement about stimulants is true - that’s why 60% of Americans drink coffee every day and why people who don’t have ADHD abuse the meds for productivity - but it does not mean that ADHD isn’t real or that stimulants don’t treat an issue that people with ADHD have. 

It seems important to be able to acknowledge and hold both of those truths."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"wut? Adderall absolutely can cause euphoria, ESPECIALLY in neurotypicals and ppl with no tolerance."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Have you tried experimenting using different medications with your doctor? Also dosage is important, I went up to 50 mg Vyvanse, I have minimal side effects but on doses below I wasn't feeling as much improvement as I am now. 

I also got very lucky with my job and my master's program. Before I went back to school things were rough, and if I was in the same situation then starting meds I don't think I would have had the same improvement. So it's a combination of medication and environment for sure"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,It’s only 10mg xr. I was on strattera previously high dose twice daily and it did bubkus for my problems but did give me a bunch of weird side effects. I know it’ll even out in the next six weeks or so but I take tolerance breaks every week so hopefully it’ll avoid that
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I’m taking XR, my doctor won’t prescribe me IR. I started on 10 mg 4 months ago but now I’m at 20. It hasn’t been as effective lately :/"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Listen to your doctor, who knows your medical history, and not some random redditor."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Well., the palpatations arent as bad as i used to have them years ago. Kinda mild. But still freak me out.

Also keep in mind I'm just one person and this isn't to say any of this is related to dexedrine or that other people experience this or even if they do that you would feel anything like that.

Best to just discuss meds with your doctor. And I should really just do the same!"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,The ADHD panic when you’re in line to buy something or at a restaurant so you have to check that you have your card 1000 times
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I know that feeling. It's like I have so much I want to say or tell them about progress I've made since the last visit and what I think could be better, but just can't remember all of it when I sit down to talk about it or the subject gets changed and a few minutes later I forget about it and the conversation goes on. 

I use voice to text all the time but its never perfect and I spend too much time correcting what I say lol"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"So, you just admitted you were not qualified to make the statements you made. Thank you!"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"It's entirely possible that it will be enough to ground your internal clock, even if the energized feeling goes away.
 With each dosage increase you get that feeling again for a few days and it will mostly go away. Thats what this post is about, not to chase the feeling but use the window to create good systems. The meds do have effect long term, but it's a lot more subtle.

Your case is different as you need to address the sleep cycles. I see that you're working with your doc on it, that's the right thing to do, there are various options. Also there's a sub reddit for that, maybe they have some useful feedback there as well."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"it’s sad how little so many doctors know about adhd and the meds used to treat it. 

If you are at the correct dosage and on the right med you shouldn’t build any tolerance to the therapeutic effects, only the euphoria will quickly go away if u even feel any(i dont).

the whole 3-4 years i’ve been on adderall ir 10mg x 3 / day it has been just as effective the whole time, no negative side effects.

there was a time where i’d take 20mg and get energized but quickly built a tolerance to that. but taking the 10s i don’t build any tolerance and it stays working just as good and no side effects. Also even though i was energized off the 20s i still work better off the 10s just being calm and focused and i can get shit done well and work just as fast if not faster, but not forced to. i can move around if i want and work hard or i can straight up lay down and relax off my meds"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I started xr 30 and I'm starting to see the benefits after being on it 10x2 daily, then xr20, XR30. Finally getting somewhere! But it's all about self motivation after that. I honestly think I'll need to get to 40 before I'm actually in the zone. I started keeping a log a few days to track the behavior of the Adderall, but it's also been helpful in seeing how often I get nauseous from taking my guanfacine. I've actually started eating breakfast and seeing how I'm feeling on a day to day basis"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"I hate everyone when my XR wears off around 5 pm, simultaneously around the same time I get home from work to my husband and kids. I end up irrationally angry. My doctor prescribed a 10 mg Adderall to take around 4:30, and it helps ease that transition and get me through my kids' bedtimes. Granted, it also may be making my insomnia worse if I am not careful about habits, routines, caffeine intake, etc. But I would honestly take having to be more mindful and careful about my routines than dealing with who I am to my family when my medication is wearing off."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"yup truly when u find the right med and dosage there is a major difference.

and to quote u just do a “>” before the line of text ur quoting

ex:

> quote"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"just curious, I have Bipolar and take meds for over 25 years around the clock 24/7.  Why don't ADHD peeps take meds around the clock?  It seems they go of and go back on???  If I did that with Bipolar meds it would screw up everything then I would have to get back on track asap."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"i’ve been on adderall for bout 4 years still works as good as when i started, no negative side effects, heart rate and blood pressure have been perfect every time. EKG perfect both at the beginning and later on after being on it for 4 years. 

From the studies i’ve seen therapeutic stimulant doses for adhd do not cause any kind of long term harm and are actually very safe."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"yeah that is pretty shitty, idk why amphetamine is illegal there.. 

unfortunately in general though many docs and ppl in general don’t understand adhd or how to properly treat it etc. 

Like in medical school doctors are only required to learn the bare minimum about it bascially just reading the DSM-5 diagnosis criteria. 

And all the information is available on the internet, in articles and such written by psychs and docs who are experts in adhd."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,That makes a lot of sense now. Thanks for tip.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,or late 50s.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,I see. Well stick with it. It takes about 3 months to start working properly and any side-effects to go away. A lot of people stop taking it before the 3 month mark.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"The only way it could cause euphoria is by triggering a release of endogenous opioids.  I mean, it's possible, but that really isn't something it's supposed to be doing.  If it is, then I'm happy to be wrong.  Adderall has effects broader than just on dopamine obviously, like norepirepherine for instance, but as far as I'm aware, it doesn't release endorphins.

One possibility is that it is an indirect effect somehow.

edit: Welp, here we go down another research rabbit hole.  Wish me luck."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,[deleted]
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,However in my head it makes sense to check several times. Because things seem to disappear around me into a black hole
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,Thanks. I’m just so new to these meds and just want to feel better. Not really sure what to expect I guess. Or how it will go in the long run.
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Thanks for this. While I don't feel energized I am able to focus more than I was before meds, my head is silent and I don't have anxiety. I'm able to get stuff done if I can get going and I feel better than I have in YEARS!  I probably just need to work more on changing habits. I'm going to keep in mind though what you've said,  so thanks!!"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Maybe I will ask soon. I have only been on meds for 2 months and I am cautious about any doctor thinking I am a pill-seeker. I hate that there is a stigma around the meds that allow us to feel normal, just because they are dangerous to people who don’t actually need them. :/"
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"Pretty safe yes, but most people notice the blood pressure spike after a certain age ( as told by a doctor ) , and they look older by the time they’re in their late 20s. I started in my 40s so I noticed things more quickly . The long-long term effects are not known because studies are only 4 weeks long and it’s the first generation that will grow up taking it for decades . So it seems pretty safe , but it affects circulation by narrowing your blood vessels , that’s why many of us develop cold or painful fingers and toes. Also sometimes gout , since it affects connective tissue, and hair thinning and loss . Not everybody all the time , but these are common side effects . Bottom line , keep seeing your doctors. Adults on stimulants is new territory . As much as I like Vyvanse and my friends their adderall , it is what it is ."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"There was another commenter just above me saying how Adderall has a much higher cardiovascular load than Dexedrine and Vyvanse, so maybe you could try switching to one of those (it has to do with the amphetamine isomers, Adderall is 3:1 d vs l-amph. and Dexedrine and Vyvanse are pure d-amph."
What I wish someone had told me when I started stimulants,"It's a process finding the right medication, and I too was/am nervous of seeming like I had ulterior motives. Thankfully my doctor is pretty open about medication and has been patient throughout the process. I think finding a doctor who is familiar with ADHD treatment is important, and so is using your voice to advocate for what you need. (Now if only the insurance companies would stop giving us the runaround...)   


Best of luck on finding what works best for you!"

"If Adderall kinda sucks, but amphetamines work better than methylphenidate for you, then you may want to look into Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine)","Actually switched to Dexedrine as of this morning, I don’t believe I’d ever heard of anyone taking it. Hopeful that it will work better than adderall, ritalin, Strattera for me."
"If Adderall kinda sucks, but amphetamines work better than methylphenidate for you, then you may want to look into Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine)","Omg I tried dexedrine (generic version) today for the first time and it was soooo much better than the generic adderall I was getting before. I got it cause my pharmacy had been out of my prescription for 2 weeks now, but my doctor refused to up my adderall dosage to 15mg (only one in stock) since it’s addictive. But I’m glad he didn’t cause this straight dextroamphetamine feels way better"
"If Adderall kinda sucks, but amphetamines work better than methylphenidate for you, then you may want to look into Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine)",It does work way better than adderall for me. This is much euphoric that adderall. And I feel overall more at peace and zoned in when taking it.

"If Adderall kinda sucks, but amphetamines work better than methylphenidate for you, then you may want to look into Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine)",I don’t think it’s as potent.  I’m on 40 mg Dexedrine was on 40 mg add
"If Adderall kinda sucks, but amphetamines work better than methylphenidate for you, then you may want to look into Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine)",I don’t like Dexedrine 😩😩 I’m an adderall user usually but with this shortage the pharmacy gave me it instead… I sadly feel nothing
"If Adderall kinda sucks, but amphetamines work better than methylphenidate for you, then you may want to look into Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine)",I’m having to take other things since the shortage and I can’t find anything that works for me like Adderall. Everything else I’ve tried has had no effect or change with me which is confusing and exhausting. My hope for an alternative feels impossible.
"If Adderall kinda sucks, but amphetamines work better than methylphenidate for you, then you may want to look into Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine)",Strattera is no where near how this drug acts. It’s a non-stimulant. I hope it works for you
"If Adderall kinda sucks, but amphetamines work better than methylphenidate for you, then you may want to look into Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine)",Also my local CVS technician never heard of dexedrine either. She kept thinking it was adderall. That’s how obscure it is.
"If Adderall kinda sucks, but amphetamines work better than methylphenidate for you, then you may want to look into Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine)","Your doctor sounds like a paranoid one. 15mg dosage for adderall is not a lot, atleast for a lot of people. I get prescribed 60mg a day. 

And since dexedrine is more potent than adderall it’s kinda ironic he’d switch you to that and not increase adderall"

"If Adderall kinda sucks, but amphetamines work better than methylphenidate for you, then you may want to look into Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine)","Yeah he was pretty weird, but I also had just switched to having him as my doctor from another one, so maybe he wanted to be more cautious? I don't know though. 

I think he felt bad and gave in cause I was sounding very helpless and lowkey tearing up during the call lol. 

Cause at first, he was basically like ""You gotta wait because I can't just call every pharmacy and ask if they have stock cause it will take hours"" and ""If I do it for you, then I have to do it for every patient asking for adderall"". 

But then like 20 minutes later they called back and said they'd give me Dexedrine. Thankfully"
"If Adderall kinda sucks, but amphetamines work better than methylphenidate for you, then you may want to look into Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine)",Generic. My Psy moved me from 10 to 20. I was expecting the usual amephatemine salts. But got the dextro instead.
"If Adderall kinda sucks, but amphetamines work better than methylphenidate for you, then you may want to look into Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine)",What's the highest ir dex tablet? and what's the daily limit for dex. 60mg?

"If Adderall kinda sucks, but amphetamines work better than methylphenidate for you, then you may want to look into Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine)",You may want to try to get Zenzedi because it’s better than generics. It has a filler in it that increases bioavailability.
"If Adderall kinda sucks, but amphetamines work better than methylphenidate for you, then you may want to look into Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine)",30mg and there’s no highest limit although it’s recommended to be 40.mg a day
"If Adderall kinda sucks, but amphetamines work better than methylphenidate for you, then you may want to look into Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine)",Yes instant release. I actually had to use my adderall reserve for a week because of delivery issues and it was horrible. I forgot how much physical effects adderall gave me while giving me a headache and barely working. I’m back on Zenzedi now and it feels so much cleaner and my body doesn’t feel all twitchy. I feel a lot more focused now

I've noticed that my Adderall IR (Teva generic) has been wildly inconsistent and doesn't even have the same appearance that it used to (many have reported the same). 

If I were to try Zenzedi, is the dose equivalent to Adderall? I've been talking 15 mg TID of Teva generic Addy. So would it be the same for Zenzedi?"

Zenzedi is 25% stronger than adderall. 3.75mg zenzedi = 5mg adderall for reference."

"If Adderall kinda sucks, but amphetamines work better than methylphenidate for you, then you may want to look into Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine)","Thanks so much, it’s been pretty incredible to feel. I’ve just found there to be so much less friction around the very same activities which would previously trip me up- planning, timeliness, follow-through. At present, all the things I had always hoped a medication would do, and no observable concerning side effects. 

So glad it’s been a similar experience for you. What do you think you’ve been able to accomplish now that you wouldn’t have previously? (Even the fact that you thought to follow back up with me speaks huge volumes. People in this sub understand how ,UC that means.)

I’m on the generic at present, haven’t trialed Zenzedi yet. Is that what you are on? Both adderall and Ritalin formulations for me were 1) too inconsistent to be useful, after an initial honeymoon phase 2) would often result in me feeling super impatient with other people 3) would occasionally produce an uncomfortable physical anxiety and a dull headache. So basically, the opposite of my current experience- not very helpful in improving symptoms, but with some side effects that I didn’t love."
"If Adderall kinda sucks, but amphetamines work better than methylphenidate for you, then you may want to look into Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine)","I'm also reading posts that Sandoz IR has also gone downhill, both here on reddit and drugs.com. Have you had any recent experience with Sandoz IR? 

Also, is Zenzedi a tablet or capsule? I like the idea of something that feels like the old Teva Adderall, would you say that's a similar comparison? (Smooth, no big crash, no jitteriness or anxiety?) Heck, the old Tevas use to HELP my anxiety."

"If Adderall kinda sucks, but amphetamines work better than methylphenidate for you, then you may want to look into Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine)",Yup. Suntheanine is a good brand that's what i take.
"If Adderall kinda sucks, but amphetamines work better than methylphenidate for you, then you may want to look into Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine)","That’s great to hear it really working. Ever since I got on this drug I’ve been trying to educate other people on it that are on adderall. 

So I created my own company specializing in editing videos like weddings, corporate l, social media etc. after working for my fathers editing company for many years. I’ve been doing a lot of things I been wanted to do because I have the motivation and courage and focus. I was actually diagnosed as an adult so most of my life I felt like I was missing out on the drug I really needed but I’m glad I discovered it now early on into my adulthood. I just feel more like a functioning adult now. I am on brand name Zenzedi because it has a filler that the generics don’t which increases bioavailability and makes the drug kick in faster and last 1-2 hours longer. I also heard from some people that the generics feel weaker and less clean but I can’t verify that. And Zenzedi took away that jittery/physical anxiety feeling that I got from adderall."
"If Adderall kinda sucks, but amphetamines work better than methylphenidate for you, then you may want to look into Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine)","Oh dude, I guess you never heard of dexedrine (100% dextroamphetamine) before. I will tell you straight up that dexedrine (Zenzedi brand name is the best) is way better than adderall. Adderall has 75% percent dextroamphetamine and 25% levoamphetamine. Levoamphetamine is the weaker one and also the one that provides the nasty side of effects of jitteryness, physical anxiety, headaches, dry mouth, etc. Dextroamphetamine is 100% the more potent amphetamine and it feels very clean compared to adderall. It removes all previously stated adderall side effects and feels more potent and productive. It feels more in the background like a cerebral effect that just feels right. Come downs are much better with less side effects. 

Now I recommend name brand Zenzedi instead of generic dexedrine because this is one of those rare instances where the name brand is actually better than the generic. Zenzedi has a filler in it that increases bioavailability which makes it kick in faster and last about 1-2 hours longer than generic.

Zenzedi comes in tablets but they look pretty cool actually lol: https://i.imgur.com/m2VItz5.jpg"

No wonder you are spreading the gospel after finding what works for you.

I’ll talk to my psychiatrist about Zendedi at our next meeting. I will say that I’m noticing more of the side effects now, mostly some minor headaches, and it’s a bit harder to wind down for sleep than it was before. Still, I can absolutely work with those. 

Congrats on starting your own company! That must feel like a massive achievement, as is the victory of feeling ,ore like a functioning adult."
"If Adderall kinda sucks, but amphetamines work better than methylphenidate for you, then you may want to look into Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine)","Excellent. So if my math is correct, those 7.5 mg triangles (very cool looking) would be equivalent to 10 mg of Adderall IR (you're pretty sure about 3.75 mg of Zenzedi equalling 5 mg of Adderall?). 

I took 10 mg of Adderall IR TID (three times daily) for years until a couple of years ago, when the Teva seemed to go downhill. Then I started breaking 20 mg IR Teva Adderalls into 15 mg, taken three times a day. The ""equivalent"" dose of that in Zenzedi would be 11.25, which isn't an option. 

Perhaps I could get my doctor to prescribe 7.5 mg of Zenzedi five times per day, to equal the 45 mg dose of Adderall I've been taking for the past few years? Or would that cost a fortune? Is it pricey? I'm definitely going to give it a go. Just need to figure out the dose for me."

"If Adderall kinda sucks, but amphetamines work better than methylphenidate for you, then you may want to look into Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine)",Well 5 hour energy has tyrosine in it so that's what's helping with the energy/alertness/ focus.  I'm just sticking with whet I know works for now.  It's not a miracle by any means but it helps when i combine it with theanine.
"If Adderall kinda sucks, but amphetamines work better than methylphenidate for you, then you may want to look into Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine)","I also get the side effects you describe, but i always hydrate with a lot of water daily so that always helps and I avoid acidic drinks like coffee, soda, apple juice and orange juice. My tolerance is different but I take 20mg 3x a day and while I can stay up at night, it is easy for me to go to sleep, especially if i wind down with melatonin, Benadryl or even some THC tincture. If I keep my last dose of the day before 5pm I shouldn’t have issues with sleep. 

Stimulants are still stimulants at the end of the day so I think it’s expected to have some kind of side effects like headaches. And thank you for the congratulations. It’s always on my mind now which kind of sucks but doesn’t at the same time. It’s just one of the things you have to expect when running something that’s all on you. But yea def try and get some Zenzedi and see if it will be any better for you. Good sleep of course is necessary. I notice the days with least amount of side effects are those where I wake up not feeling like death lol"

"If Adderall kinda sucks, but amphetamines work better than methylphenidate for you, then you may want to look into Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine)",I think the B12 is more for boosting mood aswell. 5 hour energy just makes you energized. That b12 drink reminds me of when I first started taking adderall and got euphoria but to a lesser extent
"If Adderall kinda sucks, but amphetamines work better than methylphenidate for you, then you may want to look into Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine)","So I just realized that currently, I'm on the dextroamphetamine SR. My doc is on board for trialling the immediate release formulation- whether or not the pharmacy can/will fill as Zenzedi or the generic appears to be more of a pharmacy issue, so I'll have to follow up with them on Monday.   


I'm a pretty routine caffeine user, and I did notice that dropping from 2 to 3 cups of coffee per day made a big difference. Introducing magnesium before bed really helped, too. I might have to cut back on the coffee even further, seems like I have a good deal of tinkering in my near future. Definitely need to make sure to stay on top of my hydration and exercise as well.

rebound anxiety on dexedrine,"I'm really sorry you feel this way, anxiety sucks. This could be a ""normal"" side effect when starting a new drug. If it is tolerable for you, you can try to wait it out and see if it gets better once your body gets used to the medication. If not you should probably talk to your doctor. I had similar problems with Ritalin, the side effects outweighs the benefit so I don't take Ritalin anymore. Now I'm on Vyvanse and have issues with rebound anxiety just like you described. But the benefit is still there so my doctor and I decided to stay on the medication and find ways to manage the anxiety better. She's looking into antidepressant/anxiety meds and I at the moment  try to be aware what the cause of the anxiety is and be extra gentle to myself. I allow myself to just chill and do what calms me down. Early evening nap? Watching comfort films? Hell yeah."
rebound anxiety on dexedrine,Any updates? I’m also experiencing some anxiety when meds wear off
rebound anxiety on dexedrine,it went away when i continued to use it! although i was only on dexedrine for about 2 weeks before my doctor decided to try me on adderall. i started today on 10mg and i think i prefer it. hopefully the anxiety gets better for you too

I did take 10mg as a top off dose at 5pm when I was in university to avoid the horrid crash that would happen when the Vyvanse wore off. I remember liking the Dexedrine a lot more. it lasted at least 4-6 hour? I just know I never experienced a crash from the Dexedrine and never noticed it wearing off at night. But that’s with whatever remaining Vyvanse was in my system so not sure if it’ll be the same without. Plus I’m assuming if it’s just Dexedrine I’m taking it’ll be more than 10 mg 🤣"

Lower than 25mg Dexedrine was never that effective to me at all, hence why I moved up to 30mg which made the difference. 

Regardless, even when 25mg and below I would have crashes.

As for Vyvanse, the opposite is the case for me, Vyvanse would make me crash harder than Dexedrine, anyway."

Dexedrine - close but not quite right. ,"Your body is unique, as are your needs. Just because someone experienced something from treatment or medication does not guarantee that you will as well. Please do not take this as an opportunity to review any substances. Peer support is welcome.

My psychologist apologised to me today,"Yeah when I hear about people getting tested for ADHD I know nothing about that because when I was diagnosed 20 years ago how it went was I went in and I told the guy my symptoms, I told him everything I had tried in the past which was basically just anti-anxiety medication and SSRIs Because I was accused of being depressed because I couldn’t get motivated. He sent me off with a weeks worth of Adderall and told me to come back next week. When I came back next week and told him how I finally hung up all the pictures in my apartment that I had moved into a year and a half ago , and how much happier I was, he clapped his hands and he said “Yep I knew you had ADHD.”

I’m really worried for newly diagnosed people or people not diagnosed yet. The same thing is happening to ADHD patients that happened to chronic pain patients. Everybody says over prescribing is happening so nobody’s going to get any medication and it’s terrible. Just because other people like to abuse certain meds doesn’t mean that people who need it shouldn’t have it"
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Well done to your psychologists being open minded

Changing one's mind is difficult, even for psychologists."
My psychologist apologised to me today,I hate the “over diagnosed” bullshit. does it not EVER occur to these people that this condition was CHRONICALLY under diagnosed and people are just finally learning about it
My psychologist apologised to me today,Moral of the story is doctors are people who are not above bias.
My psychologist apologised to me today,[deleted]
My psychologist apologised to me today,"I was diagnosed when I was 7. I'm 40 now and have been back on meds for about 3 ish years. I'm fairly functional, at least I seem that way to people outside lol

I attribute my high functioning to my son. He's 22 now, but has aspergers. When he was young, there was just no other way to manage than by his rules. And by his rules, I mean order. He needed routine and he didn't like surprises. Yea, things still got chaotic sometimes, but life was easier for everyone if he knew the plan or if I gave him as much warning as possible about routine changes. 

My mind is still a shit show and it took me 5 months to schedule that Dr. Appt I needed so bad, but I can contain a lot of the crazy when stuff needs to get done lol

Edit: Realized I completely forgot the main thing I wanted to say! Lol I am extremely affected as a woman, mother, human by my ADHD. Just because my life isn't visibly collapsing around me, doesn't mean I'm not struggling constantly. I'm sorry you had to find a work around to get meds, but it's refreshing to hear of a doc that admits to their mistake and tries to do better going forward!!"
My psychologist apologised to me today,Please give me the secret to high function performance.  Cheers
My psychologist apologised to me today,This is amazing!! Seeing people change their mind and be open minded is always nice
My psychologist apologised to me today,"I think the moral is that mental health care still relies disproportionately on subjective views of rhe person you're talking to, and, that whatever the proportion of people misdiagnosed with ADHD is there's likely to be some percentage of people who are told they're fine when they're really do have it.

It reminds me of a health issue my mum had. She'd been diagnosed with breast cancer twice within 4 years. The third time, she'd gone to the doctor with an unusually persistent cough and wanted to get checked to make sure it wasn't cancer. The doctor laughed and said there's no way it was cancer but that if it put her mind at ease he'd send her for tests. Turned out she was right, the cancer was back. 

Thing is, the person she'd been years before then would have left the surgery feeling silly for worrying. She pushed it, and it gave her another few years of life to spend with us.

It's good you got an apology, but it proves that, ultimately, their view was just an opinion that showed a bias against what seems to have been the correct diagnosis im glad you're feeling better with the treatment!"
My psychologist apologised to me today,"I have a friend, a psychotherapist, apologize for her behavior when I told her I have ADHD. 

I was really glad, because her reaction really hurt. But I'm also happy I opened her mind and she's done more research into it."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"'high functioning' is a terrible filter to exclude people from being tested. I made it through law school, but undiagnosed ADHD meant it was a constant nightmare, sitting amidst a stack of books you need to be working through to write a paper that was so perfect in your head but now will be, at best, a crappy rushed last minute excuse. And you can see yourself doing it yet again. And after all that I never got it together to take the bar exam. That's some expensive high functioning."
My psychologist apologised to me today,At least they apologised and acknowledged it. Maybe they might listen or notice it in other patients of theirs who are high functioning
My psychologist apologised to me today,"I’m sorry your psychologist was skeptical. That never feels good. 

I was in therapy for years, and after getting diagnosed and medicated, my therapist and I both agreed that I didn’t need to see her any more. My thoughts and emotions are so much more stable. It can really make a huge difference in quality of life."
My psychologist apologised to me today,I've often felt that if it weren't for ADD I'd be dangerously competent.
My psychologist apologised to me today,"This strikes me hard as I just went through my assessment and the psychiatrist kept saying how she doesn't think I have ADHD because I got an engineering degree and has a good job. How lack of motivation is just ""like anyone else"" and how if I can't produce my report cards from 20+ years ago she can't believe I had adhd. Oh well."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"I find it weird that psychologist don't understand that you can have issues and still function. A lot of people have high functioning anxiety, depression, alcoholism, among other additions or disorders. I have a friend who has high functioning anxiety and depression along with ADHD."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Well done! My psychiatrist was astonished how I had made it to where I was when he diagnosed me at 30. The negative feedback we get through out our life can be a very tough teacher and some of us try and manage to compensate for our shortcomings. I believe medication abuse is on the rise as well so professionals might be getting very conscious about diagnosis. 

I’m proud of your determination and celebrating your achievement with you 🎉"
My psychologist apologised to me today,hey!! happy for you!!!! :))
My psychologist apologised to me today,"High functioning ADHD fucking sucks. I have performed well at every job I've had and was rewarded with nothing but burnout and exhaustion, and the occasional ""you need to work on your soft skills"". 

Finally with medication I can actually have breathing room and relax at home, while still being active and productive at work. What a fucking change."
My psychologist apologised to me today,I sure hope your psychologist shares this experience with their colleagues and uses it to push back against skepticism in the future.
My psychologist apologised to me today,"That's nice to hear. Like it would've been nicer to have the psychologist support you from the get go no matter what would've been the result but at least they are able to adapt. And with support I don't mean saying ""Yes"" to everything their clients bring up but to take their struggles serious even if they can't see them in the way the client feels impacted by them. Plus ruling out things can also be helpful."
My psychologist apologised to me today,Green flag
My psychologist apologised to me today,"After being medicated, I realized that my entire life's driving force previously had been overwhelming anxiety. I finally was able to let a lot of that go, but when the Adderall shortage resulted in me going without them for 6 months, I realized I had no driving force outside of basic subsistence, and it was absolute hell. I'm attempting to stockpile them now in preparation for this year's great Adderall winter as I can't do that again."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"That’s wonderful for you!!!  
I had 2 dx’s, (including a recent RE-dx after extensive testing which I gave to my PCP), to which my PCP responded no way could I have ADHD because I’m a lawyer, and if I had focus issues it was due to chronic pain and trauma (my dx preceded both of those conditions by decades). Of course I pushed back that my success was due to the steady script of stimulants I’d been taking since the early 90’s that he was now giving me trouble about. 

He kept citing some study. I made him send it to me. It was about adult-onset ADHD being mostly just symptoms from other issues rather than actual ADHD. I read to him the giant disclaimer in the fucking abstract that this study was not relevant to anyone who had symptoms in childhood (I was dx’d at 5!), and then I fired his ass and told him he needs to learn how to read a damn study. 

Anyway I’m glad you had this kind of success and it’ll be amazing if they’re better informed for the next patient!!!"
My psychologist apologised to me today,"If you’re feeling bold, encourage your psychologist to do some continuing education. Their previous POV is decades outdated, and I’d be skeptical of them on other fronts of knowledge in the field too."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"I love when people think I’m high functioning. Lol no I just am immaculate at masking cause I grew up in a house where that was the only way to survive.  I spent most of my adult life being treated for RX resistant depression. Started on adhd meds haven’t had a deep depressive moment since. 

It really sucks that millennials are getting hit twice with this moral panic around medication. Once as kids that stopped a lot of folks from being treated. Now again as adults when they are attempting to get treated"
My psychologist apologised to me today,"I am a psychologist with ADHD, and got all the way through a doctoral program before I hit a wall trying to write my dissertation, which ended up taking two years longer than expected. I was diagnosed at that point, and could not believe how things changed for me following medication. The struggle is real, and there are many uninformed practitioners who don’t always have experience with how ADHD, Autism, and other learning differences can present. So glad you advocated for yourself, and have a provider who can be self-reflective and admit mistakes."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"I don't know why people assume smart & successful people can't have ADHD. You did what you had to succeed, but what people don't see is how much more effort it takes us than the average person to get there. Some of us can get by without it but, why should we go about life in a way that is needlessly more difficult when there are plenty of treatment options?"
My psychologist apologised to me today,"We can be high functioning, it just costs us everything"
My psychologist apologised to me today,"I mean, I'm on the regular meds, and they don't do much, but I really don't think doing PCP would help.... eyyy

&nbsp;

^^I'm ^^dumb ^^what's ^^PCP ^^im ^^this ^^context?"
My psychologist apologised to me today,"What is a PCP?

Edit: from Wikipedia, a Primary Care Physician is a word used locally within the USA. It’s roughly equivalent to General Practitioner in most countries."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Well done for pursuing the diagnosis  -  honestly, congratulations and all the best for your future"
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Good news. These people seem like level-headed and thoughtful people. Even with the extensive training for a psychologist they must surely be aware of where research is still catching up, and that some flexibility is required in a complicated field like this. Just my thought on this."
My psychologist apologised to me today,Glad they know. The locals here where I'm at better know too. Social involvement got a therapist that seems to not understand how the society behaved all these years before I met him. The system is the one that need to be careful.
My psychologist apologised to me today,"This is fantastic. Aside from the initial bump, it sounds like you have a good psychologist, willing to admit their mistakes and learn. This gives me hope. Thanks for sharing. Also, glad you advocated for yourself and got meds."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"I don't think you changed anyones views.

He has simply retreated from a position of skepticism regarding the recent upsurge in ""biological"" explanations for psychological problems, and their pharmaceutical solutions, such as ADHD for anxiety disorders and selfdestructive, selfsabitaging or addictive conducts. Which is a normal defensive reaction by someone who has no medical degree, and whos main bussiness is treating peoples minds thru therapy.
He did so, to be precise, in your particular case. Which doesn't mean he will do so in any other case, which will be equally unreasonable.

The moral of the story is that anything that treatens someone means of survival, personhood integrity or identity will at least provoke a defensive reaction, that would more or less meturely be adressed later on."
My psychologist apologised to me today,I am glad they were profesional enough to come back and apologize to you.  I have a professional degree and a career but that does jack for me when I can’t find my car keys for two hours or when I space and then suddenly realize I should have left to pick up my kid 20 minutes ago.
My psychologist apologised to me today,"I'm glad you got help and that your psychologist has recognized your issues!

I think many mental health professionals have far too many patients and too much work. Years ago when I first tried talk therapy (before ADHD diagnosis) the counselor.....didn't know what to do with me.  Career, house, wife, no alcoholism, no drug addictions, no history of violence.....

Compared to everyone else he saw 10+ hours a day all week, I had \*no\* problems.  I could see he was dumbfounded and just didn't know what to do with me, and my issues.  He had been triaging other people's disintegrating lives for so long he didn't have that One Big Issue to latch onto and address."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"there's not a tremendous amount of people who will actually do that, especially given they're in a position of power"
My psychologist apologised to me today,"The client is the expert of their situation! It’s rare to find people nowadays willing to admit when they were wrong and apologize. That’s how it should be.

Hopefully they share this experience (confidentially of course) with their colleagues to spread more awareness!"
My psychologist apologised to me today,"That's how science works - you learn from mistakes and failures. That they apologised to you sounds like the marker of a therapist who genuinely cares about you trusting them and therefore tried to re-establish that trust, which is the most important aspect of therapy imo."
My psychologist apologised to me today,It drives to the shops how many psychs seem to not know about masking
My psychologist apologised to me today,That's the sign of a good therapist.
My psychologist apologised to me today,"I hate the ""high functioning"" label. I'd often be given that label, as sure, it appears that way on the outside, but inside, it's a constant exhausting struggle with all the coping mechanisms and masking. Being high functioning doesn't mean you don't have the disorder or have it any less. I'm glad you got an apology and the help you need OP! 

*edit - added referring to OP"
My psychologist apologised to me today,"In almost 10years, I went to 5 different psychologists with always the same complain. “I sit in front of my laptop and I cannot work, and spend all days like this”

I would always hear: “You just don’t like your job” “You have anxiety” “You should do mindfulness” but no one could ever understand what I was really feeling… 
When I quit my master thesis because I didn’t have anything done:”You are just too perfectionist”

When I found out about Adhd (from a youtube suggestion) it all made sense.
I was diagnosed last year (after I looked for a psychiatrist with experience in ADHD) and finally my life has been easier, I started Vyanse and in the meantime I stopped the antidepressants that were not really improving :)

I really feel lucky I found that video describing my daily life and made me look for a specific type of help. 
Since I was always a very good student (expect my failed master thesis) and I was always able to do stuff under pressure and (luckily) got my “dream job”. No one ever thought about it :( :(
I feel that some psychologists are not informed about ADHD (or don’t believe in labels) and don’t take that into consideration. 
I hope that this changes in the future :)"
My psychologist apologised to me today,"I hear this! I'm ASD/ADHD but wasn't diagnosed until my late 30s. Just because I had a MS and a job doesn't mean my life wasn't a living nightmare. I finally hit burnout and now am unemployed. Mostly because the psychiatrist I'm still seeing does ADHD meds and *nothing* else. 

I tried to talk to her once about how the meds helped but only a little and could we look at different dosages or combinations. She basically accused me of drug seeking and wouldn't discuss it. I had to find out that autism was a thing and that I might have it by consuming dangerous levels of YouTube. 

It makes sense now why the meds sort of help. They calm the ADHD, but the ASD still means I'm not totally functional. I still haven't found anyone that works with adults. Damn near every search brings up autism and kids."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Honestly I think therapy for ADHD is a load of nonsense. The fact that a PCP can’t just diagnose and medically treat like any other condition is crazy to me. Refer to a therapist for strategies and management, sure - but medication for so many is life changing, even without long term therapy. Short term therapy worked wonders here, getting validation, learning coping strategies, and understanding how to live with ADHD - but after a few sessions there was little benefit. There are many other mental health issues that can go along with it, which would be much more helpful to seek therapy for (depression, anxiety, etc). Just my opinion and experience though."
My psychologist apologised to me today,Masters degree and just passed my board exam. Too high functioning my ass.
My psychologist apologised to me today,I got diagnosed with ADHD in the past couple of years too. I have issues with executive functioning but I wouldn't say I have ADHD. I seeing a psychiatrist for a different reason. The meds have made me a lot calmer too. I've been wondering if covid has had an impact on symptoms.
My psychologist apologised to me today,it's infuriating that people associate high functioning with not having ADHD. it makes providers look exceedingly ignorant.
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Psychologists are not psychiatrists, and I'm still miffed at how much time I wasted when what I needed was an ADHD prescription.

So many people are more interested in retaining the illusion of being experts than actually helping others."
My psychologist apologised to me today,">Not sure what the moral of the story is

It's that medical professionals are not infallible, but the good one's are willing to learn from their mistakes and change their opinion when presented with new information."
My psychologist apologised to me today,What a great story. Happy for you.
My psychologist apologised to me today,"He apologized because you looked calmer on medications?
I am happy for you, but all it took was for you to show another behavior?"
My psychologist apologised to me today,That's really awesome... I'm glad for you. 😊
My psychologist apologised to me today,This is what progress looks like - that’s so great!
My psychologist apologised to me today,"I am seriously glad they have the the brain to change their minds , met way too stubborn specialists for years"
My psychologist apologised to me today,Im sorry but whats with this dumb analysis that just because you managed to hang on to your job you can’t possibly have adhd? Like these people assume everyone with adhd is low iq or something? I really don’t get it…
My psychologist apologised to me today,Thanks for sharing good news!
My psychologist apologised to me today,"I got diagnosed earlier this year when I approached my doctor about it. Oddly enough, I would have never thought about it if it were two people I know didn't begin talking about it; their life experiences and symptoms were eerily similar to my own. 

We had similar tendencies - zoning out when talking to people, forgetfulness, anxiety, and depression - not being able to get shit done unless we were super interested in it. Procrastination and various other things. 

My PCP was a bit doubtful at the time, but it humored me any ways and I filled out a 4 page questionnaire that went back to childhood stuff, daily life, and questions my parents had to answer.  I think a lot of people think they have ADHD so they have an excuse to be lazy and underachieving. Same thing when people say, ""Oh my OCD is acting up. ""...very annoying. (I also stopped my anti depressants at the time because they weren't working and just made me crave sugary shit.)

Anyways he didn't even tally up my score because it was so high, lol! And was like ""Well seeing your answers, I'm fairly certain you're right. Let's give this medication a try. Call me in a week. Let me know how you feel. ""

Tried meds for a week, and literally, it was like putting my glasses on for the first time. My anxiety and depression were gone, I felt in control of my day, I could focus on work (I managed a gym at the time for my inlaws) my emotions finally felt regulated and my thoughts weren't bouncing around all day long.  

Even looking back on my childhood and early education, teachers often told my parents I was ""bright"" just lacked attention and needed more focus. When I spoke to my mom about this, she said she did take me to our PCP at the time when I was in elementary school because she knew something was wrong but couldn't figure it out. She ended up being dismissed by our PCP (they didn't recognize girls at the time could have ADHD)  which is also interesting because a teacher told my mom my brother had it and the doctor was dismissive of that to. (He's also been diagnosed recently)

I wish I had been diagnosed as a child. I took this all very hard for a while because I kept thinking, ""What could I have accomplished?""  It's all water under the bridge now, I think I've done well anyways I have an advanced diploma in health care and I'm in university now for health sciences....I really feel like the sky is the limit.  I'm 33 years now and would have liked to have completed my education before this age so I could enjoy my life more. 

I still struggle with self-esteem and confidence, though, and hard-core imposter syndrome, mostly due to the majority of teachers in elementary  and high school , getting frustrated with me and believing I was stupid. I had a teacher tell me I'd be scrubbing toilets the rest of my life at mc donalds.

 I had two teachers one in elementary school that told my parents I was gifted but couldn't bring it out in myself and an English teacher in higschool and pushed me into university level English and said I had no business being in lower level classes in high-school.  

You'll see a big difference if you stay on meds. It sounds like you're very successful now, I'm sure it'll only get better now with the appropriate diagnosis."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Studying/knowing about ADHD is not a requirement to become a psych (last I heard, anyway). It's an optional unit/course/thingy - so you do end up with a lot of licensed experts who've never studied the condition and thus end up believing what their peers say about it - peers who themselves may very well not have studied it either."
My psychologist apologised to me today,I did a grueling PhD program without meds and still hugely benefit from them. You can have adhd and be at the grad of your class if you figure out effective coping strategies.  It would have been nice if they knew this when I was a kid but better late than never.
My psychologist apologised to me today,"I’m so glad you got some validation and your psychologist apologized and took responsibility for her mistreatment of your presentation. It is a friendly reminder that bias is a controlling factor in our decisions. In school we are taught (I am ADHD and a psychologist) to do a controlled assessment before making any diagnosis. In your case she was probably making her decision based upon her relationship with you (which goes against everything we are taught) but it is so easy to do (jump to conclusions.) I think because I have ADHD and I am a psychologist I have an advantage of knowing that discrepancies in presentation and since most of my family members are as well and all present differently lots of comparisons to draw from. 

I look forward to ADHD being studied more and functioning levels be better defined-similarly to autism is starting to do."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Yea no shit. The amount of misinformation about ADHD even within health-care is astounding. I also have a University + Postgrad (but barely made it, last minute even with a B+ average)... To people who don't know me intimately, I might seem insanely smart, sharp, quick thinking and focused (but for me it's like climbing mount Everest each and every single day). I've gotten much better at it, I'm a Sherpa (but it aint easy and it's always dangerous).  


ANYTIME, anyone needs to learn about ADHD they need to be directed to this channel > https://www.youtube.com/@AdhdScience"
My psychologist apologised to me today,"I was officially diagnosed with ADHD earlier this year, after 38 years, while somehow simultaneously owning two full-time IT businesses and becoming extremely proficient at writing (poetry and blogs), sketching, mixing music (DJing), singing, fixing cars, wood working, spinning fire staff, and cooking. The only thing I wish I could do is remember to take my Adderall, and maintain a clean environment. Some atomic habits are harder to form than others, sadly. Adderall showed me I was living with chronic anxiety. ""What? So this is what it's like to live without 2 songs, 12 thoughts, and 5 images in your head at all times?""

I will say, I largely owe my talents to ADHD and the drive to become good at anything I'm interested in. Still, it would've been nice to not have chronic anxiety as a baseline for so many years and not realize it."
My psychologist apologised to me today,Keep him with you. Every person than can change their mind is pure gold these days.
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Even a pro has to see it to believe it sometimes. 

I’m glad you had one with a level head who was always willing to question even their own beliefs. It’s always nice to see when they adapt and learn, some fields of study are never going to stop evolving."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"We've seen our fair share of similar stories here and the high-functioning thing just kills me. When I was diagnosed 17 years ago by my therapist, she scored the assessment I had taken and her first comment was, ""You must be really smart to have done as well as you have."" There was no hesitation to test or then doubt the, apparently significant, results. It's sad that doctors are failing to see that the rise in cases is because of availability of information and not uptick in cases. Especially since it hasn't been that long since this happened with autism."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"""sudden rise in ADHD diagnoses""

That's why they should teach statistics better, and in every field.

There was a similar ""problem"" where some doctors noticed an unexplained rise in pregnancy related complications, nationwide. I don't remember the details so I might mix something up, but the general idea is the same.

Turns out, scientific advancements made it easier to detect ""failed"" pregnancy, that would previously be written off as a form of menstrual cycle disorders. Or something like this.

Statistics changed, because diagnosis methods improved.

There was no rise, the numbers got closer to the truth."
My psychologist apologised to me today,Just posting a hug 🤗
My psychologist apologised to me today,"There are multiple morals. 
Firstly,  you pursued it just in case. It turned out you were correct. 

Secondly, you psychologist apologized (Great modelling) with an explanation. 

Thirdly, you shared an important story with people whom it is important to know this. 

Fourthly, maybe someone is high functioning or knows of someone who is. There’s a good chance that you may positively influenced someone’s life for the better. 

Thank you for sharing. :-)"
My psychologist apologised to me today,"I am glad they had the humility to admit their mistake. Not many do, and much less so in today's world."
My psychologist apologised to me today,This is great news! I’d say the moral of the story is that it never hurts to get a second opinion. 😊
My psychologist apologised to me today,"When I asked my Doctor for a referral she pretty much said the same thing. Didn't care enough to know I had a degree but said I had a full time job and ""we all get like that sometimes especially when we have kids"". If you can pay taxes you're fine it seems."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"I just recently fired my psychiatrist for saying I **wasn't trying hard enough** to get the results I want. Medicaid covers the generic of adderall, but I didn't feel the same compared to the brand name that I used before I got on Medicaid. They didn't believe me! Neither did my PCP until they started asking their other ADHD patients how their medication was working for them... Frustrating that they can't read between the lines or take their patients seriously when they bring up their experiences 🙄

EDIT: Oh and for context I've been diagnosed with ADHD since my pre-teens (so, over a decade) and have been medicated since then... I may know what I'm talking about, DOC"
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Exactly. If we’re “high functioning” it’s in spite of our ADHD. I think back to school and remember how much of a mental struggle it was to get good grades. If I’d been diagnosed, I’d have gotten far better grades, with half the study time."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"I got diagnosed as a kid, my parents ignored because I had good grades.

I graduated med school (outside of the US) with distinction (like 93/100 on our evaluation scale) but at the cost of a lot of anxiety, depression and other comorbidities.

I was diagnosed again some months ago and started using medication and I truthfully regret not knowing this before, my mental health could be much better right now if I have managed this before, but as the old saying goes: ""The best moment to plant a tree was 20 years ago, the second best moment is today""."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"👍 Really glad that you lucked into a psychologist that's professional enough to recognize their mistakes, rethink their views, and correct their snap judgements.

I'm sure I'm not alone in being concerned/interested to see how the recent rise in ""Tick Tock ADHD"" self diagnoses' will impact outside views on ADHD. We're already heaving to deal with enough judgements like ""You're too high functioning"", ""You don't seem hyperactive right now"", etc. And even getting meds is now becoming a problem...

I was diagnosed basically immediately (around 4-5) and have dealt with it with varying degrees of success, with and without meds, for over 30 years. But even growing up with full knowledge of my condition, it's taken much of my thirties to finally recognize the full extent that ADHD has had on my professional and personal life. The obstacles it's put between me and my goals, the limits it's placed on my career. The relationships it's affected...

I hope that you are finally receiving the care and support that you need to become the person you know that you always could be!"
My psychologist apologised to me today,"great to hear!   
I was diagnosed in 2019 in Belgium at age 33 by a psychiatrist using QEEG/ERP. Diagnosis requires an initial referral by practioner for ADHD and min 1 therapy session with the diagnosing psychiatrist. 

My inattention index (TBR: theta/beta power ratio) peaked regularly at 400, which looked like a bottomless pitt in the middle of my brain on the top-down ERP map. 

After reading many stories here, its clear i was very lucky to have been diagnosed that easily."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"There is one thing I remember from this documentary about ADHD, “The Disruptors”.  I don’t know the exact quote but I remember it said this way.

If there was a sudden rise of detecting breast cancer in the population, we would celebrate that because we’re getting better at diagnosing and helping people. Why would ADHD be any different?"
My psychologist apologised to me today,"That’s wild!!! I think the sudden rise in diagnosis is due to how much awareness is out there now via social media. It can have a positive effect, but it seems to have brought on such a negative connotation. “Oh you have ADHD? Well who doesn’t these days?” 

I remember stumbling across an ADHD video on Instagram and was like uhhhh wtf this is me to a T?!? I looked further into, got tested and was diagnosed. No wonder work and school and relationships have always been a struggle. I would’ve never in my life thought me of all people had ADHD because I had only ever associated it with hyperactive uncontrollable school aged kids. 

Psychiatrists need to realize that sure, maybe we discovered it online but that doesn’t invalidate or negate the patients concerns or symptoms"
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Wow, great story and thanks for sharing!

Kudos to you for seeking a second opinion, and I’m so glad to hear it’s working out for you. Even though you’re already high-functioning, you will struggle less to maintain it and you will enjoy your life more with treatment. I’m sure you’re finding this already. 

Kudos to your psychologist for owning up to a mistake, in light of new evidence, and explaining why they made it in the first place.

Lots of us are relatively “high functioning” and successful even without a diagnosis and treatment; it’s absolutely NOT a diagnostic criteria, on its own, either way (someone who can’t get their shit together doesn’t automatically have ADHD either). We can learn to put systems in place and compensate for our dysfunctional brains to some extent, but it never ceases to be a struggle, and a lot of unnecessary trauma can come of that (both for ourselves and sometimes for those around us).

Also, even those of us with fairly severe symptoms can often stay on-task and get things done *if the consequences for failing are severe enough*. For instance, I spent 4 years in the military and was generally able to show up on time, keep my room clean, and otherwise do what was expected of me. It wasn’t *me* directing it, though, I just didn’t want to get my ass chewed! As soon as I got out into civilian life, my life was kind of a mess. Maybe you did well in college because you were too scared to fail. I hope not, but that can explain why some of us, especially if we have strict parents, manage good grades (I sure didn’t). In any case, it’s really no way to live. We all need to be able to set our own goals and standards for ourselves, and achieve them–not just do things out of fear."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Wow. Your therapist is not appropriately knowledgeable. I made good grades, mostly, and got good reviews at work, but I had really bad problems that screwed up my life in ways I could hide from people, for YEARS, and it only got worse with age. And that’s even after being on meds…had I not had to work full time, I may have been able to get therapy/coaching on how to function w/adhd as it presented itself in my life. 

Drugs are not enough. Unfortunately TIME is a major issue w/adhd… the lack of this precious resource as well as the management of it, work against you. I really believe trained coaches/ therapists would help, but that’s hard to fit into a work schedule or financial situation. 

But not ALL types of therapy would help. Your medical professionals need to be adequately up-to-date on adhd. Some of them don’t even believe it’s a thing and don’t know it impacts adults differently than children, or men differently than women, or that a woman can face extremely more severe symptoms after menopause. Some of them are as bad as uneducated people, thinking you are just making excuses. My psychiatrist was wonderful. She recognized I had it after numerous sessions with her, and was supportive, even worked with me on getting the right mix of meds, but she’s retired, then deceased, and the whole psych field is so different than her, now. She really cared about her patients quality of life. That concept is gone from the medical field now."
My psychologist apologised to me today,I feel this. I was diagnosed with Anxiety because „I didn’t seem like I have ADHD“. I still don’t know if I have it or not (waiting to get tested) but every more or less professional self test I did came out positive. My new therapist finally takes me seriously and we’re working on getting me a diagnosis.
My psychologist apologised to me today,One of the first things I did after meds was hang photos up on my wall! They give me so much joy
My psychologist apologised to me today,"My experience was similar, except *I* went in saying I thought I was depressed because I couldn’t get motivated. My doctor, who had known me for years, looked at me and said “do you think you might have ADHD?” And I said “…uh…I never really considered it?” And he said, “do some research and come back in a couple weeks.” 


When I came back, he said, “so?” And I said, “I think I have ADHD.” And he said “yeah, no kidding,” and prescribed me medication. Taking meds for the first time was like putting on glasses after not realizing your eyes were bad.


I had to switch doctors when my doctor stopped practicing, and luckily the new doctor hasn’t given me any grief about me being on meds. But it’s scary to think that if I need to switch doctors again, I’ll be looked at with suspicion and mistrust."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Everyone should have formal testing done, so that this cannot happen. But the real crime here is how financially inaccessible it is to many."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"I'm 47 years old and my doctor told me they don't treat ADHD in adults, because they find that the medication causes anxiety and so all they do is help with anxiety. I asked her how they help with anxiety and she suggested I try meditation. I almost went for her throat. Apparently if I'm not in school and not having trouble with a job they see no reason to treat ADHD in an adult. I would love to go back to school, since I fucked it up the first time around because of untreated ADHD. I have struggled at every job I've ever had and I'm currently unemployed because of untreated ADHD. But apparently because I'm not currently in school nor severely struggling at a job I don't deserve treatment. I keep telling myself I need to work at finding a new doctor who isn't such a (insert the most obscene insults you could come up with here) but I have ADHD and struggle with this whole executive dysfunction thing and trying to find a new doctor and risking going through this same thing all over again is just a lot so I sit and doom scroll Instagram instead. Aaargh."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"This is how the diagnosis should go. Take this pill and if you’re bounding off the walls, you don’t have ADHD. If you’re CALM and can finally sit down to read that book you’ve been wanting to read for 8 years, congratz you have ADHD."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"my doctor told me the only true ""test"" was to take medication and see how you reacted. I know that's not perfect, but giving folks at least a couple weeks to feel the difference would help a lot."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"I was recently diagnosed (but suspected for a number of years) as having the inattentive form of ADHD.  However, just before my first session, here in the UK a journalist did a very publicised report about getting told that he had ADHD by two of companies that do assessments (but not the one I had been referred to) - one of which has a contract with our health service - and then told that he did not have ADHD by a specialist in the health service.

I've seen a number of posts on the UK ADHD sub that people who already had been diagnosed and were being prescribed medication having their doctor refuse to prescribe it further until it had been reassessed because of that report..."
My psychologist apologised to me today,I just got diagnosed last week and it was my biggest concern that they would just say I didn't have it I knew I had it I did all of my own research I started about 2 years ago and hyper focused on it for hours on end every day the whole time I self diagnosed about a 9 months to year ago and with everything going on with psychiatrists and saying adhd is over diagnosed I was stressing because I have always struggled but it was normal to me and the imposter syndrome was hitting pretty heavy my gp actually convinced me to seek an official diagnosis and stated he thaught I would really benefit from adhd medications (I still haven't gotten any yet) I'm still waiting to see a psychologist about medication and what they think would work best for me but my partner is struggling to even get an initial appointment to discuss adhd or audhd it is a pretty in-depth assessment now to get diagnosed like if you don't have enough school records they basically don't want to diagnose you with anything but depression and or anxiety seems silly to me but I'm not a doctor
My psychologist apologised to me today,That happened to chronic pain patients? I’ve been complaining about chronic pain for 13 years and can’t even get a doctor to try to figure out what’s going on with my body none the less prescribe me something. I’ve been accused of being a drug addict more times than I can count and I’ve honestly completely lost hope that a doctor will care.
My psychologist apologised to me today,"It’s also frustrating because while I’m sure there really are people abusing these drugs…. It’s always been difficult to get them. And I don’t know what else stimulants like adderall are used for besides ADHD.  

It makes the comparison with pain medication all the more ironic. Like, yeah I’m sure regulations and practices have tightened up, but I think the opioid crisis is still a thing. And it’s a thing because it’s still commonly used for a multitude of situations, variants are available on the street, and there were/are doctors/pharmacists making extra (legally and illegally) from dealing it out.

I honestly think the skepticism comes less from a concern about abuse (I’m ignorant on the subject, but I doubt there’s anything of a widespread problem) and more from just the stigma of ADHD"
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Yeah brotha I have chronic pain (CRPS) and adhd and it has been a god damn struggle. Luckily I have an amazing pharmacy that knows me well and knows what I’ve been through so they don’t give me shit, but I’ve had so many other doctors that I’ve seen for my nerve damage tell me that I’m basically a druggie that is lying and that I don’t need any of my meds. I had my 9th surgery last fall and only got 800 mg ibuprofen for a new spinal cord stim"
My psychologist apologised to me today,I’m kind of glad I got diagnosed at 5 because it squashes all of that skepticism that I don’t have ADHD. I most certainly do and it’s debilitating
My psychologist apologised to me today,"I think too that some of those people who “abuse” the meds should just be on them but haven’t dealt with the emotional baggage of maybe having a mental disability, or just don’t know that how they normally feel is a disabled state. Way back in the day I took something similar to adhd meds in college and was like, “this makes my brain function too well. I must never take it again.” Well, yes, because I had adhd. But the only way I had to define the experience was that I had tried a drug, so it must just be doing drug things. If I had even known of the possibility of adhd literal decades of my life would have changed. 

Even later on someone close to me was diagnosed and was hinting that maybe I had it too. But, again, I didn’t know what adhd could feel like and how typical I was. It hit me like a plank to the head a few years after that. 

So maybe some of the recent spike in diagnoses is just people waking up from a long, depressing sleep. I hope the shortages can be resolved."
My psychologist apologised to me today,This video from Dr. Russell Barkley is *super* important: [Neuropsychological Testing is NOT Useful for the Diagnosis of ADHD](https://youtu.be/nVCDflvwkE8)
My psychologist apologised to me today,"I've been thinking this for a while now--there is absolutely over-prescribing happening and it's going to lead to crackdowns on everyone, including the ones that actually need ADHD meds. And then we'll have to deal with the resultant stigma just like chronic pain patients."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"In Germany in order to a get a diagnosis you need to visit 3 different doctors who all have to agree, since meth is a controlled substance. 

Honestly on one hand that makes sense, on the other hand making people who struggle with this stuff visit 3 doctors is torture."
My psychologist apologised to me today,Thats exactly how it went for me in high school
My psychologist apologised to me today,"I finally see someone about maybe getting diagnosed in two weeks.

Took me calling a bunch of places before I could get an appointment and the attitude most people I talked to had about it makes me apprehensive about how it will go. 

If only they could see how much caffiene I'm consuming. Meth would probably be seen as a healthier habit."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"I'm so nervous because I just asked my doctor to be tested and she said yes, but was still hesitant, and I was worried they wouldn't call me to set up an appointment and was just gonna brush it off like every other doctor, but I actually got a call yesterday!!!!!  I don't even necessarily want medication (I wouldn't say no, but I tried to stress to my doctor that I really just want a diagnosis), I just want to know that I'm not crazy and not a hypochondriac, and that my struggles are validated.  That would do loads for my mental health in itself."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"That's one way to do it, lmao :D Is it like that in the US only? I am in Switzerland and I have no problems to get my meds and so far I have not yet been treated like a junkie."
My psychologist apologised to me today,Well to be fair pain medication actually is overprescribed or rather prescribed wrong
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Well this is worse for the patients with ADHD tbh. Opioids are killing people in droves, so the fear against painkillers is at least rational. The ADHD med skepticism is just based on bullshit."
My psychologist apologised to me today,I was diagnosed at 7 but I have a history with opiate addiction now I get looked at like I am pill seeking. I don’t even like adderall but it helps me  tremendously. I am currently taking 80 mg of strattera and it’s not doing anything close to what 30xr adderall did for me.
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Yeah I was diagnosed over 20 years ago at the age of five. There was a whole test that took a couple of hours, I needed a parent to write what they noticed as well as an additional adult. I had to go through it again twice (once before high school and once before college) to get a 504 plan. I’m shocked people don’t have to do this anymore."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"(Edit: i was diagnosed last June, just over a year ago) 

I had to go through three medication “failures” of adhd treatment to get prescribed stimulants. Welbutrin, strattera, and something else I can’t even remember. Going on and off 3 different meds for months last summer fucked with my life soooo much!! Especially because I had to wait a few weeks for each one to build up and “start working” (which they didn’t), and then endure several dose increases with each one until I reached the max dose and still wasn’t seeing any benefits. Then, tapering off each one and starting the next. Meanwhile, my doc had also taken me off my lexapro because she thought that was what was making me so tired (spoiler: it wasn’t and my anxiety was THROUGH THE ROOF throughout this ordeal). I can only imagine what my brain chemistry was doing, being introduced to and maxed out on SNRI’s after being tapered off too quickly from a long term SSRI, and having other drugs introduced and taken away too. The whole summer was a brutal, fucked up rollercoaster for me (mentally/emotionally).

It sucks that they make us jump through so many hoops to get the medications we need. I also had to sign a contract (prohibiting me from taking any other drugs, even weed which is legal in my state) and do a blood and urine test to “prove” I wasn’t abusing my concerta script in the beginning in order to be able to take it long term. 

It’s a good thing I’m stubborn about advocating for myself when it comes to my mental and physical health, because damn. I could see how all that shit would make someone newly diagnosed just give up and try to cope on their own. The concerta, when I finally got it, offered SUCH a huge improvement I couldn’t believe it! Unfortunately, my energy levels and other symptoms are back. I just increased my concerta dosage, so I’m hoping that helps for a while. Idk what I’m gonna do if I have to switch meds when the concerta is at max dose and loses effectiveness. 🥲"
My psychologist apologised to me today,This is me. I've been diagnosed as having general anxiety and depression. The medication for this never helped me. I own my own business and there are so many things I should be doing to improve it but I can never make myself do it. Been reading about adhd and feel maybe this is what's going on. Don't know where to start though
My psychologist apologised to me today,"So I had a chat with a psychiatrist friend awhile back and asked exactly this and she said this is exactly what it is, especially in women. She said she is seeing many people like me who were written off as “chatty” or “daydreamers” as kids who are now being diagnosed as adults. It’s been chronically under diagnosed for as long as there’s been adhd."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"I remember a few years after I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety (20 years ago), suddenly everyone had it and people were sceptical then too. Now it's just the norm. Hopefully the same thing will happen with ADHD. In the meantime, I, as a 39 year old recently diagnosed person will continue to relate so much to the symptoms and others who have it, yet question if I'm just an imposter and if I was diagnosed correctly. Mostly because I'm still trying to find a med that works, so I'm doubting myself now. But I feel very confident ADHD has been as you said chronically undiagnosed. Especially in woman, or boys who present as inattentive rather than hyperactive (my husband is being tested later next month)."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Yep, and every misdiagnosis of adhd (not all that common, but surely happens) just furthers their belief that it's over diagnosed, too. Luckily I got diagnosed like 8 years ago, before too much of the social media push on it happened. It seems terrifying to seek diagnosis now, with so many just dismissed with grumblings about tiktok"
My psychologist apologised to me today,"*Especially* for inattentive and combined types! And in women, and even more so for minorities. It's awful that the medical profession can't get on the same page, everywhere, for everyone."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Yeah studies estimate about 10% of the population have it. That is a **lot** of people and the vast majority would be undiagnosed.

Add to that the sudden onset of the pandemic which fucked a lot of people's coping mechanisms/habits and it's easy to see why there's a huge flux of diagnoses.

I had personally been having suspicions about having it for years but had never prioritised it because I had ways to marginally cope with it. When the pandemic hit those strategies completely fell apart and it became very clear how completely inept I was attention and productivity wise compared to my peers, especially when left alone."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Not to mention, if there is such a mental health crisis that clearly is detrimental to such a huge portion of the population, mayyyybe its a sign that something isn't going right in our society? If EVERYONE is being diagnosed with depression or anxiety or ADHD, maybe its time to examine the more than just the individuals??"
My psychologist apologised to me today,"I'm actually pretty certain that I not only have ADD but autism. 

I track with a lot of the other characteristics of autism too ...

I always thought those with autism were more severe in their functional deficits but since it's a spectrum you can be very highly functioning and not have all of the classic symptoms.

I'm working with my doc now to see if I can get an official diagnosis"
My psychologist apologised to me today,"As a young “gifted” kid, I did well in school because I didn’t have to try. Anything that required effort? I got a lower grade - the “unacceptable” B instead of an A or whatever. I NEVER took naps as a kid and later spent most of grade school distracting other students. Distracting others has always been my specialty lol. As an adult I became more aware of distracting others. It turned into other issues instead…"
My psychologist apologised to me today,"I didn't start to realize that I could have ADHD until I was in college. In high school, all of my classes that I actually enjoyed were too easy, so it didn't really make a huge difference if I was paying close attention or not. 

In college, when I had to monitor my own behavior more, it was much harder for me to keep up. I had no study skills (because I didn't need them in high school), no time management, and a lack of focus.

It was recalling my behaviors in non-academic settings through childhood that got me to my diagnosis. I didn't get medicated for it until I was 23 and was on very wrong dosages for quite a while, but neither psychiatrist I've seen has doubted that I have ADHD when presented with the evidence."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Yep, that's totally how I'd describe me. I'm doing fine financially and with my career now, but it was a very unpleasant journey to get here fuelled by high levels of stress, worry and procrastination.

I actually had all the signs of childhood ADHD lol, was always stimming in class and getting in trouble for distracting others. I also had grades which while were fine, were far below my full potential (once I went to university and was studying things I actually found interesting, I was getting A's compared to C's and B's in school). Kinda disappointed in my parents and teachers for never thinking to take me to a doctor about my behaviour, but I think everyone here wishes they were diagnosed earlier."
My psychologist apologised to me today,The most meta edit
My psychologist apologised to me today,Not OP but a high functioning friend who is currently burnt out told me the secret is anxiety.
My psychologist apologised to me today,"If you're low on dopamine, use adrenaline.

(not suggested by 99 out of 100 doctors)"
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Anxiety and pressure are the only thing that gets me moving sometimes, outside of interest. 

I need to be:


 scared as fuck of being a failure


Know that I have no choice but to act now


Or to at least have a genuine interest in what I'm doing, and often that isn't even enough to get me to enjoy myself after a day.


As a result I have a career I love, but God damn if it isn't hard to do anything to improve myself beyond that. I come home as a vegetable most days. Look at the mess around me. See no way to change it. And if there isn't anything readily available I go to bed without eating."
My psychologist apologised to me today,I feel like If i was just a head in a jar I would be happier
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Keep trying, get a second opinion. First psychiatrist told me I didn't have it because I had a university degree and wasn't currently presenting as hyper. Like...my dude...I'm coming to see you because I'm at the end of my rope and feeling severely depressed about it, of course I'm not hyper right now...as for the rest...well, turns out this dude was just a useless ass hat with antiquated views on ADHD. A full 10 hour assessment later and I got a diagnosis from a different professional."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Yeah they're competent and understand things like high functioning anxiety and depression, but they had misconceptions about how ADHD manifests and can impact people's lives.

From our conversations it sounded like all ADHD clients they worked with in the past struggled with basic things like just holding a job. They didn't realise that ADHD does way more than limit your potential - it also often leads to a range of psychological problems like anxiety. They also didn't realise how the 'obvious' signs of ADHD could be masked by things like intelligence."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"I feel like the link between ADHD and anxiety is not appreciated by medical professionals.  Since my 20s (now in my 40s) I told my same PCP that I think I have ADHD and described the constant cycle of extreme procrastination, followed by the realization that a due date was looming, immediately followed by the dread of thinking this is the time that I waited too long and thinking through the consequences of failure, leading to a panic attack that more than once landed me in her office sobbing.  I tried to explain that I am not constantly anxious and that I don't ruminate or constantly feel anxious.  I only arrive to the point of panic attack after realizing 1- I made a careless mistake and I am thinking through the consequences or 2- I think I procrastinated too much and I am thinking about the consequences.  She told me that may well be that I have ADHD but we treat the anxiety because ADHD medication is addictive side effects.  Yet I have had scripts for Ativan, Xanax, and Clonapin for acute anxiety - all addictive substances with potentially harmful side effects.  Plus, the health effects of having anxiety be your life's driving force?  I just don't see how that is better than treating the underlying condition."
My psychologist apologised to me today,I'm also building a buffer of medication. Where I am psychiatrists are extremely in demand and your PCP can't prescribe stimulants. Worried that in 6 months there's gonna be a huge wait to get my prescription renewed.
My psychologist apologised to me today,This is amazing! I'm laughing with joy that you full on schooled your Dr. Well done!
My psychologist apologised to me today,Primary care physician
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Oh yes, the "" perfectionist "" call. I really dont think that is the case for many of us. It is something else and exhibits as perfectionism, imo.  Sure it may apply sometimes, but i go into confusion mode when i hear this word, applied to me."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"psychiatrists are not psychologists

and I'm seriously fffing miffed at how much _life_ time is wasted where _psychiatrists misdiagnose and prescribe antipsychotics_ when what was needed was an ADHD prescription.

>So many people are more interested in retaining the illusion of being experts than actually helping others.

**This is so very true!!**"
My psychologist apologised to me today,">My psychologist who I've been seeing for a few years

>A few sessions with my psychologist later

This professional has been in their life for _several years_. Then after seeing them over _a few sessions_ whilst medicated was able to see a remarkable (comment worthy) difference. That is not a rash or flippant decision. They didn't just spend an hour with them before and an hour after, checking some boxes and scoring them.

""but all it took"" seriously undermines what great care seems to have been displayed here."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"I have ADHD and anxiety. Anxiety meds did nothing for me and I just kind of accepted that medication couldn’t help it. Then I started ADHD meds and was amazed at how effective it was at reducing my physical anxiety. It’s actually making way more of a difference for my anxiety than my ADHD symptoms. I think a lot of what I attributed to anxiety is actually my ADHD (ie constantly being in a tense stressed state) as well as being a way to compensate for my ADHD (ie constantly worrying about what I’m forgetting, worrying I’ll say the wrong thing in social situations, that sort of thing)

So if you have ADHD symptoms and anxiety I feel like that’s reason enough to try meds."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"I’ve heard that many people with adhd get diagnosed with anxiety first and medicated for that. But if they’re medicated for adhd first, a lot of the anxiety is taken care of."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"I’ve had a severe anxiety diagnosis for the better part of 15 years, and it got to the point that I couldn’t work, and all of my energy went to making sure my kid was safe. I couldn’t care for myself, I was missing psych meds for other things. My doctor was in the process of signing off on disability. 

My psychiatrist suggested I may have ADHD last year when I first started seeing her, but I couldn’t afford testing. I was finally able to get the test and it was like “duh, she’s both inattentive and hyperactive.” 

I’ve been Adderal for a month and my life is completely changed. I’m pulling my weight in the household, taking care of myself, I’m a better parent. 

And my anxiety? I’ve had 3 panic attacks this month. I was having 3-4 a DAY!!!"
My psychologist apologised to me today,"I was diagnosed with depression long before ADHD. When I was finally able to put all my symptoms together and get my ADHD diagnosed, I realized I was depressed because I was constantly living in an unorganized mess of house. I could never come home to relax because I would come home to a disaster and would then be completely overwhelmed and not know where to start so I wouldn't start anything and it just compounds."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"I remember the first psychologist I met with, when I was completely overwhelmed in undergrad. At the time, the thought of ADHD never crossed my mind -- I just didn't really know about it. But I remember talking about how I couldn't pay attention or take notes in classes, how I struggled get myself to sit down and do homework, how I get frazzled and constantly lose things, how it's been like this since childhood, and all the other totally classic symptoms of ADHD which should be *completely obvious* to a trained psychologist.

And what I got back was pretty much ""Oh, everyone is like that. It's just impostor syndrome, you just need to work on your self-confidence and trying to judge yourself objectively"". I remember feeling just so lost and frustrated."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety in high school, and ADHD in college. When I finally treated my ADHD in college, it basically cured my depression and anxiety. 

So many doctors are so skeptical of ADHD in people that have psychiatric disorders, assuming the executive dysfunction is a side effect of that, when in reality, my anxiety and depression were actually side effects of the untreated ADHD."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"I'm late but ADHD and anxiety have 75% comorbidity. Having anxiety, if anything, makes you more likely to have ADHD."
My psychologist apologised to me today,I am always so impressed with other people who have that kind of thing up!
My psychologist apologised to me today,"This was my experience with therapy! I went in saying I felt like a worthless wife and mom because <insert symptoms here > and the therapists goes: ""Have you ever been diagnosed with adhd?"""
My psychologist apologised to me today,"AND nobody deserves to be too poor to afford said testing.

Always gotta be careful with folks who see economic inequality as a feature and not a bug."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"There are treatment options beyond stimulants, if the doctor is trying to avoid anxiety."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Even though I'd been pretty sure I'd had ADHD as a kid, I had started to believe that since I thought I'd had it for so long, I gaslit myself and gaslit a doctor and it took me a week to even take one of the pills out of fear that I'd manipulated the system.

Knocked out for an hour and when I woke up I realized I hadn't gaslit anyone - I had just been right all this time."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Just FYI, You'll need to see a psychiatrist for any medications, as psychologists cannot write prescriptions."
My psychologist apologised to me today,Will your gp prescribe something for you?
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Pretty much, the opioid epidemic kicked off with doctors prescribing too liberally (among other things), and now they've done a 180 and are super strict with prescribing to the point that people actually suffering from chronic pain have a hard time getting treatment."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"There is no ""going to lead to,"" we're already treated like drug seekers regularly."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"My GP can only prescribe me 3 months of meds, and I can only fill them once a month. So every month I have to get in to the pharmacy before I run out, and every 3 months schedule an appointment to ask for more medication.   

I really need a higher dose/different med, but am afraid to ask because I already get a feeling she doesn't like to prescribe it, and I don't want to risk losing access to the meds. (I was dx'd by a previous GP who retired)"
My psychologist apologised to me today,"That is so not true. There is no standardized procedure so the approaches for the diagnosis will differ between doctors. But in most cases you only need to see one and they will run some questionnaires and maybe look at some certificates from school or other childhood documents. Maybe you had bad experiences, there are a lot of unprofessional doctors. But please don't discourage other people seeking help."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Kids still do. 

But it’s a very different dynamic with adults, you can’t just have your boss fill out the teacher forms."
My psychologist apologised to me today,I used the TikTok thing to my advantage sort of. I told my therapist that I was seeing lots of stuff about adhd on TikTok and felt like I fit a lot of the criteria. We chatted about it off and on over the course of a few appointments and she recommended I talk to my family doctor about it. So by the time I spoke with him I was genuinely able to say “my therapist recommended that I talk to you about adhd” and didn’t even have to mention the TikTok thing. He did the screening right then and there and was shocked I was able to function so long without medication. My first time taking concerta I cried because it was like someone closed all the tabs in my brain allowing me to focus on what I wanted to do instead of the constant background chatter. I consider myself extremely fortunate to have the family doctor that I have because I know many will try to refer out immediately and don’t want to touch adhd (or anything psychiatric outside of mild depression/anxiety).
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Yes! I was only recently diagnosed myself, and my entire academic life since a kid suffered severely for it. Sucks"
My psychologist apologised to me today,sad no one has responded to this but i completely agree
My psychologist apologised to me today,Examine genetics?
My psychologist apologised to me today,[deleted]
My psychologist apologised to me today,">As a young “gifted” kid, I did well in school because I didn’t have to try. Anything that required effort? I got a lower grade - the “unacceptable” B instead of an A or whatever.

Same!"
My psychologist apologised to me today,"oh that's me. excelled in all grades including college but didn't leverage that into anything because i never had to try and never really cared, just was afloat on the fear of staying poor forever. and at my happiest and social best, i am even more so the most distracting coworker and have noticed i always demotivate my coworkers from work in favor of fun and/or fascinating conversations/storytelling. i was born to disrupt labor. lol"
My psychologist apologised to me today,"This happened to me too. I found being in college and managing my own time/study difficult. 

I managed to get through it by creating ""rules"" that I did not even know I was following (attending every class - because I know if I do something once [i.e., cutting class], I'll do it again - and reading everything on the syllabus, for example). But I did suffer from huge issues with time management and massive amounts of anxiety. 

It was more than a decade later that I began to think that I might have ADHD. 

Apart from a few ""standard"" traits (fast-paced talking, for example), I just don't immediately present as a typical case."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"this is exactly me. got diagnosed a week ago (20yo). Ive been struggling in college, while every form of education before that was extremely easy. I mostly struggle with the big assignments where you have to plan everything out by yourself. I still have little to no trouble passing exams though.
I hope meds can help me as much as I see them help people on here. going see what works for me this fall. :)"
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Can confirm

Source: me. 40 yr old married mom of 3 who's always held down a job. It took me 5 months to work myself up to make an important phone call"
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Yep, pretty much. Getting my degree was a blur of constant stress and sleep depravation. The only reason I did ok was because it was a topic I was always very interested in, so most subjects were stimulating enough that I was able to get stuff done. Still wish I was medicated then though, my life would have felt so much easier and enjoyable."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Anxiety, perfectionism and burnout! Also for me undiagnosed Autism as well"
My psychologist apologised to me today,That makes a lot of sense
My psychologist apologised to me today,It's definitely my case 🙋‍♀️
My psychologist apologised to me today,Painfully accurate.
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Also, if you look at more than just the high functioning part, you'll find much is a huge mess and/or a partner who makes up for your deficits."
My psychologist apologised to me today,“I find I do my best work when experiencing overwhelming terror.”
My psychologist apologised to me today,It’s fine if there’s 1 doctor that says it’s okay right?
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Your last paragraph hits hard. I have what most consider to be a high-functioning career and while I love what I do, it pretty much takes all of my spoons everyday. It's so frustrating to come home to a cluttered house and not have the motivation to do anything about it."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Thank you! I also have Xanax, Lunesta, etc (prescribed by my PCP of 12 yrs) because my anxiety brain never shuts off.

Then i started down the ADHD treatment path, and after a yr and a half of ineffective quanfacine therapy, I asked my (former) psychiatrist about stimulants and got a 20 min lecture about how I don't need them, and to try Welbutrin (even though I had about a decade ago and had a seizure at work, so, hard pass) and that she wouldn't be doing that for me.

A year later, I'm sobbing in my PCPs office about it, and she's like, ""Honey, which one, and how much do you want? You deserve to feel better"" and starts typing up the prescription I didn't even realize she could handle.

God, I love that woman"
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Thank you! I hope to inspire others to take their docs to task, I figure it can only help future patients when we force them to do better. I was also bigtime pissed that he was effectively trying to use my other issues to withhold treatment, under the guise of being sensitive or understanding. He went to med school with my next PCP, who was the best doctor I’ve ever met, she wasn’t surprised to hear he wasn’t the best. 🤷‍♀️"
My psychologist apologised to me today,"is a dissociative anesthetic mainly used recreationally for its significant mind-altering effects. PCP may cause hallucinations, distorted perceptions of sounds, and violent behavior.


seems legit 🤣


pcp = [angel dust](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phencyclidine)"
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Then again i went through a couple of stages in apperance that probably looked like like robinson crusoe after a heavy night out.  Probably perfectioonism , lol :)"
My psychologist apologised to me today,"I've been on meds for ADHD all my life. I understand the struggle.  
However, anyone can show up to their psychologist with new medications all ""feel"" different, doesn't mean that one have a trouble if meds are working.  
I mean, it is my takeaway from the story, but I am super happy for OP if his therapist change his mind.  
We are all on the same team."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Same here, medication has helped my anxiety so much. I think a lot of this is because when medicated my brain doesn't try to overthink everything like a game of 4D chess.

The first week I took my meds it legitimately felt like I was high, I just felt so much more chill than normal."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"In my case, I developed anxiety as a coping/masking mechanism for my ADHD prior to diagnosis. 

After medication, I have a healthy level of anxiety and am waaay less uptight and rigid. It's wild."
My psychologist apologised to me today,I actually feel exactly the same. Being anxious about everything and that stuff. I didn’t know that this could be ADHD until just a few weeks ago and this would explain so much for me. I’m a bit too anxious to go to the doctor for this so I’m just waiting for my therapist and myself to get me a real test. I don’t know if I could even get meds in Germany without an official diagnosis.
My psychologist apologised to me today,"I feel this way so much…. Thought I had adhd but after talking to a psychologist she said what I was experiencing (forgetting appointments even if they were expensive no show fees, being late a lot) were “minor irritations”….and it was more anxiety and depression that anything else. I accepted that but then I see these posts and I’m like gosh this is confusing to me. Brother has adhd and I have to say my symptoms are nowhere close to his in severity but I still feel frustrated wondering if I’m taking the right meds."
My psychologist apologised to me today,Did you have panic attacks?
My psychologist apologised to me today,I’m currently only medicated for depression which let the anxious part show much more. I’m really looking forward to get tested to finally get some clarity and feel like a normal human being.
My psychologist apologised to me today,Makes sense. I went on anti depressants in hs and they made me crazy. Really thinking most of my anxiety and depression could be adhd and solved by adhd meds
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Yeah, I’ve heard repeatedly from many sources (including my prior counselor) that anxiety and depression are common co-morbidities with ADHD (& probably with most other mental health issues). It makes it really frustrating to hear stories of people who were denied even an investigation because “well, it could be anxiety or depression.” 

Like, I get that stimulants are nothing to take lightly and that they don’t work for all ADHD people…but for those whom it does work, it’s pretty quick. Thinking of my own experience, as well as a comment above, here’s what I think would work for most: interview us about our life and interests, note various ticks or patterns (leg shaking, non-linear thought process, etc), and then give us 10mg of something and see what happens (not a medical professional in any way and…mostly joking)"
My psychologist apologised to me today,Why does treating ADHD reduce anxiety so much? Is it because you are doing the things you’re supposed to do so the baseline anxiety goes down?
My psychologist apologised to me today,Amazing! I’m so happy for you.
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Yes, this!!!"
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Just had a mini revelation reading your comment. It does get me down seeing clutter, and affects my mood a lot now I think about it."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"This is super similar to what I went through. I was probably 20, it was the first psychologist I’d ever been to but I had had a therapist for probably 3 years prior to that. This psychologist though, listened to me tell him all about all my symptoms that extended back to middle school and were textbook inattentive adhd. He scheduled me for a test and I was really excited to finally have some answers. This test was to watch a screen and click a mouse every time a dot flashed in a screen. Bc I was so excited, I “aced” this test🤦‍♀️. He was just like “welp guess you don’t have adhd🤷🏼‍♀️”. I was diagnosed 6 year later finally without a stupid computer test!"
My psychologist apologised to me today,My depression and part of the anxiety origin from bullying that I’ve experienced from age 7-16. I don’t blame doctors not thinking of ADHD. I only can focus on that one because I’ve managed to let the past behind me and move on.
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Me too. I had a album in my phone and a physical box of photos that I’d collected over the years “for the wall”. I’d spent money on frames. All lay untouched. I couldn’t ever complete the task. Too many options. I also didn’t make it easy because wanted a gallery wall.  

After meds I started organising it all, ended up spray painting the frames because they no longer matched the decor! 

So many compliments from friends & hubby loves them. I’ve been told they’re very well curated. The photos themselves bring me joy, but honestly every time I look at them I get such a buzz just because I finally completed the task!!"
My psychologist apologised to me today,My doctor straight up thinks ADHD is not something that needs to be treated in adults. Apparently we grow out of it as soon as we turn 18.
My psychologist apologised to me today,Yeah I know that I am waiting for a psychiatrist appointment to even be available so I can discuss medication but there are none around me for a fairly long time
My psychologist apologised to me today,Maybe I'm not sure he dose think i should have medication so hopefully haha
My psychologist apologised to me today,Maybe I'm not sure he dose think i should have medication so hopefully haha
My psychologist apologised to me today,"That epidemic sucks for everyone honestly. Like I’ve even told doctors I’d happily settle for any painkiller that wouldn’t have severe risks to their license or have risk of addiction and still got a no. I’d even take “here’s ibuprofen, leave”"
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Same. I made it through hs because I had structure but I still had F's and D's in the subjects I wasn't interested in or good at right away. Then college came and wow, zero study or time management skills."
My psychologist apologised to me today,I was thinking more along the lines of: “Examine capitalism (and it’s detrimental effect on the working class.)”
My psychologist apologised to me today,">But it wasn't until years later, in college, that I found out that I had never learned to study and didn't even know what it was. 

Oh my gosh, this is me. Did great all through grade school, high school, my lowest grade was a B in geometry. I had 110 in Chem II (because our class had a super bimodal distribution and our teacher had to teach to the lower ""hump"" instead of the high end). Then I got into college and didn't know how to study. Got my first C and was almost dropped from honors classes."
My psychologist apologised to me today,In my case at least
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Well, sometimes. I’m definitely lucky enough to have a partner that will help me with my impossible tasks. But my friend just had her shit together, to the point that I asked her about it the day before my previous comment lol. Stress hormones are a hell of a drug."
My psychologist apologised to me today,Turns out malpractice claims are a terrific motivator!  *whimpers*
My psychologist apologised to me today,"I am taking Wellbutrin and it helps me but I absolutely cannot drink when I am on it.   I also have done years of CBT and have developed a lot of strategies to circumvent my ADHD tendencies, so I don't feel an immediate urge to seek out a script for stimulants for myself.  Thankfully, I got both my kids in for full evaluations early in their lives so they get the help they need and hopefully they will never have to go through what I did."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Unfortunately there are a lot of doctors like this (and honestly I've found *most* of them to be male). My female doc I had for about 8 years was AMAZING. My current male doctor seems ok, but I've only met with him 3 times so far. Hopefully it goes well. People definitely know when something isn't right with them, more than doctors do. I mean, we kind of live with ourselves 24/7, we know when something is off or if a diagnosis just doesn't feel right."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"I called my Dr first week on meds confused because the Adderall seemes to be making me sleepy. Turns out years of running in adhd overdrive had justcompletely exhuasted me, and I was just experiencing relaxation and the ability to truly rest for the first time. 

I could just sit in a chair petting my cat and listen to the rain and drift off. That wasn't ""drowsiness as a side effect"" that was a normal human experience."
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Since I was diagnosed late last year, I've only once been able to find one full 30-day supply.  I really want the help from meds, but if I can't get it then I'm just kind of f\*cked.

I wasn't even on a dose that was high enough to make a big difference, but I DID feel a difference with it.  Some people think I shouldn't have access to this type of medication because so many younger people need it.

But I'm still a real, live person.  I've made it through my life this long without the help of the right kind of medication, and if I can die having known finally what it's like to be fully medicated for my ADHD that will be a huge blessing.

I hope I can outlive this medication shortage!

EDIT: Clarity"
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Same! I even went off my SSRI after being on Adderall for a couple months, and have been feeling so great ever since!"
My psychologist apologised to me today,Nope
My psychologist apologised to me today,Good luck! I hope it all works out for you!
My psychologist apologised to me today,"It’s basically like your brain is suffocating without dopamine, and then it causes your brain to recognize something isn’t normal, then it panics. And you don’t have the “I have to get everything done and I can’t move” panic"
My psychologist apologised to me today,"That sucks, I'm sorry you have to wait so long. Hope things happen sooner than expected for you!"
My psychologist apologised to me today,Couldn't hurt to ask! I just wondered because my GP is who prescribes my meds for me!
My psychologist apologised to me today,Same
My psychologist apologised to me today,I’m about to start going off my SSRI which I never felt did anything but kept taking anyway in case. I’m a little nervous about it but also a little excited since I think it might be part of why I’m so tired all the time.
My psychologist apologised to me today,Thanks so much ❤️
My psychologist apologised to me today,“Suffocating without dopamine” is a great way of describing the ADHD and anxiety relationship.
My psychologist apologised to me today,Well I will definitely bring it up I have an appointment with my gp tomorrow to discuss my diagnosis report
My psychologist apologised to me today,"Good luck!! The tiredness was part of why I went off my SSRI also, and for me, it was a huge help. I hope you find tons of energy! :)"

Dexedrine spansules,Trying it with one would probably provide you with the most accurate answer 🤷‍♂️
Dexedrine spansules,"Yes, crushing Dexedrine Spansules would destroy the slow-release mechanism, leading to rapid absorption of the dextroamphetamine. This would effectively convert it into an immediate-release (IR) form.

Dexedrine Spansules are designed with a special coating that allows for the gradual release of the medication throughout the day. When you crush the capsule or its contents, you disrupt that coating, causing the full dose of dextroamphetamine to be released all at once rather than slowly over several hours."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Her reaction was totally over the top, holy shit. I’m so sorry that happened. Can you start looking for a new doctor ASAP? I know it’s hard to find psych providers lately but you shouldn’t have to deal with this lady. You asked a reasonable medical question and did NOT deserve that kind of hostility. Ugh."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Report her and seek alternative council. 
No professional should act like that to their charges."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"As I started reading this, I was thinking about how they might have phrased things and whether you might be misinterpreting. Then I read your quote from her.

 Your psychiatrist is *fucking insane*. I don't know how to word this properly to give you the proper perspective of what you just wrote.

If what you wrote is actually what she said, it's beyond the pale. It is *well* beyond just being a crappy therapist. This is literally to the level of an elementary school teacher describing her sex life to her class or a dog trainer who kicks the dogs. This is not someone bad at their job, this is someone actively doing harm. 


She is explicitly calling your feelings invalid, making you feel like a burden and not a patient, questioning your authenticity, complaining about other patients to you, putting you down, and showing a total lack of understanding what the hell ADHD even is. Just to start. A professional who's even at the most basic level of competence would not be doing any of those things.

I seriously cannot stress enough how far off base this person was vs what you should be expecting from their profession. I'm so sorry you've had to go through it. Psychiatrist should not be like that, at all. Honestly you may even want to consider reporting her."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Specializes in ADHD my ass. Can you get a new prescriber? Her reaction is really terrible. I’m so sorry. I agree,  I’d report her, insinuating correct dosage is ‘addict behavior’ and that invalidating your experience by saying it’s ‘nice to have’. *shakes her head*"
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"YIKES.  She said the quiet part out loud (I don't want to lose my license > more important than actually doing right by my patients).  She literally called you abnormal?  That sounds like a reportable offense, especially for a so-called psych doctor.  

She has every right to prescribe the dose she thinks is right, but NOT to insult you or claim you don't actually need your medication.  Time to find another doctor but not before filing some kind of complaint.  That kind of abuse is seriously not okay.  However long it takes, I'd make a point to turn her in to the board and/or write as many negative (honest) reviews as you can.  That's not okay."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"She deserves to lose her license, but not for the reason she's afraid of."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Report her. 8 years of medication without any complications or issues shouldn't prompt her to react like that. Unless she didn't receive any medical records from your previous treatment/provider she is allowed to refuse but not be THAT obnoxious. Someone mentioned that it's a damn violation of disability act as well. Even a pharmacist is not allowed to talk like that let alone is psychiatrist.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Oh, she can fuck right off! If she specializes in adhd as she claims, she would know that at least a dozen of the things she said are nearly universal triggers specifically to adhd. It's almost like each word was carefully crafted to do the most psychological damage as possible, like Truman and his advvisors discussing which cities to nuke. She openly stated that she is worried she will lose her license. Good. I hope she does."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Tbh sounds like her other patients don’t actually need their scripts so of course they don’t advocate for themselves or complain because they will take anything. I’d find a new doc if you can. She is wildly unprofessional with that projection.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,That sounds pretty unprofessional
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,I keep reading about people's bad experiences like this. Is there some kind of organization or outlet people can use to complain about these things? She so worried about losing her license for the wrong reason. That's just so unacceptable there should be some kind of repercussions for treating patients that way.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,">""This isn't a medication you 'NEED', it's a 'nice to have', so just make do with what you get""

This is not at all appropriate, or professional. She needs to be reported. 

I'm also wondering, is this an MD/DO? They of all people ought to know better."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"I hope to god you had that recorded somehow and plan on contacting the state/county board over absolutely unacceptable behavior. She shouldn't be lashing out at you period end of story. If she's a psych and not just a therapist, then she could lose her license over these accusations. She could just as easily discontinue the medication of these ""patients"" who harass pharmacists over their medication and request that they seek treatment elsewhere if it's just a ""nice to have."" (bitch being on adderall is the first time my brain has worked normally since i was like 8 years old and even then I was a social outcast who was too weird for social interaction!) 

these people need to be rooted out so that others do not have to put up with their irrational behavior. She seems like someone who's losing control and lashing out at patients is the worst way she could handle this. 

Read up on the [APA ethics primer](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/Ethics/principles-medical-ethics.pdf). She is probably violating several guidelines at once in this single interaction alone. Contact her license board. If she's so afraid of losing her license, then maybe she's doing something actually shady and shifting blame to people who don't get their Rx on time. (MY PCP is terrible about this! I had to wait nearly a week because they just *didn't send the fucking script)*"
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"I had a similar experience, not sure where you found this psychiatrist but I requested a change of psych in network through my care provider, told them my psychiatrist was ignoring my needs and questions and they obliged. Unfortunately took about a month to get an appointment with a new one but so worth it."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"First and foremost, request that your previous psychiatrist provide a handoff summary to any new prescriber you see. Having a good handoff will ensure that your 8 years of history with a specific medication dosing is understand as reasonable.

Secondly, unless she is independent, file a complaint with her company. Then file a complaint against her license with the Board of Medicine in your state. Bonus Fun fact, if you file a yelp/ google review, she can't dispute your assertions or she risks violating HIPAA.

Don't use emotionally charged language in the complaint. State facts. What can't you do when your ADHD is unmanaged? When/ what time did the incident occur? Use direct quotes when possible. Were I you, I'd write my complaint to look something like this:

""I had an appointment with Schmuckatelli MD on 6/17/2022 to revisit my transition of care with her as I didn't believe she had consulted with my previous mental health physician regarding my prescription for dexedrine IR. Per my previous physician's notes it was well established that at baseline I use 40-60mg/ day to manage my symptoms; Schmuckatelli MD only prescribed me 30mg Dexedrine IR daily. 

When I attempted to express my concerns with Schmuckatelli she was immediately hostile to my request and and accused me of being ""needy"" and compared me to an addict. She also stated that the medications I use to manage my ADHD were not a ""need"", but just ""nice to have"". In this same appointment Schmuckatelli informed me that she was worried about her license and insinuated that her license is more important than managing her patient's mental disorders. 

Based off of my interaction with Schmuckatelli I do not believe this physician is adhering current evidence based practices regarding managing psychotropic medications. My livelihood and quality of life is dependent on me being able to function. I don't even feel safe driving without the benefit of my ADHD medications. I can't believe I was treated so callously by a psychiatrist who advertises that she specializes in working with adult ADHD patients.

Please advise me if I can clarify my complaint, and please notify me of the complaint's progress.

Respectfully,

Exclufi"
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"You would think they would start at the place the last psychiatrist left off...

Right, so I need to have crippling depression and anxiety?"
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,That's incredibly unprofessional and you should file a complaint.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"First of all, drop this doctor like the hot garbage that she is. What the hell? ADHD is a medical condition because we don't have the chemicals made by our body that our brain needs to function properly. It is no different than a diabetic needing insulin but because it is considered a mental health condition, some people, including doctors, act like we can click our heels 3 times and the chemicals our brain needs will magically manifest themselves and we can function. We had a similar issue with my husband getting his meds and I was told if they couldn't verify that he wasn't working or in school full time, they would not prescribe ADHD meds. He is medically retired military but he still needs to function! We were considering using an out of network doctor that was adult ADHD friendly, paying for it ourselves and then submitting a claim to his insurance for at least partial reimbursement. Thankfully, we found out the VA doctors will prescribe ADHD meds (we had no clue they would) so he went that route. If I were you, I would schedule a phone call with the new doctor for a consultation prior to an appointment to make sure their practice philosophy matches up with what your needs are and then ask them if they have any restrictions on prescribing ADHD meds to adults when clinically indicated and if they are only willing to prescribe a maximum dosage even if it is not delivering any therapeutic benefits because you need a higher dose. I would also ask if they agree with the DSM-5 definition of ADHD (some doctors surprisingly don't). If not, don't waste anymore time with that doctor. [DSM criteria ADHD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519712/table/ch3.t3/)"
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"I think the treatment of people taking ADHD meds is beyond absurd. I live in a state where I cannot get my daughter's prescription of 30 days filled less than 30 days from the last one. So I have to call the day she takes the last one and hope the dr is in to authorize another 30 days. Can't send an extra one to school in case we miss a dose in the morning, because then we won't have enough to get through if we *don't* miss a dose. Because you know we get that methylphenidate just to use it for fun!! Seems logical for an 11 yr old with inattentive ADHD /s SMH.  No one should have to be berated or jump through hoops for medications that they need."

Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Jesus…she sounds psycho and incredibly unhinged. That’s so unprofessional! She shouldn’t be meddling with your dose, she should just continue what was working and what your last provider was doing. There was no reason to change your dose. 

My doctor literally asks me at every appointment of my dose is still working and if I want more. She has told me to call her any time if my job or school gets more stressful and I need a higher dose. I’ve never requested one, because what I’m on works great for me, except for one time. I told her I felt like my meds didn’t work during my period, turns out that’s a common problem and she gave me immediate release tablets to go with my extended release during that time. I wasn’t even planning to ask for more medication, she just gave it to me because she understands ADHD and wanted to make sure I was getting adequate treatment.

I’ve never once had a problem with the pharmacy. They don’t even ask for my ID. I just call them monthly to request a refill and they do it. I only have to see my doctor every 3 months, just to check in and make sure my meds are still working. I’ve even filled my meds up to a week early and it’s never been an issue. It’s total bullshit that she’s having issues with the pharmacy. She just sounds like a vindictive asshole who wants patients to suffer because that have a disorder they can’t control. Please complain about her to the clinic and request a new doctor!"
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,She did a massive self-report there. She clearly doesn't 'believe' in ADHD and has a vendetta against ADHD patients where she purposely reduces their dosage no matter what their previous history was. You need to drop her ASAP if you can.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Yeah this is annoying. Honestly what I've done in the past is only go to doctors who have been recommended by my friends with ADHD as providers who genuinely understand what ADHD is like. That way I know I won't have to face any nonsense. My current PCP didn't even ask to see my documentation, she saw that I had ADHD on my file, asked me what dosage I take and prescribed it. I trust her a lot, and if she says ""we might need to switch out your medication because of XYZ reason"" I will actually follow her advice _because I know she genuinely cares about my health._ You can't be expected to follow a doctor's advice if she's being so rude and dismissive of you. I'm sorry you had to deal with this. Please write a review so other people don't have this terrible experience hopefully."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,from a person who has been in psychiatric care for years: your psychiatrist is actually off her fucking rocker. I would have ripped her a new asshole. Find a different psych and leave a dogshit review for your current one online
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,">This isn't a medication you 'NEED', it's a 'nice to have',

This suggests she dose not specialize in ADHD. Maybe she has a significant number of ADHD patients but she's obviously not a specialist. 

People with ADHD who are not medicated become high risk for losing their jobs, becoming addicts or alcoholics, and even death. She seems more concerned with her own stuff rather than the Hippocratic oath. Report her and look for an actual ADHD specialist."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Every person ive met that claims to be an “adhd expert” has been fucking awful. How do they get that title??
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Please document all of your communication with her and get a new doctor.

She’s not ok, and she should not be treating ad/hd patients"
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,You need to change psychiatrists immediately and she NEEDS to lose her license
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"That is disgusting. 

""not a medication you need""?! What the hell?!

I want to see a single person without ADHD survive a day in my head. That is the most ridiculous BS I have ever heard. 

Sorry dude, you gotta find another Doc."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"OMG dude that was horrific!!!

Those words should never be uttered by your psychiatrist!

I basically just went full private for my doc, and found the best one I could. All he wants to do is help me achieve my goals, and goes by what I report in my med log. 

I'm on a pretty high dose of vyvanse, double max manufacturer recommended, and he says that it should be up to the doctor to know how much to treat their patients with. He made me do a heart stress test and all that stuff beforehand, too. 

I absolutely, 100% would not have been able to achieve what I have the last couple of years if not for him. It costs me a pretty penny, but it's the best investment in terms of ROI I've ever made."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"I would be curious to see her response if you called her again and said the following. Last time we spoke, you said some very hurtful things. I don't appreciate being demonised because Im asking for the dose I've been on for the past 8 years. If you cared about your patients like you claim to, one would think you would be more compassionate and understanding about your patients previous treatment history.

The way she acted towards you speaks volumes about her insecurity of prescribing meds to people that probably don't need it."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,[deleted]
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Please, report this person and continue to advocate for yourself and your own care. This was completely inappropriate for any licensed medical professional.

For what it's worth, I think when she said about ADHD medication being ""nice to have"" and not ""need"" she meant along the lines of it not being life-sustaining in the same way as insulin for example. It doesnt make it ok, and ADHD medication has a massive quality-of-life improvement effect, something all medical professionals should be aiming for."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Hahhahaha. She says it like the people who «take what they get and don’t complain» are not the addicts smh
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"She chose the wrong profession. Adhd can be disabling, and lack of treatment can lead to so many other unmitigated conditions. What in the actual hell is wrong with her? So sorry for your experience, and yes please get away from her as soon as humanly possible. She’s out of line, and will try to put false statements in your records, thus preventing you from receiving your proper medication dosages in the future. Sending good thoughts for your next visit with a new practitioner. Take care of yourself:)"
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,She needs to be reported to the state licensing board. Save that message. I'm so sorry that she treated you that way. She's a poor excuse for a mental health practitioner and she certainly won't take her patients seriously unless she is taken to task for how she spoke to and treated you. Please find a new psych and PLEASE report her so that this doesn't continue to happen.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Ya, when I changed doctors once (previous psych moved states) thr next one i met with asked me if I had tried swimming daily."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Yeah I had a heck of a time trying to even get my rx filled with regular adderall. Literally no pharmacy in my area that accepted insurance has it. Period. I called my doctor and explained that I couldn’t get my medication bc of a shortage. I returned the original script. So the doctor wrote for another stimulant, it was $400 without prior authorization… when I went back and returned the rx she just flat out handed another adderall rx and said she wouldn’t write me anything else because she had already written me 3 prescriptions (which I brought back the first two). Finally I went to a pharmacy not in network and paid out of pocket for the adderall because I was desperate. The lady at the doctors office basically said the doctor wasn’t going to help me bc ‘I could have already gotten the adderall’ with the first rx- to which I responded HOW?! I was told over and over that there is a national shortage. So frustrating. I felt like an inconvenience and a drug addict."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Report her to the licensing professionals and give her a shite review on Google and your insurance's website. She should face real repercussions for this. Completely unprofessional, what a terrible doctor."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Report. Report. Report.  Can’t even finish reading this it’s so distressing 😰 can’t believe there are “professionals” like this out there.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Damn. Did she even bother to look through your medical records to see how you and your prior psych determined the correct dosage for you?

You should report her.  You aren't a ""new patient."" You are new to her, there's a difference."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"That doage would just make me sleep. 

I had similar issue, desperately needing to get back on meds after relocating. Explained issues. Dr said, ""So now you want a magic bullet"".

No, for me it's like being blind, and then having something gives you sight for a portion of the day, in an environment that's hostile to blind people. I'm not after a magic bullet; I need a vague hope that there's some chance getting through otherwise normal things is even possible. 

I struggle to organize so much I spent two years with just piles, unable to move because of them. Never a clue how long organizational tasks would take. It's alway been terribly hard on partners and others who've cared about me. 

All sorts of other very typical symptoms, but very severe.

Ritalin has never worked for me. It's the reason I stopped treatment.

They started me again on Ritalin, despite my objections. It's the best sleep aid ever. Raised the dose, slept harder. It was lovely, being able to sleep so well, but... 

Dex and it's friends and relations help far more, but still fighting sleep.

With drugs that could be abused, all the focus seems to be on the abusers - better to punish a thousand innocents than let one person have fun or study or whatever the heck they're using it for.

But let's be honest - psych and pain meds are hard to access, even for those with substantial resources - financial and otherwise - and no red flags (as in legal issues for accessing them another way).

An awful lot of people are absolutely forced to self-medicate.

Given the tremendous difference medication makes in my life, and being close to some who've gone through incomprehensible amounts of pain (pain meds, you'd really better have a lot of money and high social status), it's no mystery why.

So, how many ""abusers"" are even really abusers?"
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Your shrink needs a shrink ...she got issues!!
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Double check to make sure she's an actual psychiatrist and not just a nurse practitioner. Most of these video services are run by nurse practitioners with a special mental health certificate. And they say insane things like this.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"kneecaps is nothing you NEED its a ""nice to have"". I would like to tell individuals like her but than I would probably get into trouble.  
(still unmedicated here)"
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"I would post that publicly on review spaces about her and report her, myself."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"That bitch's behaviour is also to blame thanks to people abusing these meds, there's decent folk like you using it simply to exist and be competent, and there's fuckers that use it to either resell or get high. I wish NTs could not get high off these.

Either way, switch psychiatrists and report her."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"I find it interesting that this doctor implicitly admitted she prescribes controlled substances to patients without a legitmate medical purpose. If she doesn't believe ADHD is a ""real thing"" and stimulants are simply ""nice to have,"" then why is she writing all those prescriptions? 

My guess is that this doctor prescribes stimulants to patients who do not have ADHD and are just looking to ""get ahead"" and lumped you in with the rest of them. 

I imagine the DEA would be interested to know her prescribing patterns and practices."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"And she “specializes” in ADHD? Oh my god… that woman needs her license revoked. The amount of times I needed a dose adjustment before finding the one that worked for me, and even then I had to have a “booster” dose added for longer study days… I’m so sorry that happened!!"
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Please report her-- this is clearly happening to many people. Also find a new psychiatrist.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Most psychiatrists have their own psychiatric issues untreated. So please leave this cranky dunce and find a new one. Her behavior is not normal and she should get her own life together a bit better before trying to help others. She is probably young herself is my guess? Older psychs tend to be all about over prescribing and getting their perks from the drug manufacturers. But probably the new and coming psychs are under more scrutiny. She actually probably has you mixed up with other patients. Sounds like she is a very stressed out cranky and over her head therapist and personally I say she sounds toxic. Leave her. She lacks professionalism. And I do not think it is safe to even be under the care of a psychiatrist who can not separate different aspects of their life and act professionally. Do not give her another cent. Don't encourage that kind of unethical nonsense.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Oh my. This person should not be allowed to practice. This complete lack of sympathy, professionalism, basic human kindness from *anyone* is unsettling, but this person is supposed to be helping you and caring for your psychiatric health? Oh, I don't think so...this person is vile! I am SO sorry that you experienced this; you deserve so much better than this ""professional"" who is anything but. :("
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,What the actual fuck
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"{preface, this is only my opinion and by no means do I think the majority of docs are bad}

Sorry to be direct but ditch that biatch. What she did breaks so many rules, ethics and qualities. She was rude, she talked about other patients (hippa violation) did not continue on the dose you were at (plain old medically risky) she was demeaning to you and all people with ADHD, she’s no specialist to name a few things that disgusted me. 

Here is what I believe for 54 years of experience. A good pharmacologist is difficult to find so you need to “shop” and try them a few sessions. A good psychologist is the same, test 4-5 of them or your doing a serious disservice to yourself. As someone who was diagnosed almost 40 years ago I have dealt with all kinds. 

When going to a Therapist/psychologist (I’m ready to get flamed) every 3-4 years find a new therapist. They all get stale. Your the patient. Personally I always go in with a piece of paper with several areas I feel could be helped, and so I can write notes. If none of what I believe my needs are being addressed with tools to help then I’m done with them. 
I have found the easiest way to find a great experienced pharmacologist is your local “teaching” hospital. Sometimes you even have to try a couple there. 


FYI - some docs don’t want to take any risks after the most recent drug crisis with doctors, but that’s not Dex. 

Move on and take care of yourself. Don’t bother reporting her even though she should be reprimanded. The licensing boards and state are worthless so don’t waste your time. Been there done that. 

Don’t feel upset or bad, She was completely wrong and I’m sorry you have to deal with this. I know it’s harder to manage being treated poorly when you have ADHD (IMO)

Be kind to yourself. Feel free to ping me direct."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Honestly this psychiatrist needs to go see a psychiatrist.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,I would report her to a board. That’s totally unacceptable
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"“Drugs r bad mkay”

Can I be psychologist now"
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Should of said I bet your job was nice to have but you won't be needing it anymore 💀
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Bro I’m pretty sure you can get her in trouble for saying that what the entire fuck lmao

u probably should by writing a review of her on one of those sites for reviewing docs that way she knows u weren’t just looking to score and so hopefully she can not be such a quack to the next patient (followed with you finding a new one)

tho as an aside 40-60mg is the adult upper limit dosing range for d-amph so maybe since you mentioned that range exactly it kinda set her off into thinking ur just gaming her for speed but she still came at you very unhinged"
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,This is completely unprofessional for her to say to you. She clearly does not specialize in ADHD…I would have a hard time not reporting her.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Probably recently got investigated by the DEA and the Board because she was seen as a potential “loose prescriber” so to speak. Obviously she’s incredibly stressed out and directing that towards you. Doesn’t make it right or acceptable, I’d get a new psychiatrist stat and also report her somehow because that’s incredibly messed up especially if you’re asking for dosages you have taken before. You know what works for you, that is why they ask how we are responding to the meds!"
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"I really think she could get in trouble for saying that. She’s making it very sensitive and personal to begin with, which crosses a professional boundary already. That’s not something a professional would be so honest about normally. Idk if this is the best analogy but sometime healthcare is like finding out that expensive bag you just bought is a fake. It’s best to stick to larger medical groups or companies."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Fuck that doctor. Tbh she’s probably over prescribing those other patients who don’t need it like that. Anytime I have doctor changes this happens to me about 2-3 times before I can get a doctor that listens and is willing to help. Also I’m on adderall, klonopin, nuerotin, and ambien. My conditions are well documented and my meds are justifiable. Find a new doctor in network if possible, but I have definitely sucked it up and paid cash when I cant find someone in network who is willing to listen. You should be able to choose your provider. I am 100% for universal healthcare, but if u look how Kaiser and Ambetter are operating it’s a really grim look at what socialized healthcare will look like."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,At the  op I'm so so so sorry you had to go through this like you I have a History of ADHD that has been documented. It has been a nightmare to be approved. And again I've been stuck with a generic that doesn't work well and gives me more side affects then benefits at time. Because I can be approved for the brand name. I also asked for  an increase multiple times. And even my doctors like ummm let's not right away. I just got this approved today . But still still sticking to the 30xr dose where I think I may need a 40 or 60 mg dose. . Or at least 30 mg it bc Ive taken two 15mg tried or even three and it worked well. Better then normal. But the generic brand of make something is less effective than say the Teva brand. Teva generic is sold out or just out of stock in my area but everyone has the brand name well ...  But I need prior authorization for that for every lil Change to my medicine.  My psychiatrist. Understand that a higher dose of 60 is actually normal for some. But my primary sees that as excessively high I think. But my psychiatrist isn't taking and ADHD people bc it's suck a pain in the ass hard core pain in the ass  to write and jump throu hops to get the scripts filled every month it a whirl wind.    I'm upset about the generic I get stuck with bc it increases my anxiety and is less effective but I can afford 237 or 287 for brand name out of pocket 😭 but that would give me consistent y.  But definitely find a new doctor
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Sorry OP, your new psych definitely handled this wrong.

 I'm curious though, were you prescribed the higher dosage before? And if so, can't you just ask your PCP to refill the prescription you were previously prescribed?"
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,What an ableist fuck. Report her. What type of response is this for someone trying to find the most therapeutic dosing. Christ.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Wtf that's messed up! Definitely switch to another doctor, omg! She has issues that are not your problem, wtfffff"
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Report her to the board.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Lmao do we have the same doctor
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,I always take my phone out and ask them to repeat shit like that.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Wish you recorded that shit .. my new dr in same practice cut my meds because my dr went to jail for talking to other doctors about SUBSYS. Said I’m nothing like him , she sure isn’t , she has no time to do my shots I get every month since I’m diagnosed with the most painful disease u don’t directly from … 3 months later, she’s decided I’m not lying. Why are we at their mercy?"
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Find a new doctor. That is just crazy and totally unprofessional
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"This reaction would have me seeing red.  

I've lived enought of my adult life without the meds to know that without REAL medical help, I'm just stuck in poverty.  The effects this would have on my career, my living conditions, the debt is have... 

It's fucking needed.  In a perfect world, this phone call would get her decertified, not properly treating you.

No sympathy.  She's getting this stress because she's hurting people, and clearly she needs to get a lot more stressed out before she stops hurting people. 

Fuck this woman."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Insist on finding a new therapist and repeat verbatim what she told you to her superior (in the event you're working via some service).
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"See, things like this are why I put off going to the psych. My therapist has been advocating for me to go and be diagnosed, and will write a letter advocating for me, but I haven’t made an appointment yet bc I’m so afraid of being dismissed."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Can you report her? So unprofessional! Not a great psychiatrist if she undermedicates her patients on purpose.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Fire the bitch and report her to the state medical board for conduct unbecoming.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Wow! I'm speechless. I'm shocked that her attitude is *""just be happy with whatever dosage you get""* instead of *""I should prescribe the optimal medication dosage for each individual's needs and physiology.""* Why did she change your dosage to begin with?! If you were doing fine on 40-60 mg/day, why did she suddenly switch you to 30? You wouldn't have had to ask if she had just kept your treatment the same.

I'm sure she has her frustrations with her job, but that's no excuse to \*ever\* talk to a patient like that. She's the one who chose her career path, not you.

If it's possible, I would start looking for other doctors that take your insurance and see if you can switch in the next couple months. I just wouldn't feel comfortable going back to a provider who spoke to me in that way."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,I'm no psychologist but clearly she's either projecting or has a guilty conscience
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Glad you quickly found yourself a NEW new psych. I’d report them too, absolutely unprofessional."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Some of these people act like giving any dose of stimulant is them doing you a favor. 

When I was switched from adderall to vyvance, the dose did not match up per mg, and it made me have a discontinuation syndrome. 

I called their office twice and was told both times by his rude secretory that, “he could have given you 10mg, not 20” when I was saying I believed the low dose to be causing me to feel sick. I got the impression that they were telling me to shut up and be grateful I got any at all.

I haven’t experienced someone this awful though. Report."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Lol id have her license revoked by end of day if she spoke to me like that. Shit would be on the channel 9 news. Id sue for discrimination. Im petty asf when someone pisses me off
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"“Nice to have?” Seriously? OMG, I was having a good morning and now I’m pissed the fuck off. She should not be treating anyone with ADHD because she has no clue how it works and views patients who have it with disdain. I’ve never had a doctor treat me like this, so I don’t think this is representative of most doctors. Sorry that happened to you, and I hope you find another doctor who isn’t a horrible person."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Don’t be shy, share her office information with us"
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"This is utterly outrageous. Other people, including medical professionals, don't get to tell us what medication we need. That's our job because we are the ones living with the condition. It's not our problem that medical science can't explain minds or consciousness or why we are chronically under-stimulated. If they are so fucking clever, why don't they have an ADHD measurement and remove all doubt in the matter?

Comparing one patient to another doesn't contribute to your care in any meaningful way and is completely unprofessional. Make your case to the doctor again and record everything that was said and the outcome. If you are not satisfied, file a complaint to the governing body or a psychiatric association with clout. Present your factual evidence.

I have been in the same situation and it enrages me just think about how ignorant and bigoted even educated people can be, never mind ones that are supposed to be caring for us."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"She should lose her license. If there's a body to report this to, you should."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Switch to a different psychiatrist  IMMEDIATELY!
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Depending on where you are and what the governing psychiatric board says you can report her for this. It is extremely unprofessional to yell at someone like that for the medication they need. She has no right to treat you like an addict. It's her problem, not yours."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Would she be saying the same thing to someone who is prone to seizures regarding their seizure meds? Would she be saying that to someone with depression regarding their anti deps? This sounds like extreme bias coming from this psychiatrist as well as terrible boarder line harmful medical advice. The only thing she would lose her medical license over is this type of rhetoric, undermining a patients medical condition and refusing them treatment counts as malpractice."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Do I need my medicine for ADHD? No. Did I flood my kitchen the last time I ran out of it because I got caught in a distraction hole? Yes.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Totally unprofessional. You should really find a new doctor, and when you do make sure you report her. It makes me wonder if she's actually doing some shady stuff. What she said screams some level of guilt."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Does she not realize that “normal” people don’t need a psychiatrist?
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,What she is doing is emotional manipulation and probably medical gaslighting. You know your needs. You are not a new patient. She is failing as a healthcare provider and harming you in the process.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Find a new doctor. You shouldn't be shamed by someone you're supposed to trust with your mental wellbeing.

Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Wow. Just fucking wow. This bitch should not be a psychiatrist
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"In my opinion. Report the bitch. And contact your previous doctors and their offices for their files on you. If you're on good terms with them, explain the situation. If you're uncomfortable the  just say it's for court purposes or something. Maybe get a lawyer quick. They did this to you, you have no idea how many people they've treated in this manner or worse. That's likely malpractice. Prescription without diagnosis. It's not a crime to have adhd."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"I just had this experience with a pharmacist- my medication was scheduled in the CVS system to be filled today and I called to see if it was ready- the pharmacist belittled me, lectured me, and condescended me asking ""if there's a reason I need to pick up the medication so early"" but it was the day CVS themselves scheduled for refill :( I've been sobbing for hours since that call, feeling so small and disgusted by myself. I wish I had words of advice but I wanted to thank you for sharing your experience, as it really made me feel much less alone. I hope you're able to find a respectful, compassionate psychiatrist who really can help you in the way you need- and that they are supposed to.

Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Sounds like she was taking out her negative emotions (probably anger and frustration from what your post says) on you, which is totally unprofessional. I'd say find another prescriber who treats you with respect and is willing to listen. If she makes such a drastic change in your dosing, she should be able to speak to why, and if not, yeah, still, find another prescriber who treats you with respect. Not a good way to respond to a patient, period. Not ever."

Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,I don’t know where u live but in uk if a Dr spoke to me disrespectfully I would ask for their GMC registration number and look up complaints process. You can haul up Doctors for behaving disrespectfully here more easily than the if they make a clinical error. Everyone makes mistakes but there is no excuse for abusing a position of power.

Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"It can be difficult to balance what's best for a patient in terms of medication and risking your license. I can understand being hesitant to a point.

That said, my issue is that she didn't discuss it with you. It wasn't until you picked up your medication that you realized the issue. From her complaint, it sounds like you aren't the only one she's done this to. No one calls a pharmacy to confirm a dose change that has already been discussed.

It's clinically irresponsible to not have a discussion with someone prior to or at the time of a dose change. It breaks trust immediately."

Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Bad medical mental and educational helpers are everywhere. I don’t know how they still have jobs after all crap they pull. Like teachers hitting students doctors denying your own experience and knowledge ie( Serena Williams blood clotting issue) shaming individuals seeking aide. They do harm to the vulnerable population and claim to be professional who uphold moral ethic codes of conduct. A really big one are police who fear for lives or are too scared to do their job shouldn’t have been police in the first place. Police who rob or cheat the system for their own profits shouldn’t be police. Public servants must be selfless and to help others reach their best life. Jail is supposed to help people be better humans but obviously that’s not the case.

The system or community that handles the HR process used when hiring is broken. Too many people who don’t know how to do there jobs. We need to make sure that people actually want to be there and help others without being big headed or scary booties. They need to be fired all of them the moment they have evidence of these kinds of actions but of course that’s doesn’t happen nearly as much as it should. All of us should have access to quality health and education and protection with people who are ethically and morally in-tune with other people."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Wow. That is incredibly terrible. I'm so sorry. Definitely find someone new and make sure to share any historical documentation you have as well to make sure you get the appropriate level of care without the suspicion.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,What a fucking bitch
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,What about online for now until u get straight
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Good luck Op
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,I had to stop and take a moment after the addict comment. Holy shit.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"To my understanding this is because of the Narcotic-Epidemic. But some doctors have made this into a business rather than helping, they prefer to keep their job. I had a similar experience with a dentist of all people. Every time something like this happens it makes me so angry I am already being shamed/judged for my Meds i don't need it from you of all people. 
I feel bad for you OP. I would try and find someone better. And you should probably report this person to the Board or the governing authority.(Even though because of bureaucracy  it would probably result in nothing)"
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,You could ask for more again but record it and send it to their boss.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Is there a way to submit a formal complaint about her?

Because she sounds like she deserves it.

Also start looking for a new doctor ASAP."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Yeah you need a different prescriber asap and I would report her to your local medical board. That is not an ok way to handle a patient’s questions.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"This therapist gives the vibe of a narcissist, like proper NPD."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,I would immediately drop them and I would report them to their state board. That is unprofessional and completely uncalled for.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"By that logic, any medication that is not actively keeping you alive is not a 'need', just a 'nice to have'. What a quack."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,You should report that doctor immediately. Sounds like they violated several parts of their code of ethics!
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Hope you get what you need eventually ❤️ I've just stopped my meds because of financial issues, so I can relate..."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"I almost downvoted you because I was reading her response as the “OP” and I just wanted to rage so hard! Oh FFS, who is so crazy and a medical professional. I would report her."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"That's do odd, and unprofessional! 😓"
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"I would have just stared at her...I am horrible with responding to disrespect from authoritative figures. Gobsmacked, seriously. What a horrid woman. Please report her."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Sounds like someone who has no business treating people for developmental disorders.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Here's your action plan- first, figure out in your state how to file a complaint with the medical board. Do that ASAP.

Second- call the doctor's office and ask to speak to writers in charge. Tell them about this provider and this incident. Then tell them you are not returning to that office/group. 


 Third, call your insurance and ask to speak to the ombudsman, and file another complaint. Your ombudsmen should be able to get you a different doctor that will work with your plan in a case like this. 


Fourth- call your old doctor and tell them what's up. Maybe they can accept your insurance or get at least the process started to accept your insurance. If they can't, they may be able to give you a sliding scale price for visits. 

Lastly - depending on your HR dept and company- tell your HR what's going on and ask when insurance is going to change. If the company has heard enough complaints about poor providers covered under the plan provider, they may be more inclined to change insurance providers. One of the big reasons people leave jobs is because of health insurance. 



If you went to this provider with an existing diagnosis and medication regiment that worked, they never should have messed with it. Your pharmacy and previous insurance will be able to back up how long you've been on the meds you were on."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"I had a Doctor from India that was over the top paranoid about ADHD medication, his prescription writing and thinking the DEA would pull his license.  This guy was such a looney-tune idiot that even though he knew I was in law enforcement he would accuse me of selling my medications.  Right pal, I'm going to risk my pension to earn a couple extra hundred bucks chump change.  Then the pharmacists who do not understand what 30 days means when it is day 29 on Saturday and they aren't open on Sunday so I need a pill for Monday morning (because I have to leave for work before they open, small town)"
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Well.. she should lose her license.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Same here i got stares when I go to the pharmacy to get my meds
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"yea you should report her, what a terrible psychiatrist"
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"I have a new physician, and I'm having the exact same fight. Apparently, to them, it's a privilege to have the agency to control how and when you do a job you already have. The whole ongoing process has created so much anxiety that I've had to give up on my social life just to make sure my work gets done."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"I was put on meds after being diagnosed with ADHD in 2016 and they changed my life, ended up coming off of them last December because I was treated like this every time I ordered refills. I can't even count how many times refills were 30-60 days late being filled and if I called to complain, I was told there are no adverse effects caused by going on and off the medication."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,I’m so sorry that happened to you. Good for you for finding another provider right away.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Sounds like you need a new doctor. You have to remember that doctors are people too and not all people are good or smart for that matter. My doctor took me off of Strattera (which was really helping me) and put me on Prozac instead. Let that one sink in. So I said “bye bitch.” Talk to your insurance company and see if they offer any other options, like telemed or another doctor in your area. You might be surprised with the outcome."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Find a new phych now u don’t need that. It’s supposed to be the one person in the world u can trust with anything and this is how ur treated? Honestly I’m discusted. I am all for empathy I’m sure she does get a lot of annoying calls about meds and I’m sure a lot of her patients are addicts. But u chose this profession she should be empathetic towards her clients not hostile. I couldn’t imagine I’m so sorry. It’s not your fault at all
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"So you used to get prescribed 40-60mg per day, and this doc reduced it to 30mg and then yelled at you? Whatever happened, the rapport seems to have been seriously broken, and you need a new Dr now. (Does it have to be a psychiatrist in your country? In mine, regular ""family doctors"" are also able to prescribe ADHD meds)"
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Okay, you need to report that bitch yesterday. That’s not acceptable."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"She can go to hell for talking to *anyone* like that lmao, let alone someone paying for her service.

I wish I could do some niche magic that just allows me to grant snobby medical professionals with ADHD ranging from 24hrs to indefinitely, depending on their offense. 

This medication is “nice to have”? *BAM abracadabra you’ve been granted 5 years of ADHD symptoms, miss! With no treatment regimen, as it’s futile anyway!* Good luck!! 🍀 

I’m angry for you, but mostly, I hope you get the treatment you need without the bullshit you don’t deserve. I hear you, and no; I really don’t think this treatment should be expected. It shouldn’t be tolerated and I’m sick of it.

Edit: report dat shiz! We don’t need people making big buck off invalidating individuals with neurological disorders."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Get a new doctor immediately. I've had Drs like this and they fcked me up changing my dosage. RUN.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,The fact that you didn't threaten her with a quick shutdown over that makes you a bigger man than me. What a horrible person.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,My friend just got a new psychiatrist and and they’re making her take a much smaller dosage than what she’s had for years.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"I would consider reporting her to the board. I had a doctor who had a similar type of answer on some things and I wish I had said something. 

It sounds like she’s having trouble with her billing/coding or maybe she already got in trouble. Still not someone you want in control of you meds.

Find someone knew in network"
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Wow sounds like she deserves a complaint to the state medical board, and you need to find a new psychiatrist again."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Get a new doc immediately. Or show your past scripts. Then maybe show some research
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,What is that psychiatrist’s name? I’d LOVE to speak with her state’s licensing board.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"In my general experience, providers are either vehemently opposed to prescribing any kind of controlled meds for any reason under any circumstance, or on the flip side essentially checked-out, blasé, or even professionally irresponsible or ethically negligent in regards to the extent at which they freely hand out controlled meds prescriptions at whim. There's rarely any sort of medium, middle-ground, or in between.

I've had some stubborn asshole docs occasionally flat out deny me my long-standing well-established regular routine course of meds based on their own subjective unfounded nonsense, nonfactual arbitrary biases, or tepid, pissy-diaper-baby, and vague regard for their personal professional ethical duties, values, and responsibilities as respectable legitimate trained medical practitioners. I've had other providers straight up look me directly in the eye and say ""yeah sounds good, anything else??"" in response to any nearsighted, impulsive, knee-jerk request for any rx adjustments or med changes, be they controlled or anything otherwise, that I've ever asked of them whether any part of that was well-intentioned or I was really trying to game the system in order to have a bit of forbidden fun.

I personally prefer the latter type to the former. I genuinely consider myself as effectively fulfilling the basic role and responsibility of an experienced, informed, and qualified consumer who should absolutely be granted ample say, influence, and opinion in the prescription process."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,are you really allowed to talk to your patients like this??? i’m so sorry this happened to you.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,As a former psychiatry resident that sounds like a very poor shrink to me. You should definitely change doctors. It can be tough dealing with new patients dosages and not be taken advantage of. Still if you don‘t trust your patients how can you ask them to trust you. Maybe you have old prescriptions or letters from your previous doctors you could show her. Maybe the pharmacy can give you a copies of previous receipts or something. Then you could prove your previous dosage to her. Still I‘d look for a better shrink
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Good lord I have no words for what kind of bs that is... I've been medicated all my life (different health issues than ADHD) which I am absolutely dependent on if I am to even be alive. I need the optimal dosage or I'll stop functioning within a couple of months. If this were to happen and they gave me the same bs as OP got every time I got a new doctor I am fairly sure they would have killed me a few hundred times over.
Just... What the actual ****??? Any sound doctor would and *should* take note of the patient's journal and of what has been working so far instead of pulling a stunt like this and blame it on the patient to make themselves look better on paper. Christ... I hope you get a better psychiatrist, OP. That nutter you had that run-in with clearly shouldn't be licenced because they obviously don't know damn shit

(Also, she had **multiple** patients making complaints about this?? Jesus Christ and she didn't even stop to think that maybe their patients had a point?? 😒🤦🏼‍♀️ What an absolute idiot)"
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Change that hoe she a bitch that hasn't learned that being a shrink means that you need to put your personal opinion aside and put forth your professionalism all she could have done was ask okay what's the matter is everything alright and why such much lol and the answer would have been 60 mgs then fuck she can check your medical records because she has a licence or even call your previous shrink and make an honest to God right decision but she had to explode in your face like a psycho sheeesh
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"I came up with an analogy that might help someone else in similar situation… 

My ADHD medication is like a mobility device for my brain. 

Is it NECESSARY to have a top of the line wheelchair for every person needing a mobility device, nor is it useful to only give everyone needing a mobility device a cane. You can’t tell what is working the other 719.5 hours in the month you don’t see me without asking me and believing me, I’m telling you that a cane is not working, but crutches have worked in the past and work well for me. (Or whatever)

I’m using this example not to throw shade or disrespect towards folx who use/need mobility devices, nor to imply that their needs are routinely met, or was just a comparison I saw in my mind that I thought others might understand. ♥️"
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"I’m sorry that happened to you. People like this don’t deserve to be doctors, they think they know what they’re doing yet they have never attempt to actually understand the patient. Especially when they never had a mental disability. I call that bullshit and unprofessional."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Never ever let someone especially a doctor make you feel less or talk to you like this. Report her and find a new doctor right away. Once you find a doctor that is understanding and caring you’ll wonder how you ever dealt with anything else.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"unfortunately you're most likely going to experience this at some point due to bad actors in our society and taking a highly stigmatized medicine. I've gone through it too. You just have to fight for your rights to live your best life.   


Currently the pharmacy near me won't even fill orders for adhd meds, they are saying they are out of stock its really annoying.  Luckily I finally found a doctor who will prescribe me adderall without giving me a hard time.  I might try to have it sent to another pharmacy . It is a hastle and its getting me down. Im suffering from being unmedicated and trying to self medicate. I just dont want to seem sketchy if I tell my doctor to send it to another pharmacy"
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Happy with whatever dosage they get? and she calls herself an ADHD specialist? the fuck? probably the most important thing in ADHD meds is tweaking dosages and trying different meds
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"medication shortages resolved on 5/29/22.. that being said... my doctor is incredible, very understanding and I can see why they are so aggravated with this whole shit show, unfortunately I'm going to be honest.. like most controlled meds of that schedule, you are always looked at as an addict.. first, more so with pain meds.. but I recently moved, to so flo... and I literally got screamed at for having my dosage increased to 3 x daily, before finally sticking with XR... just to save face.. I think most doctors are just kinda insulted, that people come in their with their own treatment plans.. Adderall is slightly more addictive, that being said I've been on it for 25 years of my 30 year old life. So I try to not step on toes, but I will say if I come in asking about a brand, when they clearly see a record of having been prescribed it.. I get all shit eyed, I haven't ever had a doc treat me with that disrespect, in the same purposes I'd respond well most doctors are happy to receive a dollar from me but learning you can't just be a prick to everyone, look at your history.. try to give them the benefit, but that was unprofessional as hell what they said... now as to anything that we can do about it? Give up dependence on pills until they come up with another chemical we all shove into our cocktails.."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Yeah this is pretty standard, doctors tend to be suspicious.  I was a well achieving student with zero criminal record and they treated me like a drug addict for wanting a medication I had proof that Ive been on since I was a kid.

Doctors don't listen, they want you out the door asap.  Especially if you are a woman they just don't understand and aren't willing to try.  Larger cities seem to have better doctors in my experience.

All that being said, usually doctors are more subtle than this lady.  What she said is downright disrespectful, medication shouldnt be distributed on a ""you get what you get"" basis, but again doctors tend to be shitty."

Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,medication shortages?
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Uhhh did you stop your meds at any time? Because otherwise this is actually a very dangerous thing to do!

Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"God taught me a valuable lesson, this shit is a gift for us. Tldr high doses of straight dex er+ir for yrs changed my life. Then I lost everything and couldn't do a job application. Took lots of different drs and therapists to get just a low dose of generic Ritalin.

Having to ""save up"" 3 days of Ritalin just to function, period, for only 3hrs or so was amazing but I learned how hard it can be to find a solution.

Hang in there man. Don't give up. Be patient. It f-ing sucks, but adhd sucks worse. And don't put your energy into more negative shit like anything strictly from resentment that won't get you to your goals any quicker. The world right now needs hope and especially people with adhd, anything else is wasted energy. 

Trust me, being on nothing a few times for months, one realizes that anything is better than nothing.....
And work up from there. Find another dr somehow. Call somewhere where they just give you anyone and catch the one that believes you. Then only see them. Think outside the box. 
These are brutal times, I also have Asperger's and some BPD or unipolar dpr, not important bc my adhd meds work on those too (a little).
But you gotta be positive and stick with it. And create positive interactions with people. For the first time in 40 yrs have I seen the default attitude of the average person to be pessimistic. But there's an opportunity there. What goes around comes around, tenfold in a good way. 
Remember that you don't deserve anything. So expect to have to ask. That's all. 

Best,
J"
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Absolutely report her. Even if that's how she feels, that shit is not acceptable behavior."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Agreed. People who abuse the system and cause shortages absolutely suck but she hardly knows you it seems. Ironically she seems to admit to being to being a white collar drug dealer writing prescriptions for other patients she doesn’t think need the medication.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Thank you, and hah I actually see now that my post title might have been a bit extreme, I think it was just my gut reaction of shock about what had just happened.  But the quote itself is indeed exactly what she said to me on the video call."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Not even a two bit therapist saying this lol literally a psych, the one person that should never even think like this let alone say it

Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Seriously what the hell.  I got a new primary doctor last year, told her I have ADHD and was diagnosed at 10, and let her know what medications I’ve used in the past. No hesitation or accusatory questioning, she asked me how it’s been affecting my life currently (I went back to college) and what my schedule is like, then started me on a low dose of Adderall and that was that. And when it needed to be adjusted I went in and again, that was all. The worst of it was a random pee test a few months in, which was only shitty because my insurance decided not to cover it."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"I second this. Totally unprofessional and absolutely rude. Especially if shes working with people who are mentally ill!! Like imagine if shed said that to someone who was suicidal! 

Report that bitch!"
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Also if she admits the drug is unnecessary then technically she shouldn’t provide it at all
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"If someone specializes in ADHD then they should know there's a sweet spot for dosages. So that fact that she said he's ""fine"" on 30mg is absurd. The difference in 10mg can be a night and day difference in terms of its effectiveness for that person to the point where taking a lower than optimal dose is essentially the equivalent of taking nothing. Talk about ignorant."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Plenty of people need the script but don't think they can argue with the doctor because their doctor is a pos like her.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Yeah I know right!  I would think the people who are ""barely contacting her"" should be her concern too, at the very least.  Problems don't stop existing just because they are out of sight and out of mind."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Or they're like me, who after decades of having trouble getting consistent help have become too pussyfooted to advocate for themselves.  

Regular docs flat won't prescribe adhd meds.  Every time I've asked I've ended up on antidepressants.  And adult ADHD psychiatrists are usually booked out months in advance.  And even then it's hit or miss whether they'll prescribe you something that actually helps, or push you onto something that's ""safe"" for them to prescribe."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Damn yeah this probably exactly it too lol
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"While I'm personally very scared to disagree with a Dr, this is an excellent point either way."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Medical board for the state, which is responsible for licensing is who a complaint should be directed to. We can also complain to the doctor's office itself (more beneficial if they're part of a medical group versus practicing independently) as well as report to the insurance company who can drop them from their network."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,I think it’s a recipients rights complaint but not sure.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"I really wish I did think to record the interaction, but I appreciate the link to this primer, at the very least I feel more prepared should something like this happen again.  I will have to find out if I have enough evidence without an actual recording."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"I found this one on Zocdoc, which I feel like I have been over-relying on lately just because of how easy it is to instantly schedule appointments online.  But I'm starting to think maybe I should do what you did and take the extra time to look through my insurance network, since there seems to be many more doctors out there who are not on Zocdoc and I might be limiting my search too much."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,You think one month is long? Oh boy... 6 months minimum are normal around here if you have insurance. If you pay cash you still wait 1 month or longer.

Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"I have a thought and would like to know your opinion 🙋🏻‍♂️ 

>	Based off of my interaction with Schmuckatelli I do not believe this physician is adhering current evidence….

Specifically for this paragraph - wouldn’t it be better if OP were to say “This complaint is not about me being furious about how I was being treated, nor about coming after Schmuckatelli MD to seek revenge by attempting to get her suspended but solely about the safety of all patients including myself who not only have to continue rely but would be adversely affected if the system continues to fail”?"
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Thank you, that's helpful to know.  I definitely do need ways like this of pre-checking psychiatrists before I waste a bunch of time with them.  But I didn't think I'd ever have to worry about doctors not agreeing with the DSM-5, WOW"

Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Omg you're kidding?!!  This sounds potentially worse than what I experienced, I was still allowed the lower dose at the very least.

Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"like, get a job that's on an island?"
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Omg yes this is actually very similar to the process I would go through the past few months.  I start to feel like I'm walking on eggshells trying to revise prescriptions or requests and have to be nervous about ""asking too many questions"".  Like they might just call off the whole endeavor if I ask one too many times.  Do they not realize that we are asking BECAUSE we don't have anything yet??  If I'm being annoying with all my pestering and following-up it's because I currently have no medication and would like to get SOMETHING each day that I spend with withdrawal completely out-of-it at work."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"The thing about being able to see briefly and then it getting taken away from you.....that's heartbreaking and exactly how I felt with higher dose Dexedrine (and in another aspect, Zoloft for depression).  I need to remember that analogy to hopefully make people understand that my desperation comes from a DESPERATE NEED TO FUNCTION NORMALLY AGAIN and not this victim-blaming drug addiction story some people come up with.  

Also I too get sleepy on lower doses and I feel like that's even more proof that we truly NEED it and are not taking it for ""fun"".  Like psychiatrists are always surprised when I say that I can take Dexedrine at night just fine and have no trouble sleeping.  Yeah because it doesn't make me feel all drugged up and energized like non-ADHD people imagine it does, it mostly just makes me feel balanced."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Fr, the look I got from the pharmacist when I said I took two doses a day you’d think I’d said I was grinding it all into dust and injecting it 😩 a booster dose is really not that unheard of!

She kind of hit it on the nose herself when she comments on her license being pulled tho. Maybe on a subconscious level she knows treating patients like this means that it should 🤷🏻‍♀️"
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Perhaps. But the person OP is talking about, a psychiatrist, is a doctor who went to medical school then specialized in psychiatry. So you'd expect this person to be even more professional and educated than a psychologist who can't prescribe meds."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,">	I am 100% for universal healthcare, but if u look how Kaiser and Ambetter are operating it’s a really grim look at what socialized healthcare will look like.

No, probably not. Because it takes profit out of the equation. 

Also no networks. Most providers accept government insurance. It’s not legally required but it’s defacto required. 

In fact, my wife was unemployed during covid and we qualified for Medicaid. It was the best insurance I ever had. There were zero problems. They sent us a thing in the mail that basically said “hey, you guys have Medicaid now, if ou want” and that was it (I think. My wife may have had to fill something out so don’t quote me on that). They covered my meds without a hitch, and with zero billing issues or “pre qualification” paperwork required. And all the pharmacies were familiar with their system, because everyone deals with them.  

They proactively made my life easier. Whereas every other insurance has done the opposite in the hopes that if they just make ir annoying enough I’ll stop asking. 

If I could have bought in to Medicaid I would have done it in a heartbeat."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"I just got a new prescription sent in from a new doctor I was able to see quickly and everything is out of stock everywhere, so I have to wait again......I agree it really sucks how every little change needs so many approvals.  I am not even attempting to ask for anything else now because I feel like it will just slow everything down even more.  I'm sorry about your situation as well, I relate to it because I know for a fact that the higher doses helps me."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"It was last prescribed for me a couple of years ago - my most recent psychiatrists just didn't want to go that high because they also felt hesitant about higher doses I guess. I kind of gave up on finding one who would again until recently.  So I made this appointment just to ASK her about it, since I was remembering how I used to do better on the higher dose.  

And actually another ironic thing I forgot to mention in my original post - SHE was the one who gave me the idea in the first place!  In my last appointment, she suggested that maybe I would do better with taking more than 10mg at a time.  Which made her response this time extra bizarre and confusing."

Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Yeah I know right.  Now with a few more days' perspective I've started thinking maybe there was more to it that she was projecting about.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Yep I just had an appointment with a psychiatrist online at short notice.  No issues with him during that appointment but I'm too cynical now to make that judgment too early, hah.  He sent in 60mg but, just like last month, they said it's on back order and have no estimate of when it'll be available, so just have to wait and keep randomly calling to check.  But I guess that's a separate issue.........😓"
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,I am currently also still waiting on my re-sent Dexedrine because it's out of stock from 3 different sources!!

Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Have the shortages been resolved?  I hope that's true.....maybe I'm just unlucky then because I had to wait 3 weeks in June before they had my Dexedrine back in stock, which I just finally picked up."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Every Dexedrine refill for me recently has been super delayed and said to be ""on back order"" at every pharmacy I've tried (including Capsule here in NYC, a pharmacy that delivers medications), and this psychiatrist also mentioned something about medication shortages and apparently recent controversies about some startup company that was over-prescribing them during the pandemic?  Which she was using as a reason to be even less trusting about it.  I have no idea what she's talking about though and have not looked into it enough to know whether it's true for everyone."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Not an appropriate reason to deny a patient a prescription. It's not the doctors' job to ration meds.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,So her answering my video call in this unhinged way was the correct way to impart this great holy wisdom unto me?
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,But how am I trying to do anything without the doctor's approval?  How could I even?  I scheduled this appointment specifically to ask her for her approval.

Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Report her to the state licensing board as well.

Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Ask your previous clinic to forward your medical records to the new clinic so they have proof of your previous dosage. I’d also talk to your previous clinic about whether you should report this psychiatrist to someone. There is a professional and non-professional way of explaining you only prescribe a low dose to new patients and she chose the unprofessional way. My dad is a psychiatrist and has been sued twice for not prescribing a schedule 2 to a patient he felt did not need it (generally sedatives). He won both suits but that’s also an option. Sue her for her unprofessional conduct, loss of job productivity for failing to prescribe the right dose of a medication and emotional abuse. Obviously that’s an option that takes a fair bit of effort and may not be worth it to you but you would not be wrong for doing so."

Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"I think that's a very valid question. Bear in mind this is only my opinion, but by mentioning that you're not trying to get revenge, you're poisoning the well; the reader is going to be introduced to the idea you are seeking revenge just by you brining it up. Regan famously did that in one of his speeches around the time people questioned somebody so old running for POTUS:

> ""I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience."" 

&#x200B;

My experience having worked with the type of people who review complaints at licensing boards is they skim the complaint and fill out a form with subsection headers like ""complaint type"", ""harm type"", etc. You're going to grab their attention by throwing in healthcare buzz words like ""evidence based practice"". Additionally, focusing on what you *can't do* as a result of poor service you focus the reviewer's attention on how you are measurably being harmed. You establish a valid reason to complain and tell the reviewer a core competency that your provider is deficient on.

Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Unfortunately a lot of doctors don't think ADHD is real and that we are lazy and unmotivated but we know that is BS. The ones who say they specialize in ADHD are usually the ones who want to deal with kids only. Unless they specifically say Adult ADHD, I wouldn't take that as anything special. I always make sure to tell them that we are interviewing them to make sure they will be a good fit. The ones who get offended by that, I won't even bother with. I just tell them nevermind. Always remember that doctors are service providers and you can always take your business elsewhere. Some of them seem to forget that."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,I mean the DSM-5 has issues don't get me wrong but like... this is the book y'all supposed to use? But yeah those folks exist. A friend of mine had a therapist who didn't believe in depression... like my guy it's a diagnosis not the Tooth Fairy...
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"It’s out there I promise! When I figured out I probably had ADHD I told my dr and she referred me to a psych who didn’t believe in it. I was able to get diagnosed my someone else in their practice so my dr agreed to start me on meds anyway while I waited on the nine month waitlist for a different psych. 

Unfortunately my dr was horrible, required me to come in every month and would cancel my apts with little or no notice and leave me without meds for a week or two. She actually got fired for unrelated things within a few months and the new dr is amazing. He actually listens, gives suggestions about what he thinks we should do with my meds but defers 100% to me if I have something I want to try. Apts every three months, every other apt is telehealth. 

I can also send anyone I want to pick up my meds at the pharmacy if I need to, so if I’m working all week until after they close I can have my bf go in and I don’t have to worry about it. 

I would urge you to move on from any practitioner as soon as you can if they are not providing the care you need. I spent eight years from the time I started seeing professionals until I was diagnosed and I knew I was sticking around with dr’s that weren’t really helping for far too long just bc I couldn’t deal with the process all over again. I was thinking about leaving the dr who prescribed my ADHD meds originally but was afraid I wouldn’t find someone better when she happened to get fired. It’s 1000% worth it to find someone who is actually on your team."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"No kidding. 

It's like some docs think we want:

Insomnia, Sweating, Headaches, intimacy problems, cottonmouth, cramps, digestive distress, high blood pressure, and the stigma of taking meds. All for what?! A drug that doesn't make you feel good, it just makes you feel normal for 8 hours....HALF THE DAY. It's not like the meds even ""cure"" the ADHD. It just makes the coping skills accessible...at least for me.

OP's experience really gets me fuming."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Just guessing but outside a “system” of hospitals etc. Like a physician running their own clinic can make decisions they couldn’t within larger groups that have more specific rules about medicine dosage etc especially re: stimulants
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"In Australia we have a hybrid public/private system. Most doctors work in both systems, some days at a hospital somewhere, some days in their own private practice. I'm not sure how it fits in with your insurance model, so I'll just throw out some details and hope it makes sense.

If I wanted to, I could go through the public system (i.e. hospitals) and pay very little for treatment, however it will take a very long time for things to happen. I've suffered too long to put myself through that, but if I couldn't afford it, I'd definitely be going this route.

The other way, is to have my GP write a referral letter to a specialist, in this case a psychiatrist. I call them up asking for an appointment, send referral etc, and if they decide they want to see me, they'll agree to the appointment. When it comes time to pay, they bill me their full rate. Medicare will automatically pay me back some portion of that, which will be the same as what they would have paid the doctor if I saw them in a hospital, and I pay the difference (called a gap here). My private health insurance doesn't contribute anything at this point, I don't think they pay for doctors, only ""services"" or ""treatments"".  

When I get my scripts filled, the pharmacies refer to them as private scripts, and I also pay full price for them there, but for these my private health insurance does reimburse me some portion of them. 

Does that make sense?

But really, as the other poster mentioned, a doctor typically doesn't care how he gets paid, as long as it is a rate he's happy with. Insurance companies work by offering a fixed rate for a service to doctors, and they accept or not (or have a gap). If you're happy to just pay the whole amount, then everything is easier for *you*, it just costs more."

Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Exactly!! Why would I keep asking if I had found it?!? She (office staff) told me they have ‘100 patients and none had this problem’. Not sure if she meant all the patients or just ADHD patients. I asked if she was insinuating that I was lying.  I told her I was told by all those pharmacies that they didn’t have it! So frustrating.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"It absolutely baffles me how few doctors apparently know how the ADHD brain works. It really shouldn’t surprise them a too-low dosage creates sleepiness. The smaller boost in dopamine helps regulate and effectively slow down our thoughts enough that we can sleep easier, and since we tend not to get awesome sleep at night anyway in my experience that usually means lights out. Sleepiness should be a pretty quick indicator the dose prescribed isn’t providing enough and it needs to be increased. We’re just out here looking to function. 

I don’t think it’s too much to expect that if you’re treating someone with ADHD you research and have at least a basic understanding of how our brains work vs. NTs. Hop on YouTube and watch some Russell Barkley lectures on how our brains work chemically and functionally and medications like so many of us are forced to do because our medical professionals can’t be bothered 😭"
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Well lucky for me my adhd goes into hyper focus when dealing with insurance assholes and I never get off the phone until I talk to a person. What area  of the country are you up in?

But let’s take a look at Canada for example, they have universal healthcare, it is not quick at all and sometimes people in more dire needs are left in the back just because of their place in line. Again I’m in favor of universal healthcare but there needs to be some serious research around how it’s going to work before it’s put into law."

It's so bad the supply issue the rid said told me no one had the Teva brand no one in the area as in rite aid. Aide in the area it was there supplier that was out. Me 😭 another month with the bs gernric brand. I'm too broke to pay for brand name 😭 I need to make money make multiple streams of income to make ting more stable and to be in a better position my in laws are messing with me and putting an already strained and stress situation and ship even worse ironically. It helped. We had a come to Jesus Convo. But  those stressor are still in the gray area and to be avoided to keep the peace. I need to be able to knock my shit out the park and then some. I need my motivation to fight off depression a ND anxiety. Mad bc this version of Adderall suck ass and causes more anxiety then the other one ever would. And I have to take more of it to be effective.   On top of that I have to cut ties with friends for years to make shit work and I'm trying to not think to hard. And now this. It's finally approved and it the wrong generic. I just bit the bullet and took it. I had no choice. It would have delayed everything but at least  3 days to 5 Sunday nothing would be called in just a mess.  My husband has to take some of mine bc he been waiting since April and may. With all this prior auth stuff and we finally like well pay out of pocket for his I have to call Monday to see if they can write a script for him. It'll have to be generic.  I want brand for me.

And he’s always been so easy & supportive & helped me so much with the stigma in my own head that I’ve not wanted to face the challenges I know can come with getting the right provider…do u mind sharing your experience with circle?

Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"To go onto what you are saying, yes you absolutely can do that. My GP does for me, although I both have extensive history with the medication and a cool and understanding doctor.... so not all docs will do this but there are some who will, and if you have been on it a while, all it takes is making an appointment, going to see them and explaining that.... nowadays they can simply look up your prescription records on the computer and see that you were on it no problem. 

For me, as someone who doesn't exactly require ongoing psych visits and such all the time, its an easy and convenient set up to have. I like it much better than seeing a psych tbh."

Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"That’s a valuable insight, I really appreciate your response. Like the other commenter said, you complaint 😎

I don’t want to come across as fangirling/fawning you Americans, but your individualism mindset ie. personal liberty above almost anything and anyone is admirable. Coming from a highly collectivist country (the other extreme end from individualism), everyone was gaslighted since the day he/she was born into this world into thinking you owe the world your life. This seed of manipulation is so deep rooted into our minds that we often fallback to this notion being the centre of attention is bad. 

I believe that the key to live in pursuit of happiness is moderation. Like in my case, I’m complaining because I was hurt, I didn’t do shit, it was wrong, I am matter, hear me out. But you can’t be going down this road of victim mindset forever. Say it once, say it clear, everyone goes home and work on themselves."

Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"I find that it happens most in people with little to no empathy. There's no way to verbalize it so they can understand the inability to ""just do"" something. They can ""just do"" it, so there's no reason you can't.   


The best I've been able to do it was to draw a parallel. I'm pretty tall so I'll usually explain it to people like this; it is as if we went to a grocery store, and I grabbed something from the top shelf, then you tried to get the same thing from the same shelf but couldn't reach it. Then I stand there yelling at you for not reaching it. 

""YOU HAVE HANDS JUST PICK IT UP! WHY SHOULD ANYBODY FEEL SORRY FOR YOU, JUST WRAP YOUR FINGERS AROUND THE THING AND PICK IT UP. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU, YOU HAVE FINGERS, THEY WORK, I WATCH THEM WORK JUST LIKE MINE!!!! PICK IT UP!!!!!""

  
Imagine going through your entire life like that, but add onto that the fact that people with ADHD will hear negative or derogatory things about themselves from parents and teachers more than 200,000 instances more than a typical child before they're 18.  
Now remember, that's just a small part of the social aspect of it. That barely touches on a single portion of a disability that in order to be diagnosed with it, impacts at least 5 parts of a person's life in a significant way."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Same!! A day I forget to take my meds I'm barely able to stand, I'm so drained. If it's a day off I have a hard time staying awake just keep sleeping"
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"This just sounds to me like ""you don't deserve to be fully functioning"". The doctor is such a cunt."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"People without ADHD just don't get it. That's a big part of why it's so hard for us. You're just sitting there, what's so bad about not having your meds? They don't understand what it's like for you not to have control over what you do, for the basic tasks of living to be overwhelming, for your memory to cause daily anxiety and stress."

Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Can't confirm, but it's definitely unprofessional and might breach the duty of care required. Not a lawyer but might be worth getting a consult (med mal typically work on contingency, so no cost up front). OP should have been able to get their prescription history and show their doctor. can't tell whether the doc had OP's history but the follow-up should not have gone like that.

Even if a lawyer won't take the case, OP's insurance would probably love to hear about this. They shouldn't be paying for a second visit in a month if it was more or less ""no care given, problem not addressed. Additional care sought"""

Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,there’s a ton of Psychs who think it isn’t even a real disease still lol that sentiment isn’t shocking at all what is shocking is what she said
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,I've been off my ADHD medcine Adderall 30 XR and 15mg ir afternoon bc of prior authorization issues rasing the 15 mg it to a 30 mg ir.  I just picked it up and even then it wasn't the right generic. I have to use twice as much as this generic version as say the tev version so upset about it but it either that or nothing at all. Something with suck ass side affect versus nothing is better then nothing. Anxiety suck and that pit stomach drop feeling. Is horrid.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,You could also try asking him for a recommendation
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,If a pharmacist is refusing to fill a prescription and unwilling to transfer the script to a different pharmacy you have to contact your doctor to call and talk to them.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"I was already diagnosed. My previous doc was … not a good doc at all. Would show up almost 20 mins late - Chanel purse and coffee in hand. No apologies. She worked out of her husband’s practice but they didn’t share receptionist/front desk …so it was impossible to get a hold of her. She also took two month off every year so it was my job to ration my meds for those two months. 

I can’t even remember how I found circle medical but I’ve been super happy. I “see” the same doc every month and she’s super nice and answers all my questions. It’s way more personal and friendly and I feel comfortable with her. My previous doc - I don’t think she cared. She just wanted my money/business. My circle med Doc makes me feel like she actually cares about me. 

I did have to try and get old records and such from my old doc to my new one, but I don’t think that happened. 

Once I was happy and doing well on meds/dosage I was able to push appts to every other month or every three months. 

If I have an issue between appts I can send a msg through the app. If they need something from me they can also msg me through the app. I get reminders for my appts on my phone. 

It’s seriously been a god send. I hope it’s the same for you. It was too daunting for me to try and find another in network provider and get an appt within a few months. And I didn’t want to go back to my shitty old doc either. I may have lucked out with a good, caring, knowledgeable doc on circle medical who makes me feel
Comfortable. 

I’m billed online and can pay online. 

Rx goes directly to my pharmacy. And when I get a text to let me know it’s ready, I can also pay for it online and then go pick up. So easy. 

I think the ease of it all is so helpful for those with adhd. I always have my phone. I can do my appts from anywhere. I get reminders. 

Just give it a try! if you don’t like who you get. After the appt, msg through the app to say thank you and ask if you could possibly have a diff doc next time because you’re looking for a better fit or someone you’re more comfortable with."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"I just went to my doctor and said ""I used to take ADHD medication when I was in school. I haven't had to be on it in years, but with my new job, I'm doing a lot of repetitive menial data entry and it's a lot like the schoolwork that I had so much trouble with back in my teens. I'd really like to know what changes there have been in ADHD medication- back when I was on it, it was still called ADD- and what works best for adults.""  

He tried to sell me on Vyvanse, but my insurance wouldn't cover it. So he called in a generic adderal prescription for me and we set up a follow-up to talk about it a month later.  

No psychologist appointment needed at all. Same with my depression meds: the first time I saw him, I told him what I'd been on for the last 10+ years and he just called in the prescription after checking that I was doing okay and reminding me that anti-depressants work best in combination with therapy.  

It really blows my mind when I hear these stories about it being difficult to get medication. The most difficulty I've had is getting it covered by my insurance. I had a bit of pushback from my previous GP when getting the anti-depressant prescription. They wanted a script written by a psychologist, but they wrote refill scripts after that. But then again, my state is the worst when it comes to prescription drug abuse. I was given mounds of oxycodone when I had kidney stones. Maybe there's a happy medium somewhere."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,In network should take it very seriously if one of their doctors is behaving like this. They *should* help set up a new appointment. Probably will.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"It looks like maybe I wasn’t clear in how I phrased my comment, because I think we mostly agree with each other. 

I was trying to say that OP’s title matches the severity of what OP experienced. 

I think we might disagree on the frequency of encounters like OP’s though. I hear about stuff like this, in severity and clearly stated bias, often."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Yeah my friend fired that therapist.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,I started the short-acting Adderall. So I take second 4-5 hours after the first. Works better for me than any of the XR type meds. It also allows me to delay or adjust my med schedule to match my needs for the afternoon.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Cool.  Could have used that response for the psychiatrist I met with.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Woah I had no idea the FDA made their own apps!  Interesting, thank you kind sir."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,This kinda resumes how my family treated me when i was a kid. lol.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Great point man. My mental health made leaps of improvement when I tried to stop trying to get people to understand my brain and how it feels. All that matters is that I know how it feels. Doctors and psychs can be wrong they have cognitive biases too. Like OP if they’ve been taking this for 8 years they probably have a good feel for their body at this point they’re not a criminal for that
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Have a coworker that treats me this way. Such ass.

Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"the ones that looked at the salary, and thought they were compassionate.. they either become really good doctors, or when they start throwing ""licenses"" I've found its more of a reprimand that the doctor has received, honestly I found my doctor moving practices changed a lot of my directory, but more sorta comes from what does it look like you will take, all the ""Back Orders"" in the world, and   
""drug shortages"" is not going to make me give a fuck, when I didn't want the medicine.. they shoved it down my throat, now that I can speak for myself.. they have nothing to say other then ""sue"" my doctor.. I'm not trying to sue or fuck anyone over.. but I'm tired of the ""addiction"" taboo.. so what the fuck if I get addicted, I didn't wake up wanting ""my pill"" or a pill.. until I was told by a kindergarten teacher said that's how I should be, it's honestly to the point I'm thinking of finding a class action lawsuit"

Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Do I misunderstand or are the conditions in which it's covered very niche?

Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"For ease of patient records I use wingspan. You can connect to online portals(if they don't have the right one, you can request it. It took about 1 month for one of my Drs portals to get added) and upload records to it. It's free and they send in the release paperwork for you. And you can also request family history to be added, I had my mother fill everything out for those, and I found out health issues that I may need to keep an eye out for in my future.

And I believe you can then use it to share to new Drs so they can get all the history. 

I almost went to a tele health to do my meds, but thankfully my GP is willing to prescribe my ADHD meds(and psych meds, as I request them, as I know meds and my body very well) as I am very wary of psychologists as my last had me over prescribed on 13 meds and refused to let me taper down on any of them, even after getting gastorpraisis as a side effect.

She will even do refills and adjustments through messages so I don't have to go to the office every month, or pay for an appointment every time I need to adjust my meds. Which is amazing to not have to call each month, and just send a message to get my refills."

This helps my brain to be able to take the steps tremendously. You have no idea. 

Well, you probably do 😂

Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Well you have to remember it's not always easy for everyone to get on, back on it, whatever. Some people don't have the benefit of having been on it before, like for me I've been on it for a few years now again, with a break of a few years since the last I was on it and my doctor was able to look on the prescription database, see I had been prescribed it before and that I had a diagnosis so there really wasn't much he needed to do beyond that as far as testing or anything else.... but a lot of people don't have that history with it. Also there are doctors that are totally hostile towards anybody taking this type of medication and subscribe to the old ""you just need to try harder"" way of thinking. 

Point is, it's not easy or possible for everyone and we are both lucky that we've had a relatively easy time with our docs. Also, having been through this before, we know what to say, how to act, etc that others don't have the benefit of. You are right tho, it should be a happy medium, and that certainly exists somewhere, because not every single person has this disorder, and not every single person needs medication, but there are plenty out there going totally unmedicated and without assistance dealing with it... neither should be true statements in an ideal world."

Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"HELLA RANT WARNING! Read if you want :   


oh trust me, I've been on it as much as possible, unfortunately have no patience to look for it anymore here in so flo, so I'm either gone try to find a way that it gets absorbed, or get some IR's good luck to you, don't feel bad try to see it from everyone's point of view, not all of us are nice like you and let shit slide, so I'm sure majority of a doctors day is spent weighing the pro/can of medicines that said psychiatrists are really overworked, especially if they aren't POYOP (pay out your own pocket) some can range as much as a lawyer, I've seen them with no added compassion, but in no way shape or form do you deserve this treatment, especially when you have to basically beg a pharmacists to fill them now as well I found down here you have to call and ask them, so sometimes it's better to just get it sent in, without asking any questions (sad we have to go without before we can go with) , I quit my last pharmacy, despite them being able to fill my brands cause I worked up enough courage to ask my doctor for an early fill on my clonazepam so I could move back home, get sleep and not worry about meds that I'd need filled as soon as I got back.

Which made us both look like a fool when the pharmacists says they aren't filling it period, no matter what the doctor says.. in my opinion most doctors are simply the ones that hand golden tickets out, but you still gotta ask willy wonka to come in.. 

&#x200B;

 I got scripts rejected for the dosing schedule, wanting to get up at like 5 am, and take 3 doses.. I've been on this since a kid, day in day out.. 20mg X 3 was still in FDA dosing guidelines, but they said it had to be 2 times a day only.. my doctor called back with 1 1/2 20 mg x 2 cause everything is ""back ordered"" they finally just try to aggravate the situation by quoting fine amounts from the DEA, all while having their children dispense the medications.. none of us asked to be on this medicine, in the first place.. I came back to it after a break and asked, cause I feel fucked without it.. but speaking from both angles, if you can help it.. try not to even get on this ride, cause motivation will never improve by consistently blasting dopamine.. even when I got a brand script now.. there's nothing therapeutic .. also never take a doctors judgments personally, there are amazing ones out there, and then the ones who did career day at highschool and only looked at the paycheck when deciding, keep searching you'll know you found it, when you feel like bursting out into tears cause its the first doctor that made you feel like you got this thing we call life subsequently, I've went from needing more meds.. to less

It's in my own opinion that this won't get resolved until FDA/DEA sees funding slashed cause everyone's unfocused with hurt backs.. I can't recommend anything to you on here, but there's a lot of things you can do until you find things out.. never fill hopeless.."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Yup. not LOL.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"Same, except I started adderall at 25. Chronic exhaustion, “laziness”, extreme depression. Turns out I’m not severely depressed when I’m medicated because the root of the depression was that I couldn’t force myself to keep up with everyone else and was dealing with extreme burnout from doing minimal tasks. I’m 27 now and while I’m not *thriving*, my life is leaps and bounds better than it was and it’s thanks to adderall. Without medication I don’t know where I’d be right now"
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Exact same thing except I was 30 before it became so bad that I had to figure the root cause.
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Everybody who applies for disability in the US has to jump through serious hoops to prove that they are disabled.

Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Someone else mentioned that her other patients clearly just accept whatever they get from her because they don’t actually have adhd fr so she’s thinking OP wanting to tweak the dose at all must mean he’s just trying to score when in reality its the opposite.

Turns out I've got a lot of joint damage from hypermobility and a congenital cyst on my hyoid bone in my neck that I'll need surgery for.

Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"I think he could definitely have a case but I actually spoke to a lawyer once about a doctor who neglected a family member and I was told that although I might have a decent case, if I was to lose I would obviously have to pay for the lawyer but the doctor could also counter sue for all of the costs associated with going to court. I ended up reporting the doctor to the governing body, which will result in no monetary award but I am hoping will result in change that prevents another patient from being harmed."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,Do you know if the pt ended up being charged for care/ appointments? Was it covered by insurance?
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"No I absolutely get that. I have chronic issues with nausea and I’ve done every test under the sun, except absolutely nothing has come back as conclusive. No doctor knows *why* I suffer from as bad of nausea issues as I do. I’ve done food studies, allergy tests, full colonoscopy/endoscopy, they even went as far as to inject me with radiation and stick me in a machine for four hours and watch as the radiation moved through my gallbladder/stomach/intestines (i guess it lights your organs up so they can see them better?) and nothing…. I’m not sure if mine is caused by ADHD and I’m not claiming it is, but every doctor has come back as nothings wrong with me so I *must* be faking it. It makes dealing with they symptoms of ADHD *much* harder. Not to mention I’m also autistic so I have all those struggles as well. Being medicated for ADHD makes it all easier to bear because at least *one* of my issues has been addressed."

Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"I find it interesting that I happened to make a school project on this a few weeks ago (it wasn't specifically about Reagan, just the decade he was president in, but still).

He fucked over the economy (it looked like it was ""growing,"" but it was only making the divide between the middle class and upper class significantly larger), he fucked over a ton of environmental policies despite it being universally accepted that the ozone layer was definitely depleting, he started another wave of cold war paranoia long after it should have died, etc etc

I didn't even look too hard, this was just a surface level reading of his era (since again, the project was on the decade in general, so I was more into researching the challenger disaster than Reagan's bullcrap lol). I'm sure it was probably even worse than I found."
Treated like a criminal for needing ADHD medication,"It harmed the whole world, because the US being the first economic power at the time, everything that happened there impacted on the global economy.

Day one of Dexedrine - unsure if I should continue,"I'm not a medical professional. But I do discourage you from giving up too early on ADHD medication.

We all have different experiences on medication. But personally, I felt side effects on Concerta on the first couple of days. On day 3 or 4, it went away completely.

I also noticed that everytime I increased my dosage, those side effects came back. But only after 1 day, they disappeared.

Another big factor for me was sleep. Concerta worked wonders for me, but I couldn't sleep for shit. This was extremely frustrating to me since it worked so well otherwise, but you simply can't sacrifice sleep.

My schedule changed, and suddenly I had to wake up very early, so I started taking my Concerta at 06-07am. At the same time, my insomnia completely disappeared. 

Turns out that the problem was that I took my Concerta way too late. Nowadays, I have an alarm set up at 7am. I take my meds, and I go back to sleep. If I take my meds any later than 8-9am, I can't sleep for shit.

All of this being said, my advice for you is to be more patient with medications. If it's been two weeks and you feel nothing but negative effects, there's no reason to continue. But 2 days is definitely too little to give medications a fair chance, unless you're experiencing dangerous side effects like dangerously increased heart rate."

"Motivated but not focused, tried adderall, dexedrine, Wellbutrin, now concerta ","I find that concerta allows you to emotionally regulate super well, but it gives you weaponized hyperfixation. You put your mind to anything and you'll be able to stay on it. 

Anxiety is super bad with Concerta, so i'd try to pair it with an anti anxiety med that works in tangent with Concerta (I used hydroxyzine HCl)"
"Motivated but not focused, tried adderall, dexedrine, Wellbutrin, now concerta ","For the concentration, try doing exercise or changing diet(gluten and general intolerances known to cause issues concentration/brain fog)

For the other issues, ye thats just be how it is, you need to decide if in the end its worth the side effects or not. For dry mouth, try chewing sugar free gum, I was spent like 60 euro a month on it at one point.

For anxiety issues try finding something that might counter the anxiety issues, can just be learning CBT or breathing exercises to learn to handle it a bit better too, doesn;'t need to be meds or whatever."

Awful dry mouth on generic dexedrine!! Anyone prefer Adderall over Dexedrine/dextroamphetamine?,"Just talk to your prescriber about it.   There are also options out there to help deal with the dry mouth from over the counter lozenges and rinses to prescription pills.

I have a disorder that also causes really bad dry mouth so I know how miserable it can be"

Positive experiences with (generic) Dexedrine? ,"I've had a similar experience with generic Dexedrine. It didn't boost my focus much either, but I did notice improvements in mood and anxiety. Switching to brand-name Dexedrine might be worth a shot if the generics aren't working for you."
Positive experiences with (generic) Dexedrine? ,"I'm not near my car so I can't read the bottle but I'm pretty sure I had generic dex for a couple months, I just don't know the manufacturer off the top of my head. CVS was out of Adderall so they changed my script to dex. It didn't help my focus the way that Adderall by Sandoz does (so far that has been the best for me) but I've also had some other generic Adderalls that didn't do that much for focus either. Dex helped my anxiety which for me is fucking huge. I have had episodes of cptsd  where I puked so much I destroyed my esophagus (I need surgery because of it. ) So for me,  it helps about as much as a mid grade Adderall but not as well as Sandoz or Teva. But it still helped with focusing some,  it was more subtle,  but it helped."
Positive experiences with (generic) Dexedrine? ,Did u ever try brand-name Dexedrine?
Positive experiences with (generic) Dexedrine? ,"After reading some other subreddits, you appear to not be the only one with a better experience with Adderall than with Dexedrine (at least when it comes to concentration). If only the European Union would make Adderall legal so that I can see for myself 🙃"
Positive experiences with (generic) Dexedrine? ,"It depends on the Adderall manufacturer. Teva, and Sandoz yes. Northstar is fairly similar,  Northstar is a little more speedy, for lack of a better term.  And Northstar, what I currently have,  does help my concentration a bit better than dex, but initially i was taking halves 3 hours apart because it was so speedy. But the other Adderalls I've had were less helpful than dex. 

Yeah,  that's a drag.  I wonder why dex is ok but Adderall isn't,  seems strange. 

I hope you get your shit figured out a bit. The concentration wasn't a life changer for me but it's really nice and with it comes a sense of peace i only get around 4am, when the rest of the world is asleep, without it. But decades of anxiety being gone, that was like a fucking miracle, my atheist ass almost thanked god it was so amazing🤪🤣"
Positive experiences with (generic) Dexedrine? ,"I’m not quite sure.. I’ve heard that levo-amphetamine (which is absent in Dexedrine) makes Adderall more addictive and anxiety-inducing, and therefore, the EU prohibits it..

I guess I’m too focus-oriented after Ritalin helping me massively on that part since I was 7 (I’m 25 now).. But the latter isn’t everything as well because it makes me overfocus a lot, it induces my overall anxiety, and it causes real depressive feelings.. Heard that Focalin might be a good alternative, but, of course, the latter is also unavailable in Europe haha"

Switching from XR 15mg to Dexedrine 10mg,Hey is actually read before that the decks drain is 20 times or can be up to 20 times stronger than Adderall I don't know if you agree with that but I know that it changed someone's life that I know that used to really abuse his Adderall it was actually the dexedrine spansule 15mg! When I have red research about it and I am prescribed it after my Adderall XR so that it lasts longer! Many of the medical post about it say that it's a lot smoother and doesn't cause anxiety as often as taxidrine or I mean the Adderall sorry

Generic Dexedrine IR vs ER,"I'd be interested to know how the switch back turned out for you. ER versions of these medicines have a different formulation and may include some ingredients that are interacting uniquely with your body or causing too slow/fast of a release - people report anxiety from too high and too low doses of stimulants, so it could be any number of things.

Have you tried Vyvanse (or generic)? If so, how does it compare to the Dexedrine IR?"
Generic Dexedrine IR vs ER,"No I haven't tried the generic for Vyvanse or the brand. This medication is the first I have tried after getting diagnosed in December at age 41. The generic hasn't been out long but when I first got prescribed in February it seemed like the generic Vyvanse was out of stock and back ordered everywhere and I didn't want to deal with supply issues so we went with dextroamphetamine which I have no trouble getting. I would love to try generic Vyvanse though as I heard it does work so well for many people. 

Switching back to the IR has been ok, the extremely high anxiety has abated. I took a 2 day break from stimulants to get it out of my system and I slept so well the past couple of nights. I'll try the ER again to see if the same thing happens that way I can know for sure. I couldn't really tell when it was leaving out of my system, compared to the IR, and I did like not having to dose twice a day. I think I may metabolize it pretty quickly as I have fast COMT."
Generic Dexedrine IR vs ER,"Now obviously don't take medicine advice from people on reddit but it is very common for people on stimulants to have an ER dose in the morning as well as an IR booster later in the day. If you ever tried that and did not feel similar levels of anxiety compared to just ER, you might come to the conclusion that the slow release (ER) dosage is too low. If your anxiety goes through the roof and you get a bunch of side effects, it may be the case that you are more receptive to the drug than average and you may need a lower dose.

  
Also, consider asking your doc about other sedative drugs that counteract the stimulant anxiety. I know many people take Guanfacine, for example. Best of luck, it's a journey"

Where’s my high dose people at?,"I was on 60mg Ritalin in the morning with another 20mg after lunch to get me through to when I got home after work. I’m now on 60mg Vyvanse. No rage at low doses for me, just no functioning/ adulting 🤦🏼‍♀️"
Where’s my high dose people at?,"72mg concerta + 65mg strattera combi therapy here (and the strattera is still being titrated up a month at a time so not sure where it’ll top out yet).

Add to this my mental health med cocktail and my vitamins, and I have one of those 7-day AM/PM pill cases that looks like I’m a 90yr old in palliative care 😂"
Where’s my high dose people at?,50 mg Adderall XR in the morning and 30 mg XR at noon. Sometimes 60 mg in the morning.
Where’s my high dose people at?,70mg vyvanse here. Considering trying another medication as it isn’t as effective as I’d like it to be. It definitely helps - I feel a big difference on days when I don’t take it. No side effects except for the occasional afternoon headache if I’ve had a big day.
Where’s my high dose people at?,"Was on 30mg Adderall XR and it gave me horrible mouth sores, brain zaps, and was extremely shaky. Just switched to Vyvanse 50mg 3 days ago and I feel like if I went higher I might get panic attacks. But all my adhd symptoms aren’t fully addressed. I’m gonna keep taking it and hope for the best 🙏 my doctor was also talking about maybe trying Concerta.."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"With what 20mg does to me, I cannot fathom what even 30mg, yet alone 60mg would do."
Where’s my high dose people at?,I’m on 70mg of Ritalin a day…60XR then 10IR in the afternoons.
Where’s my high dose people at?,"70 mg Vyvanse. Previously 60 mg with 20mg Adderall in the afternoon. This plus 150 mg Wellbutrin. This much of a stimulant dose means my aerobic max is lower. For the same effort, my heart rate is higher, so I can't reach the same levels of aerobic output as if I wasn't medicated. I have a pretty old-school conservative primary care doctor. He's got me on beta blockers. He is normally wary of stimulants (but will readily admit it's not his area of practice), but he's said that he thinks I should stay on my high dose stimulant with beta blockers because my quality of life is higher than if I were to go off both. He thinks this is worth the small risk of simulant therapy. Plus there are several heart function tests he runs every year at my physical that should let me know if I start having issues from the stimulants. 

My dose is increasing because of life responsibilities, not necessarily decreased effectiveness of the medication. I used to work 8-4 and have the afternoon to myself. Then 8-4 and watch kids while my wife got a break. Then 7-3 so I could get home in time to help one kid with homework. Then my wife decided to finish her degree, so I work 6-2:30, cook dinner, help *two* kids with homework, and if there's anything left over, work on a side project or two. But typically I'm doing laundry or scheduling the next day right up until bedtime. 

Unfortunately, ADHD has a strong hereditary component (I know I have an unusual mutation on one of my D2 receptors associated with schizophrenia, depression, dementia, Parkinson's disease, etc). So one of my kids struggles with executive function. This makes more work for me to help keep her on task. I can't be her external scheduler or she'll never learn, but I also don't want her falling behind. Crawling out after falling behind is really difficult with ADHD. It's too easy to get discouraged."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I am 54 mg Concerta in the morning and 18 mg after lunch when I remember to take it to.

I have only been medicated since March and have begun to not like how I feel when the medicine wears off. Not sure how I made it this far in my life without it and yet my mind kicks me for taking the medicine.

A viscous circle"
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I take Adderall, but a SUPER XR Variant that lasts 16 hours for the halftime, I did just start this one opposed to a 25 mg normal XR. Currently on the weirdly specific dosage 37.5 mg."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I take 100mg of Vyvanse (brand only) as my main medicine.  I also take 100mg of Strattera, 300mg of Wellbutrin XL, & 25mg of Elavil (originally for migraines) which all help some. Then I have 30mg Adderall to use in the evening if I need & 0.1-0.2mg of Clonidine for panic attacks as needed (deadlines & time limits really stress me out).

A long time ago I had to take 15mg of Adderall every 45 minutes (6 times a day).  That didn't last long.  Then I took 30mg of Adderall XR two times a day.  I almost always forgot the second dose & it didn't last all that long anyway."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I'm on 60mg Ritalin SR daily and can top up with 10mg IR if I need to 

Without it I'm a angry sobbing mess for a few days but then level out to just having severe ADHD symptoms after that like I was sans medication"
Where’s my high dose people at?,"70mg Vyvanse here, been loving it. I used to take 30mg of Adderall but I didn't like how it went from 0 to 100 in such a short time. 

Vyvanse has worked great for me and I honestly haven't hit a plateau with the strength, duration, or focus."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"It doesn’t seem high dose compared to these lol but my doc referred to me as his “high dose” patient a few months ago, 40mg daily"
Where’s my high dose people at?,I generally do 60mg Adderall IR a day and sometimes I need another 20 to finish the day or go to sleep and I take the weekend off.  The 60mg per day limit feels arbitrary and should be excused for special cases.  
Where’s my high dose people at?,"Was on 30 mg vyvanse now first day on 40.
I’m not able to study and work the same day . After the halftime I start to forget things and act carelessly. I get home from work and I can’t study. Reading the same line like 8 times.
So I’m probably not gonna stop at 40 mg."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"70mg Vyvanse barely worked..20 mg (I think time release?) Adderall barely worked.

Without it I am a shell of a human who cannot fulfill responsibilities or appointments.... Chores... Self-care. (I don't work for other reasons, but without it I barely made it to work, was a snail with either no focus or it took gargantuan effort to begin on work, was always demoralized, hating myself, taking no joy from any type of work (working with animals, kids, on planes... F customers. But no joy there either)

I give up."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"70mg vyvanse in the AM, 20mg adderall IR around 2 pm. Doesn't completely negate my symptoms but it helps me do what I need to do. 

When i dont take it, all I feel like I can do is eat and sleep. Zero functionality, unless I'm doing something extremely engaging, and even then, I feel like I'm trying to move through jello."

Where’s my high dose people at?,30 mg dexadrine IR 3x a day. My body just metabolizes it really fast.
Where’s my high dose people at?,30mg adderall XR twice a day
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I thought 60 was the highest FDA approved dose? How are people prescribed 60 if it's not approved? Maybe the FDA approved one level and some insurance companies put their own lower limits on it? 
 
Several years ago, I did GeneSight testing. It was marketed like it would tell you what med you need for a bunch of different issues, like depression, anxiety, ADHD, chronic pain, etc. In reality, it just analyzed your genetics and told you how fast you would metabolize a standard dose of a huge list of meds. So it wouldn't tell you which med would actually help your symptoms, but it would tell you whether a med's effects would last longer or shorter than average. 

Dosing recommendations are based on averages, but for any given med, you may process it much faster or shorter than average. So if the bottle says ""take one every 6 hours,"" it may wear off after 3 hours for some people or last 8 hours for other people. Obviously, that can be rough if you go by the label instead of by your body. You end up with gaps and crashes, or you end up with a higher level in your system than you need because your doses are overlapping. 

I don't really recommend genesight testing. But I could see how it might be useful for anyone who is arguing with a doctor over wanting an extra dose each day. Your body can give you the info without the test, but doctors and insurance companies seem to want a computer and some graphing involved before anything can be ""true."" Maybe there are other tests out there now, or maybe genesight offers more info in the results now too. It's been about 7 years since I took it, and things evolve."
Where’s my high dose people at?,I'm prescribed 60mg of ritalin but I'm trying to get it down to 40. I just function better on a higher dose but I have other health issues that make me nervous to be on a high dose long term.

Where’s my high dose people at?,"I take 60mg ritalin a day and have been taking it for about 2 years now. At first 10mg gave me intense euphoria and focus, would drench me in sweat and give me palpitations. now 20mg feels as effective as smelling the pill. This is awful and don’t try it but I recently took 200+mg on a particularly busy and stressful day, lost count. Didn’t even sweat. Hoping I can switch to adderall and restart. Does anyone know if ritalin tolerance carries over to adderall?"
Where’s my high dose people at?,50 mg Vyvanse in the morning with a 10-20 mg adderall booster in the afternoon. Was previously on 70 mg with no booster and just found that my crashes were awfulllll.

Where’s my high dose people at?,"70 vyvanse with 10 vyvanse topper in the afternoon.  And 20 mg IR.  Why? Because in 10 years, this has been the only combination that has helped. 

When I don’t take it?  Depends on how long.  I can get away with a 60% dose, but I am much less productive and much more scattered."
Where’s my high dose people at?,I’m on 50 mg Vyvanse currently with a 10 mg adderall booster. Will likely see about an increase at next appt as that’s only lasting me until about 12-1 (I take it at 5:15). I’m definitely going to ask for a different short acting booster because the adderall vs Vyvanse is a night and day difference. Was previously on 50 mg IR adderall (20+20+10) before I made the switch to vyvanse.
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I’m on 40mg Equasym at the moment (long release methylphenidate), but I have to say I’m not a fan. For some reason, I feel like short release ritalin works better for me in terms of focus and executive dysfunction.   
Also, when it dips, I stumble over my words and get clumsy which is not exactly ideal when I’m at work (it’s a new job, I don’t really want to look like an idiot in front of my new coworkers)."
Where’s my high dose people at?,75mg vyvanse … things don’t stay clean if I don’t take a full dose
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I'm taking 80mg Strattera. My doctor kept raising it because I felt the lower does weren't helping. Even 80mg still isn't doing much.


I still lose focus and get stuck in my own head, but not as badly as when I am not on my meds."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I did my absolute best when I experimented with 60 mg Vyvanse twice a day. My doctor agreed, but we couldn’t find a local pharmacy that would fill it. (I’ve already had multiple debates with them regarding the FDA guidelines, and to some degree, I understand their reasoning from their perspective). I currently take 20 mg Adderall IR three times a day. There’s definitely a good argument to be made that those doses are way too high. I know most providers wouldn’t support it. All I do know for sure is that: I’m finally getting my life together for the first time in a long time. Whenever I try to stick to the dosage of the prescribing guidelines, and I absolutely have tried, my life falls to shit. I’m hoping that there comes a time when I can cut back, but it’s been working out for about 6 months. I believe that I might have a genetic disposition of processing stimulants really fast. However, I have never been able to have it tested."
Where’s my high dose people at?,72 mg Concerta here with ritalin booster to take at 4 pm
Where’s my high dose people at?,"First time posting here. 

I started at 10mg with Adderall and requested to do 5mg but with the option of being able to take another 5mg for the rest half of the day. 

Sometimes, I feel like 5mg doesn't do the job, but when I take the 10mg, there are mostly times when I get frustrated easily and then irritated. If I have expectations of how conversations go, I get frustrated at myself for not being able to guide certain conversations toward a great discussion. 

You're not alone, I got clumsy and somewhat disoriented that day because it was just like a downfall of things that kept happening and you keep drilling yourself. I'm going to bring it up to my psychiatrist next we meet."
Where’s my high dose people at?,I had a coworker who was taking 30mgs 3x a day
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I am on 80mg of Vyvanse daily.

A few years ago, I used to be on 108mg of Concerta and i was very very happy with that, until there was a licensing issue between Janssen (just distributer, not the manufacturer) and all of German insurance. 

I tried Ritalin Adult then, and I hated it immediately. I hated it so much I stopped taking ADHD meds for 2 years. Ritalin made me feel extremely aggressive and nervous all the time, even though I was on a much lower dose because of switching medications. 

I feel that I could go on an _even higher_ dose of Vyvanse to improve the feeling of productivity and motivation and the reduction of executive dysfunction without feeling like I am tense or wound up."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I took 80mg of Adderall XR daily for like 8 years. This past year my psych randomly decided we needed to go down to 60mg, so that’s where I’m at now. I miss my old dose, but I also recognize that 80mg a day is a lot, so I’m getting by with 60 for now."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I'm on 70mg Vyvanse, without it my proprioception is a mess (it was before I started meds) and I'd be at risk of falling asleep during work meetings.

I had good effect at 40mg, but it only lasted about 3 hours. So my psych was like let's keep titrating up and see if it lasts longer, and It did, each step up lasted a bit longer. 70mg lasts me most of my day. I gotta be extra careful in the late evenings tho as I return to my pumpkin form and a big clutz."
Where’s my high dose people at?,60 mg Vyvanse it won’t last long enough in the day at lower doses
Where’s my high dose people at?,60mg Vyvanse twice a day. I always wait for people to do a double take.
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I’ve been prescribed 20mg of Ritalin 5 times a day (100mg/day) for over 10 years. Initially, it was 7 times a day, but due to my health insurance company changing, my doctor had to go back and forth with the insurance company to cover more than 3/day; the insurance company “allowed” 5/day. I also used to have 80mg of Strattera on top of that.   I was prescribed last week, on top of my Ritalin, 1mg of Intuniv (Guanfacine) nightly. (I’m taking a quick 5-week course to take and pass the Series 65- so I called my Doc and asked if there was anything else available that could add to and help me focus better during this class- b/c it is dry AF and the classes are 3.5 hours long; and, as we ADHD’ers know, having to sit, focus, and actually retain the information being thrown at us for that long, is practically impossible).      With all that nonsense and TMI, I’ve found that I can go a day or more without taking any Ritalin, without experiencing any noticeable side effects.  I only feel the need for it when I must concentrate on something. Interestingly, Adderall is my go-to for intense focus, but unfortunately, Adderall cannot be prescribed in the same method as Ritalin."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I’m on the exact same dosage as you are. My doctor gave me the option of deciding whether to take 20mg twice a day or just take the whole 40mg at once in which I do that because it has a lot less impact on my ability to fall asleep. I’ve been on Adderall so long that I can take 40mg and fall asleep if I’m not busy that day!!!

I’m not sure but I believe that 40mg IR is the maximum therapeutic dose for IR Adderall and XR can go up to 60mg. I think it’s not a rule but more of a clinical thing that says 40mg is recommended to be the maximum dose for Adderall IR. However doctors still have the ability to prescribe more if they want but if it’s done for more than a few clients it would probably grab the attention of the DEA and would inquire as to why they are prescribing such high dosages.

A piece of great advice for newbies on Adderall or even people who have been on it for years is that if you want to experience the absolute best effects with minimal side effects is STAY HYDRATED!!!! If you drink plenty of water regardless of what you are doing you will feel so incredibly good that it’s almost like how alcohol intensifies benzos. Not the best comparison but water is amphetamines best friend and I try to drink around 100oz a day or if working and sweating I’ll increase to around 120-140oz and that’s compared to the recommended amount of 80oz per day.

Also, especially for new people on Adderall who completely lose their appetite I’d recommend forcing yourself to eat something light and healthy like a salad or a couple of pieces of fruit no matter if you force yourself.

These simple but often overlooked things can cause you to feel so much better which in actuality just curbs the side effects from dehydration which amphetamines do to your body. These drugs can be extremely beneficial to people who truly need them and can be extremely dangerous for both people who need them and people who don’t because if you don’t need Adderall the side effects of euphoria can be extremely intoxicating and addictive because they make you feel invincible and energetic.

I’m 39yrs old male who’s been on Adderall off and on since around 13 and I’ve been prescribed and taking it for 10 years straight and can honestly say that the benefits outweigh the side effects. People who are just starting meds like these sometimes think they are a magic bullet and just taking them is enough to fix their problems but the truth is they have to be taken with extreme caution and knowledge. If not they are risking becoming addicted because although I’m of the opinion that I feel better on my off days (my doctor said I can take an off day 1-2 days a week if I’m off work) but I’ve heard of people who don’t take it so they don’t build a tolerance.

That kind of thinking is a prelude of addiction because if you’re skipping doses so that when you do take it you experience a level of euphoria that is addictive behavior. While it’s okay to take an off day that should be run by your prescribing doctor and not just because you want to feel like the first time you took it. You need a tolerance because that’s when amphetamines are the most effective because even if you’re still experiencing a certain amount of euphoria in the peak of the effects tolerance should eventually become when you have the benefits of the meds without a euphoric feeling."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I'm taking 30mg Adderall xr twice a day. I'm not sure it's enough. Or it might be too much. Or maybe I need to take more breaks. I can't seem to get through a day without it, but it's not doing enough either. Ugh"
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I'm on 30xr Adderall 2x a day. I mostly take it the way I'm supposed to, with the occasional ""I have something important that takes a little more concentration/more energy"" in the late afternoon. As long as I take it before 3pm I have no trouble getting to sleep before 10pm. I'll buy a few to make up for the ones I take. As far as how I feel when I don't take it? Worthless. I can't think, I'm exhausted, and really short tempered."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"72mg per day and struggling.  Methylphenidate.

Honestly I feel half the battle is having to live in a world where our eccentricities aren't tolerated or can't be expressed freely so it destroys us inside.  

Fkn brutal.

I wanna make noise and just be a ball of lightning but how 🤣. I'm 44 and it's just fkn weird."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"Is 40mg really the limit? I was prescribed 15mg IR 3x a day (so 45mg daily) and my doctor didn’t even say anything? For reference I was 5’3 and 130lbs if it makes a difference. That was last year, I’m on 10mg of adderal extended release now and I feel a lot better."

Where’s my high dose people at?,Seriously ? I was on 60! I had idea that wasn't FDA approved.
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I'm on 40mg xr on the mornings and 20mg ir in the afternoons. I've been on this for a bit and found it's the only thing that can get me through the day. I used to have issues sleeping if I took my ir too late but I have trazodone for that now, should I need it."
Where’s my high dose people at?,I’m at 40mg per day & that’s just what ended up working for me. Lower doses just wore off extremely quick & I would crash
Where’s my high dose people at?,It sounds like you’d do well on a stronger dose. What’s approved by the fda is just the standard they use. There are many people that require more than 40mg/day.  I do for example. I’d never have a therapeutic dose if I took a max of 40mg of IR. Doctors than genuinely treat adult adhd and don’t just say they do (far too many do). It’s difficult to find really specialized psychiatrists that know the complexity of adult adhd (even for children). I’m in the same position now except I ran into difficult times and haven’t had a doctor for this in a few years. Getting treated like you’re doing something wrong asking for medication with a controlled status. There’s nothing wrong with being given medication to treat a disorder(s). Internet search places like the hallowell ctr. They definitely are familiar with h the ins and outs of ADHD.

Where’s my high dose people at?,"I take 30mg adderall instant release daily split over 2-3 doses depending on how the day is going. Sometimes 20 in the am and 10 at noon, sometimes 10 in the am and 20 at noon. Occasionally, I'll do three of 10--am, noon, and around 2pm. I've been on meds for over 20 years, so my Dr gives me some leeway with dosing my 30mgs."
Where’s my high dose people at?,Right here!
Where’s my high dose people at?,i’m on 40mg of vyvanse but still being titrated. probably will need to go up to 50 or 60mg
Where’s my high dose people at?,60 MG Adderall xr an d a 40mg Vyvanse in afternoon
Where’s my high dose people at?,70 mg. Might try lower dose and have the other 20 as a booster if possible. Working really well but only 6-7 hours only
Where’s my high dose people at?,72mg Concerta or equivalent because the UK is still having supply issues and it’s the Bain of my life.
Where’s my high dose people at?,"54mg concerta but I dont take it every day. When I do take it I must eat a good breakfast. I find I can take a coffee during breakfast too. Because I WILL skip lunch. And I'll eat dinner.

Where’s my high dose people at?,"I did try concerts but I couldn’t sleep. I’ve been on vyvanse 50mg for a few years now, I believe the max dose for vyvanse is 70mg.

The 50mg works pretty well for me, honestly I probably could use a higher dose. However, given the current dose I have a rapid heart beat all the time, even if I drink decaf coffee it makes it significantly worse. But I don’t have any trouble sleeping, even if I were to take it at 12pm, I would still be able to sleep fine at night at a reasonable time."

Will probably be adding a booster in the near future. I also have the option of going on 25mg XR + 10mg IR twice a day. Primarily afraid of never being able to get the scripts filled for that protocol!"
Where’s my high dose people at?,"Idk if my dose is particularly high because I’m on kind of a weird med so idk how the dose compares to others. I do a 14.5mg xelstrym patch in the morning and 5mg adderall IR around 12-1 and another 5mg a couple hours later. The xelstrym patch works great on its own for like 8 hours. If I skip the adderall I’m just super tired by like 3pm, I feel like I need to nap and can’t concentrate.

If it’s a light day and I don’t have a ton of stuff to do in the evening I’ll just take one 5mg adderall just so I don’t get so sleepy in the afternoon but I take a total of 10mg most days. It helps me be able to finish out the day, maybe have a little executive function to work on some homework before bed and actually helps me fall asleep easier surprisingly."

Not that that matters but I have noticed I lost a bit of weight when I dose went up. Was on 40 like you and it literally felt like it just stopped working so my dr upped me to 30 twice a day. But now I feel like the high dose does nothing still, besides make me depressed and stuck on my couch idk if it's the meda or the stress I have going on with my life but it's strange that it's all started when my dose changed."

Where’s my high dose people at?,I used to be on 90 mg IR adderall. For years. For the last year I’ve been on 75 mg because it’s a new doctor and they lowered.

Where’s my high dose people at?,I'm surprised by the number of people on Adderall vs. Concerta. I was expecting more of an even split. I'm on 54 mg Concerta but dropping to 36 because it's making me emotionally blunted and aggressive.

I had been on either 10 or 5mg adderall at the start but it gave me bad chest pains (thankfully no cardiac event was detected) hence the switch. Not sure how it is for those that are on the high range for adderall but on straterra I feel fine. I get a slight fuzzy/tingling sensation in my head when it kicks in (about 1.5 hrs after taking it) and it makes it so much easier to get started on my work and I'm not as drawn to distractions or veering way from the task at hand. So far the main side effects I experience are dry mouth a few hours in, severe nausea unless I eat prior to taking it, minor bm delays, and occasional ED. Not sure if I'm not sleeping as well since I have crap sleeping habits to begin with. 

If I forget to take it, I feel fine but the difference in my ability to focus and filter out distractions is much more noticeable."

Where’s my high dose people at?,"Just recently upped to 60mg Adderall XR. I take it first thing when I wake up. My provider is surprised that my BP (95/65) and resting heart rate(59 bpm)have remained low. I told them it's always been like that, but I have also always been physically active-- weights 3-4 days a week, plus yoga, and pickleball for 2 hrs twice a week. I have tons, and I mean tons of excess energy, so on the days I don't take it, I need to exercise or work on a project. If not, I find myself getting restless and irritable. 

On a side not though I did have to stop drinking coffee. It absolutely fucks with my mood. Over the last 6 months I'd literally been waking up feeling irritated for no reason at all. I'd be unreasonalbly annoyed at things that I wouldn't normally be, like my dog taking a poop like they always do, and be overestimulated super easily the whole day. My partner mentioned coffee, so I stopped cold turkey. What do you know completely back to my usual happy self in 24hrs. I will never drink coffee again."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"Currently on Adderall IR 60mg a day (30mg 2x a day).

It works just okay. I miss my previous dose of IR 15mg 3x a day because I hate breaking a tablet in half and maybe it’s just me but I don’t think breaking the tablet in half is as effective as taking a whole 15mg IR tablet. I know mathematically it’s the same but I prefer whole tablets because I usually lose the other halve and have to break another tablet. It’s a pain to keep track of.

Also for whatever reason my insurance no longer covers 90 pills without prior authorization. I asked my doc if we can change it but he doesn’t want to since Adderall is already hard to find and doesn’t think the pharmacy would fill it.

I see where my doc is coming from and in many ways I agree but holy shit I miss my old dose. Also taking a tablet twice a day doesn’t give me enough coverage throughout the day which absolutely sucks."
Where’s my high dose people at?,20mg IR 3x a day. Max dose dr will prescribe. I could take 80-90mg a day and feel functional. I work very very long hours and have 3 kids. I can't be crashing at 4pm. I take about 10 days off a month total so I'm not taking it every day

Where’s my high dose people at?,"I’m prescribed 30mg adderall IR 2x/day, so 60mg IR total. I’m also a woman and not very heavy so people tend to be very surprised when they hear that. My current doc upped my dose from 20mg 2x/day to 30 because it just wasn’t really working for me anymore ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I was already on that 20mg 2x/day dose when I started seeing my current doc, previous doc was honestly kind of wacky and a bit of a pill pusher imho. The first stimulant prescription I ever got was 40mg Ritalin, 3x/day. I was also noticeably underweight at the time (had just recovered from mono). I’ve tried literally all the adhd medications at this point I think, the longer acting meds like adderall XR and concerta interfered wayyy too much with my sleep and Ritalin made me obsessively pick at my skin like a meth head, vyvanse just didn’t seem to do much even though they gave me a pretty high dosage + it was SO expensive, so I ended up with the twice daily adderall IR.

Interesting to hear some of you guys mention that the limit for adderall is 40mg IR/day; I was under the impression that it was 60mg IR/day and insurance has never given me issues about the dosage. I also have a friend who’s prescribed 30mg adderall XR and TWO 20mg adderall IR boosters every day, so 70mg total ? No idea how that happened lol. The kicker is the guy doesn’t even have ADHD, or at least doesn’t take the meds for it. He fills his scripts every month and promptly sells them to pay his bills."
Where’s my high dose people at?,I’m on 30 XR in the morning and then I take a 15 IR in the afternoon. I had to be on just the IR for a while during the peak of the shortage and when I went back to the XR I was like “wow… this feels sooo much nicer. I totally forgot.”
Where’s my high dose people at?,"45mg Dexedrine , which I think is max or close to max dose. But I am regularly skipping a pill here and there because I’m worried I’ll get used to it and it won’t work and I’ll be fucked.  I spent some time away from home this year and ran out of adhd meds (5 weeks off or a bit more). When I returned it was interesting how focused I felt when I restarted them. "
Where’s my high dose people at?,✌ 70mg Elvanse and I cannot imagine ever being lower
Where’s my high dose people at?,You need extended release
Where’s my high dose people at?,I have 80mg vyvanse now and it's on the high side but it still ain't helping me get shit done. I tried going without the extra 20 but on just 60 I'm now a zombie. But on 80 I completely rabbithole ALL the wrong things
Where’s my high dose people at?,"72mg Concerta + 300mg Wellbutrin which I am told are both at the max dose. I honestly did not feel much from anything lower than 72mg of Concerta. Maybe slightly less tired? But I could still easily take a nap on it. Anything lower than \~60mg and I just feel like I haven't taken any meds at all. No clumsiness or anything.  
Similar with the Wellbutrin. I wish I could try a higher dose to possibly help with my hypersomnia, but my doctors don't want to risk it."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I was taking Adderall xr 40mg at 9 am and then 20mg more at 1-2 pm because it burned out so quickly for me. I’m now on 50mg of vyvanse, but not sure if I need increase because I’ve been on this dose less than a week so far. Switched due to anxiety. Vyvanse also lasts 8-ish hours instead of 4-5 for me."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I take 50mlg of vyvanse, and honestly, I think I need to go up in dosage. The first few days were like good, but it's like day 11, and I feel the exact way I did when I wasn't taking them. My next doctors appointment is on the 28th in October, and I'll be out of meds way past then, so we'll see what the doctor says."

Where’s my high dose people at?,"I’m 27m, I take 70mg Vyvanse in the morning which is the max dose and than anywhere around 1pm or so I’m taking my 20mg adderall. Gets me through the rest of the day. Now if I don’t take the high enough dose, I just notice all my mental health issues I have besides ADHD come out a lot more. And what sucks is sometimes the stimulants make me get over fixated on some of my other issues. For example obviously the clutter and millions of thoughts at once in my head stop because of the Vyvanse and I have great focus but I feel like now I hyper focus on my OCD. I will get stuck organize random this and rearranging things for hours without realizing how much time has gone by. So now I’m in the talks of a medication of obsessive behavior"

Where’s my high dose people at?,"I’m back to 54mg Concerta but my doc just told me to take a second one at like 14:00 after I described noticeable drop off mid afternoon whilst working.

I only did it for a few days because 108mg Concerta was wild. I felt weirdly anxious and irritable and just couldn’t switch off. We’ve agreed I’m better off taking the 54 a bit later and just making the most of it.. I think it’s better that way."

Where’s my high dose people at?,"70mg of vyvans in the morning. When stepping up to my current dose i felt more anxious and jittery at 50, then calm as a cucumber at 70."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"Currently on 40-60mg Vyvanse and 15-30mg Aspen Dexamphetamine per day.

The lower range is for when I know I won’t be around people much, higher for when I am.

I regularly try to take the lower dosage to try and reduce my tolerance, as doesn’t take long before I get used to higher levels.

If I take the lower dosage and am around people, the negative self talk creeps in. “They’re upset with me”, “what did I do wrong?”, “I can’t do anything right” and so on.

Basically, under dosing can very quickly lead me down a dark path. If I catch it quickly enough I can take a couple of dex, go to the toilet for 30mins to “get out a stubborn poo” until the meds kick in and the thoughts disappear."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I take 40mg Adderall XR. Sometimes if the generic changes, I get a huge rush for about 30min; But it eventually levels off and I'm good for the day.

That being said, if I forget to take it I struggle during the workday and eat everything in sight. I tried Concerta, but it made me angry lol"

Where’s my high dose people at?,"Not sure what is considered a “high dose” but I usually do 30mg IR in the morning and 30mg IR at noon. If im being honest, sometimes I do 40mg in the morning and 20 at noon depending on if I feel like cutting a pill in half in the morning. It was getting hard to find 30mg tablets so I get 20mg tablets now."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I take 10mg of methylfenidate every 3 hours when I need to function. I study and work so sometimes it's from 8am till 8pm. Also my first dose is sometimes 20mg instead of 10mg because I ""need"" that spike to kickstart my brain to actually do the doings.

Where’s my high dose people at?,"Thank you for mentioning the clumsiness, I thought I was losing my mind when the pharmacy ran out of my medication for a week and I dropped and broke like 8 different glass things during that time frame.

I hadn't broken anything in a really long time before that, but that week I started remembering how I would carry glass objects like they were landmines before being medicated - because if I didn't, I *knew* I'd drop it.

On days I take my meds I get up hike with my dogs, make a to do list and take care of my responsibilities. 

On days I don't take my adderral, I tend to also forget my diabetic and other meds and eat things I shouldn't and have trouble getting out of bed and take a lot of naps.  A few days of that and my blood sugar skyrockets, and then I have trouble getting up because of that, too.  It literally can be deadly."
Where’s my high dose people at?,Im on 50mg vyvanse and it only works til about noon. Next week i start my afternoon booster to see if that helps. Im still a mess but when it wears off at noon i just call it a day cause i overwhelm myself and get nothing done.  I dont consider me a high dose person but maybe i am. Ive never thought about it.
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I used to be prescribed 60mg of adderall a day IR about 7 years ago. I had no idea 40mg was the highest approved dose, do you know how long it’s been that way? I stopped taking it for a while and went back on it about a year ago and I take 30mg IR a day now..20mg in the morning 10mg in the afternoon. I always take a high enough dose but I have missed doses accidentally and purposely and it’s rough for sure. Definitely just makes me grateful to be back on it and also anti depressants after being off of psych meds for a long time."
Where’s my high dose people at?,I have found that if i take vyvanse in the morning and then again about noon everything seems to go smoothly. Dr says we shouldnt do that  though. So vyvanse and a booster at lunch is the next step. I have always slept better with a stimulant on board.  I have no idea why or how its just how it is.

Where’s my high dose people at?,"60 mg adderal daily.

Where’s my high dose people at?,40 is the highest? One of my kids in my class was going apeshit today and I did not get my 20 mg of adderall at noon.  I took 10 and my anxiety medication about 3 p.m.  I am hating my life because of this one five year old and my narcissistic son in law.  The only thing keeping me here is my cats.  I’m at the point where I would almost leave it all to someone else to ensure that my cats are taken care of.  I feel like I suck in every single aspect of my life.
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I was on 40 mg at one point.  I don't know that I would go higher due to side effects, mostly dry mouth , and emotional blunting (mild).  I went back down to 30 mg after changing jobs.  I don't really get tolerance so far luckily.  I do take minibreaks.  If I do feel it is losing it's helpfulness it is usually sleep deprivation, and sometimes bad diet contributing, but ymmv."

Where’s my high dose people at?,I have a question for you guys. I was on Wellbutrin for a few months before I started my vyvanse. I got a lot of benefit from just the Wellbutrin however I think my thoughts are sharper and I feel generally this fidgety. I'm at 40 mg though which seems a little too low right now. Did anyone else experience not really feeling very impressed until the dosage increased?
Where’s my high dose people at?,"60mg of Vyvanse + 2x 10mg Dexedrine spansules (In the morning) + 2x 10mg Dexedrine spansules (In the afternoon), for few years now. Works well for me.

The extra in the afternoon is so it lasts longer - And the extra in the morning is so I could wake up easier. Now that I'm on Vraylar, I can mostly wake up in the morning without the stimulant - So I take it an hour after I wake up now instead of an hour before I wake up again."

Where’s my high dose people at?,"Was at the max dose of Azstarys, felt nothing at all.

Talked to the doctor today and she says well it sounds like you’re just expecting the rush you get. It’s normal to wear off after a period of time.

I’m like yeah but, should I feel absolutely nothing on a stimulant? I’ve seen a lot of negativity about Azstarys, it’s clean compared to adderall. But now I just take it to not get headaches after not taking it for two days. Last time I took it the other day I was so tired 3 hours later, I could barely drive home. This is a max dose of a stimulant, on 8 hours of sleep, hours before my normal bed time, something tells me I shouldn’t be driving home saying “I can’t wait to go home and sleep.”

Anyways she started me on the lowest dose of adderall XR, but she made me feel like an adrenaline junkie. Even though my therapist talked to me to describe how I feel and to not say things like I get tired out, or I lose the focus and “energy rush I get.”

I still did it anyways because I froze up and couldn’t think. I still mentioned how at work I constantly forget what I’m about to do, regardless of the fact I’ve done the same thing many times, but once I mentioned the energy it was too late. 

Then I go to work and I’m pouring flour into a regular bowl instead of the mixer, completely zoned out. I can do it right 200 times but that temp zone out is horrific. Then you look down confused as hell and your co workers look over at you and start laughing like crazy. 😳"

Where’s my high dose people at?,I’m on max dose methylphenidate patches. First thing I notice if I don’t have it or have a low dose is my executive dysfunction comes back with a vengeance. I also notice I’m quicker to anger and my short term memory is really bad.
Where’s my high dose people at?,I take 30mg in the AM & 30mg in the afternoon.  Mine is that high because I’m exhausted if it’s not. I wouldn’t be able to function properly with any other dose. I often take 20mg three times a day if I have a longer day planned & the 3 doses works just as well as the 2 doses.
Where’s my high dose people at?,Always clumsy!
Where’s my high dose people at?,"70mg per day, up to 80 permitted by doc. 30mg Adderall XR twice a day (so 60 XR) and a 10mg Adderall IR is the standard day. 30 upon waking up. 30 around 12-1pm. Half a 10mg IR is needed to even get moving in the AM. Another half towards the middle of the afternoon. Or I can take the full additional 10mg in one go. I'm permitted to take another 10, but I generally try not to. Seems pointless, even wasteful.
Honestly, nothing is working well with my ADD meds anymore. For reference, I'm female and 120-125lbs on a good day. I also have autoimmune conditions and my thyroid doesn't work so I'm unable to gain weight or hardly eat a semi decent amount of food per day. No drug abuse, whether prescription or other. I have always had a natural bodily response where medication doesn't affect me like others. I've been known to literally wake up in the middle of major surgery and start swinging at the staff while trying to rip the breathing tube out of my throat, too. That's happened at least 8x that are documented for my medical records. 
If I don't take my meds, I'm absolutely useless with any life tasks including basic conversation (work or personal). I have severe migraines and yet can't get decent rest - that's with or without meds. I get very irritable, have no problem biting someone's head off verbally (regardless of who it is), and I basically don't even want to hear anyone's voice or go out in public. So yea, you might say I'm not sure how to find a mixture that works better for me, but I am sure if I don't take mine on time for each dose per day, it would be worse."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I don’t know if it is considered high dose or not but 50mg Elvanse here. I had to rise my dose because my body digests the medication way too fast. It is supposed to last 14 hours and in me it lasts around 5/6h at most.
Doctor said if it keeps only lasting this little I’ll have to take twice a day, 30mg/2x."
Where’s my high dose people at?,Lol 70mg of Vyvanse and 80mg of strattera for uni. My summer dose is 40mg of vyvanse. Also side note did anybody know that stopping taking adhd medication can result in tired ness??? I stopped taking my meds for a few days of summer and was a couch potato all day and actually napped… I never nap! Only when I’m sick or during Yk?
Where’s my high dose people at?,I'm supposed to take 20mg twice a day but usually I just take it once it makes me really irritable and gives me bad anxiety
Where’s my high dose people at?,"Im on 60mg of Adderall. I also have sleep issues, diagnosed with sleep apnea but possibly narcolepsy too. I take 40mg just to wake up in the morning and then I take the other 20 depending on my day. If I'm getting up at 7am, I set an alarm for 530/6am and take my 40mg and go back to sleep. If I don't set an alarm I can take the 40mg and still sleep all day -.- I start getting run down in the early afternoon like 12-1pm so I usually take the other 20 around then. Some days I wait too long and I end up having to take a nap and don't take the other 20mg. If I'm driving home from somewhere like 30 mins+ away I take one like 30 mins before im leaving so I don't fall asleep driving. I still struggle with keeping on track with tasks a lot of times so sometimes it feels like I'm taking them just to attempt to stay awake. I moved in to a place Sept 1st and trying to put everything away where it belongs and stuff has been hard. I bounce around from task to task and have a hard time getting one thing completed and it's really disheartening knowing I'm medicated and still struggling so much."

Where’s my high dose people at?,"Adderall XR 30 mg morning + 30 mg around lunchtime. (On top of Wellbutrin XR 300 mg, if you also count that). 

I guess I’m a fast metaboliser of amphetamines – one dose 30 mg XR will last no more than 4 hours, and one dose of 30 mg IR will only last for a maximum of 1 hour. I’ve gone through Ritalin, Aduvanz, and Attentin without effect. (Where I live, Adderall is the very last “line of defence” for ADHD. I couldn’t do Strattera due to Wellbutrin.) I also take precaution as the when and what I eat and drink around dosing (and throughout the day in general).

A dose of 10 mg XR won’t have any noteworthy effect, while a dose of 20 mg XR will have a low and short effect. The first clue of a missed dose or declining effect is, what I call, the “ADHD-radio” (the 143 tabs open, 14 of which are either conversation, playing music, or sounds constantly in our head), and being overly whimsical and talkative (about certain subjects to certain people – who are not necessarily very interested in the subject, though some find my theatrical presentation entertaining). 

I guess you can also tell by the way I’m writing that I have yet to take my first dose of the day. "

I recently switched to a random generic. 
Now, I’m in Austin TX at the moment(vacation) I’m all out of meds hoping with my NZ prescriptions and doctors letter I will get Adderall. I have a current prescription with 2x refills, it’s just that I’m away overseas so I can’t get it.

Where’s my high dose people at?,Does the XR at noon give you any problem sleeping?
Where’s my high dose people at?,"So curious what career you have that you’re able to be successful at with such extreme ADHD? Asking because maybe I need to be doing the type of work you’re doing, lol. On a side note, the highest dose of  Adderall I’ve ever taken is 30 and it made me so on edge, exacerbated my anxiety, and fed my OCD. Amazing that it doesn’t affect you that way."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I do 60mg Adderall XR in the morning, how would I go about trying to switch to 50mg then 30mg at noon?"
Where’s my high dose people at?,"Assuming you are on generic not brand name, are there some generic brands (the morning IR or afternoon XR) that don’t work right for you? I’m still titrating and figuring out the combo. A couple days of 20mg IR and 20 mg XR seems perfect (the 20 mg XR only worked for about a week). Then I got refills 2-3 days later and it went to absolute crap. But I can’t tell if it was dose or manufacturer related. I’m now trying IR 2x a day and it’s a totally different manufacturer and seems fine (no severe head-pressure head aches which is what happened in some of my IR+XR test runs)"
Where’s my high dose people at?,Do they make 50 mg Adderall XR tablets?
Where’s my high dose people at?,Woah. I think my brain and heart would explode lol. Glad you’re getting the care you deserve mate.
Where’s my high dose people at?,"Wow, I moved to a new state recently, and every doctor I talk to is astounded that I have been taking 40 mg of IR.

Most of them refuse to prescribe anything at all.  I finally found a provider, but they are constantly checking my blood pressure (which has been fine so far), doing ""surprise"" drug tests, and threatening to reduce my prescription every visit just because they think it's too much.

I wouldn't be surprised if the stress from all the pushback will be the thing that raises my blood pressure, because I can't function on any less than what I'm taking."
Where’s my high dose people at?,Nice
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I'm on 70 vyvance too.. my doctor split it up though as I feel like it wears off in 4 hours one 40 pill and one 30. 

I am starting to wonder if another drug would be beneficial as the effectiveness of the drug goes away slowly unless I take breaks."
Where’s my high dose people at?,Vivance felt like quitting Adderall without the withdrawal. Hated it.
Where’s my high dose people at?,"If you have side effects like headache (or worse) when the dosis is going down in your body, consider taking 10mg after lunch. It can happen when it goes down quickly. May split like 50/30 depending on what you really need. But of course talk to your doctor."
Where’s my high dose people at?,Adding Strattera or Qelbree might help.
Where’s my high dose people at?,"When I was on 70mg vyvanse, I could barely sleep and I ended up having a panic attack in the middle of a class. Took a little tolerance break and switched to adderall after that one. I’ve been sitting at 20 mg a while and I get way less side effects."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"Vyvanse 60 here but took 70 for about a month. I finally tried MPH and couldn’t stay awake. Back on 60 of Vyvanse. I would like to go back to 70 but my PA always wants to “leave room”, which makes no sense.  Side note: I’m fed up with doctors and patients treating the FDA Guidelines as LAW. They’re called guidelines ffs. I’ve read case reports where some patients only found success around 125 mg of Vyvanse (regardless of body mass). Obviously not common but some people are fast metabolizers. IT’S NOT ILLEGAL TO RX ABOVE FDA GUIDELINES!"
Where’s my high dose people at?,"40mg in the AM, 30mg in afternoon, no issues for 10 years now."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"lol I feel the same way. It is honestly terrible, but I feel normal when I do take it and like shit when I don’t take it."
Where’s my high dose people at?,Amphetamine isn’t for everybody. Some people just need the stimulation without the rough edge that Amphetamine packs. Tho I do know people who had better luck on Adderall and Vyvanse and had anxiety on Ritalin and felt the most zippy on it.
Where’s my high dose people at?,"It sounds like your doctor has your doses too high! I've played around with a lot of different doses/meds and I've always had a really high tolerance to the stimulants--- but weirdly what I found the most effective were the 5mg quick release tablets taken between 2 and four times a day. Less intrusive, less likely to mess with my sleep. With Vyvanse I normally take a 30mg twice daily with breaks... Although because of the ups and downs and time lag for the drug it's hard for me to not want to take a third which I will ALWAYS regret around 3am :(."
Where’s my high dose people at?,I have been medicated for 7 years consistently and off and on as a adolescent….. Concerta was a miracle for me however when the shortage occurred I had to try different medications I’ve tried them all and have made my way back to stability 72mg Concerta + 10 dextomethalphenidate on the afternoon.
Where’s my high dose people at?,I wanna know what 20 does to you ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|surprise)
Where’s my high dose people at?,Seriously. I know this post isn’t for me cause I’m over here on 5mg Adderall but when I take 10 I can feel it and any more than that I can’t even handle. And I have severe add. Idk how people can do it but then again I’m pretty small lol
Where’s my high dose people at?,is 20 vyvanase your dose. does it work ok? how long have you been taking it?
Where’s my high dose people at?,"Same! I just decreased to 15mg because 20 was giving me a lot of undesirable side effects. It is too soon to tell since the switch was 2 days ago, I haven’t worked yet; but I had a fairly productive weekend so I hope that’s a good sign. 20 was good for work, but the side effects were making me feel kinda off (just NO appetite, losing weight, dry mouth even when drinking water and electrolytes). Hoping 15 is better for me! 🤞"
Where’s my high dose people at?,When I take bets blockers for the occasional work presentation my adderall doesn’t work. My doctor said they cancel eachother out. Do you think that’s why you’re able to take a high dose of stimulants?
Where’s my high dose people at?,Can i ask if you had only concerta before? And if you did what was the difference?
Where’s my high dose people at?,mydayis?
Where’s my high dose people at?,That sounds amazing compared to what I do now 
Where’s my high dose people at?,Damn at this point maybe it's just time to accept that meds aren't working correctly. That is a huge regimen. Hopefully it at least keeps you feeling ok.
Where’s my high dose people at?,"FYI most people don’t realize the conversions. I have tables based on the actual lisdexamfetamine (LDX) - mixed amphetamine salts (MAS) ratios.     

LDX (Vyvanse) —> MAS (Adderall)   
5 mg    ->   1.6 mg   
10 mg  ->   3.2 mg   
20 mg  ->   6.4 mg   
30 mg  ->   9.6 mg   
40 mg ->  12.8 mg   
50 mg ->  16 mg     
60 mg ->  19.2 mg   
70 mg ->   22.4 mg     
  
Therefore, 100 mg of Vyvanse is chemically equivalent to ~30 mg of IR Adderall. If you think about that you’ll realize the FDA recommended doses for Vyvanse are rather low imo.  

You’re probably a rapid metabolizer. I took a genetic test showing I am. I always require much higher doses of most medications than other people. I can take 70 Vyvanse no problem. My PA won’t let me go higher at the moment but I think I would actually benefit from it as I effectively have “chronic fatigue” (not diagnosed) and really need the amp in amphetamine. Otherwise I’m like a depressed zombie slug. And that’s with Prozac and other psych meds! 

Sorry for the formatting. I’m on mobile."
Where’s my high dose people at?,Haha this should be the top voted comment.
Where’s my high dose people at?,"Wellbeing inhibits cyp2d6 which Atomoxetine and Vyvanse get metabolized by.

Where’s my high dose people at?,Goddamn. I'm on 30mg and I feel like I'm putting my body through a lot. On a few rare occasions I've taken 2 30's and felt absolutely wired. Like jaw clenchingly wired. Did you switch straight from 30mg of adderall to 70 or vyvanse? Or do 40mg vyvanse in between?
Where’s my high dose people at?,"Lol no way that’s high dose. Even the recommended maximum is not a as high as people think. 70 mg of Vyvanse is only roughly equivalent to 22.5 mg Adderall. And seeing how Adderall is 2-3x per day, the max recommended dose of Vyvanse should really be closer to 180 mg. "
Where’s my high dose people at?,Same exact deal over here. Sometimes I don’t think it covers the entire day ESPECIALLY if I take it early in the morning.
Where’s my high dose people at?,It’s because it IS arbitrary and based on archaic knowledge of ADHD mixed with the misconception that if you take “too much” that you will go full Wolf of Wall Street. 
Where’s my high dose people at?,Are you in the US? I’m wondering how you’ve gotten your doctor and or insurance to allow you that much. I can’t get my doc to go above 40mg daily. Insurance says they’d approve up to 60mg daily.
Where’s my high dose people at?,I used to drink a redbull if I couldn't fall asleep.  I have been curious if taking my 10mg booster later would work.  How long before you go to sleep do you usually take it?
Where’s my high dose people at?,"Hey I used to have the same issue! 

I do 40mg vyvanse in the morning and 10mg adderall IR around 12:00. If 40 is working well for you during the morning, ask about trying a PM adderall dose!"
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I had the same issue, I’m on 30mg vyvanse and now take 10mg of dextro in the afternoon. It’s been a game changer for me because I really like my vyvanse and I don’t think that needs to be upped. It just needs to last longer lol"
Where’s my high dose people at?,That's MY name. Jello. I get it
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I used to be on that schedule too, but currently am on 20mg IR thrice a day, which has been far more effective for me."
Where’s my high dose people at?,Same lol which is equivalent to approximately 120 mg of Adderall a day 😅 but ultra rapid metabolizer too. Like ultra ultra fucking rapid lol
Where’s my high dose people at?,Same!
Where’s my high dose people at?,Same.
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I agree with this. I see a lot of people talking about needing a high dose for it to last all day. Stimulant dosing is funky and it tends to work WORSE if you’re on a dose that’s too high. If a high dose isn’t working well, the answer is sometimes to lower the dose instead of raise it! I had to lower one of my meds for this reason and it ended up working a lot better.

You also tend to get better symptom reduction if you take your medication in smaller doses spaced out evenly throughout the day. That way you can keep your dosage at the amount that works best for you while keeping up with your metabolism."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I feel you on that. I’m fine now, but there were times where I’d take my current dose before my tolerance had fully adjusted and I had pretty strenuous issues with it physically, but my brain was very satisfied with it always, and I functioned at a level that went beyond that initial major improvement in my symptoms after I started the medication"
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I told someone else about this, but I’d definitely recommend trying a PM booster dose of adderall IR if your vyvanse is wearing off early if you don’t like taking a single 80mg dose. Ignore me if it’s working fine for you though!"
Where’s my high dose people at?,XR spansule or IR?
Where’s my high dose people at?,"You are set the fuck up, god damn. I’m on 70mg of Vyvanse and it’s not doing it. Working through solutions that isn’t another stim to put on top but I don’t think it’s doing much."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"it should not carry over, methylphenidate and amphetamines are pretty different in terms of mechanism. There’s some research out there about people using Vyvanse for a week or two in place of Ritalin to reset their tolerance, can’t remember the results specifically. Even so, your neurobiology won’t be a clean slate—using psych drugs and building tolerance in itself alters our reward pathways."
Where’s my high dose people at?,Guanfacine crew!
Where’s my high dose people at?,Have you looked into genesite testing? I’m on the same dose plus a stimulant and I feel like neither help with my adhd. The testing shows how your body reacts to different medications. Waiting for my results which should be in this week.
Where’s my high dose people at?,I’m on 80 atomoxatine and 25 Ritalin.  I thought 80 was max?
Where’s my high dose people at?,Ritalin made me feel the same way. it also raised my bp to a dangerous level
Where’s my high dose people at?,"> I also recognize that 80mg a day is a lot, so I’m getting by with 60 for now.

No, that’s not how it works. Unless YOU feel it’s too much, i.e. side effects are strong OR there’s no added benefit, it’s not too much. Underdosing is a widespread issue, often based on arbitrary amounts that work for “most” people.

You may want to revisit that “random decision” your doctor unilaterally took last year."
Where’s my high dose people at?,My doc lets me split mine up into 3 doses as well
Where’s my high dose people at?,What do you mean?
Where’s my high dose people at?,I am prescribed 40mg of Adderall IR a day and it helps of course but I hate how fast tolerance goes up and down with stimulants. I basically HAVE to go days without taking it or else the effectiveness goes down
Where’s my high dose people at?,This is what I’ve been trying to get my doc to allow. He admits that I’m a fast metabolizer as well. He won’t go past the 40mg a day because of the FDA limit. I essentially crash out by late afternoon.
Where’s my high dose people at?,Same
Where’s my high dose people at?,"If you don't mind my asking, why the change? I am currently on 60mg/day of dexedrine and have some concerns about the sustainability of this."
Where’s my high dose people at?,While awake?
Where’s my high dose people at?,I just got prescribed 10s Adderall XR at the moment first time
Where’s my high dose people at?,"Concerta is a different form of the same med that's in Ritalin. Adderall is a whole different thing, closer to Vyvanse."
Where’s my high dose people at?,What is a Ritalin test? Is that where they test your genetics to see which specific drugs your body reacts to
Where’s my high dose people at?,"Are the XR and IR reversed in this? Or what's a typical XR dose? I thought people took XR once a day, so twice would make up for fast metabolizing. Do most people take XR twice, so you need a third dose?"
Where’s my high dose people at?,Ugh I'm holding out on going to 70mg Vyvanse but that midday existential dread that hits....😭
Where’s my high dose people at?,Man that's complicated. How long did it take you to settle on that regime?
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I get 20mg tablets as well. I take 1.5 tabs twice a day usually, or 1 tab three times a day"
Where’s my high dose people at?,I’m sorry you’re experiencing this. Please talk with someone 😔

Where’s my high dose people at?,Same here. Been on that dose for years and I’ve developed a tolerance to it and unfortunately can’t go any higher. Sucks
Where’s my high dose people at?,Is it working nicely?
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I’m on the same dose of Vyvanse. Works quite well but I have to have 7-8 hours of sleep or I’m still unable to focus. 

On the up side it works 12-14 hours (but takes 2 hours to start working).

No issues with motor skills beyond my normal level of clumsy."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I’m still pretty clumsy regardless of what dose I’m on, but interestingly, I’m a pretty shit driver but seem to ding my car less when medicated 🤷‍♀️"
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I've always been clumsy, but since going on meds, it's MUCH worse when I am off them. Not a side effect I was expecting."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"So that's actually very interesting... May I ask, how long have you been medicated on stimulants & what were you like before them? 

I have my reasons for the questions - I have multiple diagnoses that I wasn't aware of an overlap in certain symptoms until years later."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I’m also on 60 mg of Vyvanse, and I find I get SUPER clumsy for about 10 minutes *right* as it’s starting to kick in. But once it’s active, I’m more coordinated than I am without it. 

And it usually starts working in about 30-45 minutes for me! But on the downside, I feel like it wears off after about 6-8 hours, depending on where I am in my menstrual cycle. 😔"
Where’s my high dose people at?,Yes clumsy etc.
Where’s my high dose people at?,"As my specialist explained, everybody has a different reaction to each different ADHD medication. There’s no one size fits all."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"For me it helps in particular with focus, inattentiveness/carelessness and general EF before/after concerta’s 12hr window of effectiveness - there’s def a big difference between when my concerta is in effect versus when it’s finished, but I feel the strattera is in particular helping me to be “less ADHD” in the mornings and evenings.

I also don’t notice the evening come down from the Concerta as much anymore…

Lastly, my mind remains “quiet” for the whole day almost every day now, which tbh I’m still getting used to hahaha, the silence of my mind sometimes weirds me out when I realise I’ve been sitting quietly, or doing something, but without concurrently thinking about anything else at all lol. So weird. But it’s helped a lot in that I’m able to switch off and just go to sleep so much better now too. My screen time has even dropped significantly, with no conscious, deliberate change in habits by me. It might be a coincidence, but I’m not gonna look a gift horse in the mouth wherever that’s coming from lol.

Though all this being said, it takes up to a month for any dosage of Strattera to start fully working so my current dose, which my doc increased only 2 weeks ago from the initial 40 to 65, is probably not quite at maximum efficacy yet."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"Also interested in this. I'm titrating up on concerta and am likely going to end on a pretty high dose. While it's reducing my need to impulsively hop from thought to thought it's not doing much for my overall ability to actually focus. We're sticking with concerta though because I have a condition that stimulants can aggravate and concerta isn't making that worse, so I might need an extra assist."
Where’s my high dose people at?,I have severe ADHD-PI and no heart palpitations due to high dosages. Lower dosages have not alleviated any symptoms. I might as well be taking Tik-Taks.
Where’s my high dose people at?,"Haha I'm not sure if your question abt narcolepsy was a joke or not, but I just asked you some questions potentially eluding to the mostly unaware fact that there can be certain overlap in symptoms between ADD & narcolepsy."
Where’s my high dose people at?,I start on about 75mg of Adderall in the morning then another 25mg at noon. I do have narcolepsy though. ADHD and narcolepsy is the worst combination to have. 😵‍💫
Where’s my high dose people at?,Nope. PTSD and high stress interfere with my ability to sleep. I have struggled with insomnia for 25 years.
Where’s my high dose people at?,"It depends how fast you metabolize the medication. For me, XR versions lasted between 4 and 6 hours so taking it at noon was really not a problem. If you're one of the lucky few that have their meds last 12 hours, then it's probably not a good idea to take it at noon."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I came up with something. First it was night classes, but when those ended I claimed I was still tutoring people in the evening (I was helping classmates with their homework but wasn't 'officially' tutoring anymore). You need to have a good reason to get an evening dose, something that requires your attention in the evening. Things like book work or a job is usually what they will definitely approve of. I would not recommend doses though. Many doctors get offended by this because that is their expertise and they might see it as a red flag for addict behavior. Let them decide the dosage. They usually keep you on your regular morning dose then give you half of that for the evening. I was on XR in the morning and a regular one in the evening."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"not asking me but funny enough im a pharmacy tech with severe adhd, my highest dose of adderall was 60mg a day then i switched to vyvanse but not really a fan. my job is fast paced but i really just count pills all day and am able to get by on a thin line when my symptoms are flaring up"
Where’s my high dose people at?,"Most definitely it’s the manufacturer. FDA requires generic drugs to have a certain percentage of the active ingredient, with the remaining ingredients fillers. 😠"
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I think 30mg XR is highest, you would have to get 2 doses. One you have to get a doctor to prescribe 60, then insurance to cover it. More than likely you get 30mg of XR then 5-10mg of IR."
Where’s my high dose people at?,I get about 9 or 10 hours out of it. On days I need a boost I take IR Adderall. 
Where’s my high dose people at?,I second this! I felt the same way about Vyvance.
Where’s my high dose people at?,"Damn, I didn't know this and I'm sitting here after work with a migraine 😬 I've been on generic Vyvanse for a while now, but these last two prescriptions have either just been not working or working too well with hard crashes. I'm going to the doctor tomorrow for a medication check and I'm thinking of seeing if I should try something else or see if a booster might help? Idk the brand name has worked so well for me but my new insurance refuses to cover it"
Where’s my high dose people at?,Hmm interesting! It’s so crazy how different brain chemistry can be lol. Have you heard anything about Concerta? Yeah I haven’t heard the best things about Ritalin. And I’m very prone to anxiety.
Where’s my high dose people at?,I take Vyvanse and IR Adderall. I tried various methylphenidate products and while MPH allowed me to think clearly it made me so damn tired and fatigued all the time I had to go back to Vyvanse for my sanity. On MPH ALL I wanted to do was sleep all the time. Zero side effects besides that though!
Where’s my high dose people at?,Oh good to know! Thanks!
Where’s my high dose people at?,"20mg Adderall. Temporarily silences the voices in my head, helping me think and articulate clearer, and focus better. When I work with meds, It feels as if I’m a robot. I can somehow get things done without my brain distracting me. It’s almost night and day compared to attempting to be productive unmedicated. Even after years of being prescribed meds, it is difficult to describe. 20mg is much stronger compared to the 15 and 10mg I used to take. I could literally feel the difference after my personal test run. 

For me, meds come at the cost of heightened anxiety, poor appetite (wanting to gag when eating and seeing food), mood swings, weird bladder issues, occasional stomach issues, and mild insomnia."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I think it’s just a mystery body chemistry thing because I consider my ADHD symptoms to be mild to moderate, especially in comparison to how some people describe theirs here and 15mg of Adderall didn’t feel like anything (but 20 was indeed too high) so I’m on 54mg of Concerta, the highest to second-highest dose, despite having an average-build female body"
Where’s my high dose people at?,"There are two types of beta blockers. Ones that cross the blood brain barrier and cause calming effects, and ones that don't, and don't have much of a psychoactive effect. Atenolol doesn't cross the BBB and will lower heart rate, blood pressure, reduce sweating and tremors. Propranolol will do this plus reduce anxiety."
Where’s my high dose people at?,I have only been medicated since March and only on Concerta
Where’s my high dose people at?,Yup. The medical name is like dextraAmephetamine Salts (I can’t be bothered to get out of bed and go grab the bottle in the kitchen)
Where’s my high dose people at?,"They all help some. You can still tell I have ADHD with them but it's much better & my house isn't on fire.  Apparently, I got all the ADHD."
Where’s my high dose people at?,I think I should definitely get some DNA testing.  There is a definite difference from 70mg of Vyvanse to 100mg for me.  Thanks for sharing!
Where’s my high dose people at?,Perhaps I am an ultra-rapid CYP2D6 metabolizer. I also get violently ill from opiods.  Maybe some DNA testing could shed some light? #studyme
Where’s my high dose people at?,That’s because 30 mg of Adderall is closer to 90-100 mg of Vyvanse. See my other comment for the conversions. 
Where’s my high dose people at?,"Idk what ur talking abt I don’t take vyvanse and I don’t know why u thought I did lmfaooo 

You can check adhdmedcalc.com for some accurate info lmao :)"
Where’s my high dose people at?,"Yup, I'm on 60mg a day (20mg IR 3x/day). It covers *most* of the day, but that's only if I stretch out when I take each dose. Each pill feels like it only really works for about 2-3ish hours, but sometimes if I hit a flow state they feel like they work for 4-5ish hours.

Was actually considering asking the doc if I could do a month script of dexmethylphenidate IR to maybe slightly reset the D:Lamph tolerance from the high dose. Even though they obviously have some cross tolerance, I've heard that alternating between the two meds can be a reasonable substitute if you're unable to take a medication vacation..."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"Tbh, if you take too much all at once, yeah, you definitely can go full Wolf of Wall Street... Or alternatively, you just feel like a glazed donut, LMAO.

But, from what I understand from my own experience (and that of others I've heard) is that worsening side effects are enough to keep someone from taking too large a dose. The primary issue most people seem to have is with length of action."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I am in the US and on Medicaid. I've been on 60mg for 5 years after about a decade of fighting with doctors in three different states.  It was really difficult to get to this level and then also to get 3x20mg a day vs 2x30.  

But basically I just switched doctors and found someone who actually has ADHD and understands.  I also went in and got re-tested for ADHD and the testing recommended 60mg per day because I am actually just that inattentive and disregulated."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"It changes daily to be honest, but most times I take it about an hour before bed and I sleep like a baby for at least 6-8 hours.  Occasionally it makes it more difficult to sleep if I've got a special interest and can't stop thinking about that but I don't know if anything can stop that besides yoga and meditation."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"As a Eu person. They don’t prescribe adderall or alternative pm am tabs.
But I talked with my doc about even 40 does not fully fix my drop in focus and motivation after half day. And there might be some combo I can try.
First I’m going on 50 . Cuz heart and everything looks the same"
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I wouldn’t be able to sleep if I had to take 3 doses a day. I already take my 2nd dose way sooner than my script says that I’m supposed to.

Usually I’ll take my 1st at 8:30am and my 2nd at 11:00. If I take it after 12pm, I almost always get less than 6 hours of sleep."

Where’s my high dose people at?,"I just got mine done because Adderall XR 2x daily wasn't doing anything at all for me. Found out stims have almost no effect on me.  It sucks. Just started Strattera to see if that works.  They were all green zoned for my body chemistry.  It's a much longer process to see if it works, but willing to try anything."

I also have a 19mg afternoon booster that I stopped taking for the same reason that it made no difference - what helps more is having a feeling of having something to actually live for."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"Being switched to different medications each month because of supply issues, is making me up and down. I was titrated on Concerta and I have been given all different types of methylphenidate which release slightly differently. So I’m up and down in that sense. 
Hoping concerta issues are sorted soon in the uk."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"That's a bummer, I haven't noticed any tolerance build up but if I go a day or two without my meds I'm a complete wreck."
Where’s my high dose people at?,I believe the max for using dexedrine to treat narcolepsy is 60mg/day. That was how my psychiatrist was able to justify it.

Where’s my high dose people at?,"No, that's gene sight testing. Ritalin test is for concentration levels."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"XR lasts about 4.5 to 5 hours max in my system. I live with multiple autoimmune diseases in many of the factors from those conditions contribute to my window of effectiveness for ADHD meds. This means I have IR boosters in between the XRs if the XR med isn't kicking in or metabolizing properly. 
Everyone has a very different genetic system and everyone's dosing plan is going to be different. My best advice is to find a provider who's willing to work with you and try different things."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"Sometimes it hit me so hard midday that id doze off in my office chair (I own my own business so it's not as bad as it sounds lol). With the Adderall bump I power through it pretty well. What Mg Vyvanse are you currently on? I switched from 60mg IR adderall ( 30 morning 30 afternoon) to 70mg Vyvanse when my doc went to seeing inpatients only. I went to the doc who oversaw my previous doc and she was the one that switched me. Didnt really notice much of a difference except I dont forget my afternoon dose now and I can get my day jumpstarted quicker with a coffee with the Vyvanse. Vyvanse is better than adderall for me and feels smoother. Also, im lucky because my pharmacy can only get name brand Vyvanse right now and my insurance has approved it until generic becomes available. But I agree, that midday lull suckssssssss."
Where’s my high dose people at?,Just got upped last week lol
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I do 60mg, too. Depends on the day it feels like for me. I generally get 7-10 hours a day but yeah se days it feels like it's not working at all. Others I'm feeling good. Not sure why but this makes me want to be more mindful of surrounding factors."
Where’s my high dose people at?,The two hour delay really grinds my gears but I LOVE Vyvanse. 
Where’s my high dose people at?,"There’s studies on this! That ppl with adhd tend to get in less car accidents if/when medicated lol 
I also have the same experience"
Where’s my high dose people at?,Yeah it’s definitely worse without it now. I’m super clumsy and legit can hardly finish a sentence. It’s really weird. My short term memory completely vanishes and I have trouble finding the right words when speaking. It’s pretty dramatic. 
Where’s my high dose people at?,"Okay now I’m curious. I’m on 15 mg adderall IR 3x/day. I’ve been medicated since 2007, and on this specific dosage since 2014 (decreased during my 2 pregnancies but I went back up after done breastfeeding). Always been clumsy, but it’s definitely gotten much worse—though I assume because I’m now mid-30s. I’m still clumsier than average on meds, but off of it, I’m awful."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I’ve been chasing med doses for a long time. Most providers will try to insist you stay within the guidelines. Which is a safe negligence proof policy of treatment that I’m sure they believe is in your overall best interest. However, I have found that, just by its nature, ADHD is entirely subjective. What really matters is finding a dose that helps you keep your life together where the benefits outweigh the risks. People point out the cardiovascular ramifications to elevated stimulant doses. Which is fair. However, I think what’s lacking from that analysis is the very real implications that inadequately managed ADHD has on an individual’s health. For me it has had profound economic, social and psychological ramifications that absolutely have been a detriment to my overall wellbeing. I can’t quantify it, but those impacts have absolutely taken a hit to my overall longevity."
Where’s my high dose people at?,My provider said most people with ADHD are under-dosed. 
Where’s my high dose people at?,What’s ADHD-PI?
Where’s my high dose people at?,Facts highest my BP ever has been on meds is 90 118..
Where’s my high dose people at?,[removed]
Where’s my high dose people at?,"Did you have them or other heart symptoms at any point in your med process? I'm PI, and nothings ever effected my heart. 70mg Vyvanse and my normal resting was under 50 still, low BP , could down a case of energy drinks. I'm on 20mg aderall xr and it's not.... causing me problems but my stats are the high end of a normal person now."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"Same here.  I am on 40mg of Adderall for both my narcolepsy and ADHD, I feel like I could go up on my dosage. I’m always going into spells throughout the day.  I also take anxiety meds (50 mg - Zoloft) so I’m  leery on adding more to my plate."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"Name checks out, unfortunately...damn."
Where’s my high dose people at?,Be well brother
Where’s my high dose people at?,Plenty of us take stimulants to be able to sleep also. I take 10mg Adderall XR with dinner so that my mind chills out enough for me to sleep all night. I think it is something like 1 in 3 that sleep better with stimulants.
Where’s my high dose people at?,"😂 awful yes but so true. My doctor thinks I work 2 jobs and go to school so she has me on 30 mg dexamphetamine IR 3x daily - breakfast, lunch, and dinner basically lmao - and I do none of that. It makes me feel guilty to be deceptive but I'm sure she gets paid well and as long as she's not losing her license, and my health is fine with no signs of abuse that would make me a liability, she doesn't mind lol she gets paid and I get medicated then I'm on my way! 🚶🏻‍♂️"
Where’s my high dose people at?,Do you get subscribed this?
Where’s my high dose people at?,Make sure to differentiate between side effects that occur when the dosis reaches its peak (1-2h) and when it goes down. AFAIK first would be too high of a dose and second dosis going down too fast. Good luck!
Where’s my high dose people at?,"Concerta is a long acting version of Ritalin. They both have the same active ingredient called Methylphenidate. When you try a new stimulant medication it’s def always a risk that you’ll get anxiety or have problems with it. There’s 2 main ingredient bases in the stimulants. Amphetamines and Methylphenidate. Amphetamines would be Adderall and Vyvanse. The active ingredient in Vyvanse binds to molecules in your body and converts into amphetamine inside your body. Pretty much it’s either one or the other as far as whether or not one is better or works for you period. When the stimulants don’t work there are alternatives, but stimulants are the most effective treatments for ADHD according to the medical community."
Where’s my high dose people at?,I personally hated concerta. Was super irritable & one time my mom found me in a closet scratching myself and picking my skin neurotically lmao 😭. Adderall and vyvanse worked best for me but everyone’s different
Where’s my high dose people at?,"Oh wow! I'm always super interested in reading how it affects people differently! That actually sounds really nice. It's wild because I'm the exact opposite. It makes my anxiety disappear and I eat and sleep pretty well and overall just in a much better mood, but I'm on 60-90 mg ad IR a day. I feel like if I skip a dose, I feel ALL the anxiety and I randomly just cry lmao not from withdrawal or anything, because actually I skip a lot because I always forget to even take it, or I don't know if I did or not because I'd put it down somewhere and go get a glass of water and then wander off, but circle back around and I have to seriously question myself since I forgot I was even going to get water to take it, so I just skip altogether in fear of double dosing for no reason. But because it mutes my negative emotions regarding any regular life stressors that contributes to my anxiety, I feel a craaazzzy rush of reality hit me when I'm without, and I almost can't sleep if I don't take it that day, so NOT taking it GIVES me insomnia??- interesting how it actually causes you anxiety with an increase, though, because it may calm me too much and it makes me really sleepy and chill, but you either get that or a freaking fresh border collie pup with the zoomies who can't stfu or sit tf down off meds ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|flip_out)"
Where’s my high dose people at?,I was reading this thread and noticed your post mentioning bladder issues. Are you taking any antidepressants as well?
Where’s my high dose people at?,I wish I could find something that quiets my inner voice.  I’m in adderall 20mg XR in the morning and regular 10mg in the afternoon.  This just makes me sharper and able to actually focus better but still with my inner voice or music going in my head at all times
Where’s my high dose people at?,"My bad, i meant only 54mg of concerta, i forgot to put the amount"
Where’s my high dose people at?,"they both have the same ratio of D:L isomers of amphetamine! so both mydayis and adderall have the same chemical composition, just varying duration of action!"
Where’s my high dose people at?,I take 70 mg and have minimal side effects. Do you think 100 mg Vyvanse is safe?
Where’s my high dose people at?,Recommended max for adderall as per FDA guidelines has stood at 40mg (60mg for severe) for quite some time now
Where’s my high dose people at?,"loss of appetite, extreme dry mouth, light headedness, and erratic heartbeat"
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I was cool as a cucumber and relaxed mentally, but my body was way out of wack"
Where’s my high dose people at?,I’m trying a week without the Strattera to see if I notice a difference or not. It’s been two days and so far I don’t really notice anything. They processed my results but I haven’t seen them yet. I will tell you that I had some bad side effects when I started it last year about two weeks in & they lasted about two weeks. I almost gave up but one day it just started working. I hope it helps & that you don’t have any side effects!
Where’s my high dose people at?,Perhaps go to a specialist psych nurse prescriber and try some totally new angles.  This doesn’t sound like it’s working for you!
Where’s my high dose people at?,I am but I’m on BC so I don’t ovulate as far as I know. There def are days it works differently tho
Where’s my high dose people at?,"Well, I hope you're successful with your current dose!"
Where’s my high dose people at?,I pretty much take 20mg every 4 hours. I’m usually only awake 10-12 hours at a time
Where’s my high dose people at?,I'm on 60mg Vyvanse with no booster because Adderall makes me crazy 😭
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I feel like they changed the formula jr something. My adds used to hit so hard and I’d be up and moving all day doing work, and that night I’d have trouble going to sleep. Now it feels like I get 30 min to one hour of motivation and then I can take a nap. It’s so strange…"
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I actually get up and take it, then go back to bed for an hour or so.  I have my cats to thank for this. Their feeding time works perfectly for this schedule."
Where’s my high dose people at?,I take mine at 4am when i feed my dogs so its working by the time my wife gets up for work. At 530 am.  I was on conserta and it didnt have any effect on me at any dose.  Im not sure what booster im getting but i hope it works. Even the vyvanse has minimal effect. Its better then nothing but im still a scattered mess.
Where’s my high dose people at?,In the past couple years I experienced this symptom where I am talking and I have to pause because I can’t remember the right word. Sometimes is as simple as the name of the person I am with. A person I had work for a year now I can’t recall his name. Is that a symptom of ADHD? Got me really worrying about what I am taking taking 20mg aderoll rx.
Where’s my high dose people at?,"Yo! This has been by far the most distressing side effect for me. It’s fucking horrible, and I work in a field that demands a lot of communication. Does this reduce if you’re off it? And do you take vyvanse or adderall? This was worse on vyvanse, but still my train of thought while talking just disappears. I’m trying to build solidarity around this, bc it’s awful would like to figure it out. I’m leaning toward dropping stimulants all together but the pros are life changing."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"To clarify, are you saying your memory got worse since taking them, or worse when you went off them?"
Where’s my high dose people at?,"Same, since 2007 here too, that's crazy! 

Have to run an errand but JUST saw this (sorry!) and will get back with you in a bit! 

So, in the meantime - What were you like before being medicated? 🙃"
Where’s my high dose people at?,"My doc said ""adderall is stressful on the body"". I wanted to say ""you know what else is stressful? Stress!"" Just desperately trying to get titrated up to a therapeutic dose (I'm on 10mg extended release once a day, it's not enough)"
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I agree with you. Sadly, I can’t get my doctor to go past the “FDA limit.” Since I also have high blood pressure, albeit controlled with medicine, he adds that to the reason to not take the risk. I know that the limited dosage I am permitted is leaving me limited in my daily ability to function. It’s better than being unmedicated by far, but I know that another 20 mg or something a day would make me “normal.” Getting to be fully functional would greatly help my depression and other issues."
Where’s my high dose people at?,Primarily Inattentive. I typically use ADHD-D.
Where’s my high dose people at?,"Your content breaks **Rule 6**.

Claiming that ADHD is a superpower, offers positives/gifts, or is only harmful because of ""society"" is dangerous and demoralizing. 
It erases the experiences of most people with ADHD and ignores scientific evidence. 

**Please don't do it.**

There's no credible scientific evidence to suggest that ADHD imparts any definitively positive abilities or traits, and the negative consequences of framing ADHD as some kind of giftedness or special ability far outweigh any benefits.

Where’s my high dose people at?,"Gotcha yeah medicine is so hard to figure out 😭 I already went through this with my anxiety, depression, and OCD. Now I’m doing it again with ADHD lol"
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I feel like anxiety is a U-shaped curve with stimulants. It starts going down as you approach your body’s preferred dose, but then starts going back up as you exceed it."
Where’s my high dose people at?,I’m not taking any antidepressants currently. Are bladder issues a common or known side effect for antidepressants?
Where’s my high dose people at?,I started at 18 and slowly worked my way up to 54
Where’s my high dose people at?,"Yeah mydayis just sends out more pules compared to a normal Amphetamine extended. I just recently got diagnosed within the last 2 months. Since I tested in the 99% percentile of all patients ( I think I might be high functioning autistic as well but that’s a whole different can of worms) they’ve been quick to put me on a heavy long dosage, Mydayis is honestly the best so far but I need to time the half life so I know when I’m going to get any thought of sleep"
Where’s my high dose people at?,Sounds like their doc is getting paid to push this medicine and they don't know exactly who it's for or how it works.
Where’s my high dose people at?,Thanks! Hope you figure out something that feels more sustainable
Where’s my high dose people at?,[removed]
Where’s my high dose people at?,Ah yeah if you can't take an adderall booster then idk what to tell ya lol. Idk if 70mg will eliminate the lull or not. I feel like it's just there with the medicine. The bump also helps me not crash hard at night as well.
Where’s my high dose people at?,Sounds like tolerance to me
Where’s my high dose people at?,You guys interrupt your sleep to feed your pets? They can't wait an hour or two until your actual wakeup time to chow down? Wat da!?
Where’s my high dose people at?,My plan is to drop stimulants. I don’t want to keep increasing the doses. I started 5mg now 20 only works for 4-5 hours. If I take more I can’t sleep. And not sleeping make things worse. I am trying to increase exercise and meditation as seems to work. Working in strategies like lists and alarms to control forgetfulness. At the beginning aderoll was helping but now I am not sure. If this speech impediment it’s a side effect I wonder what it’s next.
Where’s my high dose people at?,"Always been a little clumsy, but I was much more athletic then. But I was also a teenager who played sports and now I’m a mid-30s mom of two toddlers, so I don’t think the adderall is the biggest factor in my increased clumsiness!"

Where’s my high dose people at?,"Similar story here. Haven’t tried Mydayis but even with Vyvanse being very effective I’m legitimately looking into ASD as both run in my family and it would explain some of my other symptoms as well as why treating my ADHD seems to make other symptoms worse (possibly the ASD symptoms). Only diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Depression, and most recently last year at 31 years old, ADHD. "
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I think it’s dumber than that. Adam, oxygen is no longer sold as a brand-name drug. Eli Lilly stop producing as I heard. Doctors just keep ratcheting up the dosage if somethings not working.

It’s important to tell the doctors it’s just not working."

I get sleepy on 20 mg Medikinet (basically Ritalin with a different release mechanism and timing). My psychiatrist wants me to increase my dosage slowly over the next month and at the moment I just live with my adhd symptoms and the sleepiness until I can increase my dose…"
Where’s my high dose people at?,"Im on 50 mg vyavanse(long release) + 25 mg dex (short release) to top off after vyavanse wears off(roughly after 7 hours, less if I haven’t slept much).

Where’s my high dose people at?,Curious if you still take adderall in the day time? I tend to fall asleep when my instants are wearing off but if I take an XR at night or meds at night I’m wide awake (and naturally) but super tired usually in the day

Where’s my high dose people at?,"I (ASD/ADHD-PI) got super fatigued/inertia struggles on extended release up till 54mg (went from 27 > 36 > 54 over 1.5 month time, 2 weeks each). I had so much trouble functioning on that I'd rather not take the meds, but on 54mg I don't have the inertia/fatigue at all and can actually do things. I *did* always respond super sensitive to other non-adhd medications so needing a higher dose was a surprise for me in that regard. Best of luck to ya with that."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"I take Vyvanse in the morning now, but took Adderall XR in the morning before ( along with the evening dose). 

I don't get super sleepy taking the evening dose, but having my brain slow it's roll is very helpful to me getting asleep and staying asleep. 

I do also get sleepy a bit sometimes in the afternoon when my vyvanse starts to wane."
Where’s my high dose people at?,"Yes! I'm not sure if you knew, but Adderall is basically a diuretic. It's not of that class, but it acts as one - notice the dry mouth? It basically inhibits production of saliva, and the stimulant aspect causes your kidneys to increase in function, which in turn makes you have to pee frequently, which is why it's so important you stay hydrated the entire time. It's like drinking a magnesium citrate and it pulls all the water out from your intestines, giving you the runs. Super super important to prevent dehydration and prevent electrolyte balance!"
Where’s my high dose people at?,"That’s alright, that’s partially why my dose is so high"

Crying when Dexedrine wears off ,"Unfortunately this is a part of the crash. 

This used to happen to me and it would always happen when I'm in the shower before I hit the bed.

And so there I'd be, shampooing and suddenly I would just feel irrationally upset or guilty about nothing. like 'Man I wish I spent more time with my cats today'.

Anyway, it hasn't happened in a long time and it might be because for the past couple months I've been really dedicated to making sure I eat and hydrate. 

I've also been ending my nights with a Liquid IV that I mix with my water for vitamins and minerals. (lemon-lime flavor) Delicious and really eases the crash."
Crying when Dexedrine wears off ,"i also feel very sad as it’s wearing off and start crying for no reason but tbh as rough as it sounds i think you should just try to deal with it if you can, if you’re on dex i assume you have already tried a few other meds and this is the best one. for me the benefits heavily outweigh a couple hours of depression and silver lining, it’s kind of easier to fall asleep that way, when i was on adderall i didn’t have a crash, i felt it wear off but i just felt normal after so in a way i sort of prefer having a crash so that im actually tired or bored enough to go to sleep"
Crying when Dexedrine wears off ,I take wellbutrin also. No stim crash. I am diagnosed with depression and ADHD.

Vyvanse vs Dexedrine,It sounds like you have a lot going on health wise. I think it sounds like vyvanse isn't working well for you so you should try the alternative your health professionals have recommended
Vyvanse vs Dexedrine,"That sounds wise. It'll take me a week or more to get Dexedrine because it has to be ordered, so I'll do some more research in the meantime. It's basically the last choice for me with regard to stimulants, because Ritalin was just pure anxiety far beyond anything Vyvanse has ever caused. It's possible I might just need an antidepressant with it, as it worked perfectly two years ago when I was still taking an SNRI, but SNRIs can worsen epilepsy and they always cause a huge number of side effects for me."

dextroamphetamine (generic Adderall) vs Dexedrine? ,"I have been using Dexedrine for about 20 years. Last year a new psychiatrist changed me to Adderall. 

I struggled for a month at work and finally ended up with a crisis appointment.  The crisis psychiatrist told me they should not have switched me to Adderall and such a low dosage. This was during the shortage so the other psychiatrist was probably trying to get me something. But it was such a low dosage that caused me to quickly spiral down fast.

I’m back to my Dexedrine and doing great at work again."
dextroamphetamine (generic Adderall) vs Dexedrine? ,Dextroamphetamine is generic dexedrine not adderall.
dextroamphetamine (generic Adderall) vs Dexedrine? ,Dextroamphetamine is NOT Adderall and “Dexadrine”is a brand. Adderall is a combination of 4 different amphetamine salts whereas Dex is the pure form.
dextroamphetamine (generic Adderall) vs Dexedrine? ,Have you tried Concerta?
dextroamphetamine (generic Adderall) vs Dexedrine? ,"Can I ask what your adderall and Dexedrine dosages are? 

Other than the adderall dosage being wrong , what do you notice the difference is between the two ? Anything in particular that Dexedrine does that adderall doesn’t for you ?"
dextroamphetamine (generic Adderall) vs Dexedrine? ,"I think it's encouraging that you took this for 20 years and didn't end up maxing out the dose and having no more effects. I'm always scared of that happening. I'm 26 and at the beginning of my career, feeling like Adderall isn't working anymore. Thanks for sharing :)"
dextroamphetamine (generic Adderall) vs Dexedrine? ,"Yes sir, but re-read his comment, it says Dextroamphetamine — Amphetamine.

I understand your comment completely tbh, the way it’s formulated makes it look like just Dextroamphetamine."
dextroamphetamine (generic Adderall) vs Dexedrine? ,[removed]
dextroamphetamine (generic Adderall) vs Dexedrine? ,"No, that’s not one of the options he offered me"
dextroamphetamine (generic Adderall) vs Dexedrine? ,"I’m up to the maximum of 60mg, 30 twice a day Dexedrine. I was on 30mg twice a day with Adderall.

I gradually increased Dexedrine dosage through the years. I don’t really get the full effects anymore since I’ve been on it for so many years. It was a big life changing event when I started it! I’m retiring in 5 months so I’ll be reducing dosages to an as needed basis."
dextroamphetamine (generic Adderall) vs Dexedrine? ,It definitely doesn’t work as well as it did years ago but it still helps. I think part of this is my commitment to build routines in my life so I can usually go through my routines during the day. I work in I.T. So my day can have a lot of interruptions and emergencies that I have to stop what I’m doing. I’ve gotten a lot better at being able to continue after interruptions.
dextroamphetamine (generic Adderall) vs Dexedrine? ,You would need to ask for it.  Concerta has a longer sustained peak of performance vs Ritalin.
dextroamphetamine (generic Adderall) vs Dexedrine? ,Ok! Thats what I’m on with Adderall currently and what I’ll be on with Dexedrine. I contacted my doctor and I’m going to try it this month.
dextroamphetamine (generic Adderall) vs Dexedrine? ,Concerta is shit
dextroamphetamine (generic Adderall) vs Dexedrine? ,Good luck. The Adderall dosage was too low for me. I didn’t realize this and went almost a month of spiraling down to where it was almost impossible to get anything done at work.

"Starting dexedrine and my blood pressure is high, will it go down? Does your body get used to this? ","I work at a psychiatrist. When you say high. How high? Because if it is like above 150/100 you need to tell the doctor and go get cardiac clearance before taking it. You need to get a ekg.


We do this for every kid before we give the meds. With adults we dont but we always say if you have side effects let us know. 


If it is slight, it will resolve on its one.


Dont take this as medical advice. Im not a provider.


Get your liver function checked if you really think that."
"Starting dexedrine and my blood pressure is high, will it go down? Does your body get used to this? ","It is currently at 140/90 and I am sitting in my office chair doing nothing. My normal bp is closer to 120/70. I have to avoid salt completely because that would make it unbearable. 

Is this something that levels out typically? I am getting liver testing done tomorrow."
"Starting dexedrine and my blood pressure is high, will it go down? Does your body get used to this? ",It just depends. Since it is that mild. I might let it go for 2weeks to a month. Make sure you never miss a dose.  I bet it chills out. If not try lower dose. You might be sensitive to it.
"Starting dexedrine and my blood pressure is high, will it go down? Does your body get used to this? ",Thanks for the reply. I'm currently on the lowest dose possible (5mg). I will try it for a bit more and regularly check my BP. I'm scared to eat because I fear that it will raise my BP too high and make me dizzy.
I had a really paradoxical yet sorta good effect from Dexedrine and idk why,"Hi /u/Disapointing_Son and thanks for posting on /r/ADHD!

I had a really paradoxical yet sorta good effect from Dexedrine and idk why,"Yeah dexedrine affects the gut so that could be part of it.

But also stomach and digestive problems can be the result of stress or anxiety. Medication reduces stress and anxiety for a lot of people with ADHD, so that could be why you feel better."

Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Yep, I hear this a lot. I lost my sweet tooth and my caffeine addiction basically overnight after I started meds. Turns out I didn’t love them as much as I thought, my brain was just chasing dopamine."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"###My occasional repeated ADHD public service announcement.

*Most strongly associated with ADHD were alcohol-related liver disease, sleep disorders, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), epilepsy, fatty liver disease and obesity. ADHD was also linked to a slightly increased risk of cardiovascular disease, Parkinson's disease and dementia.*

We as a population subset have a much higher risk of developing chronic liver disease due to alcohol abuse. So if you are young, please be aware of this. Our brains really like the feedback that we get from alcohol. 

[Link to the study](https://myhealth.ucsd.edu/6,1653690322#:~:text=Most%20strongly%20associated%20with%20ADHD,disease%2C%20Parkinson's%20disease%20and%20dementia.)"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Yess!! I was constantly chasing dopamine quick fixes by eating, drinking, smoking etc. Once i started meds i quit drinking and smoking completely."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Yeah my taste in alcohol has changed too. I still enjoy having a few drinks (or even too many) but it's a different kind of desire. It's more like ""I want to have a drink because it will be fun"" rather than a craving for some relief via the dopamine hit."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"My decades-long caffeine addiction disappeared overnight, without the headache. I have maybe 1 or 2 cups a month now rather than 3+ a day. 

My craving for booze and sugar has almost stopped. This is my first summer being medicated and I have very little interest in drinking like I usually do during the hot months. Sweets are few and far in-between. 

I was hoping it would help me quit nicotine but sadly it hasn't. Been trying to kick this habit for so long. I vape and have reduced my nic but I still chain vape. 

It's been really neat to see how much I was self medicating."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,[removed]
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,I don’t really drink but I emotionally eat. I no longer eat when I’m bored. I eat when my body tells me it’s hungry
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,Congrats! I’m four years sober and it’s definitely A LOT easier now that I’m on Vyv. My broken habit is that I stopped picking/biting my nails for the first time in my life. I have long nails now. It’s amazing and so unexpected.
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,Had that happen for a few months then I started drinking even more since it gives extra euphoria on meds… sigh
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,I used to crave alcohol and got treatment for the addiction.  Then I started taking ADHD meds.  I have no more alcohol cravings or any desire to drink.
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Same, but I still don't want water."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Ritalin made me want to drink, Tentin made me feel the same as you."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Same. I went from drinking 4 nights a week to once a week.

Then earlier this year I packed that in, too. I'll have a couple of beers when the occasion calls for it but there tends to be months in between said occasions.

I only really get cravings when my meds wear off, but thankfully that's last thing at night and too late to do anything about it."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,I feel the same way with weed and caffeine anddd sugar. It’s been life changing
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Yep, that is a common positive  effect when people with adhd are medicated! It’s due to low dopamine production if your not taking meds your mind constantly seeking something out long story short"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,Me too . I used to drink to pump me up to go and socialise in the evenings hahaha now I never socialise .
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Yep! I'm 35, been a binge drinker (daily) since college. Got on meds a year ago and it literally stopped the same day. Now I drink a bit when I go out with friends every few weeks, but I could take it or leave most of the time. And I definitely don't think about it otherwise. No building habits, no internal struggles, just...done.

On the flip side, when the shortage has made me run out of meds for more than a few days, I do have to be careful not to drink at all because it opens that avenue back up--so a word of warning if you find yourself out of meds for a bit and don't want to slide back into drinking."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,Same thing happened for me with snacking. Lost 30 pounds just for sticking to my treatment.
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I did too and it probably saved my entire reputation. On the weekends I typically won’t take Vyvanse if I am planning on having fun, but then I struggle having the motivation getting ready to go out, etc."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I haven’t stopped completely since straterra but it’s absolutely 100% been less of a thing, not so much the default “well I’m bored and anxious” anymore, and not having “go to the liquor store” as a regular errand.

My doctor was super condescending and dismissive about even trying to get my diagnosis and I had to argue with him that his perception of my potential drinking (I’m a bartender, I’m around alcohol all day, I totally see how dumb it makes people) was not why I had these issues"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I am in a similar boat. Got drunk a few times a month, enjoy a beer, but I really hate all the negative side effects of alcohol.(it ruins two days after for me + plus all the negative thoughts when drunk) Ever since I started on ritalin a month ago, I've  only drunk non alcoholic beers. I've wanted to go non-alcoholic for years but never had the executive function"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I take Vyvanse and don't really drink at all anymore. It just doesn't do what it used to and isn't really that much fun or enjoyable. I've also noticed that it exacerbates my ADHD. Even a beer while making dinner leaves me slightly addled, making the process more difficult. On top of that, because I often sleep less than I should, I find my sleep-debt comes for me when I drink and I start feeling drowsy pretty quickly. 

Getting older (50) I've become more conscious of my health and stepping back from booze has allowed me to appreciate how physiologically poisonous it is.  All in all, I don't miss it - especially hangovers.

Edit: missing word"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I stopped nicotine, energy drinks and sugary food."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,I can relate. Only thing I cannot stop is smoking. That instant rush and sharpness after smoking is so freaking good.
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,I'm still chasing dopamine.  Maybe I need a higher dose.
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,I relate to this exact experience. Was never a heavy drinker - but a moderate/regular drinker. Started Vyvanse in April and and have had alcohol once since and it’s not even challenging or tempting
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Me too.

&#x200B;

I think this is a self medication issue since alcohol releases dopamine into the brain. With the medication we don't need it anymore.

&#x200B;

I'm still drinking occasionally, but nowhere near the amount I used to."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I completely quit alcohol pretty much the day I started vyvanse and I've probably had like two drinks since but neither one was ""I wanted a drink"".

One was a buddies wedding at a toast. 

One was just seeing a friend I hadn't in a long time and he offered. 

So basically both were to signify an event. Like you said, I wasn't against them per se but I really like being sober and medicated.

Edit: Should say: I still drink a lot of caffeine and still have a sweet tooth even if it's much more reasonable on meds."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"This is exactly what happened to me as well, been on Vyvanse for a few months now. I’ve probably gotten drunk (from ~9-12 drinks) a very high majority of every Friday and Saturday night since I was 17. I never felt addicted, I could always refrain and stop if I wanted to, just never had a reason to. I always considered myself a social drinker or because I was bored, and boy does it make sense now as to why I always wanted to drink because I was feeling so bored. Once I started Vyvanse, I had zero desire to drink and completely quit. My wife was thrilled that even though the prescription is $60 per month for Vyvanse, alcohol was probably $300+ a month when you factor in restaurants. I’ve also slowed way down on wanting to buy new video games and play them non stop.  Biggest side effect I’ve started to have currently in the heat of summer is being too focused on what I’m doing and not taking time to cool down and re-hydrate since I’ve noticed increased sweating from Vyvanse. Think my average water intake is currently about 1.5-2 gallons per day but is probably like 3-4 gallons when doing anything strenuous outside in the heat."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,Hmm maybe I should go back on meds…
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I realized that my alcoholism was largely a dopamine chase. I got diagnosed with ADHD at 4 years sober and it was like a lightbulb going off. Thankfully I didn’t want to drink anymore anyways, but that came with a lot of hard work over the last four years. I never knew how much dopamine I was chasing until being medicated makes me just sit and focus on one thing at a time and that thing is usually not food, drink, or excitement."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,This is common. Undiagnosed/Untreated ADHD drive addictions for a lot of people.
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I used to binge drink a lot more, and I was also reeeeally bad with snacking. I drive around for about half my work day and I’d be stopping for fast food all the time. Been on meds for over a year now and I still like to drink but I’m happy with stopping at 3-4, and I don’t drink as fast. I also really don’t like the sleepy, cloudy feeling of being very drunk, and vyvanse already makes me more comfortable in social settings that I don’t need alcohol as a social lubricant as much. 


My fast food consumption is still probably greater than most people (just because I forget to pack a lunch more often), but I’m more likely to stop at a grocery store, and I’m more likely to actually eat my packed lunch, and more likely to listen to the “we have food at home” voice."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I also stopped drinking when I started Vyvanse and haven’t been the slightest bit interested in it since even when I’ve been out with friends and everyone around me has been drinking.

I wouldn’t say that I had a problematic relationship with alcohol but I was a daily habitual drinker (ie. a couple of drinks after work and with dinner pretty much every day). Im 45 and have not had a break from alcohol like this in my entire adult life. 

I’m loving how much clearer and brighter I feel and how many hours I’ve gained in the day!!"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I’m an alcoholic, been to rehab many times, but this time I talked to the doctor about ADHD and how I think my addiction is linked to it. Alcoholism/addiction is common in people with it and medication helps, especially if started earlier in life so that the self medicating never starts. I’m in my 30’s, so I’ve been self medicating for a long time. I’m so happy to finally know why I am the way I am! I’m not broken or a failure, I’m ADHD and receiving treatment now ❤️"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I started taking Adderall about 3 weeks ago along with Zoloft. I used to drink a beer or two just to cope with my stress at work. Since taking the medication, I have almost lost the desire for alcohol! I even leave the second beer half way because my mind is “enough!!!”
But my desire and enjoyment from porn and masterbation (probably sex too) has skyrocketed.
I don’t over eat too!"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"You know what The same thing happened to me. I was in a bad situation when I started my meds so I wasn't able to really figure out how they affected me, but once I moved out into my own place I was finally able to see all of the benefits of my medication.

One of them was that I simply don't need coffee anymore. I used to have to drink two cups of coffee to get started during the day but now I take a small caffeine supplement just so that I don't get a headache and I've been cutting that down to smaller and smaller doses regularly. 

I still have my sweet tooth but I find it harder to not eat sweets at the end of the day once my medication has worn off. I guess I'm looking for something to fill in the last couple hours of me being up. 

Biggest bonus though is that I just don't need a drink coffee everyday. I drink a cup of green tea every other day and that's just because I like the flavor of brown rice green tea. 

Still working on that sugar addiction though."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,Me too! Isn’t it wonderful!
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,Yup!! Helps with all my addictive shit
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,I never had a desire to drink alcohol. I do remember my medication fact sheet saying to avoid alcohol with taking it though. I just don't like the taste of alcohol even without medication
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Same but with cigarettes. Been clean from the booze a year and a half already. Only started Vyvanse a few weeks ago. I smoked about 3 cigarettes after I started medication the first week and I was like: ""why the f am I doing this?"" And put it down.  The guilt had been building up already and I had planned on quitting again regardless. The meds just made it easier for me."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Drinking got boring for me while on meds because it increased my tolerance. I was the only one not running a roller coaster track at parties after 7 shots. 
Now I don’t drink much because of having kids but meds definitely interfere with the ability to enjoy a good buzz"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,Vyvanse is used to treat binge eating disorder. I imagine it could treat other dependencies/addictions the same way. It has to do with dopamine.
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Never been much of a drinker since I got sober, but as soon as I started meds I didn’t have a desire to vape, and I chose to quit because the lack of desire seemed like a good opportunity to take!"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,My coffee intake plummeted without me noticing at first when I started ADHD meds. It's interesting to discover what the function probably was.
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,I’m an alcoholic. The entire time I was drinking I was unmedicated. Maybe if I had tried to figure myself out before I was a full blown addict I could have avoided that dark period of my life. Oh well. Live and learn.
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Yes. I used to get drunk once or twice a week, then i started to really enjoy beer. Day one of medication i lost my craving for pretty much everything dopamine related like chocolate, energy drinks, nicotine, alcohol/beer and coffee.

Now when i have more money and less cravings i still enjoy a nice craft beer every now and then. Still adicted to snus though but i believe i got the willpower to quit with medication."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Same for me. I've been on vyvanse for about a year now, can't quite remember. And I've found that it completely killed my desire for alcohol and caffeine. 
I can have a beer now and again these days, but nowhere near as much as I used to. The desire to open one is less present, though more so when I am home for many days in a row with my smallest kid who asks too many questions and is so insistent on competing over everything. At the end of a long day with him, I'm inclined to have a glass."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"100% 🥲 coming out of the height of the pandemic, i was drinking a lot. started adderall in 2021 and it didn’t change anything, then switched to vyvanse in 2022 and practically lost the desire overnight! physically, it doesn’t make me feel good anymore, just anxious/sickly/overstimulated, and mentally i really don’t crave the experience anymore at all. occasionally i’ll have a beer because i was a ✨craft beer lesbian✨ in ye olde times, but it never hits the same lol… which is kinda sad bc i do miss the flavors 💀"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Yep 100%

 I’d have a glass of wine or two 2-4x a week on weeknights then a bottle on a Friday. Since being on Elvanse (UK brand of Vyvanse) I rarely drink at home anymore and only have a pint or two if I’m out somewhere.

Definitely self-medication"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,Yep I don’t drink at all anymore. I was absolutely self medicating.
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,Sobriety is fucking neat
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I’ve completely lost my desire to drink alcohol, and my desire for carbs has hugely gone down the drain. My sweet tooth is much lessened and I find I prefer fruit and veg now."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,Be very careful that the urges don’t start to appear as the medication wares off later on the evening
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Me too!  
Started Vyvanse a month ago also and my alcohol intake was similar as yours. I also noted a radical drop in my ethylic enthusiasm! It's coming back, though, but I find it easier to do without. I try to keep the beer and the wine for the weekend only, and I go for flavoured Perrier on the weekdays. 

I hope Vyvanse is making a nice difference in your life otherwise, not only about drinking! As for me, it's the best thing that happened in my life since so many years."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I told my doctor this too, as I was drinking more than I’d like to admit before starting Vyvanse. It didn’t completely take away the desire for me, but definitely turned the volume down and made it easy to have days without"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Can anyone else relate?

Me: 23 year old Male in College
Medication: Methylphenidate (Ritalin) 
- 10mg 4 hour
- 54mg XR (12-16hr)

     On most days that I take my medication, I do the following 

I avoid most social situations/talking to people, I have little energy to do anything, I am in a bad mood/irritable by little things… and most importantly, talking to girls is extremely difficult (only when im medicated)

As you could expect, being a college student… not being able to talk to girls because im still on medicine, is very problematic. The doctors always tell me “not to take it”, but I still need it when im not around girls beforehand.

Because of this, I try to combat the medication with the help of alcohol. If I was going on a date with a new girl, I would drink 2-3 beers before I could build myself up to my ‘normal, non-medicated’ self… Clearly, this is not a trend I want to continue. Can anybody relate?"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,Lost my sweet tooth but not alcohol. I’m a very anxious person and also have autism so it kinda spiralled. I like vyvanse but it honestly would work better without the alcohol.
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,I had the very same experience when I stared taking ritilin. I wasn’t a heavy drinker but would sometimes over indulge. Since starting ritilin I have no desire to drink at all. I’ve always wondered if this has happened to anyone else! I will take it though!
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"When I first started taking it I was less hungry. After a few weeks- a month I was back to normal… I wish that would have lasted. (I’m plus size)
Either way, I had to take multiple other meds that didn’t work well for me at all for adhd before vyvansse. It has worked so so well for me"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,Happened to me too… but the desire eventually came back at a slightly diminished level.
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,Wait yall drink on meds..
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,Good. Alcohol is nasty anyways.
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"It did....until it didn't. Now I still want a drink sometimes lol And if I do a tolerance breaks on weekends I sometimes binge eat, drink, etc. I hate it."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,Fix the dopamine. Fix the drinking.
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I still crave coffee during the afternoon Vyvanse crash, but I went from drinking every night to drinking a couple of drinks a week. I just don't crave it anymore. It still tastes good though."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Saaaame.  I have no urge to drink and while I do feel the lack of appetite somewhat, mostly I have the option not to indulge in food as another hit as well.  I have the option to NOT chase a distraction now and its so very wonderful"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I noticed the same thing as well. That being said, be careful if you ever have the need to stop taking your meds because the desire may come back (it did for me)."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,Same
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Same here, with caffeine, alcohol, thc... It all went away the moment I started medications. I still take coffee when I need to focus longer as meds are only affective 6 hours a day."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I have; I drank to make myself feel better at first, nothing, and for the most part, I occasionally drink."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"As a former alcoholic let me tell you something interesting.
Meds aren’t what got me off alcohol, but they’ve been a huge major player in what keeps me from touching it or other things to mess me up. During my alcoholic years….the few times I had meds were the only times I was sober."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Yes, I had this. I would say it's come back halfway. I can stop way more easily and feel satisfied."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,SAME for me
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,I'd hold off from making too many conclusions in the first 2-3 weeks on a stimulant. Great self-awareness and observation to follow up on though!
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,I was three years sober before I even had the capacity to think about myself enough to get therapy and get tested finally.  Imagine if I had been able to have the right support and meds as a kid.
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I knew my Wellbutrin was actually doing something when I stopped craving mountain dew 24/7. Bit different, but also self medicating. I do still drink mountain dew, but actually out of enjoyment. Too soon to tell of that craving will come back, but I kinda hope it doesn't."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,When I was on Adderall I basically stopped craving sweets all the time. Vyvanse doesn't work as well but it still helps quite a bit.
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I stopped drinking last September, then realised i might have ADHD in October. Still waiting for a diagnosis. Pretty sure I only drank for the dopamine. Same with sugary foods, binge watching TV, internet and social media. All a big hunt for dopamine. I believe it's called 'dopamining' . Great that your meds are helping. Gives me hope that they might help even out my cravings. How is your focus on them?"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,Pretty much.
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,Interesting. For me i it actually makes me crave alcohol
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,Big mood. As I’ve gotten older drinking has become less fun anyways without always thinking about drug interactions. I never ever drink except for a friend occasion once every blue moon. Or like now with a glass of wine while on my period because I have endometriosis lol
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Binge eating for me. At my worst, I was literally binging every lunchtime and then every time I came home from work. Just realised the other day that I can't even REMEMBER the last time I binged. AND the funny thing is that I'm still not even sure if the meds are working or not otherwise because I'm not feeling much of an effect, but that is one thing I have noticed."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I am the same. I don’t want sweets, and can eat relatively healthy on vyvanse. I also don’t crave alcohol. However I do still like my caffeine. 😄"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I still crave the dopamine from nicotine and alcohol unfortunately, but at least I wait till it wears off before I decide to drink anything and I’ve cut back my drinking more than before medication"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,Exact same here!
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,God I wish this was a thing for me. Cannot stop drinking :(
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,I AM A ALCHOHAULIC/former drug addict I started taking adderal XR totally quit drinking I have been drinking sense I was 14 years old sometimes every single day to point of black out I’ve lost Atleast 10 pounds from no beer I have mabye one or two beers a week now this shit saved my life I’ve struggled with addiction sense I was a teenager I’m almost 28 years old never thought I would quit drugs or alch  definitely a dopamine issue I’ve lost friends to drugs almost recently lost another to drinking on there list of medications they are perscribed always heard a bad stigma with adde now I’m doing better then ever I’m a totally different person I don’t take it to get high I’ve popped every pill that I could find for years and drank so much sometimes I wonder how the hell am I still alive I’m 5 years sober from weed and 2.5 years sober from cocaine don’t ever be afraid to try meds and don’t listen to bad influences even your own friends could get you into some really bad shit
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,That's AMAZING!
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,[removed]
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Stopped caffeine almost entirely and for me to get in the mood to drink now it takes a lot of effort. Would normally be 4+ drinks a night, now get bored as soon as I crack the second beer"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I don’t drink much after starting meds either. Whether I’ve taken any that day or not, it’s like 1 drink makes me extremely sleepy and ill tempered."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,I was an alcoholic and Vyvanse changed my life. Been sober going on 3 years now. Crazy how the right meds can change everything!
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"For me it was compulsive/binge eating, but mine has come back. Not sure if it's just the newness wearing off or a LOT of extra stressfule emotional crap I have going on right at the moment."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,I haven’t touched alcohol since vyvanse. Even the thought of it grosses me out at this point.
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,Since being on meds I have zero desire for cocaine. Go figure!
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I wish it worked for me 😭 I get the cravings later at night once my meds wear off so it’s not as bad, but it’s definitely still there. I have completely lost my sweet tooth though, which has been wild."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,[removed]
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I've been sober almost 3 years from booze now and as someone who goes to school to be a substance use counselor and clinical therapist I KNOW it sounds odd saying how ""easy"" it's been not drinking. But, it really has been. Alcohol was always my DOC. I was diagnosed when I was in 4th grade but was taken off meds after a while. Ever since I was medicated again as an adult in my 30s while attempting sobriety, it's just gone. Co-occuring disorders or co-occuring treatments are becoming more prevalent now also, just taking too damn long to become a norm or social standard. Majority of things are genetics, and nutritional. And FYI MDs get like zero of that, that's what you need a DO for. 

Sorry for the randomness. Late night stim from seeing this post. I thought I was even weirder than I already am by thinning that, but leave it to this community on reddit per usual 😅"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Same here, I asked if this was a common thing for meds in another sub the other day. 

I would almost drink every day, most weekends would be a lot. It wasn’t uncommon for me to rock up to work still drunk or hungover.

I can count on one hand how many times I’ve drank since being diagnosed just over a year ago and I haven’t been messy drunk like I would usually get, just have enjoyed a few and don’t like to feel too buzzed"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,If I take my meds it makes me want to drink more beer
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,i feel you bro. no longer addicted to marijuana! really feel like i wasted the last 3 years of my life on that drug
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"All the meds help me want to motivate to do other things and therefore have less interest in alcohol, but Concerta (Riddalin) is the one that really makes me not care about drinking at all. Except it’s the one that really gives me the most rebound (feeling agitated/tense). Generally I wanted to smoke more herb which I’m sort of cool with. Idk right now I’m on the Focalin bus, and it’s going pretty good but honestly I drink more than I’d like but it’s not too obscene. Lots of abstinence days and Infeel pretty good about it. But I kinda wanna try Concerta again with a non-stimulant, but I had to stop my Guanfacine with the Focalin because I swear it made me want to drink MORE. I helped me compartmentalize my thoughts but mellowed me out way too much and the Focalin didn’t balance it out so I think I felt like I was trapped. Hand me a drink please."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I’ve been on Ritalin for a month and a half, but my desire to drink and my appetite have remained the same. :/"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I’ve had a similar experience. I was into craft beer for a time like 12, 15 years ago and still enjoyed one from time to time in addition to a few go-to classic cocktails or wine or whiskey, etc. But I’ve found that I’ve enjoyed the sense of presence I feel with Vyvanse, and that alcohol detracts from it. Likewise, alcohol makes me tired.

This realization comes at the same time I’ve come to better understand the health impacts of even moderate alcohol use, and a close family member being affected by alcohol, and I more or less accidentally quit around Thanksgiving last year. Turns out that I feel that a lot of my drinking (which was usually pretty much in line with other partiers and was moreso just occasional or with dinner in later years) may have been a coping mechanism for various forms of social anxiety as well as just dealing with other symptoms, like for noise and distraction.

I did have a drink a few weeks ago at a work event, and don’t feel it “helped” me at all. I didn’t dislike it, but I prefer my feeling just on normal medication without alcohol. I do miss a lot of things I drank moreso only for the flavors.

So yes, I have what I feel are similar experiences to OP."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,[removed]
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,I could have written this post! Unlike you I did have an on and off binge drinking problem since my early 20s but since taking Vyvanse I’ve only drank once in the last 3 months! I no longer have the urge to drink wine on my days off and much prefer waking up feeling fresh.
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,Same here
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,[removed]
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Me too! I really struggled with booze and certain antidepressants made me crave it. Since having clear mind and focus, I don’t care for it at all! Stopped drinking in January, lost a tonne of weight and it’s good to be without that bad mental state of being mean to myself and others! 

Good for you! Best wishes"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I didn't know what it felt like to not be hungry until I started meds. Turns out that was my body needing dopamine. I still crave desserts especially at night when it's worn off, but that's because I forget to eat during the day now."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"It was the same for me. With medication, I just don't want to drink most of the time. I also enjoy it less when I do."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,It's sugar for me. And binge eating in general.
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I haven't had nearly as much caffeine or sweets since starting Strattera a month ago. I also drink more water now because dry mouth, so that probably helps."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,I have gone the opposite direction
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I had the same experience. I used to binge drink whenever I drank because I just kept drinking. After I started meds, I was at a social function, and it took me an hour to drink one drink because I didn't have any real desire to drink even though I was feeling overstimulated and awkward. (Which alcohol usually helped me stop feeling.)"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,Same on dextroamphetamine. I have one glass and I’m done. I used to binge drink in social contexts.I always could spend weeks without a drink always would need to drink in social contexts. This is now gone.
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"…this might explain why i no longer crave soda. I used to drink a loooot of diet soda and other drinks until I got on adhd medication. I literally suddenly stopped craving it. 
Usually it would take me 6-5 days to go through 4 liters of diet Dr. Pepper if I was sparing it, but its taken me MONTHS to go through the two bottles of it I had left!! My mini fridge is quite useless now!"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,Yep meds completely stopped my binge eating/craving sweets constantly. They are saving my life literally.
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I lost so much weight after starting Vyvanse because I just didn't get an appetite anymore. It honestly sucks all the fun out of eating, which is both good and bad."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,adhd meds drastically reduce my caffeine intake.
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"That's probably no bad thing!

You might find as you get used to the drugs and/or other things change you might fancy a drink but yeah it is interesting isn't it? F

Another interesting thing is that a lot of the effect we get from alcohol, particularly the first one, is psychological; ie you feel relaxed after that first sip despite it taking a few minutes for the alcohol to hit your bloodstream, and how drunk you feel can depend on how drunk you *want* to feel.\[1\] So without that ""I need to relax!"" urge being so strong you just don't need it. For me a lot of my general anxiety has reduced so I feel less of an urge to do the things that ""medicated"" it (eg I still like going for runs and bike rides but I no longer feel the strong urge to do it)

\[1\] this doesn't mean you can drink drive, silly!"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Great job! I find myself drinking much, much more to feel the alcohol buzz. Not healthy that way. Stimulant vs. depressant."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Be thankful I’d say!!! Alcohol and ADHD meds can be dangerous; alcohol speeds up the release of the drugs, which can lead to serious consequences such as heart arrhythmia and blackout. Some say that’s ok, the drugs out of my system by 6pm but with XR drugs that point is unclear, so dangerous. 

I have no desire to drink anymore either - mainly due to the above. ¼ glass of wine can put me in A&E. For me it’s a simple choice: meds or a drink? 🤷🏼‍♀️"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Yep, I get a major sweet tooth when my meds aren't providing me with enough dopamine.
A friend of mine with ADHD gulped down toffé syrup once just for the kick.
Byebye teeth."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Taking medication did not impact my desire to drink alcohol.  I already had no desire to do so, other then perhaps a single beer or maybe two at the annual work Christmas party at a bar."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,RemindMe! 6 hours
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I quit caffeine, drinking and smoking (& vaping) within the first couple weeks.

I drank a few beers when I went to a gig one of the days, and I smoked once but have no desire to continue w/that other than as a social thing.

I think it's exactly what you say, we're unaware that these things are basically dopamine crutches or, even if we were aware, it becomes far easier to drop them once we're getting our fix from somewhere else. Also conscious of the fact that stims affect my hr/bp so I want to avoid things that could also mess with that, and fortunately they make it easier to do so. Good job! :)"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,Fml I want a diagnosis and medication. The amount of unhealthy vices I have is ridiculous.
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I don’t feel this.

I’ve been on Xaggitin XL for about 8 months and I still have a desire to drink my daily 3 beers.

Maybe I was chasing the dopamine AND like it.


It is however easier to ignore the urge. But I’ve been a chronic week smoker for 14 years. My brain is all fucked anyway"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,Very much so! Same with sex. Chocolate habit is back every time I’m not medicated though 😂
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"It's annoying as hell! Like all of a sudden the things that I knew brought me joy no longer work. Like yes I'm functioning better, and I'm less Rollercoastery between rage, sadness, stress, and happy. But damn.. I just spent a week in the woods with my sister, parents, and 7 little girls and I couldn't even finish 1 drink."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,I started meds two years ago and have only drank a handful of times since. I lost the desire for it completely.
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,Same here really. Not sure why
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,Same. It was totally a regulation tool.
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Before I started my medication, I was partying and misusing all sorts of party drugs and, around 1-2 weeks, of medication (Methylphenidate then later Vyvanse) it was gone... My psychiatrist told me that it was further evidence of my ADHD and its relationship with dopamine deficiency!"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I used to binge eat, spend money and masturbate a lot (not at the same time 🤣), since I started Vyvanse I can say I got them to healthy levels. I'm losing weight, didn't spend money with useless stuff that I lose interest in days and OMG I'm not a pervert anymore."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I've had exactly the same thing, the difference is I'm a raging alcoholic 😅

I've had 3-4 pints over 6/7 hours twice since starting elvanse 4 months ago.

Before that I was 2 bottles of wine a night, usually with a joint and sometimes a line.

It's amazing what we do to try and self regulate/get a baseline level of dopamine. ADHD meds give you that baseline, that itch has gone and I don't feel like my brain is going to explode from boredom.

I didn't drink for the first 3 months at all and I've only dipped my toe in again recently because I'd had a really really bad week of ADHD symptoms and I needed a fucking break. But I was done after a few pints, just had a bit of a buzz, felt awful the next day after being sober for months.

I now like a pint or glass of wine when I go out with mates, but that's it. I'm usually down and out by 10pm and in bed. The new life sobriety has given me is 10000 times more important and I think ADHD meds saved my life"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I barely have drank since being on Vyvanse and if I do I will have 1-2 drinks and loose interest and not like thr taste and will have a moment in my brain like “ why is this necessary “ and i also crave a huge amount of water after a alcoholic beverage . I used to party drink every weekend before meds and this is a side effect I really like about this medication, i feel way healthier now."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,[removed]
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Same happened to me! Drinking cut down to half, maybe even 75% cut out.

Nicotine however… that increased lol."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,You’re in the honeymoon phase too so be mindful of that
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Definitely, I've lost weight mostly from not snacking at work. Self-medicating for a dopamine hit? Maybe. Cure for the boredom? Maybe. Whatever it was, it disappeared with medication."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I use to LOVE drinking before I was diagnosed. Everything about drinking whether it was just going around to a friends house who lives 10 minutes away in her backyard for cocktails or going out for a full night out of pre gaming, then dinner then multiple bars and dancing then getting home at 4am. I would almost always go overboard and not be able to stop drinking and get crazy then hate myself in the morning. However now I am on Vyvance I don’t have a desire to drink, while I have gotten mildly drunk a few times I didn’t enjoy it like I once did and I found I had a few got bored and stopped drinking. I think it’s due to the Vyvanse acting  the same way alcohol does for the brain. I’ve had a look online and due to people with ADHD having low dopamine they are much more likely to engage in risky behaviour such as binge drinking and drug use in order to get that hit"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I've noticed that I haven't had the urge to smoke weed anymore. I remember every evening I'd have to convince myself (usually couldn't, I give in very easily) and I'm just doing so well now that I don't feel like I have to smoke anymore. I mainly used marijuana to calm down and get to sleep, and now on meds I am able to do that without it and I feel great!"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I’m on Concerta 36mg. I honestly don’t care to drink, I just wanna workout, clean and work lol. Great drug to stay sober."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"yep. my obsession with chocolate was literally part of what i portrayed my personality to be, wouldve been one of the main points if i had to list details about myself, i'd literally eat like a half a bag of chocolate chips in a day while doing homework in high school

and then i got on meds and.... yeah chocolate's tasty, but i never actually crave it anymore"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I really hope this works for me too. I get along fine without meds but the more subtle issues hit me hard, especially binge eating and smoking/porn. 

Have a psych appt next week, hoping some vyvance can help me achieve some peace."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,Does it come back when you're unmedicated?
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"So even at the end of the day when the meds wear off, you still don't crave sugary stuff?

Just curious because I cant escape the sweet tooth once the meds stop doing their job.."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,Fuck me I am so jealous
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,I love caffeine so much and won’t stop. though the meds did reduce my daily intake from about 4 to maybe 1 cup a day.
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"This! I craved the dopamine it turns out. Although I’m still in early titration and past the first three days of a higher dose, once my body is used to it the cravings come back a bit. Apart from alcohol. I went to a party the other night and had two small glasses of champagne and a gin and tonic and felt AWFUL the next day. My alcohol tolerance has gone. Which destroyed any desire to even have one or two drinks."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Son of a nutcracker you’re right!! It’s the dopamine, I’m a dummy!! Lol"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,Very interesting
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,YES. 100%.
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I am not medicated but I know my sweet tooth is related. I snack or fight snacking a lot at work or when I try to stay focused on a movie and not go on the phone but if I am in holidays or enjoying the weekend I completely forgot to eat until I feel light headed. And I don't crave sugar when I don't have to do stuff, more proper meals."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Makes sense.  My dad also found out recently he has ADHD, and alcoholism is absolutely rampant in his family, I suspect my grandpa had ADHD too.  I read in the book ADHD 2.0 that people with ADHD live on average something like 13 year shorter than people without ADHD, owing to everything you mentioned plus more risk-taking leading to accidents, and depression and social isolation leading to suicide.

It's depressing stats, but also I'm 37 and was just diagnosed, so I've been fighting that all my life without know what kind of support I need, so now that I do I'm much more confident in my ability to get and stay healthy."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Fuck sakes, I really need to get medicated ASAP.

Lifelong obesity problems and been abusing alcohol for like 15 years."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I find that interesting. I regularly drink like an alcoholic, but don't feel like I'm addicted and can (and do) stop drinking for long periods of time with no issues normally associated with addiction, outside of the occasional mild hangover. Basically my thing is that i have a very hard time stopping once I've started, so just having a beer after work or something essentially means I'll be drinking all night, but i don't feel the need to drink the next day or anything. It's interesting that the dopamine thing seems to stave off certain aspects of addiction, like how certain adhd meds can be quite addictive to people who don't have adhd but those who have it regularly forget to take thier meds despite having been on the medication for years in many cases."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,Yep my grandad died an alcoholic alone on a bus. I suspect that’s where I get my adhd from. He was apparently the life of the party and loved singing and dancing. Not an angry alcoholic. So sad.
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,">fatty liver disease and obesity

My psychiatrist sent me to a cardiologist: *Et voilà*

And if it's not COPD, it's maybe lung cancer"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,It's *also* really bad for regular people!
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,I'm realizing now just how much time and energy I spend finding dopamine hits.  I'm snacking way less and spending less time scrolling endlessly through TikTok and instagram.
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Praying that when I eventually start meds I can kick this smoking habit then lol. I’ve been able to quit when I find a new interest and get stuck into it. I.e, started running and quit smoking overnight with literally no problem. Started again as soon as I got bored of running. I’ve had a few times like that since I started smoking like 5 years ago. Want to just quit so bad."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Only thing I'm still doing is smoking. I am not proud of it, but in the alertness I get from the medications, a cigarette feels even more euphoric than it did before."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,Can you drink while on the meds if you don't mind me asking or would you have to take a day off then before having drinks?
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"That's really surprising that you went from 300+mg of caffeine/day to zero without withdrawals. I relied on caffeine as self medication from age 10 until my early 20s. If I didn't drink it by noon daily, I'd get a skull splitting headache. Eventually weened down due to other health issues. Now that I'm on Vyvanse, I only drink caffeine on days I skip meds, otherwise it's decaf with breakfast."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I smoked two packs a day for the better part of 30 years of smoking, plus maybe 10 to 15 cups of coffee a day.

I _had_ to quit 10 years ago, and that's when my ADHD issues started getting gradually worse.

Now that I've started medication, my craving for coffee has gone way down, but not quite gone."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Man, I've had a 20 oz Red Bull at least twice a week for 10 years. Ever since vyvanse I don't even think about it. I have one Dr. Pepper in the morning and that's it. I'm a teacher so it will be interesting to see if I drink coffee when school starts again next month."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Which medication were you taking, Vyvanse?"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Same here. I sometimes miss the taste of energy drinks and energy/focus I'd get from them. But Vyvanse gave me caffeine sensitivity so even if I wanted to, I can't until it wears off in the evening. And if I do ill be up late. So I save coffee for nights I want to game late. 

I've never been much of a drinker though, even before my meds. But now I hardly have any interest."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"If you are taking Adderall, maybe check Dexedrine."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,Aren’t you not supposed to drink alcohol with ADHD meds? mixing alcohol with stimulants seems like a unilaterally bad idea
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Adderall and Ritalin made me irritable and uncomfortable. I will say the focus on adderall was laser-like. Time traveling in hyperfocus was startling. Have you considered lowering the dose or trying an extended release medication if you havent already? I initially started on Vyvanse but insurance changed their formulary list and it took me months until I got back on it. In that time I tried Adderall XR, Ritalin, and Concerta XR. They all had positives but I was uncomfortable with the mood swings. Alcohol made it better and worse. First drink or two would even it out but any more than that would rebound and make my mood tank."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,I’m looking forward to this.
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,I hope its the same effects on me
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,[removed]
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,Same
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"yes, unfortunately it increases my cravings for nicotine and caffeine sometimes.."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Try changing up the temp of water you drink. Also the cup, mug, glass you use. I found out a while back that warm water out of a thermos, between room temp and hot, not only went down easier but it also made my stomach feel better."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,congrats on reducing your drinking!
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"if  you don't mind me asking, are you on straterra only?  I think that's the one that you can't take and also take stims, correct?"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Have you tried nicotine patches or gum?  Curious how the feel now?

I'm an ex smoker, and used smoking more to keep my focus (but certainly there was a dopamine component).  I used patches to quit, but it certainly was not the same ritual as smoking.  

Now that I am a lot more aware of the effect of these chemicals on dopamine, I wonder if that would have made it easier to quit smoking."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"What med/dose are you on? Diet and exercise play a big role too. Protein breakfast makes my vyvanse operate at full effect. Sugary/carby/no breakfast makes it feel less effective.

Also life events are a factor. If you're stressing, your brain will want to counteract it with dopamine. I always crave alcohol and nicotine when life hits me with some bullshit, and I usually can say no."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,I'm on day 5 of Vyvanse and I'm already noticing this.  I'm 42 and very similar to your habitual drinking... It especially picked up during the pandemic bc I was so bored/coping

Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,My sweet carbs craving vanished overnight on meds. I lost 21k over a year. Miss a day? Straight back on the carbs craving - and I don’t even like 99% of sweet foods.
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Unfortunately yes. For me, the craving for alcohol also comes back when the dose is not right and the day was therefore again very exhausting. (Just switched from Ritalin LA/Adult to Vyvanse/Elvanse - i think i will try upping the dose from 30mg zu 50mg.)"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"For me, it about alcohol, but it feels like my brain is not immediately switch back to previous state after the meds wears off. Instead, it has sort of adapting back, so evenings are half good still for me. And even the next day is somewhat bearable if I forgot to buy another pack and have to wait. It is like meds get the brain into some state that lasts longer than the meds themselves. Without medication, this state is less powerful, but it is noticeably better than the normal condition of my brain."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"More or less, yeah. But I’m generally not wearing off until the late evening anyways, and I’m not much of a night eater to begin with. But I certainly feel the temptation more, the longer I’m off meds, without a doubt."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I have the same issue. During the day, my meds make me barely want to eat. Right at about 6 pm though, all I want is sweet stuff. I’ll eat my dinner too, but I’ve noticed I absolutely love sweet stuff now. Cookies, cake, chocolate, you name it. I don’t want to stuff my face with them, but I do notice that I’ll really want like a cookie or two when I get in from work, or like dessert after dinner. It’s really weird"

Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I've lost the desire to drink and over-eat as well. We went to the lake for the 4th of July and I realized when we came back I didn't even have one beer....which never happens.

Your comment also reminded me about the alcoholism on my mother's side of the family and they have the same restless tendencies I have."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,Yup I totally believe it. My mom is a severe alcoholic and I’ve been trying to convince her to get tested for adhd (both my bro and me have it). But she’s “scared of pills” 😒 shit doesn’t make sense…. She’s not scared of downing of fifth to herself in just a few hours but won’t take a fucking pill
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I also got diagnosed at 37, in 2018. Better late than never :)

However, I haven’t lost my desire for chocolate or alcohol. But I’ve only just started meds, and am on a low dosage (18mg) at the moment. I read that it’s really dangerous to drink while on Concerta, so I hope that when my dose goes up, I’ll lose the desire for it."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Just got diagnosed today, haven't started meds yet but should do next week. A lot of what your saying here resonates with me."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"*Disclaimer: I'm not a doctor. I just work in healthcare and have had my struggles with alcohol especially prior to getting medicated.*

Definitely see a doctor and make sure you are fully honest about your drinking. Everyone wants to downplay their consumption. They should check your kidney and liver function and make sure you are healthy enough to get medicated. This is not to mention the host of other things that chronic alcohol use does to the body. Intestinal problems, difficulties with absorption of medication and nutrients, inflammation, worsening mental health, weight gain are all things that can be affected.

You may also get diagnosed and treated for other things. I believe that article above states that 80% of people diagnosed with ADHD have a co-occurring psychiatric disorder. Things like bi-polar disorder, depression, anxiety, eating disorders, etc. can be a symptom of your ADHD or a separate issue. 

Alcohol makes us feel better at the time, at least sometimes it does. Some of us drink for the dopamine hit and it improves with medication. Some of us also have other issues like trauma that only exacerbates the addiction. Therapy and medication did wonders for me. I can't recommend therapy enough.

Hang in there and try to take care of yourself. I hope you find some assistance and get the right medication for yourself."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"There is such a thing as binge drinking disorder. These people may drink occasionally or just on the weekends. But, when they drink, they have trouble controlling their drinking. It can be dangerous just like chronic alcoholism. I would guess that it may be connected to impulse control that is part of ADHD, but that part is just my own theory."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"That's awful. So sorry to hear that. My grandfather had an alcohol problem, but it was the smoking that got him."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,I get so bored on the internet unless I’m doing something productive
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,Same here. It makes sense when you realize that Vyvanse is also used to treat binge eating. It's all about that dopamine reward!
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,[removed]
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,this post gave me a much needed dopamine rush
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,I'm not a doctor so don't take my word for it but I do not feel the need to take a day off before drinking. Usually my meds have mostly worn off by the time I'm having a drink but even during the day it's fine for me.
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,Caffeine is child’s play relative to these meds. There’s no reason to have caffeine.
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I was in tech for a couple decades and started drinking coffee in the AM at around 10/11. Uppers and caffeine are a pillar of IT culture. At my peak I was drinking probably 10-15 cups a day. Before started my Vyvanse I was down to one large french press every morning. If I went a day without coffee I'd get an incapacitating headache till I got some caffeine into me. 

When I started the Vyvanse I was worried about the withdrawal but it didn't happen. I also slept for 12 hours for the first week on vy though too. It was like my body was completely resetting. 

I'm thinking about trying to quit nicotine in the fall. Something tells me it will be easier too, I just have to do it."

Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"does being stressed cause your brain to sort of ""burn through"" the Adderall or Vyvanse more quickly ? For example if you were much more relaxed, would it last longer?"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,Totally agree - are you Australian by chance?

Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Does she think they'll lock her in a straightjacket and force pills down her throat???

My mother-in-law is an alcolholic and has periods of heavy binging - but it's obvious now given my wife's ADHD diagnosis that ADHD is the underlying cause for her desire to drink. I don't think she wants to face up to it; I mean, she's 70 now and I think she's given up wanting to face up to anything.

I would hope for her that knowing it was ADHD would help her forgive herself for all the shit she's put her family through and help her be a better Mum & Grandma. But I think she fears any reflection will force her to reflect on how bad she's been. (and she's been awful to her kids!)"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"In my case it isn't helped by the lack of red flags, like I've never shown up somewhere important drunk or drive drunk, never had any personality or temper/violence/abusing others type issues, never blacked out or done anything really stupid (beyond maybe taking a few too many shots late into a night of drinking), I've had a steady job for almost 25 years and been happily married throughout most of that time, so there's none of the stereotypical issues with alcoholism there that if i even admitted i might have a problem, it would get dismissed by most people."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,I socialize way more on drugs because I'm able to better manage my time and energy. I go out way more often with way more people and using way less effort. And I also quit drinking.

Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"That's good to hear, I suppose I'll find out myself shortly enough."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Same with nicotine. I smoke cigars all summer and then cold turkey for the winter.  Yeah I get some withdrawal but it’s a joke compared to vyvanse withdrawal where I basically have to sleep 12 hours a day and have zero energy for a month.

Although withdrawing from two cigars a day might not be quite as bad as what cigarette smokers deal with I suppose."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I'm not comparing them, I'm just speaking to the severity of caffeine withdrawal symptoms. After. Having tried multiple stimulant based meds, I know full well how they can be. I said in another comment that I can't do both on the same day, too much for me."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Holy shit dude, I thought my 2-4 cups was a lot. Also, work in IT/Engineering, so I feel ya on that go,go,go mentality. I'm trying to quit my vape that hit just a few times a day on my brief commute, picked it up when I started a new job in software. Been meaning to quit, hope we both can."

Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I had a lot of gut issues for a few years. During that time, I became intolerant to caffeine, nicotine, dairy, gluten, and weed. My immune system was kicked into overdrive and my gut lining was like Swiss cheese. After addressing dietary and lifestyle issues (go figure that nontraditional undergrad while working full time was unhealthy), I got much better. Could tolerate a cup of coffee in the morning, a toke in the evening, and most foods again. Maybe look into gut health if that seems like it's worth pursuing? Really changed the way my body processes food and now more recently medication."

Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I don't think so, though I'm not qualified to say I know with that much certainty. In my experience, the efficacy isn't tied to my mood beforehand. A good breakfast with protein, decent sleep the night before, and a day with fewer obstacles will likely help, but that's not always the case."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Ok, copy that... My vyvanse sometimes doesn't last more than 6 hours, so I was curious if you also quickly metabolized things?  I think vyvanse is supposed to last for like 12 hours or something, but it never does.."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,Came here to say this. I was concerned i had a porn addiction for a bit. Id be late for work for wanting to rub one out. In general if usually do it like 3 times a day or so. I started Vyvanse and i just dont want to. I still want to have sex with my wife but i just dont feel any kind of compulsion to masturbate anymore. Its apparently very common in men with adhd.
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,">Is there any way to check without medication?

Well, you most likely do have this because of the condition. It is just that medication might decrease the craving. Or not. I stopped wanting to get drunk, but I did not lose the sex desire in the slightest. And my craving for sweets decreased only slightly. I bet that there are people with all sort of combinations of what they stop wanting after medication and how big the effect is."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Well, as a counterpoint, I can say that Vyvanse makes me horny. Not hypersexual, but since I have less brain-fog and are better able to act on thoughts, I would say I masturbate more.

Alcohol, yes, that desire was reduced."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,I’m every day.
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Omg yes 100% I know that’s the reason my mom has a hard time quitting. That, and she needs to confront the trauma she’s endured herself (all consequences of her drinking).

And tbh she needs a fucking straight jacket sometimes. At least when she’s actively drinking 😅"

Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Cool, thank you for the insight.  I too find that a lack of sleep and not eating (or hydrating) can really put a damper on things.  I'm going to research to see if taking amino acids along with the stim help to make it more bio available.."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"I recently spent a couple months on meds consistently, then a couple months off them (thanks to our incredible medical system here in the US) and now I’m back on them. One of the strangest but most noticeable differences when I’m on meds is this. That desire is basically just not there!"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"hmm I still have this but not as much as before (ie I like to have a wank once a day but I can easily not if I'm busy!). Perhaps I would benefit from a slightly higher dose of El/Vyvanse, but at the moment that means more appointments with the expensive private psychologist....!"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"mmm maybe thats the reason why i keep drinking on the wekends, pffff i will try discussing this with my psych"
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Oof. I'm so sorry. I hope straterra works for you! It did wonders for me, but side effects interacted with an unrelated medical condition and kicked me off it. I've just started Wellbutrin, and it seems to be slightly less effective but still effective with none of the same side effects. Just another one to keep in mind in case it's helpful."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"While I can relate to the comments in this thread, I just want to say there is nothing wrong with wanting to wank once a day. I would say that’s pretty normal and unrelated to ADHD, especially if you sometimes don’t feel compelled to and/or it isn’t negatively affecting your life. If you otherwise feel “right”, I wouldn’t bother changing the meds. I’m not an expert though, by any means, so chat with your doctor. It’s just that once a day doesn’t sound excessive."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,Oh I wouldn't want to imply it was wrong! I just think an adult should be able to... not do it when he should be working.
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Exactly, it's becoming disruptive in my case, I think about it most of the time. By nature, my job is a bit frustrating, and when it hits, thats the first thing that comes to mind if the environment is appropriate."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Ok yeah, that’s what I meant by “as long as it isn’t negatively impacting your life”. I’ve been there when I WFH, it isn’t productive."
Since starting meds I've completely lost the desire to drink alcohol,"Aye, I would say it's like the difference between e.g. briefly thinking ""it would be nice to have a beer in the sun after work"" to spending all day thinking about that beer.

Dexedrine suddenly makes me painfully tired. Any ideas?,"Obviously talk to your doctor. That said...

How much sleep are you getting exactly? Some people think 6-7 hours is enough, but it really isn't, especially if you're exercising frequently and intensely - as it sounds like you are. Your sleep could also be poor quality, even if the number of hours is enough. Lots of things can cause that.

Maybe take a closer look at nutrition too. Vitamin D deficiency for example can cause mood issues and such. Also hydration is about more than just drinking water; maybe you need to drink gatorade at some point instead.

What about life circumstances? Stress - from work, interpersonal relationships, isolation, etc - can cause things like this. So can mood problems.

Also sometimes your body just starts reacting differently to the pills for no reason at all. I've experienced that."

Dexedrine only lasts an hour?,"Hmm, to be fair 5mg IR is more like 15mg XR, so you’re basically only taking half your previous dosage. That might just be too low for you.

On top of that you might also be sensitive to the rebound of an IR’s more rapid ascent and descent. It’s quite the rollercoaster."

Which central or latin american country legally allows Adderall / Dexedrine / Attentin ?,"You need to check the regulations of the country you are interested in going to.

Depending on the country and the specific substance, you may or may not be able to take it with you. Even if you are able to take it with you, some documentation that proves that you need it is almost always required, and you can only take a limited amount of it with you (say, a month's or two worth or so).

This is usually clearly stated in the customs website of whatever country you wish to go to, and you should definitely do your due diligence here, or you may run afoul of drug trafficking laws which are of course a big deal.

If you are going away for several months, it might be easier to try and bring as many documents as possible to try and have the medication prescribed by another doctor or clinic in the country you'll be going to. I actually did this in Mexico a while ago by taking a very official letter from my clinic here in the Netherlands. It was signed, sealed, and had clinic contact information. 

Trying to take a half a year supply of stimulants with you might be difficult both on the prescribing part, and on the customs part as well... so this shouldn't really be an option.

Good luck!"
Which central or latin american country legally allows Adderall / Dexedrine / Attentin ?,"That’s the issue though. I can’t just decide to go on an exchange somewhere without even knowing whether Adderall / Dexedrine is legal there, because I won’t be able to properly study then.

Experience switching from Vyvanse to dexedrine??,"Yep, I switched from Vyvanse to Dexedrine IR. I take it twice a day, 20 mg each dose (40 mg total daily). It's so much better than Vyvanse! I hated Vyvanse for all the reasons you mentioned. I don't have any of those problems with Dex. 

You'll probably need a higher dose eventually; 5 mg is basically a starter dose. So don't get discouraged if you feel like your current dose isn't doing much."
Experience switching from Vyvanse to dexedrine??,"I take 70mg because lower doses would wear off too soon. Even then, afternoons and evenings were a struggle.  My psych prescribed 5mg of dex to get through the late afternoon, but I found it a bit harsh and it seemed to make me irritable.

I've recently started splitting my 70mg Vyvanse capsule (dissolving it in 200ml of water) and having half on waking and the other half at midday. It seems to help with longevity.

Decent sleep and exercise in the morning also seems to get things rolling too. And matcha tea! It has less of a grating edge than coffee and is stimulating, but also relaxing. Too bad it tastes so horrible. 

A not too strong coffee in the afternoon is, however, inevitable."
Experience switching from Vyvanse to dexedrine??,"This was my experience with 40mg, sometimes evem weaeing off by 11am! When i went to 50 it lasts until 3 with strong focus and slowly tapers off. I take 5-20mg adderall as a booster around 2pm and 5pm most days since i have more going on i need to be ready for. It sounds to me like your dose isnt quite there where you need it to be yet."
Experience switching from Vyvanse to dexedrine??,- when I say feeling down that I may not have ADHD I don't by any means want it lol - just would be starting from scratch trying to figure out what's actually wrong with me. When I was diagnosed I felt relieved
Experience switching from Vyvanse to dexedrine??,For me I have experience specifically with both Dexedrine and Vyvanse. I was on Dexedrine but then I had some nausea issues with it. So I thought I'd try longer acting Vyvanse and it only lasted 5 hours! Dexedrine would last me all day and was more motivating for me. So I switched back to Dexedrine
Experience switching from Vyvanse to dexedrine??,Did you find it was same with 20mg and 30 too? I have had the exact same thing with all three. Take it at 7 and by like noon latest feel crappy. Super frustrating!
Experience switching from Vyvanse to dexedrine??,"5-20 mg adderall booster? does your
dr recommend you take it at your discretion?

I actualy under stand adderall over dex as the levo might help with any fatigue however 50mg Vyvanse + 20mg Adderall seems like a heavy dose if you take regularly"
Experience switching from Vyvanse to dexedrine??,"I tried vyvanse, and switched to dexedrine - it works a lot better for me too. The issues you had with vyvanse are due to your metabolism, not your ADHD, some people just metabolize drugs differently."
Experience switching from Vyvanse to dexedrine??,Weird usually it's the other way around! I've been on it since this post and it's been pretty good tbh. I'm up to 25mg now tho. I ran out and had to wait a week for an appointment to refill my prescription so I took Vyvanse I had left over for the meantime and it seemed to work better then it did prior which is odd!
Experience switching from Vyvanse to dexedrine??,"Yep i titrated up from 20mg, i cant say i ever felt crappy but they all ended up only working from about 10-12 after a week. Raising vyvanse dose makes it last longer mainly, and just makes the effects slightlybstronger. Some people have to go to 70mg before they get enough relief. Other things ive found for me personally that boost the effects of my meds:

Only use caffeine as a small booster when its wearing off ( half a soda or coffee)

Quit nicotine if youre a user

Sunlight and walking as early as possible 

Dont do highly dopaminergic things while waiting for it to kick in (endless scrolling, porn, anything else you find very pleasurable or that boosts dopamine too much for you)

Protein shake or similar meal with meds, small to medium meal when stims are at their peak

Weight training or cardio when they are wearing off 

High protein diet

Adderall booster has been a big one for me

Just some ideas that have helped me not get much of a comedown slump and make the effects more positive. Good luck friend!"
Experience switching from Vyvanse to dexedrine??,"Psych writes the 20s, i just dont always want to take all of it unless i have a lot going on because it can get me a little wired if i am not super busy. It is a reasonably high dose, i could lower it a bit to just cover my adhd symptoms but my psych and i are more concerned about my binge eating disorder and the dose needs to be pretty high for me to combat that. My heart rate has gone down 20bpm and ive lost 40 pounds in 6 months on this regimen while also recovering from complete burnout and bedridden depression so im gonna keep trusting the process"
Experience switching from Vyvanse to dexedrine??,"Currently Dexedrine made by Actavis however is total garbage. It's not real Dexedrine, I don't care what anyone says when I take it I feel spacey and unfocused so I called in Teva to do some testing. I honestly believe they won't do anything at all. Thing is I don't think the issue is with dextroamphetamine itself, but I feel like the manufacturers are not making it right cause it's just not what I remember dex to be.i get a spaced out feeling and intense nausea that lasts all day from the Actavis brand."
Experience switching from Vyvanse to dexedrine??,Thank you for that! Will definitely keep this information on hand!
Experience switching from Vyvanse to dexedrine??,So my generic capsules ran out at pharmacy but they can give brand name dex and I'm covered. And like what a world of difference the generic vs name brand is.
Experience switching from Vyvanse to dexedrine??,Ikr?
Experience switching from Vyvanse to dexedrine??,And what's up with the brand name dex having a full capsule and the genetic is like 75% empty 🤣
Experience switching from Vyvanse to dexedrine??,"Well the brand might have more filler not sure, but I've always noticed Actavis to have smaller pills than Paladin. I just assumed Actavis has less filler but the brand name Dexedrine still feels better."

Why is Dexedrine Not Approved Above 16+?,I'm in my 30s and just got prescribed it as well.
Why is Dexedrine Not Approved Above 16+?,I had no idea they wouldn't prescribe it to people age 16.   I do know that Dexedrine has a history of causing sudden death in kids and teens the risk is even higher if there is a potential underlying heart condition.  Perhaps that is the reason?
Why is Dexedrine Not Approved Above 16+?,"Most likely reason is because Dexedrine is old school. As in, it was one of the first prescription amphetamine formulations on the market and ADHD was really only a problem with kids so that is what early approval was aimed at. 
It was heavily marketed towards tired housewives and overweight people back in the 50s/60s/70s though."
Why is Dexedrine Not Approved Above 16+?,Vyvanse is dextro not levo
Why is Dexedrine Not Approved Above 16+?,You can’t just “logic” your way into FDA approval. If you want the drug approved for adult ADHD patients you need to conduct expensive studies in how the drug works in adults with ADHD. I assume the drug company didn’t think there was enough of a market. Now that it’s generic it’s especially unlikely that anyone would bother with the controlled studies since to prove it works.
Why is Dexedrine Not Approved Above 16+?,"I got elvanse without any issues (lisdexamphetaminedimesylate).
Not sure how much different it is with this lis- -dimesylate addition but it was as easy to get prescribed as concerta (methylphenidate)"
Why is Dexedrine Not Approved Above 16+?,I'm 22 and have just been prescribed dexedrine ir a month ago.
Why is Dexedrine Not Approved Above 16+?,"I think it’s only that it’s *recommended* for 16 and under, not that it’s not approved, which means doctors can still prescribe it to anyone older if they think it’s helpful. Even then, I don’t see why it would only be recommended for kids given that, as you already said, it’s in Adderal already. 

Oddly enough, on my Dextro script it says “Adderall” under common brands instead of Dexedrine."
Why is Dexedrine Not Approved Above 16+?,I had a prescription for dexedrine about a year or more ago at 24. Not sure but maybe what you read was incorrect? Very odd.
Why is Dexedrine Not Approved Above 16+?,Dexedrine is definatly approved for use in adults. Unfortunately its up to the prescriber to decide who is a good candidate. Some providers are less open to prescribing anything less popular or perceived abuse potential :-(
Why is Dexedrine Not Approved Above 16+?,Same here
Why is Dexedrine Not Approved Above 16+?,"That particular type of incident is not unique to Dexedrine, im pretty sure Adderall and Vyvanse have had incidents of similar nature?"
Why is Dexedrine Not Approved Above 16+?,"The FDA recommended age range for a medication particularly a stimulant like dextroamphetamine which has literally been used in adults for the better part of a century, really has no relationship to the ages of the people who doctors actually prescribe it to.  Before it was repurposed  for treating ADHD, Dexedrine had never even been marketed or prescribed as a drug that should be prescribed to children.  Some doctors simply will not prescribe Dexedrine to patients because it is much more potent than other ADHD medications and it is perceived as more readily abusable.  Despite the FDA recommended age range, it is likely that modern doctors would be more likely to prescribe Dexedrine to adults and less likely to prescribe it to children given that weaker stimulants called methylphenidates are typically used in children rather than amphetamines, although with the introduction of Vyvanse to the market this has changed but only because mg for mg Vyvanse is a much less potent preparation of dextroamphetamine than drugs like Adderall or Dexedrine.  If a doctor is going to going to prescribe dextroamphetamine to a child, they are going to do so in the form of Vyvanse which can’t be abused and only needs to be taken once a day.  In short Dexedrine is very unlikely to ever be used in children under 16, but it’s recommended dosing range hasn’t been updated for about four decades."
Why is Dexedrine Not Approved Above 16+?,Vyvanse is Levoamphetamine. Why do you think Dexedrine is called such? It’s dextro-amphetamine
Why is Dexedrine Not Approved Above 16+?,Thanks for contributing absolutely nothing…you seriously think I’m trying to get the FDA to approve this? You need to touch grass bro
Why is Dexedrine Not Approved Above 16+?,"There’s nothing different about it.  The (-dimesylate) is the “salt” from the periodic table that the lysdexamfetamine is bound to.  The same salt is used in Vyvanse. Elvanse and Vyvanse are the exact same drug produced by exactly the same company, they are just named differently according to global regions based off of marketing research that showed Elvanse was a more popular name than Vyvanse in some parts of the world."
Why is Dexedrine Not Approved Above 16+?,That’s interesting. My doctor said it was only recommended for youths under 16 years of age.
Why is Dexedrine Not Approved Above 16+?,Adderall contains about 75% dextroamphetamine
Why is Dexedrine Not Approved Above 16+?,"Oh maybe? I didn't realize that effect was across the board.  I have been taking Dexedrine for 32 years (before Vyvanse and Adderall were on the market).  I remember my Dr. warning me at age 19 about the instances of sudden death and to never take more than prescribed dosage.  He scared the crud out of me, to this day I won't double up my dose because of his warning."
Why is Dexedrine Not Approved Above 16+?,"They're both dextro...

VyvanseTM (lisdexamfetamine dimesylate)

""CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  
Mechanism of Action and Pharmacology  
Vyvanse is a pro-drug of dextroamphetamine. After oral administration, lisdexamfetamine dimesylate is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and converted to dextroamphetamine, which is responsible for the drug’s activity.""

&#x200B;

https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda\_docs/label/2007/021977lbl.pdf"
Why is Dexedrine Not Approved Above 16+?,"Vyvanse molecules are literally dextroamphetamine molecules with a lysine group attached to the molecule.  However for marketing reasons the molecule was named Lysdexamfetamine despite the fact that its chemical name should really by lysdextroamphetamine.  This was to avoid the negative social connotations that amphetamine has in our society.  Vyvanse has absolutely no levoamphetamine. Levoamphetamine is incapable of activating receptors in the brain and can only stimulate neurons in the peripheral nervous system, so if Vyvanse was pure levoamphetamine it would have absolutely no effect on ADHD symptoms whatsoever"
Why is Dexedrine Not Approved Above 16+?,"You literally asked why it wasn’t approved. 

You can possibly still get a doctor to prescribe it to you off-label. But not with that attitude."
Why is Dexedrine Not Approved Above 16+?,"Mate, you got an answer to your question. Why so shirty?"
Why is Dexedrine Not Approved Above 16+?,"My psych made no mention of it, but he did mention that he would have liked to start me on Adderall but didn't want to risk trying because he wasn't sure if it could even be filled."
Why is Dexedrine Not Approved Above 16+?,"Your doctor was trying to condition you not to abuse your Dexedrine or ask for a higher dosage. People are routinely prescribed much higher than the maximum reccomended daily dose of Dexedrine with no ill effects. The “instances of sudden death” are so rare that it is impossible to prove that it was not just a coincidence that those people died while they were taking Dexedrine. There is certainly no medical evidence that such deaths were dose related since it can’t even be proved they would not have happened if those people hadn’t been taking Dexedrine.  People experience sudden death from unknown cardiac conditions all the time.  Unless someone is taking ungodly doses of Dexedrine, caffeine is actually more likely to cause adverse cardiovascular events."

Amfexa/Dexedrine....help...best generic?,"I’ve been on generic Dexedrine for about 4 years now but have never tried the name brand version. In my experience, Mallinckrodt is very effective for me. The few times my normal pharmacy has run out and I had to get it filled elsewhere, I’ve had Actavis and hated it. I would feel it for like half an hour and then it felt like I hadn’t taken any meds at all that day."

What should I do about these (seemingly) ineffective dexedrine pills?,"I had the opposite happen. They swapped manufacturers on my focalin. I didn't think anything of it, I'd always been told it didn't matter because it's the same drug. 

It's not. 

I was shaking, I could NOT force food down, I didn't sleep for two days. On a 10mg IR. It was terrifying. My psych advised me to find out the manufacturer and my insurance could make a note that I do not get that type again, maybe you can do that. It worked for me, this month it was normal."
What should I do about these (seemingly) ineffective dexedrine pills?,"I got them at publix three days ago and it’s the first generic in over a decade that I’ve had a legitimate issue with. My stomach has been upset, feel super spaced out, hands are shaky, etc. I haven’t even wanted to take it the last two days."
What should I do about these (seemingly) ineffective dexedrine pills?,I'm having issues with my Adderall too and they are made by epic pharma.Theyre Horrible just horrible.i just get super nervous and barely any focus. Adderall has never made me feel like this ever.
What should I do about these (seemingly) ineffective dexedrine pills?,What happened with this? Having a similar issue.
What should I do about these (seemingly) ineffective dexedrine pills?,"Also, I'm not sure if this is something my psychiatrist would be able to do something about if I messaged her... Do I need to just wait until next month's appointment?"
What should I do about these (seemingly) ineffective dexedrine pills?,"When you say diamond do you actually mean triangle? Because mine are (5mg) white triangles right now. I usually take 10-15mg extended release every morning but I always have some backup immediate release tablets just in case. Ran out of the extended release and couldn’t get a refill yet, so I spent 2 weeks surviving on those triangle guys. 

I’m not sure if it’s this particular formula or the fact that I’m used to XR, but I just got my real meds again and reflecting on that time, it’s like I spent the last 2 weeks feeling like a chihuahua stuck under a blanket. 

So you could be onto something? They didn’t have the regular “kick” to them that I usually expect, and also seemed to cause me anxiety, which isn’t normally an issue for me with meds. I’ve had to survive on IR tablets a few times in the past and I don’t remember it being quite this bad"
What should I do about these (seemingly) ineffective dexedrine pills?,I took them for my sleeping disorder could still sleep after taking them but didn't have that I need sleep urge when taking them only thing I felt that sucked was the crash. Also think I was taking 30-40mg a day if I remember right. I'll have to look and see if I still have anything with the amount on it.  Also they were easy for me to quit after a few years on them like I said the crash sucked so I just ended up sleeping more.  Taking Adderall now but also don't like it there's no zip to wake me up. Just clears up the fog sometimes
What should I do about these (seemingly) ineffective dexedrine pills?,"I've had those before. They work but not that great. Wilshire (I believe Sandoz got bought out by them) is the mfr I've been getting for the past 6 months and I LOVE this mfr. I was on addy the first year and always had different experiences with each batch. Dex was a little better, but still could feel the differences between makers. This is the longest stretch that I've gotten consistent results and I hope it stays that way! Wilshire has definitely been the best hands down!!"
What should I do about these (seemingly) ineffective dexedrine pills?,"Yeah, if I was used to this Mallinckrodt stuff I probably would've had a similar reaction to the stronger Teva pills. I'm very inattentive with low energy/motivation usually so I need that kick.

I did some research and some binders like Cyclosporine increase the bioavailability of the actual drug by a significant amount. And different manufacturers of generics can have a 20% discrepancy in efficacy compared to brand name (which is absolutely nuts).

I might just try to get by with some extra caffeine this month or something and bring it up at my next appointment. :/"
What should I do about these (seemingly) ineffective dexedrine pills?,That's Horrible I hope u can figure y that happened had it happen yme before years ago Barr rand 20 mg were recalled they had way too much amphetamines in them ii think there's a lawsuit I should check it out soundsike alawsuit on your end
What should I do about these (seemingly) ineffective dexedrine pills?,"I’m glad someone can relate. 🥲 

Apparently they have had lawsuits against them before for quality issues. 

Couldn’t find a whole lot about dexedrine but the [reviews](https://www.drugs.com/answers/effect-mallinckrodt-generic-adderall-30mg-3381380.html) for their adderall generic are TERRIBLE. 

I’ve now had 3x my regular dose and it still feels like little more than sugar pills. I feel like going to sleep and it’s only 9pm 🙃"
What should I do about these (seemingly) ineffective dexedrine pills?,Mine are the same brand as yours and white but they are 20mg. I think they are labeled as octagon shape.

What should I do about these (seemingly) ineffective dexedrine pills?,"The 10mg ones from Mallinckrodt are diamond shaped: https://www.drugs.com/imprints/m-10-7135.html

What should I do about these (seemingly) ineffective dexedrine pills?,Mallinckrodt 10 mg dextroamphetamine tablets are diamond shape. Their 5 mg are triangular. I prefer Mallinckrodt IR dextroamphetamine over other generics. Its smoother.
What should I do about these (seemingly) ineffective dexedrine pills?,Tell me more about this “chihuahua under a blanket” feeling. I feel like you may be onto something with this epic metaphor!
What should I do about these (seemingly) ineffective dexedrine pills?,I totally agree with you and understand wtf you are going through sometimes cigarettes and a coke do more for me than my meds suck I want to get a chemist to test my pills I actually know one I miyask if she can see what is going on the generic Adderall stuff
What should I do about these (seemingly) ineffective dexedrine pills?,I did do a amphetamine test kit on a pill but it doesn't tell you what percentage you have in the pill of active ingredient and it'd be better to have a chemist test it for anything not right about e
What should I do about these (seemingly) ineffective dexedrine pills?,Fucking hell on earth I tested them w a test strips but still they're something screwed up about epic period point blank.msybe it's only like 15percent Adderall freaking foreign companies getting away with murder w ffs and FDA don't care they don't want anyone to have Adderall period plus tons of folks r complaining their ADHD meds r not working I e only been back on them fythree months was off a few years long time even plus Walmart where they came from are so antidrug everything
What should I do about these (seemingly) ineffective dexedrine pills?,"Dang. I’ve generally not had that issue with the XRs even when things switch up! I will say the first thing I thought when I got the refill of this kind was “damn, these fuckers are tiny” lol."

What should I do about these (seemingly) ineffective dexedrine pills?,"Omg that would not only be amazing, but you would literally be doing a legit incredible service for your fellow ADHD'ers here because im pretty damn sure i can say that we all would be so grateful because nobody from the system is helping us with ANY of this shit and its fucked up BECAUSE THEY ARE STILL MAKING MONEY FROM US while we freakn suffer in a million different ways!"
What should I do about these (seemingly) ineffective dexedrine pills?,Right? I thought it was Ritalin at first
What should I do about these (seemingly) ineffective dexedrine pills?,I tested it with some lab kit test strips but even though it was positive for amphetamine doesn't mean theres alot in it at all i need to ask my friend just not sure she can legit test how much is in it this month they gave me Adderall xr they feel almost worse
What should I do about these (seemingly) ineffective dexedrine pills?,"UGH I understand cuz same here,,the XR's didnt do jackshit either! They know, oh they freakn know what they are doing to millions of ppl with a freakn chronic neurological issue, and that, makes them damn evil. They dont give a shit about us or ANY kind of ppl, all they care about is their billionzzz of dollars."
What should I do about these (seemingly) ineffective dexedrine pills?,And also u can go to jail for murder for less time than most drug charges i mean wtf kind of country are we arent we supposed to rehabilitate non violent offenders?

Problems with Vyvanse/Dexedrine and excessive use of nicotine pouches/snus?,"Maybe try without the nicotine? If you’re like me you probably embraced nicotine as a form of self-medication due to its cognitive stimulant properties, maybe even long before your diagnosis, so maybe think about whether it’s worth replacing with a medically superior option? My psych’s advice was to limit caffeine and nicotine as their stimulating effects can compound with dex and lead to unwanted side effects. Just wake up on a lazy day and take a dex in bed and chill without nicotine for an hour or two, see how you feel 🤷‍♂️."
Problems with Vyvanse/Dexedrine and excessive use of nicotine pouches/snus?,It makes me vomit :(
Problems with Vyvanse/Dexedrine and excessive use of nicotine pouches/snus?,"Also, from personal experience, the negative side effects from my meds (jitters, mild anxiety, emotional fluctuations, restlessness) consistently decreased with daily usage and would return after taking break from meds. So I think well worth trying to stick with a routine for at least a couple of weeks before judging the meds."

Dexamphetamine (Dexedrine) and antidepressant (SSRI etc),I currently take both of those right now. I’ve been taking them for about two years together. I haven’t noticed any problems with my sleep or other symptoms. They actually helped regulate everything.
Dexamphetamine (Dexedrine) and antidepressant (SSRI etc),"I’ve taken a combo of lexapro (SSRI) and strattera (SNRI) with my ADHD meds (primarily Dexedrine or Adderall) for years without a problem. I’ve been placed on an SSRI twice, with and without dex/add. 

Starting &/or restarting the SSRI, in my experience, is definitely *not* a good feeling. Everyone is different, but it makes me feel “off”… kind of anxious, restless, aching… It’s hard to describe. Once the titration of the correct dose is complete, though, the side effects stop and I feel fine. The process takes me about three weeks. 

There’s a small chance that combining these two meds can result in something called serotonin syndrome, but if you’ve just started taking the SSRI, it’s most likely side effects that should go away. If your symptoms don’t improve in a week or two, you may need a dosage adjustment or a different SSRI. (If your symptoms get worse, call your doctor immediately.) 

I hope this helps and that you start feeling better soon! 🦋"
Dexamphetamine (Dexedrine) and antidepressant (SSRI etc),Really! Which ssri and what dose thanks so much
Dexamphetamine (Dexedrine) and antidepressant (SSRI etc),"Thank u so much! I also started lexapro with no issues now :)) but my ideal choice fluoxetine made my heart rate funny with Dexedrine , I wonder if it would go away after a while. Whilst I love lexapro as it gives me no bad effects with Dexedrine - I’m gaining weight already and not able to have sexual feelings haha"

Dexedrine spansules extended release ,50mg immediate release in one shot and you STILL don’t feel anything?!? Dang!!! That’s wild! I just got my prescription yesterday afternoon and took 20mg just a LITTLE too late and I’ve been up since!! What I have come to realize is everyone is so unique in how each of these medications affect them. What goes for one DEFINITELY does not go for all. What else have you tried? Stimulant wise?
Dexedrine spansules extended release ,I’m in the same boat! 30 mg spansule and feel no different. Although I do have a massive craving for wine gums (random I know). I can sleep and still have my regular appetite. Not sure what to do. I’m scared to try adderall bc I heard the come down is brutal…
Dexedrine spansules extended release ,"I also have just started Dexedrine extended release a few months ago as my pharmacy wanted me to try it out before approving mydayis. 
It took over 2 months to get it approved and in the meantime I had to try the Dexedrine. First month I was very disappointed but stuck with it and continued to titrate when psychiatrist felt necessary. I had eventually made it to 60 mg of extended release max and right when I was ready to  give up and pharmacy approved mydayis I had picked up the new script of the Dexedrine spansule and had released wait a minute I am feeling good ....cone to realize that Dexedrine does work and I actually love it but it depends on the manufacturer!!! Actavis brand was crap. It made me depressed and gave me anxiety and didn't work. There is a mallinkrodt white capsule manufacturer that actually works and sure enough I look at my capsules and when I was depressed and had major anxiety I was in the actavis brand and the other one seemed to be a bit smoother. I hope they would just start us all off with brand name first to see if meds work before trying generics."
Dexedrine spansules extended release ,do a search on the different brands and you will see how they affect others. There are consistant symptoms among most.

Generic Dexedrine IR vs ER?,I use ER Dexedrine (I think) and it works great for me.  I was on Vyvanse before and didn’t care for it for the same reasons you’re not enjoying Dexedrine- it was super swingy.  I’d get a really intense effect and then 8-10 hours later have a hard crash.  My Dexedrine feels like a very consistent effect.
Generic Dexedrine IR vs ER?,Do you know if you take the name brand Dexedrine spansule or just the generic?

Anyone not get more time out of Adderall XR or Dexedrine ER compared to IR versions?,"Generally yes for XR.  


I personally like XR because I don't need to be 100% all the time. It gives me a good 80% focus for 4-6 hours. Basically a gentle peak followed by a gentle decline.   


Meanwhile IR is like instant peak, followed by a pretty quick decline as well.   


My normal routine is:  
1. Morning time - 15XR  4 - 6 hours

2. Afternoon - 10IR if needed"
Anyone not get more time out of Adderall XR or Dexedrine ER compared to IR versions?,"Are you absolutely certain you're a rapid metabolizer? Which pathway? And how long had you been taking Dexedrine IR?

If your issues are really from metabolizing the drug too quickly, it's usually best to just try another drug. Unusual metabolism can change the effects of the drug, not just its concentration.

For your original question - those two aren't much different from taking 2 IR tablets ~ 3-4 hours apart. The second half of the XR is dependent on acidity, so... If you have an unnaturally low-acid stomach (taking antacids, proton pump inhibitors, etc), that can cause the whole XR dose to be dumped at once.

If you're 100% certain that you're a rapid metabolizer, and you won't consider anything besides dextroamphetamine, there's a transdermal patch (Xelstrym) if your insurance covers it. Otherwise, spacing doses throughout the day is the best way to handle it. (And you may have a better time spacing ER or vyvanse throughout the day instead of IR)"
Anyone not get more time out of Adderall XR or Dexedrine ER compared to IR versions?,Interesting. To me the IR lasts as long in terms of the sweet spot of symptom control.
Anyone not get more time out of Adderall XR or Dexedrine ER compared to IR versions?,"That’s odd from my understanding taking anti acids would actually make sure the beads are delayed release. But no I don’t take any H2 blockers or PPI’s  I’ve been on Dexedrine IR for about 9 months. Take weekends off and 7-10 day breaks every 2-3 months. I’ve not had any tests for 2d6 yet but I’d assume I’d have a rapid metabolism if it says 4-6 hours for an IR and that only lasts 3 hours tops. I’ve tried Intuniv, Atomoxetine, methylphenidate and dexmethylphenidate  in the past. None of those would last long. Methylphenidate especially makes me frustrated. Splitting 40mg of vyvanse in water 2 hours apart was Okay I’d only get 5 hours that way though."
Anyone not get more time out of Adderall XR or Dexedrine ER compared to IR versions?,I’d dream to be one of those people that get 10 hours out of 5mg of adderall😂

How in the world do you guys study?,"What helped me are:   
•Break down tasks into atypical smaller ones.   
•Exercise vigorously before studying or during studying (e.g. reading on a treadmill)

\*Someone from this sub once gave me advice to make an incredibly meticulous to-do list. E.g.

1. Open the book to page 58.
2. Study page \_\_
3. Memorize \_\_"
How in the world do you guys study?,"I got through university and a professional degree by:

1) Accepting that I would not be able to study in advance, and booking the 2-3 days immediately before my exam off to study for it.

2) Pomodoro timer method to get started on a task, and then ignore the timer when it came to breaks and just kept going.

3) Made sure my space was completely free of distractions, including using apps (Forest on my phone, Whitelist on my computer) to lock myself out of my phone and limit my internet access through my laptop to only those websites/apps I needed for studying. I also turned on Do Not Disturb on both laptop and phone to eliminate notifications. 

4) Played soundtrack music (without vocals) or brown noise at a low volume in the background. The LotR theatrical edition soundtrack was perfect because it was almost exactly three hours long. 

5) My little dog slept on my lap while I sat in my desk chair. You can’t just move a sleeping dog (that would be mean), and she usually got up every few hours to pee or drink water/eat, so we would both get up to use the bathroom at that time and get drinks, then when she was ready to get back to her nap 15 minutes later, I would get back to studying and she’d sleep on my lap again. Having her physically holding me to the chair was very helpful (and one of my favourite memories)."

How in the world do you guys study?,"Depends, do I like what I study? It was hell in highschool, it got better and better during the bachelor and master years and now it's even better since I'm on meds. 

I used to write everything by hand to learn something, organising it as much as possible. After that, just repeating. All of this done in idk 15-20 min followed by a smoke break without my phone or anything (maybe some background music). 

If I touch my phone, the focus is ruined."

How in the world do you guys study?,"The only way I could study was to write EVERYTHING down with pretty pens. I usually opened the slides the teacher used in class, and followed the topics with the textbook/other materials as I went through. I really wanted to rewrite the entire textbook too but I bargained with myself and settled on just rewriting the slides with some additional info if necessary. The diagrams were taking a lot of time so I saved up and bought a printer for those and pasted it on my notes where necessary. 

I'm not saying this is a good way to study, it's insanely inefficient but it was the only way that worked for me since just reading or listening doesn't make me memorize or understand stuff. When I try just reading, after reading a whole chapter I realize I didn't actually ""read"" anything, and if I really try to focus I just keep reading the same sentence over and over. 

And writing stuff down also creates something concrete that proves to my brain that I studied and obtained all that info, and after that its much easier to study by reading my own notes since I'm already familiar with the subject. 

As my classes got more intense and more computer focused, I changed this to creating my own slides, and it would be way faster than writing stuff down if I didn't get into creating my own diagrams and animating them too to visualize processes... But I made it through!"

How in the world do you guys study?,"Studying is not in my adhd vocabulary.

Things I learned to get around that:

1. If you show up and try to listen and interact every day of class, you should get a B or a B+ without any at-home work.

2. Hyperfocusing on projects I want to do is how I learn new things. Pick a path in life (eg Computers) where hyperfocusing on your own weird projects for 5-6 days in a row actually teaches you 90% of what you need to know in that field

3. If studying is absolutely required, then the goal is to take your notes (or the book) and try to rewrite them on a small cheat sheet. I’m not saying to cheat, just that the act of writing it all down in your own words is the best ‘studying’ there is"
How in the world do you guys study?,"I fixed this in uni (undiagnosed at the time so I didn’t know it was a good strategy) but by going to a small quaint library in a scenic part of the city sitting next to a window overlooking a beautiful garden.

Only left to go to the bathroom- didn’t even get another cup of coffee or food.

Worked for me 100% of the time. My only distraction was looking out the window but man was I dialled in. Never submitted a late assignment once and got stellar grades!

I can't ""study"" in the classic way of trying to read books, notes etc. The best I could do was a panicked last minute cram which was never enough. 

What I found worked (unfortunately rather too late for school) was instead doing practice papers, this helped in multiple ways, first one being because it was a timed exercise against the clock (although I would always complete the paper even if the time ran out).

Secondly because it meant that rather than a massive, massive chunk of ""unknowing"" revision which was overwhelming I could just focus the actual revision on the questions I'd got _wrong_ which cut down the ""I don't know where to start"" to ""I've got x number of things to revise starting from *here*""."

Took forever but eventually when I got to the 20th term and quizzed myself at random I’d ace it every time. Flash cards worked well for that."

When studying…


**Here is something I put together on another post on** r/college that I got from the Disability Student Services department when I was in college, and from my honors program. 

* **Work in 40-45 minute increments.**
   * In my honors classes, they told us that after about 40 minutes, we stop taking in new information and that it was important to stop and do something else (get a drink, take a walk, use the bathroom, etc) and then start a new subject

* **Learning good study habits is also important**. (My DSS office had me try studying in the following format, which was surprisingly helpful)

   * **Week 1:** study slides/readings week 1
   * **Week 2:** study slides/readings week 2, review week 1
   * **Week 3:** study slides/readings week 3, review weeks 2 & 1
   * **Week 4:** study slides/readings week 4, review weeks 3, 2 & 1
   * **Etc.**

* **While studying...**
   * **Mark in you notes the things that are off for you**
   * **Mark things that don’t make sense**
   * **Write any questions you have that are prompted from the material (even if you don’t think it’s relevant)**
      * This gives you stuff to ask about in class or in office hours, which demonstrates your drive to know the material and gives the professor a chance to mark down things that might be confusing for the whole class too.
   * **Go to office hours and talk to your Professors/Teaching Assistants!** You’d be surprised at how helpful they can be with figuring out how you can better study for your class. This only works if you know where you're struggling at (which you can figure out via the ""While studying"" bullet point above).


**Tools**

I used a surface pro and pen, but I know folks who used an iPad and pen. 

There are some great applications for computers and iPads that let you take handwritten notes right on the slides. Easy to mark up and highlight. 

I used onenote and it made my life so much easier. I just kept a handful of loose leaf pages for anything in class and everything else when into the onenote notebook. I even would take screenshots of stuff from the textbooks where I was struggling with stuff and mark that up too. 


I hope this helps!!!!"
How in the world do you guys study?,"I had to take notes for every single class I took, and every class had a separate notebook. I would also have multiple color pens and each color had its own meaning. Green would be for definitions, red would be for something I knew would be important/need for later, blue would be for basic notes about a topix, etc. It seems like a lot of work, but actually got really easy once I got in the groove of the system. The color coded system made studying easier when it came time for tests."
How in the world do you guys study?,Music without any words helps me stay grounded.
How in the world do you guys study?,"I'm studying for an IT certification on Friday so I'll break down how I go about it. Find free resources online about your subject. Quizlet is your friend on this and there will be heaps of study guides and other material if you do a bit of digging on other sites. Skim through them and handwrite down the common things you don't know. 

Read over the things you aren't familiar with a few times, then start talking through them like you're explaining it to someone else. If you have someone around that doesn't know anything about the subject, then this works better. Try and teach them what you're doing and find out where your knowledge falls short.

If you need to memorize something (for me its learning network port numbers and flashcards arent helping), handwrite it down until you can do it with your eyes closed

Youre not stupid for needing breaks or not being able to focus. The reason I handwrite my stuff is because it sort of locks me to my task so that even if I do start to lose focus, as long as I write down what I'm seeing, progress is being made. I also listen to synthwave when I work because the beeps and boops are steady, repetitive, and high energy enough where it acts as good background noise.

Take breaks when you need them. You got this"
How in the world do you guys study?,I pretty much only study while moving. I can work on math while sitting still but I let myself get up between problems. If I have to read a chapter then I will literally walk around with the book
How in the world do you guys study?,"I don't need to study for my degree, but I do have to read a lot of research (and write essays). But what I do is set a timer for 10/15/30 minutes. The time depends on how motivated/focused I feel. And then once the timer goes, I go have fun for half an hour. Playing a quick game of Overwatch, reading something fun or whatever. And after that I set a timer again. It isn't efficient, but it gets me to do at least something on days where I really don't want to.

I also have conditioned myself to focus when listening to certain music (I looked up adhd focus music and just picked one or two.) When the music is playing, I don't allow myself to veer off. If I notice I got distracted, I stop playing the music, finish whatever was distracting me, and then once I am ready, I go back to listening and working on my assignments. 

And when I am listening back to lectures, I tend to also play a game. Or crochet.  Or playing Set (a pattern recognition card game) Or just do anything with my hands that doesn't require too much thinking. I find that doing something with my hands keeps the boredom and the subsequent zoning out at bay quite well."
How in the world do you guys study?,"Honestly I don’t really understand what people mean when they say they are “studying” and at this point, I’m kind of afraid to ask. 

Basically the way I would prep for a test when I was in school was by just by taking notes on the subject of the test. On paper, and as close to the time of the test as possible. So generally this looked like the day before the test, taking the notes based on the textbook or other resources, and then the day of, just physically copying the notes I made again, just so the important relevant details are something that I was thinking about recently. 

The only other way that kind of makes sense to me is to find someone who doesn’t know about the thing you’re learning, and try to teach it to them. I’ve never done this, but I had a friend who it worked really well for and he used to ask me to help him study for stuff, which basically meant just hang out and let him tell me about the discrete maths or whatever. It’s mostly the same effect as the notes thing, just keeping the information you’re being tested on something you’ve had to think about recently."
How in the world do you guys study?,"I never did. I couldn't ever do it.

My sister has ADHD too (at least she says she does), and she was eventually able to go back to school and get her masters. I think the way she did it is that she made her studies her hyper-focus.

But there's no way I could ever do that. It'd be as foreign to me as flapping my wings to take flight."
How in the world do you guys study?,"Took four years to finish a three year degree because this one year I literally did nothing. Couldn't study for tests and exams. Before getting medicated I remember telling people it feels like my brain doesn't work and they thought I was crazy😭

What helped in my final year was always having a pen and paper. I would make random notes, not to study again but as a way to process info. This helped with my theory subjects. Colourful mind maps were my go to plus highlighting the textbook. And going through past papers. 

My math subjects were a breeze. Theory was so depressing I even wanted to drop out at some point. 

The difficult part is getting started. And even when I manage to start it's hard to keep going. Meds made it slightly easier to overcome this but it was still a hassle. My doctor even had to up my dose. 

Wish you all the best OP. It's definitely harder to get through school with adhd, but it is possible."
How in the world do you guys study?,"It varied for me depending on the class.

For the hardest class I took in high school (specifically a class in a subject that I hate to this day), I read the book aloud to my grandma the day before the test. After I read a section, we would play a round of rummy. After the round, I would continue reading. We kept track of who won all school year, and since I won the most games, I got to choose where we went out for dinner for a post school year celebration.

For most of the other classes, I scanned/read over notes I took during class, assignments done during that chapter, that kind of thing."
How in the world do you guys study?,"My advice would be to deal with your work as the motivation comes. With me I struggle to become motivated a lot but when I have the motivation to do so I get a lot done. Stressing about these kind of things is normal but if you think about it too much you will not get anything done. If you really want to change and can't stop thinking about it then try doing small bits of it throughout the day, it doesn't have to be in one sitting and it probably works best for us with adhd.

Hopefully this helps and know that everyone is slightly different when it comes to dealing with adhd."
How in the world do you guys study?,I do mine at work as I’m an apprentice and therefore get paid to study at work

How in the world do you guys study?,"I've dropped out of 5 educations because I was unable to study at home. And like you, I can't study in public or with someone.

Only thing that slightly helped and I'm at the end of my current education, was getting diagnosed and starting medication. But I still have huge problems.

It's like no matter how interested I am in the subject, if I study it for 3 months, all interest and excitement completely disappears, it becomes impossible to reignite it.

I have no idea what the solution is, I wish every single day my brain would function normally just for the duration of an education."
How in the world do you guys study?,"Question: why aren't you on Adderall or Vyvanse? You wouldn't have issues if you were on a stimulant. I speak from the experience of someone with undiagnosed ADHD for 43 years of my life, currently in grad school and still can't study. Got a diagnosis last year, got on Adderall and all of the sudden I can study! 


Have you thought about a stimulant?"
How in the world do you guys study?,"I ignore that responsibility until the morning of the test, wake up at a fucked up hour, spend as much time as possible cramming in as much material as possible, then take the test.

How in the world do you guys study?,"•I drink energy drinks and Americanos to help me focus, 

•I listen to instrumental music or songs where the singer has a smooth voice (I highly recommend beach house), at a low volume, otherwise I can’t concentrate. 

•I get out of my  apartment and go to my campus library. Being surrounded by people and it being quiet as I listen to my music helps a ton…

•I’ve also started writing out to-do lists and put on there the assignments and things I want to study. I’m an overachiever and get really anxious when I see things that are left unchecked on my list so this mindset kind of forces me to stop procrastinating and sit down for an hour or two. 

• OH! Also I give myself time limits. Like I set a timer for like 2 hours in the library. Sometimes I even extend the timer because by the 2 hour mark I’m deep into my assignment or notes. The time limits put pressure on me to stay focused and really try at concentrating 

lol, having undiagnosed (my psychiatrist keeps pushing me to get evaluated so I can actually get treatment) ADHD in the midst of getting my Master’s degree is brutal but I’ve developed some techniques thru trial and error (those mentioned above) I hope studying improves for you! 🤗"

How in the world do you guys study?,"i'm way past college but I still have to study every couple years to keep an industry certification current.  

For me meds take the edge off for starters.  Those allow for other strategies to work.  I like pomodoro's.  Basically you set a timer for say 15 mins.  You shut off your phone and other distractions and study for 15 mins and stop when the timer goes off.  Then do whatever you want for 5-10 mins and back to another 15 mins of dedicated study time.  There's phone apps to set all the timers and whatnot to make it easier too.

If i'm watching a video or live lecture I have a fidget cube that I keep in my hand during the lecture/video. It keeps the adhd part at bay for awhile giving my brain things to focus on."

How in the world do you guys study?,I am struggling with this right now too. I might fail a class because I have such a hard time writing papers and missed the deadline on a few of them. It’s awful. I’ve tried break down task but end up spending more time doing that and the pomodoro technique doesn’t work either cause I still get distracted. I have blocked social media on my computer and have a timer on my phone. (Don’t use it much anyways) and have literally spent 75% of my life medicated.

How in the world do you guys study?,"Try body doubling. Basically you have another person in the room with you while you study, but doing something that demands their focus so you don’t interact with them. I used this at home. Puzzles were an excellent thing for my partner to work on while I studied."
How in the world do you guys study?,"For tests in college, I made studying into a goal-oriented process — the goal being a concise study-guide.  I would start with class notes, book notes/summaries, etc, and get stuff to a point where the study guide was like 8 pages long, and then I would narrow and re-write it by hand over and over until I had it down to one page. At the time it came naturally and seemed obvious, but looking back, I think having a concrete goal beside just “knowing the stuff well enough” provided the challenge needed to trigger my hyper-focus. 

(Getting an actual “study guide” from professors that listed the topics covered on the test made the process much less stressful, as I didn’t have to start with all the class material  (it drove me crazy when a professor would refuse to give directions and instead give stupid, worthless advice like “study the book” 🙄🤬)."

How in the world do you guys study?,"“Small moves, Ellie.”

Don’t just make a goal: make a purpose for curiosity. Why should you care about the stuff you’re studying? Maybe it’s for a hobby or interest of yours. Maybe someone you care about needs help. Maybe you just need a little randomness to bring the information to you. Idk. Any motivation of yours can tie back to the stuff you’re studying in some form.

If you can integrate that connection to your beliefs, you can then make a discipline out of it. Or just start with some form of discipline. Use a timer of, say, 10 minutes to focus and 10 minutes to rest. I find that timers make me slightly anxious (except when I try to wake up). Make your own internal rewards system so that you not only use what you like, but also limit what you like so you can have more of it in the future. Start on a random or assigned page and see what happens.

These are just a few examples of small tools that can help you, and many others have also provided such tools. But ultimately, you gotta try and test what works for you. And if you took the time to write your request, I bet you’re curious enough to try out at least a few of these tools. Good luck ![img](emote|t5_2qnwb|29376)"

How in the world do you guys study?,Studying with ppl was my best bet. I always focused on finding a buddy who would study with me because in front of them I felt more pressure to stay on task.
How in the world do you guys study?,"What helped me: 3 hours per day is plenty if you’re focused. Don’t stress for not being able to sit still (because that’s usually all it is) for 10 hours like many others. During that three hours: go fast. Like speedrunning a game. Make charts, bullets, summaries, mindmaps. Apply extreme summarisation."
How in the world do you guys study?,"I have to set timers. I set a 30-50 timer. I will do specific tasks only for that allotted time. Then, I have a 5-10 minute break where I eat a snack or look at my phone. But, everything is on a timer. I wear headphones or ear plugs. No music usually or sometimes something to tune out. 
Remove as many distractions as possible. Like, sometimes I can’t sit in a chair. I need a blanket in my lap. I find being in a comfortable seat or position makes a big difference. 
There are hours of the day that your brain works better. I would find those. I find early morning hours to be the best for me because there are less distractions. (ie less people awake). 
That’s what works for me. Good luck!"
How in the world do you guys study?,"(TLDR: Find an ACTIVE way to play with the info. Don't just read.)

It's been a long time since I was in school, but here's what I would do now given all I've learned about my brain:

Choose a more concrete, ACTIVE way to interact with the material. ""Study"" is vague. You might need to DO something. 

Ideas: 

- Create a MIND MAP (on paper or use something like MindMeister). Deciding how to structure it gives you something to do and helps you grasp the info at a deeper level.

- Make it VISUAL: Draw little cartoons, find images online to compile in a document, use a particular picture or even a place you know well and ""attach"" different facts/names/dates/whatever to elements in the image. 
(Example: Parts of a cell as items in a hotel room. Doesn't have to make sense. Maybe TV=mitochondria, coffee maker=ribosomes, etc)

- Use external sources, esp. VIDEOS. Don't just try to memorize the textbook. Getting info from multiple sources helps to solidify it in your brain. 

- Read aloud to yourself. Maybe in different accents. 

- Make up hand motions or act things out

- If you're studying literature or even history, cast celebrities as the characters. Write it out or paste images into a doc. 

- Explain things to your pet/stuffed animal/smiley face you drew on your thumb. Teaching someone else helps you organize your thoughts."
How in the world do you guys study?,"I need to interact with the content. Write it out in my own words, summaries, when reading textbooks. 

When learning vocabulary for foreign language, or new words for a science class, flashcards. Only ones that I make myself.

When reading literature, I take notes on it in my notebook, with little pencil marks on the book page pointing to what the notes are referencing. Basically making my own footnotes. If I sell the book back later, I erase the marks. By the way, I only used physical books to study. But I graduated college in 2011. I really hope everybody isn't forced to digital books right now. I don't know how I'd work with those at all.

In class, I take notes with writing. Typing just does not work for taking notes. It doesn't make it stick in your head the same way. If your lecturer is fast, then you'll have to summarize what they're saying instead of getting each word down. That's a great way of learning!

I enjoy writing. I might be lucky that way. I also enjoy researching. So that wasn't a challenge.

I find math very difficult. Because I can't think of a good way to interact with the content other than getting it wrong again and again. I needed a tutor, and very simplified lessons from the basic math class textbooks, for that."
How in the world do you guys study?,I would put on a movie or tv show I had seen before and it distracted me just enough to study.

How in the world do you guys study?,"I could/can only study when my back was up against the wall and it was definitely the biggest fire that needed to be put out at that exact moment.  Needless to say, college was a struggle.  Now(25 years later) I just beat myself up for a couple hours until I wear myself down enough to start doing research.  Doesn't always work but I get by."
How in the world do you guys study?,"Firstly I copy everything down. Everything. Copy and paste. 

Then I reread it and make shorthand notes for everything. 


And I take those short-hand notes and the original text and I create a pretty document that works for me. 

And if I haven't remembered it by then I sing a little song about it.  I quiz myself, and I make all sorts of notes and highlights and pictures, because I'm really not getting it at this point.  I think I know my stuff, and 2 hours later it's completely gone.

And then after doing about 8 hours of studying for a 1 hour project, I promptly go and bomb it at the front of the class, and the professor gives me an F because I obviously didn't study. 

Then at the end of the year I fail the test and get booted out of college.

You know dreams where you are taking a test and you can't read the page and you don't know anything on it even though you've been studying all yeaI imagine it's all of our reality."
How in the world do you guys study?,Poorly
How in the world do you guys study?,"I study first thing in the morning when my brain is fresh. If you take meds you can try the methods of setting an alarm an hour before you wake up and taking the meds and going back to sleep. In the morning I try to keep my routine brief I just change my clothes and brush my teeth. I try not to do anything that may distract me until I start and finish studying. So I set limits on my phone so it won’t let me do any social networking, etc. I don’t listen to any music or watch tv until I start and finish studying. Also going for a quick walk and eating a good breakfast that doesn’t require too much to make(so I don’t get distracted) but also lots of protein. Then when I study I don’t cram I study for max an hour then move on. I try several different subjects when I study instead of staying on one. Then I do the 15 minute method. I try to study for 15 minutes when I get home and 15 minutes before bed."

How in the world do you guys study?,"I wound up cutting college back to part time and working my way through school.  although it took me almost 10 years to graduate, employers and law school were impressed that I stuck with it.  In law school, it was made for me so I hyperfocused the crap out of it and it was amazing.  However, in undergraduate I pretty much failed physics more than once but thanks to a special rule, was able to withdraw from the class like 2 weeks before the semester was over, because it turned out that if you worked more than 20 hours per week, the drop/add deadline did not apply to you.  I say it ""turned out"" because I had no idea, they did not advertise it, and I only found out because I had a super kind physics professor who pulled me to the side and asked me why I was doing so badly when it seemed I was so smart when i showed up.  I told him about my life and he said, well why don't you drop out and try again later.  I was dumbfounded.  Anyway that is a bit of a digression, but my point was that I wasn't very interested in physics and that made it so hard to read.  it was slippery and I kept trying to read the same paragraph over and over.  Meanwhile, I went to law school, and wound up at the top of my class.  Wow what a difference being interested in something makes!!"

How in the world do you guys study?,"For the record I’m a humanities student so take this with a grain of salt if you’re taking STEM courses. If it’s just reading through the textbook, I like to get the electronic version so that I can utilize the text to speech option most of them have and then you can listen to it being read to you. I like to clean or cross stitch or cook while listening. I personally usually don’t take notes unless I’m very unsure on how well I know the subject, but I would prioritize rewriting definitions of key terms in your own words so that it gets through to you. Include examples for as many as you can fit in the notes. That way it’s less straight reading and more of an activity. And then highlight the key terms that you aren’t sure you’ll remember so that you can go right back to them to read them over. 

Rhetorical devices are your friend, you want to make as many connections to what you’ve learned in other classes and the things you’re into as you can. When I was taking AP Psych a few years ago for example, to remember the stages of grief I just had to remember DABDA for Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, Acceptance. “DAB DA pain away.” It’s not stupid if it works. For proactive vs retroactive memory I made up the saying “old pro, no retro” based off the saying “old dog(pro) can’t learn new tricks” so I would remember if I was readying “proactive memory” the issue was that the person couldn’t learn new tricks (old information was blocking new information). I just do my best to always be actively thinking while studying, active recall is another good strategy I took inspiration from. 

Your goal is to get as much of the info as encoded into your mind as you can by connecting it to what you already know. Does a theory remind you of something you saw in your favorite TV show? Think about that and jot it down.  Can you make a fun acronym to remember something? I remember the order of famous Greek philosophers with the acronym “SPAA” Socrates taught Plato who taught Aristotle who taught Alexander the Great. 

Another good way is explaining what you’ve learned to someone else, I usually do it to my cat, but you can do it to a plant or stuffed animal too, that way you’re processing the information and you can figure out if you actually get the concept or not. If you can’t explain it to someone else in your own words, you probably don’t get it. 

Caffeine is your friend, sip on it while you’re studying if it’s not too late in the night. Put together a list of good lyric-less music to listen to (NO DOING WORK WHILE WATCHING TV OR YOUTUBE UNLESS YOU’RE JUST DOING LIKE MATH PROBLEMS OR CITATIONS) or no talking asmr. Take breaks, usually I do about 45 min - 1 hour of work and then I take about 15 minutes if break, usually doesn’t actually work out like that but I aim for that, figure out what works for you. Try to pick out a reward if you work well in your session, like watching an episode of a show you’re looking forward to or buying yourself a nice lunch tomorrow."

How in the world do you guys study?,"I didn't. Even in grad school I would just attend the lectures and *maybe* read the chapters from the textbook or look over the PowerPoints the day of the exam. Thankfully most of my degree was less about rote memory and more about synthesizing information in real world scenarios, so rarely was it closed note. 

I struggled a little more in general eds in undergrad, but still it was mostly about skimming readings and forcing focus during lectures. I also took a lot of writing intensive classes whenever possible because I could bullshit my way through a paper easier than I could an exam."

After this I’ll usually just read the notes either right before my test or at least once a day leading up to it.

How in the world do you guys study?,"I struggled sm too. I felt stupid asf all my life til I found ways that work for me: 

-NO extensive to-do lists bc that's gonna overwhelm me > procrastination > feelings of guilt/shame/anxiety

-utilize alarms/reminders on my iphone calendar (check everyday & update every Sun/Mon)

-big tasks into smaller blocks—use pomodoro method 

-be proud and reward myself for starting the task even if its small 



**Big tasks—start 2-1.5 weeks prior due date:**

1. grab fav. drink/snack to hype myself

2. use bathroom beforehand, phone on silent + faced down or leave at diff. room

2. find quiet place & sit down at a desk > open study/work material 

3. play pomodoro timer on YT 

4. immediately start ""intro sesh"" for 10-15 mins (task outline + evaluation of how much time it requires) 

5. can keep going using pomodoro timer or come back later to continue task 

6. key is small chunks & repeat

7. writing over typing: cornell method for notetaking > index cards for memorizing (think of it as mini cheat sheets) 



I noticed that the act of starting a big, important task is extremely overwhelming for me. So I break tasks to minimize stress and that makes everything that comes after easier (less burden/anxiety). 

I work on one topic for 30-45min and change to a diff. topic to keep myself from getting bored. 

Clutter on desk or multiple unrelated tabs on laptop distract me so I ritually close/put away everything when starting."

3.  I take a lot of breaks.  My limit is probably two hours just like the length of a class I can do before I start dying inside.  I’ll go walk my dog, go to the store, eat, smoke some weed or game.  I set an alarm for between 1-3 hours, depending on how I feel and how much needs to be done, then I get back to it and repeat.

So what I do is, I force myself to read a page for 5 minutes. Then my mind goes to ""wtf I dont understand anything, I'm so dumb, can't do sh*t, there goes my diploma and so on and so forth. I know how the whole downplaying and self loathing goes. 

After feeling sorry for myself and loathing my mind. I tell myself ""let's just write down what we don't understand so we can ask the teacher"", no searching for answers, just write it down with a drawing of some sort. Low and behold we are studying for 1 hour already. And ask these questions via mail, that way you have the explanation on paper.

Example: Mechanics of Dynamics (engineering)
What does this formula mean?
Why is the acceleration different?
Ect. 

These questions trigger your adhd brain to find the answer.

Your adhd brain is not going to work with the mindset ""why can't I understand this principle"" it will understand "" why does it work like this, how are x and y connected?.

So try to ask yourself questions like you are the teacher and the student simultaneously. After a while of doing this roleplay you have a great dynamic of asking questions and immediately give the answer and correct yourself when you are wrong.

Be kind to yourself, you're doing your best. Does not mean that you have to give up on yourself because it is not working. It will work, give yourself the chance to grow."

How in the world do you guys study?,"Medication could help. I found it really hard and wasn’t diagnosed as a kid. My anxiety would power me through getting things done last minute. I tried listening to classical music so I had something to entertain me but not distract me with lyrics so I wouldn’t be singing along. 

My brain only understands something when it fits into something else I already know. I can’t just memorize dates or facts out of nowhere without a general understanding and timeline."

How in the world do you guys study?,Use timers so the 5 minute break can't turn into 5 hours and use rewards.
How in the world do you guys study?,"I have my studying method, which works for me, hope it works for you too. My way is taking my messy notes from class and doing clean ones. Now I use a app on my computer but I've been doing it by hand for years. I copy and reorganize the text. I read somewhere that if you take notes on blue pen you learn more than if you do it on black, so I took it to the limit and use lots of diferent colours for different topics and different thickness for different levels of importance. This way, thinking on how to do it forces myself to subconsciously organize my mind and interioize the structure of the topics. On the end I end up taking 20 pages of dull boring notes on big and bad caligraphy and turn it into one page of fun notes.

If then I still haven't learnt it I make a list of concepts or turn it into pdf and read it ereasing the things I already know.

The whole point is to make it look the most short possible and turn it into something phisycal so I don't have to focus on reading over and over again."

How in the world do you guys study?,"A trick I got onto in paramedic school was that I would begin reading the chapters that we would be going over a week before we went over them in class. I’m a weightlifter so I would read for a couple of minutes between sets. Then the day after the lecture, I would reopen the PowerPoint and take a new set of notes. In class I took notes on a google doc but the next day I would take the notes on paper. This usually took me no more than about 40 minutes depending on how long the PowerPoint was and how comfortable I was already with the material. Doing this made it so that I could spend far less time cramming for exams, and when I did review for exams, I had a good selection of notes to look at rather than sifting through books and PowerPoints."
How in the world do you guys study?,"Depends on the subject and how interested I was, but I usually went to a quiet room in the basement of the  library with no phone or computer.  Eliminate all potential distractions. Make a numbered list of what you need to do. Read a sentence/paragraph do what ypu can. Get up, pace, sitdown. Repeat. Get comfortable with that and try to increase how much you can do over time. Starting is the hardest part."
How in the world do you guys study?,"Medication helped me a lot, but also how are you studying? There are quizzes you can take to figure out what kind of learning style works for you. I do better with visual and kinesthetic(physical) learning. So this is what worked for me in college.

1. Studying in coffee shops and libraries, where I cant get up and do something else.

2. Mental maps. I would use poster board/big piece of paper to copy all the notes and power points onto one piece of paper. Then I can draw lines and pictures to show how each thing works together.

3. Bringing flash cards on walks so you associate places with each card.

4. Audiobooks. At my college they had a program that would turn text books into audio books so you can read and listen at the same time.

5. Headphones, listening to music while working

6. Highlighting, just helps me follow along.

7. You can use paper or cards to help you follow along on which sentence you are reading. Hold the paper under your current sentence so you dont get lost.

Honestly for me the more creative and novel. The better. It still was hard to study, its super boring, but these things helped me to get something done. Dont forget to praise yourself for whatever you did get done. Even the tiniest bit of studying is a big accomplishment. Its important to celebrate that because its very easy to get down on yourself."
How in the world do you guys study?,"So it took me probably ten times longer than it would take a normal person, but I would  

- put TV on in the background, something boring like BBC news, but it gave me something to look up at every few seconds which helped me stay on the studying 

- the way I ‘studied’ was by writing things out with cute pens in multi colours, having nice stationary. That pleased me.

- but yeah generally I was and am really really bad at studying. It was really hard and thankfully I am not in education anymore, but I did get a masters from a world class university"
How in the world do you guys study?,"Alone in a quiet room, after catastrophizing the exam, having had 8 hours of sleep and trying to do easier questions first until I somewhat nail them before touching stuff I'll break my head over for an extended period of time"
How in the world do you guys study?,"Only work in 50 minute to hour blocks. 

If you are studying for 50 minutes, take a 10 minute break.

If you are studying for 60 minutes, take a 15 minute break.

Use a timer to manage this. And if you're on a roll and don't want to stop studying, you still have to stop. This is about budgeting your time and focus. Respect your breaks.  

Repeat this for 4-6 hours. Do not exceed 6 hours, beyond that and your brain won't be working properly anymore. Rest. 
Pick one block during the day to have lunch (20-30 minute break depending on how long your study sessions are).  

During your breaks, DO NOT go on your phone, scroll, or process new information  (you're using that energy for studying). Stretch, have a snack, play an instrument. But rest your brain and eyes during breaks. This means that during lunch, you are only eating lunch. Not scrolling or studying more. 

Make sure you start off your day with a proper amount and kind of food. A single piece of toast will make you crash quick as the day goes on. Stay hydrated, have a balanced breakfast, and look into foods that favor mental focus (diet is super important for ADHD brains, the attentional dysregulation is significantly influenced by how our brains metabolize nutrients, and having poor impulse control doesn't help). 

TLDR: Study in blocks, take short breaks for every block, do not process any new information during breaks, make good dietary choices, and respect the timer. 

Exercising also helps tremendously. You can even do little workouts on your breaks. 

I've been studying 2 years worth of math this past 4 months with this technique, and haven't used my ritalin the vast majority of the time. This is like a workout for your brain. The more you have successful days, the easier it will get with time. ADHD is not a death sentence. You can do it, it just takes discipline. Best of luck!"

Although it’s not healthy my negative self talk really helps lol.

I just keep telling myself not to be a bitch.

How in the world do you guys study?,"Quizlet website is very helpful. Reviewing previous tests, or quizzes etc. vs reading the entire books over. 

You could also use the previous tests to make flash cards and do flashcard games. Just making the flashcards could help with having an interesting task that is fun to create while also reviewing."
How in the world do you guys study?,"I have two degrees with first class honours and still have no idea. 😵‍💫

I ended up hiring a tutor for the second honours, because it kept me more accountable than I had been previously. I was still scrambling at the last minute and taking days to write things that other students would in hours, though.

There’s a trope about optimising study by figuring out whether you’re a visual, written, or practical learner, and I can honestly say that I am none of these things. It feels like nothing sticks in my brain, and it’s infuriating.

I think my biggest tool was determination. I refused to let my brain win.

Edit: I forgot to add that I ended up moving to online learning in the early days of the pandemic because of lockdowns. The adjustment from in-person learning sucked, but it ended up being a blessing in that I could study during the time I’d be transiting to campus etc. The online format also had no exams (but more assignments), which allowed me to pace myself better."

But boy can I solve a problem. It’s like my brain is electrified, like Im on coke or something. 

So I studied a math based subject. I have zero problems doing algebra or geometry. I love drawing pictures and outlining my logic. It’s more like creating something than consuming information.  The learning in these subjects comes from reasoning through things on your own. So I feel like that is easier than assimilating information."

It takes so much effort to try to read a snippet that I get too exhausted to continue.

How in the world do you guys study?,"I think I never study. What on the earth is the study? LOL

In elementary school, I only read as much as possible. Never try to study hard. I still managed to rank 1 or 2 int he class.

In junior and senior high, I only read as much as possible. Subjects that don't require numbers are my specialty. I don't have any problem with that. My biggest enemies are Physics, Math and Chemistry.

My junior high is like the peak of my studies. But when I was in High School, I went to slump. I started to neglect study. Doesn't prepare much for exams. I have no interest in study.

I have my courage back in college. Still, I only study hard for the exam the night before the examination takes place. LOL. I still can't fight subjects that require numbers as Statistics.

when I lost interest again in college, it takes longer than average to graduate.

But, when I fixated on getting a position or job, I'll study hard for the paper test and interview as if my life is on the line. Just read, read, and read., and memorize Practices makes perfect."

I at the beginning often say if in 20m I still am saying fuck this it sucks blah blah I can tap out but only if I actually do it no checking the clock every 2s. 

But tbh usually I just scare myself into it. I have severe anxiety so it’s easy. 
If you don’t open the textbook today you won’t have time to read before you neeed to take notes and if you don’t take notes you’ll only get a 75 instead of a 100 and if you get a 75 that means to pass with an a I’ll need a 85 on the final which is notoriously impossible and I need that a so my GPA doesn’t drop because if it does then my tentative admission to grad school is over all that work will be for nothing I’ll have to tell everyone I know I actually didn’t get in anymore all because lil bitch didn’t wanna read chapter 13.

I only learn more when I HAVE to for my work. A quick rabbit hole on google and I'm done.

I like my job. I actually love aspects of it as it can scratch my brain in that perfect way at times. I'm happiest when I get to chase rabbits and figure things out.  I don't NEED to get the certifications except for my own ego. Don't think I ever will. It's frustrating as hell.

while reading the boring chapter, write down things that stood out to you. Feel free to draw what you learn too. 

Then for tests, make flash cards/ draw stars by the important stuff that stood out to you in class/ you read.

How in the world do you guys study?,"Not very helpful, but I’m the complete opposite. I’m a theoretical physicist and I cannot not study. I’m so extremely fascinated with what I’m studying, it’s almost addicting. Yesterday I went through the exercises in a new book I got on string theory and I started getting hungry at some point and I looked at the clock. I had been going for 6 hours. 

I generally love thinking. I love observing how my mind works and I spend a lot of time in my imagination. I also have autism so idk if that plays a role. 

On the other hand, I absolutely hate physical tasks. It feels so boring and repetitive and it feels like I’m wasting my time. But I force myself to get a bit of exercise every day.

As for studying techniques, I use the Feynman method. When there is something I want to learn, I study it and use material from all the different sources I can find. After I get a sense of understanding the topic, I’ll pretend I have to teach myself. I explain the things to myself in as many different ways as possible and if I find something I’m not sure about, I spend some time thinking about it and then I look it up and see if my extrapolation was correct. This method just comes natural to me and I didn’t know there even was a name for it until recently. This technique has helped me learn things extremely fast. I used to hate math in school so I never paid attention. It wasn’t until I decided to study physics that I realized I had to have a solid foundation in mathematics, so I started teaching it to myself. Within 1 year I went from only being able to do simple algebra to having a good understanding of differential geometry. And this technique is also amazing for teaching others, because I’m so used to explaining things in many different ways."

They also have had articles for Vayarin (a medical food that is now no longer sold in the US because its research was bunk) that suspiciously looked like stealth advertisements (which is highly unethical and illegal in the US).

How in the world do you guys study?,ikr
How in the world do you guys study?,Yep. Only works if you can create the list once and use it over and over to get the most of the effort you put into making them.
How in the world do you guys study?,"I relate so hard to your post and this comment. usually any advice given feels like somehow the person truly doesn't get it.... because i find it is literally impossible unless I am medicated and ""harness"" the meds for the task at hand."
How in the world do you guys study?,"This. I struggle with this aspect so much, no one seems to get it (not even my ADHD-brother or my ‘mentor’). It’s so frustrating, that me trying to get an overview of what needs to be done, breaking the tasks into smaller/more specific ones, ends up being a major task in itself, so often I ‘die trying’ in the process, and then nothing really gets done (/further) anyway.. How do you manage it, have you found ways to get around this issue; getting an overview beforehand & then actually get shit done eventually?"
How in the world do you guys study?,Yeah I have that problem too so I try it to be too specific and I set a timer so I can complete making my list by a reasonable time.
How in the world do you guys study?,"this website is going to change my life. thank you so much, dear savior"
How in the world do you guys study?,break it down in an unsual way for an adult to do haha like 1. open file xyz -- a very straightforward and detailed list.
How in the world do you guys study?,"My coach asked me to try pompdoro to help with boring tasks at work. I actually find it's more useful to keep me from going down rabbit holes when I do interestng stuff. I set it to 50 mins and a 10 min break. The timer going off means I'm less likely to get lost in something and have time-blindness kick in. I'll spend the 10 min break writing down where I got to, so I can pick up where I left off easier, before moving onto something else. 

Not exactly what pompdoro was meant for but it actually does help me a lot."
How in the world do you guys study?,"my fav way of doing pomodoro is like ""ok twenty five minutes I HAVE to do this task for and in five minutes I can optionally have a break and then start the next thing if I'm not feeling it"". I like jumping around with tasks so it kinda gives me the freedom to do that but also forces me to stay on task long enough to at least get something done. Haha I think not interrupting flow and just ignoring the break if you are in flow is honestly the ""correct"" way to do pomodoro w ADHD"
How in the world do you guys study?,"Same, the only reason I use them now is to remind me to fill up my glass of water, because otherwise i don't drink enough during my study sessions, which is especially not good when I'm on my medication."
How in the world do you guys study?,"Congratulations on completing your prior theses, and on finishing your current one by Monday!  With ADHD deadlines can be so painful, but also effective."
How in the world do you guys study?,"I crammed for 4 college finals in a span of 3 days after skipping nearly every class all semester. Somehow, I managed to do well, but I was always (and still am) miserable because of it."
How in the world do you guys study?,I’d do this but stay up till 3am to “finish” the homework but in reality I’d be too tired at that point and I’d pass out
How in the world do you guys study?,"thank you, i hope so"
How in the world do you guys study?,That’s because you’re just hiding from the issue rather than actually confronting it. 
How in the world do you guys study?,"Yeah, i can lie there forever and my problems are just all there by my side, watching me, but i can just curl up in a ball and do nothing and just be stuck indefinetly. Now that i have a job i'm kinda good at getting out of bed and dragging myself there, but i'm still a zombie until 10am and i just function on autopilot thinking about all my silly little things until that time"
How in the world do you guys study?,Yes I have to admit this would also be impossible if I was not on my meds lmfao
How in the world do you guys study?,adderall 60 IR
How in the world do you guys study?,this is what i ended up doing too lol
How in the world do you guys study?,"Definitely look into it. I was a ""gifted"" kid growing up. Did so well in primary and high school but the moment I got to university everything tanked. 

I have read stories of people on here who went through the same thing and realised that I never relied on my own execution function. Everything was done for me by parents. I would forget submission dates and exam dates so my mom had me write everything in my diary and give it to her everyday to check. They had to wake me up to study and force me to make study notes because i wasn't doing these things and had no sense of urgency. When I got to university nobody was doing these things for me and that's when the cracks started showing hence the struggle.

College is hard. More especially in your case. But if you genuinely feel like this is more than just school being difficult ànd feel like it's a mental issue, do get help ASAP. If it's a mental issue it will get worse. I genuinely wish I could've gotten help sooner. In my case it was a mix of MDD, anxiety and adhd. It was a mess."
How in the world do you guys study?,"What is your question, though?"
How in the world do you guys study?,"Procedure manual, like you're NASA"
How in the world do you guys study?,"I’ve had the thought of making templates for specific repeating tasks sooo many times, but never ending up with any, at most maybe only some sort of half-drafts.. And everytime I’ll be in a similar situation like the ones before with some task, I’m like *ughh*, I’ve been through this shit before, I need that step-by-step to free up some cognitve capacity…!"
How in the world do you guys study?,I think you’ve just given me another experiment to try!! I struggle with this the most at night. Would be a great way to at least keep some track of the time
How in the world do you guys study?,"Yeah exactly! With the Forest app I've been using those on-task pomodoros to 'buy' myself guilt free entertainment time too. I noticed I kept restricting myself from intentionally doing anything fun, but I'd still be procrastinating with less intentional autopilot stuff like scrolling shorts or reddit. Now if I have study time banked, I can start a timer and go play a video game or whatever and not feel crippling guilt or shame about it."
How in the world do you guys study?,"I was literally the same when last year I did things and eventually got me naturally just to wake up earlier then I went on this course and like the first time ever. I knew I had to get in bed latest 12 pm and be up like 7 or 8 am otherwise I’d feel shit. Not only that I knew like i had to do it because the work wouldn’t be done. Like before if I had an appointment for something and I dunno if it’s an adhd trait or something but I knew because it was an appointment or anything like that, I knew I didn’t have to do anything except just turn up. But when that ended I sttarted to wake up early and I was getting out bed without even thinking about it straight away. Now that I’ve got no course to go on that getting out of bed straight away is starting to get hard again"
How in the world do you guys study?,LMAOOO exactly meds are crucial. Especially if your material requires heavy reading
How in the world do you guys study?,"Okay gotcha. I’m taking an extended release with the same components as Adderall (Mydayis), and am thinking of switching to something else."
How in the world do you guys study?,"part of the reason I think I performed executive functions growing up is because my family would hound me if I wouldn’t and they would constantly nag so I compensated by just doing it so that they wouldn’t and of course now when I talk to them about struggling, they don’t understand the struggle of making myself sit down to write an assignment and being unable because my brain feels like a fast wheel spinning around all the time"
How in the world do you guys study?,"Ugh, sorry. I was replying to another comment, in the mists of time, this has happened to me recently a few times. Anyway your comment gives me hope, and amazing that with the meds you were able to study. I get the impression that for some people they still have trouble studying. 

I can’t wait for the diagnosis and meds. I’m nervous but hopeful. One question if you would: do you medicate consistently or is it possible that i could choose to just medicate on days when I need to study?  Lectures are particularly challenging bc I can’t seem to process spoken information. Thanks :)"
How in the world do you guys study?,"Yeah, sorta. From my understanding though, we make procedure manuals for lab tests (where I work) to minimize variation between any two technicians."
How in the world do you guys study?,"IDK, I've never felt that way. If I have done that a few times, I don't need an instruction sheet to do it. It's usually when there are several menial and tedious tasks I have problems with prioritizing which one to do first and I start and stop in the middle and move on to the next task and keeps going till I get frustrated."
How in the world do you guys study?,"OOoooh love that idea of ""banking"" the time. I will usually set like a goal like ""I'll do 5 Pomodoro things today"", but banking is such a good idea"
How in the world do you guys study?,deffo talk to your psych and see what they recommend
How in the world do you guys study?,"As my doctor said, you have to take breaks from Adderall so you don't build up a tolerance to it. It's 3-5 days on, then 2 off. I am in a research and thinking-heavy degree (biomedical sciences PhD) and it is not a good idea for me to come into the lab or go to a think/focus heavy class if I am not on my meds. Ive already tried many times, it sucks...couldn't learn anything, asked really dumb questions cuz I couldn't hold onto info so I could connect the dots, can't even do new math calculations for lab stuff, constantly mess up experiments....just forget trying to do this off meds, it doesn't work.  So, I choose to take the meds of the days I need to study, do heavy thinking or complex experiments in the lab, or need to attend a thinking-heqvy class that day."
How in the world do you guys study?,"Thanks. That makes total sense. I’m doing fine arts/ studio. Some days I’d be close to fine for hands-on things, for art history and other classes, I’d need to focus. This is helpful. And amazing what you’re doing. Best of luck!"

Dexedrine and Guanfacine together at the same time.,I am a 2nd year pharmacy student. Guanfacine’s effect is going to decrease with stimulants.120 resting hr and increased BP are going to require monitoring by you and your prescriber. i don’t see Guanfacine or BBs alone lowering your HR to 60-70 if that is your end goal
Dexedrine and Guanfacine together at the same time.,"I take vyvanse and guanfacine. I tend to have elevated blood pressure, but I don’t have tachycardia. Guanfacine lowers my blood pressure slightly, which is good, and helps my brain quite a bit. Since my blood pressure is normally elevated, I’ve never experienced the side effects like dizziness that some may experience from low pressure. I take 4mg Intuniv and 30mg Vyvanse in the morning. Some people take the guanfacine at night since it makes them sleepy. I found the opposite to be true for me, so I take it in the morning. 

Explain your concerns to your doctor though. A beta blocker may be the better option for you. Especially if stimulants fully address your ADHD symptoms."
Dexedrine and Guanfacine together at the same time.,"Thank you for the advice. I’m going to request a referral to a cardiologist. I should also add that I consume a lot of caffeine, but unsure if it makes a difference due to my tolerance to caffeine."
Dexedrine and Guanfacine together at the same time.,May I ask how Guanfacine helps with your adhd?
Dexedrine and Guanfacine together at the same time.,"for sure tell the cardiologist that, they will have better insight. caffeine increases systolic bp ~5 mmhg as a good rule of thumb. idk about resting hr though. it’s good you’re monitoring you vitals tho for sure."
Dexedrine and Guanfacine together at the same time.,"Honestly I struggle to understand what it is helping with, but it helps. I stopped taking it for a while thinking it didn’t do anything, but my life suffered. Work was harder, it took me 25% longer to do things, I felt like it was harder to communicate or think through things. I have no clue how to describe it other than my brain works better when I take it. Some people say it helps their anxiety, irritability, or impulsiveness."
Dexedrine and Guanfacine together at the same time.,"That’s fair enough, hopefully I get the same"

Is Dexedrine readily available in the US?,"Everyone is different, usually doctors try different stimulants until one works. adderall most likely has the highest success rate so doctor’s usually try that first"
Is Dexedrine readily available in the US?,My son was on Dexedrine for a few years and I take a small dose of it when my Vyvanse wears off to take the edge off.  I think because its an older drug and many psychiatrists think there are newer drugs that work better.
Is Dexedrine readily available in the US?,"Vyvanse (Lisdexamfetamine) is pretty popular - it's dextroamphetamine that only 'becomes' dextroamphetamine once your liver does its thing to it.

It is my experience as well that dex is more effective than the methylphenidate based options."
Is Dexedrine readily available in the US?,"The rest of the world uses Dexedrine (with a few exceptions like japan where it’s illegal). The US mostly uses Adderall. The rest of the world has single payer health care. The US has pharmaceutical sales reps and political lobbyists. 
Benzedrine is the oldest drug - it’s just 50:50 amphetamine. A decade or so later dexedrine came along which is 100% dexamfetamine, it pretty much replaced Benzedrine because it was more effective at a lower dose and had far fewer side effects. || methedrine got retconned || and then when dexedrine became and old drug they funded some studies that 75:25 was actually the best treatment and funnily enough that combination could also be patented as a new drug called Adderall. They make some marketing claims about it being more effective, being less addictive blah blah blah take some doctors on some beach holidays and Adderall becomes the new drug ok the scene. Around the same time there was an increase in ADHD diagnosis and Adderall rode that wave to becoming the cultural icon it is today.

It’s an inferior drug, but it’s just become what’s demanded in America due cultural reasons and then after a point due to its own success. People in Europe even referrer to ADHD drugs as Adderall."
Is Dexedrine readily available in the US?,"Hope this helps:

“*The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Dexedrine for prescription use in 1976. While it is not the most popular ADHD treatment on the market, it is still occasionally prescribed.*

*Adderall, another central nervous system stimulant, was approved by the FDA in 1996 and has been used to treat both ADHD and sleep disorders often since then.*

*The main difference between Dexedrine and Adderall is that while Dexedrine only contains dextroamphetamine, Adderall contains both dextroamphetamine and amphetamine.*”"

Is Dexedrine readily available in the US?,"My ADHD is very much more mental, then physical, brain is always thinking never shuts up, but the day I took my Dexedrine, it's like I had 3/5 TV's going in my head turn off, it's like I could actually hear my self think

Was the best feeling I had ever had, very euphoric"
Is Dexedrine readily available in the US?,"I feel that Dexedrine is the best ADHD medication as its a direct mental stimulatant, us living with ADHD is already always on the move due to impulsiveness, but that's were the Dexedrine does it's thing, as i recently learned that Adderall is basically 70% mental but also 30% physical(correct me if im wrong), I literally do not think I'd be able to actually ""Relax"" if I was on Adderall, the dexamphetamine actually shuts my brain up and it's the most euphoric feeling actually being able to hear my own thoughts, I can't encourage it more to people that are thinking of trying something different then Adderall :)"
Is Dexedrine readily available in the US?,"Levo has some benefits. Mostly I think it causes anxiety which people confuse with motivation. But it does seem to have a synergistic effect. 

I wonder when they'll release a 7:1 dextro:levo formulation. Meanwhile compound pharmacies are shaking their heads."
Is Dexedrine readily available in the US?,"Very interesting, I personally have always been physically always on the move, having Adderall I wouldn't be able to relax, im glad with Dexedrine, I can actually sit down and not have to feel like I need to get up every 10 mins, cause of the mental stimulating affect of dexamphetamine"
Is Dexedrine readily available in the US?,"But why is Adderall/Ritalin always seemed to be prescribed over it 🤔 

Im legitimately curious haha"
Is Dexedrine readily available in the US?,Very true
Is Dexedrine readily available in the US?,"You definitely would be able to mentally feel relaxed, if you have physical hyperactivity you might even feel your physical on the go-ness more treated by adderall BUT the effect of both is extremely similar from what I’ve heard. It’s essentially just the strength. Youd just have a slightly higher heart rate, blood pressure, maybe slightly more jittery etc. on adderall.
It’s hard to quantify but at the same dose Adderall is about 80% as mentally stimulating as d-amfetamine, but has more perhiperal side effects. 
L-amphetamine is still a powerful psychoactive drug, it’s just less powerful than d. It is possible that it interacts with the dopaminergic system in some ways that compliment the d isomer to create a synergistic effect - but in reality for most users you get the same treatment of ADHD you just need a higher dose of adderall to do it."
Is Dexedrine readily available in the US?,"Interesting, I also suffer from Executive Dysfunction, which the Dexamphetamine really helps! I take 40mg every day (8 Pills) take them 3 when I wake up 3 at lunchtime and 2 around 2pm, they actually help me sleep! Which blew my mind, because I feel actually tired at night, I feel Adderall would keep me awake, I think i would be alot physically restless due to the Amphetamine addition in Adderall"

Dexedrine taper,"I'm on dexy. Worst case scenario you'll be a little tired and hungry for a few days, maybe some headaches."
Dexedrine taper,"Your psych is leaving you untreated for adhd. It takes a long time for the brain to rebalance and even then, in my case it took probably 6 months but I’d been on stimulants since I was 8 years old. Ask your psych what options she can give you to treat your adhd because it’s not like it doesn’t impact your life. If she won’t suggestive an alternative I’d suggest you find a new one"
Dexedrine taper,"Most prescription stimulants don’t require a taper, but I’m not familiar with Dexedrine because it’s one of the oldest stimulants used to treat ADHD and not often prescribed where I’m at. A more modern stimulant might be better, but also I’ve found that a new clinician often wants to mess with stuff sometimes when it’s not necessary. 

The good news is modern stimulants generally don’t do that for most people. I’m on a higher dose of Vyvanse and can go off it cold turkey for a few days and not have a single issue with withdrawal. If you’re psychiatrist follows suggested titration schedules it doesn’t take too long to find the right dose for a new medication. 

But that sucks you are having such a rough time with it."

"Is there any Adult here who struggled with time blindness, excessive tardiness, time management, productivity well into adulthood and then some how overcame it? If so, pls tell me how","I used to be late for everything and the ""trick"" was just that I started valuing not being late. More accurately I grew to hate that pit of the stomach worry as I raced to get somewhere I am already significantly late to. 

Now I get ready early and when I get the urge to do little time wasting things beforehand I ignore them and remind myself that I do not have the capacity to waste a little bit of time, I will always get sucked in and end up being late."
"Is there any Adult here who struggled with time blindness, excessive tardiness, time management, productivity well into adulthood and then some how overcame it? If so, pls tell me how","23f here, what I’ve found works is visually mapping out how long things take to do (my go to app is called Structured) and then adding 15/30/60 minute buffers depending on how scattered I’m feeling! Always give yourself more time in advance than you think you need, and it doesn’t hurt to show up early. For example in my morning routine I give myself an hour extra to eat breakfast before I take my vyvanse because I can’t get moving until they kick in. It takes me 2 hrs to feel ready and awake, but that’s part of having adhd and working with it rather than against it. Hope this helps!"
"Is there any Adult here who struggled with time blindness, excessive tardiness, time management, productivity well into adulthood and then some how overcame it? If so, pls tell me how","I’ve not conquered it at all, but I’ve found somethings that help. They won’t make you into millionaire entrepreneur but they might make you feel like you’re wasting less time and be more proud of yourself. 

- Buy clocks in all your main rooms especially the bathroom. They can be cheap, they can be fun whatever doesn’t matter just get them. You want a minimum of three.  

- Set those clocks ten minutes fast or however much you are normally late by. 

- Be early for something. This sounds like it’s from the boomer school of insensitive advice, but if you challenge yourself to be early for one thing once, even just by 5 minutes - buy yourself a treat or do your favourite thing because you earned it. You worked hard for something that’s naturally difficult for you well done.

- well done you’ve been early once, and your brain maybe after a couple of weeks might even start to forget that all the clocks around your house are fast. How do you make it a habit? 

- Find away to enjoy being early, whether that’s book time, podcast time blah blah, Switch, Reddit whatever something portable that you enjoy. You get to do that while you wait. 

If you reframe that early time as treat time it’s a whole lot easier to be early. (Easier said than done, I know but it’s incremental, we’ll get there slowly.)

You got to your appointment, great now you can reaaaaaaaly relax and you can also be proud that you are really making progress. 

- This might sound like a lot but just start with the clocks and go from there, oh and make sure you buy batteries for them too at the same time. 

- Thanks for listening to my Ted Talk the whole time I’ve been typing this I should have been doing something else."

While I’m seeing a psychiatrist soon to try medication again, there has only been one thing that works for me. Before I know I have to be somewhere, sometimes days before, I will map out the time it takes to get to where I need to go, give myself an appropriate amount of buffer time for classic ADHD shenanigans, and subtract that time from the time I absolutely need to be somewhere. The resulting time becomes the time that I NEED to be out of the house. If you don’t have a wristwatch, I suggest getting one so you can check for this time consistently—or, if not doing so consistently, it’ll pop up in the corner of your eye while doing normal things."

One thing that helps me is the night before, I try to do a mental run through of what I will do in the morning (get up, go pee, brush teeth, put on face stuff, get dressed, etc) and then try to streamline it for myself: put out the clothes I’m going to wear, clear off the bathroom counter so only my toothbrush and face stuff are out, set up the coffee maker, put out the oatmeal or whatever it is you’re going to eat for breakfast, make sure the lunch box and Tupperware are clean and ready to go. Just doing the little steps that let you slide into things more easily.

And the overarching of all of this is you have to have the urgent feeling I HAVE TO GET THERE ON TIME. Which means you HAVE TO leave by x time. You HAVE TO be ready to walk out the door by x-10 minutes, you HAVE TO be dressed by x-30 minutes. Which sometimes means you don’t brush your hair or you only take two bites of breakfast or your kid has mismatched socks, you have to prioritize getting out the door. "

If so, pls tell me how","I think time blindness exists on a spectrum like anything else. I seem to be particularly time blind and I haven't found any real solutions. I'm much better at time management than I was before. And my wife calendars our whole life which I use religiously.

But as soon as I'm done looking at the calendar or planning what I'm planning. The concept of time immediately disappears again. Because it's like trying to remember a color that you are colorblind to. Sure you can focus on this lack and plan around it, but how are you supposed to be ever present and ever thinking about something you cannot see or feel?"
"Is there any Adult here who struggled with time blindness, excessive tardiness, time management, productivity well into adulthood and then some how overcame it? If so, pls tell me how","I would not say I have overcome it, but I’ve gotten better about chunking my time. Like somehow my body *can* chunk time by days of the week. So instead of thinking “I have an appt. on June 6th, 2024,” my brain files it in a “Thursday” folder.

By “chunking time,” I mean dividing time into intervals instead of just a confusing jumbled mass of “time” like I normally would.

I have also realized that with some thought, I *can* divide time into present, future, and past. A lot of the stuff I had on my daily to-do lists actually had no business being there and was moved to a “future” list. My “present” list is now much shorter and more manageable (still too long though; the struggle is still real to narrow it down and prioritize effectively).

Also, storing stuff “by project” helps me. I want evvvverything I need for a given project in ONE place. Otherwise, I get sidetracked at the drop of a hat. Not very “minimalist” of me, but I’d rather get stuff done than try to perfect the right-size amount of files/stuff and then fall down a rabbit-hole because I actually do need something (e.g. data, a link, etc.) that did not make the initial cutoff for “essential” stuff."

"Is there any Adult here who struggled with time blindness, excessive tardiness, time management, productivity well into adulthood and then some how overcame it? If so, pls tell me how","Don’t know if this is good advice or not, but I stopped *doing* so many things and it helped a lot. 

Most my life I’d try to leverage the hyper attentiveness (unknowingly) and do everything, fit everything in to every possible hour, push life around to fit my special interests. Most often this would lead to burnout as I wasn’t able to maintain the pace, or missing important things that needed done.

Later in life when I was diagnosed, tried to leverage a routine per my counselor’s advice. Problem was, there were too many things pre-scheduled, I was still missing things all the time and stressing over them constantly. 

Once I changed to only doing one important *task* a day (note, not a project) things started to get easier. I could be distracted for more of my time (or as I like to think of it, letting my ADHD off the leash for a bit) but that one important thing has a better chance to get done with nothing around it.

Hope that helps 😅

Edit: Also I found taking one day a week to relax and be “cage free with my ADHD,” (let myself go wherever the ADHD takes me) also helped my focus the following week."

Well, now I'm starting to come in late again lol.

I'm really starting to hate my job, we've had a ton of layoffs and just the environment here sucks now. It used to be a fun little company, but now they can't afford anything and we no longer get raises or bonuses like we used to.

"Is there any Adult here who struggled with time blindness, excessive tardiness, time management, productivity well into adulthood and then some how overcame it? If so, pls tell me how","I’m 30 and was diagnosed at 28. Here are some things I discovered that have helped me.

• Set Alarms and Timers for literally everything. When to take your medicine, when you need to be out of the shower, when you should be dressed, when you should go to bed, etc. Figure out how long it takes you to get ready in the morning, add 30 min, and set your wake-up alarm accordingly. After a while, I got used to my routine and don’t need the constant alarms, but I still rely on medicine alarms and the extra time in the morning.

• Google Calendar. Every single appointment, significant date, meet-ups, family functions, even bill due dates should be marked on a digital calendar. I like Google calendar because I can stack multiple calendars into one, and I can make changes on the fly on my phone. I color-code my events based on category, red for family, pink for dr appointments, green for bills, etc. Of course, make alarms for each event, maybe even multiple alarms for non-routine events. I also have a dry-erase, magnetic calendar on my fridge that I use to write down shared events with my spouse.

• Take your medicine. I avoided medication for the longest time, and for no good reason. When I finally got on medication, I decided that I only needed it on days when I really needed to focus, like on a test day or a busy day at work. Screw that, take it every day (or however much your doctor prescribes you). Even on your days off so you can get some chores done.
EDIT: sorry I didn’t see that you’re taking adderall and don’t like it so much. I take modafinil, and it’s more of a steady fuel used by narcoleptics (I have mild narcolepsy), but it can also be used to stimulate the brain in the same way that adderall does. It might be worth talking to your doctor about.

• Have notepads all around you. I bought a pack of us-letter sized note pads designed for clipboards, and I just have one in every room in my apartment so I can organize my thoughts. And no, don’t use a digital device. Something magical happens when I hold a pen and literally write something down. I think it makes me focus about what I’m thinking about.

• Consider taking on obligations early in the morning. If you have a job that starts later in the day, having an obligation in morning keeps you from losing track of time. When I had a dog, I would have to get up early to feed her and take her out. Recently I took on a part-time job that I do in the mornings. This can easily backfire though, because being late for obligations before work can snowball into being late for your normal obligations. Don’t try this until you get a firm grip on your routine.

• EDIT: Adding Time limits on your phone! If you have an iPhone, you can set app limits and downtime so you’re not doomscrolling."

As far as time blindness goes, the only advice I have is that binaural beats/lofi music playing in the background has helped me stay on task.

I easily lose track of what needs to be done before I leave when I'm on a tight schedule. I run around like a headless chicken (this may be an expression only used in Dutch but you get the gist) or forget at least one important item.

When I do it the day before, it takes me a lot of time but at least I have time to spare. If it takes longer, I will be in bed a little later. Instead of always late on the appointment.

Hope this helps if you didn't already do that.

I do sometimes stress because my entire evening is gone with packing and I got a full day of work ahead. Kids sleep at 19.00, sometimes later, I want to get into bed at 23.00 so that's three hours for packing, cleaning dishes, getting ready for bed and relaxing. Time flies..."

So if I happened to show up early to something, that felt like failing my goal of trying to be exactly on time, because that early time felt wasted.


Once I explicitly set my goal to be 15 minutes early, when I did show up somewhere early, it felt like a success instead of a failure. I would play games on my phone or just relax during that time and tried to make it really positive.

"Is there any Adult here who struggled with time blindness, excessive tardiness, time management, productivity well into adulthood and then some how overcame it? If so, pls tell me how","I got this Casio watch that I can set a timer just by clicking a button for 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, or 30 min. When I look at my phone and think ok I need to start walking out the door in 5 min, I click the button 3 times. In 5 min I’ll probably be lost in my thoughts or starting some project but the watch will beep and I’ll start heading for the door. That works all day. 

What works in the morning is waking up with the exact amount of time I need to get ready, make the kid breakfast, get the kid ready, and be out the door to school. 

My time blindness happens when I have EXTRA time. Like on Saturday I woke up 20 min early for the gym, did not do my little watch trick, started doing several different extra things in addition to my morning routine (I had 20 extra min after all), then finally saw a clock in the kitchen and saw it was the time my workout class was starting!

"Is there any Adult here who struggled with time blindness, excessive tardiness, time management, productivity well into adulthood and then some how overcame it? If so, pls tell me how","Time is a resource, a very limited one. Time blindness makes it challenging for us to measure expected time per task. So my question is: How do you budget time? 

If you think: i need to be at work at 9am, it takes me 30 minutes to get there on a bad day, so i need to be out the door at 8:30. A potential solution is simply leave earlier (shift everything you do to an earlier time). A more likely to succeed option would be to pretend you need to be there at 8:45 every day. 

Really, the way to do this is to prioritize and measure. Its not easy. Draw a schedule and fill it in. What is involved in your morning routine (your personal one…), what stuff do you need to get done before you leave the house (make lunch for kids, clean dishes, make coffee - etc…), what do you need to do after you leave the house (drop kids off at school, pick up dry cleaning)? How much time do all of these individual things take you, on average?  Then fill in the schedule. 

Next step is to take each piece and ask yourself “does this need to happen in the morning?” Move anything you can to the night before. Stop doing unnecessary things first thing in the morning! No, you cant drop the kids off the night before; but you can make lunch the night before, or pick out clothes, etc…"

Tardiness, I put any appointment at least 30 min earlier than ""on time"" in the calendar. I usually end up ""actually"" on time instead of late

Stop aiming for being on time and aim to be 15-30 minutes early. 

Only do the things when you are getting ready to go that are related to you getting to where you're going. Grab lunches, refill water bottle, take meds, put on shoes. 
(No phone scrolling, no tidying up real quick etc) 

I'm very very rarely ever late for anything anymore. And I'm also rarely TOO early anymore either. For years I would show up too early because I'd either be too early or late and I wasn't willing to spend my whole day feeling like I failed because I showed up late. It caused me much more prolonged anxiety when I was late to things and even if i was told ""its not a big deal. Just don't do it again"" I wouldn't be able to stop thinking about it."

I now know that in most cases, so long as I've showered the night before, I can be ready to leave in 30 min or less.  That means, whenever I want to arrive, I subtract the travel time plus 5 minutes for extra traffic, and 30 min before that is when I need to ""get ready to leave"". If I do this I will usually be on time within 5 min.  If I don't do this I will usually be late. 

As for external motivators, I need to be meeting someone.  I never leave on time because it's good for me.  Getting to leave early, looking good at work, knowing I won't have enough time to finish work if I don't arrive early enough, none of these are reliable motivators, I frequently self sabotage for no reason so the consequences to myself aren't a good motivation for me.

I wish I could love a lax on-time arrival to my gym, a date with my partner, or going to work, but instead I'm in a high-stakes speeding competition to shave a couple minutes off.

So far it's caused a dubious amount of issues for me, but nothing long-lasting enough that I remember for more than a couple days. I'm sure everyone around me understands quite well: I'm not one for being on time.

I wish I could value and feel good about when I'm early. But there's no reward for it. Only punishment for being late."
"Is there any Adult here who struggled with time blindness, excessive tardiness, time management, productivity well into adulthood and then some how overcame it? If so, pls tell me how","For me it’s been a combination of things other people have already said. 
*Figuring out how long things actually take and building in buffers helps. When I put things on my calendar I put a note and alarms to be in the shower by x time, out of the door by x time etc. Not for everything but for important things and for first time things. Eventually it gets baked in but on ‘bad’ days (I’m not medicated) I’ll set a timer/alarm at 10 min increments on my phone just as a way of reminding myself to keep moving from task to task. 
*Growing tired of the feeling of panic and shame of always being late and realising that while that level of chaos was just my ‘normal’ (see also the stimming comments) it didn’t have to be forever but it would take time and effort to figure out a new way. I also grew up with undiagnosed parents rushing for everything all the time and I hated that feeling. I also lived with an undiagnosed person for years and just found that level of chaos around travel times etc so exhausting that I didn’t want to a) do that to myself anymore or b) inflict that on anyone else. Also the idea that for ‘early’ people my lateness came across as me being disrespectful of their time or valuing my time more than theirs really bothered me. 
*There was a period of time where I realised all this but still couldn’t figure out how to actually do anything differently so I’d just put things in my calendar for 15-30 min earlier than they actually were. 
*Even with all this, I’m still a person with severe ADHD who is sometimes late but being more self compassionate with myself has ironically made it easier to be more consistently early."
"Is there any Adult here who struggled with time blindness, excessive tardiness, time management, productivity well into adulthood and then some how overcame it? If so, pls tell me how","A few things have helped me immensely with this. I have 2 absolute time cut offs.  A) I have to be out of bed at a certain time to help get my kids ready for school and get them there on time. This cut off out of bed time is not the last possible minute either.  The out of bed time allows a reasonable amount of time to get our stuff done, eat breakfast, make lunches, find anything (if it wasn't done the night before)...which brings us to B. B) I have a 'firm, we have to leave the house' time.  If hair isn't brushed, oh well. If they didn't help get their lunch ready, they are eating school lunch... and there is still a buffer in there as well.  Giving us those firm times has really helped us. I found this to drastically cut down fighting and stress with my girls (7&9) and we have been late a couple of times since implementation but its more the 'first bell rang late' and not 'pick up a tardy slip' late.  



Two other things that have really helped me with GMST: 1) My mindset has changed so I now look at making changes to some of my ADHD behaviors to these changes being good self care. I like not dropping my kids off late, I enjoy mornings with my girls much more now.  That mindset shift of changing my behavior is good for me and I want to take care of myself has been very helpful.  2) Trying different medications to find one that truly works for you is also really helpful.  All of the ones Ive tried helped some but finding the one that works BEST for you will help with all of the other stuff.  It gave me more energy to care and make the changes I needed to make. No medication is perfect and some days are still more of a struggle but overall, its made a big impact.  Sometimes it takes a few tries before you find the best one. 

Good luck with everything! Cheering you on!"

Bulletjournal app and ToDo app help me keep track of tasks and bills. ToDo helps by setting a bill reminder and putting it monthly and seeing it whenever you want. you can make a thumb to view it on your main screen and open right up.

For excessive tardiness, I had to start looking at it as 'time is the most valuable currency there is'.  I have to give it value by putting myself in other's shoes - I have a friend that is literally THE WORST when it comes to being on time.  We will wait around for him FOR HOURS.  Eventually, I sat him down and talked to him about it and how it made me feel.  Nothing changed.  Eventually it made me realize how little respect he has for me and my own time.  Now I don't want to make anyone feel the way he made/makes me feel.  
In turn - this prospective can be easily skewed when it comes to a job .. especially if it's a soul-sucking one like most.

I work as a teacher (first time ever) and it is extremely hard to keep up brcause its like stuff changes every time or everywhere you turn. 

It's caused me to fuck up a lot on the job, to where admin is enraged with me.
I got time blind with a test I was supposed to administer and the tickets were messed up and..... yeah its not good for me friend. 


What I try to do so I can get to work on time is try to aim to leave at an earlier time than when I actually leave because I have a long drive to work.

Ex: I aim to leave at 6:00, but I end up leaving at 6:20 
Aim for 6:20-25 but I leave at 6:40-45 and speed so I can get there to have a decent parking space.

I also have hella alarms, like 7 of them to wake me up in the morning bc I just wont naturally do it. College turned me into a night owl and even a few years on, I still am more..""active"" at night than I am during the day. But the night activity is limited because I'm tired from working early on in the day.

Lesson planning was a big, still is a big beast to deal with. But I did ask for help and someone sent me a template so my stuff is more organized on paper even though I still do double the work bc I break down what I understood from the curriculum in my journal.

To help assist with that I had to flip throuvh a lot of things:

Playing ocean sounds + an aviation podcast and [orchestral music](https://youtu.be/D9km3yXmR8k?si=3yr4Vck_HrW9K0O6)
Sometimes just a song  at a moderately slow pace that does not get me hype  on repeat
Sometimes having to do body doubling

If so, pls tell me how","Agh I am right there with you and could have written this. I tried wellbutrin first and now vyvanse which is from the Adderall family, and at first thought I was going to finally be able to function! But I still can't. And the crash from vyvanse lasts into the morning so I'm sleeping through alarms now, like fully not noticing them whatsoever. Really passed off my man this weekend when he finally wanted to sleep in and usually can't, and my alarm kept going off every 15 mins and I wouldn't wake up til he called my name multiple times and nudged me. Ugh. At first I was so paranoid about being on time for my kids school I was panic getting ready early and getting there just ahead of time. Now we're consistently 5-10 mins late. This morning was 15. 😓

I've been fired from multiple jobs for my adhd, which I didn't know I had until the last couple years, whether from being always late, or not being able to make myself do certain tasks and not knowing why, so I'd avoid them until I absolutely had to, or constantly needing to ask my supervisor what I should be doing next cause I couldn't work it out myself, what was the most logical task to do next. I always hated asking him and felt so bad and ashamed, even though he was nice about it. Whatever it is, it always feels so exciting and great for the first little bit, then I crash and burn. I start to dread little things about it, more, and more, until I absolutely hate my whole job and want to avoid it at all costs, which likely contributes to being late! Lol

Thanks for posting this, I'll be looking for some new strategies for sure cause I thought finally giving in and trying medication would mean I'd finally be able to do things, and I feel so defeated now that I'm still a mess. It just all feels like too much sometimes, like today when my kids were extra crazy. Ugh."

"Is there any Adult here who struggled with time blindness, excessive tardiness, time management, productivity well into adulthood and then some how overcame it? If so, pls tell me how","I've just learned that I never have as much time to do things as I think I do. I've gotten very conservative about engaging in tasks or behaviours before I have to be somewhere or do something. I don't enjoy running late and it makes me feel stress, so it's been helpful to do this, although it's still sometimes difficult. (Just last Friday I ended up late for a medical appointment because I was pretty sure I still had time after an all-morning meeting to grab lunch, and there ended up being a big lineup at the drive-through of the restaurant I chose.)

This paid off great for another appointment I had the next day because I actually got there early, realized I'd forgotten the paperwork I needed, came home, got it, returned and I was still there exactly on time. Again, I wasn't happy with myself but I was still punctual.

Use your willpower and say no to yourself. Remember that if you are on time for something, you'll be back sooner and you'll have additional time to do the task that was really drawing your attention. And understand that it takes time, effort and practice to start to make noticeable differences in your behaviours.

One thing I can add - I have a person in my life that is extremely time-blind and it is quite infuriating at times. It feels disrespectful. I know that that is not the person's intention, but become aware of the effects you are having on the people around you and it might be easier to attain the mental energy level necessary to modify your behaviours."

"Is there any Adult here who struggled with time blindness, excessive tardiness, time management, productivity well into adulthood and then some how overcame it? If so, pls tell me how","Yuuuup. I realized at some point that I was stimming off the adrenaline and stress of rushing everywhere, but it was really unhealthy. Now I try to have an stress-free philosophy, and whenever I find myself trying to fit too many things in or making choices that I know future me will hate, I try to look for another way. I do think that for me, meds (I’m on Focalin) help in the sense that they help my brain get out of the murk and see the bigger picture, and make decisions for the future. I can’t say I’m perfect at it.

Also, I am very much not a morning person and OP it sounds like you aren’t either. Especially with the gym — like I know I will never, ever wake up early to go the gym, I will turn off the alarm and snuggle down 99 percent of the time. Maybe try working out at lunch? Or if you can’t make it to the gym, try a walk around the block and some minor strength training in the morning just to get the endorphies moving?

I feel like a combo of meeting myself where I actually am, and recognizing and getting fed up with these bigger patterns (I don’t actually enjoy the feeling of cortisol rushing thru my body) made me able to create a routine that, if I don’t stick to every day, I can at least keep myself on a reasonable track.

Our distractions arent stupid or unimportant, but they don’t need to be done right now, or they can be done later. But I will still get sucked in and then I yell a “prioritize!” to stop myself. Also, what’s become helpful for me is having multiples of everything, chargers in every room and in my car, shoes at the door & garage & my car, a “uniform” for work (black or white shirt and jeans) same everyday, so I don’t have to think about what I’m going to wear and can easily lay it out the night before. Emergency makeup in my car and at work. If I know I have these things, I can eliminate some time off getting ready. I can do makeup at the red lights. If I drive to work in slippers, I have shoes in my car. 
I still cut it close, but I’m doing so much better than I was 10years ago. *Agree with the multiple alarm clocks. Also, put an alarm in your bathroom, once you have to go in and shut it off multiple times, you can just start by peeing while you’re up and in there, then might as well brush your teeth or hair since you’re already in there.

If so, pls tell me how","I, at times have had the same issues with arriving late, however I started giving myself credit for even going when my brain was hyperfixated on other things.  

With my ADHD, my being ontime or being late really has more to do with what I am dealing with for the meeting then what I don't want to deal with, however need to make an appearance.  This has been a learned flaw in myself as for years, I couldn't figure out why I had such a variance on how I did meet ups or social gatherings.  (This is minus the, OH wow, I forgot to do this and it has to be done an hour ago, which then leads to lateness.)

Then you might have this thought like myself...

To me, a 1 or more hour drive seems like forever and will most likely make me not go, however once I go, my brain gets the visual simulation it needs to make me happy by driving.  I know this, but still have issues getting started.  I get happy feelings when I can drive and drive safely and not let others affect how they are driving.  I know I drive well and enjoy the time of music and mind clearance.  I will also use the time to talk to my windshield any issues I might soon deal with, like talking to someone about an issue or responding to some constructive critisism.  Hearing my voice helps re-enforce my thoughts so I don't sound like an idiot as anxiety starts to creep in and sounding like a fool when having such convos.

You have to put being on time at the very top of your list and other things will get sacrificed. Once it’s up there, you’ll make the right choices to make it happen, several alarms, saying no to too many commitments, whatever it takes. And when you aren’t going to be on time, calling it immediately is a nice way to hold yourself accountable and stay reliable to others. I’m always late, it drives me nuts. But when I have been good about timing, it was all the little steps (earlier sleep, alarms, no to too many, adding a 15 min handicap, setting Waze travel early) that summed up to just making it the main focus and a “value”.

Then i switched. I love focalin. I kinda don’t notice it, just that after I take it I am suddenly better at executive functioning and the obstacles that seem everywhere are lowered. I wouldn’t say it “works” as well as the speed drugs, the focus is less intense as is the high, but it feels more sustainable for me in the long run."

I wonder what her work schedule is like, honestly getting up two hours early is the cure for most issues with getting ready on time. Tough to find that kind of time before work, if it’s really an early job "

I’ve described it as helping my brain “get out of the basement” and on it I am able to see patterns and systems I couldn’t see before and help me make better decisions. It also just makes doing things easier. For example I have a countertop dishwasher that takes 3 pitchers of water to run and filling those pitchers feels like FOREVER so I never used it annd always had dishes piled up. When I take Focalin I just fill it up, it’s like a minute, it’s not a big deal. 

 What it doesn’t do, and what I miss, is the hyper focus. Focalin doesn’t help me sit down for hours and get something done. What it does do is enable me to start the thing, and to notice and get myself back on track when I get distracted. 

 So it’s kind of a different vibe, I miss that part of Adderall but this feels much healthier to me, personally. Everyone is different though! Hope this helps!"

Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"Stop going to pharmacies like CVS, Walgreens, Rite Aid, etc. Send your prescriptions to supermarkets, or maybe Walmart. 

The difference in prices are absurd and confirm that our healthcare system is a complete fraud."
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"In my area, GoodRx has the brand at $370 and the generic at $80.  That's no insurance. 

For me, with insurance, brand used to be $80 and generic is now $10."
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"Formulary adjustments come out quarterly. Most likely your insurance hasn’t called out the generic version yet. October 1 *should* have the new adjustments to include generic but make sure brand is still covered (if it isn’t, write an appeal) because it will be hit or miss whether your pharmacy of choice has generic."
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"Yeah, even at a grocery store pharmacy, they told me it was $300 before insurance, while brand was $800 before insurance. 😬"

Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,This thread just made me so depressed. How do you pay over $100 every month!? That is so disgusting. It's not like we ask for these conditions or have a choice. It's so exploitative! I hate this system.
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"If you are in the USA 

You can also ask the pharmacist ""how much would this be without using my insurance?""

A lot of times the ""normal"" price is actually more expensive for ppl using insurance (damn contracts with insurance agencies... ughhhhh). My friend is a pharmacist and she said a lot of times going without insurance can actually be cheaper. (?!?!) But you have to proactively ask the pharmacist because they're not legally allowed to tell you unless you ask specifically (more rage ensues)

I tried this with modafinal (narcolepsy med)... it costs $90 using my insurance Co pay. When I didn't run it thru my insurance it was $45 💀💀 what a fucked up system we have in the USA"

so if any of you live near the border, might be worth it!"

Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"Absolutely hate CVS, Walgreens, etc.

Those generic meds should be 30 USD and under my friend. Don't be loyal to those damn companies they are blood sucking hard, especially with changes going on in the market the past few years.

I do my local grocery store chain in the state, and not only do I see and talk to every pharmacist, they are actually personable and answer any questions. Last visit they told me that the generic was coming and the main Vyvanse site is discontinuing their coupon by the end of the year. I didn't even ask! Lol"
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"Never use CVS. It's ALWAYS the most expensive retail pharmacy, even with GoodRx. I say this as a CVS pharmacy tech 😂 Grocery stores and Costco are where it's at. You also don't need to be a member to use the Costco pharmacy or to buy alcohol there."

Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,what the fuck. Elvanse from Shire costs 8€ a bottle in Germany
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"It’s going to be. Worked as a pharmacy tech for longer than I ever should’ve, once a medication goes generic it takes about 8~ months to become reasonable. I saw that with Crestor, saw it with Bystolic. Still hugely expensive at first but took a dip once the market stabilized.

Just an add on to the fun, insurance will likely flip to wanting to pay for the generic only, when it’s hardly readily available. Saw that with most recently the Tresiba pens, nothing like scrambling to get a bunch of overrides for insulin when our warehouse has 2 boxes of the generic."
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"At CVS my Vyvanse is $390. At the local grocery pharmacy it is $270 before my insurance kicks in for the year, then it’s only $30. Generic is $10. 

Also CVS refuses to use the manufacturer coupon which actually reduces the price to around $30 without insurance if I remember correctly. But the manufacturer coupon has to be run without your regular insurance. Someone fact check me if I’m wrong.

I’ve spent so many days crying out of pure frustration just from the sheer work it takes at the beginning of each year to cover my med costs with the new coupon/insurance costs. 

And sometimes my doc still accidentally sends meds to CVS and I’m fucked anyway. 

FUCK YOU CVS."
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"It’s so weird, my partner’s on Vyvanse and our insurance apparently has decided not to cover the generic at all. Previously, we had to pay almost the entire cost of Vyvanse (without a coupon / prior auth), at $300/mo. 

Now the generic is out, that’s not covered, and Vyvanse brand has become a “tier 1” and now costs $10/mo. Wtf."
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,Goodrx can tell you the prices of the stores near you even if you don't use them.
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"It is all just part of the game that has been created between pharamceutical companies, pharmacies, and insurance providers.

All of the reality is hidden from us and they pretend like it is hidden from the others... but they all know what is going on.  In reality, people try to pin the blame on insurance companies, but all parties are complicit in the BS.  They all do everything that they can.  The pharmas jack up their ""list price"" so that the pharmacies havee to negotiate... then the pharmacies work their deals trying to pass along the inflated price to insurance companies... then the other part of the negotiation comes in.  They keep passing around these garbage numbers when the amount of cash changing hands is probably within a few dollars of your copay.

On a side note: the real reason our insurance has suffered over the past couple of decades has been because of interest rates approaching zero.  Now that they have returned to previously normal levels... I unfortunately do not expect it to get fixed.  The reason before was that insurance companies basically operated primarily off of the interest they would generate by holding onto a boat load of money on an average basis.  So, when a normal savings account generates \~5%, any sort of company that basically manages the flow of money can generate a lot of income from that.  As the interest rates tanked, our insurance went to utter garbage.  Prior to this, insurance was both more affordable and worked a lot better for people.  I remember the insurance that I had in 1999-2000... I didn't pay any premiums for coverage through work and my copays were zero (work entirely covered the premiums since they were so affordable).  Oh how things change."

Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"I paid $720 last month for my Vyvanse. My insurance is horrible. I applied for assistance through help at hand, and since my income is low, I've always had a free coupon for my monthly vyvanse. Due to the shortage, I had to change from 30 60mg a month, to 30mg 2x a day, they wouldn't apply my coupon to 30 of the pills and it was $720. I went without. This is insanity."
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,It’ll come down over the next year. Pretty standard
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"Co-pay on the generic for me is $70, same as the name brand. But I have a coupon for the name brand that brings it down to $15. The coupon does not work on the generic. Nobody can fill the name brand right now. I can't afford a $70 co-pay.

TLDR - No Vyvanse for me because of the generic."
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"Oof. I fill at a grocery store (Publix) and my copay went from $25 for name brand to $7 for generic. Haven't started using the generic as I still had a few of the name brand left, but hoping there aren't any odd side effects."

Without insurance. CVS price was still in the 90s both with and without insurance it’s insaneeee

Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,I only fill my prescriptions at a supermarket chain in my state. Even though my shit health insurance doesn't recognize them I pay $14 for a month supply of 20mg generic Adderall x2 a day so 60 pills.

Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"Amazing! When I signed up for express scripts last year, Vyvanse wasn't on the list of medications they'd ship.

Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"How does Vyvance compare to Adderall? Does it work better? Does it feel different? Is it safer than Adderall if you have elevated blood pressure? If you've taken both, tell me what your experience has been and how they compare.  I have Medi-Cal, and they cover Adderall but my doctor said I can't use it anymore because my blood pressure is elevated. What else can I take that's actually effective.

Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"Apologies if I’m repeating from another comment but the company offers a coupon you can sign up for and use for a bunch of times, it’s dropped my price by over 100 sometimes (I have an HSA) I’m not sure of the exact rules but it should be directly on the Vyvanse website"

Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,I'm confused. How much do you get for this price? My prescription in Germany costs about 7€ for 30 x 50mg caps Elvanse (german name for Vyvanse from Shire). Woithout insurance it would cost 90€ at the pharmacy.
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"NEVER use CVS or Walgreens. They overcharge and make you wait ridiculous lengths of time for literally no reason. Last time I was in a CVS I spent 10-20 minutes there, and there was a long line that I wasn't in, at the prescription counter. It never moved once. I use a grocery store pharmacy, there's never a line, and it takes them under two minutes. CVS and Walgreens do not deserve the customers they have."

Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"Does your insurance have a website where you can search for your meds and see the estimated price? When I took citalopram, it was legitimately $150 at cvs and $4 at Walmart.

Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"I'm interested to hear if you or anyone are now unable to get their Vyvanse because of the generics being released. My insurance will not pay name brand since the generics are now on the market, however, the pharmacies in my area are having trouble getting the generics because of demand. So I can't get my medication right now because insurance companies are awful and don't offer some sort of transition period or something."
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,CVS is one of the most expensive places to get any prescription. Use good rx ti find the cheapest
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"Idk about CVS, but they tried to charge me at Publix an amount that I knew was wrong, and they reduced it  from $90 something down to $14 and change. This was when my insurance hadn’t kicked in yet. You have nothing to lose by declaring it’s a mistake or whatever. Always argue. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. CVS might well be the place where it doesn’t. They have always been particularly soulless."

Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,I have insurance and VA Medicaid. I was also using the vyvanse coupons. I walked away with a $0 copay but now they are only carrying generic and 1. They can’t fill the full prescription so I’m 10 short. 2. My copay was $100. So I actually pay more for generic…
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"Quelbree is what I am on now.. and my insurance that forces me to use CVS with No exceptions, won't cover it.  CVS didn't fill my first scrip with it, because it was $36 a single Pill.   
A months supply was more than my Mortgage, I didn't want them to fill it at that rate.

I’ve had one that was $10 at a supermarket and $300 plus at CVS/Walgreens and others were almost flipped. Not quite as egregious but still hundreds of dollars

Sometimes it even depends on specific locations. Prices fluctuate between CVS locations as well

Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"Yep, I was in Pharma sales and had a product go generic. We kept selling, even though it was available for other places to manufacture, mainly because it took them so long to lower their prices, and for competition to catch up and ramp up production. Basic supply demand curve until any of the super low-cost generic manufacturers get in on the game."

I pay $200\~ per year for **all** of my medication every year. $200 is the cap for anyone, I reach that cap rather quickly - and then pay nothing for 10\~ months. If I get a specific brand instead of generic/whatever is cheapest (mostly if the doctor forgets to write the prescription for the brand I want) it's normally a question about paying up to maybe a dollar per month extra"

Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,Vyvanse is an inactivated form of Dexedrine - it's 100% dextroamphetamine that is slowly released into the bloodstream via an enzyme in the blood. It's smoother than and has milder physiological effects than Adderall as Adderall is 25% levoamphetamine - the more activating side of the amphetamine molecule.
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"Vyvanse is the prodrug of adderall, so basically your body creates amphetamine when it is metabolized. It’s not as “harsh” as adderall imo and is a more subtle effect. It works really well for me personally, but it’s different for everyone. 

If you’re worried about blood pressure, try amoxetine. You can take it by itself or in combination with a stimulant. Normally you can take a lower dose if you combine the two."
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"I tried Adderall XR. It has 4 methods of delayed time release. I could feel every one of them when it hit. I never ""feel"" Vyvanse take effect or go away. It's very smooth. But it's the same drug as Adderall. The delivery method is all that's different."

Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"Not obscene.  Walmart is using their pharmacy as a ""loss leader"".  They are indeed losing money on you filling your medications there.  The pharmacy becomes what marketers call a ""sticky"" relationship because you will keep walking into the store to get your medications filled.  They are counting on you walking in and buying other stuff.  Does it work out?  Largely, it does.  Sure, you might say that maybe you don't do that, but that is anecdoctal and not representative of ""most people"".

They do get some pricing advantages due to their size, but I don't it is really that big of a deal compared to the other pharmacies because they buy a lot of drugs, too.

EDIT: I am not suggesting that you shouldn't take advantage of it, though.  Do what makes sense for your financial situation, indeed."

Otherwise, if you live anywhere near a Costco, definitely try them. You don’t need a membership to use their pharmacy, and for about 5-6 different medications, I have paid 1/4-1/10 of the price I was paying at Walgreens."

Previous to that it was still about the same price as name brand for me."

Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"For me it was kinda hard. First no teachers of me ever had the suspicion that I had ADHD (although I went to 8 schools and was mediocre to say it nice although I had an IQ of 133 when I was 7 years old). I was the first person that had the suspicion when I was 20 and than it took around half a year… 

First I went to a psychiatrist but he told me that I had to make the test in a psychiatry. So I made an appointment there (it was February 2020) for April but than COVID came… I though I will never get a diagnosis and due to other things in my life I developed a severe depression (was depressed before but not to that degree) and was hospitalised in a privat psychiatric clinic. There it took around a month to get all the testing done which was in July 2020. 

First I was medicated with Ritalin but there was a patient that was a psychiatrist in his regular life (the psychiatry was mainly for addicted physicians). He told me about Vyvanse and how good it is but in Germany there is the rule that you first have to use Ritalin before you are allowed to get Vyvanse prescribed. I think in October 2020 I had an appointment with him and than I finally got Vyvanse.

For me Vyvanse is some kind of miracle because I went from a Highschool dropout to soon study medicine because I love to work in hospitals (had an apprenticeship in an operation theatre). I love to have all that contact to people which I didn’t had before and I need the pressure that working in healthcare is associated with. A regular job would make me depressed because only in times when I have pressure from outside are the times I feel really happy. But that’s a family thing of mine… my dad and grandfather both are workaholics and my grandfather even worked until he was 89 (he was a multimillionaire but needed work to have a purpose in his life) 

And now I noticed how I’m over sharing informations but that is a symptom of my ADHD hahaha"
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"In this instance I'm referring to generic birth control and antibiotics. I've never tried to fill my generic Adderall at Walgreens specifically for this reason, though.

Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"Sometimes your insurance will have uniquely good pricing. My generic adderall XR was $417 without insurance, $170 with insurance, then all the sudden dropped to $110 when generic vyvanse came out."
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"I live in the greater New Orleans area. Lots of little local pharmacies even 45 minutes away. The big local discount chain is A1, and then there are a good several family pharmacies, etc. Then we also have just about every major chain.

ETA: Also local grocery chains with their own pharmacies, but those chains are getting bought out and dying."
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"Oh I didn't think you were suggesting anything!

It definitely makes sense, specifically because it's one of the main advertisers of their pharmacy to have such low cost generics. I just remember being blown away years ago filling my generic birth control where I worked (Walgreens) and they wanted to charge me $80?? I was like um...no that's okay 😂 walked it right back over to Walmart for $9. That was ridiculous.

And I do use going into Walmart as an excuse to maybe grab candy or my favorite chips as they're the only store that sells them. Otherwise I go anywhere else at any opportunity lol."

Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"Neat, I can’t watch it right now but I’ll take your word for it. I was going off the official website of the FDA which says:

Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,Huh. This could be a real game changer for some people. Thx for sharing tip.
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"Vyvanse in THEORY should be a lot less susceptible to variations than other meds. It’s what’s called a prodrug, so your body is basically making the drug when you metabolize it. It may have different side effects and take longer or shorter to kick in based on the fillers used, but theoretically it shouldn’t have a problem.

I just got the generic today so I haven’t tried it yet. If I remember, I’ll update tomorrow morning when I try it."
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"I would assume you might need to play with the dose a bit. I have had some serious differences in efficacy* between adderall generics and was told they can be up to 20% different than name brand.

I was titrated on Teva/Activis and when switched to Camber it was at least 50% less effective. This was on 50mg XR."

Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"I do want to note that OP is discussing the generic cost without insurance. My pre-generic Vyvanse with insurance was $40 for a 30 day supply. It was $15 as a generic.

When I was on state insurance in the US (in a state literally known for its inhumane health insurance and disdain for government “handouts”), my Vyvanse was almost if not free. The main issue was I had to go through two other ADHD medications before it would be approved (generic Adderall and Cymbalta), which was about two months of back and forth with my PCP. 

US insurance is designed to fuck the middle class, and it does suck for many reasons, but I’m constantly scratching my head at people dropping the retail prescription amounts for standard generic therapies and acting like paying that is the norm here. It’s just not? 

This doesn’t negate the fact insurance in the US is a nightmare and many draconian private insurance companies didn’t cover brand name Vyvanse, but this was incredibly misleading. Even OP admitted they only paid $10 for their prescription with insurance. 

At the end of the day, for US citizens, generic Vyvanse is still a massive win and going to change many lives. Scaring people with the retail cost of a generic is kinda uncool since the whole point is generics are almost universally covered by all insurance companies and will cost the copay amount, not the retail amount.

Idk. I’m venting here. I’m just miffed at the thought of OP discouraging people with ADHD from attempting to access these meds. I’m certain it wasn’t intentional, but we all know it doesn’t take much to discourage us from trying new things and this might have dissuaded someone from calling their doctor since it’s ‘all the same.’ It’s not. At all."
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"It depends on your insurance provider and what medical go on what list the put it on (yes, it's stupid).

It's weird, but my insurance plan provides its pharmaceutical portion of it through a completely separate ""program"" which is literally CVS. It'd still fill in other pharmacies, but I think it ""guarantees"" less CVS BS on the business side of CVS. Think it's still doing stupid stuff on the insurance side, but i guess it's like ""CVS Premium"", which I don't like the idea of, but it's what my work provides. 

It covers Gen. Vyvanse as 10 bucks a month."

Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"I have a similar insurance where once I spend $3,000 out of pocket, everything is covered (I also don’t have to pay for bimonthly or monthly premiums). If I use GoodRX, that $ spent doesn’t count towards the $3,000. However, I’d recommend comparing the cost savings from Good Rx or Costco, compared to paying 3-5x more and having it go towards your deductible. There definitely is a “break even point” where it makes more sense to pay more out of pocket at CVS, but if you can save like 50% on your prescription by going outside of your insurance, you are better off with a cheaper pharmacy option or GoodRX"
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"You can submit the amount paid to your insurance to count toward your deductible. They may apply it to your out of network deductible (if they separate Rx costs as in or out), but say least you'll get credit."

Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"That is true, but it’s a tricky statement. A person’s copay could be more than what the GoodRx cost … so GoodRx could save you money even if you have insurance. But they never say both can be utilized at the same time. It is illegal for some insurance company for you to use a discount coupon. Healthcare is tricky - I’ve worked as a pharmacy auditor and my wife is a pharmacist.

From their website: Keep in mind that you cannot use GoodRx and insurance at the same time.

https://www.goodrx.com/insurance-and-goodrx"
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"Ooooh I see what you are saying now. What the insurance company is being billed as the cost of of the generic is nearly the same cost as name brand. 

I’m a chemist so I have a little background in this (admittedly it has been years since I worked a formulary chemist position in undergrad). Pharmaceutical companies can bill generics at a higher cost for a determined amount of time to recoup some of the costs associated with development/scale up. What is even more interesting is that most large companies have their own generic divisions who are poised to take on the manufacturing of those medications (and charge the exact same amount for an additional 2-3 years!) 

This is also why insurance companies sometimes don’t cover a new generic as a generic right away."
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"For real. I was having to do the one thing a person with ADHD shouldn't have to do without some sort of medication: making a list and calling everyone on the list until I was successful. I don't have that kind of focus! I'm a textbook example of ""wildly uncontrolled ADHD"" without my meds--no focus, immediate short-term memory loss (hell! try to have a conversation with me![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|dizzy_face)), inability to organize myself, crying all the time... And to have to \*search\* for my meds was almost impossible for me. So, when I found out that I could actually have it filled at the hospital Rx--and they HAD IT--I literally broke down and cried tears of relief."
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,Thanks! That would be much appreciated. I'm picking mine up tomorrow so I'm going to try it Tuesday.
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"You can request brands btw! I request Teva when I get my albuterol refilled. There’s a specific name to it that’s slightly different. 

The way I personally do it is I get my doctor to write a prescription for it using the EXACT wording it shows in the wallgreens app. You can also ask the pharmacy who makes it to confirm. 

I definitely agree though teva IR adderall is the best hands down. It’s not as big of a deal for ADHD meds, but if I get generic Albuterol from other manufacturers it straight up does not work as well which is kinda an issue when you can’t breathe lol."

Here in Germany I pay ~11€ for 4 months of 20mg Ritalin Adult at every pharmacy thanks to our national healthcare insurance.

The other ADHD medications have the same price limit here."
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"Don’t forget to use the coupon on the manufacturers website. Mine was 40, down to $15 with that"
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"You're getting a good deal! I'm in Canada, have some cover through my work (I pay a few dollars a week for), have the discount card, and it's still $75 for two months (32.50/month). I guess it's a bit cheaper for me due to CAD/USD, but I'm still surprise dhow much your insurance can cover in the USA. Seems like a great deal. I guess mg makes a difference too"
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,Yeah I poked around on GoodRx and the cheapest I can get it is like $60 around me which is some BS.
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"Oof, yeah. I grew up in a town that size and I think we had Walmart, CVS, and Walgreens as options. That area only recently got its own ""hospital"" in the past decade too, and it's not even that far. Craziness."
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,If I also wasn't paying weekly copays for therapy and physical therapy that likely would work out but so many damn medical bills.
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"You definitely can in my state (Virginia), though I'm not sure how other states break down. 

(It surprised me, too.)"
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,In my experience pharmacies don’t even usually reply about this over the phone. Which makes the whole thing totally over the top crazy.
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"Not to be dramatic but this stuff rules. It doesn’t have the same kick and “wired” feeling you normally get when it starts working. It’s a lot more subtle. I honestly didn’t think it was working until I realized I got up, ate, and started to get ready without spending an hour on my phone between each transition. 

I can see why people wouldn’t like this version if they like that initial feeling of their meds kicking in. It also took longer to start working than normal. Name brand Vyvanse would consistently do something about an hour after I took it, and fully kick in two hours later. This one did nothing for an hour and a half and then it **really** worked. 

Mine was made by Mallinckrodt."
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,Yeah my SO works for a pharmaceutical company and has confirmed generics are NOT the same efficacy wise & advised me to always go brand. Confirmed my suspicions since I always have iffy side effects to generic but never brand.
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"See. That's EVEN better. To find cheaper, non-insured prices.

Also, I've seen ""Good RX"" do some pretty good discounts, especially for generics."
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"Without any insurance, my psyche meds (generic Adderall, Wellbutrin, and Zoloft) has ALWAYS been cheaper at Walgreens than they have at Walmart. And believe me, I've checked several different times. Basically, anytime I've moved to a new city, which happens every couple years. There's times where Meijer or even Rite-Aid has been cheaper than Walgreens for me, but never has Walmart offered me the lowest price possible."
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,It is. Everyone at every level is taking a cut for themselves. Everything is based off backroom deals when it comes to pricing. It’s fucked.
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,Wow in Ireland I pay ~ €45 a month
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"You speak the truth, we like to pretend our shitty systems are the best in the world, it is a weird American obsession :)"
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"A fraud?  In some respects, yes.  The things that people think of on the surface aren't the real issues, though.

In terms of medications... part of the reason things cost so much is indeed because of other countries' systems.  The countries negotiate their pricing and say that if you don't meet our demands we will invalidate your patents within our borders.  So, they are forced to do so.  In reality, everything has a cost whether you see it come out of your pocket/paycheck, or not.  So, all of those hefty R&D expenses and costs related to regulatory approval... they still exist.  So, we pay a higher price here and are effectively subsidizing the world's medications.  You're welcome!  (mostly joking there).

Any regulated industry gets put into a really tight situation because these are external costs forced onto them.  Bureaucracy and process around compliance are rather significant and the general attitude from politicians is just to ""deal with it"".  There should be some real effort put into place to figure out ways to improve the processes and reduce the friction in order to help keep costs lower while meeting the desired outcomes imposed by introducing regulation (safety and quality being of paramount importance).  But, out of sight, out of mind... since we don't see that side of it and there are lots of people making lots of money because they're ""experts"" in navigating the bureaucracy, there is little incentive to do anything about it."
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"I pay $20.00 for name brand Vyvanse, and $5.00 for generic. My Adderall XR was also $5.00 before I changed. 

This is $20 for 4 months. The issue with America's system is the people who don't have good insurance through work. Most of us don't pay the truely ridiculous prices, we just see the theoretical bill. 

Our system has many problems, however for most people it isn't something that is bothering them in their normal life. 

Germany spent [11.7](https://healthsystemsfacts.org/national-health-systems/bismarck-model/germany/germany-health-system-expenditures/) of its GDP onHealthcare in 2020. The US spent [18.3%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/184968/us-health-expenditure-as-percent-of-gdp-since-1960/) in 2021. The main reason is our physician salaries are more than double other high income countries, and our administration is out of control (according to the STATA link I provided at least.) 

The biggest fear I have of a public system in the USA is that the administration and physicians will seize the opportunity to grow even more out of control, while most people won't see the cost so won't know of the problem. We need to get healthcare administration and physicians at a price point comparable to the rest of the world, lowering the cost, before implement a system that will reward the pricks and enable them to make the problem even worse."
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"Yea fr charging that much just seems so criminal. I’m a uni student in the UK, which means I can get a HC2 certificate that covers all my med costs but even when I WAS paying for it my refill was like £9.35. Damn I’m so sorry that people have to pay that much :("

Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"It's absurd.  I can't even afford to go to the dr that treats my disability because it's too expensive. I just treat with meds from my PCP. Ultimately less effective, but it's all I can do."
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"You don't have to pick it up, in person, with a new script every 30 days and let them scan your driver's license? 😲"
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,That's wild. The FDA allegedly changed their laws last July to prevent this across the country. I also live in VA and have confirmed with multiple providers (5+). I would LOVE to have this option.
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,Thanks for sharing your experience! Feeling better and better about it now. I usually set an alarm for 5:30 take my meds then sleep until 6:30 and leave for work at 7:40 so that hour and a half shouldn't be an issue!
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"Yep. My BC on it's own at Walmart was $9/month and my generic Adderall with good Rx was $20. It was $100 without goodRX, I was so shocked and happy because I was just crossing my fingers for $20 off 😂"
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"How else do you expect people to be paid so that they can buy their own food and housing?  That isn't the issue.  The issue is how obscene the overall system has becomes with respect to the bureaucracy that drives it.  Our politicians are the root cause of the issues... none of this happens without their complicit participation.  And it isn't one party's fault and the other is trying to save us.  Both of them are equally culpable.  Each of the two major parties in the US has had enough power to be able to act unilaterally on these issues at different times in the past two decades.  Evidence has shown us that neither cares.  At every opportunity they have to do something positive, their first reaction is to sneak in every other thing they want and then paint the opposition as evil when they point it out.  ""How can you possibly be against this bill?  The title is some highly dramatic thing about fixing this one dire issue!  Stop nitpicking that I put in earmarks for entirely unrelated things for my district, you evil bastard from the opposing party!"""
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,If it wasn’t profitable to sell to other countries at their asking prices then companies would just not sell to them? Why would they care about invalidating a patent in a country that’s not making them money anyway
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"You say that based on the emotion that is generated from a price that OP didn't pay.  The final price was probably not too far out of line with what you pay.  I know that my copay leaves me only paying $15 for Vyvanse.  OP said that wasn't the price paid but didn't highlight the actual price.  It is indeed a bunch of accounting trickery going on and sometime people really do get wrapped around axle by it, which is sumpremely unfortunate."
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"Not here, at least not unless Cigna's breaking the law (which I'm not completely ruling out). They'll even send me 90 days at once. 

The prescription does still need to be written and faxed in, though."
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"¯⁠\⁠_⁠(⁠ツ⁠)⁠_⁠/⁠¯ Don't know what to tell you. 

My prescription was all set to be mailed last month but I got a text saying that they couldn't fulfill it because they didn't have any in stock so I got it through Costco. 

Here's a screenshot from my insurance app urging me to ""switch back"" to home delivery through Express Scripts.

Editing to add: Re-reading my earlier comment, I see that it seems like I'm on Vyvanse. I meant only re: schedule 2 meds."
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"Because it is profitable to manufacture the drug and sell it to them at that price.  The R&D is a sunk cost, but the ongoing costs are different.  So, if it costs you $5 to make something and you sell it for $10... it is still advantageous to do that so long as it doesn't take supply away from places where you can sell it for even more.

Also, if they don't sell... they will also lose the patent.  They're protecting their intellectual property."
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,I was under the impression schedule 2 drugs like amphetamines couldn’t be mail ordered anywhere in the country as well. Weird that it’s state specific. Maryland doesn’t let you mail adderall for example
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,I used to get 3 months at a time in Georgia. In California it's now month-to-month. The rules are always changing.
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"I feel like the argument still doesn’t really add up. Even if we say they are only just breaking even by selling to these countries, doing it only for the sake of keeping the patent. How does that translate to higher costs here?

It’s not like these companies are benevolently charging less than they could then have to bring it up to offset this global subsidization. If they could charge more in the US to increase overall profits then they would just do that regardless of other countries or their associated costs and/or profit margins."
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,My daughter gets 3 months of Vyvanse at a time in California by mail.
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,"Just because you don't want to believe it doesn't make it true.  They are in fact making a profit from doing it, but they aren't getting a return on their R&D dollars from those markets.

Governments do things like this all of the time... both directions... strong-arming companies and allowing it to be done to their companies.  It is like China does with currency manipulation.  The US is allowing it because of whatever reasons the policymakers seem to be okay with it.

It is okay to have a politically motivated opinion.  What isn't okay is pretending like there is no way that there isn't a counter argument or that no things in reality exist that don't support your claims.  Political ideology is an opinion, it isn't fact.

These are facts that I am mentioning.  Go ahead, do your own research into it.  I won't try to pursuade you and cherry-pick things that support my to the exclusion of your opinion.  It is what happens.

EDIT: Your final point is absolutely true.  But that isn't happening in a vacuum.  Again, our policymakers see the reality and are in effect subsidizing the companies through policy here that makes sure they get a certain revenue to cover those costs.  If they couldn't do it, they would close up shop.  The system allows for it.  If they could get more... yep, they most certainly would... and so you would you, just as would I."
Generic Vyvanse is only 5% cheaper,Do you know what pharmacy mails them? I need to get in on this.

Vyvanse and Dexedrine Booster Questions,What ended up happening? What’s your current treatment plan?
Vyvanse and Dexedrine Booster Questions,"Currently, I (41F Dx: AuDHD, GAD, CPTSD) am on 80 mg of Vyvanse in the mornings (70mg+10mg capsules), with 5mg of Dexedrine added 1-2x / day, depending on need, as it fluctuates day to day.  
  
\*\*I am very aware of the dosing threshold,, and this dosage has been prescribed by my GP.\*\*  
  
For additional context:  
-Initially diagnosed (Dx) and medicated at age 12 (1994).   
-Off stimulant medications during childbearing/nursing years ('04-'15),   
-Intermittent medication regime 2015-2018/19 related to lack of a GP  
-Consistently medicated 2020 to present  
-Rx for separate medications to treat my GAD and CPTSD, and have observed a marked decrease in generalized anxiety/CPTSD symptoms, however, an increase in irritability at times, often tied to menstrual cycle.   
- I too have a history of health related anxiety, including chest pains at random, before and after medication Rx. It is what it is, and I keep chewable aspirin at home and in my car. This helps with the ""mind-over-matter"" anxiety relief, but there are still times I experience tachycardia or chest pain, and if I cannot bring myself down from the anxiety solo, now have 2 designated people I turn to for objective support. 

TL;DR (Oh, ADHD, how typical of you, and me) You are on a very low dose of each medication. Although you may still experience instances of a higher heart rate (as the Vyvanse is wearing off, or from the short-acting Dexedrine) I wouldn't be concerned at this low dose unless you have a substantial heart health history. 

  
Hope this helps!"

Dexedrine Spansule XR Not Being Made Anymore?,"*TL;DR: **brand name Dexedrine Spansule** from Amneal Specialty Pharmaceuticals is **available in 10mg and 15mg** but generic extended-release dextroamphetamine sulfate is on intermittent backorder across all strengths (5mg, 10mg, 15mg) with limited availability from the two generic manufacturers, Actavis and Mallinckrodt.*

*consider filling at a local / **independently-owned pharmacy or hospital pharmacy that orders from Cardinal** and have your prescriber **include the appropriate DAW code** on the Rx. 

Fortunately, YTD (really, for quite a long time now) I haven’t experienced any issues obtaining 10mg Dexedrine Spansule (brand name from Amneal Specialty). My last fill date for name brand Dexedrine was June 8.  

Whenever my (local, independently owned) pharmacy has not had sufficient on hand stock to fill my Rx on the day indicated, they’ve placed an order from their local Cardinal wholesaler and my Rx has been filled the on following business day. 

With that, yes, I have also heard that both brand name Dexedrine and generic extended-release dextroamphetamine sulfate have been having ongoing out-of-stock issues across all usual big-name pharmacy retail chains for approximately the last two months. 

I called my insurance provider (Caremark) twice this month to verify this:

Call #1 (6/2/23)
-brand (Amneal): 10mg backordered; 15mg available 
-generic (Actavis, Mallinckrodt): backordered, all strengths, no recovery date available

Call #2 (6/7/23)
-brand (Amneal): “unable to be sourced” 
-generic (Actavis, Mallinckrodt): backordered, all strengths, no recovery date available

It was obviously bizarre / alarming hearing that brand Dexedrine, available in 15mg the previous week at Caremark Mail Service pharmacy, was suddenly “unable to be sourced.” 

I then called Amneal to verify Caremark’s claim and confirm availability.

Contrary to what Caremark had claimed, I was informed by the Amneal customer care representative that yes, both the 10mg and 15mg strengths are active and readily available.  

She further remarked, verbatim, “if the Caremark Mail Service pharmacy wishes to stock any Dexedrine, then they can either send us, or their wholesaler, a purchase order for it.” 

Moral: brand Dexedrine from local / independently-owned pharmacies or a local hospital pharmacy, using a local Cardinal wholesaler for any C2 drug orders may be the path of least resistance to fill your Dexedrine. 

DAW Codes and the cost of Brand Dexedrine / Pro-Tip: 
Brand name Dexedrine Spansule might be extraordinarily expensive (insurance depending),

With generics unavailable due to backorder, you may consider speaking with your insurer, pharmacist, and physician to ensure you can continue paying the generic cost of your prescription while brand name is dispensed through your prescriber indicating a DAW code on your prescription before sending it to your pharmacy of choice (most likely DAW 4, 8, or 1).  

DAW-4: Substitution allowed - generic not in stock;
DAW-8: Substitution allowed - generic drug not available in marketplace; 
DAW-1: Substitution not allowed by prescriber.

Dexedrine Spansule XR Not Being Made Anymore?,"I would like to know too.  I was last able to get mine filled in April, using supplies the pharmacy had gotten in March, resulting in a partial fill.  They have not been able to get any in since then, so I had to switch to Vyvanse."
Dexedrine Spansule XR Not Being Made Anymore?,"Same issue, I have not been able to get it filled since April.  I went a month without anything and then my Dr switched me to Vyvanse which is not lasting but 4 hours in the morning for me.  I have been searching the internet looking for more info.   I know the manufacturer of my RX is TEVA and they are focusing on name brand name production only (they do not own the name brand Dexedrine) .  

When I look it up on the pricing function for United Healthcare Commercial it doesn't  show any pharmacies in my area with a price for it.

I really want to switch back, I am studying for the CPA exam, I have never needed it more."
Dexedrine Spansule XR Not Being Made Anymore?,Just started new prescription yesterday
Dexedrine Spansule XR Not Being Made Anymore?," have not been talking Dexedrine Spansule brand name- it’s not covered by my insurance. I’ve been on generic dextroamphetamine sulfate ER and had good results with it. I just checked the FDA shortage list today, 7/6/23, and unfortunately the generic ER is listed as “discontinuation”. Immediately heard the sad Charlie Brown music in my head. It says the IR is “currently in shortage” though, and my doc agreed to prescribe a second short-acting dose to boost my 50mg of Vyvanse that continues to do almost nothing. Thank you for your guidance on how to verify which pharmacies have meds in stock. Your solidarity makes this very unappealing summer project more bearable! ✊🏼
https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/drugshortages/dsp_SearchResults.cfm"
Dexedrine Spansule XR Not Being Made Anymore?,"I am still not able to source as well.  My small independent pharmacy says it is back ordered but no date given as to when it will be back in stock.  My insurance will not cover brand name even with shortage. Out of pocket one month supply for me is over $1,000

 They are covering brand name Adderall if generic is not available.   But Adderall doesn't work well for me.  

I'm just so discouraged.   I haven't had Dexedrine since March and I feel like a shell of my former self.  It's like trying to walk around when u are near sighted but don't have your glasses.  U manage okay but miss a lot things all around you <sigh>"
Dexedrine Spansule XR Not Being Made Anymore?,"Thank you so much for this. I can’t believe the amount of work you’ve had to put into hunting Spansule down. I’m stuck with Vyvanse for the time being, but when this supply runs low I’ll try calling the locals."
Dexedrine Spansule XR Not Being Made Anymore?,"I have only been going to a local small independent pharmacy.  The first one I went to for 23 years has basically told me they will no longer fill my Dexedrine XR because they are ""unable to provide it,""   but that pharmacy, as it turns out, has some issues with business practices and is under investigation, so thinking they have restrictions.  I switched to another local pharmacy at the recommendation of my Dr.  but have not tried to get generic Dexedrine XR yet.  My Doctor also believes that generics are going away and that I should try other drugs since I have been taking Dexedrine before Adderall was even on the market.  

The information you provided above gives me hope! Thank you so much!  I teared up in relief when I read it just now. 

I have not felt like myself since I had to go off Dexedrine ER back in May.   Next month when I am able to get another month filled, I am hopeful that I will be able to convince my Dr. to let my pharmacy see if they can source it."
Dexedrine Spansule XR Not Being Made Anymore?,"I keep reading that nothing is being produced under the brand name Dexedrine, but your comment says it's available?"
Dexedrine Spansule XR Not Being Made Anymore?,"Wow this is impressive! Currently in hell switching meds, new to generic zenzedi (dextroamp. sulphate). Adderall made my heart go bat-shit crazy, dex sulfate fixed that effect but burns off too quickly. My doctor suggested Dexedrine spansules, but when I looked up the generics it looks like the same generics used for adderall xr & mydayis- am I way off? It’s really confusing. To ask another way, is dexedrine spansules more like an adderall feeling or more like dexedrine sulphate with an extended release? TYIA!"
Dexedrine Spansule XR Not Being Made Anymore?,"Oh, wow- big waves of solidarity heading your way! I can’t imagine trying to study for an exam while feeling like this. I used to take Vyvanse and it was fine. Dr switched me back to it, and I’m having the same reaction you described…I get barely anything. It’s so frustrating. And it takes SO LONG to kick in compared to Spansule. Thank you for taking the time to write back with what you know. Good luck with your exam!!! 🤞🏻🤞🏻"
Dexedrine Spansule XR Not Being Made Anymore?,"I know it’s been a 2 weeks since you made this post, but just to clarify this, the “discontinuation” to which you refer concerning Dextroamphetamine Sulfate Extended-Release Capsules was specific *only to one generic manufacturer*, Mylan Pharmaceuticals, and was effective on May 8, 2018. 

Mylan Pharmaceuticals actively manufactured generic Dextroamphetamine Sulfate Extended-Release Capsules (brown/white with “MYLAN DA XX”, with XX representing the strength in milligrams printed on both capsule halves) in the 5mg, 10mg, and 15mg strengths from August 1, 2016 through May 8, 2018. 

Teva’s Actavis and Mallinckrodt’s SpecGx, LLC both continue to manufacture generic dextroamphetamine sulfate extended release capsules, albeit both remain currently on intermittent backorder. 

Shortly after discontinuing their generic dextroamphetamine sulfate extended release capsules, Mylan Pharmaceuticals became ensnared in a legal issue with the US government concerning their generic EpiPen product’s increasing price point and accuracy around its drug classification, for which the company later settled after having merged with Pfizer’s Upjohn division and rebranded Viatris Pharmaceuticals."
Dexedrine Spansule XR Not Being Made Anymore?,"I’m so sorry to hear this! I can’t take Adderall, either. It does nothing but make me feel angry. 🤷🏻‍♀️ My doctor added a generic IR dextroamphetamine to my daily Vyvanse last month, and it’s helping my mind stay focused much more than Vyvanse alone. It’s not Spansule, but it’s the closest I’ve felt to “normal” in a long time. Just wanted to share, for what it’s worth. I hope something falls into place for you soon!!"
Dexedrine Spansule XR Not Being Made Anymore?,"Can you link to the sources that you’re reading? That would be quite surprising to me, and fly in the face of everything I was told since my last Rx. 

I last filled my brand name Dexedrine Spansule on June 8 from my local pharmacy, just as I’ve done every month for years. Happy to take a photo of the bottle with the NDC to provide proof. 

Earlier in the month I called and verified with Amneal Specialty Pharmaceuticals of NY, LLC, who hold the patent to name brand Dexedrine Spansule, that it continues to be available and is in active production. They confirmed on both counts. 

This aligns with the “Active” NDC / Status detail for Dexedrine Spansule in both 10mg and 15mg given by Amneal’s website. See link below.

Dexedrine Spansule XR Not Being Made Anymore?,"Thank you,  still have not been able to source Dexedrine Spansules; last month tried Vyvance (which barely gave me 3 hours of focus per day).  Tried Adderal instant release today. Hardcore side effects  - diarrhea, nausea, and fatigue with every dose (took three today).   I was too tired to study.  I combed the internet looking for anything on Generic Dexedrine XR and if it was being discontinued and cant find a thing.  I think I have exhausted all other stimulants.  I so miss how Dexedrine just smoothly got me in focus, and when it wore off, it was calm and smooth.  I never felt amped up or tired on it.  Just focused.

Dexedrine Spansule XR Not Being Made Anymore?,"I totally need my Dexedrine back and here is the proof.  I saw it on Wikipedia in the history section, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextroamphetamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextroamphetamine), and on [Drugs.com](https://Drugs.com), but I didn't pay attention that both sites say that IR Dexedrine is no longer sold under the brand name Dexedrine.  Zenzedi is the ""brand"" name now.   It's just the Spansules that are still produced under the brand name Dexedrine.  My apologies for not double-checking before I posted such a blanket statement.   

Very grateful there are still brand name Dexedrine Spanuales being produced.  This has been a journey for me. When I was diagnosed with ADHD, the only two drugs on the market to treat ADHD was Ritalin and Dexedrine. Wellbutrin was brand spanking new and only in IR form - ADHD use was off-label.  It is good I am trying other options to be sure Dexedrine is best for me.   It is.  I just hope my Dr. thinks so too so I don't have to do a 3rd month of trying something else.   

I want to read a Wikipedia one time and comprehend it all, not several times and still miss things  <sigh>

&#x200B;

Thanks again for all your information and research on Dexedrine.  It is very helpful."
Dexedrine Spansule XR Not Being Made Anymore?,"No worries! 🙂 

Glad to be able to help you. 

For what it’s worth, I would imagine that given the ongoing Adderall shortage, name brand Dexedrine Spansule and name brand Zenzedi would have both experienced a notable uptick in demand, and that some of those Adderall-prescribed patients who tried either/both recently might find one or both preferable, and decide to make their temporary “shortage switch” a permanent one (with either name brand Dexedrine / Zenzedi or the generics). 

If that’s indeed the case, it would seem totally illogical to me for any of the manufacturers to pull anything from the market. Consider also (and I’m speculating now) that one active ingredient (vs. four) is likely more economical, if maybe even faster, to produce in either release type. 

Despite the changing landscape of pharmaceutical companies and patent holders, dextroamphetamine sulfate has prevailed, having been available and marketed in the US for nearly 80 years; the Spansule, nearly 70. Without question, its longevity has been sustained by its profitability — which, in turn, has been sustained by its efficacy."
Dexedrine Spansule XR Not Being Made Anymore?,"I didn't think about the longevity of Dexedrine on the market, and I agree it's points in it's favor.  But this shortage I think will actually cause options to decrease as commercial insurance/PBMs make deals with manufacturers for name brand rebates and start removing lesser used options in their formularies.  

I have UHC Commercial since 2018 and since then I only been given Teva's generic Dexedrine spansules.   UHC added Name brand Adderall coverage starting this Feb and in June the new formulary now shows Dexedrine Spansules as a policy exclusion (at least the 15mg) and the name brand already was a policy exclusion. Teva does not own the brand name of any just Dexedrine products, but they do own the Adderall brand name.  As Teva said in their Q1 earnings call, they are focusing on brand name production.  So based on Teva's announcement and UHCs formulary changes, I see some potential strategic moves on both their parts to get more people on Adderall.    So while it may be around for now, it may be manipulated into obscurity.    

I am not sure how the supply chain works but my gut says I am not that far off.   Def gonna ask my Dr to pit me back on Dexedrine next month and see if I can get it.  Praying I am wrong about all of it. 

Thanks again for all the info.  You have really helped a lot.    I'm gonna fight to get Dexedeine as long as I can.  Health insurance companies don't really care about health, only profit."

Anyone on Dexedrine being hit by shortage?,"I’ve been on Dexedrine since the 4th grade. I’m 32. Was just told I could only get 20 days worth of my prescription today and they wouldn’t have more for probably a month. I took that but I’m a little scared. 

I’ll probably space it out—take 10 mg a day instead of my usual 20– I hope I don’t have any withdrawal symptoms. But I’m really hoping my work isn’t impacted too much, because I know it will to some extent"

Anyone on Dexedrine being hit by shortage?,"I take instant release Adderall and I haven’t had a problem getting it through the shortage, and December my refill was half Teva and have something else, then in January I got the XR but I didn’t like it so I went back to the IR.

My doctor told me that when he sends the prescription to the pharmacy they will contact him and let him know if they don’t have it so when I switched I told him I could wait for a bit but if they they think it’s hopeless please send something else.
The pharmacy doesn’t communicate with the doctor?"
Anyone on Dexedrine being hit by shortage?,Yes been a month still no fill
Anyone on Dexedrine being hit by shortage?,Did you ever get your meds? Are you on IR or ER? I’m having a hard time getting dextroamphetamine IR 10mg 3x daily.  I call the local pharmacies and they tell me that is generic adderall?! I thought it was generic Dexedrine.
Anyone on Dexedrine being hit by shortage?,"I used to be on dexedrine(only switched because it went up in price), and dexedrine is my plan b medication of choice if I can't get my adderall. the physician assistant I see has made note of that.

Anyone on Dexedrine being hit by shortage?,"I cannot fill my dex script. They’re out of ALL strengths. So I’m back on adderall and boy is it nasty. Jittery, irritable (I find myself snapping at people for no reason), it’s just not at all smooth like dex. I ran out of my back stash after 3 months and have been forced to take adderall. I’ve called every pharmacy and nothing. My doctor has been more than helpful and willing to change the script to anything that’s available but  nothing has been. All of the pharmacies around know me by name now because I call every few days. OP they will tell you if it’s in stock if you tell them you have a prescription. Why else would you be calling and asking about it? Can’t buy it without a script.."
Anyone on Dexedrine being hit by shortage?,Just got told by my pharmacist they can’t get Dexedrine
Anyone on Dexedrine being hit by shortage?,Damn I hate to hear that ☹️ hopefully they get it back in stock for you soon.
Anyone on Dexedrine being hit by shortage?,"Well technically I got switched *to* Adderall, because the dextro was unattainable lol, but I see where you’re coming from. My pharmacist just kept confusing it with generic Adderall and when I would correct him I would get “oh yeah, we haven’t had those in months!” 

I have not had problems filling the Adderall yet since being switched, but I figure it’ll happen eventually 🫤"
Anyone on Dexedrine being hit by shortage?,Yup. And it’s causing the shortage to bleed over to our meds
Anyone on Dexedrine being hit by shortage?,"Yeah, idk. I did ask the pharmacist if they could communicate directly with my doctor to go over what options they had in stock, so I did not have to go back and forth. He said “unfortunately not for this type of medication” which I assume to mean controlled substances? Idk.. he said I would have to get in touch with her myself to figure out what option would be best and then she would have to send over a new script, or I could try a different pharmacy. He went over a few different options with me ie; switching to Adderall, filling with another mg and just taking half, etc., he told me what all they had in stock, and even checked other branches in the area to see if they had it 🤷🏻‍♀️

But yeah, idk, I thought they could just get in touch with my doctor also, e. But yeah, idk- he said they couldn’t request a prescription change, and that I had to. He *also* had told me he was going to fill it for me after he discovered the script someone hadn’t picked up…only to call me back like 10 minutes later because he *thought* my prescription was for generic Adderall, but it was *actually* for the Dexedrine 🤷🏻‍♀️"
Anyone on Dexedrine being hit by shortage?,"Yeah I ended up seeing my doctor today and she  just switched me to Adderall. My pharmacy at least has had different mg’s coming in and out of that periodically, and it’s a lot easier to get my script written for portioning a different mg as needed then to get a whole new script. 

My pharmacy said they hadn’t been able to get the Dexedrine in ANY dosage in months, and they were “not optimistic” 🫤 I talked to them before my apt and found out exactly what they had in stock in the Adderall and was able to just get that filled after my doctor approved it. 

Hope yours gets filled soon, or you’re able to switch to something that will 🫤"
Anyone on Dexedrine being hit by shortage?,"It is. Pharmacists just get confused if you aren’t super specific about it, because it is the same as generic Adderall, but the Adderall has an extra ingredient so it’s like “dextroamphetemine- __________” can’t remember the full name, but a lot of people just shorten the name when talking about Adderall. Even my pharmacist got confused at first telling me they “had it in stock” and then called me back saying “oops sorry we have generic Adderall, didn’t realize it was the dexedrine” 

No I never got the dexedrine filled 🙁 but my doctor switched me to Adderall and I was able to fill that at my pharmacy."
Anyone on Dexedrine being hit by shortage?,"Ohh, see the Dexedrine is only $10 with my insurance. Before my insurance authorization kicked in I had a coupon that made it $28 for 60. Are you in the US? I wonder if I can talk to my doctor about a “plan B” medication? Does your doctor still have to write a separate script for that when they are out or the Adderall and your pharmacy just knows to hold it for you/let you know, or do they just like automatically switch it out if they’re out of the first one?"
Anyone on Dexedrine being hit by shortage?,"Idk k got switched to Adderall and haven’t had too many problems getting it. A few here and there, but they usually have something in stock and they can alter my script a bit"
Anyone on Dexedrine being hit by shortage?,"Thanks. That sucks about your prescription… As far as I know, my pharmacy still hasn’t gotten it back either. Luckily, I haven’t had any trouble with my Adderall (yet) but then when they filled my script last week the pharmacist told me it was the last of what they had and they were back on back order 😞 sooo I’m really hoping that doesn’t go out of stock too. 

I am glad that you mentioned some thing about being jittery and snapping. Up until recently in past points of my life I had only ever been prescribed Adderall— then my doctor put me on the dex before the whole stock issue went down… Now I am back on Adderall and it’s fine.. works ok, but I have definitely noticed with this last script that I too feel very jittery and find myself getting easily irritated after taking them consistently. 

Honestly, I had not been on the dex long enough to know whether or not I had any similar issues… But I was considering talking to my doctor at my next appointment about trying something different. I’ve been on and off meds since I was like 16-17 (so about 15+ years) and Adderall is basically the only one I’ve ever been on. It’s always helped… but I always end up stopping after a while because of the other side effects. 

After being in this sub I’ve seen a lot of people talk about Ritalin or vyvance working when Adderall doesn’t for people.. idk.. never tried either of those, but I am thinking about discussing a switch with my doctor. Also feel like less likely to be hit with shortages. I know vyvance is pretty expensive tho"
Anyone on Dexedrine being hit by shortage?,Did he say why?  My pharmacist today said its on backorder and he will have to check daily for it.
Anyone on Dexedrine being hit by shortage?,"I am in the US and I'm pretty sure it would require a separate script.  I was on dexedrine for at least 20 years before I switched to adderall. it's a controlled substance, too. fortunately I have not had any issues getting my adderall so I have not had to fall back on my backup. at the time when I switched to adderall it was $90 for a one month supply after insurance when it used to be much cheaper."

I've been having trouble with the LA ritalin and I take vitamin c twice daily, sometimes the first one is with or directly after the ritalin. My symptoms point to too high a dose based on what I've found. You'd think my psych would mention this. Here I am reading peoples experiences between MPH and dex because I'm swapping to try soon"

Every day I feel stimulants kick in, I’m glued to my chair but get little done, and I’m a vague zombie. By the end of the day I’m just an exhausted zombie.
When I’m not on stimulants I’m quite funny and social but on them, robotic and cranky.

Im hoping this stuff works differently .. I have hypertension anyway so lowering my bp is an added bonus"

Dexamphetamine (Dexedrine) vs Guanfacine (Intuniv),"Worth a try I think. Guanfacine  Very commonly makes blood pressure low, so if it’s already on the low end that might be not great. Didn’t work for me and made my blood pressure too low, but it was already lowish to start. But I do know many who it worked for"

Dexedrine crash,Did you ever find any solutions?
Generic dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) manufacturers in US – which pharmacies?,I received Zenzedi (authorized generic) for 15mg and 20mg IR tablets. I hated it. The onset is fast and the duration is really short. Really pointless for me to use as I need prefer a shorter onset with longer duration. So I switched back to Teva 10mg (CVS Pharmacy.)
Generic dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) manufacturers in US – which pharmacies?,"I’ve taken Zenzedi 10mg, Teva 10mg, Mallinckrodt 10mg, and Aurobindo 10mg…

Simply put:

Zenzedi > Mallinckrodt > Teva > Aurobindo

My experiences:

Zenzedi is the strongest, with a steady consistent duration, and the least side effects of any (cleanest).

Mallinckrodt is not as strong as Zenzedi, but it is more consistent than Teva and Aurobindo. The duration feels shorter than Zenzedi, but I think it comes on faster.

Teva is inconsistent, it can be strong or weak. Duration seems comparable to Mallinckrodt, but again not as much consistency.

Aurobindo is weak in general but still inconsistent nonetheless. It’s also inconsistent in duration, and tends to create more side effects (jitteriness, heartbeat, etc). It should be avoided if possible.

——

I haven’t been able to find a pharmacy for over a year now to get Zenzedi. CVS doesn’t. Caremark used to. Costco doesn’t. Fry’s doesn’t. I’m paying out of pocket, so if the pharmacy doesn’t have a competitive GoodRx coupon, then I haven’t tried them."

Generic dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) manufacturers in US – which pharmacies?,"Do not take the Aurobindo! I was sick for over a year, went to tons of specialists and it turned out it was the Aurobindo generic  Dextroamphetamine  pills. They did little to help my ADHD, I was getting migraines, hives, horrible anxiety, blood pressure fluctuations, at a new point 4 doctors had me on a total of 8 meds to combat my mystery Illness which turned out to be some poisonous filler Aurobindo uses. It's not just the Dex pulls, I took another generic Aurobindo med last week and the same thing happened. I did discover that if you let the Aurobindo Dex totally dissolve in water, shack it up, let the crap fall to the bottom. The Dextroamphetamine will dissolve into the water. syphon off the clear water, and drink that and I had no side effects.

Read on the ADHD forums, tons of people are having the same experience. I documented my experience and submitted it to the FDA."

He was the world's leading authority on ADHD treatment before his death. His talked about how important it was to have very consistent levels of the stimulant in your system during the day.

MALLIINKRODT is decent"
Generic dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) manufacturers in US – which pharmacies?,"I get wilshire every month. I definitely had to do some work to find the right pharmacy. Walgreens and CVS and other chains won’t stock it and don’t care. But it’s definitely out there. There’s a link to find a pharmacy near you that likely will fill Wilshire if you ask. I did have to have my psychiatrist specify Wilshire each script.

And aurobindo was also the manufacturer I first for when I tried dextro for the first month. I think that’s just the go to for every pharmacy, probs sucks because it’s probs cheap and that’s why everywhere stocks it lol. 

I didn’t HATE IT at first, but I definitely felt weird from it too. I was determined to find Wilshire after learning that it was the only authorized generic of Zen.  If I went back to aurobindo after now taking Wilshire I know it was absolutely suck. 

Are you in the US? What city/state?"
Generic dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) manufacturers in US – which pharmacies?,"Did you specifically request or get prescribed that one (Wilshire), or was it the only one available at the time?"
Generic dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) manufacturers in US – which pharmacies?,"Awesome, thanks!"
Generic dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) manufacturers in US – which pharmacies?,"It sounds like you might have been experiencing some allergic reaction to the generic as well. I had a relative who was started on Adderall by NorthStar (Aurobindo-affiliated), and it was giving them a bunch of weird digestive side effects that looked a whole lot like lactose intolerance. I’ve seen the theory that Aurobindo’s Adderall ratio is L-amp-heavy, but their version of what’s supposed to be pure D-amp triggering the same peripheral nervous system side effects (and/or allergies or intolerances) makes it seem more like cross-contamination or something weird with their lab synthesis.  

Your technique to titrate/dissolve it is fascinating. I know that the guides for capsules like Vyvanse specifically say that the powder inside can be mixed into food or drink, but I didn’t think that a tablet could work the same way. I will give this a shot, thanks so much for the suggestion."
Generic dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) manufacturers in US – which pharmacies?,When you say shack it up do you mean shake it up?  I was recently prescribed Dexedrine and I was given the Aurobindo brand.  I’m being cautious and gradually raising my dose but I don’t notice any improvement in focus yet.
Generic dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) manufacturers in US – which pharmacies?,"I’m trying to think what DD means in context here and I’m coming up blank! A medication, or a way of taking it...?"
Generic dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) manufacturers in US – which pharmacies?,Same here. I’m starting to think Aurobindo is so common because it’s the cheapest.
Generic dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) manufacturers in US – which pharmacies?,"I haven't seen as many complaints about Mallinckrodt, but it's so individual. The binders used to make different IR tablets vary; I know I've had noticeably different reactions to 5mg vs half of a 10mg that ostensibly were made by the **same** manufacturer. Great to hear that you've found a routine that works!"
Generic dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) manufacturers in US – which pharmacies?,How were they?
Generic dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) manufacturers in US – which pharmacies?,"I did not request it. Zenzedi is the only available as of right now--at least in the 15mg and 20mg dosages. My pill bottles list Arbor as the manufacture. The pills are identical to name brand but at the price of a generic (with my insurance anyway)

My pharmacist told me there are no other IR dextroamphetamine sulphate generics available in the 15mg and 20mg dosages. However, I haven't had an issue getting a non-Arbor generic (Teva) in the 10mg dose."
Generic dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) manufacturers in US – which pharmacies?,still waiting on my insurance womp womp
Generic dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) manufacturers in US – which pharmacies?,"Yes, that's what they meant. I've actually had really good success with their suggestion – thinking about making a new post about it for visibility. 

If Dexedrine isn't helping your cognition at all, it just may not be the right medication for you. But if Aurobindo tablets (or any IR tablets, really) are giving you side effects, dissolving the meds in water and then straining it through a coffee filter seems to help a lot."
Generic dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) manufacturers in US – which pharmacies?,Due Diligence
Generic dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) manufacturers in US – which pharmacies?,"It could be, I agree  Which actually seems counterproductive."
Generic dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) manufacturers in US – which pharmacies?,"They seemed to work just fine for me! They did feel a bit ""speedier"" than my XRs and the Aurobindo and Sunrise generics I've tried."
Generic dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) manufacturers in US – which pharmacies?,"That lines up since Wilshire = Arbor. So to make sure I’m hearing right: CVS was giving you Teva, and your doctor prescribed the Zenzedi-specific dosage which you’ve now given up on due to Arbor."
Generic dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) manufacturers in US – which pharmacies?,"Aw yep, I know how that goes…"
Generic dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) manufacturers in US – which pharmacies?,"I tried that since my last comment because I just assumed they meant shaken up.  I get different effects every time.  It kicks in at a different time every time.  Sometimes it seemed to help, other times it made my adhd worse.  Another time it made me sleepy."
Generic dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) manufacturers in US – which pharmacies?,Right!
Generic dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) manufacturers in US – which pharmacies?,"Two questions: are you leaving most of the dissolved tablet behind? And were you experiencing side effects to begin with, or are you just worried about developing them?"
Generic dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) manufacturers in US – which pharmacies?,"Yes to question 1, and yes I had side effects when I swallowed them whole.  Bad anxiety when wearing off mostly and some during.  No side effects without the binders, just different effects every time.  I’m really disappointed."
Generic dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) manufacturers in US – which pharmacies?,"Yeah, so sounds like you’re stuck between side effects or unreliability with the Aurobindo. For myself, I really prefer ER capsules to IR tablets. It’s the most mental clarity with the fewest physical effects. I don’t know if your doctor would prescribe Dexedrine ER / Vyvanse, but that would be my suggestion to try next. (And if one of those still isn’t doing it for you, you can rule out pure dexamphetamine entirely and move on to a different class of med)"
Generic dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) manufacturers in US – which pharmacies?,"I don’t want ER capsules because there are some days I don’t want to be medicated for 12 hours, I like the flexibility or IR.  I was gonna ask her to let me give Zenzedi tablets a try at my next appointment in a few days.  Brand name and Teva adderall worked really good for me back when I was using adderall.  Brand name was best.  Actavis adderall was the other one I tried, I didn’t like it.  It gave me side effects.  I have read reports about Aurobindo being sanctioned for cross contamination and shit like that.  Maybe it was a different substance every time or something.  My boyfriend is adhd too.  He told me he had issues with Aurobindo too.  Said he’d need to take more than when he took brand name, and sometimes it made his adhd worse instead of better."
Generic dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) manufacturers in US – which pharmacies?,"Ok, so you already know Adderall works for you. Def a manufacturer issue then. I’d be interested to hear your experience with Zenzedi/Wilshire if you get those!"
Generic dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) manufacturers in US – which pharmacies?,"Yeah I do, but my psych said she tries that medication last because it’s hardest on the heart.  I’m really wanting to see if Zenzedi will work for me if I can get it, I’ll try to get teva if I can’t get it.  She’s going over my genesight test results on my next appt as well.  Last appointment was my first with her."
Generic dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) manufacturers in US – which pharmacies?,"Right, I meant that your problem now is trying to find the right manufacturer rather than the right med. I know it’s possible to write an Rx for specific manufacturers (Wilshire, Teva), but I haven’t asked my doctor for that because I didn’t want to get stuck with the pharmacy telling me they can’t fill it. Hence this post, haha. Hopefully she’ll have some suggestions based on your test results :)"
Generic dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) manufacturers in US – which pharmacies?,"Luckily my insurance will cover Zenzedi, I just switched to a privately owned pharmacy hoping I’ll have better luck trying to get hard to find meds like Zenzedi.  I wanna try that so bad now.  I can’t believe pharmacies stock garbage like Aurobindo."

Doc switched me to Dexedrine in light of shortage,"If your Dex brand/generic you get is quality, it will feel mentally more potent than Adderall, with slightly less physical kick. If you can get used to less kick and reframe your expectations, dex is truly a cleaner, better medicine in my opinion. My resting heart rate on dex vs Adderall is night and day difference.
I was able to switch from Adderall 15mgs IR 2xday to Dextroamphetamine 15mgs 2xday with ease. Honestly the Dextroamphetamine in equal doses was almost a little too much at first."
Doc switched me to Dexedrine in light of shortage,"as someone who switched from adderall to dexedrine, things seem relatively consistent between the two of them performance-wise, and i feel less of the side effects adderall used to give me (which is why i stopped taking it). 

in terms of shortage-- i didn't have any issues getting dexedrine before the refill i got a few days ago, and even then i just had to have my doc send the script a second time to a different CVS 10 minutes away, rather than the situation with adderall where people are saying no pharmacies within a 50-mile radius have it and they won't be getting any more soon
so, yeah, there is a shortage but its not nearly as bad at least in my area (boston suburbs)"
Doc switched me to Dexedrine in light of shortage,"Ooh, I’m following for the answer as well."
Doc switched me to Dexedrine in light of shortage,"I know stimulants kind of seem to affect everyone differently. I switched from 20 mg IR Adderall 3X per day to the Dexedrine recently. While my focus was ok, I didn't seem to have the motivation to do tasks that I usually do. My mood actually seemed to take a hit. I did another switch to another drug called Dyanavel and it is working well. It's actually a longer duration than Vyvanse. It has cost savings cards so my first month is $0. I have read reviews that some have a great experience on Dexedrine and prefer it!"
Doc switched me to Dexedrine in light of shortage,I am also being switched to Dexedrine but worried that it will also be hard to get due to the shortage honestly. I live in a rural area so I have limited pharmacies available to me and the closest one to me is a small town pharmacy that doesn't get a huge variety of drugs. I'm hoping I can get it at the Walmart pharmacy in the next town over.
Doc switched me to Dexedrine in light of shortage,"I finally got to my best therapeutic dose of Adderal XR at 30 mg before the shortage took it away. Only got one good month at that dose. My psychiatrist sent the Dexadrine (spansule) 15 mg in and My insurance covered generic brand pretty close to the same price. 

At first it felt like it was doing nothing. But after a few days I realized it was actually working, it was just way more subtle. 

Most likely because of the lack of amphetamine. Best way I can describe it is that It doesn’t “kick in” like Adderal,  it sorta sneaks in when your not looking. 

Also noticed that the come down isn’t as harsh. 
I always get very loud  ear ringing as the meds wear off and sometimes anxiety.  With the Dex the ear ringing slowly comes in and no anxiety at all. 

All my Stanton’s are covered as well as before when on Adderall. Focus, cognitive function etc. 

 I actually liked the kicking in of Adderall. It was like a morning coffee. But definitely prefer the come down of Dex so it’s a dead even for me. If I can get bumped to 20mg I think it would win the race"
Doc switched me to Dexedrine in light of shortage,"I prefer dexedrine, I won’t take Adderall"
Doc switched me to Dexedrine in light of shortage,That explains why my medication I’ve been on for 10+ years is all of the sudden out of Stock everywhere. I’m rooting for you guys as well as being like wtf
Doc switched me to Dexedrine in light of shortage,"So I take dexadrine sr now too in light of the shortage. It is less effective for me than adderall but when I first started it made me feel sharp. I just got stuck with out It for 2 days ( traveling home from punta cana and the flight got canceled) the come down off of 45 mg of dexadrine sr was super mild compared to when I was on 40 mg of adderal xr. But. That said it made me realize it doesn't do a lot to help me. I take it to treat adhd and narcolepsy It doesn't help a lot with the narcolepsy either.. enough so I can make through. I also find if it take vitamin c it's a placebo. If I don't take zinc with it it is less effective..

I don't hate it. I don't have side effects. Ritilan worked but made me feel like a zombie. And sleepy too.

I am thinking of asking about foclin xr at my apt next week. However the dexadrine worked well for a while. Then it lost effectiveness which never happened with adderall for me."
Doc switched me to Dexedrine in light of shortage,Thanks for your reply. That’s my exact concern about the manufacturers…. Bc I have that problem with adderall and only take Sandoz. What’s the preferred brand of dex generic that’s good? I’m waiting for pre auth from my ins right now so I don’t even know if my cvs has them in stock. Do you know if they’re backordered? I just asked my doc if he could send brand name and I’ll eat the cost. My adderall tolerance is super high and 60 mg keeps me awake but doesn’t make me cracked out. Trying to understand how it is with dex. Do you get energy?
Doc switched me to Dexedrine in light of shortage,"Ah okay thanks. I’m in NYC so maybe it’s the same since we’re relatively close. The script says dextroamphetamine-sulfate ER 15 mg and I’m just waiting on insurance auth for it. But do you know if that is generic? I’m assuming so. What does yours say and also who is the manufacturer? I’m worried about having an issue with the generic manufacturers like there are with adderall. For some reason my CVS app is already showing the NDC code even though I’m still pending ins approval, but I looked up the code and it says Actavis"
Doc switched me to Dexedrine in light of shortage,We’re you switched to Dexedrine? I’m worried tbh have seen mixed reviews and think they have the same generic differences issue
Doc switched me to Dexedrine in light of shortage,Ah yeah I’m coming from the same dose of adderall. And I really think that’s gonna be my situation too. I hate to have preconceived notions about it but I just having a feeling I’m gonna have a similar experience. Especially because lack of motivation is honestly my most pronounced symptom of my adhd and I need that push to be able to function day to day. I feel like the dex might cause me to get off track and focus on the wrong things and fall down rabbit holes. I’m really kinda anxious about the whole thing. I haven’t gotten them yet tho waiting for my insurance to approve them
Doc switched me to Dexedrine in light of shortage,I wasn’t able to get mine and my insurance denied it anyways. They said Dexedrine is even more scarce than adderall
Doc switched me to Dexedrine in light of shortage,"mine just says Dextroamphetamine 10 mg tab, so id guess the difference there is that you're taking extended release capsules? as for manufacturer- it says teva USA. last month i had a different manufacturer, which was mallinkrodt pharmaceuticals. if i had to choose, i feel like the teva ones have been better overall."

Lamotrigine and Dexedrine dose increase- hair loss,"If I remember correctly I belive Vyvanse is in the Dex family? If so, yes I have been getting hair loss too. I am on Elvanse and my hair as been thinning since the day I took it."
Lamotrigine and Dexedrine dose increase- hair loss,:( any update - I’m taking Lamotrigine ER 100mg and Dexedrine ER 20mg in the morning/10afternoon. Meds are working but I feel like I’m shedding like crazy. Has your hair recovered are you still taking it?
Lamotrigine and Dexedrine dose increase- hair loss,How long have you been on Elvanse?
Lamotrigine and Dexedrine dose increase- hair loss,1 Month on the medication in total. I stopped for a week and within 48 hours noticed less her was coming out when I ran my fingers through. Looking to switch to Concerta as most hair loss stories ive read are from those on amphetamine based medications.
Lamotrigine and Dexedrine dose increase- hair loss,"Come to think of it, I didn’t take it over the weekend and I noticed less hair loss. I’m thinking I will likely have to switch too. So tough finally starting to feel “ normal “ and now I’m pretty much going bald. Can’t win"
Lamotrigine and Dexedrine dose increase- hair loss,"Same with me! Elvanse has been really helpful and I think with a slight change to dose etc it could be great. However, I dont want to lose my bloody hair!"
Lamotrigine and Dexedrine dose increase- hair loss,"Same, my hair was super thick and it’s long. This is my second time going through excessive hair shedding. I seen a dermatologist in April and was told it’s not my meds it was from having COVID, in November. Fast forward to a dose increase it’s definitely the meds. I have tried adderall, vyvanse, foquest, and I think focalin. All unpleasant reactions, chest pain, aggression, etc. Dex seems to be the only one so far that is working but now hair loss. I am so frustrated"
Lamotrigine and Dexedrine dose increase- hair loss,I have also had Covid and saw no hair loss issues at all so I am confident its the meds. Have you tried a methylphenidate medication?

Thoughts on this study comparing Vyvanse to Dexedrine?,"Guessing it’s equivalent amphetamine dose over the same absorption period?

My Vyvanse only has effectiveness for 5-6 hours but I get a very consistently better day in comparison to just Dex."
Thoughts on this study comparing Vyvanse to Dexedrine?,[deleted]
Thoughts on this study comparing Vyvanse to Dexedrine?,"That study and many others prove the point, Vyvanse isn’t an extended release medication. It really is nothing more than a delayed release short acting form of dextroamphetamine. 
It reaches its peak around 4 hours (per the prescription info under the pharmacokinetics section). 
The 13 hour duration they market it as is because they are relying on the half-life of amphetamine."
Thoughts on this study comparing Vyvanse to Dexedrine?,How long would you say Dex is effective for you in comparison?
Thoughts on this study comparing Vyvanse to Dexedrine?,"Yeah vyvanse is far from a silver bullet for me, but when I don't take it it's very apparent how non-functional I am in comparison"
Thoughts on this study comparing Vyvanse to Dexedrine?,What does this mean? Half life?
Thoughts on this study comparing Vyvanse to Dexedrine?,3-4 but I hardly notice it anymore after similar dose for 12 months
Thoughts on this study comparing Vyvanse to Dexedrine?,"The half-life is how long it takes for the medication to be half gone from the body. For amphetamine, it’s like 11 or 12 hours. So after taking Adderall or Vyvanse, it will take about 11/12 hours for half of it to be gone. 

Longer half life means it will linger in the body longer BUT that doesn’t mean you will notice it and benefit from it because the body eventually adjusts to it (tolerance). That is why long term patients may find that something like Vyvanse only works well for a few hours (the left side/ascending side of the graph above) but new patients feel it working for 10,11,12+ hours (they have no tolerance to it…yet). 

Methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta) has a very short half life of 3-4 hours. This is why methylphenidate medications are hard to adjust to. Rapid up and downs as it works and gets metabolized in the body. Like being on a roller-coaster….up down up down up down. Unlike being on a roller coaster, these kind of ups and downs are not fun."
Thoughts on this study comparing Vyvanse to Dexedrine?,Interesting! Were you taking multiple doses a day with Dex? I've heard about an increased risk of tolerance with multiple doses before.
Thoughts on this study comparing Vyvanse to Dexedrine?,Would all short a ring have rapid ups and downs then?
Thoughts on this study comparing Vyvanse to Dexedrine?,Short acting**
Thoughts on this study comparing Vyvanse to Dexedrine?,"Not amphetamine medications. Yes, a short acting adderall will stop working after 3-4 hours but because of that half life being longer it won’t drop you as fast. Most of us still notice it dropping but it isn’t even close to how bad it is with methylphenidate stimulants."

"Adderall works great for me, but the comedown is terrible. What are some ways you’ve mitigated the effects of the comedown? ",Protein with the pill. Don't forget to eat lunch. A snack. Tons of water all day. 
"Adderall works great for me, but the comedown is terrible. What are some ways you’ve mitigated the effects of the comedown? ","The comedown makes me feel super insecure about everything and my inner voice completely destroying me when I at my most weakest with all the stupid stuff I’ve done and all the opportunities I’ve wasted, all the people I’ve ghosted. It’s horrible. Coincides with bing eating, usually. 

What helps for me:

- halving my last dose. If you take two equal doses your overall level of adderall increases with every dose you take (because it’s not out of your system, just at its half life). 

- working out. High intensity stuff. You can’t solve problems of your brain, mentally; with the same brain. Solve it with physical acitivity. Getting your heart rate up high enough so you can’t really think anymore. 

- It’s a trade off. Be grateful for all the productive things you’ve done and feel free to wallow in self pity. You’ve deserved it. No joke. Try again tomorrow."
"Adderall works great for me, but the comedown is terrible. What are some ways you’ve mitigated the effects of the comedown? ","Extended release should help. Basically the crash comes because it's wearing off too fast. 

Vyvanse would likely give you the same effect with less of a crash but that is not much use if it's not covered. There is a generic available of this I believe now if you can ask your psychatrist."
"Adderall works great for me, but the comedown is terrible. What are some ways you’ve mitigated the effects of the comedown? ",Eat. Food. Warm food especially like 30 minutes before you usually start to feel the crash. Definitely eat enough protein. Get lots of exercise m even a 20 minute walk outside at the end of the day will help.
"Adderall works great for me, but the comedown is terrible. What are some ways you’ve mitigated the effects of the comedown? ","a few things that worsen the comedown are certain actions you take like not eating, drinking and exercising. a lack of sleep and medication specific problems can also worsen the comedown. a slow and steady raise in your blood amphetamine levels also means a slow decrease in levels. but adderall XR is not true XR like elevanse, it just releases the other half 4 hours later so you will have the same problems with IR. XR elevanse and even staggering the dose would allow for a more smooth rise and comedown.

i also use clonidine 0.025mg which is effective for amphetamine comedowns as it helps in controlling the norepinephrine and reducing irritation. helps for sleep too. another plus i noticed with clonidine is that it causes you to retain more water, which greatly helps in rehydrating late in the afternoon and during sleep, this helps in being better hydrated in the morning when taking your morning dose as amphetamines tend to dehydrate you. i personally always had problems retaining water and got dehydrated easily (walking around with salt at a beer drinking party cuz i get headaches from the dehydration and had a difficult time staying hydrated lol)"

"Adderall works great for me, but the comedown is terrible. What are some ways you’ve mitigated the effects of the comedown?

I try to eat breakfast (which is usually something substantial like eggs and toast or leftovers) early in the morning and take my pill either in the middle of eating or after I've finished. Eating a big nutritious also gets your metabolism going, which is really important if the stimulant tends to kill your appetite, as it does mine. 

Eat lunch if you can - I try to go for a protein, a slow release carb or just white rice or bread, and some veggies. If you can't stomach an entire meal, try to snack at semi-regular intervals throughout the day. Almonds, veggies and hummus, rolled up lunch meat and cheese (or mini sandwiches) are all good bets. Jerky, peanut butter on crackers, fruit, or a small portion of leftovers are all good bets, too. 

As others have said, drink lots of water and try to lay off the coffee (I know that can be hard). 

One last thing - I don't take Adderall anymore because the stimulant effects were just too much + I have anxiety and bipolar disorder. I now take Evekeo, a milder stimulant. I can feel the focusing effects without so many other negative effects. I don't have awesome insurance, but I get it for $60ish a month.

However: my insurance claims every year that it won’t cover it… and then, every year, within a month or two, it mysteriously does. But also, like most of the other stupidly expensive ones, they have a manufacturer’s coupon that will bring your cost down to the cost of a copay, if you have insurance and it’s not covered. 

And I mention it because Adderall XR was exactly the same for me—worked great; extremely hard crash at the end (usually while my work-day was still ongoing). Adzenys is the same drug, differently formulated, and seems to actually last a solid 10-11 hours for me—and while I can tell a difference between my functioning, say, *now*, vs. at 4:00 in the afternoon—there is no crash.

I got off the antidepressants because we realized the root cause is probably the ADHD, considering I'd been treated for depression for a decade, and it didn't seem to be beneficial enough once I was diagnosed with ADHD and realized what's causing the depression. Plus, all the fun side effects of antidepressants 🙃

Tell your doc about symptoms & he/she will write you another script for a low dose of IR to take mid afternoon.  Should be good after that.  For me personally, XR makes me have depression when the crash arrives, but IR never has.  My doctor wrote me a prescription for IR to take in the afternoon to offset it.  

Also, I’d recommend playing around with the timing of when you take the pills.  If you find yourself crashing off the 2nd dose as well, try and time it to where the crash comes when it’s bedtime & sleep through it.  It’s highly unlikely that you’ll have a 2nd crash bc the 2nd dose the doc gives you will be a low dose.  Just enough to take the edge off."

"Adderall works great for me, but the comedown is terrible. What are some ways you’ve mitigated the effects of the comedown? ","I don’t know if it will help for you, but I was just prescribed guanfacine 2mg (which is a blood pressure reducer & nonstimulant adhd med). I take it at night as it’s supposed to make you drowsy, but I found after the first few weeks it doesn’t make me that drowsy. But so far it helps with the racing heart / anxiety when adderall wears off. And I think it’s also helping with other general anxiety/ mood problems. 

I’m not one for meds but I need adderall to function and it’s the only type of psych med that doesn’t cause a million mental side effects (other than the typical crash problems), but the guanfacine seems to be helping that. It’s also been helping the mood effects on days I don’t take the adderall. I had no idea you could take a blood pressure med with a stimulant but I guess it’s safe. I’m definitely less irritable and have less of a short temper. I’m on adderall XR because I have less of a crash with the extended release.. IR gave me a lot of migraines with intense crashes, so if you’re taking IR maybe it’s worth the switch (or vice versa cuz everyone is different)."

Anxiety, irritability, rage… and that was even on a dose that was still not fully effective for me. Good news about Vyvanse is that the generic was released last year, which gives you a much cheaper alternative. The bad news is they can’t keep it in stock, so it’s hit or miss on whether they can fill the generic. The last couple of times I’ve had to get the branded version. My insurance covers most of it but the out of pocket was still a lot more."
"Adderall works great for me, but the comedown is terrible. What are some ways you’ve mitigated the effects of the comedown? ",Long and smooth is the worst combination for me
"Adderall works great for me, but the comedown is terrible. What are some ways you’ve mitigated the effects of the comedown? ","My doctor told me to take mine after breakfast but stay away from vitamin c.

I eat breakfast, wait an hour, then take it with a huge glass of water. 

Have been doing that now for three years, works like a charm."
"Adderall works great for me, but the comedown is terrible. What are some ways you’ve mitigated the effects of the comedown? ",I second this question … I’m so confused too whether this is accurate or not as I’ve heard the same
"Adderall works great for me, but the comedown is terrible. What are some ways you’ve mitigated the effects of the comedown? ","Yea I can definitely vouch for eating something that has a relatively well rounded nutritional profile. I took an IR in the morning for work when my breakfast was terrible, I actually think it was the day the cheese itz story happened, and I mainly just got a headache and was physically tired but mentally wired which was just uncomfortable enough to notice. Ended up getting a chipotle burrito on lunch and took my 2nd IR and and *that* dose had me feeling like I was touched by the light of god, locked in able to get shit done and an all encompassing feeling of good, like a hug from the universe. 

That was the day I realized I really needed to start being a bit more cognizant of what I was eating if I wanted my Adderall to actually work.

Big fan of the Rockin’ Protein Builder protein shakes from Shamrock Farms as well, 30g of protein 6g sugar, consistency is right between a smoothie and a milkshake. Worked like a charm to keep me and my XR from this morning kicking through lunch and even past the end of my work day. 

Ever since I started eating better I haven’t really noticed a bad comedown at all, just noticing it wearing off and returning to my old pre-medication normal, never falling below it into terrible comedown territory.

But seriously, don’t forget the water, I have been today and I have a fairly annoying headache right now and it’s completely my fault. Still feeling good overall because of what I ate but still, remember the water."
"Adderall works great for me, but the comedown is terrible. What are some ways you’ve mitigated the effects of the comedown? ",Yeah I think its basically the same as XR Vyvanse.

Dexedrine (or any ADHD medication in general): feeling sedated/sleepy/tired - please help me.,"That is a concern, but it does help me find ways to get out of ruts or analysis paralysis, overthinking, piling up obligations, and other stressors. I think my point is that do believe stress has caused a lot more damage to me physically than the medication has. 

Of course, in a perfect world, we would have neither stress nor medication to manage stress. But I think the benefits of the medication overall can help you establish and maintain healthier habits where medication may no longer be necessary. I do think it takes a little more work that that though because we do have to adapt to changes in our civilization... so I don't really know. 

I do think if you can find a way to take inventory of what your current situation is and if you believe you might need extra support (i.e., the meds) to get it to a place where you want to be or were before, then that's a really good place to look for your answer. I have been trying to do that more because sometimes we don't even realize when we've gone so far downhill until stuff gets *really* bad."

I just noticed my pharmacy filled Dexedrine instead of Adderall. Is it going to matter much?,Ring your pharmacist and talk to them about it. If a mistake they will correct it.
I just noticed my pharmacy filled Dexedrine instead of Adderall. Is it going to matter much?,"Very good that you are aware, always check.

It's important. Exactly what as already said. Wiki Adderal. It's 4 racemate salts type of stuff.

Dexamphetamine is one isomere. 

The slight change in medication can create a strong change if you are sensitive. So always be careful, good that you are checking.

Always stay aware. 

Btw: Look up some research dex-amphetamine is ""better"" (personal opinion and some papers ) shorter half life and less impact on cardiac stuff. 
 Check some papers and make up your mind. Personally haven't heard from any doctor or other adhd who ""still"" got any medication with contains the levo isomers."
I just noticed my pharmacy filled Dexedrine instead of Adderall. Is it going to matter much?,"They gave you the right thing. My pharmacy labels my generic just the same.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adderall


>	Adderall and Mydayis[4] are trade names[note 2] for a combination drug containing four salts of amphetamine. The mixture is composed of equal parts racemic amphetamine and dextroamphetamine, which produces a (3:1) ratio between dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine"
I just noticed my pharmacy filled Dexedrine instead of Adderall. Is it going to matter much?,"Yes, if they've given you Dexedrine instead of Adderall it will make a difference! I've gone back and forth between Adderall and Dexedrine several times for various reasons. Dexedrine (generic name is ""dextroamphetamine sulfate"") is NOT the same as Adderall (generic name is usually something like ""amphetamine - mixed salts""). Adderall DOES contain some proportion of Dexedrine, but pure Dexedrine and Adderall are not interchangeable. You should definitely go get this corrected. If you want to try going with just Dexedrine, that's fine, but in that case you should talk to your doctor and switch your prescription so you can give it a try. But if Adderall has been working for you, don't just start taking Dexedrine thinking it's the same, or even ""almost"" the same thing. Yes, they are both amphetamines, so they ARE similar, but Adderall is formulated to absorb differently into your system. The different salts (I think there are 3 of them, but don't quote me on that. I know one of them is the Dexedrine-type salt) each have different rates at which they are metabolized by your body, so you get a longer-acting, smoother response. Dexedrine will be metabolized all at the same rate, so you'll get a bigger bang, that won't last as long. So you may end up being more stimulated than you need, followed by a period of being relatively unmedicated."
I just noticed my pharmacy filled Dexedrine instead of Adderall. Is it going to matter much?,"You got good answers. Can confirm that dextrop-amphetamine means “mixture of dextroamphetamine and racemic amphetamine” which is unnecessarily confusing for someone who doesn’t know chemistry, as racemic amphetamine is a mixture of dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine. This is essentially just a chemical/generic name for Adderall. You’re good 👍 

In general, if you have questions about meds, best to call the *pharmacist* not the doctor. The pharmacist probably knows at least as well what is or isn’t safe, what’s equivalent, etc and they’re much easier to get ahold of!"

I just noticed my pharmacy filled Dexedrine instead of Adderall. Is it going to matter much?,"I hope that your anxiety has calmed. Just in case, I wanted to chime in and let you know that based on your bottle's labeling, you were prescribed the correct medication.

DEXTROAMP-AMPHETAMIN or **dextroamphetamine**\-**amphetamine** is a generic name for Adderall. It contains *both* dextroamphetamine and (levo)amphetamine. 

Adderall is also sometimes generically called **amphetamine salts** or **amphetamine salt combo** because it contains both dextroamphetamine and (levo)amphetamine in various salt forms:

* dextroamphetamine *sulfate*
* dextroamphetamine *saccharate*
* amphetamine *sulfate*
* amphetamine *aspartate monohydrate*

There is no difference between *dextroamphetamine-amphetamine*, *amphetamine salts* and *amphetamine salt combo*. These names all refer to the same drug containing 25% of each of the same four active ingredients mentioned above.

Dexedrine contains *only* the active ingredient dextroamphetamine in the form of dextroamphetamine sulfate. If you were prescribed Dexedrine, your bottle's labeling would say either DEXEDRINE or DEXTROAMPHETAMINE.

Hope that helps clear things up. Of course, talk to your doctor or pharmacist for reassurance."

I just noticed my pharmacy filled Dexedrine instead of Adderall. Is it going to matter much?,"Brand names are confusing and can cause SALAD errors (**S**ound **A**like **L**ook **A**like **D**rug) on the prescribing side.

""Adderall? Which one? IR or XL? 37.5mg? That's not Adderall; that's Mydayis and it's not dosed 1:1 to Adderall because it hits children 21 - 31% harder. If only there was a safer and more accurate name.""

""Kef***lex***? Are you sure? This guy's ***super*** allergic to penicillin. Oh you meant Kef***zol*** - a totally different drug that won't kill him. If only there a safer and more accurate name.""

The generic name is best.

Dextroamphetamine/Amphetamine is a mouthful but less confusing.

Amphetamine salts is easier but more confusing.

Both are the same thing and both are better more accurate names than just Adderall."

how is dexedrine doing in shortage?,I used Dexedrine before the shortage and for a while I had no problems but now they’ve been giving out Dex to adderal folks in light of the shortage and now Dexedrine is in a shortage. I’m so tired of this I miss the days when Dexedrine was lowkey obscure and not really used by many people. This shortage is driving me nuts and I swear the Dexedrine they’re giving me now isn’t as potent as the one I had before. Just a mess all around
how is dexedrine doing in shortage?,[removed]
how is dexedrine doing in shortage?,"how can you blame people for switching? taking dex away? what makes original dex patient special from other adhd patients? many adhd patients can't continue their daily life, prioritizing themself switching to dex to continue their daily life is wrong? why don't you rather argue that mild adhd patients should take off their meds and criticize those people for not taking off their meds. rather blaming those people, blame DEA for being stupid since blaming those ppl won't change a shit while blaming DEA can change a shit"
how is dexedrine doing in shortage?,I just went through your recent posts and saw you spent a good ammount of time attacking people for desperately trying new medications. Do you really not have anything better to do? OP asked a very understandable question. No need to be a jerk.
how is dexedrine doing in shortage?,"OP, don't even bother. u/AquaticAnxieties is going around sending rage responses to anyone asking about Dex. I'll give you a real response.

If you struggle with anxiety, anger, emotional ups and downs, I strongly recommend not trying Dex. I've seen a lot of posts recently where people who have tried it ended up nearly hospitalized because of the emotional impact. If you do try Dex, you should start at 5mg because while it's one of the salts *in* adderall, it's the salt that feels like actual speed. 

I took Dexedrine for about 2 weeks and it was a living nightmare. I was extremely short tempered. In constant fight or flight, and honestly was not able to focus better. It was actually harder than being unmedicated. That's just my experience though - but I've seen a lot like mine.

I would encourage you to check out Wellbutrin if you haven't considered it before. It takes a few weeks to adjust to, but it's helped me a lot. I've been waking up with lots of energy but not too much. It's also emotionally regulating (after you've adjusted to it.) It doesn't work for everyone but it's been really life-saving for me, especially amidst the adderall shortage. I don't even want to go back on adderall when the shortage ends now."

how is dexedrine doing in shortage?,"Woah there.

I switched to Dexedrine ER from Adderall ER, and I got much better results with Dexedrine.

1) the rebound effect was way less severe
2) I had less anxiety on Dex and less rage when it wore off.
3) the dose MUST be adjusted between Adderall and Dexedrine, because Dexedrine is more potent. So if you’re taking 10mg Adderall, do NOT start with 10mg Dex.

Granted, I was taking generic options for both."
how is dexedrine doing in shortage?,"I didn't say you insulted anybody. You are however, accusing users asking about Dexedrine of being the reason you can't access your meds. This is a support group. A whole lot of us here are having to pivot. Your pointless hostility should be called out."
how is dexedrine doing in shortage?,"Take your shit but don't spread it. Four minutes being a hostile asshole to people looking for help in an ADHD **""peer support group""** is four-minutes too long."
how is dexedrine doing in shortage?,"No bickering, fighting, flame wars, trolling, name-calling, or personal insults."
how is dexedrine doing in shortage?,"You are absolutely correct! Dexedrine should not be given at the same mg as Adderall, and yet it seems like a lot of doctors are. Mine did - I didn't realize until I was long-done with it that I was taking THREE TIMES the average dose. (No wonder it was a nightmare.)

Thanks for bringing back this thread because I forgot to come back and clarify that!"

Anyone get tired on Dexedrine or other ADHD meds?,"I feel relaxed on my Stimulant medication that I just got prescribed.

In 2 weeks I have an appointment and will discuss on upping it or not.

So far I don’t have any side effects and I’m super happy about it!"
Anyone get tired on Dexedrine or other ADHD meds?,"I feel tired when i had stimulants and haven't had enough water. Water seems like THE thing that lessens side-effects and tiredness on stimulants. Coffee would often make it worse, until I've had sufficient water. Its like my body goes ""you want up? you want focus? you want to do something today? Nu-uh! Drink your water till your brain clears up! punk!"". Which can be hard, because I'm never really thirsty, AND because its so boring. So i use big water bottles that i scarf down, as quickly as i can, to not die of boredom."
Anyone get tired on Dexedrine or other ADHD meds?,"5mg is a very low dose, so that's probably the reason. You might do better taking 10mg twice a day (about 5 hours apart). If you need to dose every 3 hours, that's a sign that your dose is too low."
Anyone get tired on Dexedrine or other ADHD meds?,"Yeah I took 144mg of concerta (yes you read that correctly) and that’s because it acted as a depressant, so it brought my mood down, and then took 40mg of celexa to balance me out. It sucked for a while, but Vivans (definitely spelled wrong) gave me seizures. 

In short, yes."
Anyone get tired on Dexedrine or other ADHD meds?,When I started with 10 I’d be over stimulated and it didn’t  last any longer. Raising the dose doesn’t increase the duration but yeah I probably need 10mg 3-4x a day because I probably have some tolerance now.

Feel like Dexedrine is causing headaches when Adderall did not,"I was googling Reddit for this exact same thing. After switching I have been having aura migraines everyday and feeling like my brain is misfiring. Pharmacist and doc are saying they are the exact same thing but I’m doubtful. 

What did you end up doing? Did you stop the dexedrine?"
Feel like Dexedrine is causing headaches when Adderall did not,"I talked to my doctor about it, and he said that sometimes switching meds can have a transition period even if they both contain the same ingredient. Adderall is a mix of 75% dextroamphetamine and 25% levoamphetamine, and while we know how each molecule affects the body, we don't always know how they interact together within everyone's body. It's possible the levoamphetamine was allowing extra bloodflow to my brain and preventing the headaches, but it's impossible to know for sure. I stuck with the dexedrine for another month to see if the headaches went away, and they pretty much did (I can't know if EVERY headache I get is bc of the dex). Try ensuring you are staying hydrated and eating well while taking the dexedrine, as dehydration and low blood sugar can also contribute to headaches."

(You can find this information on the bottle where it says MFR.) I take Dex IR as well, and I prefer the Teva brand, although Sunrise Pharma has worked well for me too. I've tried KVK Tech and it was horrible. So it might be the manufacturer, not the medication."
Dexedrine experience. Vyvanse next. Thoughts?,"I don’t have any advice for you, but I am experiencing the same as you are. It takes forever to get up in the morning, I can’t get anything done and I am not motivated for anything really.

I have tried lowering the dosage, and it is a bit better, but then I have very little effect on my adhd symptoms:/ I wonder if a higher dosage would be better? But I get very chatty sometimes on Dexedrine and I don’t like that, so I am worried about increasing.

I have been on Vyvanse. I was a flat zombie on them sadly :("

Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,I severely hate making phone calls but this one may have to happen. I'm on Focalin right now since it's all my pharmacy can get in stock and I'm not sure how to feel about it. Doesn't seem to help and I go from rage to crying in 5 seconds flat. Ugh.
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,Tell them it will put your ability to pay taxes at risk.
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"Great advice, thank you.  My biggest concern is people resorting to self medication with street drugs.  I really hope this gets resolved soon."
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,Imagine if we told people to just go without their glasses for a month or told them to ration wearing them and not wear them on weekends or only for half the day.  This is exactly what it’s like for someone with a legitimate disability to be unable to get their medication.

Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"I’m in a 30 day refill state. There’s at least two days in a row every month I can’t take my meds because of refill delays. Guess which days I have a lot of problems at work?

Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,Also they didn't really do shit about the baby formula shortage. I often cannot find formula for my baby.
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"I just got a letter saying my medical insurance will only cover brand name Adderall beginning Jan 1, they will no longer cover generic!  I don’t get it."
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"They only refill once every 29 to 30 days they can’t refill it before I have been told. Also, it doesn’t matter if you use insurance or don’t they still will not refill it before 30 days 29 if you’re lucky. Also at the beginning of the year , some Big organization -maybe dea ???? —I forget the name , in the USA  decides how much stimulant medication in general we will need based on how much we used, a.k.a. how much doctors prescribed last year — and bases, what they manufacture/order/make available to us for the next upcoming year based on that.

they actually said it would be a percent lower next year than we needed this year. So if we think we have problems this year, we’re all going to be running out in March next year. Not to scare anyone, but we all need to speak up. we all need to do some thing. Instead of sitting here bitching on Reddit and writing to each other we need to be bitching to whoever runs our country or state or city are medical boars are hospitals, or pharmacies, and writing to them instead. At least that would do some thing that could help us.

I have horrific ADHD and was diagnosed 30 years ago. It takes me ungodly amounts of time to write letters or call people, yet after I read that I managed to write multiple letters, make multiple phone calls, and I even went online to find places where I could I fill out letters to anybody in the country/medical field/pharmaceutical field, ETC that might help.

 And there’s links that take you to different websites that you can write letters to people that we need more and we can’t run out of this medicine ever again like we did this year. It could be life-threatening, think of driving on medicated, think of the depression from being on medicated and the stress, it causes, and a snowball effect. This is not a joke. And if they’re seriously going to have less next year than they did this year I don’t even want to think about that. 

We need to all speak up and make a change. I am the queen of procrastinating on phone calls and letters and bills months on end, but this is important enough that I was able to make myself do these things the same day. Because I cannot imagine Going without my meds for the rest of my life or even for a whole year. My life would be such a disaster because I’ve been there and done that in the past, and it led me to very dark dark scary places that I never want to go again, just a heads up and FYI and up we all need to do our part instead of just bitch about it. Let’s face it we can all right paragraphs upon paragraphs here and read it, see my above writing I just did it right? I have severe ADHD severe… And I did it, so you can too. Instead of just writing to each other unless it’s helpful information that can guide others or teach others how they can make a difference, let’s focus our efforts, at least for the next few weeks on writing to people who can make a change for us!!

Bitching to each other about how we can’t get our meds it’s fine, but it’s not gonna change anything anymore especially when we’re almost at the end of this year. Because if all we do is bitch to each other about not being able to get our meds, guess what happens next year even earlier… Just please do some thing. If you write one letter one email make one phone call one person that maybe could contact another person higher up, you’ve done something to help And I Thank you sincerely for that effort. I am horrible at writing to people and making profiles and all of that, but when it’s some thing, I’m passionate about, and especially when it’s something that affects my ability to live my best life, that something that not only do I know myself, and all of us can do, but it really is our duty to do so to help ourselves and everyone else who suffers because of this. Let’s make our voices heard! 

I mean God there’s so many of us we could be so damn loud. If we just all try to reach out to one person I swear, I truly believe that could change everything —so let’s do it. It’s not hurting anyone, and maybe next year there won’t be thousands of Reddit posts about not being able to get our meds or how our lives have sucked for months because we are unmedicated…"

Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"I think a problem is that the FDA has no legal authority to order a drug company to make more of a medication, and in my opinion it is unsuitable that drugs and much else of health care is left to the free market. 

I suspect that these drug companies could make more of these medicine if they really wanted to, but that their choices are determined by their own economic interests. For example, I need that the Adderall maker Teva explained of worker shortages, but if they offered to pay their workers higher wages it seems it would be easier for them to keep workers or secure new workers quicker than they otherwise would have.

Ultimately, I think these drug companies might decide it would be better to purposely underproduce now and then to sell more next year when economist predict continued inflation. 

If it would be the case that they are holding on to stock to make more money in the long run, I think we would all agree that something is broken in this system."

Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"Um, as much as I support the medication(though vyvanse works better for me), I'd say they are more concerned with homelessness.   I'm in Delaware(yeah I'm aware of Wayne's World, especially since I moved to Delaware FROM Aurora Illinois-EXCELLENT-when that movie was quite popular), and it's disturbing. 
I will say that starving babies might be a priority but honestly,  what happened to fucking birth control? Between covid and the ODs rising everyday making ot the leading cause of death these days, how are we still managing to be overpopulated? I have ONE daughter and I love her but I can't fathom wanting to bring a child into this helping pile of human apathy. If it comes to it, my husband, daughter and I will do the good old cult kool-aid means of expiring. Hope the next life is a better one 😆😘"

Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"So my doctor prescribed me Dextroamphet. According to him, Adderall is made up of two different types of active ingredients and this is one of them. I started taking it this month and it is working just fine.

Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"My doc sent my normal Add Rx to CVS but they won't fill it because it suddenly requires pre authorization. Nothing changed with my insurance and I've been on the same Rx forever. Never required pre auth. CVS says I can't pay out of pocket because CVS is ""legally required"" to send it through insurance (when insured). So they'd need approval from my doc to let me pay full price for the medication he submitted. This is the dumbest excuse I've ever heard. Seems like a cover story for an Add shortage!"

Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"Been on regular Adderall 30 mg (Teva was the only brand that worked for me)but insurance decided to no longer cover it. Now got switched to Adderall XR 30 and I can't find it anywhere it's so frustrating. I been calling multiple pharmacies and no luck, to make matters worse I also take generic Xanax for anxiety which is also hard to find here in Houston, Texas . My ADHD triggers my anxiety and honestly I feel like no one takes me seriously when I ask what the issue is with the medication shortage.

Im sitting here on Reddit instead of doing what I should be doing, and Im on Vyvanse, which hasn’t been affected by the shortage. Yet. LOL!"
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"I was told to call around to try hunting for it.  After 5 with no luck I asked if I could be switched to Vyvanse so I don't have to do that every month, because it wasn't sustainable.  GP sent it over no problem.  Who knows, it might work better for me anyway."
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,it took me like six months to fill out the DSM-V self-assessment lol I think psychiatrists could stand to be a little more accommodating in this specific instance

Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,At least there is a suggested script.  :)
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"Ugh indeed! Im so sorry this is affecting you. I hate making phone calls too, and I was literally crying when I spoke to the poor interns that answer the phone, but they were really nice and said they love hearing from their constituents.

Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,I called my pharmacy this morning and they told me that Concerta is on backorder.  They've been trying for several months (which I'm guessing is actually 3) to get it .   They said I could call my dr. and ask to send it to another pharmacy but there is no guarantee that they would even have it.  I do not understand how they could be backordered for multiple months.
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,I’m on Adderall 20 mg twice a day. Been without it since October. I keep checking with my pharmacy daily. On Thursday they actually had it ! They said they order everyday and once in awhile they will get a bottle. (I’m in NYC)
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,What state are you in?
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,I went 6 weeks. Finally got vyvanse prescribed and got it filled even though it cost me a pretty penny.
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"Im assuming you take the Extended Release pills. 

If that is true, you might be able to get your doctor to also prescribe the short acting pills, which could tide you over on (normal non shortage) refill days. 

Thats what I do. 

Actually…..I take a short term Adderall “bump” in the afternoon. I told my doctor the 10mg work great, but I actually split them in half. That way I have a back log of them (which is what Im using to mitigate my daughter’s lack of ER Adderall. She *also* has a script for the short acting Adderall so its all legal)

The only problem is then I can go *days* without making it to the pharmacy because I know I have the back up pills. LOL!"
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"I had my first kid March 2020, spent the first year of life in lockdown. My second kid was born a week before the formula shortage (my wife works, can’t breastfeed). Literally, I think we changed formula brands 20-25 times during that first year. 

I’m currently 415 days into a wait for a Ford maverick I ordered in 2021 (chip shortages). 

And last week I spent at least 15 hours calling and driving to different pharmacies just to fill one prescription of Adderall. 

I’m so fucking done with the 2020’s."
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,Yeah we still had to buy formula every few days because there was really only 1 tiny can available after searching several stores
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,These aren't easy problems that can be fixed in a timely manner unfortunately.
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,[removed]
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,Mine did that last year with the XR. My afternoon breakthrough dose is still generic.
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,That is insane!
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,LOL! I tried to make it as easy as possible. Should I add anything to make it easier?
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"I totally agree with you, but in this specific instance, the solution is allowing drug manufacturers to make *more pills*, thereby allowing them to make more money! So this is kinda the red state dream!!!"
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"How much was yours if you don't mind me asking?

Mine was more expensive this month, and that's after I called 13 pharmacies looking for anyone who had Adderall XR in stock. I gotta drive 45 minutes to get it in a day or two 😩"
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"If you are able to get Adderall or the generic version and the price has risen, its absolutely the shortage. Well, that and inflation."
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,It’s cheaper at the target pharmacies (in my experience I save like $20).
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"It will be interesting to look at the suicide rate in patients with adhd during this shortage. Its criminal to force thousands of people into detox. It’s beyond demoralizing to be forced to call 40 pharmacies, sounding like a junkie looking for a high. I’be been prescribed this medication for almost a decade. The withdrawal symptoms are crippling. If I had known this was coming, I could have rationed my dose (to taper off slowly)."
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"WTF. The two things are completely different! An SSRI mostly enhances serotonin and the ADHD medications (stimulants) mostly enhances dopamine. 

I seriously cant with the ignorance of basic science sometimes."
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,This is news to me. Catch me on day 9 of withdrawing from stimulants while I chart my patient care into the late hours

Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,[deleted]
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"In my state. I need to call/request a refill to my doctor. Then my doc needs to review/approve the refill then it goes automatically to the pharmacy and it's filled. My doc and clinic aren't set up to do multiple month refills so every month I need doc to authorize a refill because it's also a restricted drug. Other drugs that aren't restricted, doctors can usually write X refills and when you're out then they'll reach out to your doctor. 

My pharmacy and doc don't allow Adderall to be auto refilled, so no automated system to request refills days before it needs to be refilled."
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"There isn’t a waiting period that I know of in my state (California) that I know of, but maybe its different in other states? I know I can only get a prescription filled like one day before mine runs out, which is infuriating. So maybe they have to wait until your current prescription is done before they can officially refill?"
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"No it's not....The metabolite of vyvanse is the dextro but it has to be processed by the liver first, Higher doses just make it last longer. softer up and down but i found it was ineffective and depletes a couple key enzymes commonly used by other drugs."

Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"I hear you, and understand why you feel that way. And you might be right. I guess I never really cared if someone hates me or not, and this is their job. If they actually hate me, why not make them do some work? LOL!"
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,You’d be surprised. We just need enough people to call. Not just once.
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"The medication is for my daughter who has severe ADHD. She wont die without it, but it severely disrupts her behavior at school. So much so that I just got back from a meeting with the school to come up with an emergency plan to implement if she runs out of the back-up short-acting pills. 

As for the baby formula situation, the similarity isn’t the life and death aspect, its that a major part of the problem is the strict government regulation. If our government can quickly raise the amount of pills the manufacturers can produce, it would end the shortage. 

The shortage was caused by the government allowing Adderall to be prescribed over the phone and then the mail pharmacies to deliver it. That caused a large spike in the amount of pill demand, but then the government did NOT raise the amount of pills the manufacturers are legally allowed to make, thereby causing a false supply/demand shortage. 

They created this problem so they need to fix it ASAP. 

That is why its important to actually call your elected representatives. Let them know how their actions are affecting you and that they need to clean up their mess."

Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"We have removed your post/comment because it contains antipsychiatry, denialism, or discourages treatment."
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"I think that is the generic form of Adderall, because that is what my daughter takes. It works so much better than anything else, even the brand name Adderall. Unfortunately its completely sold out where I live in California."
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"I dont know much about your female senator, but Manchin would probably love to hear from you! 

Ok I did a quick google of the lady and she used to be an educator, so I bet if you said something about how important your education is and how debilitating it is to not have your medication in regards to your classes, it might help. But she isnt the one answering the phone or anything, so I think just hearing from you would be a good thing."
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,I’m on generic and it’s starting to be a problem. Every month it’s a different brand and this month they could only give me a 17 day supply.  They said to keep checking and they can fill the rest when it comes in.
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,Yes. It’s awful. :(
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,Yup. I specifically mentioned allowing the drugs to come from other countries in order to mitigate the shortage just like they did with the baby formula.
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,I thought so but it hit this month.  I only was able   To get a 17 day supply because that’s all they had. I may try some smaller pharmacies instead of CVS.
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"Yes, I started a generic version of adderall last month and so far both fills have been cheap and fast. I'm in Oregon."
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"I’ve not had problems filling my or my son’s scripts, but holy moly has the price risen!"
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"I was in Oct/Nov, but not at my latest refill."
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"Ive read that MA (or at least Boston) doesnt seem to be as severely affected as other states, but I dont know why. Im crossing my fingers for you!"
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"Im on Vyvanse and love it, but it made my daughter go kookoo. If I cant get her script filled in the next few weeks Im going to be forced to have her try it again. This shit is *insane*!"
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,It’s so expensive though!
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"So for *me*, the immediate release has been affected, but it hasn’t been as bad. My daughter has the refill on its way. But her extended release was cancelled because the pharmacy said they have no date for when it will be filled. Nightmare."
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"My Aunt has ADHD, but stopped taking meds (Concerta) due to her age and medical condition. She's basically a hoarder and for some reason would skip after afternoon dose. She gave me her supply, and it was like 400 days worth for me. No more freaking out over supply issues from my pharmacy."
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"So I use CVS and have heard the same thing in regards to only being able to go through insurance, but this was before the shortage. Im literally on hold with my health insurance because CVS has always told me I can only get 30 at a time *because of my insurance*. Im trying to get them to bump the amount up to 90. 

Oddly, they said I *can* get 90 if I use CVS Cares, the delivery service, but its currently sold out there so the script got cancelled. 

The whole thing is insane!"
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,You can absolutely opt to pay out of pocket if your insurance won’t cover it.
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"I mean, I did but I have no idea if anyone else did. Its a long shot to get people with ADHD to call their government representatives. LOL!"
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"Well, considering the fact that government policies literally caused and are prolonging the shortage…"
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,This is awesome. You are awesome. 👏🏼👍🏼
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"Thank you for posting this! I was pissed about having to ration my medicine a few days ago and vowed to find a script to send and then I promptly forgot about it. I'm not on Adderall, but that shortage has led to my medication being prescribed more and more it's short too. I wonder if we can convince them to make the DEA increase the production cap. Not fair we have to suffer because people abuse it."
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"Yeah I live in a smaller suburb of a bigger metro area so I haven’t had issues. Probably because we get the same supply as surrounding bigger cities, but it’s mostly old people who live here."
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,">Im sitting here on Reddit instead of doing what I should be doing, and Im on Vyvanse, which hasn’t been affected by the shortage. Yet. LOL!

Argh yeah

Makes me wonder if Adderall or Ritalin would be better...!"
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"Got vyvanse too but didn’t really like it at all. Plus, now I’ve got a headache!"
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,So far Ritalin is safe. :/
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"Vyvanse was my least favorite. I react strangely to meds and Vyvanse gave me depression. It’s also really expensive and depending on your insurance, difficult to get covered. Even with insurance, I still had to pay $100 out of pocket."
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,Try Dexedrine.
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,Oh I know. My sister is a pharmacy tech and I feel so sorry for all the pharmacy staff and staff at the doctors offices having to rectify the situation. It's not easy for them either I'm sure! I live in Indiana.
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"I made the same switch and I’m hating it. Not only is it more expensive the side effects suck. Headache, anxiety, and less motivation. Arrgh."
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,I just saw a post on here last night that said someone was having to see their doctor to switch because Focalin is now short!! 😭 I really wish this stuff would get sorted out soon.

I’ll definitely try and call bc honestly what else can I do lol"

Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"My babe has reflux and she's very sensitive to formula and dairy and even though she does best with soy formula I've had to give her basically anything I could find including toddler formula and cows milk. I'm so grateful that she's about to be a year old and we can be done dealing with this one thing.

After waiting 8 months for a car we ordered we just cancelled it and took the deposit back."
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"Not really - the reason insurance does that is because they made a deal with the name brand suppliers - it can still make the covered name brand more expensive for the “consumer” (gross word for someone having to buy medication), and buying generic means that it 1) isn’t covered *at all* by insurance and therefore 2) that payment doesn’t go towards your yearly deductible even though it’s literally cheaper in every way. It’s a little secret deal the insurance company makes so that name brand adderall still gets a share of the market even though generic is cheaper, not because it actually benefits the consumer/patient or whatever. 

Also, name brand or generic the shortage is affecting both, or at least where I’m at. 

Sincerely, 

someone who just had to enroll in state insurance and had to look this exact phenomena up…and is also completely out of any kind of adderall/generic ER and cannot afford the hundreds to pay for Vyvanse while still uninsured"
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"Oh okay, my pharmacy has the option to leave a voice message when calling in a refill so I will for sure do that!  My assumption was that the change had to be related to financial greed and that it would me another thing that will end up costing more.  But I dunno.  Thanks!"

Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,Is it? I feel like this is very dependent on insurance too. I just picked up my 15mg twice a day adderall IR for $10 for a 30 day supply.
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,Most likely Welbutrin as it used off-label for ppl with adhd. It increases dopamine levels in the brain. Shows to work for alot of ppl that can't handle stim side effects or have substance abuse with history of addiction. Also helps stop nicotine cravings to quit smoking and works as antidepressant as well. I gave it ago before getting back on Adderall for my Dr. But had really bad side effects having Vertigo and Nuasea.Great for ppl who bad1 side effect from ssri's whci work on serotonin Welbutrin o. The other hand work on Dopamine & Norepinephrine which is classed as a NDRI. Wish it worked for me but Adderall seems to work best out of all I've tried.
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,Can’t wait till the robots are good enough to do this job.
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,Hmm that’s a good point. It would have been right on 30 days when it was ready this last week. I hadn’t thought of that. I just know that it’s a lot harder to get medicine than it used to be.
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,I’m in California as well and I work for a hospital and the pharmacy there is out as well. They told me other patients are waiting as well and no idea when they will be getting a supply in. Really sucks.

Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,It's a healthcare issue..it's absolutely a conservative problem.
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"For real. To have a mental health med that some people have taken for years just completely stopped cold turkey is a mess. I made the choice to stop breastfeeding my baby because my mental health was suffering due to PPD/ADHD. Was only back on my Adderall for 2 months before it was taken away due to shortage. So now what? We weren't on the easiest path of breastfeeding but I would not have given up had I known I soon wouldn't be able to access my meds. How insensitive for someone to comment this. Even my 7 year old who has severe ADHD (and yes, we've tried everything short of meds OP) had to have his meds changed because his methylphenidate also wasn't coming in. This person is wildly tone deaf and I hope they leave this sub asap. You're not helping the stigma against us, OP. Bye."

Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"well shit. Sorry to hear that. As I had it explained to me, it is the one of the two active ingredients in Adderall and the more effective of the two."
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,No. Adderall is a combined medication. It's amphetamine/dextroamphetamine. Dexedrine is just dextro.
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"Phew, thank god. Thank you! I have my fingers crossed too!"
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"Good luck! I hope you guys figure it out. I tried 50 mg Vyvanse which was to much, then 20 which wasn't enough.

Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"> I'm not on Adderall, but that shortage has led to my medication being prescribed more and more it's short too.

**THISSSSS**

>I wonder if we can convince them to make the DEA increase the production cap. 

**ALSO THISSSSSSSSS** 

It is my belief this is the solution. Im also under the impression its the FDA, not DEA, but Im not an expert. Either way, you know who “controls” both? Frickin’ *Congress*. Hence why Im advocating contacting them."
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,When I worked in a pharmacy our limit to how much of a schedule 2 substance we could fill had to do with the total number of prescriptions filled at the store. We would always hit the limit with stimulants but not with opioids because of the demographics of our customers.
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"Yes. Surrounding area demographics may play a bigger roll in locating a pharmacy which can fill Adderall prescriptions during this shortage. 
-
At the end of the summer my usual pharmacy said they are no longer filling Stimulant prescriptions due to the shortage. 
Tried calling 20+ pharmacies, and the only one of them that had NO issues filling my medication is located in a neighborhood thats known for having “quiet/mature residents, and a low turnover of people moving from rental units”. 
  I have been getting my adderall IR Refilled there every month since and have never waited more than 72 hours. The only thing I can think is that this pharmacy is located far away from colleges, Trendy Areas, and young adult crowds, Etc… . 
-
When checking for a new pharmacy to fill your scrip of any stimulant try also checking out the neighborhood that it’s located in. 
This could be a good trick to finding a pharmacy/pharmacist that can/will fill your Adderall RX. 
Hope this helps"
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"I once read (maybe even here on this subreddit) that the medication helps one focus, but it doesnt help what one focuses on. LOL!"

Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,What dose are you able to get
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"Why?

I tried Dexedrine and it was so up and down. Vyvanse is much smoother etc.

But, also not sure if it works quite as well."

Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"I’ve been super lightheaded. Every time I get up out of my seat I feel like I’m floating.

Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"I wonder if that would work. I’ll ask the doctor, but at the moment, and Im 100% venting RN, Im *furious* with the doctor. I happened to find it at a local pharmacy (they just got it in) so I immediately called at 10am, spoke to the doctor and he said he would send it in. Its been seven hours and the store doesnt have the prescription. Ive emailed and called. Tomorrow is the last day the office will be open for two weeks. 

Im just so fucking livid about this. 

Im out here calling senators and they cant be bothered to send a prescription. For the record, this is at a preeminent ADHD clinic so this is literally all they do."
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,I’m on XR and they stopped being able to fill it consistently about 6 weeks ago here (Maine). I think it’s technically an IR shortage that is causing a ripple effect and shortages of other medicines as ppl switch.

Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,DEA sets the quota for manufactures.
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,Welllllllllll kind of sort Congress. Congress created the agency but they don’t control the agencies. At least until Gorsuch gets his way.
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"It's the DEA.  Wouldn't be America if we actually put drug regulations and manufacturing quotas under the long-eastablished regulatory agency staffed by medical professionals, under the umbrella of health and human services, y'know.

Thank god this is America, so such things are managed by cops and ex-military.  Who certainly don't have a vested interest in making it appear they're doing something about the *insert drug du jour* ""epidemic"", no way.  

Much easier and safer for them to bully doctors and patients since drug cartels tend to shoot back."
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,In what easy do the demographics of the customers affect this?

Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,Yes! Nothing mattered because the only thing that was real was the big sad.
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,I’m back on adderall but was doing 20mg 2/day.
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,Because it’s cheaper and easier to find. Plus Vyvanse dones weird shit to some people. But do you. I’m just some random internet persona making suggestions.
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"Wait, this is relevant to me since I visit family... all my perscriptions are digital, am I going to have to request a copy from my pharmacy or something?"
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"Because I work with teenagers who would totally just take a pill off the floor or take shit out of my bag and take the pill.

Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,[removed]
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"Vyvanse is also dextro (well something else that the body turns into dextro). There are a couple other brands that do the mix too, but probably none of them will be covered by insurance. I forget what they're called now, but I remember one dissolved in your mouth and tasted like orange, cause that's the one I want to try 😆 but yeah Google it cause I think there was like 4 of them (I made a list... It's somewhere). They also have some coupons and stuff if your insurance doesn't cover. I haven't tried any of them but just sharing because I hadn't even heard of them before I went searching due to the shortage."
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"Good luck!! When is ""next tiime."" Do they have an estimate on when it will be back in supply?"
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,Ugh. They need to raise that shit ASAP!
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,Most of our customers were under 50. So it meant a relatively high amount of people being treated for ADHD and a relatively low amount with chronic pain.
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,Things felt less real on vyvanse?
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"Well reason I ask is I’ve tried both and unsure which is better for me. And vyvanse maybe it does do weird things. Like, is there a link to worsening depression?"
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,From your Dr.
Adderall Shortage: Call your Rep and Senators!,"OMG! That’s horrible! Like now I get it….but also….Is that a thing that happens? Like how could you get in trouble if you had a medication you needed (which you do) and a kid *stole* it? 

Like….is there a place you could keep your pills that is safe? A teacher’s lounge? Your car? There *must* be some kind of lockbox pill container.

How long does 5mg of Dexedrine last for you?,"When I took dexedrine, a 5mg non time release tablet lasted about 3 hours before I needed another."
How long does 5mg of Dexedrine last for you?,"i had the exact same dosage of both meds about a year ago. 5mg dexedrine lasted about 3 hours. 

for me it was helpful for doing mundane tasks that i needed the motivation for later in the day like chores and stuff. i wanted to use it for school for days that i had an extra heavy workload but i found that it made my patience thin in a way? like trying to learn something new and getting stuck i wud get way more frustrated when i had the dex so i stopped using it for that. always depends on the person and the intended use 

i hope it works well for u!"
How long does 5mg of Dexedrine last for you?,Interesting. I was going into it figuring 5mg is low so only expect 2.5-3 hours of coverage.  Do you currently take anything now?
How long does 5mg of Dexedrine last for you?,yes now i’m taking 40mg vyvanse and just drinking a lot of coffee lmao
How long does 5mg of Dexedrine last for you?,"but vyvanse lasts longer for me than it does for you also , like 5-7 hours before i start to rly notice my attention span die"
How long does 5mg of Dexedrine last for you?,Yeah that whole 10-14 hours of effective coverage is a bit of a scam huh?😂
How long does 5mg of Dexedrine last for you?,"lmaoo yea if only i cud be functional in the evening what a thought

but i guess in some ways it does work that long like for example if i skip meds one day i become an absolute evil gremlin bitch but like that doesn’t happen to me every evening when it’s ’worn off’ so i think the whole effect lasts that long but the second half is more subtle"
How long does 5mg of Dexedrine last for you?,For me some days I have noticed it comes and goes in waves. For me it works well for 3ish hours. I have a crash and 30 minutes later I’m alert and focused-motivated for another 2ish hours and it slowly fades out. Some days it’s almost a roller coaster on off on off on off.  Today was the first day with the dextroamp booster and it’s almost like the booster dose is smoother and more consistent than the vyvanse.
How long does 5mg of Dexedrine last for you?,wow it’s so wild how different these things work for everyone bc for me the dex was too up and down and vyvanse is rly smooth. brains man
How long does 5mg of Dexedrine last for you?,Dropped the vyvanse. Been on 5mg of Dexedrine 4 times a day. It’s been great. We are going to try and up the dose next week to 7.5 and see how I respond. I’ve noticed a huge increase in my ability to manage my emotions.
How long does 5mg of Dexedrine last for you?,omg love that for u
Vyvanse or Dexedrine,"I take both every day and have been on Adderall (never again). 

Vyvanse is a pro-drug of the active ingredient in Dexedrine, which means that the body converts the Vyvanse into Dexedrine throughout the day. Think of it like a super extended release. So the differences in feeling come from the intensity of the dose/how quickly it’s released. 

Vyvanse is very smooth when it kicks in and wears off, to the point where many (including myself) barely notice. It was created to be more difficult to abuse and more stable/consistent. 

Dexedrine kicks in much more quickly and has more of a crash for me. Almost like caffeine. 

I’m severely hyperactive so they both make me more drowsy/calm. When I tried Adderall I felt the intense “focus” that everyone was talking about, but it turns out I was just experiencing anxiety and not getting anything done. Inattentive people seem to have a better reaction to the additional ingredient in Adderall, but everyone is different. 

As someone diagnosed later in life with a heavy professional psychology background, I conceptualist it like this: Everyone has a limited amount of cognitive function within a day. These medications can focus all of that cognition into a laser beam for however long they are active, but they don’t create cognition. Increasing your sleep, hydration, nutrition, etc. can help raise the limit over time but it is a finite resource. The longer lasting medications give you a weaker laser beam for longer and the short acting medications give you a stronger laser beam for a shorter amount of time."
Vyvanse or Dexedrine,"Dextroamphetamine is the prodrug to Vyvanse meaning Vyvanse is metabolized into dexedrine after you take it. 

I was on Vyvanse for awhile and loved it but then my insurance stopped covering it. I switched to dextroamphetamine and I think it works just as well"

Vyvanse or Dexedrine,"It should be similar to Adderall.  Adderall is mostly Dexedrine with some I-amph as well.  Iirc it's 3:1 ratio of the two.

Edit: This was misleading.  See the below comment."
Vyvanse or Dexedrine,"Yeah. I feel like you just explained how I feel. I was diagnosed very young and have been on Ritalin, adderall and I think concerta as various points in my life. I am also hyperactive and I get so drowsy and sleepy, if I take my adderall I feel like I need a nap everyday. So I’m nervous if Dexedrine is going to be more of the same like adderall because I genuinely don’t think it is for me. I am on Wellbutrin which has helped but I need just a bit more so I’ve been working psychiatrist to find a good combo but I can’t get her to let me try Vyvanse. It’s infuriating."
Vyvanse or Dexedrine,"This is incorrect. Dexedrine and Vyvanse are actually the same drug (Vyvanse is a pro-drug of Dexedrine’s active ingredient), but the additional amphetamine in Adderall increases mental stimulation/side effects. That’s why Adderall can be great for many inattentive people but cause serious anxiety in hyperactive people, and why some inattentive people don’t feel that Vyvanse/Dexedrine do anything for them but they calm hyperactive people down."
Vyvanse or Dexedrine,"Dexedrine and Adderall felt like opposites to me, so it might be worth looking into at a small dose. My doctor gave me the lowest dose in a pill that can be cut in half and I had Xanax in case I had a bad reaction (I have PTSD so stimulants aren’t recommended until everything else has been tried). 

It doesn’t make a ton of sense that your doctor would refuse to let you try the least addictive medication, but the generic should be released next year and the price will go down."
Vyvanse or Dexedrine,Oh fascinating.  Thanks for clearing that up!
Vyvanse or Dexedrine,"This was very helpful, and leads me to believe I may need to switch. I’ve been on vyvanse for 4 days now and all I feel is an increased heart rate and harder pounding in my chest (like the rate and intensity are both higher?) but no help to my inattention. I wonder if adderall would be more helpful mentally? I’ve been online all day trying to figure out what might help."
Vyvanse or Dexedrine,"A small does of what? Right now I’m on 300 Wellbutrin and then 10mg extended release of adderall which I think is the smallest amount I’ve ever been on. I was on 10 in the morning and 10 in the after noon immediate release before this. But I wasn’t actually focusing on anything productive, I felt anxious and then would crash. I don’t think the 10xl I am on now is helping and I don’t think it ever has helped that much either, I’m not doing what I need to and still crashing. I just haven’t been a really good advocate for myself especially as a teenager and I’m not sure what options there were outside of adderall and Ritalin growing up. Now I’m learning there’s so many medications/ combinations that I’m determined to find what works for me but I feel like my psychiatrist isn’t open to my ideas I guess. 

Sorry if that’s a lot or doesn’t make sense!"
Vyvanse or Dexedrine,"No problem! I’m fortunate that I have access to research, because this isn’t openly talked about. I actually had to explain it to my doctor after I had a bad reaction to an Adderall booster and she wanted to mix Ritalin and my Vyvanse."
Vyvanse or Dexedrine,"It takes longer than that to notice the benefits of Vyvanse, so you’ll definitely want to keep in touch with your doctor. Normally they try to give it about 2 weeks before they switch things around. It’s designed to be a subtle feeling that helps long term rather than short bursts of feeling something intense to help prevent abuse/addiction/misuse. 

Ritalin is also another great option for people who aren’t helped by Vyvanse. That was what my doctor had as a second choice before we knew I was hyperactive. So a conversation with your doctor is definitely the way to go. I know it’s easy to try to research it on our own, but the information out there isn’t always super accurate. I have access to medical journals because I’m a PhD student, so I pull from different sources than most."
Vyvanse or Dexedrine,"A small amount of another medication, since it seems that the Adderall is not giving you the relief you’re looking for. 

While advocacy is important, it isn’t your job to go into the doctors’ offices knowing what medications you need. Your responsibility is to bring in the list of how the medication is helping, what it’s not helping, and the side effects that bother you. This sub creates an impression that we should walk in and tell them what we need, which creates a lot of anxiety surrounding the appointments. Your doctor should be willing to stop and have conversations with you where you are presented options moving forward that you choose together. Your other responsibility as an adult patient is to participate in those conversations or find a doctor that helps you feel comfortable/trust them enough to do so."
Vyvanse or Dexedrine,"May I ask a question you may know about?  I believe I'm combined type.  My Adderall XR only seems to add to my hyperfocus so I can get boring stuff at work done, but it's done nothing for my executive function.  I have an upcoming psych appointment anyways, but do you think there's any med specifically I should try to target switching to or adding?"
Vyvanse or Dexedrine,Yeah I’m curious about all this too.. like what effects what as far as executive function and working memory and stuff like that. I was diagnosed really young some time ago and now I kind of want to get one of those full diagnostic tests that shows how your brain works in these areas cause I know nothing.
Vyvanse or Dexedrine,"I don’t mind answering since you have an appointment, but I’d recommend speaking to your therapist about this as well because it’s an important topic to work through with your support team. 

Generally speaking, stimulants are supposed to increase cognitive function which can result in a higher amount of “focus” over time. If you’re getting intense focus but your overall cognitive function isn’t getting better or is getting worse, then the medications aren’t technically working as designed. Not all doctors care because we live in a society that focuses on productivity, but if the medication is right for you, you should be seeing an overall increase in your quality of life. 

Boring tasks are difficult for everyone to manage, so it’s best to explore your motivation styles, routines, and evaluate your work/school situations and create a more holistic plan that includes your medications. I explained my interpretation of how ADHD medications influence “focus” (not a word I use professionally or personally) and cognition in my comment on this post which might help too. 

ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder not a psychiatric condition, so there’s a lot of misunderstandings about the purpose and uses of medications when they’re prescribed by general doctors or those who don’t have a strong background in cognitive disorders."
Vyvanse or Dexedrine,"Thanks for the explanation!  This makes sense, and explains why I felt like my current meds aren't working as intended.  I definitely didn't feel like the intent was to just improve my ability to focus, but overall function like you stated.  If that was how they were described, I wouldn't have bothered lol.  I definitely feel like I've been making less mistakes at work lately and stuff, but not to a massively noticeable extent.  No one else has commented on it.

Thanks for the advice!  I'm also currently in therapy working on ADHD and procrastination.  It's so hard because I only recently started taking my mental health seriously.  It was sort of brushed off in childhood and now I'm stuck with the baggage of not knowing how to cope.  Ah well.

It's also difficult because I think I have some anxiety and depression issues that may be clouding the effectiveness of the meds."
Vyvanse or Dexedrine,"Increases in cognition generally help with reducing anxiety and depression, so finding the right medication might help those as well. They did for me, including my treatment resistant PTSD. 

Adderall isn’t the only stimulant medication, so trying out Vyvanse/Dexedrine or Ritalin might be a good thing to explore with your doctor."
Vyvanse or Dexedrine,"Oh yeah, I was only on 11mg, but I didn't feel anything at all from concerta except insomnia.  So I might see if I can try Vyvanse/Dexedrine.  Thanks for all the advice.  I feel like things are way more clear now."

Apparently Dexedrine ir is not approved/recommended for adhd??,Thats wild. In canada its one of the few covered adhd meds
Apparently Dexedrine ir is not approved/recommended for adhd??,Hhhmm yeah i dont trust this nurse. She rly pushed on vyvanse
Apparently Dexedrine ir is not approved/recommended for adhd??,"Your gp is 100% right, you plans nurse has no idea what she’s talking about. She’s a nurse, who saying bullshit.

Also, doctors and practices get paid by pharmaceutical companies to rep vyvanse, as it’s extremely expensive. It also presents tons of challenges IR meds do not, and is not superior, nor does it work for everyone’s lifestyle.

As others have explained, the difference between lisdex and dex is mainly irrelevant if you’re not snorting it, except its many drawbacks."

Dexedrine vs Concerta vs Vyvanse,"Concerta imo just made me really high and confused 

Vyvanse is my personal favorite ADHD med

Trialling Dexedrine…,"And you have no prior experience with amphetamines? That’s honestly pretty bizarre. 25mg should be more than noticeable for anyone who hasn’t built a tolerance, LOL. Some piece of the puzzle is missing here."
Trialling Dexedrine…,"You have taken 25 mg at once and don't feel it? Sure you aren't washing these pills down with OJ? 

Seriously, though. Are you giving the pills a chance to kick in or are you just taking them 10 minutes apart?"
Trialling Dexedrine…,"Never any amphetamines. I am on a few antidepressants and my psychiatrist made a comment about “maybe all the receptors are covered”. Then she said, “I guess I’ll just give you a bunch of Ritalin and see what happens”. I decided I’m looking for a new psychiatrist."
Trialling Dexedrine…,"My understanding was that she wanted me to take all 5 at the same time. Started with half one day, next day took one, etc. yesterday I took 5. Maybe that’s part of the problem? 

On another note, I didn’t know about not taking with acid/ vit c. Luckily I haven’t been but good to know for the future."
Trialling Dexedrine…,"That’s probably the best course of action, yeah. I’d suspect either the antidepressants or perhaps an endocrine issue. To answer your original question, the first dose of an amphetamine I ever took was 20mg Adderall and I immediately dropped down to 10 for my next dose, because it was way too potent (I want to function better, not get high). Dexedrine is somewhat more potent than adderall, for most people, mg-for-mg…I’d expect you to be stuck to the ceiling at that dose and with no prior experience."
Trialling Dexedrine…,"You sure you have all of your other ducks in a row? Sleep, Nutrition, that kinda stuff?"
Trialling Dexedrine…,"I don’t have the ducks, let alone in a row. Im struggling to function and hoping something would help kick start me into some action… it’s a nasty cycle."
Is 70mg (per day) of methylphenidate IR a lot? And would dextroamfetamine (dexedrine - amfexa) be better at controlling it at lower doses with less side effects?,"How much someone might need really depends on nutrition, weight, height, severity of adhd etc. But yes, 70mg is IR is a preytt high dose. The maximum recommended daily dose for ritalin IR is 60mg for adults. Off-label dose is up to 100mg per day. 

I found this stimulant calculator online:

Maybe a medication break and a lower dose could help you?

How hi did you start on XR? Could it have been too high in the first place? 

Through HS and into my mid 20s I took a 10 mg XR at breakfast and another at lunch and that didn’t affect my appetite and seemed to allow me to focus.

Off-label dosing can get higher here in the UK, I believe. But if it gets any higher than 90mg, I might just ask for dexamfetamine sulfate, or amfexa IR, and if I gain tolerances to that just take breaks for 7 days every now and then and stay on 60mg max a day of that. Don't wanna go any higher on dexamfetamine/or dexamphetamine (in US terms).

To substitute the energy and euphoria received from the combination of d-amphetamine a l- amphetamine found in adderall, I drink a lot of C4 pre-workout and run until I feel happy.

New on dexedrine,"When I started methylphenidate (also a stimulant) I felt like that in the evenings for about 1 - 2 weeks, never had any issues since. Hope all goes ok for you."
New on dexedrine,"I had this happen with other meds not Dexedrine though, it’s a common side effect for a lot of people to most stimulants though. Give it a week or two though for your body to adjust and if it’s still an issue, and it bothers you that much consider changing your med. If it doesn’t then you just learn to work around it. 

Also take into account, a lot of people, not all of them feel an emotional low when their stimulant wears off, it’s pretty common tbh. Depends on the person and med though. If it’s a still thing after a week or two and it bothers you that much bring up with your psychiatrist switching meds."
New on dexedrine,"It would be a good idea to reach out to your prescriber and let them know.  We aren't doctors, can't give out medical advice, etc.  I can say there is a tendency with adhd medication to have a period when the medication is wearing off (usually at the end of the day) when symptoms come back at a higher-than-usual level for a bit.  I don't know if this is true for Dexedrine specifically, though."
New on dexedrine,"Do you find you are more anxious and depressed in the evenings than you were before taking the medicine?

Unless you are taking a dose late in the evening it's likely your comedown will start around 8pm, and it's not meant to cause drastic problems, but what it will do is stop helping with the ADHD.

I find by the time my dex has worn out my mind will start spiraling again and I will often end up overthinking situations and resuming my anxious tendencies.

However I believe I was always doing this, just throughout the day instead of all at night.

It's very important to distinguish the ""contrast"" from the actual impact the meds have on you, especially if you're noticing these things as they fall off / stop  working."
New on dexedrine,"Other guy who's said reach out has the right idea. 

But too try an awnser the question, I did not feel that at all taking ritalin which is SOMEWHAT similar. But still different, but I would say that if you feel that way, you should find a solution.

The way my meds make me feel is simply, like I can use my brain, and that's comfortable and not super stressful. Now it is a bit stressful that I've been numbing out my emotions and now they are all flooding back in, but I would think you'd already know that if that's the issue, if not though I ain't judging.

Struggling during switch from vyvanse to Dexedrine?,"First of all I’m sorry you’re dealing with this. The insurance situation in the US is ridiculous. Have you checked healthcare.gov to see if you qualify for any free or subsidized health insurance plans?

If you switched because the Vyvanse is too expensive without insurance then can you maybe look into trying Ritalin or generic Adderall? The generic extended release Adderall can get a bit pricey without insurance but the immediate release taken twice a day should be a pretty reasonable price. I take both: generic Adderall XR in the morning and generic Adderall IR in the afternoon. I pay out of pocket because insurance wanted more paperwork to prove I have ADHD and I never got around to sending it in. (Which should honestly be proof enough but whatever…) I usually pay $53/month for the XR and $13/month for the IR. I think generic Ritalin is even more affordable."
Struggling during switch from vyvanse to Dexedrine?,"Why don't you try taking Dexedrine IR twice a day, instead of Dexedrine ER? The extended release version can sometimes produce inconsistent results, but I always feel stable on instant release twice a day."
Struggling during switch from vyvanse to Dexedrine?,"I’m actually in Canada and paid ~$820 CAD (~$600 USD) for my last 3 month of vyvanse (prescriptions aren’t included in Canadian universal healthcare, and thus fall into the realm of private insurance). 

The province I live in has a government subsidized pharmacare program that I qualify for, however they will not cover vyvanse unless your doctor writes a letter substantiating the need specifically for vyvanse over other cheaper medications. I could maybe ask about adderall, however IIrc, the IR adderall isn’t available in Canada, and XR adderall is generally less common here than in the US. Maybe if I’m lucky and other generics end up sucking just as much, I could end up having my doctor just write the letter to get subsidized vyvanse."
Struggling during switch from vyvanse to Dexedrine?,"Out of curiosity, what IR doses are you taking? Did you ever find that IR doses that are big enough to last you half a day end up feeling a bit too intense?"
Struggling during switch from vyvanse to Dexedrine?,I take 20 mg twice a day. Each dose lasts about 5 hours. But I started at a lower dose and gradually worked my way up. I've been stable at this dose for over 10 years.
Son on vyvanse and looks skeletal.😥 Would Dexedrine be easier on the appetite??,"Honestly with the struggles I had after first starting meds I'm not surprised a 16 y/o would do worse. Have you considered stopping meds until he's eating and gaining weight? Doing well in school isn't really worth it if he's potentially stunting his growth.

I will also say I'd be very careful since one can develop an ED at that age easily. My younger sister developed one she still struggles with in adulthood after losing weight due to an unrelated illness at 15. Having people comment on your smaller weight (my family never treated it like a good thing but I'm sure she heard comments at school) while you're still a self conscious teen can stick with you for a long time."
Son on vyvanse and looks skeletal.😥 Would Dexedrine be easier on the appetite??,"Maybe you can try to make really high calories meals for him ? So even with a small portion he will have what je need (at least in term of ""energie"")."
Son on vyvanse and looks skeletal.😥 Would Dexedrine be easier on the appetite??,"Emphasize a high calorie meal before his dosage, one with protein and fats. Should be like 800 calories at least. A similar meal (maybe a bit lighter depending) should occur at his wind-down period.

While its active, if he's anything like me, it's not like eating is impossible, it's just that you have no appetite and no prompt or desire to eat. The idea of a heavy meal is also repulsive.

He needs to be prompted to eat at periodic intervals of the day (either timed reminders on his phone, or you can bring food to him, the latter is ideal if possible). 

Keep it low in volume and high in nutrient density. Think PB&J with a tall glass of milk, a quick burger or wrap, a medium-size plate of pasta, a protein blended shake, etc. Be generous with liquid calories too, they'll be the easiest. Snacks too like chips, nuts, cookies and muffins. The food being super healthy is less of a priority depending on how serious the problem is.

I also personally don't take it everyday. I would prioritize days with the med as ""study days"" and grind a ton of work, and I'd try to emphasize sleep and proper eating on the off-days. Hope it helps."
Son on vyvanse and looks skeletal.😥 Would Dexedrine be easier on the appetite??,"It may help to change meds but i actually eat more on Adderall. Does he like ice cream?  Try some fancy ice cream with real sugar instead of corn syrup.  A few weeks of all u can eat ice cream may help stretch out his stomach. After not eating much for a while his stomach may be too small to hold much food. You could put muscle milk into chocolate shakes. Get creative with junk food. Try to get him accustomed to enjoy eating whatever tastes good.  Then work your way into healthier food. Be sure to make it fun or a reward.

Son on vyvanse and looks skeletal.😥 Would Dexedrine be easier on the appetite??,A lot of stimulants decrease appetite. Why don't you help him cook things and make sure he eats 3 times a day? Maybe you could look into meal prepping. That's what I'm doing.

When I take my meds I def have a shift in appetite but will eat, his is like will not eat for hours and hours and when he does extremely small portions.  Very different from before Vyvanse. All meds makde him jot as hungry but now he literally hasn't gained any weigh and lost weight in over 6 mths. Thxs for any help."
Son on vyvanse and looks skeletal.😥 Would Dexedrine be easier on the appetite??,Thanks. Not sure what to do. Vyvanse has def without a doubt affected his appetite more than any other medicine. Night and day difference and he tells me he is just not as into eating which is what worries me. Don't want to develop food issues down the road. That is why Inwas wondering about Dex bc similar medicine. I didn't give him meds yesterday and he ate so much. I have also done wknd breaks to see if.he can catch up. Going to give this week on lower dosage a go and see what happens. He looks so very thin.😥
Son on vyvanse and looks skeletal.😥 Would Dexedrine be easier on the appetite??,Hi there thanks for the reply. Update if the appetite stimulant works. 🙂
Son on vyvanse and looks skeletal.😥 Would Dexedrine be easier on the appetite??,"Hi, did the appetite med work, and if so what did they prescribe?"
Son on vyvanse and looks skeletal.😥 Would Dexedrine be easier on the appetite??,"Does he eat before he takes it? A big morning meal might be helpful. Also if meals are small adding more of them. And then putting food out. Also drinks can be high calorie, juice, milk, chocolate milk. Smoothies with coconut oil and cream.(2 handfuls fruit, oj, a Noosa Greek yogurt, 2 tbs heavy cream, 1 TBS coconut oil). Ive also put the same thing in an ice cream maker lol. My am coffee is always a latte, its not healthy but it is 340 ish calories.

The problem imo with drugs and heavy food is that they feel heavy. See sneaky smoothy above. 

Granola is high calorie, and nuts. Put them on the counter! In line of sight, or on the desk. Grapes are high calorie. Potatoes. Personally cheese is like my weakness. So maybe cheesesticks and cheese and crackers. Also I highly recommend sour cream (obviously don't eat it by itself but if you had a taco, with sour cream the sour cream would be 1/3 of the calories lol) 

Cheesy steak fries! Nachos!

Also. I put all my food in a small plate with small utensils because that makes your brain think food is bigger(go the other way!) 

And then add mindless snack. Popcorn, chips. Theres 2 choices. The recommendation is to put food in a bowl, so you know a portion. That may help, or just handing him a bag may be better.

Questions about Dexedrine formulations that I can't seem to find a straight answer for,"*TL;DR: None. Dexedrine Spansule/generic (40% IR + 60% SR) and Adderall XR/generic (50% IR + 50% DR) have different release mechanisms. For Dexedrine Spansule/generic, 40% of the capsule contains uncoated pellets released immediately; the remaining pellets have applied varying amounts of coating (approx. 3 different amounts) so that the amount of active dextroamphetamine sulfate in the body is released steadily over time, maintaining a relatively constant level of the active ingredient within the body until it is fully utilized.* 

In long:

Effectively, neither brand name Dexedrine Spansule nor its generic, dextroamphetamine sulfate extended release, uses the same release mechanism as Adderall XR / its generic form. 

You correctly mention above that Adderall XR has a biphasic, or 50/50 release mechanism; half of its active ingredients are released immediately (IR) after ingesting the capsule, while the other half are released approximately 4 hours later. This second release of the remaining half of the pellets is known as “DR” (delayed release…i.e., a second IR dose). 

Dexedrine and generic dextroamphetamine sulfate extended release, however, all share purportedly “sustained release” mechanisms. 

Interestingly, the label of my brand-name prescription bottle reads “Dexedrine Cr 24H” At best, my sense is that “sustained” and “controlled” in this context are used interchangeably. 

The verbiage used in each of the medication guides for the three Dexedrine/generic players in the market (Amneal Specialty, labeler for name brand Dexedrine Spansule, as well as generic dextroamphetamine sulfate extended release manufacturers Actavis and Mallinckrodt), is “more or less” reflected verbatim.

*[Dexedrine & its generics] are purported to be sustained-release capsules “so prepared that an initial dose is released promptly and the remaining medication is released gradually over a prolonged period.”*

In reviewing the original (1950s) patent when Spansule technology was initially introduced, along with cross-checking with the most recent guide concerning ADHD treatment (from Health Canada; but, note that the brand name Dexedrine Spansule in the US and in Canada is the same formulation), 40% of the active ingredient is released immediately from the (uncoated) pellets inside each capsule, with the remaining 60% of the active ingredient releasing consistently at different points in time from the remaining (coated) pellets, whose dimensions vary, thereby enabling a controlled, sustaining release of the active ingredient."

High BPM on Adderall switch to Dexedrine?,"That baseline BPM increase is just plain going to happen with Adderall. There's not much you can do except stop taking it and search for another solution. Have you looked into guanfacine as alternative medication? If not, check it out."
High BPM on Adderall switch to Dexedrine?,"I don't know about blood pressure, but when I switched from Adderall to Dexedrine, I felt much calmer and my hands stopped shaking. When I was on Adderall, I was irritable and jumpy, so I'm sure my blood pressure was higher than normal. The levoamphetamine has that effect on some people."
High BPM on Adderall switch to Dexedrine?,"Is your hr 60 during actual rest (e.g. sleep) or during something like office work? 

A jump from 60 to 100 is somewhat severe, even for Adderall. I guess no harm in trying dextroamphetamine."

Dexedrine no appetite until midnight,"well obviously you need to force yourself to eat. eat food you find yummy, and eat it with fruits or veggies to make it a healthy meal. when we're on meds we're burning TONS of calories so we need to eat lots of fat and protein to compensate. if you just can't get yourself to eat then you'll need to lower your dose or take days off so your body can recover, otherwise you'll learn the hard way what burnout is like.

"PSA: Be wary of switching to similar medications for ADHD. 20mg of Vyvanse vs. 20mg of Adderall or 20mg of Dexedrine are not even remotely close, and your doctor probably isn't aware!","It's not uncommon to have adverse reactions to medications which don't involve the workings of the medication at all, and which cannot be reproduced in repeat trials.

The problem with shrugging off free-base equivalency is that at the end of the day both of these medications turn into the exact same psychoactive substance in your blood, and we have peer-reviewed, adequate-sample, inductively-demonstrated evidence of the exact ratio to which this occurs.

It's also possible that your gastric or urinary pH was extremely high while on Dexedrine, as pH does not affect Vyvanse metabolisation but does affect the metabolisation amount per period of Dexedrine subtractively. 

So with a high pH, the drug itself takes longer to absorp and the pharmacokinetic curve is flattened, taking away the ""strongness"" of the substance and distributing it more conservatively over time.

This would be to the best of my knowledge the only other factor at play here that isn't purely psychological."

"Tips on maintaining or gaining weight while on Dexedrine, Adderall, or any other amphetamines?","Add more calorie dense toppings or sauces to meals. Also smoothies can be calorie dense but it doesn't make you feel full as actually chewing the same foods. Keep snacks around for days you skip lunch, it takes 30 seconds to eat a protein bar something. Or deliberately have a snack on your commute home.
Avocado on salad and sandwiches 
Add pecans/peanut butter and granola to oatmeal
Do alfredo sauce with pasta instead of a tomato sauce
Add creamer to coffee if you drink it black

Anything chefs do in restaurants to make food better works too.

Also it may be worth it to try a slightly lower dose if your meds can be divided. Maybe try that on a day off or a slower day at work."
"Tips on maintaining or gaining weight while on Dexedrine, Adderall, or any other amphetamines?","I mean do you eat before your medication ? if you do and you're having enough calories, then definitely you should bring it up with your doctor because it sounds like your medication is maybe not even diminishing fat but also muscle definitely something to bring up"

"Tips on maintaining or gaining weight while on Dexedrine, Adderall, or any other amphetamines?","I take it twice a day, once in the morning, once in the afternoon. I usually eat right after, I don't always have a microwave and get pretty caught up in work so don't always eat lunch. Dexedrine definitely supresses my appetite, so that's where my issue comes in here."
"Tips on maintaining or gaining weight while on Dexedrine, Adderall, or any other amphetamines?",It's just that they season/salt more liberally and use more oil. Both enhance the flavor of food which just encourages you to have more. Like it would be weird to eat 5 cold cheese sticks unless you fry them and put marinara on the side. Same concept.
"Tips on maintaining or gaining weight while on Dexedrine, Adderall, or any other amphetamines?","I have the same appetite issues. I snack a lot during the day but I have a desk job so that might not work as well for you. 

I find the biggest issue is that the lack of appetite causes me to just never eat lunch- having no appetite means that I don’t have the motivation to step away from work for it. I think you need to start forcing yourself to do it- try to create some kind of routine. Maybe look into stuff like meal replacement drinks that are quick to eat and you don’t have to worry about a microwave etc."
"Tips on maintaining or gaining weight while on Dexedrine, Adderall, or any other amphetamines?","Yes! That's exactly it, no appetite, no motivation to stop working.

Adderall vs. Dexedrine,"The research says straight dex is actually better than Adderall. Adderall is 75% dex and 25% levoamphetamine.  
  
The levo is a stronger CNS stimulant which give it more of a physical 'feel', than pure dex. So people can 'feel their meds working'  
  
In all the research, there were no larger decreases in ADHD symptoms for Adderall over dex. However the trade off for the 'feel' from the levo, is that it will have stronger side effects.  
  
So essentially pure dex will treat your ADHD just as well, and will have slightly less side effects, but you won't 'feel' your medication, so you may find yourself thinking your meds 'aren't working' even though they are.

That said 15mg pure dex is roughly 18mg Adderall effect wise. (Consider 40mg Adderall is 30mg Dex and 10mg Levo)"

Vyvanse and Dexedrine Spansule,Probably he clicked the er instead of ir. Tell the pharmacy they should be able to sort it out for you. They'll have to wait on the doc to respond though so It might be a few days
Vyvanse and Dexedrine Spansule,"Thank you!

I went ahead and emailed my doc to see if it was accidental. My pharmacy is Walgreens, and they were rude when I asked about the Dexedrine ER being back ordered this morning.😅. So I figured I’d cut out the middle man for this one."
Vyvanse and Dexedrine Spansule,They can fax your doc though and get a faster response. I'm a pharmacy tech btw. Right now things are backordered alot with stimulants so they probably had 20 other people ask within the hour and were annoyed. Id call them and explain that you think your doc mistakenly put in for er.
Vyvanse and Dexedrine Spansule,"That is great to know! I always get confused bc I’ve had another pharmacy (CVS) tell me I’d need to reach out myself to my doctor for other issues I’ve had. 
However, my doc actually replied immediately and he said it was intentional and explained how the release works, in what amounts, for how long etc. We will see how this goes, if it ever makes it to the pharmacy. I was advised to call after they get their shipment on Monday, so fingers crossed 🤞🏻"

I know I’m not making this up because a while back, my pharmacy ran out of Teva and told me all they had was a small amount of pills from an old batch of KVK-tech Dexedrine, which they had leftover from who knows how long ago. I agreed to get those because there was no other option, and to my surprise, the old KVK-tech Dexedrine pills felt VERY strong and worked very well in comparison to the Teva’s, which don’t work at all.

So it's 60mg Vyvanse.

BUT

Dexamphetamine can vary a fair bit as far as abosption goes, both day to day and person to person.

Vyvanse however is absorbed almost perfectly by everyone. So while technically equivalent to 60mg there is a very strong chance you'd find it way too much. I'd be inclined to try something like 40mg first."

Switching from Vyvanse to Dexedrine Long Release? Expereince?,"So Vyvanse is a prodrug meaning that it comes in an inactive form, enzymes in your gut are needed to break it down. Dexedrine comes in it’s active form so it can start working right away. Potentially your gut enzymes might be doing a poor job of cleaving the l-lysine from the dextroamphetamine. 

If you are a slow metabolizer, you will need a lower dose of drugs in their active form because your body clears the drug from your bloodstream at a slower than average rate. This means that the drug can reach a higher blood concentration more easily. 

If you are a slow metabolizer and are taking a drug in its inactive form you actually need a higher dose of the drug. This is because you are slower to convert the drug to its active form so you could fail to reach a high enough blood concentration before the drug is cleared from your system. The inverse is true of a rapid metabolizer. 

Your ability to metabolize drugs is influenced by variations in the CYP2B6, CYP2D6, ADRA2A, COMT genes.  You can look those up if you’re interested in learning more about pharmacogenomics"
Switching from Vyvanse to Dexedrine Long Release? Expereince?,"i switched fully just recently too, but im on 15mg of the long acting bc vyvanse was my med for 8 years... we were just taking a break from it to make it last longer... but i feel better? 

it doesn't have that Crash when it fades out of my system. i don't have to adapt every single night to a mindset that feels inherently worse, and i don't lose 2 hours to being kinda braindead.

tbh im starting to wonder if it's just overhyped by the pharmaceutical company to justify 300 a bottle when i only had Medicare. Dexedrine works similarly, so?

in retrospect i felt like a slave on vyvanse, couldn't function without it and had to pay 10 dollars a day just to be able to. i never learned Dexedrine existed before seeing someone on this sub talk about it last year. so. :')

""you can't get addicted to vyvanse like other medication!""  what's the difference between a potential substance addiction and a mandatory prescription medication?"

Switching from Vyvanse to Dexedrine Long Release? Expereince?,"What you are experience is a mild high. They are the same thing, and metabolism doesn't work like that. Lisdexamphetamine is metabolized to dexamphetamine via enzymatic cleavage which varies little person to person. It slows the delivery as you would know.

5mg IR Dex is the equivalent to 16.3mg Vyvanse, plus what you have left in your system from Vyvanse, which would still be over half of it.

&#x200B;

This is euphoria from the high from the sudden surge in dexamphetamine. Longer term meds provide a little focus, and very little motivation. You will find this will fade over the coming weeks I'm afraid."

Switching from Vyvanse to Dexedrine Long Release? Expereince?,I am going to get hyper fixated on this lol thank you!! I'll bring up metabolism with my doctor as well.
Switching from Vyvanse to Dexedrine Long Release? Expereince?,"Hey, this is really interesting since I was considering starting Dex as well

Currently on 50mg Vyvanse and I've gotten it to where it works pretty well for the first 5 hours, and then starts tapering off into decent attention for another hour or two, then nothing

However, to achieve this and to get the full effect of my dose, I have to have a full stomach; it seems like my body physically stops cleaving the lysine when I don't have enough calories in my system, so I get several dips in attention/motor function during the day until I eat something again (high-calorie yogurt weirdly works the best and 350 cal. lasts me a little more than an hour)

Having a fast digestive metabolism doesn't help with this either; by the time the active d-amp concentration climbs to the level it's supposed to be at, I usually need food again

This is making it necessary for me to get the maintenance calories that my body needs (I wasn't eating nearly this much before) but it's a pain in the ass to have ups and downs during the day solely based on calories/protein in my system

Should I increase my Vyvanse dose or just switch to Dex ER?"
Switching from Vyvanse to Dexedrine Long Release? Expereince?,"hey there, currently on dexedrine and i’m having really bad crashes (first time on stimulants) did you ever experience this when you first started? thanks"
Switching from Vyvanse to Dexedrine Long Release? Expereince?,"Yeah, I'll talk to my doctor about it and give it a go if he agrees."
Switching from Vyvanse to Dexedrine Long Release? Expereince?,"I disagree. A high is an emotional experience. Motivation and the ability to start difficult but necessary tasks are just basic functions and are what the meds are supposed to help with. Dex sulfate helped me with that the whole time I took it, the effect didn’t wear off"
Switching from Vyvanse to Dexedrine Long Release? Expereince?,"it's been forever since i first started so idk, but it's probably something that will go away when your mind knows whats happening, mmm. people had a better time starting on vyvanse iirc so thats something to consider imo"
Switching from Vyvanse to Dexedrine Long Release? Expereince?,"I experienced some minor crashes when I first started taking Vyvanse. The crashes would mainly be irritability and low mood levels, but it wasn’t bad for me. About 2-3 weeks in, I stopped getting those crushes but instead, when the meds start wearing off, I feel sad, mainly cause all my ADD symptoms start showing (blanking out, forgetting, etc.). 

As for when I first started Dexedrine, I only experienced a slight headache the first time I took it. Ever since, I've had no other side effects or crashes."
Switching from Vyvanse to Dexedrine Long Release? Expereince?,"You’ve given me hope, thank you! I'm currently doing university units that I genuinely enjoy, yet I still struggle to start and focus on Vyvanse (I feel like I have good days and bad days on it). Dexedrine, on the other hand, I would start without a second thought, and I wouldn't get distracted either."
Switching from Vyvanse to Dexedrine Long Release? Expereince?,"I just switched from dex to vyvanse (opposite of you) and I’ve been struggling to get any uni work done all week. I’m hoping the dose is just too low, because if this keeps going on I’ll have to go back to dex. Which mentally the dex was all I hoped for but I kept forgetting to take my midday doses"
Switching from Vyvanse to Dexedrine Long Release? Expereince?,"If you don't mind me asking, what dose are you taking?

I've heard of people being on much higher doses, so it's definitely a possibility.

I started on 30mg and found it to be somewhat effective, and it didn't last long for me. Eventually, I made my way to 50mg and saw some changes, I was able to focus more, and it lasted a bit longer. The only problem I had with going to 50mg was I became very jittery and I had too many days where my anxiety was controlling me (I already suffered from anxiety prior to starting my ADHD journey)."
Switching from Vyvanse to Dexedrine Long Release? Expereince?,"I’ve started on 30. It’s not doing much for my focus and executive function, but I seem to be really restless and keep getting super emotional every afternoon- not sure what that’s about
Edit: my other problem with both dex and vyvanse is my stomach doesn’t like them. Stomach upsets every day."
Switching from Vyvanse to Dexedrine Long Release? Expereince?,"When I first started, I felt like Vyvanse made me feel very anxious. I heard that Vyvanse triggers your fight or flight response (I read it from somewhere but not sure it's 100% correct), but this did ease for me after taking them regularly over time. Getting super emotional might be the crash. I get easily agitated when the meds start wearing off, but I've learned to control it. Dex I've been okay with but Vyvanse would always lead to a trip to the toilet when it first starts kicking in but that's gone as well.

Talk to your doctor about all the symptoms, but these are some tips I have:

Make sure you're eating well cause the upset stomach could be due to hunger that ADHD meds tend to cover up.

If you notice you go to the toilet due to an upset stomach, drink water cause it'll dehydrate you.

And lastly, make sure if you struggle with any side effects (for Vyvanse) when it starts kicking in, try to take it like an hour or two before you wake up. It's a bit of a pain, but I found waking up to take the meds, going back to sleep and then waking at your normal time helped me a lot. I would wake up without any anxiety or side effects (other than appetite loss)."
Switching from Vyvanse to Dexedrine Long Release? Expereince?,Thanks so much for that advice. I’ll try your tips. If it doesn’t improve I’ll probably just ask to go back on Dex

I take it at night and the long half life elevates my anxiety the next day and helps me to sleep better. I really notice if I don’t take it, dex just gives me anxiety and my psych isn’t a fan of ritalin but i might ask her about it. i’ve been on dex for 5 months, clons for 4 months. also tried modafinil but it fried my brain and wasn’t very effective past day 1."

dexamphetamine/dexedrine + clonazepam/klonopin combo,"the benzo was prescribed for the week before my menstrual cycle when my anxiety is really bad. i had covid recently which also increased my overall anxiety…it just clicked that i am due for my period to begin any day so no wonder the anxiety which i feel like i have all the time when i’m experiencing it. I’ll keep track of the next month and my anxiety on dex, might have a week off and start with a lower dose. I’ll give it another month and if no improvement in the anxiety i’ll ask my psych about bupropion and atomoxetine. thanks for your help!"

"Experiences with Intuniv (Guanfacine) or Kapvay (Clonidine) adjunct to Amphetamine stimulant medications (Adderall, Dexedrine, Vyvanse)?","I’ve been prescribed both Clonidine and Intuniv for my ADHD. I tried clonidine first and because it’s traditionally a blood pressure medication, it ended up making me feel super lightheaded and dizzy, so we switched to Intuniv. It has made a world of difference in my day-to-day life. I’m also on Wellbutrin, which helps manage my motivation and drive as well as depression. The Intuniv seems to help everything else. My focus has greatly improved, my memory retrieval is so much quicker, my impulsivity and irritability from overstimulation have been kept at bay.

I was just prescribed Clonidine .1mg ER alongside my existing prescription for Adderall 15mg ER.

Psych nurse and gp contradicting each other on dexedrine ir vs vyvanse,"It feels like any adhd med that is right for you. When that was my right dose I was calm/relaxed, tuned down anxiety, random infinite thoughts. My mind was quiet, i remember details, stay on track with tasks and time. I wasn’t rushed, planned better, my mood was better. If i wanted to do smt i could just do it instead of dreading and avoiding. Little things weren’t frustrating, i was more rational, managed problems and emotions better, wasn’t looking for smt to do constantly, wasn’t bored 24/7. I was more social and confident, had more energy and motivation.
I cried the first time i took it bc i never felt such peace before. It was like me but better.
Side effects: dry skin/mouth, appetite loss. When it hit and was getting used to it I’d have heart palpitations, chest tightness, slight tremor, restlessnesses but physical. The crashes in the beginning made me drowsy, irritated, hungry."

I have never heard any qualified medical professional say that Dexedrine has \*more\* side effects than other stimulants, or amphetamines in general.

"If you felt extremely tired by Dexedrine, what medication did you try next?","i felt that too when i tried it a couple years ago tbh :') focalin 30mg works well enough for me now!

edit: havent taken meds yet, so i can elaborate on anything if you give me like half an hour lmao"
"If you felt extremely tired by Dexedrine, what medication did you try next?","It can be that your dosage was too low or that the drug just wasn't for you. Constant tiredness is definitely not how things are supposed to be. In my experience it's unlikely that a lower dose would increase the drug's effectiveness in such a situation. A far as I know, lowering the dosage is only relevant if you are feeling overly stimulated or there are other side effects.

One note right off the bat - it's important to not take vitamin C such as fruit juices around the same time you take your Dexedrine or other stimulants, since that can greatly reduce their effectiveness. Having abnormal pH in your gut or urine can also affect the medication.

You didn't mention what strength your Dexedrine pills were, but the usual national maximum daily recommendations for medical use are in the 40-60 mg range if split into many doses throughout the day. Other identical instant release drugs are available as 20 or even 30 mg pills, although I understand needing to take 30 mg at once in an instant release form is rare.

Heart problems (and probably as a more common danger, drug abuse and addiction) can be a real danger at doses above the recommended therapeutic ranges, or if you have other risk factors in play regarding your general health. However, these official maximum daily recommendations are always heavily on the safe side. If you don't have any heart issues, you should be safe unless you go way past the maximum dosage.

To be even more careful, it can also be a good idea to avoid heavy physical exercise when under the effects of amphetamines, methylphenidates and other such stimulants. If they seem to considerably increase or ""strengthen"" your pulse, it's probably best to do your cardio either before taking them or after the effects have mostly worn off. It might not be very dangerous as such to exercise while on stimulants if you keep your heart rate in check, but your performance can suffer a lot.

Your size may also play a role here and in the drugs' effectiveness, although the science on this is still unclear. The vast majority of ADHD research so far has focused on children and it can be that many national maximum dosage recommendations are overly cautious because of this. I've noticed some more pro-stimulant physicians using body weight as a basis for calculating the maximum doses they prescribe. But this definitely doesn't mean that you need a big dose if you're a big guy, since effective dosage seems to completely depend on factors currently unknown to science.

Overall many physicians do seem to be overly cautious with the dosages they prescribe. Many have outdated/false information regarding the whole topic of stimulants, and unfortunately sometimes even questionable opinions about ADHD or using such medication in the first place. You should demand to see another doctor if yours is being unreasonable and won't prescribe you even the recommended maximum doses.

If you already were at the maximum dosage, there are other drugs to try out. Dexedrine/dexamphetamine is indeed often considered the ""final boss"" of **stimulants**, but mostly just because of its high abuse potential, not because its the most potent one. The best medication varies patient by patient, again because of unknown factors. Guanfacine and atomoxetine are two non-stimulant ADHD drugs that work well for many people. And if you haven't yet tried the other common stimulants Vyvanse, Medikinet and Concerta, it's worth going through them as well.

Some people are also finding success with modafinil. It's not generally approved for treating ADHD, but is sometimes prescribed for it off-label. I understand it's more ""hit-or-miss"" than most official ADHD medications, but if you run all out of options, try to find a physician that will prescribe modafinil to you.

People who have ADHD can also simultaneously suffer from depression and/or anxiety, often as a result of being undiagnosed for so long. So testing a few antidepressants with your physician can be a good idea, especially bupropion is one that is similarly used off-label purely for ADHD as well.

Many people also take a combination of different medicines, usually a non-stimulant and a stimulant. So if some stimulant seems to help a bit but not enough and you encounter a similar situation with a non-stimulant, combining the two could be worth trying. And sometimes a seemingly non-functioning drug might start working great when combined with another one. Taking dietary supplements such as zinc can also boost the effectiveness of your medication.

And remember that no pill is a miracle cure, so have realistic expectations - while stimulants may give you euphoria in the beginning, that is not supposed to last long-term. What the medication should be able to do, year after year, is to help you be less distracted and make it less impossible to finish even the boring tasks.

It's also important to come up with ways to adapt your life and routines to ADHD, which can even mean choosing your occupation and hobbies based on it, at least to some extent. I've realized over the years that even though certain lines of work really interest me, I simply couldn't do them properly because of the way my brain is wired. 

On the other hand, some jobs can be much more suitable for you than for most other people. For me, that's stuff which requires thinking outside the box and knowing a bit about tons of very different topics. Having clear schedules and simply working around other people can also give just the right amount of social pressure to get things done, but not too much to cause anxiety.

In any case, hopefully you will find something that works! Most people eventually land on a medication that makes their condition at least bearable. Having a good life with ADHD is very doable!"

Is there a Version of Dexedrine without gluten?,Interesting. I am having hives when taking concerta and was just starting to research if it has gluten or lactose since I am celiac with a dairy allergy <sigh>. I was just coming by to say I feel your pain.
Is there a Version of Dexedrine without gluten?,"TLDR; levels of gluten are so low it is safe for people with coeliac disease 

Hi! I had the same question and couldn't find much on the internet or the local Facebook groups (highly recommend!) so I thought I would go to the experts. 

I called Coeliac Australia after getting the number from the website. Their medical advisor actually has a statement on Aspen Dexamphetamine as they are frequently contacted about ritalin/dexies. The level of wheat per tablet is so low that you'd have to consume a huge number for it to have an effect on your gut - I think she said 1000 tablets a day? Either way, so far under the daily maximum dose that it isn't an issue. 

I'm not sure about wheat sensitivity but it could be worth giving them a buzz if you are still needing clarity. 

Good luck!"

Seems also a dick move to put gluten in medicines like this. They could use so many other things instead…"

Is there a Version of Dexedrine without gluten?,Thanks. Looked up costs etc looks like most compound aren’t covered by pbs so instead of a ten dollar script it might be 100s… in that case I could instead just try a different drug like adderall that is made gf anyway. But that kinda sucks.
Is there a Version of Dexedrine without gluten?,"I doubt it would be anywhere near that much. People get medicines compounded just to add flavours so more palatable for children and such.

Seriously - Just ring around and get a few prices on getting compounded dexamphetamine without gluten done.

You might even be able to get them to make it flavoured for you :D

We can't get Adderall in Australia

EDIT: I found a price list that had custom compounded extended release dex as an example - $55. Obviously your need is different but it's an indication it's unlikely going to be obscene

What is avaliable? Dexedrine, Ritalin and vyvanse?"
Is there a Version of Dexedrine without gluten?,"Everything but Adderall. None of the various pharmaceutical companies that have owned it over the years have applied to have it registered here.

So compounded dex would still be cheaper.

Also Desoxyn (Methamphetamine) not available here."

Adderall breaks down into 75% Dex and 25% Levoamphetamine

They would need to show quality research showing benefits over what we have cheaply here also in Dexamphetamine, as well as the other PBS listed medications for ADHD. While some people prefer Adderall over pure dex and vice versa, I've never seen any studies showing it is measurably better. Realistically, it's not that different."
Is there a Version of Dexedrine without gluten?,"Ok thanks for the explanation.

So far only a few days into dex the main drawback (aside from gluten) is only having 6-10 hours in a day covered and the rest spent being my normal adhd doofus self. But that doesn’t really sound fixed by any of the other meds unfortunately."
Is there a Version of Dexedrine without gluten?,"I've just started Atomoxetine along side the Vyvanse I've been on for 2 years.

Atomoxetine (You'll see it often referred to as Strattera) is the non stimulant ADHD med. It works 24/7.

Something to be aware of as an an option once you are settled with the stimulants. I'm only 2.5 weeks in and still increasing dose, and it take 4 - 8 weeks to get substantial response (with improvement often continuing all the way to 24 weeks) so it's a slow burn compared to the stims, but I would say it's been positive so far. :)

Is there a Version of Dexedrine without gluten?,Awesome. Did you find vyvanse wasn’t working well enough? Did you try dex first? How do they compare for you? And then what extra does the other non-stun one provide? I’m on an snri so wonder if it’ll be one drug too many if I had two for adhd
Is there a Version of Dexedrine without gluten?,"Vyvanse has worked well. (I also use regular dex as a booster). Vyvanse provides a smoothly delivered base I can modify with dex if needed. But I struggled with a set of symptoms I've learned are known as https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sluggish_cognitive_tempo

Research shows these respond better to atomoxetine. So stimulant for the core adhd. Atomoxetine for the SCT."
Is there a Version of Dexedrine without gluten?,How does sct present differently to inattentive? Sounds similar. I’ll prob end up trying vyvanse eventually to see what works best. So far Dex is great though
Is there a Version of Dexedrine without gluten?,"I can't really explain better than that wiki article (most of which was written by the foremost adhd expert in the world)

Great that dex works. Definitely look at vyvanse - The lisdexamfetamine breaks down into dexamphetamine over time so it would be the same effect - just a smoother delivery over time."
Is there a Version of Dexedrine without gluten?,"Thanks!

Interesting - strattera is an snri and I’m already taking one called Effexor. Wonder how similar it is.

Anyway lots of things to read up on now."

Dexedrine VS Adderall (both IR and XR) ?,"Those conversion should get you in the ballpark.

I process the XR very fast so I get a slow start and then a too strong hill and then the levo bit is still around cause havoc around hour 6.

My doc agreed with me chewing my er after splitting it. And taking it like it was ir.  So your 30 would give you two 15s.

The Dexedrine is the dextro part of the “mixed salts, no levo.  Dextro is a bit more effective.  5mg of dextro is about 7.5 of adderall.

They’re still short on my regular 20mg IRs but I was able to call around to a few different pharmacies until I found one with enough 10s in stock to give me the right amount total in mg but still it’s such a hassle taking twice as many pills per diem. I’ve been told to just call ahead and ask about supply before getting my Rx so I can request that my psychiatrist fill it in whatever tablet form they have most available, even if we have to mix and match tablets. Turns out Dexedrine makes me nauseous so I guess I’ll be stuck on this pharmaceutical grind until Teva can get more generics in circulation… ughhh yeah. it totally sucks.

Positive experiences with Dexedrine? Is it the same as Vyvanse basically?,"Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine) is like Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine) but its effects last longer. Overall it has fewer side effects.

Vyvanse is a prodrug of Dexedrine. Prodrugs are chemically-modified, inactive versions of their parent drugs. Dexedrine is the parent drug of Vyvanse.

Prodrugs are inactive until your body converts them into their parent drug. This conversion process is intended to improve absorption and reduce toxicity compared to the parent drug, which can result in fewer side effects.

Dexedrine works similarly to Vyvanse but it doesn’t need to be converted into an active form. It starts working as soon as the body absorbs it."
Positive experiences with Dexedrine? Is it the same as Vyvanse basically?,The short acting does exist but my is insurance won’t cover it (long acting no problem) for some resin and I’ve heard that it’s unreliable and always out of stock on the pharmacy side.

How do I deal with comedown depression? (Dexedrine),"This happened to me while on Vyvanse and still does. I think it’s because in that moment while we’re just doing nothing/not occupied with a task and we just hyper focus on our thoughts (aka what the medications function is). I’ve struggled with depressive thoughts throughout my life and so these thoughts have always been in my head. Now with the medication, I hyper focus on my sad thoughts and get fixated in that low mood because the medication is making those thoughts “enjoyable” or even more focused than they were before starting medication. 

I’d suggest reading a book or find an enjoyable show to take up ur spare time, especially if you have lots of spare time. It’s so easy to think of something worrisome and fall into these thoughts of despair. 💜💜"

How do I deal with comedown depression? (Dexedrine),[removed]
How do I deal with comedown depression? (Dexedrine),"Hey, thank you for your advice. I really appreciate it. You might be right about it just being part of just not doing anything right then when the thoughts creep in and nothing to distract me. I hope to feel like I can find something I am interested in before I go to sleep tonight. I wouldn't like to fall asleep with these thoughts in my head. ☹️"
How do I deal with comedown depression? (Dexedrine),"What makes you say this? The medication has been much more positive than negative to me. The only thing is the crash feels weird because I always want to be doing something but when it wears off I realize it's time to unwind. I feel like I could maybe practice doing something better.

Are you anti medication? Medication is the most optimal treatment for those with ADHD."
How do I deal with comedown depression? (Dexedrine),"Short answer: Yes, the effects of the crash went away, kind of.

Long answer: Yes, the anxiety/depression crash went away *provided* I was eating balanced meals at normal intervals. I notice I start to feel anxious if I'm coming down from the effects if I didn't feed myself enough. Another thing that helped me was actually engaging in something around the time that I would be coming down. I'll touch on that later.

I must mention this that I noticed that certain foods will actually trigger a very uncomfortable feeling physically and mentally if taken while I'm ""coming up"" on the medication. If I have too much acidic food, I will feel the need to vomit and have diarrhea. I don't know if you have this same issue, or noticed this same pattern, but I find avoiding acidic foods and foods high in Vitamin C until later in the day has been a good way to eat them without having the discomfort. I had tomato soup with my medication once and the reaction was intense and very uncomfortable and pretty much just wasted the dose as I spent some time throwing up and having diarrhea. I have had tomato soup when the medication wore off or as it was wearing off, and that was okay.

Your mileage may vary... and that goes with the next part.

You might know this already, but higher blood acidity will cause lower absorption for dextroamphetamine and also cause it to wear off faster. Dairy is will contribute to this effect as well, I believe. I would have to do more research on that, as I'm not certain on dairy because it does not influence blood acidity (at least I don't think). I don't have much Dairy in my diet, so this isn't really something I'm concerned about, but something to note, possibly (the dairy thing is just something I read somewhere).

I will say that it was a few days after this post that this intense crash went away and hasn't appeared since. But keep in mind I also had some environmental factors that might have helped me mitigate the symptoms of the crash. A lot of it has to do with how we handle the situation, not only the food we eat.

Hope this helps! Stick with it. If your symptoms progressively worsen, I'm sure you know what to do (contact your doctor).

Also I know what you mean with the intense focus. It was so similar to what I had been experiencing. I felt so focused but when it wore off, I was really empty inside because I wanted the focus to last longer."
How do I deal with comedown depression? (Dexedrine),"Don’t beat yourself up if you can’t find anything enjoyable to take part in!! Starting medication, finding the right dose, lifestyle changes, etc are not easy and it’s a journey.
Part of the problem for me is that I have no motivation at all (it has gotten a little better since I started medication). My doctor told me something that really resonated with me and helped me at least START the task or whatever. The ADHD medicine tricks your brain in thinking what you’re doing is enjoyable to you, so if you at least start the task, your brain will think it’s fun!! On those days I do have some motivation, this piece of advice really helped me! 

Take care bruv, you got this!!"

How do I deal with comedown depression? (Dexedrine),"Yes, I switched to Vyvanse. It's almost exactly like Dexedrine except that it lasts all day. I made a post about switching to Vyvanse and a lot of people said they preferred the effects of Dexedrine but had to switch to Vyvanse to avoid the ups and downs that Dex brings. 

I find I like Vyvanse way more all around. It's a lot more expensive though, so try and get as much coverage as possible. I live in Canada, and I'm pretty sure meds are a bit cheaper here though than a country like the US. Could be wrong though. 

One thing I notice is the focus from Vyvanse isn't as sharp, but it feels more smooth, and oddly almost feels more physically comfortable. Someone said it's Dexedrine with a blanket on it, and honestly there's no better description. Vyvanse is not as ""in your face"" as Dexedrine, but it literally lasts ALL DAY and that's definitely worth the switch. I'm a little new to Vyvanse but I'm definitely not new ro dextroamphetamine, so I think my experience might have value to you.

Do some research on Vyvanse if you haven't tried it already. There potential for a crash, but I have not experienced that. Probably because I was on Dex for a few months already."
How do I deal with comedown depression? (Dexedrine),"Alright, that’s your decision. Full disclosure: I take a small dose of these medications because my brain and body don’t respond the same anymore without them. I hope one day to be well enough not to need them.

How do I deal with comedown depression? (Dexedrine),"Thank you for the reply, yes I already have tried Vyvanse and as you mentioned it provided me a solid focus for 3-4 hours but after that I knew a crash was coming... Although I've to admit due to my curiosity I took a very high dose in my first days 60mg to kinda figure out what the drug has to offer at the fullest potential. but after that I took it responsibly.
My main problems were 2 things :
1- the crashes : I've not had any crashes for the first 2 days but after that the crashes started to coming to surface even at very small doses. 
2- insomnia : and oh my god it was a nightmare. The first time that I took the drug I was couldn't sleep for 36 hours straight. Even after taking taking extremely low doses ( 10mg ) I slept very very late 2-3am and made the quality of it very poor and extremely light. It was like my mind was wired for 18 hours each time I took it. You don't have any trouble with sleeps ?"
How do I deal with comedown depression? (Dexedrine),"When I first took Dexedrine, I took 5 mg and it felt like it lasted like 24 hours lol. I couldn't sleep. I eventually got used to Dex and figured out how to sleep with it. 

Switching to Vyvanse, I definitely felt like I could stay up later if I wanted, but I also felt like I could fall asleep if I wanted to. My mind doesn't race as much which makes it easier to fall asleep at the end of the day, but I also feel like I could still do stuff and focus on doing tasks if I want to (which isn't always the greatest idea).

Although amphetamines can contribute to insomnia, there's so many other factors to consider, like diet and exercise routine. I found doing vigorous exercise for even just 15 mins a day (I don't do it every day, but most days), it not only improves the effectiveness of my meds, it also helps me fall into a deeper sleep. I also just feel the exercise high and that really helps me feel better for the rest of the day. Keeping exercise as a part of my self-care routine since starting meds has been a huge contribution to my sleep-wake cycle being under control."
How do I deal with comedown depression? (Dexedrine),"Alright, so these comments aged like milk. I'm back on Dexedrine because Vyvanse started to suck ass. Just wanted to give you an update. Seem to have settled on a dose for now that's working really well and works for the whole day. Done with XR meds for now maybe forever idk I just hated it after a certain point. Vyvanse started to get ugly after a couple of weeks."
How do I deal with comedown depression? (Dexedrine),"Well to be completely honest the same thing has happened to me as well. I tried Vyvanse for 5-6 times and the side effects were just unbearable... After stopping, my dopamine levels has been downregulated to a point where I couldn't even get out bed or speak to other people. Also Vyvanse was disrupting my sleep heavily.
Unfortunately Dex is not accessible due to where I'm located so I'm on a hunt for other options for now..."
How do I deal with comedown depression? (Dexedrine),Damn. Sorry to read that. I really hope you can find something that works for you!!
Considering switching from Adderall to Dexedrine and looking for suggestions,"Dexedrine vs Adderall. Where do I start? Dexedrine is 100% Dextroamphetamine Sulfate while Adderall is 75% Dextroamphetamine/25% levoamphetamine. I switched from Adderall to Dexedrine because I did not like the effects of the Levoamphetamine (fast heart rate, sweating, stomach pain, etc.).  Plus I am not hyperactive. It’s typically a bit difficult to get at a pharmacy because supply and some pharmacist are idiots. I use an online pharmacy to get a 3 month supply. But overall to me, it’s more efficient than Adderall in a cognitive way. If you have good insurance the best form of Dextroamphetamine is Zenzedi but THAT has a big stock issue. I take the KVK Tech brand. Although they are big for 10mg. I sometimes chew them and wash em down with a drink. Other than that I find it has improved my life better than Adderall.

Rx: 
Dextroamphetamine Sulfate 10mg: Take 2 Tablets (20mg) twice daily (Max: 40mg daily) for ADHD INATTENTIVE TYPE."

Considering switching from Adderall to Dexedrine and looking for suggestions,"I am primarily inattentive and took 20mg addy (10 twice a day) and found that it helped a lot, but I also could tip into anxiety/social panic if I didn't eat and exercise with it. I just switched to Dex since I moved to another country where they don't make adderall, and I find it to be pretty comparable in terms of productivity, just dialed down the wired feeling I could get from adderall. I do think addy is better at turning the brain noise off though. And I still did miss an important appointment on dex, but medicated or not that happens to me at times anyway lmao."
Considering switching from Adderall to Dexedrine and looking for suggestions,Does the Dexedrine match what your adderall dosage was? I am thinking I could see About getting prescribed 15mg Dexedrine since 15 is 75% of 20. Is that how it works? How long do you find the Dexedrine lasts?
Considering switching from Adderall to Dexedrine and looking for suggestions,Any side effects with the KVK brand?
Considering switching from Adderall to Dexedrine and looking for suggestions,Hi there my physiologist is refusing to give dex. He said don’t even go there and completely gas lite me. He is switching me to focallin. I don’t want that. What online pharmacy do you use? Do you think it would be possible for me to go online too?
Considering switching from Adderall to Dexedrine and looking for suggestions,"You are correct actually plus more.

So being Adderall is 75% Dextroamphetamine some math is involved. Then there is also the fact that Dextroamphetamine in itself is more powerful than levoamphetamine. 

Adderall 30MG= 22.5MG Dextroamphetamine. 

Or 30MG Adderall x 0.75(%)= 22.5MG Dextroamphetamine.

So from here you also take the consideration that Dextroamphetamine, in general, is more powerful of the two (dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine). There is more to Adderall that can get more detailed but i am just summarizing it like this lol. 

Dextroamphetamine maximum dosage approved by the FDA is 60MG/day for adults.

Adderall (Mixed amphetamine salts) maximum dosage approved by the FDA is 60MG/day for adults.

Overall, Dexedrine is a more powerful stimulant and in my opinion more effective than Adderall. Also, it is safer on the heart since you are not taking the levoamphetamine in Adderall which causes more peripheral side effects on the cardiovascular system."

My mom says my Dexedrine just makes me do nothing faster,"You need to care about quality. Your writing shows you don't complete thing with great quality. 

Make a to do list.  In order.

Complete task a. Only cross it off when it is done.

Move on to task B.

If you get side track... Look at your list. 

I call it robot mode."
My mom says my Dexedrine just makes me do nothing faster,"The dexedrine isn't for your mom.  It's for you. 

If it's making your life better from your perspective, great.  

Otherwise, talk to your doc about trying a different medication.  

If you're in a constant state of panic, that likely means that your current responsibilities are not sustainable for you at your current rate of productivity, and have been for a while, and you're in a bunch of debt in the form of either undone work or accumulated stress.  You're gonna need to do *something* to get out from under that.  Either you find a med regimen that works better for you and lets you be more productive, or you'll eventually need some downtime to recover, or you're gonna need to not do some stuff.  

The less stuff that's in your head, the better.  If you can offload all the stuff you need to do into some sort of tracking system, then it's not taking up space in your head which gives you more brain to work on stuff.  But this often works poorly for ADHD folks, because you put it in the tracking system and then forget to ever look at it again, or your brain rapidly figures out that the tracking system is full of Bad Stuff and will go to any lengths to avoid looking at it.  So you need an accountabili-buddy to look at it with you periodically, and you have to be ruthless about what goes in the ""actually gonna do this"" column vs the ""punt on it"" column.  And you need to reward yourself for looking at it, to counteract the fact that it's always full of stuff you don't wanna look at.  Put some stuff you actually want to do in there too.

If it helps, I tried Vyvanse, and all I did while I was on it was scroll through Tumblr on my phone for hours.  Not helpful.  Strattera, on the other hand, just smooths out the anxiety and lowers the barrier to just doing stuff.  If the dose is too high, I start to feel a bit like a robot, but on the other hand, I just go do the dishes when they need doing, and normally I hate doing dishes.  So maybe give the Strattera a shot.

Strattera does take a while to work, though.  So if you're switching from Dexedrine to it, and you're already in the hole on a bunch of schoolwork, then you're likely going to have to deal with your brain's reaction to suddenly not taking Dexedrine (meaning you may be a zombie for a bit), *and* you're going to be effectively unmedicated until the Strattera kicks in. Ideally get some accommodation to reduce your workload until you've got your stuff dialed in."

Dexedrine Sore Throat Remedies?,Was your throat sore on the lower doses?
Dexedrine Sore Throat Remedies?,"No, I had the loss of appetite symptom on lower doses but the sore throat started on the 25 unfortunately"
"If I switch from Dexedrine to Vyvanse, will I have any side effects from Vyvanse? I know they're both dextroamphetamine, but wondering if anyone would know. Other Vyvanse questions.","Your post speaks to me! I feel like I've gone through exactly this. I've been on vyvanse for the last 3 months or so after Dex for about 9 months. 

Honestly, I kinda miss the benefits of the Dex because while vyvanse is great, the Dex was better. But I had the same issues with dex, and would need to remember to take so many pills throughout the day, it was inconvenient. 

I found one downside with vyvanse is that I've gotta make ""the call"" before about 8am as to whether I take my dose. If I go later, I'll probably have trouble sleeping. I find there's not so much a ""peak"" like with Dex. It's more of a consistent flow throughout the day. So my challenge is that while I do get better motivation, concentration etc, it's not as focused as with Dex.

So no, it doesn't feel like 5mg Dex for the whole day. Its kinda like the Dex for the whole day, but with a blanket on top so it's not so extreme (for lack of a better word). 

I'm hoping though, that the Vyvanse is enough for me to have that brain space to come up with better techniques to help my concentration and organisation etc. 

I don't have a crash with vyvanse. It's different for everyone though, give it a shot, if you aren't impressed go back?"
"If I switch from Dexedrine to Vyvanse, will I have any side effects from Vyvanse? I know they're both dextroamphetamine, but wondering if anyone would know. Other Vyvanse questions.","I know I'm a few days late to the party... But just like u/Weil65Azure said... This post speaks to me also! I just transitioned from Dexedrine IR (10 mg x 2-3) to Vyvanse (50 mg) w/ 5 mg Dex booster. Before those I took Adderall XR (30mg x1).

Honestly, I like the direct approach of the Dexedrine. It gives me that boost I need to get my stuff done (hence why I take the Dex booster in the morning). But like others said, too many ups and downs for me and I really hated having to keep track of the time everyday to see when I needed to re-dose. I also got a decent amount of tunnel vision on Dexedrine but it wasn't as bad as Adderall XR for me. The Dexedrine also makes me hungry, unlike Adderall XR and Vyvanse which nuke my hunger.

The Vyvanse on the other hand makes me feel just right. I definitely feel more in the moment on Vyvanse than I did on Dexedrine IR and Adderall XR. I realized that the Vyvanse effects are extremely dependent on the things you eat/consume (because of the mechanics of the lisdexamfetamine in the body). I actually feel increased effects from the Vyvanse when I eat which is a really strange feeling to me, but it makes sense. The comedown at the end of the day has felt really good honestly, no crashes for me. Its been good to me honestly.. 

You should give it a try. Just make sure your insurance covers it because its really expensive. Give us an update on what you decide to do!! Good luck!"
"If I switch from Dexedrine to Vyvanse, will I have any side effects from Vyvanse? I know they're both dextroamphetamine, but wondering if anyone would know. Other Vyvanse questions.","- around 12 hours. 
- pretty much. I take around 7.30am each morning. 
- kicks in around 9am and pretty good for most of day. I feel quite tired towards the end of the day when it wears off but good to force me to relax and wind down a bit. 
- no idea on dose but seek advice from a professional. I went from 20mg to 60mg over a period of around 8 weeks. 

I feel pretty good for most of the days really. Had some side effects that have all worn off as I’ve got used to it but still a few issues with disrupted sleep at times. No perfect but seems to work well for me. Only really get a crash if I don’t keep up with food / water properly throughout the day. Snacks and proper meals are essential."
"If I switch from Dexedrine to Vyvanse, will I have any side effects from Vyvanse? I know they're both dextroamphetamine, but wondering if anyone would know. Other Vyvanse questions.",Very different in my experience. Vyvanse is much smoother and less intense yet lasts extremely long.

"If I switch from Dexedrine to Vyvanse, will I have any side effects from Vyvanse? I know they're both dextroamphetamine, but wondering if anyone would know. Other Vyvanse questions.","I've been making the switch from 4x dex/day to vyvanse. I was having a dex every 3 hours from 7am. Complained to my doctor that I was having trouble sleeping due to the late dex in the afternoon and too many ups and downs throughout the day. 

Trying 70mg this week but been working my way up. I have found that I didn't get comparable effects until about 60mg. The conversion back to the IR is not simple and varies depending with individuals too. 

Something else I have found interesting too is I have had to ditch caffeine in the morning.. Any caffeine, mainly coffee, and I was anxious and irritable. I'll slowly introduce it back and am okay with afternoon coffee. Was not a problem having a double/triple shot in the AM on the dex though. I'm getting a good 10 hour coverage and better sleep which is nice. 

Good luck!"

I am currently on dexedrine and will be getting a script for vyvanse tomorrow as I also don't want to be taking multiple pills a day. I'll also be on a 5mg dex booster and then vyvanse. I am awake from 5am-9pm so have a long day every week day. I was thinking of taking my booster right when I wake up at 5 and then taking the vyvanse an hour later as I know it can take up to 2 hours to kick in. Can you tell me your experience with taking the booster first and vyvanse second and what your timing looks like for what? Thanks in advance!

Other Vyvanse questions.","Yeah it's so hard to figure out whether things have helped. Like...how am I supposed to know if I remember things more!? And saying ""the bees in my head have stopped buzzing as much"" doesn't quite hit it either haha. 

Yes vyvanse is kinda more pleasant in a way. The Dex was great but having so many ups and downs throughout the day was a bit tedious. Once I got through the initial first few weeks (new medication, side effects settled down quick), it's just a prolonged, smoother effect. 

And yeah, I started on 70mg because that was my nearly equivalent Dex dose. But I was super scatter brained, chatty etc. So I'm now up to 110mg and that is much better. I think if I went higher though it'd be too much, particularly if I drink a coffee the heart doesn't like that. 

Doc and I talked about pretty much exactly this. I concluded that I'd stick this out for a while and see how I go, considering the benefits are still very much there. I'm thinking I can work on improving my concentration and motivation in the meantime through other means, e.g. exercise, healthy habits, bullet journalling etc. So putting the medication in combination with working on those skills in life, hopefully it'll get better over time (we shall see!)"
"If I switch from Dexedrine to Vyvanse, will I have any side effects from Vyvanse? I know they're both dextroamphetamine, but wondering if anyone would know. Other Vyvanse questions.","For me, this is how my schedule goes IF I take the booster in the morning..

Morning Vitamins: 7 am

5 mg Dexedrine booster: 8 am 

50 mg Vyvanse: 11-11:30 am

Nightly Vitamins: 10 am 

This usually allows me to get about 10 hours of coverage. However, lately I've been taking the booster in the evening instead (6-7pm) because I often do the bulk of my college schoolwork then. Vyvanse takes 40-50 mins to kick in for me and Dexedrine IR usually takes about 15-20 minutes to kick in for me. I also get 6-8 hours of sleep every night.

I titrated up to 50mg vyvanse and I think this is where I’ll stay for now as this feels good. In 2 weeks time I’m gonna get a booster of 5mg Dexedrine (yet to determine if I need 1 or 2.. I’m usually only getting 8 hours of coverage from vyvanse after it kicks in).  How would you compare taking the booster in the morning vs at night? I know you mentioned your come downs are ok. Sometimes mine are too but sometimes I get this offensive, dull, headache that lasts hours. Do your vitamins help with the crash? I’m curious to know what your cocktail of morning vs night vitamins are! Are there foods you notice help enhance your experience? I also notice that if I’m not eating consistently enough during the day I go through waves of feeling like garbage but then as soon as I eat, I feel back to 100% again. It’s actually helped me with intuitive eating.

Why is the Vyvanse come down/anxiety so much worse than Dexedrine?,"the doseage is probably too high, but there could be several other factors at play. 

&#x200B;

when I start to get more anxiety, it's because my dosage is too high, I've been taking it for too long, or I have been indulging in high dopamine activities while taking it. 

I hate to say it, but porn and fapping absolutely gives me anxiety if I'm taking medication. Like, idk, something about the dopamine of the medication + dopamine of fapping/porn, it just leads to this HORRIBLE comedown and lots of anxiety. 

&#x200B;

I also noticed a similar effect with energy drinks, caffine, and video games. It's just more pronounced with the stronger simuli."
Why is the Vyvanse come down/anxiety so much worse than Dexedrine?,"So interesting cause I have social anxiety naturally and vyvanse lessens that considerably. puts likena weight on my chest, that I feel throughout the day."
Why is the Vyvanse come down/anxiety so much worse than Dexedrine?,"This DEFINITELY holds true. No, everything can not be explained by simple logic ""they are same medication therefore should act exactly in the same way"" . They don't. Each medication affects your body differently and each person differently. It's not just a question of dose either. The probelm with vyvanse is the crashes are ALOT harder and last alot longer. I get craahes up to 6-8 hours on vyvanse even child doses while on dexedrine i can literally go to sleep during tve crash or its effects. On vyvanse it feels like my soul is trying to leave my body during its crash.  Dont fight it, ditch vyvanse, if dex is workifn that much better try grtting its extended release form (dexedrine XR spansules). Its dexedrine that should last around 6-8 hours."
Why is the Vyvanse come down/anxiety so much worse than Dexedrine?,"It can only really be dose related. The extended release is all in delaying the release. After 4 hours there is not really any lisdexamphetamine left. It's all dexamphetamine. 

The come down is the same for IR Dex and Vyvanse. You can see the Vyvanse AUC here

In one reply you've said 'According to stimulant dose conversion, 40mg of vyvanse is 12.5mg Dexedrine. So, today, technically I've had 22.5mg equivalent with the 10mg booster'

Technically kind of. But lisdexamphetamine is almost indestructible in the stomach and has close to a 100% absorption rate. It isn't affected  Typically dex is 75 - 100%, and is sensitive to acidity so if you are taking with, or near consuming acidic food or drink absorption will reduce further.

I've seen people on here move to Vyvanse taking under half the 'equivalent' dose.

TL:DR: Likely dose related - You get 100% of Vyvanse pretty reliably, which might not be the case for the Dexerdrine."
Why is the Vyvanse come down/anxiety so much worse than Dexedrine?,"I experienced similar things. I used to take Vyvanse 30mg (and eventually 40mg) and I kept experiencing a lot of physical symptoms and the inability to sleep or get hunger cues. It was very hard winding down, and it's why I barely took that medication because of its side effects. Now I've been taking dexedrine 5mg for about two weeks on and off, and it is a lot smoother. It's a low dose compared to before, but I take 10mg occasionally and it seems to help me get focused a bit better and I don't experience any issues with sleep now. I'm not sure if the dose difference is why or just how some people bodies process medications differently. Despite being similar to adderall, I don't get anxiety with dexedrine unlike I did when I briefly took adderall."

Cheers. Hmmm, maybe? I am prescribed Dexedrine 30mg a day and don't have the issues to this extent. According to [stimulant dose conversion](https://psychopharmacopeia.com/stimulant_conversion.php), 40mg of vyvanse is 12.5mg Dexedrine.

>when I start to get more anxiety, it's because my dosage is too high, I've been taking it for too long, or I have been indulging in high dopamine activities while taking it. 

Hmmm. Yeah, maybe? This weekend I did masturbate to porn quite a bit? That may be an issue? I also had two coffees. Okay, sure, these variables make sense in hindsight lol.

I think, when the days allow it, I'm going to have a couple of days off the meds completely and perhaps avoid porn for a bit. Cheers."

I know you're not a medical professional, but in your experience would you say reducing my dose will see less therapeutic benefits given I've now built up a tolerance of 30mg? I personally think it would be ideal to have a couple days off, indeed a week, but my schedule means this is difficult."
Why is the Vyvanse come down/anxiety so much worse than Dexedrine?,Make sure you exercise daily and get lots of food and water. It’s easy to forget these things and get hyper focused on whatever you’re doing. Comedowns for me are always better when I’m hydrated and have eaten a lot.
Why is the Vyvanse come down/anxiety so much worse than Dexedrine?,"I think it's the fact that it's stimulating the CNS and can replicate the physical symptoms of anxiety despite not actually being anxious. I disliked that feeling with vyvanse, but like the other redditor said, for them it's like a weighted blanket. In a way, it is grounding because I am more hyper-aware of my body, but that's not necessarily a good thing for me being autistic as well since being more hyper aware leads to increased anxiety."
Why is the Vyvanse come down/anxiety so much worse than Dexedrine?,So for me the pressure feels good. it grounds me. Most of the time I feel the unbearable lightness of being and it's a lot. but that chest feeling comes with me being able to stick out the moments. it's like a lil weighted blanket anchoring me. It just makes me okay with feeling the normal weight of being alive
Why is the Vyvanse come down/anxiety so much worse than Dexedrine?,"I'm curious how long you have been on meds for?

My guess is you aren't actually experiencing a come down, you are actually over stimulated. Everything you describe is basically what happen when you have too much. Always remember these are amphetamines.

Higher doses will always seem better at first due to the euphoric effect, which produces an effortless motivation. So you may see a drop in motivation if you are still early on in this and experiencing euphoric effects.

All the other stuff it's about getting in that ideal 'band'. Too much and the stimulant effects will give you other adhd like issues.

I'm guessing you are concerned that if you drop to 30mg Vyvanse and it's not enough you a stuck with a prescription for it.

You can use your 40s to experiment. Rather than take a week off, you can open the capsules and dissolve the powder in water and measure out smaller doses. Try 30mg. Try 20mg"
Why is the Vyvanse come down/anxiety so much worse than Dexedrine?,"Cheers. Feeling somewhat better now after going on a run.

>I'm curious how long you have been on meds for?

Been back on them for about 2 months. I was originally on them from November 2017 to March 2020, but went off as I wanted to give treating my ADHD without the amphetamines. I don't regret this period, however now going back on them, I can see how many facets of my life subtly were affected by ADHD.

I started back on 15mg, and then my psychiatrist suggested returning to my original dose of 30mg for Dexedrine OR 40mg vyvanse with a 10mg booster. 

>My guess is you aren't actually experiencing a come down, you are actually over stimulated. Everything you describe is basically what happen when you have too much. Always remember these are amphetamines.

Yes, agreed completely. Stimulation and therapeutic effects are a bell-curve. I went over my caffeine dose today as well, which explains all of this. 

>Higher doses will always seem better at first due to the euphoric effect, which produces an effortless motivation. So you may see a drop in motivation if you are still early on in this and experiencing euphoric effects.

Indeed. It's easy for one to subtly misconstrue the euphoria for the therapeutic benefit. The euphoria is gone, and that's okay. I think this is an issue with over stimulation, including caffeine.

>I'm guessing you are concerned that if you drop to 30mg Vyvanse and it's not enough you a stuck with a prescription for it.

Kind of. I am concerned that if I reduce my dosage that even the therapeutic benefits will be gone since I've been on 30mg of Dexedrine/40mg Vyvanse + 10mg Dexedrine booster? 

>You can use your 40s to experiment. Rather than take a week off, you can open the capsules and dissolve the powder in water and measure out smaller doses. Try 30mg. Try 20mg

That's a great idea! I think I am just going to stick to Dexedrine for a few days though, but try 20mg rather than 30mg. Thanks again."

"Awful side effects from Adderall...Anyone switched to another drug successfully? What do you prefer? (Vyvanse, dexedrine, etc) Thank you!","Hey so I was on adderall Xr 10 mg. I got horrible nausea. I switched to concerta, same problem. So I gave up. Now I just suffer. I really have nothing else to say, sorry."
"Awful side effects from Adderall...Anyone switched to another drug successfully? What do you prefer? (Vyvanse, dexedrine, etc) Thank you!","Yeah, Adderall was the worst one for me. Vyvanse is my goldilocks, I've been on it for 8 years very successfully. Though I tried them ALL before I finally found Vyvanse. Dex was the second best for me, and so on. Everyone is different, so if you're open to trying a couple, it's well worth it to find the right one!"
"Awful side effects from Adderall...Anyone switched to another drug successfully? What do you prefer? (Vyvanse, dexedrine, etc) Thank you!","TL;DR: Been on Adderall, Vyvanse and Strattera. Strattera is the lesser evil of the 3.

Strattera was better until I had to titrate my dose up. Then I kept waking up at night. It can cause over-sensitive bladder, which is at least what I noticed when it woke me up. I was pretty awake though too, so not sure what was the chicken or the egg? Maybe I woke up and just happened to notice I had to pee too. But I'm ridiculously sensitive to medications, usually baby doses are effective, if there's a chance of GI upset or agitation, it happens. Vyvanse made me agitated nearly out of mind. Adderall was great for years, but it started giving me bad GERD, probably had been all along, just took awhile to bother me really bad. Also started getting agitation with it. With that one, I'm a bit inclined to think the quality of the generics was a factor as well. Hope this info helps you some. I'm still on a baby dose of strattera. It's better than nothing. I supplement it with caffeine and white-knuckled willpower. Or I just fail. Depends on the day. Umph, not sure this info is helpful???? 
ADHD sucks. ADHD and menopause is a wretched creature all its own."
"Awful side effects from Adderall...Anyone switched to another drug successfully? What do you prefer?

The side effects were horrible and even on the XR it felt like a rollercoaster ride all day. In the evenings I would just sit there and stare at a wall and hate everything. 

I tried a few non stimulant options that didn’t work and then tried vyvanse which is what ended up working for me. It’s way smoother, less side effects in general and usually no crash unless I haven’t slept or eaten or whatever"

"Awful side effects from Adderall...Anyone switched to another drug successfully? What do you prefer? (Vyvanse, dexedrine, etc) Thank you!","Adderall heightened my anxiety to an unbearable degree. I had been taking Evekeo before but switched to Adderall bc I didn't feel like the Evekeo was working, turns out I was having brain fog from a vitamin deficiency so I'm back on Evekeo now. Nobody really takes it so it's quite expensive, but if you go down that route I would look into the Orally Disintegrating Tablets (Evekeo ODT) bc you might be able to get a savings card for it (you can just take it like a regular tablet anyway).

"Awful side effects from Adderall...Anyone switched to another drug successfully? What do you prefer? (Vyvanse, dexedrine, etc) Thank you!","Yup! I started at 10mg, which it doesn't come in, so I had to split it up into water. Giant pain in the ass! I don't remember how long I did that for, but I went to 20mg when I could, just because it was easier. I stayed at 20mg for good while, but did go to 30mg after a couple years. Stable there for a couple years, then went to 40mg. I was on 40mg for my pregnancies, but during mat leave I didn't need that amount, so I dropped to 30mg. Went back to 40mg when I came back from mat leave in September, but it really didn't feel that effective, so I recently upped to 60mg. So yeah, I needed to increase in that time, but pretty slowly. 

Overall I'm not that concerned about tolerance. Yes, I have needed to increase, but I also had weight changes in that time that could account for some of that. My doctor also isn't concerned about the rate of my increase. I know from my previous experience that I could easily go back to Dex if Vyvanse stops working for me in the next couple decades, but I found Dex a bit TOO much, even at the lowest dose, so I'll just stay on Vyvanse. 

Not sure if this helps! I mostly don't worry about it these days. It's working currently, my doctor's are supportive currently, so that's what I focus on."

Dexedrine vs. Adderall,Dextroamphetamine is much more potent centrally than levoamphetamine. Adderall contains 75% dextroamphetamine and 25% levoamphetamine. Dexedrine is pure dextroamphetamine. Levoamphetamine has a longer half life and has more peripheral effects in comparison to dextroamphetamine. This is likely why you're noticing different effects and a harder crash from the dextroamphetamine vs the mixture in adderall.

"The switch from Vyvanse to Adderall, Concerta, Dexedrine??","Switched from Vyvanse 60mg to Adderall 30mg, now at 50mg due to cost. Vyvanse also felt too “mild” for me, and Adderall seems better (but not perfect) at doing the heavy lifting that I personally need from my meds.

One thing you could try before switching is to try breakfast with protein, staying well fed (snacks) and hydrating, as I noticed those all made a big difference in how well the Vyvanse worked for me."
"The switch from Vyvanse to Adderall, Concerta, Dexedrine??",I switched from Adderall to Vyvanse because my pharmacy couldn't get my Adderall due to the shortage. So I can't really help you. I guess at the end of the day everyone's different and you just have to find what works for you.

Dexedrine Dose?,">Why is your dose so high? Why are you looking at increasing it? Specifically what impairments are you trying to treat that aren't being treated effectively?

I wasn't sure if it was high, but I wouldn't be surprised.  When I was on Vyvanse, I was definitely over the usual 70 mg, as I took 90 mg a day.  


I find the Dex helps with my focus, fidgeting and impulsivity.  It also eliminates my anxiety when I take it. That said, when I first started taking stimulants, I found that if I took my first dose an hour or so before I had to wake up, it was WAY easier to get out of bed.  Then I started taking a medication for my bipolar disorder, and since then not even the 30 mg of Dex I take in the morning can help me get out of bed.  I frequently sleep through multiple alarms, and even if I put my phone away from the bed, I will get up, turn off my alarm, and find myself back in bed or on the couch asleep with no memory of getting up to turn off my alarm.  I am having trouble getting to work on time.  I get around eight hours of sleep at night, so I don't think that is an issue. I was hoping I could increase my dose to 45 mg in the morning to see if that helps."
Dexedrine Dose?,"Vyvanse converts to just under 1/3 dex. So even at 90mg Vyvanse that's a little under 30mg active dexamphetamine. Conversely at your dose of 60mg Dex would be 195mg Vyvanse. And you are suggesting to got up to 244mg Vyvanse equivalent.

The issue with what you are suggesting is two fold. 

1) Dexamphetamine is being prescribed to help with ADHD impairments. You are seeking more not to help with ADHD but to wake up in the morning

2) What your suggesting is you want to take an amount of dexamphetamine which is the sort of amount a fairly heavy addict would use. Dexamphetamine becomes neurotoxic at high levels among other problems. 

You are going down a dangerous path my friend."
Dexedrine Dose?,"I guess I am just going to have deal with the exhaustion then.  


I find it fascinating that I only respond to high amounts of stimulants, but if I take lithium or any antipsychotics I respond to tiny, tiny doses.  I wish I understood more about the brain to figure out why that is the case.  


I am not too worried about my current dose of Dex - it has been reviewed by two psychiatrist, a pharmacist that specializes in psychiatric medications, and a general pharmacist."
Dexedrine Dose?,Is the medication Lithium making you tired? Have you tried lamotragine?
Dexedrine Dose?,"I did try Lamotrigine and it did very little for mood regulation, but it managed to make me completely idiotic.  The cognitive dysfunction it caused took months to reverse when I went off of it.    


I currently take Lithium, Clozapine and Latuda.  I would say the latter two are the ones that cause the most fatigue.  That said, prior to being on any medications, I was *always* tired except from 8 pm - 1 am.  I think I probably have some kind of Circadian rhythm disorder but I have never had any sleeping testing done with the exception of sleep apnea (which I do not have)."
Dexedrine Dose?,"Have you ever tried aripriprazole? It's a stimulating atypical antipsychotic that is used for bipolar. May be an option rather than latuda.

Does this sound like you? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sluggish_cognitive_tempo"
Dexedrine Dose?,">Have you ever tried aripriprazole?

I have tried it twice - once in the pill form and I could only handle it for two weeks, and for three months in the injectable form. It was horrible - akathisia and anxiety beyond anything I had ever experienced."
Dexedrine Dose?,">Does this sound like you?   
>  
>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sluggish\_cognitive\_tempo

No, I can't say that this describes what I experience.  Mine feels more like ""Almost narcolepsy"".  


If I am not mentally AND physically stimulated, I just fall asleep.  Like in a university lecture I have to be eating snacks and asking a million questions or playing a computer game or else BOOM asleep.  If I am doing computer work, I have to have the work I am doing, a tv show, and usually a mint or popcorn.  If not?  Asleep.  I was once at a presentation for work, and I was sitting next to my boss, and guess what?  I fell asleep.  Luckily he liked me and thought it was hilarious, but I was pretty embarrassed.  

When looking at the ADHD symptoms, I am definitely a combined type.   The only SCT symptoms I have are:  Trouble staying awake or alert and Prone to daydreaming."
Dexedrine Dose?,"My wife had akathisia on it too, not fun.

I hope you don't mind all the questions, I am genuinely interested.

I think the key for you is tackling the exact underlying items that cause the sleep issues. Throwing more dex at it is like if the heater in your house broke, so you set the house next door on fire for warmth. It's missing that target so taking a lot more. The type of stimulation provided by dexamphetamine is very narrow.

Sounds like you've got two issues. The usual ADHD sleep issue (75% of people with ADHD have delayed sleep phase disorder). And the issues from the atypical antipsychotic (I suspect largely Clozapine). I'm familiar with the feeling, I use Olanzapine to help sleep sometimes and even on a tiny amount getting out of bed the next morning is almost impossible.

If you are in the US, you could likely even go down overall dosage to Adderall which is 75/25 dex/levoamphetamine. Or just amphetamine which results in a 50/50 split

Levoamphetamine is less psycho active but a stronger CNS stimulant than dex. I still wouldn't call it ideal, but would be an improvement.

If you are outside the US - You might look at Agomelatin (Valdoxan). It's classed as an antidepressant, but it doesn't really have direct antidepressant effects. It's entire mechanism of action is based on depression being cause by a broken circadian rhythm. So it is intended to correct that.

There's modafinal, which I would suspect that you probably already know of.

But I would wonder if the key is seeing if you can stop the Clozapine. If you take a look at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypical\_antipsychotic#Binding\_profile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypical_antipsychotic#Binding_profile) you'll see it is a strong antagonist of H1. That's the histamine receptor. It's what sleeping tablets target, and if you've ever had OTC sleeping tablets they a similarly brutal in the morning. Lurasidone (Latuda) doesn't affect it. But they both are also antagonists for a1 and a2 which will cause drowsiness, and all 4 dopamine receptors. Out of all of those dexamphetamine is only really an agonist for d1 and d2.

But I expect the really brutal morning issue is the H1 antagonism from the Clozapine"
Dexedrine Dose?,"I am going to have to look into Valdoxan.  I am in Canada, but I haven't heard of it.  It sounds very interesting though!  


I am already on modafinil as well (100 mg in the am, 100 mg in the afternoon).  It has makes zero difference, so I won't be taking it as of next week.  I gave it a try for three months, so I think it was a good period of time to see if it would be effective, and it definitely wasn't.  


Unfortunately I can't get rid of the Clozapine.  The side effects are hell - I am now obese even though I spent my whole life at a healthy weight, and a lot of the fatigue can definitely be attributed to it.  I mean, I always had the delayed sleep phase issues and the sudden falling asleep if understimulated, but the Clozapine added a whole new element.  That said, adding Clozapine has done wonders for my mental health.  I actually has an appointment with my psychiatrist today and requested my dose be increased.  It is like a miracle drug for me!"
Dexedrine Dose?,"Most people I've seen add Modafinil to Amphetamine report a similar thing. That is doesn't do anything. So I'm not suprised to hear you say that.

I hop you don't mind I'm going to pick through you meds now.

A key effect of dexamphetamine is as an Agonistic (Activator) of D1 and D2

Lurasidone is a strong antagonist of D2 in particular. It doeasn't bring anything to the table that Clozapine doesn't. You can see from the binding table that Clozapine hits everything. It's why it \*can\* be effective for a heap of things, but carrys a lot of side effects. I would ask the question why are you on both. The strong D2 antagonism in particular will limit your dex effectiveness.

Ultimately the Atypical are all variations of neurological carpet bombs. The tick is finding the one that hits the bit you get benefit from. 

I don't know if you've tried Risperidone, but it has a similar profile to Clozapine, but with less H2 antagonism (Meaning it will be less harsh getting up in the morning) and doesn't touch M1 and M3 which don't really have a positive neurological effect, but only bring side effects like diabetes risk.

If the weaker 5-HT receptor action is an issue, you would look at adding (or if that's what is giving you the therapeutic benefit, replacing it with) Vortioxetine which is targets all those strongly.

I know I don't know you, but I know Psychs tend to hrow stuff at the wall and see what sticks a bit. So I'm legit trying to help, if it is unwanted let me know :)

TL;DR

I would question why you are taking Lurasidone and Clozapine. Clozapine is a hugely broad reaching drug, so Lurasidone is likely just increasing side effects and reducing Dex effectiveness.

Possibly look at switching from Clozapine to Risperidone. It will reduce the issues your having with the side effects, and hopefully remain effective.

Another one to discuss with your Dr is the Vortioxetine. It hits all those 5-HT bits, but without the Dopamine antagonist effects which reduce your dex effectiveness and make you tired.

So while Clozapine works, and some people need all it's effects. Most don't and it just works because it effects everything"

Do you guys ever feel a crushing sadness sometimes?,"Yeah I’ve always been like that, but I’m also on the spectrum. So I’m not sure that’s an ADHD thing."
Do you guys ever feel a crushing sadness sometimes?,Oh you mean when you stare into the void and and are filled with a sense of numbness and lack of emotion while your head swirls with every thought in existence at once? Then I realize I haven’t taken my meds in a few days and really ought to.
Do you guys ever feel a crushing sadness sometimes?,ever since i was little. it’s overwhelming sometimes and i often have a hard time differentiating between what i project and what i just pick up from body language. maybe it is an adhd thing but maybe it’s just an empathy thing paired with emotional dysregulation?
Do you guys ever feel a crushing sadness sometimes?,"Why people thinks eating alone is sad?

Do you guys ever feel a crushing sadness sometimes?,"Yeah but it’s more inward than outward facing. There’s been several big life transitions happening at once—career changes, health matters, relationships running their course—that are hitting at once. It’s a lot and I’m feeling the L’s in a way that’s bigger than usual."
Do you guys ever feel a crushing sadness sometimes?,Yes. Always.
Do you guys ever feel a crushing sadness sometimes?,"Yeah for different reasons, a big one is nostalgia. Takes my breath away and I have to work hard to get out of it. Its super frustrating and I don't understand how other people don't have to deal with this."
Do you guys ever feel a crushing sadness sometimes?,"I have ADHD but also HSP, I too get this."
Do you guys ever feel a crushing sadness sometimes?,Yes ... I find life so soul crushing sometimes ... it takes a lot to pull myself out of it

It's just something I guess we have to deal with. I've been using meditation techniques to help me stave off the sadness"

Do you guys ever feel a crushing sadness sometimes?,"Only in high stress moments when I cannot fix a problem I have made and I once again realise the colossal fuck up I am.

I have ADHD and Dyspraxia"
Do you guys ever feel a crushing sadness sometimes?,Do you ever get a headache that goes along with it?
Do you guys ever feel a crushing sadness sometimes?,I think that's just part of being human and nothing to do with ADHD in general. In your situation ADHD might cause your particular crushing sadness but pretty much every human will at some point experience crushing sadness at various intervals for various reasons.
Do you guys ever feel a crushing sadness sometimes?,"Yes, sometimes I come over horrifically sad but it’s always in the shower 🤷🏻‍♀️ such a horrible feeling."
Do you guys ever feel a crushing sadness sometimes?,"This happens to me but not randomly and without a trigger. With me it's more a few moments of deep compassion, but like a mourning, over the silliest of things."
Do you guys ever feel a crushing sadness sometimes?,"Occasional bouts of sudden sadness? Yeah, sometimes. But your examples I'm not so sure about; if anything I *am* that guy eating alone in a restaurant. But not because I'm ""lonely"", I just love eating good food and I don't always wanna wait for friends to be available to eat out. Don't be sad for us solo diners, we're doing just fine! 😁"
Do you guys ever feel a crushing sadness sometimes?,Stimulants makes everything intense!

Do you guys ever feel a crushing sadness sometimes?,"An overactive sense of justice is listed as a symptom of adhd. You see someone having a bad time and it bothers you to see the unfairness of life. I have it too, but I lead with rationalization. Life is brutal and unfair and noone gets out alive. I still feel for the lame and the lonely, but life being brutal is the norm. Do something nice for them if it bothers you enough, we only rose out of homicidal chimp people because we decided to make things a little better, one little thing at a time."
Do you guys ever feel a crushing sadness sometimes?,That's when the boredom hits me and I can't be happy for at least a 10-30 minutes .
Do you guys ever feel a crushing sadness sometimes?,Yes
Do you guys ever feel a crushing sadness sometimes?,Yes. Often when I am anxious. The sadness can be pretty irrational and I dont really know where it comes from. It often has it rooths in some kind of empathy like you also said you have.
Do you guys ever feel a crushing sadness sometimes?,"Yes but I think it's me picking up on something else in the environment rather than me just being sad on its own, like with depression.

I might've picked up on someone who looks sad, or it's a lot of little things that compounded before I realize it was affecting me. 

Then again, I was raised in trauma along with already being highly observant. So reading the room was not only something I already did but became necessity. 

The rest of my family don't feel as strongly as me, so I don't think it's ADHD. The ones who are most like me all have signs of OCD too, so I assume it's something with the nervous system being overactive or being hyper aware constantly."
Do you guys ever feel a crushing sadness sometimes?,"*all the time 

Well, really just MOST of the time. "
Do you guys ever feel a crushing sadness sometimes?,"No, I think that’s just empathy. Emotionally intelligent people tend to think about it, and therefore also feel it more often."
Do you guys ever feel a crushing sadness sometimes?,"Absolutely, I find every emotion hits me much much harder than my peers, friends, and family. When I get mad, it's like a burning iron in my brain. When I find a new song I like I actively headbang, dissolve in my chair, or cry in tears of joy. If I'm sad it spirals into a severe depression lasting weeks. If I'm anxious I start speaking like a manic person and laughing nervously a lot. If I'm bored it's like someone is pinching a nerve in my spine and I can't sit still.

It's like if their emotional curve ends at 10 I go up to 15. Someone with bipolar or who is on drugs by that logic goes up to say 25. Now that I'm on medication I go up to maybe like an 8 or 9 I would say. It feels like more of a reduction in the moment but I remind myself that I feel things as much as normal people do now and it's a lot easier to match the energy level in a room.

I used to think it's a part of what makes me unique and it sometimes is a blessing, feeling more joy and being a lot more in the moment is a lot of fun and has built me a lot of lasting connections over the years. But I have come to realize with my medication that flattening out the highest highs have also flattened out the lowest lows. I prefer the stability now because for every headbanger song or tear of joy I shed there were usually 2 or 3 instances of breaking down in public, calling into work because I couldn't get out of bed, or yelling at someone unintentionally for something relatively minor. It wasn't sustainable and I'm happier for it."
Do you guys ever feel a crushing sadness sometimes?,"I remember when I was a little kid, maybe 6-7 years old, watching an infomercial for some paper towels, and the commercial compared itself to another name-brand towel, and the commercial was pointing out all of the things that the other brand couldn't do and how bad it was.

I remember feeling really sad like, ""why do you have to trash someone else's towel to sell yours? They're just trying to make a living just like you!""

I was relieved to learn as I grew up that all paper towels are manufactured by the same 5 mega-corporations and it's okay to shit on all of them because all of those corporations are trying to rip off consumers and pay their employees starvation wages.

What a relief."
Do you guys ever feel a crushing sadness sometimes?,Yeah. But today is Friday. We don't let that happen on a Friday.
Do you guys ever feel a crushing sadness sometimes?,"Yes. I try to see it as compassion. Sometimes it feels like my heart will burst. The key is to let it wash over you, but dont dwell in it."
Do you guys ever feel a crushing sadness sometimes?,"I do. Probably why I'm so isolated even tho I crave connection and community. There is too much pain out there, that I can't do shit about."
Do you guys ever feel a crushing sadness sometimes?,Yes.
Do you guys ever feel a crushing sadness sometimes?,Yes I do. I'm ADHD and on the spectrum as well.. it's hard to explain. I don't necessarily feel sad because of my life situation or anything - it's more about the situation of the world and others. The other day I killed a rat with a rat trap in my apartment and I had to journal for a long time to get over it. I also had to give the rat some bread before it passed away. I know other people doesn't give a shit about this kind of things. It's good to know there are other people like me.
Do you guys ever feel a crushing sadness sometimes?,"YES  
hopefully a natural part of being human"
Do you guys ever feel a crushing sadness sometimes?,"I think it's because the sections in our brains don't communicate properly. For normal brains, I think most emotions come gradually so they're not that overwhelming.

But for us [and for me specificaly!] it's like I don't remember what emotions are until one of my five senses gets a trigger and ALL the emotions is felt at once.

It's like a dam breaking but it's breaking because a guy threw a rock at it.

After I got therapy I'm able to see what's a me problem and what's a brain-neurons-not-working problem, it can get kinda creepy when you're ambivalent to neurochaos and don't have control over it, but you learn to accept it eventually. 🤷‍♀️"

Do you guys ever feel a crushing sadness sometimes?,"That happens to me particularly when I hear a dog whining because it got hurt or because it just didn't get what it wanted. My sense of empathy gets turned up to maximum and it drives me crazy, especially if I can't go to where the dog is to help comfort it. Weirdly enough, the same does not apply to people, because when I hear people upset, particularly children, I just get very annoyed."

(Is it because I empathise with its lost potential? Haha) Just ... little things like that. Elderly people alone in the supermarket. Animals just so smart and vibrant but their families lost interest in them & they go for walks just looking at their phones, dragging the dog along. It hits me really hard.

"ADHD/Narcolepsy Meds not working anymore, making me more tired? Dexedrine","I talked with my primary and my new sleep doctor, neither of them feel comfortable increasing it which makes no sense to me because it is a starting dose. I’m gonna see if my psychiatrist will take over managing my meds bc i can’t live like this any longer. Thankfully, ADHD & Narcolepsy are treated with the same meds. 

It’s just absurd how hard it’s been for me to try to get help, I don’t know why but it seems I always find the worst doctors. And I’ve been diagnosed with adhd for 8 years and multiple sleeping disorders for 3, hypersomnolence for 5. I tried getting help for the ADHD when I got diagnosed but then I got super sick & just came back to trying to get help for both issues about a year ago. 

Thanks for the information, hopefully my psych will help me.."
"ADHD/Narcolepsy Meds not working anymore, making me more tired? Dexedrine","100% have your psychiatrist manage those medications. Your regular doctor is being ridiculous. For narcolepsy, the starting dose for Adderall (and Dexedrine too, I think?) is 10mg off the bat.

I’m so glad you found something that works for you. I hope it’s a simple fix with the dosage and you can go back to feeling great. :)"

"Moving from Dexedrine to Vyvanse, how much longer does it take to kick in and how much longer does it last?",Vyvanse didn't work for me.  *shrug*
"Moving from Dexedrine to Vyvanse, how much longer does it take to kick in and how much longer does it last?",Vyvanse was my 2nd drug for adhd and i loved it but my insurance wont cover it. It lasted for me abount 7-8 hours at 10 mg
"Moving from Dexedrine to Vyvanse, how much longer does it take to kick in and how much longer does it last?","It’s just dex as far as I can tell, but with a delayed onset. The 10-13 hour statement is because of the half-life of dex which is 12 hours. So 30mg lisdex is 10mg dex, and will leave 5mg still in your body after twelve hours. 

I get comedowns after peaking, so around 5 hours after taking it and get fuzzy. So I need multiple. 
When I use normal IR dex its exactly the same amount of hours minus 1. Which makes sense. 
I still like the comeup better from Vyvanse though, its smoother and the comedown less harsh. I think if the comedown is something you can get used to, sure it’ll last 12 hours.  But the same would be said for an equivalent dose of dex in the morning"
"Moving from Dexedrine to Vyvanse, how much longer does it take to kick in and how much longer does it last?","How much do you take, how much do you weigh?"
"Moving from Dexedrine to Vyvanse, how much longer does it take to kick in and how much longer does it last?","So in your experience Vyvanse is identical to dex with an additional 1 hour added to the onset?

It would have the same effect on sleep for you as taking dex an hour later?"
"Moving from Dexedrine to Vyvanse, how much longer does it take to kick in and how much longer does it last?",Yes it would. If taken in the same dose. 70mg Vyvanse (the max) is 20mg dex at once. 30 is 10mg. My sleep has gotten better after a few weeks. But my sleep always was bad so it just returned to the normal state.

Who knew there were sooo many hours in the day?? Started meds n very shocked at this.,"This relates to why I always hated a lot of overly simplistic productivity/self-improvement advice that emphasizes maximizing every hour of the day. The implication is that everybody can simply just efficiently use every last bit of available time, which really isn't the case, as is made obvious when you compare meds vs no meds. And that's on top of other factors, like how tired you are from work which is a big one, or knowing what you plan to do and getting started on it right away (which is helped a lot by medication as well). 

Off meds my day is just a monotonous blur of derp. I've taken weeks off of medication before and just five or six hours back on medication ends up being more productive than the entire time off."

I've only been on meds for a week now, but my days seem so much longer/more even-paced. I can actually get things done in the three hours of work before a meeting instead of feeling like three hours isn't enough time to do *anything* but scroll. It's like, without meds, just knowing I would get disrupted from my task by the meeting would make me annoyed, so I avoided the task altogether?

Doc tried a different med and I hated it (can't remember why), doc changed it again and I didn't get any better.  Lost my coping mechanisms but didn't get the clarity and focus needed to do my job, so I got off meds altogether. 

I hate that doctors just guess what meds and dose you get and it's trial and error.  I don't have a year or more of trial and error time to get the right prescription.  So I just do what I do.

Working as machine operator and foreman, unmedicated I'd fail at doing all minor tasks related to maintenance and filling all minor forms related to the product.

A good moment for these didn't exist, except that the problem was that all the good moments for these things went by without me noticing.

It is really nice to have found this group and meet people like me, it makes me feel less weird and part of a tribe or something like this. I have a problem, any advice would be grateful ;) I started with 18mg Concerta, the effect was not strong enough so I moved it up to 36mg. Here it works well but I am struggling with 4 side effects: loss of appetite, slight insomnia, sweating, bruxism. The one that is really a problem I cannot manage is bruxism, cause I am killing my teeth and getting nervous. Working I am much more productive/constant, but once It is done I also feel I have lost the enthusiasm for becoming better. Pre meds, anything was not good enough (perfectionism, I used to swam a lot on a regular basis), but now everything is good enough, so I do not do sport cause I am not motivated to become better. I certainly suffer less, but at a cost of feeling less (more lineal). I was wondering if it could be a slight zombie effect due to the med dosage being too high? Would you try 27mg Concerta?"

Its alot to take in but once you are there, you manage."
Who knew there were sooo many hours in the day?? Started meds n very shocked at this.,"Haha, yes I felt the same way when I started the medication. It's because you're less anxious in general, more in control of the time because you know that if you want to focus you'll get it done, so less procrastination caused by anxiety and creating more anxiety. 

The only thing I suggest you to be careful of: even if it feels that you're in control of the time and less anxious, don't postpone anything because of that. Otherwise, you'll find yourself rushing at the end to get everything done (and this will bring back the anxiety ; although, with this type of anxiety, you won't realize or feel the same symptoms. Also, make sure you eat and drink water even if you dont feel like it. I set up an alarm for me to force myself to eat and drink."

It doesn't cover my Dexedrine prescriptions (I have 2 for different doses at different times of day) but it does cover my SSRI. 

I think its weird they pick and choose which psychoactive medications to cover or not cover. You would think that expensive medications like stimulant meds for treatment of an executive dysfunction would be covered because they are an essential medication to those who take them for functionality purposes. 

I have additional insurance through my husband's work so I only pay the tax and dispensing fee on my prescriptions now, but before that it was $165 to refill 3 months of SSRI and one month of dexedrine 15mg and one month of dexedrine 5 mg. Now it's about $30."
Who knew there were sooo many hours in the day?? Started meds n very shocked at this.,"I work overnight shifts, so I had the choice of trying to figure out whether I'd wake up and go straight to work at like 1AM (similar to the average 9 to 5er's morning routine), or embrace my natural inclination to be fully nocturnal and wake up in late afternoons/early evenings, do whatever I need to do (or just have fun/relax) for 5 - 7 hours, then go to work, and then sleep immediately after in the late morning.

When waking up and going straight to work, I'd still be groggy, meds would take time to kick in, I'd be a little grumpy from not getting to relax or enjoy myself upon starting the day, and I'd come home from work too tired to do anything. Whereas when I went to work after having the time to enjoy myself or do anything productive that I needed to do (like exercise, read, etc), I was already riding the momentum of the day and I was in a good mood because I had already did all the things I felt were necessary to have a good day. And it was easier to crash and fall asleep right after work because I had already been awake for a while.

It's a really weird schedule and it's probably not optimal to be fully nocturnal (I use a light therapy lamp upon waking and blackout blinds when trying to sleep, lol), but it's the only thing I've found to work for me."

Who knew there were sooo many hours in the day?? Started meds n very shocked at this.,"I’m more mad at myself for waiting so long. I know my anxiety and emotions masked my ADHD growing up. They just thought I was emotional and talked a lot. Then as I got older I always associated ADHD meds with studying/school, so once school was over I dismissed them. It wasn’t until looking into it for my daughter that I realized I checked most of the boxes and just how bad I am.

I had no idea how much a diagnosis/medication would change me (for the better) in so many things in my life. My children’s early lives were of me being full of anxiety and anger. I couldn’t even focus on my thoughts. Messy house and unorganized schedule. Social life was nearly non existent.

On 27 I have started to behave more... non-ADHD. I just finished an hour long webinar while making notes and I lost track only twice (huge thing for me). I feel tired after 9 pm, albeit I am still working on actually going go sleep when I feel tired. 🤣 I sleep very deeply. I can think of something and start doing it without making any effort. For example today I thought I need to prepare our family calendar before schol starts and few minutes later I found myself with all the necessary equipment ready to start, and I actually went through the whole year of events with only one 5 min. break (the task took 45 minutes). I can manage an amusement park with my kid without becoming a banshee and actually enjoy it. I can control my impulses better.

On the basis of only my personal experience (plus the people around me) I understand why they might limit short-release stimulant medications because I personally can’t imagine them being more helpful - I.e. have enough trouble taking my medicines every day at the correct time when the dosage is just once a day, I don’t think I’d do well taking having to take adderall several times a day. And if it’s ‘not really that helpful’ (because it’s difficult to stick to correct use) I can understand why you would ban it and in that case less access and abuse of short-release meth may be helpful for reducing stigma. But I assume that there must be some benefit for those that take adderall that they don’t get from long-release meth-based alternatives? For anyone who takes adderall, is it a matter of side effects with other medications and do you not find having to take it more than once to manage symptoms with some consistency a challenge?"

Who knew there were sooo many hours in the day?? Started meds n very shocked at this.,"France is an odd one. I know they do have a lot of the same drugs available and they can prescribe them, but they socially veiw ADHD as a social disorder as much as a brain chemistry disorder. 

Because school in France is much more heavily involved in children's lives from a young age, following le Cadre from chreche (children start school at 3 in france) to l'universitè, they treat ADHD in behavior and structure first. They have made some incredible strides with it too! Rejection sensitivity is lower in French children with ADHD because they are included with everyone rather than being separated to deal with their disorder and being singled out. 

They focus on strategies and path ways for non-neurotypical brains to learn, and they eliminated homework for all children with any kind of learning disability with a focus instead on doing the work while in a structured environment to best help them. 

My cousins kids both have special needs, and her older boy absolutely has ADHD but they hold the diagnosis until they test them a few times over the course of their young life. They test all the kids starting at 3 years old to check their development and develop custom learning plans where needed. They don't want to designate children unless they have to and even then they veiw medication as a last resort for extreme cases."

Who knew there were sooo many hours in the day?? Started meds n very shocked at this.,"That sucks and I'm sorry that it's so expensive! It's ridiculous, like charging insane prices for insulin. It's a required medication. With insulin I know it's different because without it you may die (type 1 vs. type 2 etc) but it should be considered as essential as an SSRI for treating clinical depression, or like antibiotics that you only take when you need them. 

The difference being that we need our medication daily and regularly to function from its benefits, unlike antibiotics that you only take as need for a prescribed period.

Our prescribed period for our meds is our whole damn lives! We can function alright ish without them, but with them is better in every way for people like you and me.

My favorite example I gave my doctor recently, that had her laughing so hard she almost cried, I can do the dishes and it doesn't make me want to punch myself or someone else! She said I always make her day when we have appointments because of my progress and my attitude.

Well, not really, but I get really annoyed and I anger easily. Anywhere with masses of people and noise is bad for me. At least used to be.

When they gave me that the doc would just give me crazy amounts and ask how it made me feel, I think by the end of high school i was taking like 12x30mg pills every morning.

Who knew there were sooo many hours in the day?? Started meds n very shocked at this.,"Ah I see! 

It does have a pretty awful stigma of being abused by people who don't have ADHD for sure. I've seen people abuse Dexedrine too on occasion because I guess for people without ADHD it's a lot of fun to take stimulants and party. I've had people ask me for my meds when they find out what I take, and I always refuse with one exception. One of my besties has ADHD and takes the same prescription, and if she runs out before her refill and needs to work I will give her one of my pills but that's as far as I go. 

A friend of a friend who is a nurse has been known to procure stimulants from the pharmacy at her hospital on occasion. I was shocked to find out how incredibly lax the pharmacies at hospitals are for medicle staff btw. She brought them to a party I was at and she and her friend proceeded to snort the powdered dexedrine that comes inside the spansule, same one I take but she had 30mg capsules which I have never seen before. I take 15 daily and tried 20 but found it way too much for me. 

I left not long after because I am not down for that kind of party. They are nice enough people but I draw a line on abusing prescription medications, a hard one. I had to prove how responsible I was to my doctor before she would give me 30 days at a time for my meds.

Who knew there were sooo many hours in the day?? Started meds n very shocked at this.,"Well that depends right? 

Dexedrine spansule, what I take, is an amphetamine but it's doesn't contain meth, it's just amphetamine. The spansule is a time release formula that lasts 6-8 hours. 

Adderall XR is a time release formula, and again does not contain meth. Meth isn't an ingrediant in any ADHD treatment that I know of. Amphetamines are a common one though!

Unless you are referring to Methylphenidate, which is the other common ADHD drug, also known by its original name of Ritalin."
Who knew there were sooo many hours in the day?? Started meds n very shocked at this.,"Sure. 

Caffeine is a stimulant, like coffee or tea that most people drink to give them some get up and go in the morning. For 70-80% of ADHD sufferers stimulants of any kind will have the opposite effect that they will in the brain of a person who is neurotypical. That means for a large chunk of people with our disorder they self medicate with caffeine if they can't afford medication because it makes them calm and centered and focused rather than hyperactive and energetic. 

Also quite a few people unknowingly self medicate with caffeine before they are diagnosed and start proper medication to help them out.  

There are 2 stimulants that are known to be especially addictive to people with ADHD because of self medicating before diagnosis, those are caffeine and nicotine. Also sugar addiction runs rampant with ADHD lol!"

I take Dexedrine and dexedrine has a pretty big stigma as well! Most of the pharmacists are chill about refilling my prescriptions, they follow the law or course but they don't judge me. They do warn me about interactions and side effects but that's it. There is one pharmacist I hate that's an older lady and she always makes me answer this inquisition when I get my prescription about why I take this and weather or not I really need it and suggesting holistic alternatives like raw honey?!?!?!? 

One time about 6 months ago she even called my doctor to ask her to confirm my prescription because she didn't beleive that I needed 2 different prescriptions for dexedrine for different dosages and release formulas.

Who knew there were sooo many hours in the day?? Started meds n very shocked at this.,"Yeah, sometimes it just takes a few tries with a good doctor who listens to find the med that works best. Titration. 

Sometimes it's the combination of a particular drug that works or won't work. Like amphetamines come in a bunch of different combinations for long acting or short acting, Adderall XR vs. Adderall. Dexedrine too, dexedrine sulfate is fast acting with a shorter effective window, dexedrine spansule is time release over 6 hours.

I also take a long release amphetamine-based medicine for my ADHD but I was just interested in whether anyone has found the short-release alternatives to be preferable and whether that is because of side effects or other factors. I’m specifically referring to those that prefer adderall not adderall XR.
Who knew there were sooo many hours in the day?? Started meds n very shocked at this.,"Ritalin and Concerta are both brand names for methylphenidate, where Ritalin is an instant release form produced by Novartis Pharmaceuticals and Concerta is an extended release form produced by Janssen Pharmaceuticals. The capsule design is what makes Concerta extended release, which is why you can’t crush or cut the capsule and expect it to work the same."

Who knew there were sooo many hours in the day?? Started meds n very shocked at this.,"Actually sipping it does something to my brain where I'm super motivated for a short time after drinking. So usually I try to get super into a task whilst slowly sipping coffee and my hope is that by the time the coffee is finished, I've reached hyperfocus and can continue for a while. But if I'm feeling demotivated, the coffee finishes and I have nothing to keep me at my desk and carry it on!"
Who knew there were sooo many hours in the day?? Started meds n very shocked at this.,"Ah I see! Thanks for clarifying! I got really confused because methamphetamine and amphetamines are very different beasts lol!

I can kind of answer that questions, I take Dexedrine sulfate as well as spansule. My doctor prescribes a 5mg bumper dose to help me sleep. 

It's weird how they can have the same effect but at a lower dosage the sulfate is more immediately effective, where the spansule at a higher dosage works for the time release I need. I can tell when they are working and I can feel the effects come on more gradually with spansule, but with sulfate it hits more fast and hard, if that makes sense? 

I wouldn't want to take just sulfate as a medication because I prefer the long acting spansule for effectiveness over time, but when it wears off and I need just a 3 or 4 hour window it's pretty great!"
Who knew there were sooo many hours in the day?? Started meds n very shocked at this.,I thought the extended release was due to the capsule design read somewhere that they are laser drilled. Ok did research on it there 22% of the dose is in the actual coloured coating and 78% is in laser drilled holes that release it depending on the amount of water they absorb. Basically makes sense as an extended release method but leaving them soaked in water would have same effect as crushing them from what I read.
Who knew there were sooo many hours in the day?? Started meds n very shocked at this.,"Oh it sounds marvellous in theory, and I'm very interested in learning more about it. 

Being undiagnosed until middle age, I've realised I'm going to have to learn and unlearn a lot - and I've already spent the past 10 years consciously trying to improve various areas of my life without realising what the underlying issue was. Their approach also sounds great for avoiding all that nonsense, as well as perhaps self-fulfilling prophecies of childhood diagnoses and messages of 'you have this therefore you can't do x, y and z'. 

I think it would be doubly great if they had provision for adults who didn't go through that process, and maybe strategies to research that their theories are correct longer into life. As I come into peri-menopause, for example, symptoms have really been intensifying. 

But it's an interesting approach and I'm really pleased you shared details! Thx"

Who knew there were sooo many hours in the day?? Started meds n very shocked at this.,"Damn man, I feel for you. I mean, if that's ever motivation enough, just know that Quebec is a great place with lots of career opportunities and friendly people. We get lots of hate because many Quebecers have a strong reaction to people moving here without trying to learn our language, but if you partake in the culture, it's a super welcoming province. Many people just don't realize the sheer amount of Canadians from other provinces who move here and actively refuse to embrace the culture they chose to live in, or even proudly hate on it.

It may not be in your plans at all, but I'm letting you know, that door's definitely open and people here are friendlier than they are made out to be if you just learn to understand them.

Kinda went on a huge tangent here, but oh well. Quebecers are like vegan, we just HAVE to let you know about our culture lol"

Who knew there were sooo many hours in the day?? Started meds n very shocked at this.,"Well they’re the same - methamphetamine is just a chemical within the amphetamine family, but yes the potency is very different. All of the amphetamine-based drugs use amphetamine to combat the dopamine dysfunction on a cellular level it’s just a matter of how bioavailable the amphetamine is - i.e. they sticks bits onto the drug to make it require more metabolism (and so a slower release). Whereas the amphetamine in methamphetamine just has a methyl group (CH3) stuck to it so it produces larger and faster effects.

So do you take a lower dose so it doesn’t interfere with your sleep and a bumper to make it more affective during the day? Obviously that makes a lot of sense as an appendage to a long release treatment, I might try it hahah."
Who knew there were sooo many hours in the day?? Started meds n very shocked at this.,"I take 15mg spansule in the morning, and 5mg sulfate at dinner time or in the evening. 

I actually take the lower dose to make me sleep lol! Without a stimulant in my system I can't get to sleep easily. I'm part of that 70-80% that has an inverse reaction to stimulants so stimulants are basically a sleeping pill for me when I take them in the evening. 

I've had chronic insomnia my whole life related to ADHD. One of my friends with ADHD too, she is even in a medicle journal as an anomaly that they later realized may be a predictor of ADHD in children. She didn't sleep for the first 3 months of her life and her mom dropped her off at the hospital for observation because she thought she was going nuts. Nope, sure enough she didn't sleep. They kept her for 3 days and watched her. She micro napped for 39 second at the longest interval but was awake and hyper alert for an infant the rest of the time. 

It turns out for both her and myself stimulants are what regulate our sleep. We need a dopamine push to regulate our circadian rhythm."
Who knew there were sooo many hours in the day?? Started meds n very shocked at this.,"Ahhh yeah that makes sense. Wow that poor mother hahah you would definitely be like shit I think I broke my baby. 

Does it make you sleepy or just facilitate getting to sleep? I can fairly easily sleep during the peak of my medication so it doesn’t really stop me sleeping but I am more lethargic without it and am prone to falling asleep where I shouldn’t (i.e. at at least 3 jobs 🙄) so I would definitely say it helps me to stay awake when I need to. So it makes me wonder whether it’s kind of balancing you out so that when you want to sleep you can or reversing the inability-to-sleep if you get what I mean? Honestly adhd brains are so interesting, I’m surprised there are aspects of it that are underresearched.

Thank you though for replying I completely forgot the backwards stimulant reaction was a thing and that’s a really good example of when you might find that short release stimulants are preferable to long release."
Who knew there were sooo many hours in the day?? Started meds n very shocked at this.,"Also do you know if she was getting enough of each cycle of sleep then if she was only asleep for 39 seconds at a time? (I.e. REM sleep and slow wave sleep etc). That’s so interesting, it sounds really disruptive though."
Who knew there were sooo many hours in the day?? Started meds n very shocked at this.,"I know right?!?! When she dropped her off the first thing she did apparently was go home and sleep for 36 hours! Her mom was a really cool person. I never got to meet her myself, but I know her through my friends stories and pictures and my friend her self of course! 

It does both for me. I can choose my focus so I can choose to do things like start the routine I do before I go to bed. Once I start that I am a creature of comfort and a completionist so I will do my whole hygiene and face stuff routine because I don't do things by halves or without enough energy to exhaust someone who is neurotypical lol. Just because my brain takes extra steps, so it's extra work I mean 😄!

I actually get time blind sometimes when doing my night time routine when I don't take my meds, if I can even force myself to do more than take care of my teeth. It's a problem when I realize I've been sitting in the bathroom on reddit with a face mask that's been dry for half an hour. Oops!

You are spot on about how it reacts in my system! It balances the dual sides of my nature to be even and consistent. I can choose my focus, I loose my time blindness, I can organize and execute my routines efficiently! I think of my brain like a computer  processor to help me understand it so please forgive that last peice of phrasing 😆

If I try to go to sleep without a stimulant of any kind in my system, I toss and turn and am awake and full of energy in my head but can't get comfortable no matter how exhausted my body is. My brain doesn't shut down until I exhaust it or trick it with watching YouTube videos that don't require any higher thought processes at all, or just feed it some stimulants. It's actually really funny to me how well it works because if you tell someone you take a quick release amphetamine as the best sleeping pill you have ever tried... just priceless!"
Who knew there were sooo many hours in the day?? Started meds n very shocked at this.,"Yeah it is really wild! I have found the journal once in the archive at my old university, but I'm not sure if I would be allowed access as an alumnus and not a current student. I should do an online archive dive and see if I can find it again because it was really wild to see it! She told me about it so I went looking because I lived in the library of my alma mater, roaming the stacks for weird old books lol!

She was getting enough sleep if I remember correctly, as it wasn't harming her healthy in any way, she just didn't sleep like normal infants who are usually asleep for most of the day unless eating, crying, or just watching the world. She would go into rapid intense REM for seconds at a time and then be awake again like she never slept. She would wake for between periods of 3-8 hours at a time, then fall into a deep and immediate REM cycle, then wake again. 

They hooked her tiny little infant head up to an ecg to watch the wave function and see how the pattern developed and it was a very dense line with long high-low spikes but extremely fast! Also notable that the wave evens out back to normal very quickly at the end of the cycle with a complete return to wakeful baseline, rather than a slow or gradual shortening of the wave as the brain wakes from restful sleep. 

Additional interesting note I remember the doctor making in the journal was that she could not be awakened when asleep without painful stimulai being applied. He thought this could mean that her brain was possibly over producing adrenal hormones but her blood work was normal so he he wasn't sure what the cause may be.

Later on after she was diagnosed they drew some conclusions from it but it's still very tenuous because she is one person who reacts one way and that was a long time ago."

advice on ritalin and Dexedrine,Maximum daily dose according to both the Australian Therapeutic Guidelines and noted in the Australian Medicines Handbook are up to 60mg immediate release methylphenidate within a 24 hour period and up to 80mg if using an extended release formulation. The FDA here in the US also has the max recommended dose as 60mg. That has always seemed a bit high to me personally but it's not unheard of nor is it unreasonable according to medical literature. Seems more like it's your docs personal rule
advice on ritalin and Dexedrine,"Lmao change your doctor. He has a personal bias. 
I had a similar situation. I found a great psychiatrist that didn't gas light me and took everything I said into account. Smoothest experience I've had psych related. He puts me on Strattera. I thugged it out for a month, lots of side effects, nothing positive. Report back to him, he goes on a rant about how he hates stimulants and prescribing them. Didn't attack me personally but I could tell my treatment options with this doctor ended there. 
Found a new doctor, put me on Ritalin, showing success now. Never be afraid to switch a doctor."
advice on ritalin and Dexedrine,"I find it bonkers he said that was a high dose. I work in pharmacy and not too long ago I had filled a Rx for a kid that was taking methylphenidate ER 36 at twice daily. I fill plenty for adults that take a high ER A.M and then IR in the afternoon. Clearly I’m not a doctor here, but it has me curious what he’s basing his standards on?"
advice on ritalin and Dexedrine,"Thankyou. Great to have it confirmed. The doctor's advice just put me off balance, like 30 mg a day was extreme. From what I've read 20-30 mg is an average dose."
advice on ritalin and Dexedrine,"Thanks, I'll take your advice!"
advice on ritalin and Dexedrine,Doctors who hate stimulants have never had to live with ADD. They should all fuck off.
advice on ritalin and Dexedrine,He must just have a personal issue with it then. He was quite condescending. It seems hard to find good doctors that deal with stimulants (at least I'm Australia).
advice on ritalin and Dexedrine,"Yeah, I'd completely understand if a doctor said that they personally don't like to prescribe higher doses or some reason that they don't feel it's necessarily right for you, but this sounds more like just a lie, or possibly just misinformed, neither of which would fill me with confidence in a doctor"
advice on ritalin and Dexedrine,"Love this comment too! Makes me feel better, and almost certainly going to change my doc"

Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"I scrape by, I thought I was doing OK but it turns out I’m basically useless and don’t deserve a wage."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"Your mom forcing you to be on weight loss drugs, sucks.  That doesn't make medication prescribed by a doctor, which was developed by scientists who dedicated their lives to helping people with your condition, from around the world for over 70 years of scientific research, bad.

You're clearly scarred from the bullshit that happened to you, but if you let that make your life even worse, that's very sad.  

Right now, you're metaphorically hopping through a forest with 1 leg, looking down at a crutch, and saying ""I choose to hop"", instead of using the crutch.

There are more ADHD medications out there than just stimulants, though stims are the best for most individuals.

Anyway, that aside you have to structure your life, build routine, develop habits, study ADHD, learn about your condition, experiment and create positive adaptations that work for you, and do about 1000x other things, but none of them are as effective as medication.

Though even with medication, all of those things are still necessary, they're just 50% easier to accomplish with medication."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"I almost downvoted you because there are a shitton of resources how to deal with ADHD. Doesn't matter whether you are or aren't on meds. Meds doesn't magically solve everything, and you still need to work on....well everything. 

You need structure, sleep, good food, family, friends, exercise, meditation, a planner etc. etc. that applies if you are and aren't on meds. 

Also, whether drugs work or not is not determined by whether or not you were ever forced on (too much) Dexedrine. I understand that leaves a bad taste in your mouth, but its not a rational response to then disregard all and any drugs at any dosage."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"I functioned for years without drugs, but it was completely pointless and I made life way harder by doing it. Meds are easily the most effective way to deal with ADHD. Nothing comes close to the effectiveness of meds, and I have personally tried just about everything. Theres no way I’d be where I am today if I didn’t switch to my prescribed meds. It is absolutely doable to live life without them, but it’s definitely making things harder for yourself and you might not reach the heights you could reach with the right meds. I wouldn’t let past trauma stop you from being the best version of yourself. You don’t have to be on Dexedrine, there are many other meds out there that could help. If you were sick with an infection, you’d take your meds, if you had depression, you’d take your meds, there’s no reason to treat adhd and it’s meds differently. Theyre one of the most well researched drugs on the planet. Again, you absolutely can live life without them, but personally I felt like I wasted so much time and set myself back after years of doing that. Once I got educated on how adhd works and how the meds function that’s what convinced me to finally get a prescription and try them out."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"I live without drugs and what works for me is the understanding that my brain needs much more variety and sometimes even strange ways of doing things in order to get them done. 

For example:
I used to rarely brush my teeth because it is boring and many times I couldn't bring myself to go to the bathroom just for that. So I decided to make it not so boring and now I have a toothbrush in the bathroom, kitchen and next to my bed and I brush my teeth wherever the nearest brush is. I have also once challenged myself to brush my teeth on every piece of furniture I own. I have sent the ""toothbrushing diary"" videos to my friend who wanted to help, we have also started speed competitions to see who can go brush their teeth faster if we wake up at the same time. 

Someone could think I'm crazy or childish because as an adult I can't just brush my teeth ""normally"" 
but I don't care because this works for me. You have to find ways that are suitable for you and motivating enough to make things happen."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"As someone who went without meds for a long time after an ADHD diagnosis...I truly get where you're coming from, but I wouldn't close the door on it completely. There are non-stimulant options, and while my Strattera journey hasn't been perfect, it has helped with a lot of things. My ADHD has gotten a lot worse in recent years, and I just couldn't reject medication anymore.

**That being said, find a great therapist who specializes in ADHD.** Therapy was the only reason I could function without medication for years, in addition to using applications on my phone and computer that block the most distracting applications (mainly social media)."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"I’m high-functioning and have never tried meds. I have a nice life - great family, high earner, active and healthy. 

But I don’t recommend going this route if there are options. I’ve been too worried to try meds but it’s such an irrational position that I can’t recommend it for others.  I’m playing life on hard mode and very frequently disappointing myself and struggling when it might all be very unnecessary. Don’t be me if you can help it, I guess."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"I struggled to get thru ADHD life for 52 years without prescription drugs. I felt like me being me was good even if I'm a little crazy and I don't want my brain chemistry altered. I refused any antidepressants also. I came up with lots of coping mechanisms and workarounds. 

When I could not drink excessive coffee anymore because my prostate doesn't like it, I lost my ability to complete basic tasks. Coffee worked for me to a degree for decades and is really just a legal drug. When I contemplated that I've been 'altering my consciousness for years' already I considered trying prescribed medicine. I like it. Adderol fixes some similar and some different things for me than caffeine. I won't take as much as prescribed, I take the minimum I can to get some effects and it helps but does not ""solve"" all my issues. If I take too much it does not feel good. 

I think ADHD gets easier to deal with as you hit your prime as an adult and just like other prowess fades as you get older your ability to cope suffers too. Maybe you can get by til later in life without meds? Maybe you will never use them? I sometimes wonder if I would have been more successful in life (not just financially) if had used them sooner."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"I've had significant periods of my life where I was medicated and where I wasn't since I originally was diagnosed. It's been my experience that the drugs ""turn down the noise"" so you can think more clearly but you still need to manage your condition like you would without them. There's a whole spectrum of severity with ADHD too so it's gonna be different depending on the individual. For me, when I wasn't medicated, sleep, diet, and exercise were crucial but I also tended to self medicate with caffeine for work and alcohol socially and those worked against the benefits of the healthy habits.

Can you manage without drugs? Maybe. Lots of people walk around every day either denying or not knowing they have ADHD and they live their lives. That doesn't mean they might not have an easier time if they sought treatment. 

My recommendation would be to try it for a bit and evaluate how you feel. I didn't stay on antidepressants long term but being on them for a bit changed my life because it helped me recontextualize my thought process and made it easier for me to identify when I was spiraling. You don't necessarily need to be medication-dependent for the rest of your life to benefit from them."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"I think this question was asked many times. The only advice I can give, is don't let the one past experience be the only thing to guide your decisions. And I strongly advise to not think of it as drugs, but to think of it as medication. For me it's choosing between living on adrenaline or living on medication. I can hype myself up and gamify stuff or compete or make myself really stressed and scared and do stuff amazingly well and fast without meds. I have. And I ended up pretty much burned out and hating the things I found important. Meds don't change me at all as long as I take them as prescribed, they just make the adrenaline unnecessary. I can just brush my teeth now without having nightmares about my teeth falling out forcing me to. I can just clean the house without having to be afraid of my boyfriend leaving me. I am much more relaxed and feel more balanced. I can always choose whether or not to take my meds on a daily basis, so even if you decide to try, you can always decide it's not for you at a later time. And if you don't want to try, the only thing that worked for me was gamifying stuff, stress and fear."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"i thought i was getting medication today, turns out that won’t be happening anytime soon…

there’s a severe shortage so i don’t think ill be getting any, it’s a bummer because i thought it would help my in school but i’ll probably be in college by the time i get it."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"This can - in part - depend on gender as there’s a relationship to hormones/estrogen fluctuations and adhd symptoms as ADHD is different for AFAB than AMAB. 

A longer answer is that it can be complicated. I’ll add: for most folks who find the right medication/right dose it can feel like a whole new life! 

Don’t write rx off 
and also 
do REAL research on likelihood of addiction to stimulants (if that’s a worry) with an adhd brain - it’s *almost* impossible to become literally addicted to a stimulant with adhd as it levels out the brain (vs non-adhd brains that might experience some spiked feel-good sensation I guess.) 

You may become dependent in the same way someone becomes dependent on their diabetes medication. 

The right med at the right dose can be life changing. 

None of this is a complete answer by any means just some things to consider :)"

Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"I mean, I can survive - do just enough at work, sometimes shower/brush teeth, sometimes run laundry and clean dishes - but I wouldn't say I'm really ""thriving"" or living my absolute best possible life.

Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"I was recently diagnosed and I have not been prescribed medication.

Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,[deleted]
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"Before I was diagnosed, I was living pretty well without meds, but it required a heavy duty amount of therapy and living an extremely structured lifestyle that eliminated a lot of my patterns that were at least correlated with my ADHD because I didn't have room to engage in them. The benefit was that I didn't use meds. The downside is it didn't leave a lot of room for fun and I was constantly exhausted. That said, once the ability to maintain control over all that structure happened (COVID brought about a lot of changes), I ended up on meds because I could not gather together the threads to create a new, highly structured life and that's where the meds helped. You probably can carry forward without them, but if it turns out you need them down the road talk to your doctors on the front end about your concerns and see what they have to say."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"I went off them for various reasons. One being the challenge in obtaining them from various pharmacies during shortages. I also felt like they created a physical dependence. And eating consistently felt impossible many days. There was a curve to go off them, but I haven't looked back. 

I will say there are challenges on various days. Some tasks were made easier by ADHD medication. However, it stopped feeling worth it to me. Some days, the meds helped, and other days, it felt like they made things worse or more challenging for me. 

What works best for me is a consistent workout routine, positive outlets, lots of self-awareness, discipline, and a good support system. Finding fellow ADHD friends who understand the way your mind operates helps a lot! 

No meds may not work for everyone, but if you find you can get by without them, it's worth giving it a shot. Ensure that you are meeting proper nutrition and sleep needs and build a routine as best you can.

I also would learn as much as you can about how ADHD plays a role in YOU. Everyone is different, and the more knowledge you have about the why's behind your behaviors/patterns, etc, the more successful you will be in tackling those without medication."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"I've been on drugs for my adhd before. I stopped in the middle of my senior year of high school. I'm 5 years out from then and managing just fine, full time job, part time online school working towards my Bachelor's. I learned the coping mechanisms I needed in order to do what I wanted to do, which is why I stopped taking them, and am still doing ok.
When you're medicated, the goal isn't to keep you on these meds, the goal (at least from what my doctor told me, could vary case by case) is for them to help you by, and to learn coping mechanisms while on them. That way you may function to what capacity you yourself define as acceptable without needing the meds again. 
However, there are more medications available which are not what your doctor prescribed you before. You may have to do some testing, you might luck out on the first medication picked.
Just understand there is no miracle drug when it comes to this kinda thing. We who have adhd have a chemical imbalance in our brain which makes it work just a tad differently, and certain medications will correct that imbalance, but throw other things off balance. And that's normal. 
I hope things turn out well for you, OP."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"I manage, but it’s tough. I meditate every morning to calm my thoughts and put them in order, use lists…lots of lists. And do short work spurts then take a break. Do anywhere from 10-25 minutes on a certain activity on my list…take a 10 minute break, then do another short burst on a different activity.

And therapy!!! Weekly therapy!!!"
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"I was off meds for 18 years. It can be done but it’s HARD. I learned everything I could about the condition and modified the way I did everything for years. However when you’re doing something difficult, like a demanding job, or your life situation gets hard, think financial troubles. It will be very very hard. I often fell into depressions so deep it would take years to come out again, I would blow my whole life up and half to start over. I felt like a failure for not being able to do something millions of people do without issues. As long as you’re on the right dose of meds it’s not going to do anything but treat you, it doesn’t feel like drugs. In fact I tried alternatives for years and boy the side effects were horrible, it was a nightmare for my brain chemistry. I understand not wanting to medicate, I’m sure your doctor will be able to go over all of the options. Express your fears, there’s many options. 

Getting back on meds was the best thing I’ve done for myself. Ironically so many of us stayed away from meds due to our family. I wish I would have done it sooner."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"It really depends how much/ little impact adhd has on your life, and how limiting you feel by it.

I am prescribed medication, of 3x 20mg a day, I always take my morning one, otherwise I feel like a zombie all day, buy i often skip one or two later ones depending on how much work/ focus I need to use during my days. 

I take medication on my days off when visiting family and friends, as adhd seriously affects my emotions and the inability to regulate them. Hence, I'm more collected and calm when having conversations, etc. 

You have got to really get to know how and to what degree it affects you.

Now, medication won't help you in planning, organising, finishing tasks etc. You have got to put in the work, with or without meds."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"I don’t like how meds make me feel, and I also have some baggage about pills after my cancer recovery over a decade ago. I avoid them wherever possible. So here’s how I manage some stuff. And if you want to know how I manage something specific, feel free to ask!



I set lots of alarms (especially for deadlines). 

I use a lot of lists (ones by my computer for work/games. One by the fridge for groceries. And I’ll text stuff to myself, so I know to check there too).

I removed several pile places and only put a couple in key places (by the front door, for example, where keys and my wallet go…I don’t do purses because I lost too many of them by setting them down and forgetting where I put them). 

I got rid of a lot of drawer storage (it’s actually surprisingly easy to figure out what I have and where it goes when I can *see* everything)."

Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"Try the medication, see how it works for you. Personally, I got too many side effects and didn't feel that different. I just felt anxious and got extreme erectile dysfunction. So now I go by my life unmedicated. But I have a job and education so I get by. However, people still find me obnoxious as fuck due to my adhd unless I'm masking. It is what it is."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"Why get tested for ADHD is you refuse to take the medicine to help you? It seems you have a nasty view about stimulants like rest of the world. I can quite literally go to sleep sometimes after taking my adderall because my mind is just calm and at peace. My life has done a complete turn around after I started taking my meds consistently, I have them to thank for the life I now have. You can’t really train yourself to not have adhd, also, it doesn’t seem like we just grow out of it either. I need my stims to live a normal life just  like a diabetic needs their insulin to live their life. 29 years of living like this, and medicated for 13ish years now—I realized that I happened put my clean/dry underwear in the dryer this morning with my shirt. After going upstairs to get another pair. I thought to myself “my underwear doesn’t need to be de-wrinkled wtf” then realized I forgot my sock upstairs"
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"Fully understand your approach to this issue.

Most important thing is to be educated about adhd. It helps me in daily life. It's easier to see adhd behavior and try to counteract. 

I can't take stimulants and didn't want an SNRI oder Wellbutrin. So my options were limited. 

What works for me is guanfacine / intuniv. Nice side effect, it lowers blood pressure, too. No other side effects so far. However, it took time to be effective. Now I notice less phone time. Better concentration and less forgetting things.

Wishing you the best!"
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"I managed all of school through university with no medication but it's only because I was self-medicating with large amounts of caffeine. Taking my medication now means I have stopped drinking energy drinks, and the medication is just so much more effective as well. 

I can't even imagine how much better I could have done in school if I had the proper medication and diagnosis earlier in life."

He utilizes pallets, calenders, and phone alarms. He writes everything down. My house growing up had big whiteboards in the kitchen so that we could keep track of tasks and errands easily.


That being said, I know he wishes he'd had meds when he was younger. School was an awful struggle for him. He did well for himself in the end, but I know he has regrets on what could have been. "

Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"I'm not medicated. 

Here's what I recommend.

Get the audiobook of ""why Buddhism is true"" by Robert Wright.

Next, develop a way to deliver information to your future self. I use gmail and calendar.

Filter what you allow into your life and what you pass on to your future self. So much of life is meaningless. Mindfulness will help with that. Another audiobook to get is Steve Hagen's ""Mindfulness Now or Never"".

Reduce variables with habits!

Every day for me is the same except for what the universe throws at me.

Sleep, work, eat, exercise, meditate.

The only difference between weekdays and weekends is that I work for myself on weekends instead of working for my job."

If I didn’t have my husband to take care of me I would probably need to be on something."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"I think what helped me best aside from medication was drinking coffee and frequent exercise. Gave me focus, motivation, and energy that I severely lacked."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"Not sure what to tell you except you're going to need to break through and fight that trauma, because there is nothing as effective as medication. You can apply all the coping strategies and still fall short of what could be possible with medication. 

This is not a healthy way of seeing medication and I understand that this is a struggle most people won't even understand, but you have to be strong and get the courage to break this distorted view, because it's both unhealthy and now causing you to skip on medications. I can bet my paycheck this trauma is causing you other issues in your life as well or will cause them in the future, so this is a thing that you must sort out."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"Most resources say take them because for most people, they're neccesary. There are other things you can do, but they're way more effective if you're also on medication.

Dexedrine is sometimes prescribed for ADHD, but there are lots of other medications - and besides that, the dose you're taking makes a huge difference. Let your doctor know about your experience with Dexedrine (and the dose you were on, if you can remember it) and the can try a different kind of medicine instead."

Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,Without Adderall? No I can't function without my prescribed ADHD medication.
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"Naturally it depends on your severity. But treating severe cases of ADHD starts with medication. I've been on both sides of the spectrum, from high functioning in my youth to severe ADHD today. In my case without meds as a starting point there is literally no amount of willpower or counseling or coping strategy which will help. At all. It's all a complete waste of time without the medication as a foundation, and the repeat failures when I tried just reinforced failure and depression in my mind, making everything worse as I slipped further and further behind.

If you have ADHD and need medication then the goal should be a dose that makes you feel normal. Not high or numb or unlike yourself. In my case I am not me without my meds. I'm some sad depressed zombie who cannot get out of bed. I'm still trying to find the ideal dose, but with my meds I'm alive again, for at least part of the day. I'm me 12 years ago, not a zombie like today."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"Yes there are but i don't think this sub is the right one for that.

Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"Not all medications are the same.
It's worth it to try the other ones, maybe the the next is gonna be a life changer, if not you will have wasted a week at most since the meds start working within minutes, if you have a bad reaction stop it.
Just don't limit yourself because the first one was a bad fit.
Don't worry, adhd meds are some of the most studied and most safe drugs we have. 

Also, the studies show therapy is as effective as medication for adhd, and the best result is medication + therapy.
It's mostly about finding ways use external tools for organising yourself and helping yourself notice the bad though patterns."

Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"You are assuming this persons cognitive ability based on the average ADHD experience which differs from person to personality and from environment to upbringing.

I do not take medication regularly and I in no way metaphorically see myself as crippled. For me it’s sometimes like weights on ankles other times like I’m running too fast.

Yes medication is an easy effective option but it’s best to allow people to understand how they can fit it into their own life’s rather than being pushed as the default option without even explaining the rest or allowing the person to understand their brain.

This is what I find most frustrating about the diagnosis process. You get the diagnosis and are given medication. Nobody explains your weaknesses and strengths. No one explains how your brain works. Then maybe you come to point where you’d like to reduce dependency which is completely fine, but you have no tools, no mechanism to manage with medication. Or there’s a shortage and people have no fallbacks.

It’s great that there’s medication for ADHD but it being positioned as a solve-all is concerning."

I suppose not rational, but at this point in my life I have a fear of drugs unless to safe the life. I went through too much when young and still dealing with fallout from some of them."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"In my experience none of those help
Structure: Is only in the way, i can't handle appointments, i just want to sleep, wake, sit at pc and when I'm comfy that's when i consider swapping to house clothes, but usually it's already 4pm by that time. Then i try to brush my teeth but i finish in 1 minute because 2 is excruciatingly long. Then i try to eat something for breakfast but forget usually then it's already dinner time. I only really start to do productive stuff like watching a studio ghibli movie at 4 am but i collapse asleep, can't even finish one anime episode at 3.5x time speed. 

Sleep: I sleep way too much, 8-9 hours and I'm mad at myself for always sleeping through alarms just to try to wake up during rem to remember a dream. I force myself to stay awake but fail because i only start to think about being productive when I'm tired and stop doomscrolling.

Good food: mom cooks hello fresh so i know there is nothing wrong there

Family: 90% are dead and the other 10% is way too busy

Friends: Terrible experience with those. Had one but he moved to Spain, and I just lost a friend yesterday because i didn't have my phone in my hands for 24 hours and she went no contact because of it (it wasn't even time sensitive). I'm happier alone honestly because every time I'm with friends they talk about basic crap and it wastes my time because it only makes me happy for ten minutes. 

Exercise: I don't even know how to do this without feeling like I'm wasting time. My vacation goal is to try to finish baldurs gate 3, my first videogame completion in 2 years so any time not in front of my PC is wasting time but i keep getting the urge to Google random stuff I'm half interested in out of worry i might forget. Exercise is the last thing on my mind the vacation is already speeding by..

Meditation: I can't even sit still for 1 minute brushing my teeth and I already do a lot of introspection but considering i see myself as a 100% rational machine with no emotions, none of my political opinions can be contested by even ai. I have long discussions with AI and we always end up agreeing. Example: Make a wish is rationally the worst charity to give money to as it contributes nothing to humanity as the people the money goes to pass away and the money just ends up in celebrities pockets.

Planner: I already put all the important stuff in my calendar but it just makes me stressed"

Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"Hahahhha, that’s an unusual way of doing things. Perhaps brushing your teeth is just something you don’t like doing because it’s boring, that’s what I do.

Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"I was doing really good until I quit coffee. Can't go back. Now it is actually ok. I forget stuff, if I don't write it down, I am lost etc etc. 

The main thing I am having trouble with is social. I can't seem to formulate thoughts and talk the way I did after a nice cup of coffee. Thankfully half of our social group is ADHD or Autistic or both!

I had a  now x friend, who actually should have been an x friend over two years ago, say something really mean to me. She has been sarcastic and subtly mean for two years. Been aiming it at everybody. We just excused her as she has had a terrible time with her life. Some her fault, some not. 

My takeaway for the rest of my life, is I don't care how bad a time they have had, don't be mean to others! I don't want to know them."

Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"How am I possible saying anything about cognitive ability?  I have said nothing on that.

I never said anyone is crippled, I used an analogy to make a point.  Analogies are things that parallel a situation so that you can convey meaning through an imaginary scenario.  Edit - Metaphor, I guess.  Not analogy.  I don't know which it is, but either way, it's not to be taken literally.

I did not say medication is the only option, I cited the efforts of scientists and humanity over a long history trying to help people with our issues, as being a good reason to give it a shot.  If you think nobody should ever try medication, good for you I guess, but that's not my position.  

I think everyone should try medication, because it helps the vast majority of us, which is why we take it everyday despite wishing we could just snap our fingers and be better.  We can't, medication helps, if you don't use it, that's your decision.  

If someone tells us they're against using it, not because they tried it before and it went bad for them, but because their mother forced them to take weight loss drugs and it soured their view of medication, then I think it's a good idea to try and open their mind to taking it.  I did not say you must take medication or else, I said here's why I think you should take it, but you also need to make life adjustments.

Some of us need it, and this person may very well be someone who truly needs the help.  Even if need is an excessive word, it helps a lot of us significantly, which is what I mean by the word need.

I don't disagree that doctors should emphasize more of the personal adaptations necessary for dealing with ADHD.  I did, in my post that was a big point, I even specifically said whether you have medication or not you need many adaptations and named several.  So I explicitly made the point that it doesn't solve everything."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"You seem to have issues that you’re working out that aren’t very helpful in the way that you are expressing here. Your comments about the inability of the medical community to tailor treatment to the individual is valid but speaks to much bigger issues about medical care here as well as everywhere else on earth unless you’re wealthy enough to afford concierge type care. 

The fact that the medication exists is a wonder in itself. ADHD as well as many other conditions unfortunately require a lot of personal research and effort."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"Therapy alongside medication is the most important thing you can do. I hated medicine but now after using it routinely and then wavering off of it, i feel in control even off the medicine and just use it as a pick me up certain days i lack motivation  (never use it to just wake up, youll crash hard the next day). So yes, abusing medicine is not good, but not taking it isnt good either, not that ive done either, bit you need to tailor it to your own path, the other redditors here are too one size fits all oriented to appreciate your concerns which are valid. The doctors in their fields are specialized so if you go to a psychiatrist they cant give you verbal instruction on how to cope with your issues that they may even contribute to, thats why therapy exists.

 I hope you can feel a reduced amount of pressure knowing youre not alone , and that medicine is just a tool, not the solution, you are the solution. 

Also one thing many on here dont mention is that Adderall CANNOT be taken daily! In a week dose you must skip 2 days out of 7 to avoid drug toxicity and your body becoming dependent on it physically (not psychologically). So jobs that have people working 6 days or 7 days a week will not fit into that time period of Adderall allowance. Which is also why i believe Adderall is a tool to help you focus when you cant, so that when youre off the medicine, your brain has built up resistance to being off task and more strength and value when youre focused on tasks."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"I didn't say that. I have not used meds for 40 years, I'm fine-ish. 

I am taking Ritalin daily, but I might stop at some point again. I don't see it as a requirement, but it seems to help, so why not?"
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"Fwiw, stimulants meds do increase your lifespan. ADHD reduces your lifespan and the meds pretty much normalize it. But I suspect that's not what you mean. 

In any case, that's not a healthy outlook no matter what the drugs are for. If you don't want ADHD meds at least see a therapist for both the ADHD and the medical fear and trauma. You're going to have problems come up, one way or another, and this fear of meds does nothing good for you"
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"I don't know how you are feeling in all that. I've been diagnosed late. So I'm very much in control over the whole process, and I do not feel forced at all. 

And still, drugs are scary. Especially if they can / will change your personality. It's a whole identity crisis if you think about person A taking drugs, and then becoming person B. But you can write stuff down, how meds really affect you. Take more subtle dosis, try more stuff. 

But you can do it without, I did that 40 years. And I also invented a lot of coping strategies on my own which I now see when people give ADHD tips.

I have the same respect towards friends, I try to make them, but they’re always a waste of time. Or they’re lazy, no productivity. Or they’re trying way too hard to control stuff. And it’s like dude cut that out.

To that end, I'll add that meditation and mindfulness has been pretty helpful for me, personally. I'm not a religious or spiritual person, but being able to observe my own thoughts and feelings without feeling the need to act or identify with them has definitely helped me find my footing in times of stress."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,">I do remember she always made me take them with dinner.

Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"Zoning out. I have found a way to not zone out too much on telephone conversations.

But it kept me from zoning! 

Don't talk on the phone much anymore except  with teh person who started all this. I would play solitaire. If I didn't I would zone out. 

She got offended when she found out so I tried to just listen to her. Known her for 40 years. She has been through a lot, not all of her own making. It did not go well. It didn't help she had no interest in hearing about anything about me. I knew that but kept cutting her slack with her digs and sarcasms. She was aiming at everybody. I knew several people had stopped talking to her. I should have done it earlier and not letting it blow up."

It really does feel like I was given the shit stick of life.         

But thank you for enlightening me. I always had a feeling that I wasn’t just standardized ADHD, because both of those lists I can see myself in, in the combined sense. And I really just I don’t know, perhaps my existence was a mistake."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"Anyways, I found that my ADHD medication’s do work substantially, but then they start generating problems. When taken long-term or at high doses, Which is why I want to try a non-stimulant approach but my insurance is giving me a hard time about it though"
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"Yes even Dr. Russell Barkley who is widely quoted and respected here has said medication and CBT is the most effective treatment. Many people are not given the opportunity to learn about CBT and implement it and I feel most of the narrative around meditation does not help with that.

I have seen people say medication is like glasses or a wheelchair, but for me, it’s not that I can’t see well, it’s that I see differently, it’s not that I can’t walk well, it’s that I walk differently.  I can see what the average can see but I perceive it differently. I can get from point A to B but I might take a different route.

Rather than it being a case of “Can I do this?” it’s usually “How can I do this?”. And hence medication becomes one tool and not a complete adaptation.

If my ability is attached and dependent on the expectations of the average then by all means I am crippled.

If my ability is what I know and understand it to be, then I recognise I must live life according to my ability. And in this case my medication becomes a tool and not the holistic solution."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,Could you please share a source on that Adderall claim? I have never (in the 17 years since I was diagnosed) heard that from a single medical provider or pharmacist.
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,Please drop the article the demonstrates that stimulant meds increase your life span. I'm curious on what physiological factors they accounted for I'm their analysis!
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,How do stimulants increase your lifespan when they’re supposed to have cardiovascular issues?
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"ADHD **may** reduce lifespan if left untreated. It does not by default reduce lifespan. That’s an extreme claim. Stimulates do not increase lifespan - they are just one effective tool for treating ADHD.

There are behavioural comorbids with ADHD but it by itself is not necessarily a threat to life.

There are millions of elderly people around the world who never even knew they had ADHD and likely still don’t. In fact only 20%-30% of adults even know they have it. There are countries that don’t even recognise it. It won’t make logical sense to say ADHD is directly in all cases life threatening. It’s a sweeping dangerous claim to make."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"When I’m not on ADHD medication’s, and people tell me to write notes I’ll forget to write those too, I always, always always always always forget something.

Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"For sure, thank you again."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"this was a wholesome read and made me feel better, I'm going through a similar situation. thank you for your kindness"
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"And that's why they deserve to know more than anyone that it doesn't always go like that. If they think of it as crutches instead of glasses, they could be setting themselves for some real uncomfortable shit. If they turn out to be the sort who needs meds to hold their life together, your statement sets them up from failure."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"Learning you have a condition and how it impairs you blows, no doubt.  Still, before I knew I had ADHD, I just thought I was fucked up.  When I learned I had ADHD, I realized ADHD is fucked up, not me.  I saw a lot of forgiveness for all the ways I thought I'd spent my entire life fucking up.  Of course I'd have the same struggles everyone with this condition has.

When you're fighting an invisible monster your entire life, of course you're going to struggle.  Also, as an aside, most folks with ADHD are often the combined presentation, but adaptations can change how you present, because many things can be adapted to.

Learning I had ADHD was a struggle, and the first year is harder, but usually, after you know what you're up against, you are able to adapt to it.  It takes a while, but eventually you can strategize past most of adhds problems.

I was far more impaired 2 years ago when I figured it out, than I am today, and I didn't find out until I was 34, which is why I already had a lot of life adaptations, also my job fortunately made addressing some of my problems mandatory.  

Anyway, it sucks to figure this stuff out, but that's step one to adapting to your condition.  I highly recommend the book taking charge of adult ADHD, and the book atomic habits, they're the most valuable information that can help you make positive adaptations and minimize your impairment."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"Your response contains logic. Cbt is what helped me thoroughly but wasn't entirely possible without medicine. I'm prescribed 20 a month, and the standard Adderall pamphlet included tells me why i can't take it every day of the week and have to skip 2 days. I was diagnosed last year so I'm learning quickly."

""ADHD medication initiation was associated with significantly lower rate of all-cause mortality  and unnatural-cause mortality, but not natural-cause mortality""

This one is dominating the web right now because it's new

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5539840/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5539840/)

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25158998/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25158998/)

Car accidents and substance use disorder are the biggest causes of excess death, both of which are reduced by meds.   
  
It's also just much easier to care for your health when you're treating adhd, but I don't have any study for that which I've been able to find at the moment. Diet, stress levels, exercise, for some people sleep schedule, when meds work they allow you to improve all this stuff. 

Also Russ Barkley says as much pretty regularly but I don't know which studies he's necessarily pointing to. He says regularly that the lifespan benefits outweigh potential minor cardiac risks. And also since untreated ADHD carries an increased cardiac risk, it's a little hard to disentangle the causes."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,Sure I'll go find it. I believe all-cause mortality goes down pretty significantly in exchange for some modest cardiac risks
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,There are a number of studies that have been done that all show the same results. [Here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1087054718816164?journalCode=jada) is one from 2018 by Dr Barkley.
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"well to simply put it, unmedicated people with adhd are more likely to get into car accidents, overdose on drugs and get into trouble. being medicated reduces these risks significantly"
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"You underestimate the risks of ADHD, and you overestimate the cardiac risks of meds.

Untreated ADHD is deadly, full stop. The cardiovascular impacts of meds are smaller than the impact of ADHD. That besides, untreated ADHD carries significant cardiovascular risk all on its own, and treating ADHD allows people to treat the underlying causes of the cardiovascular problems. You're never going to fix shitty diet and exercise without executive function, and meds help improve your executive dysfunction. (Not the only way to improve EF, but a pretty effective way)

The cardiovascular impacts need to be considered of course, but since these meds are taken under medical supervision, your doc is always watching your BP and treating accordingly. The impact exists, but the general understanding of their severity is outsized."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"It reduces the average lifespan of a sufferer dramatically, that's just the facts. Nobody knows if they're on the lucky or unlucky side of the average except in retrospect. Individuals living well doesn't change anything; it actually demonstrates how dramatic the effects are that the average number is still dragged so low by the most tragic cases. Meds are a numbers game, and you're giving yourself the best chance by going with treatment."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,I'm more likely to forget things when I'm on meds....  sooooo our mileage varies by a lot :P
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"Sure!        

But just remember our mental health problems will most likely create thoughts in our heads that we are a waste to each other‘s time. Even if we aren’t.         

I did poke at your profile for a quick second and it looks like your in a place. I’ve always been curious to visit, but I’ve heard some pretty mixed stories about it."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"Theoretically, offering any advice that isn’t exactly how their ADHD works for them sets them up for failure, but it certainly sounds like they don’t want to rely on meds to keep their life from falling apart. So rather than saying meds are the only possible solution, I showed some light at the end of the tunnel. I offered an alternative option that will still take alot of work, but will also make the hardest part easier, figuring out what ADHD is for them. All the while, they can see how the different meds work for them. If/when the meds turn out to be glasses rather than a crutch, they can manage accordingly. However, it ultimately comes down to what they as an individual want/need to do concerning their ADHD."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,You’re being unnecessarily pedantic. Commenter was helpful in their suggestion of a valid option that may work for OP’s specific problem.
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"They only prescribe you 20 a month? My adderall prescriptions have always been for a full month. I’m not saying you’re lying, but I think your doctor holds a minority opinion on this topic that I have never heard from a doctor (or our favorite internet adhd doctor Russell Barkley)"
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"That’s just an abstract. And how do you count for people with hypertension? Psychostimulants literally, irritate, hypertension, and there’s plenty of ADHD medication’s that do not have stimulant properties."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,This is not exactly true. ADHD is life threatening if it is left untreated not unmedicated. There is a difference.
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"Interesting because of the risktaking behavior aspect, I do see myself participating in those things far more often than not. But sometimes I can literally look at a situation and not participate, because I already know the ramifications.          

At least someone finally spelled it out though. Putting it into perspective for me."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"How was untreated ADHD deadly? My diet is poor because of my binge eating disorder, although I have noticed my going to the gym steadily declining, but that was long after I stopped taking my ADHD meds, it was mostly because I stopped taking my antidepressants. But I still try to go at least three times a week, albeit not really enough, but it’s better than not going at all.       

Perhaps you’re understating, the cardiovascular effects of psychostimulants.         

A lot of my providers now won’t even prescribe psychostimulants anymore, due to the fact that I have hypertension. Although it is ponderous, if I have hypertension due to the fact that I have large staghorns in my kidneys right now.          

When you say executive dysfunction, is that implying the inability for proper care and maintenance of my body, due to my illness?"
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"Yeah, it’s very interesting, when I’m on my meds I’ll usually remember as I’m in the car, when I’m not on my meds, I’ll be driving down the street halfway away and then remember. Sometimes I’ll get all the way to the destination and then remember that I didn’t have the item I needed because now I cannot access the destination.            

Sometimes I sincerely feel like my existence is a mistake."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"My psychiatrist and therapist stated that Adderall builds neural connections if you build a routine and follow it for at least a month, that even off the Adderall you will want to stay in the routine, which is honestly true. Ive followed their advice and went from barely being able to get out of bed, to starting the day early, even without Adderall. But proper sleep schedules, nutrition the previous day, and getting rest is the most important part if i want to start my day correct the next day."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"Yes...i can send you my bottle via dm and the instructions. Its not recommended for your heart to take it daily. They had me take it like this in new york, and i was diagnosed there. The medical imsert included quotes about the risks of dependency. When i switched psychiatrists i stopped Adderall for a year then got back on it and the instructions were the same. I live in a new state so its not that either."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"My pharmacist tells me the same thing even when its a new pharmacist. Theyre not affiliated with my psychiatrist, plus they read the pamphlet given with Adderall xr and it states it can cause side effects like mania, high heart rate, high blood pressure, increased sweating, etc if prone to those conditions. They always read those before giving me my medicine at cvs pharmacy or any pharmacy i pickup at. This isnt new info im bringing, other on this subreddit have stated they want to take the pill every day, but their dr tells them its not recommended. But you went 17 years ago, maybe ask about new research...i was diagnosed last year when i was already struggling during my college years due to untreated adhd symptoms (I would never focus in class and constantly talk yet was still able to be top of class by overworking)"
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"You can access it on Google scholar for free. This study says one of its limitations is that it does not account for blood pressure and heart disease, among other things, and the oldest participants were in their early 30s so not old. Mainly white men. So not too not helpful with my question.

Don't get me wrong, my adderall is a must for me to function, but the low possibility of cardiovascular disease (when accounting for the fact that I'm polypharm), and shitty healthcare makes me concerned."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"It's not just an abstract, the abstract is just at the top... the full article displays on the page I see, AND there's a button just above the abstract for a PDF version if that's your preference."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"ADHD is a disorder of executive function. The part of your brain that flips the switch between 'have a thought' and 'get up and go do the thought' is the disordered part of the brain. Any action that you don't find fun and interesting on its own is harder to do with ADHD. For most people, yeah, it makes health maintenance harder. Some people like to cook or enjoy the gym. Some people manage to get there anyway. But it makes everything that much harder. 

I mean I'm talking about the studies, I don't know you and can't speak to you specifically. If you're already hypertensive yeah, it does complicate stimulant meds. Our cardiologist said he 'doesnt know of any cardiac conditions that would disqualify you from stimulant meds' and that he is willing to treat through hypertension if it should turn up, that's no help to you obviously. Comes down to the doctor. 

Have you asked about guanfacine? It should treat ADHD and also lower BP. Idk that one too well but maybe that could help"
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"Your value as a person isn't determined by how good your memory is. You know this, as you wouldn't say the thing you say to yourself to someone else, would you?

So, apologise to yourself!

Anyway, I got a million systems in place not to forget stuff. Medication on my iPhone is nice, also works on my Apple Watch. And I always make sure to have the log button open and ready to press when I put meds in my mouth. Because sometimes I need to check my phone/watch whether I took my meds.

And I always have meds on my keychain.  My phone willl give a high priority loud alert after 30 minutes if I had not registered taking meds. So I can't really forget. I'll take them wherever I am at that point. Toilet, car, bike, escalator, inside your mother. Doesn't matter."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"Ok, and I’m telling you that in California I have never once been told I *can’t* take my medication 7 days a week or been prescribed less than a full month’s worth. My pill bottle literally says “one capsule daily.” Again — not trying to say that your personal experience isn’t your personal experience, I would just be careful about stating something like that as an objective scientific fact (bc as far as I can tell, it isn’t.)"
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"Since you’re the ADHD expert, having been diagnosed last year, you should know that almost all of us have to see our doctors monthly to get our prescriptions. so yeah, I went 17 years ago (when I, like you, was diagnosed in college), and I also went literally last week. The hubris in your comments is really rubbing me the wrong way."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"That’s what I am primarily worried about. That’s why I’m trying to get on an ADHD medication, that’s not a psychostimulant. I do need to be on some sort of ADHD medication because all I do is lay around all day and sleep. I try to get as much done as I can, but I just don’t have any motivation."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"Yeah, that’s called intuiv and it’s a weight gainer, and it does work, but I’m not going to gain weight to treat one disorder and then beholden to another. But that medication does work, you’re right. I wonder why when I read your comment, when I read anyone’s comment, I start by responding to the last sentence.              

I really want to get on Qelbree but my insurance is making it quite difficult to do it.

Also, how does dyslexia and ADHD coincide? Or is it just comorbidity because I have that great of luck?           

I noticed that I also flip words around, not just numbers. For instance, I’ll say “what are those finning spans supposed to do?” Instead of “spinning fans” and of course you’re already familiar with dyslexia of numbers. Instead of 123 West Main Dr., I’ll see 231, or 321 Or 132."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"Ask your doctor next time because this is new research. I've had other friends as well tell me they were advised to skip 2 days of the week on xr, but you can stay ignorant of the new data being brought to the table."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"Youre the one claiming im stating things as fact that arent when they are indeed facts. My bottle states take for 28 days (4 weeks) and skip 2 days every week(90.2f) qty :20 ct AdderallXR 10mg. Theres no hubris, just your judgmental point of view to someone who has learned something different. My point is, if you don't believe me ask your doctor in 1 week and confirm not everyone can take it daily. Or stay ignorant because this is my 4th comment and you still havent gotten away with your snarky attitude. My op comment/reply was poised to help others feeless insecure in their different approach to  medicine, then you come and tell me my comment shouldnt be stating things (of my own experience) when this is all data ive acquired through learning in the internet and through my experience with doctors. Im not sure why the attitude. Im just correcting your mistakes about my reply, with my own advice for you to ask more sources."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,"I take 40mg Adderall (30XR and 10IR). Non-stims did nothing for me tbh, but everyone's body is different. My main concerns stems from the fact that I take like 7 other meds and never had any blood work or an EKG done before hand. Several of my meds outside of Adderall impact my heart in some way or another, and is why I'm tapering off all except for Adderall. 

Generally speaking, Adderall and other stimulants are safe for most people with ADHD. But I've never read a study on long term use (ie: starting as a minor and continuing to take it for 60 or 70 years) which is a concern of mine."
Is there anyone who manages without drugs?,I've heard Russ Barkley say there's a correlation with ADHD and dyslexia and dyscalculia (the name for dyslexia for numbers). But tbh I don't really know why. I sort of dug hardest into the parts that affect my family so I never really chased that thread. I think they just happen a little more often together than apart.

Dexedrine SR twice a day??,"For me i can take it when ever, but I can also do the same with Vyvance. 

To start out with, I think you might be better off taking 2.5 at 4 times over the day.
The biggest thing for me is that starting out I could really feel the ups and downs, so I would take 20mg Vyvance which stops the roller coaster feeling. The Vyvance on its own, even up to 70mg was nowhere near as effective as even 15mg of Dex. Even taking 2.5g of Dex you can feel it enough to know when it’s wearing off and to take the next dose. If you take them too much too close together, it’s like a bit of an overwhelming feeling and at least I couldn’t concentrate. With taking 2.5g more often it was easier to control, and get it to work effectively and not even feel like I’d taken anything which is what you should be aiming for"

Im just about to ask for Dexedrine IR. Did you get the same sort of crash from Dexedrine that you get from vyvanse?"
Vyvanse vs Dexedrine??,Did you switch to Dex in the end?
Dexedrine: Canada vs USA,I’m from the states and I’ve never even been offered Dexedrine by my provider. She’s pretty liberal with trying meds and it was never a part of our discussions.
Dexedrine: Canada vs USA,"Canadian provinces negotiate bulk prescription drug prices with manufacturers, resulting in significantly lower costs to consumers on many different drugs.  In the US, the free market dictates pricing."
Dexedrine: Canada vs USA,"Not sure why Dexedrine costs more than Adderall myself, since Adderall contains the same active ingredient as Dexedrine, along with other amphetamine salts, and comes in more strength options than Dexedrine. I'd think this would make Adderall cost more than Dex but 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️"
Dexedrine: Canada vs USA,"I took generic dextroamphetamine for a couple of years, and I loved it as well. Brand name Zenzedi is even better. I'm gonna guess that your doctor wrote a script for Zenzedi, because the generic Dex I was getting was $80 with my insurance, and like $120 with GoodRx, and $400ish cash price. Brand name Zenzedi was ~$100ish with GoodRx, $700-800 cash price, and not covered by my insurance. 

Dex is also a lot harder to find in stock at most pharmacies, and Zenzedi even more so. I guess that Dexedrine was really popular here back in the 50s and 60s, and people abused the fuck out of it, so now it has more of a stigma for being something that people are gonna get high on. 

I ended up switching back to Adderall a couple of months ago, just because it's so much easier to find it in stock, and I can get my 90 tablets of 20mg IR for $20, instead of $80 bare minimum for the Dex. 

It kinda sucks, but it is what it is."
Dexedrine: Canada vs USA,Goodrx is your buddy. https://m.goodrx.com/dexedrine
Dexedrine: Canada vs USA,"That’s what I noticed. My Primary said he would give me the script for it but he has never given it to someone before. It just seems strange that it’s so widely popular in Canada while Adderal isn’t. Especially since I think Dex is far superior since it 100% affects mental whilst adderal is 75% mental, 25% physical."
Dexedrine: Canada vs USA,"Hmm interesting. It’s just curious that even brand name Adderral, Ritalin, Vyvanse is significantly cheaper than Dex by 5-10x."
Dexedrine: Canada vs USA,Did you see the prices? lol Still $700/month
Dexedrine: Canada vs USA,"And even basic and more common drugs like Insulin - the provinces negotiate with the drug manufacturers and if they can’t come to a reasonable consensus on cost, then that drug is simply shut out of that province’s system."

Concerning the high dosage by milligrams that you’re prescribed daily, to what do you attribute it, if known? Was wondering if you had you developed a high tolerance to stimulants over many years being prescribed them, or if perhaps you’re an ultra-fast metabolizer of amphetamines."

Wellbutrin 300mg in mornings as well as Clonidine 0.1mg morning/evening.","The adjustment was slow to try and find a balance, even with dexedrine holding the works up the Concerta still caused a low mood by late afternoon. Not sure if the dexedrine just runs right through me so it wasn't there to cushion the blow as I didn't try to offset their timings. 

This current dosage I'm at is about nine months now however there was some time where I was on it prior, but then we tried Vyvanse so it interrupted that time, not sure how long before we tried Vyvanse that I was on this dosage. Foggy on that. 

As for the high dosage and what to attribute it to? Not sure, best guess between me and the doc is that its not lasting as long as most people get. 

So the current scheduling and dosage has been kind of more or less built around that. 

1x5mg IR at waking at 7ish, bout an hour later take my 45mg spansules,  by noon I take another 5mg IR then at around 2-2:30 I find is the best time to take my next 45mg 6-7pm the final IR and that's the day.

No problems falling asleep. Nope, wouldn't say I have a high tolerance as Vyvanse kicked my shit in sometimes which is weird because it's the pro-drug so sorta shouldn't be any different. 

Shitty brain chemistry maybe? When completely off all meds for months I ended up figuring out lots of weird stuff. DMT has absolutely no effect on me, we tried it from everywhere and in every form we could. Friends had no problems but I would feel nothing, pharmahuasca, same thing. I can eat an ounce of mushrooms and while I do trip hard as fuck I've never had a bad trip, tried to induce them as an experiment but no dice. I'm also fully in control, cognition not impacted.

Benzodiazepines turn me into the energizer fuckhead. Paradoxical effect I guess.

Gabapentinoids get me stoned as fuck. Small doses too. It's bizarre. A little pregabalin and I'm floating on sunshine. Doc couldn't figure that one out so we just figured it was better to leave it alone.

Wellbutrin and this amphetamine dosage should be pushing me to the limit of dopamine-flavour country but eh. 

I turn down any opiate painkillers because it's never enough. I live in a city with a huge opiate problem so I understand they give conservative dosages when indicated. My old doc out of province figured out he could trust me when I said I wasn't getting relief at all on dosages like 5mg hydromorphcontin or 20mg oxcodone and stuff. NSAIDs and oxycontin 80mg made injuries bearable. Wasn't a problem of low pain tolerance just seemed any opiate we tried was like taking a flinstone vitamin. No problems stopping when the doctor called for it, no withdrawls and no desire to use them recreationally. 

Who knows my friend. Around 15 years ago I was really into fitness and I did the ECA Stack, which is 8mg Ephedrine, 200mg Caffeine and 81mg aspirin a few times a day. I kept titrating it up and didn't feel any effect until around 54mg ephedrine, 400mg caffeine, even then it felt way weaker than people describe. Barely raised my BP and heart rate. No idea. Did that for 2 years or so.

Speaking of fitness, my weight has not changed on any stim. I've got some padding for sure and when a nurse or doc sees the dosage on a chart it's become a running theme that they ask me if I just started it. Nope. No raise in BP, heart rate doesn't change, not much going on.

Who knows, I have hepatosplenomegaly so maybe it's all down to the liver being a dickhead or maybe I've got fucked up enzymes to go with my fucked up skeleton.

I stopped trying to figure it all out, I figure everybody has their different quirks with medications so it's nothing to worry about."

Dexedrine and ED any solutions?,"It is the vasoconstriction. If it isn't causing issues when you need it, it's probably not worth the side effects of another medication.

If it is a bit 'spotty' as to get it to play when you need it to, Sildenafil (Viagra) or Tadalafil (Cialis) will help since the mechanism of action is literally as a vasodilator. You can't take them constantly because you want to pop boners randomly during the day, constant use will cause issues."
Dexedrine ER vs Vyvanse,"I have Dexedrine ER for studying after my Vyvanse wears off for the day. 

I think it just depends on your body. Also, maybe what you have eaten, how much, hydration, etc. I feel like I am more prone to headaches on Dex than Vyv. I took Dex last night for the first time in a bit and i woke up with a GNARLY head ache."
Dexedrine ER vs Vyvanse,"I've been taking dex for ~25 years and have nothing like what you're describing, so I think you just need another drug. From what I know this is not uncommon! It takes a bit to find a working one for your brain and body.

Dex is ""old"" now and they typically use other prescriptions (at least, this is what my doctor old me). My friend had horrible, horrible anxiety when taking dexedrine but was just fine when taking adderall. Another friend could not take either and ended up on a non-stimulant solution. It was not nearly as effective, but it was an OK solution for her lifestyle. 

So just advocate for yourself: hey, the side effects are too unpleasant. I don't want to continue taking this drug so lets either find another or stick with Vynase."

Dexedrine New Zealand,"Hey there, I'm in Australia but I think we have similar prescribing legislation.

I used to take Ritalin, now taking Dexedrine/Dexamphetamine.

If I were to compare the two, I definitely prefer the Dexedrine/Dexamphetamine over the Ritalin.

The Ritalin worked yes, but I found it was too short acting, and would work 50/50. And what I mean by that, is some days the dose (usually 10-15mg 2-3 times a day) was enough. Other days the lower dose wasn't enough and I'd need 20mg 2-3 times a day, however, this higher dose would make me feel overstimulated, increased my heart rate to the point I could feel it, and I would get headaches frequently.

Dexedrine/Dexamphetamine has been a lot better. The only way I can describe it is like I am seeing in HD. I take 10mg 2-3 times a day, and get about 5-ish hours of effects, which covers my day job and study. I don't get the noticeable heart rate increase, I don't feel overstimulated, and I don't seem to get headaches on it.

It's definitely worth trying yes. Don't feel discouraged if you need to try a few different medications before you find something that suits you."

Questions about Dexedrine,"My therapist actually suggested I ask a friend to try an Adderall just to see if it worked and I wasn’t comfortable doing that, but it’s actually a good thing I didn’t because I don’t have any response to stimulants. That means something else is going on with how my body processes the meds, not that I don’t have ADHD. 

But here’s what I’ve learned from my psychiatrist and my dad (psychiatrist). With fast acting stimulants (Dexedrine and adderall) you need to take 3 days on a small dose to adjust to the medication before going up in dose. So you don’t know with this pill if it’s a good dose to start with. It may also be that you won’t respond to it because you need a higher dose to control symptoms. But stimulants aren’t like antidepressants where you need a month before they start working. And, people who don’t have adhd do respond to stimulants beneficially, it’s part of why college students abuse them, it helps them pull an all nighter writing a paper. So I can’t tell you what to do, I can only say that the way you react may not indicate whether or not you have ADHD."

Questions about Dexedrine,"it honestly sort of just depends. the dose might not be ideal and bodies are just different. i can promise i d e f i n i t e l y have ADHD, but the first few days of taking adderall were kind of insane. i think i’ve seen people call it the ‘honeymoon phase’. Just switched to dexedrine recently and didn’t feel nearly as cracked out but it might have to do with the fact that i was previously on adderall. try to google the shape/color/printed numbers or letters and see if you can find out what dose it is. Do a little research first and be 100% certain it is actually dexedrine. If you feel wired, don’t necessarily write off the possibility of adhd. If you feel better/calmer, then you’re probably right. 

ETA: 
Don’t take the calmness as the only factor and definitely still speak with a psychiatrist."

Tips on how to deal with Dexedrine crash?,"Try get a booster. I dose every 3 hours 4 times so by the time I get to bed the crash hasn't properly started, and my head is still quiet enough that I can sleep easily ish."
"Had a prescription for Adderall, generic/substitutions being fine. Was given generic Dexedrine. Will that work or is it something different?","__TL;DR: the NDC # is the key to unlock what medication you received, its strength, and its manufacturer.__

What is the NDC (national drug code) given on the label of your prescription? 

This is an 11-digit number in 3 sections that uniquely identifies the medication and its manufacturer. 

For example, brand Adderall XR 30mg manufactured by Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S.A. (formerly Shire US) has the NDC #: 54092-0391-01.

I suspect you may have actually received what appears as a generic for Dexedrine Spansule but is actually just different generic / manufacturer for Adderall XR than the one you had previously been taking. 

Further details:

- “Substituted for: Adderall XR” may actually mean that your MD wrote the brand name on the prescription, but allowed its generic form to be substituted and filled

- there are several acceptable generic naming conventions used when substitute for brand Adderall XR, i.e.,”Dextroamphetamine-Amphetamine Sulfate ER”; Dextro-Amphet ER”; “Mixed Salts ER”; “Dex-Amp Mixed Salts”; “Dex-Amp Sulfate ER”… etc. 

- had you actually received a generic substitute for Dexedrine Spansule, the label would most likely read “Dextroamphetamine Sulfate ER” instead, and the line below it would read “Substituted for: Dexedrine Spansule” (or maybe just “Substituted for: Dexedrine”, if your physician actually wrote ‘Dexedrine’ on the original prescription; currently, brand Dexedrine in the US automatically implies the controlled release drug, as the only branded product for immediate release dextroamphetamine sulfate available in the US market today is Zenzedi)

- another simple explanation could be that the generic name for Adderall in your pharmacy’s ERP system could start with “dextro-“ with the full generic name exceeding the available space for printing on the prescription label"

Dexedrine and its side effects,"well talking to a dietician can help you manage your diet more than medicine.....

I am a dietitian too with ADHD😐"
Dexedrine and its side effects,"yeah i used to be prescribed 40mg of dexedrine. would take it first thing in the morning(around 7am). 
 be super productive/focused. then a couple hours later the crash would begin and i would be so exhausted/depressed/anxious and in short i would get between 0-4 hours of sleep a day. and there were days were i just couldn’t eat which lead to extreme weight loss. went from around 80-85kg as a 6ft4 male. to 57kg within about a month.  

I found alcohol was extremely useful for me(TEMPORARILY)as i could fall asleep pretty much 10 minutes after drinking and instead of not being able to eat. i could clear out the fridge with ease. 
Fast forward it around a month and had withdrawals from amphetamine/alcohol/benzos. 

Not worth it at all. Stay safe"

Dexedrine and its side effects,"My weight gain has mostly been because I simply don't get enough exercise anymore. My diet itself isn't too bad. I guess I find with Dexedrine I eat for sustenance rather than pleasure which just means I snack less which I think is a good thing.

I used to walk 20-25k steps per day in the office now I sit at a desk at home. 

Almost all indoor sports are cancelled due to COVID. I've never been able to just lift weights or go jogging. It's so boring I don't understand how anyone can do that. I always got my exercise playing sports or just working and now I can't do either."

I see alot of patients saying this

Dexedrine and its side effects,"In the past 2 weeks I've lost 3lbs so I'm seeing some progress.

I used to count calories with an app. I would weigh and measure and scan barcodes for everything I ate and it worked for a while but you can imagine how hard it is for people like us to keep up that level of effort, at least it was really hard for me."

Is 15 mg of Dexedrine per day a lot?,"No, 15mg dexedrine isn’t a lot. 20mg per day seems very common, and 40mg is usually the upper limit. 60mg is rare, usually for narcolepsy. Similar for Adderall. 

Dexedrine is already an extended-release med, but some people get a longer action from Vyvanse. Dexedrine is actually two doses of dextroamphetamine, one after the other. Vyvanse releases more continuously, based on a totally different release mechanism. 

I think it’s totally reasonable to want symptom coverage that lasts until you’re ready to wind down for bedtime. Our lives don’t stop requiring attention and exectuive function when we clock out at work. 

If dexedrine is working well for you in terms of symptom relief vs side effects, I’d try to stick with it, and just ask for an additional dose to take later. If you take multiple doses in a day just as symptoms start returning, later doses can be smaller than the first, because you still have a subtherapeutic level of medication in you. You might need an afternoon or evening dose of 5mg dexedrine, or if you need the last dose to last half as long, you would take half of a 5mg instant release tablet. 

Vyvanse is great for convenience if it lasts longer for you, but you are more locked in with its timing, and the level may or may not be as good for you, as it releases differently from the way dexedrine does. If the level is good, but you still need it to last longer, an instant-release booster is still an option.

I have used all three, and find them very similar, with a slight preference for dexedrine for my particular symptom set (brain fog, inattention, lethargy). Dexedrine and Vyvanse are essentially the same medicine with a different release profile."

Is 15 mg of Dexedrine per day a lot?,"I am not realizing I may be more dependent than I initially intended to be 😅 I’m on 60mg of Dextroamphetamine Extended Release. I guess I have adhd? But really, if I didn’t take some sort of stimulant, I literally couldn’t function. I couldn’t wake up or stay focused or motivated or remember anything. 
I can get out of bed now if I set an alarm to take my meds and go back to sleep before my second alarm an hour later. Otherwise, I can’t function. 
But I honestly don’t notice much of a difference between 30mg and 60mg so I’d suggest staying as long ad you can in the dosage."
Is 15 mg of Dexedrine per day a lot?,"You nailed it!  Vyvanse is a prodrug that is converted to dextroamphetamine as it's metabolized.  

5mg-10mg of Dex would literally put me to sleep.  I'd be in bed all damn day!  That's kinda how I figured out I had ADHD.  When I finally got a diagnosis, I started at 25mg/day then moved up to 30-35mg depending on work load and stayed there for a while.  Now I'm on 40mg, but I'm prescribed 50mg b/c my pdoc told me to take what I need, so some days it's 45mg and others it might be only 30-35mg.  My pdoc told me that in some extreme cases, he's even prescribed a couple of patients up to 120mg/day."
Is 15 mg of Dexedrine per day a lot?,"Very informative! I usually take Dexedrine at the same times every day, starting in the morning. But I can see the downsides of having only Vyvanse if you want to sleep in or something like that.

I'm going to call my doctor because he didn't prescribe me *nearly* enough to last a month and I'm about to run out what seems like this week... and he wants me to follow up a month from now and I'm realizing I need a dosage increase. 

Thanks for the information!

>I think it’s totally reasonable to want symptom coverage that lasts until you’re ready to wind down for bedtime. Our lives don’t stop requiring attention and exectuive function when we clock out at work. 

Also, thank you for this. I think for most people, ADHD can have negative impacts of *all* areas of their lives. I felt this greatly after being medicated, I didn't realize how I feel the need to interrupt all the time, but now I don't really."
Is 15 mg of Dexedrine per day a lot?,"No man, whatever works for you is great. Idk why I got a notification for this comment, lol. I thought it was a reply to my own, but doesn't show you replied to me at all.

Anyways I just wanted to say if your vitals remain intact, then you have nothing to worry about! If you're getting checkups with the doc and making sure you're all good, the dosage is probably safe. 

Since I started taking Dexedrine, my heart has never been healthier! Lower resting heart rate, generally just lower heart rate, less anxiety, less depression, feeling generally *good* and hopeful consistently. Balancing life a lot more... Idk the list is ENDLESS. I'm just so grateful to have Dexedrine omg."
Is 15 mg of Dexedrine per day a lot?,"When you are on 40mg or 50mg of dexedrine a day, what does your dose schedule look like? Currently I like dexedrine, but I am like you.. 10mg makes me want to go to bed lol. I am currently on 15mg spansules twice a day with an option for a 5mg instant release as needed.. But i'm curious how you schedule for 40-50mg and what that looks like. For me, it sounds like perhaps vyvanse would be best for me and my needs but I am liking dexedrine. Definitely have to give vyvanse a try but curious about your experience."
Is 15 mg of Dexedrine per day a lot?,"Good, definitely try to get that appointment moved up! Keep close track of how much you’re taking. If the number in the bottle should have been enough for at least the number of days until your next appointment, figure out why there’s a discrepancy, including any possibility of anyone else having access to them. I find it’s extremely helpful to set out my pills for the week in a pill minder. Not only for keeping track, but also for noticing when I get down to my last week and it will be a crisis soon if I haven’t arranged for my next fill yet."
Is 15 mg of Dexedrine per day a lot?,"I take dextroamphetamine IR, not the ER spansules. I have a very slow metabolism and have never tried any extended release stim b/c I love sleep and don’t want to worry about getting some. 

But I take 5mg upon waking, 15mg about an out later. Then normal days I take 10mg around lunch time and 10mg around 1:30-2pm. That lasts long enough and I don’t ever crash. 

I have the option to play with those afternoon doses a little depending on need, like days I have an evening class, but I never take more than 45mg b/c it makes me feel bad. Did once by accident and was not happy about it."
psychiatrist said dexedrine is all i need to try and nothing else?,"B.S. Ritalin was the original ""math pill"" from the 50's(?). Check out the history.  Just remember once big daddy MD or FDA allow a drug, they can take it away also. So when you get old they may take it away because... Then you're dopamine receptors are non-functional and depression follows."

Dexedrine love/hate relationship,"Do you feel like this mainly affects your relationships with people at work or does it affect your personal life as well? 

In a work environment, disagreement is necessary. Of course you want to be on good terms with people, but you are working with people to achieve company goals. If everyone plods along with bad ideas, this can be extremely detrimental. Sometimes you need a person to assert new ideas or offer criticism of ideas. People might find it uncomfortable when you disagree with them, but it's important for people to get challenged on their ideas because it makes them consider whether or not it's the right course of action."
Dexedrine love/hate relationship,"I relate so hard to your post. I really enjoy taking it, but I find it stiffles me emotionally.. I feel lonely, but less likely to want to be social. I just kinda feel numb, but more energy and drive to work. I like the buzz so I am taking more than prescribed.. I also notice that if I don't take it I feel so tired, I feel like I need to take it to feel normal and energy to work. I know all these signs means I should probably take a break, or quit and just try to manage my issues some other way. I also have a pretty bad sugar addiction and I've been wanting to cut down or quit that too, but I get mad cravings for it. My will power is pretty bad haha.. oh well, will try to figure it out"

Dexedrine love/hate relationship,"I feel like it’s mostly at work where, as you say, conflict is necessary. Bizarrely for a few days now I’ve been taking caffeine alongside my Dex and it seems to have hugely reduced the anxiety symptoms and replaced them with a sense of competence and confidence. Bizarrely caffeine usually makes me jittery and paranoid, but when mixed with Dex I seem to get the benefits of caffeine without the usually unbearable side effects. Strange!"
Dexedrine love/hate relationship,"Best of luck man. I recently cut my dose down (after abstaining for a week or so) and I found that really helped to give me the positives without the drawbacks. I’ve also just had to get used to taking less in the afternoon so that it doesn’t mess up my sleep. This means feeling suboptimal in the eve, but that’s much better than having insomnia and getting more and more run down, with a consequence that the meds become less and less effective."
Dexedrine love/hate relationship,"One strange thing I’ve noticed is that caffeine has become more tolerable - enjoyable even - since taking Dex. I’ve only really noticed this over the last few days, but whereas it used to make me feel jittery, paranoid and ‘out of sorts’ it now seem to be quite lifting and, surprisingly, takes the edge off  a lot of the anxiety and seriousness I was getting from the dex."
Dexedrine love/hate relationship,"Totally relate. So hard isn’t it! It’s always so hard when there are parts you like and parts you hate about the meds. Probably in an ideal world I should use them sporadically - when I really need the lift and when I’m in less social circumstances, but as it stands I’m still using them daily and my sociability is in the toilet. Caffeine helps, bizarrely, but with Dex alone I’m horrific socially. I’m wondering about trying caffeine alone but that has historically been a sure road to anxiety and brain fog."
Dextroamphetamine/Dexedrine and feeling really out of it-normal?,"Dex is pretty full on and this is all similar to what I was experiencing. The worse part I found was the teeth grinding, by the end of the day I couldn’t eat dinner because my jaw was exhausted. 

I could be wrong as I’m mainly relaying information I have read here rather then hearing it from a doctor but I assume you were prescribed Dex due to your insurance/financial situation because from what I understand, Vyvanse and Dex are quite similar. Unfortunately, Vyvanse is quite expensive so Dex is the second option."
Dextroamphetamine/Dexedrine and feeling really out of it-normal?,"was Dex the first med you tried?

it really doesn't sound like this is a good match

fwiw I've been getting some similar issues with the crap generic Adderall that's flooded the market, but I figured that's probably from a higher than normal levoamphetamine content, present in Adderall but not in large amounts.

Dextroamphetamine Sulfate (Generic Dexedrine),"TEVA was like poison to me. Literally.  I don’t like any of the generics. I prefer Zenzedi. It’s a world of difference.  Also fyi, I don’t use extended release.  Doesn’t work for me."
Dextroamphetamine Sulfate (Generic Dexedrine),"I use a 15mg of extended release in the morning and short release at around 1pm before the extended wears off. Other ADHD meds wrecked me, but Dexedrine has been solid for well over 2 years now."
Dextroamphetamine Sulfate (Generic Dexedrine),I take Teva brand
Dextroamphetamine Sulfate (Generic Dexedrine),"I get the Aurolife generics, the ones that say U39 on them, and they work just fine for me. 

I want to try Zenzedi, but it seems like such a pain in the ass trying to get insurance to cover it and also find a pharmacy that carries it.

Various redditors have said they get it at Walgreens, Walmart, a grocery chain in Texas, and CVS.  It’s a pain in the ass but if it works for you it’s almost worth the pain.  Definitely call Arbor and ask.  And if you get through to anyone there tell them WTF.  You can try calling the supplier McKesson.  And leave a complaint with the FDA. Please.  This chaotic treatment of ADHD patients seeking good meds is inhumane. We are valuable and kind and deserving of respect."
Dextroamphetamine Sulfate (Generic Dexedrine),I feel you on that. I had to settle with Mallinckrodt tablets for now cause I was out of meds but I’m going to ask my pharmacy about ordering Zenzedi
Dextroamphetamine Sulfate (Generic Dexedrine),Mallink.. was my fav of the generics.
"If Adderall is causing anxiety, ask about Dexedrine!","I hate adderall with a passion. It makes me anxious and paranoid. I just never felt right on it. It also never really did much to alleviate my symptoms. If for whatever reason I took too much I'd inevitably hyper-fixate on porn. Of course it also has a bad affect on the blood pressure and kills the appetite. I was prescribed modafinil 8 years ago in college but I couldn't afford the $1600/month so I went back and got a script for Adderall XR, that was $300, still way outside my price range. So I ended up getting stuck with ir until I just had to quit. Recently I finally got another script for modafinil after learning that Costco discounts it to $40. It's like night and day for me. It's only been a short time and maybe the effects will change over time but so far the effects on my ability to concentrate are indescribable. I never knew that the right prescription could have this much of an impact."

"If Adderall is causing anxiety, ask about Dexedrine!","I had no idea rx modafinil was that much. That's insane. I wonder how Costco is able to charge only $40 but I'm happy for you! I've yet to try modafinil, however I have tried adrafinil (non-rx precursor/prodrug to modafinil), and I was surprised at how effective it was. I read reports saying adrafinil is worse for your liver and lasts longer than modafinil since your body has to slowly metabolize the adraf to modaf, which gave me insomnia.

Unfortunately I've only taken it on my off-days from amphetamines, so I'd imagine it would work even better without an existing stimulant tolerance. Thanks for the info. I'll inquire about modafinil at my next doc visit.

Edit: it's embarrassing how many hours I've spent looking at porn when over-stimmed. I feel you on that brother.

Also, Adderall COMPLETELY kills my appetite, whereas Vyvanse and Dexedrine have considerably less impact for me. I still eat plenty and maintain a healthy weight, but I blow up like a balloon if I stop for several months."
"If Adderall is causing anxiety, ask about Dexedrine!","It wouldn't surprise me if the first generics to roll out from Shire are still unreasonably priced. Vyvanse is superior in almost every way to its predecessors so I can see an incentive to keep the price high. Last time I checked, a month supply of vyvanse was $500+ out of pocket. It truly is disgusting."
"If Adderall is causing anxiety, ask about Dexedrine!",Some medications affect people differently. Honestly the crash is twice as bad from addetall/dex. Vyvanse is the smoothest imo
"If Adderall is causing anxiety, ask about Dexedrine!",Do you think it would be a good idea to mention to a doctor how adrafinil has good effects on my adhd symptoms and if it was possible to get a prescription for Modafinil for that reason being?
"If Adderall is causing anxiety, ask about Dexedrine!","I just switched from Vyvanse to Adderall XR and it was absolutely because of the price. With the $60 off that Vyvanse offered, I was still paying $264/month. And if I was ever proactive to fill my script the day that I ran out, then the coupon wouldn’t work. Had to wait until I was out completely to get the $60 off and I work early in the morning so I wouldn’t be able to go grab the prescription in time to take it before it was too late into the day.

Very frustrating because I absolutely agree—Vyvanse is superior. The Adderall XR isn’t the worst I suppose (it’s better than nothing? But.. hardly) but Vyvanse helped me so much more. I talked with my psychiatrist about the patent dropping in 2023 and we are also hoping that will create an affordable generic. Fingers crossed for us all."
"If Adderall is causing anxiety, ask about Dexedrine!",I doubt any psychiatrist would go for that. I think he'd probably suggest that you may not even have adhd if adrafinil works better than actual adhd meds. AFAIK modafinil is really only prescribed for narcolepsy. I'm not a doctor but that's my opinion

Dexedrine vs Adderall,"I know. But what I have currently is solely Dextroamphetamine. Not Adderall. Why would they change it up without discussing it with me?

Dexedrine vs Adderall,"You can call around and ask, but it might seem like you’re a druggie asking. I’m not sure where you’re from."
Dexedrine vs Adderall,"You can just call the pharmacist and straight up tell them that one brand works much better for you and ask them to make sure they order the brands that works for you. No need to worry about how someone “feels” about you so long as you’re doing everything legally and legitimately. They can judge all they want. At the end of the day, it’s your quality of life it’s impacting and they can suck it since there’s nothing they can do about it. If they won’t order an effective brand for you, go to a different place that will. Only relationship that matters is you and your doctors. Pharmacists can get off their glorified pill filling high horse."

Questions on Dexedrine after being prescribed Adderall for years.,Hi! I was on Vyvanse for a while and have been on Dexedrine for almost 5 years now. It is the only medication I’ve taken where I am still able to feel like myself on it. It doesn’t feel as “heavy” as the others if that makes sense.
Questions on Dexedrine after being prescribed Adderall for years.,I'm on Adderall XR 15mg for the past month(up from 10mg  that I took for 3 weeks) and it works great. I needed a booster dose for later in the day and asked my doc for Adderall IR but turns our IR isn't prescribed I'm Canada so they had to give me Dexedrine IR. I was worried about it since Adderall worked so well but Dexedrine works just as well for me and I've had no issues. Adderall is 75% D-amphetamine and 25% L-amphetamine while dexedrine is 100% D-amphetamine so it's pretty similar. Give it a try and see how it goes!
Questions on Dexedrine after being prescribed Adderall for years.,"I take Dexedrine and previously took Adderall. I find Dexedrine works better for me, especially for detailed tasks (I'm in accounting). I find it feels a little stronger at the same dose. Adderall is 75% Dexedrine anyway, so they are different, but it is subtle. I felt more mood swings when Adderall wore off. One possible downside is Dexedrine might last a little shorter. 6-10 hours VS 8-12 for Adderall. It works 10+ hours for me. Hope it works out for you."

Help me understand the science regarding length of effects when comparing vyvanse to dexedrine?,"Vyvanse lasts longer because your body doesn't break down the molecules all at the same time. Your body turns some of the Vyvanse into dexamphetamine and your brain starts using it. By the time that initial dexamphetamine has been used up, your body has metabolized more of the Vyvanse so there's now new dexamphetamine in your system, and this continues until the full dose is gone."

Help me understand the science regarding length of effects when comparing vyvanse to dexedrine?,"The drug release formulations are patented for drugs. Dexedrine is an immediate release medication, so its drug release profile is a sudden spike and fall pattern, whereas Vyvanse is a gradual release pattern that does not really plateau and then gradually falls off. How some drugs have longer release patterns is patented, which is why some generic brands of the same chemical do not work as well as the original."
Help me understand the science regarding length of effects when comparing vyvanse to dexedrine?,But apparently by the time you reach the 4th hour Mark based on some graphs I saw and a report I read that your body  will have broken down and absorbed all the lysine and once that happens it becomes regular dexamphetamine which then it makes no sense to me why it doesn't then last the same amount of time from that point as standard dex...
Help me understand the science regarding length of effects when comparing vyvanse to dexedrine?,Yeah I've been trying to research it and looking at the serum graphs etc. And my understanding is after 4 hours your body has absorbed all the lysine needed In total to release all the vyvanse and at that point it becomes regular dexamphetamine so that's why I don't understand why it doesn't then last the same amount of time as IR dexedrine from the 4 hour mark for example. I understand they're patented etc. But it's common knowledge how lysine is attached to the dexamphetamine and for your body to access it it has to first absorb the lysine so it's not like we don't know how it happens... It's puzzling.
Help me understand the science regarding length of effects when comparing vyvanse to dexedrine?,"From what I understand, dexamphetamine lasts 4-6 hours and Vyvanse lasts 10-12 hours for most people. That's not *that much* off of what you'd expect if you add the time to absorb lysine with the time to metabolize dexedrine."
How long does IR Dexamfetamine Sulphate last for you? Also is Dexedrine the same as Amfexa?,"I’ve been taking 70mg of Elvanse daily + 10mg of Dexamfetamine Sulfate (5mg + 5mg after 2h) 3/4 times at week for 6 months and I’ve not experienced any major side effects so far. 

However, my blood pressure has increased a bit (still under the pre-high stage but it used be on the lower side before meds), but it can also be related to me putting a lot of weight on recently, instead of being merely caused by the higher dosage. (I know I’m overweight and that I should drop few pounds for the sake of my heart, but despite being on a high dose of stimulants, losing weight has been impossible for me so far😭).

Being of this dose is the only way I can get 10h of coverage as I’m a fast metaboliser. I’ve started with 30mg, then 40, then 50mg, settled for 60mg for a year, and then added the dex in the afternoon. 5mg of dex lasts me 2h. 6 months ago the Elvanse started to wearing off after 2h, so we increased to 70mg and being good since then (70mg lasts ~ 6h for me). However, I don’t usually take them on Sundays and if I’m not busy, I only take 50mg on Saturdays. I also try to avoid taking the afternoon booster (dex) when I can, so my body gets a rest a bit. If your doctor thinks is safe, then I think you shouldn’t worry too much. Unfortunately, my understanding is that ADHD meds rarely last the time they are being advertised for."

How long does IR Dexamfetamine Sulphate last for you? Also is Dexedrine the same as Amfexa?,About 2 hours unfortunately :/
How long does IR Dexamfetamine Sulphate last for you? Also is Dexedrine the same as Amfexa?,"Do you take 70mg Elvanse & 5mg Dex together? As in the 5mg Dex will activate while the Elvanse is still active?

If so, does this make the effects of Elvanse feel like it lasts for longer?
**I titrated up to 70mg Elvanse & 20mg Dex to activate together, and the effects were stronger, but didn't overall last longer**

If you take them separately at those dosages, does the effect of 5mg Dex feel the same as 70mg Elvanse for you?

EDIT:  
I've also felt that my body should have a rest from the meds and so I've lowered my dosage frequency in the past also, but over time the negative effects have fortunately dwindled. At first it would bring my blood pressure from around 120/80 (give or take 5%) to about 145/100. After a few days it dropped a few points. With the medicine curbing my binge eating, and my new active job, my natural blood pressure is 110/70 and 70mg Elvanse brings it up to 117/80.

I also find that if I don't take any Elvanse or Dex for two days, it's better for me to start up again by skimming 10mg off the Elvanse capsule when starting back up. The side effects are milder and go away with continued usage.

At first with the meds I had appetite suppression and binge eating suppression. Over time the appetite suppression has pretty much finished, and the binge eating suppression is weaker. Somedays I'll still binge, most days I don't eat healthy but I can keep small portions. I've lost maybe 20lbs, and would like to lose another 10-15lbs, but I can't do that with what the medicine gives me. I'm happy with my body overall now though."
How long does IR Dexamfetamine Sulphate last for you? Also is Dexedrine the same as Amfexa?,"I take the Elvanse 70mg in the morning and then after 5h I take the 5mg of Dex, followed by another 5mg after 2h from the first Dex. I sometimes take the 5mg Dex and the Elvanse together when I know it’s gonna be a bad ADHD day (procrastinated bedtime the night before, the week before my period, being stressed more than usual, being tired due to being working overtime) and if I’m gonna be super busy that morning. However, this reduces the time of coverage to 7 hours, so it really depends on what my priorities are that day. Effects are stronger only if I take them together, but if I take 5mg after 5h + another 5mg after 2h, effects are the same as the 70mg took in the morning.

I had periods when I took them everyday because the benefits were greater than the side effects ( when studying I can’t really take days off as I work full time on top of my degree). However, at some point I ended up developing a crazy tolerance to them and nothing wasn’t working anymore. Usually, if I skip it for a day or two, I can go straight back to my prescribed dose without any side effects. I have a natural super high tolerance to meds and If I don’ take breaks, it gets to the point when it’s like taking a sugar pill. Plus, they will probably still have an impact on my body long term regardless their effectiveness, as every medication does. If you need to take it everyday though, I would suggest you not to worry too much about breaks. Just do what works for you and if it doesn’t, you can always ask your specialist to switch you to different meds. 

I’ve never struggled with eating while on meds, but I definitely used to binge a bit less initially!

How long have you been on the Elvanse? I’ve been on it since March 2021 and tolerance is a real bitch for me. I totally still don’t function as I wish and should! However, I’m also diagnosed with autism PDA and for that meds won’t help. I know my ADHD is kind of tackled though, because if I do start a task , I can focus on it until I finish it (which was impossible for me pre meds unless I was in hyperfocus mode). I’m also more emotionally regulated and my working memory seems to work a bit better, so I guess it is working overall 😂

I would suggest you to don’t over rely on meds effectiveness/duration though, as once the initial honeymoon phase is gone, they are only one of the many tools you can use to manage your symptoms. Meds+ ADHD coaching + accommodations + a good support network (all together) seems the only solution that works long term for most people. Apparently, once you have developed some degree of tolerance, meds are only supposed to help you focus more easily, but they won’t necessary be good for the other symptoms too. Also, a lot of things can impact your symptoms daily, so sometimes your dosage won’t be enough or last enough. Some days (or weeks) are harder than other and meds won’t makes you invincible 😊"

What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"I've been taking Concerta for almost half a year now. I only really felt the incredible bliss and calmness on my first three days of taking meds. I DID SO MUCH CLEANING BACK THEN. 

Did I build tolerance? I don't think so. I'm still on the same dose. I just don't feel the difference nearly as much since it became second nature to me. Now I don't have problems with consistently cleaning, I am in so much more control of my day and of myself. There are days when the meds don't work as well, and there are some of those days when I feel almost as incredible as I felt at first. Menstrual cycle impacts this too. And stress. The more stressed I am, the worse the meds work. Sleep matters too. Eating healthy (lots of protein!) is important. Exercise is always good. And sometimes meds just don't work just as well, and that's fine. 

With time you can find that meds are just a crutch, the thing that gives you a ""boost"". Try finding strategies that can help you with organization, emotional dysregulation and stuff. You already got some good recommendations in the comments. How to ADHD is amazing, very much recommend. 

But yeah. I found that before I started meds I couldn't stick to a new habit if my life depended on it, and now I'm actually capable of building new habits and somewhat sticking to them. Finally started using (a very messy, not at all Instagram-friendly) bullet journal, I'm addicted to Finch (a self-care app that can also work as a to-do list, it's very ADHD-friendly) and I meditate regularly, which helps with my emotional regulation (meds help with this a lot, too). Overall, I'd say all the strategies and habits help me tremendously, but I need my meds to be able to keep up with them. Both are equally important!"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"I see medication as like a gym membership. It gives you access to the tools you need to do the work, rather than doing the work for you. 
Just taking the meds doesn't improve your life, it just gives you the ability to do it yourself. You still have to do the work, and it's still hard, but the meds made it possible to do it. That's my take anyway."
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"I can actually get out of bed once the meds kick in.   
I can hold a job.   
I can be around people without constantly interrupting them and driving them away. 

So far resistance has not been a problem, I have been on my current doose for a few years. I thinkthat is a myth. Also, I take them every day, as I see no point to being useless on weekends, when I have time to live my life. 

I have NO DOWNSIDES to medication at all."
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"The “incredible” feeling when you first start is temporary as your body adjusts. It is extremely important to not chase that feeling as it is always temporary. No matter what you do. Once you find the correct dosage your body agrees with and is consistent, every day should feel pretty much the same if you keep a consistent diet, sleep, and medication cycle. Any changes will throw you off the track (in my experience). Didn’t get enough sleep, haven’t had a good diet lately, or decided to drink alcohol and it throws me off for a couple days to a week. When taking meds daily at the same time every day, having a good diet, and sleeping well while taking meds make me feel “alive and sharp” like I should be. The sudden transition in the mornings feels great and remind me why I am doing this. My life has certainly turned for the better since I started over a year or so ago. Meds won’t cure you but it helps tremendously once you start to improve yourself.

Also, I find that I get tired or exhausted quickly if I am not doing anything productive. Sometimes I will need to get up and walk around for several minutes and make sure I am hydrated and eating normally."
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"For me it felt like having access. Before it was like there were so many things I wanted to do, that I planned to do - but my body couldn’t follow what my mind wanted.

Being medicated gave me a choice.

Pre-medicated day in the life was usually:

- Mornings were loud, brain was immediately going a million miles a minute as soon as I opened my eyes, took forever to get out of bed if I had no obligation to 
- I always had to get up stupid early for work to finish all the work that I procrastinated on the day before
- lucky to get an average of 2 hrs of work completed in a day and so would sign up for focusmates, did pomodoros, literally tried every productivity hack known to man because I was so desperate to be more productive. Legit at one point had a timer that rang every 10 minutes so that I could be reminded to get back to work whenever I found myself distracted
- after work I was absolutely exhausted. I had no idea how people had energy to do more things after work. And if I did have stuff on my to do list like gym or cook dinner, I would be thinking about it and dreading it the whole entire day and would feel incapacitated of doing anything else until that was done. It didn’t even have to be something big it could be just watching a 5 minute video for school. 
- constant guilt and stark awareness/anxiety of time passing, I felt like I was always aware of the time like I can’t start X because then I’d run out of time in the day even though I had like the whole day still 
- constantly losing things. My god, I’d lose my glasses probably 4-5 times every day 
- not being able to put my thoughts into words. Explaining things at work always felt like I was speaking gibberish lol 

Post medicated:

I just live. Like straight up - I get up, go to work - work during work, get off at 5p then do the things I need to do around the house and chill. I still have lazy days but the lazy days are a choice - I’m tired so I will choose to nap, it wasn’t like I was laying in bed feeling guilty for hours because I really want to do X but can’t will myself to do it. And the intense awareness of time passing is gone, like I can still do things late at night because I’m not anxious about not having time to finish it 

With that though, the beginning was definitely more exciting because it’s like getting glasses for the first time and being amazed at all the things you can now see! But after having the glasses on for some time it just becomes second nature so it does feel less exciting. And for me sleep + menstrual cycle 100% affect it. If I get no sleep or it’s a week before my period it’s like I’m back to potato mode"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"Everybodies body is unique, so how one person might react to medication, will be different to another. Medication alone isn't enough to treat ADHD, you also need non medication strategies.

For information seek out How To ADHD, Russell Barkley, and Edward Hallowell. Maybe try joining an ADHD society at the university, I doubt you are the only person, also talk to the disability team, they might be able to give you resources.

Edit: Or create an ADHD society or support group."
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"A trick I discovered is even when you're on medication and working on tasks, narrate internally to yourself on what you're working on. It helps to guard against stray thoughts popping in and your mind latching onto it and running with it. For example, I'll tell myself im opening the door, im walking towards the bedroom, im cleaning desk now... etc. Stray thoughts will still pop in from time to time."
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"I haven’t built resistance yet, I’m 21 (f), started on meds when I was 19. 
at the start you might struggle with your appetite, but that will go back to normal after a few weeks.
for me I struggled a lot with deep depression the first two weeks but my psychiatrist told me to keep going and that went away too.
now they work perfectly for me (I’m on ritalin btw)
they help me remember things and not be distracted as often, it’s amazing during work or school! 
like I’ll take a shower and be suprised I remembered to bring a towel, it’s like discovering a different you! (not better, different)
i remember the first week I’d take them and then just sit still for a while enjoying the silence in my head, but after a while you get used to it <3

It's not as quick and immediate of a fix as stimulant meds (concerta, Ritalin etc) but after being on them for a while, it's like night and day for me. I share the same opinion as others, in that you still definitely have to put in the work and develop some coping mechanisms, but being medicated definitely makes day-to-day life easier. 

Strattera specifically has fewer side effects than stimulant meds. a few hours after you take it you may get a bit of a tummy ache, and I made the mistake of taking them on an empty stomach the first time, so I did vomit. this side effect becomes much less severe over time. 

When I was on stimulants I felt like a robot. this side effect is known and is able to be avoided with the right dosage, but I never got there with stimulants. they always made me feel down and slightly depressed. I never fully felt like myself. Strattera has never given me this issue. 

I tend to still have difficulties beginning a task and getting out of bed (as opposed to stimulants, which I feel make it much easier to start hard things), but I find myself far less distracted when doing undesirable tasks (mainly homework, as a uni student). When unmedicated I find I am easily overwhelmed by the emotional stress of my day-to-day life, whereas when medicated, I find myself able to organize my thoughts easier, and address the things that are stressing me out rationally without breaking down emotionally."
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"The first few days were incredible and I did a lot of work, but in hindsight not really extremely important stuff. I assume it was the medication together with the placebo (newness) effect giving an additional boost to do a lot of stuff. I washed clothes, cooked something, cleaned everything, but didn't really work on my master thesis which would have been much more important at the time.

After that it felt much more like a gentle nudge to stand up and do stuff and work on stuff more focused than before. I did sometimes asked myself if they even work, but the difference between taking them and not taking them is extrem, but over time taking them daily can make it feel normal.

I absolutely have better and worse days with the medication. Similar to other people having better and worse days, but even the worse days are not like the worse days without meds.

I don't really have any problems with resistances, but I do have sometimes problems getting new meds so I unintentionally have some downtime.

As advice I would recommend Russel Barkley's YouTube channel. Very informative. On the other hand I would recommend not actually associating everything with ADHD. Yes, there are a lot of problems you face with ADHD, but a lot of stuff is some other mental health issue or just a consequence from a symptom that gets misidentified as something else.
The reason being it doesn't actually help and is more of an emotional outlet. Understanding the core problems well is much more effective to solve problems."
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"I tried VyVanse and it FINALLY took all my noisy thoughts and condensed them into a unified voice. All in all, my focus majorly improved. I also have MS and it boosted my energy levels at 30 MG. However, generic brand vanished and I can't afford $430 for a 30 day supply. So I'll be talking with my doctor about medicines my insurance actually covers... any suggestions from the community of ADHD meds that are great focus boosts would be great cuz I'm lost with all the medications out there."
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"In the beginning it was amazing. I got diagnosed when I was around 23. I was taking it regularly but I wasn’t paying attention to my body as ADHDers do. 

I was staying up till really late. Sleeping in, forming bad routines, sometimes I’d eat and sometimes I wouldn’t since I just didn’t feel hungry when on the meds (I also lost a lot of weight at one point). 
Then years later I’d notice other odd things like I was a lot more tense on the meds. Clenching my jaw a lot more (I already clench my teeth while sleeping, but I just was not able to fully relax while on the meds), had to get a mouth guard to protect my teeth from further implications that eventually lead to surgery, and I even had panic attacks around that time. 

Looking back over it now, I think I was stressed out with uni/work and the meds just heightened each individual feeling I had and I may have been hyper-focusing on it. Also I was not scheduling out little breaks and it was just clockwork. 


So if I was to do it again here is what I’d do:

- try to create a simple schedule for the day (like what time I’d wake up, eat my meals and sleep)
- schedule in breaks for uni/work (especially work, I’d always feel guilty for taking breaks)
- high protein breakfast seriously does wonders for the rest of your day
- exercising goes a long way (go for a quick walk or bask in the sun/meditate when feeling stressed/bogged down) 
- keep track of what your body/mental health is going through when on the meds (get an app or notebook) so you can review how the meds are affecting you w the specialist 
- try to take a smaller dosage of meds or none when you don’t feel your best (its not as effective when you’re very tired, and I notice it would affect my mood)

These are just good guidelines to base your own off from. I don’t even do all of them regularly. But hopefully it’s sth you can think about."

What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"I've been taking methylphenidate for about 7 months now.

I have a base dose of concerta at 36mg.

Its just enough for me to do stuff at my job. Bit too weak in the morning but my job is not demanding so I'm ok with that.

If I have anything pressing to get done at work I just add a 10mg ritalin IR in the morning and maybe a 5mg in the afternoon if needed. Thats on a higher demand workload day or if I'm just plain struggling to stay on task.

Then after work I'll add 5mg IR every couple hours till my evening is over. Basically just extending the med in my own way. It works really well.

The meds have given me focus, energy, emotional regulation, verbal articulation, and improved cognition in some areas.

What it hasn't solved is general motivation, organisation and planning, impulsivity.

Also you need to direct your focus to something when your on it or you will focus on the wrong things.

as for resistance/tolerance I have been at 36mg concerta and 5mg ritalin IR x 4 times a day and only now I've made the decision to go to 10mg IR up to 4 times a day or two 10mg IR and two 5mg IR as the boosters.  


So thats roughly 56mg methylphenidate per day with the boosters and now I'll be up to 76mg methylphenidate per day with boosters.  


Also I'm trying to leave room incase I end up in a higher demand work environment and also giving myself time to build up the necessary behavioral skills in the areas the med isn't helping with.

Thankfully my pdoc lets me experiment and find what works for me."
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"i’ve been on the same dose for a little over a year (10mg ritalin) and aside from a two month stint where i couldn’t get my medication, i take it almost every day. i’ve never noticed the effectiveness going down aside from one or two dud bottles where i could tell the pills were not working. don’t worry about building a tolerance, if it’s something you need, then it’s something you should take!"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"The first couple days to a week on a new medication or dose will feel the “best”. It’s okay and it’s normal! 
I’m on my fourth ADHD medication in the 10 months since diagnosis. I upped my meds very quickly but my sister also did, my doctor said some people needs higher doses and some need less. It’s more of an overall picture. So she told me to not worry about building a tolerance because she’ll work with me and there are still a lot of options to mix and match

I take mine every day. I’ll set an alarm on the weekend to take it and go back to bed so I don’t wake up too late to not take it. But my sister doesn’t take it on the weekends. There isn’t a benefit to not take them or to take them on the weekends, it’s up to the specific person. Personally I like who I am with my meds and I feel better so I take them!"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"The one thing I'll add here is that if you experience a time when it seems like the meds ""aren't working"" anymore, it may not be tolerance, but a sign that what you're taking, or the dosage, needs to be changed up. I spent some time resigned to an idea that I just had built tolerance and that while I was improved, I was still struggling. I've since been working with my psychiatrist, trying different things and different amounts, and it's going *much* better.


Everyday, meds help me. I'm so grateful for having them. Even when I was on the wrong dosage, they were still helping."
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"the word i used to describe it is quiet. i still struggle with things, and i probably still need to put in more work to do ""simple"" things that someone without adhd wouldn't have to think twice about, but so much more of the noise in my life is gone which makes life so much easier. 

never had a problem with resistance really, some days i can take my meds and i'll feel like it doesn't do anything yes, but imo thats more when i've had things happen and my whole next day is just like bleh. for example, i was out last night till 4am and even though i took my meds today it was a struggle day - not cuz they didn't work but because my day was already thrown off. it woulda been a worse day without the meds though.

context - 19F and i take between 30-40mg methylphenidate (30mg ER, plus two 5mg rapid release ones if i need it that day. i'd say maybe 2 days a week i take both of them, most days i take one)"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"I’m on 36mg of Concerta and it feels like coffee without my heart racing, and a more calm, energetic feeling. I wake up feeling really tired, but once I take Concerta, I feel like I slept for a good 8-10 hours. 

The only negative I’ve experienced about being on medication is my blood pressure is really high (179/110) and I’m only 20 years old, which isn’t normal. Since Concerta is a stimulant, it has those risks. 

As for your concern on avoiding building resistance, I would just talk to your doctor about it. I don’t wanna give false medical advice."
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,40 mg of Ritalin (20 twice a day) and I’ve grown a tolerance to it. But when I don’t take it I am so tired and unmotivated to do anything at all. I struggle a lot still with executive function… I think I need a med change
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"its counterinutuitive to how the subconscious thinks about self interest but its your second day. the level of tolerance that you experience developing already (and trust me its common) isnt inherently a sign something is wrong.  its no different than starting a daily habit of caffeine intake and not feeling the same drive as your first however. . any psychiatric improvement or change, thats meant to last at least, should be studied or remembered over a long period of time, not 2 days"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"I'm gonna be real honest. 

First few days..... Ecstacy and got more done than I had in the prior year combined. 

Now:

If I eat with the meds:
-Sleepy right away and take hour nap
-Wake up and can do a normal amount of work for about three or four hours. Don't think about food and food can be repulsive. 
-Meds wear off abruptly and I'm exhausted. Grumpy. Hungry. 

If I take the meds empty stomach:
-Energy and productive within an hour. 
-Four hours of great focus and productivity. Jittery and talkative. Cannot eat. Never think about food. 
-Meds wear off INSTANTLY and I am so grumpy and pissed and mad at the world. Major crash. So exhausted I can't do anything. Binge eat."

What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,">I’m still in the process of getting my diagnosis but my doctor prescribed me 10mg of Dexedrine daily, working my way up to 20mg if needed

What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"I’ve been on methylphenidate for years. When I was 8 or 9 I started with extended release 10mg once daily that eventually worked its way up to 36mg once daily. It worked great for me and I always explained it as it’s not what I felt, it’s what I didn’t feel so what you said about not feeling it today is normal. If you’re feelin it feelin it then it’s probably making you a bit high which isn’t good if that’s how it makes yo feel every day but is normal to experience at first since it’s new in your body. Bust back to the story. Once I got to college I had, well let’s just say college was rough for me. I started selling my stuff as a broke kid who was just using the money to party. So after I left school, which is an easy way of saying I failed out, I still wasn’t using the medicine for a while and i started to find my true self as an adult for the first time on my own and off the medication and I honestly loved it… most of the time. I rediscovered that I’m the energy in the room and that I love to laugh and cry and just be me. BUT I couldn’t focus for shit so I tried to get back onto it at about 24 years old and it wouldn’t last a full day for me anymore even at 56mg once daily. But it did feel like all of the crossing ideas and unique thought trains I’d grown to love about my creativity were silenced. So I switched to a fast acting form at 20mg as needed (essentially Ritalin) which works great for me now!

If I know I have a big thing coming up I can take one 30 minutes before and I feel a little better then normal but not high for about 30 minutes then for the next 3 ish I feel normal but LASER FOCUSED. Then once things have worn off I’m normally done what I needed to be an actual adult for and then can be the unfocused and interesting and goofy me again.

But after my ramble what I will say is be on the look out for side effects. The common ones are loss of appetite and when I say loss I mean cya later good bye! I’ve dropped 70 pounds in 3 months by not changing my life style aside from restating my meds. Yeah it’s cool to lose weight but it isn’t healthy so watch out for that one. It’s also damn near impossible to fall asleep on any of these type of meds unless it’s wearing off or worn off completely for some. But I wouldn’t worry in my experience adhd is one the easier mental illnesses to get the right meds locked down quick! It’s not like others that change your brain chemistry! Talk to your doctor a about any changes good or bad if you say nothing and just deal with any changes(headaches, heart palpitations, depression, euphoria) they will thank they got the medicine and dosage correct!

Also it’s a good thing to let your close friends know, if you are comfortable telling them about your meds, so they can be on the look out for any changes you might not notice yourself. Things like over spending or taking more risks like driving faster because some meds can cause you to go manic and you won’t really notice the changes and think the extra spending is fine and the speedings is fun or whatever! 

FYI 99.9999999999% of the time any crazy weird side effects stop as soon as or shortly after you stop taking the meds!"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"Like the top comment said you have good days and bad days where the meds work extremely well and then days they don’t help at all.

I’ve talked about this here before that my Wellbutrin/Vyvanse is the perfect combo to stabilizing my mood and helping with my focus and adhd habits. I skip one or the other and it’s a recipe for disaster.

With that, some days my meds help me focus and I can love from one task to the other and then are days where I’m hyper focused but I’m not able to contain it and I’m dialed in but everywhere and all over the place lol. 

I suffer from frequent migraines (before taking Wellbutrin), some days I wake up grouchy, some days little things set me off early, but as soon as I take my meds..within 30 minutes I’m good to go. The honeymoon phase has been long gone but I’m assuming because of the Wellbutrin I can clearly pinpoint the switch being flicked on and I’m a good boy (38m)

I will also say, having a great support system helps even more than anything. My wife understands my triggers and when I’ve taken my meds and when I haven’t. My peers and my team at work know how to navigate my personality and how to coexist well. I can also say I’ve never been upset or sad T my ailments as they are just part of my personality quirks.

Rage is probably the one emotion that will truly kill any and all medication help. Once I’m seeing red I can calm down but I’m out of the game the rest of the day. No turning back. Stress does this as well but I’m not typically a stressed out person as I live in the day to day and will worry about tomorrow tomorrow, but I do get anxious and it’s hard to recover from that.

I still forget shit all the time. I still space out and disassociate. I still hyperfixate from one hobby to the next every 6 months. I’m still on my phone constantly. It really just depends on the day. Be kind to yourself. Just be you."

What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"I got my diagnosis for combined a month ago. Started Vyvanse 30mg a few weeks ago. 
It’s not a crazy big change, but definitely helps keep me a bit more focused. I’ve also noticed it helps keep my mind from wandering all over the place, more in the moment I suppose. So a day in my life has arguably improved. A little more alertness to tackle the day I suppose, I was very restless before, quite exhausted and inattentive for sure. 
An unexpected bonus, was my social anxiety chilled out a little. Just being more in the moment, instead of stuck in my head as much, really makes it easier to tackle small talk. 
It has seemingly raised my heart rate and blood pressure, but not to alarming levels. 
I’ve been helping around the house more and less irritable, because my minds not all over the place I suspect."
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"I took dextroamphetamine all throughout high school and loved it, really enabled me to be able to study and felt so much less anxiety, life was really always fine. Other kinds of medications (concerta, amphetamine) did not work well for me and too high dosages made me feel like a robot tho so do be careful about that! Sadly a company patented or bought dextroamphetamine in my country and only their brand version is available now. Its pretty expensive and I have a lot more side effects (cant eat with it, cant sleep if i take it anywhere after 11 am even tho i take the 4 hour ones and the package just says do not take after 4 pm) and if i take it multiple days in a row I start to feel jittery and stressed and irritated. I tried everything like lowering dosages but it doesn’t make it better. I am in college now and can afford to take them only for a few days around exams, the only somewhat good thing about this is that the blissful feeling happens every time i start taking it again. I hope you wont have any of the same reactions but do pay attention to your weight and your sleep schedule, they can be impacted a lot, and don’t be afraid to switch medications a few times (and try them for some time) it took me a while to find the one that worked too even tho all of them worked well in the first week of taking them."
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"Is a tonne like a metric ton or an imperial one? Great, now I'm going to hyperfocus on that and look it up and probably ruminate on it all day. 

That being said, I can speak to the tolerance thing. I have been taking 20 mg XR and 15 mg IR of Adderal for close to two weeks. Just got my Dx also. Sunday, I took the 20 mg XR, but did not feel I needed the extra 15 mg during the day. I did feel it wearing off in the mid to late afternoon, but at that point, I wasn't going to take more, b/c I need sleep. The next morning, yesterday, I took my regular XR dose and took the IR at about 8a. When it kicked in, I did feel the difference from not taking it the day before. It worked ""better"" is the only way I can describe it. I would advise speaking with your provider about cutting back or skipping a dose on days when you don't have to be your sharpest, like weekends when you can veg out and rest for a day."

What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"im 19f, also a uni student who recently started with Concerta. i had a pretty similar experience; the first time i took it i felt so focussed and i got so much more done than i usually would. but subsequent times it didn't seem to have the same effect. i just chalked it up to placebo (which is obviously a powerful tool) and me having a hopeful attitude towards this 'magic' pill. 

for me, i feel like doses that last for a shorter period of time work a lot better, so i usually take a 3 hour dose twice a day, rather than one 6 or 9 hour dose in the morning."
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"I've been taking the generic of Adderall XR for about couple years now (as an adult). I was medicated when I was younger (approximately 8-10 years old) but stopped because the meds made me feel like a zombie. 

I restarted my meds during COVID, as my ADHD symptoms became unmanageable working from home (think remote in the fridge, half-finished projects, forgetting to pay bills, etc). I was also constantly irritable and it was taking a toll on my relationship with my wife. When I restarted my meds, it was a life changer. I worked my way up from 10mg to 30mg and it's helped my focus x10 and my mood completely stabilized. Initially, I lost a little weight because it hindered my appetite but after a few months it went away. Also had a hard time sleeping at night when I bumped up my dosage, but that also went away.

It isn't a cure-all by any stretch of the imagination. I still have good days and bad days, but I've found that a combination of meditation and consistent exercise also help manage ADHD. I workout at least 5 days a week and it helps me with mood stability and focus. Talking to a psychiatrist about my ADHD also unveiled that I have BPD, which commonly co-occur. Can't stress enough how important it is to have an open, honest line of communication with your mental health professional."

What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"I’ve been experimenting with being medicated and I have been trying to find something that helps me with focus. I went it in for a wellness exam at my doctor and she asked about my mood and I said that I thought I had a lot of symptoms of ADHD. I had a lot of mood swings, I was anxious and depressed, I talked too much, I couldn’t focus and I was related a little too well with all of the TikToks I had been seeing. For almost the last year I’ve experimented with Atomoxetine and Lamotrogene. I have tried Wellbutrin(didn’t like that one it made my hands shake and made me super anxious) I feel like I’ve finally found a doctor who is listening to me, and now my insurance is giving me so much red tape to just get on a low dose of adderall. I was supposed to try vyvanse- red tape again. It’s definitely harder to get on stimulants but I’m willing to try. I have a really hard time cleaning and exercising and I think I binge eat sometimes.

What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"Hmm I guess I have had a not necessarily positive experience, but I might also be dealing with a bunch of other mental health issues I haven't been diagnosed with. 

I'm taking 30mg Vyvanse (I suspect I need a higher dosage, but I had been having anxiety issues for the past few months as well as some cases where I have elevated heart rate and blood pressure readings at my primary care physician's office), and even though it does noticeably wake me up in the morning, I notice that most problems either still exist or my problems with hyperfixations (just get sucked into a single thing for hours and hours sometimes 18+) seem to be either worse or more difficult to manage.

However, I am confident that I am still a tiny bit more productive than without it, which is why despite the tepid to negligible improvements I have decided to remain on them (I had considered coming off, and my family has been quick to blame my medication for a lot of my recent problems despite the fact I had been improving on the medication until relatively recently). 

I am also unsure if it has been giving me mood swings, if that's the Wellbutrin, or if I'm just a dick.

Most of what my expectations for medication have been disappointing only by comparison to how much it seems to have helped others. I keep reading how for others it's almost like instant clarity, and they feel noticeably different.

No such experience for me. I've tried Adderall (got flagged in the system for resting heartrate of 115 BPM and BP of 140/100 during a checkup, and I wasn't allowed to be on my Antidepressants while taking it especially since I have had seizures at all, though just one very serious episode as a baby), and Guanfacine (incredibly sleepy all day). Vyvanse hasn't had either of those drawbacks, but on any of those medications, it hasn't *felt* appreciably different.

I think for me, what has been more helpful are behavioral therapy adjustments that have very incrementally improved over many months. I used to stay awake until sunrise at least once a week, sometimes more. Now it only happens a few times a month, and it's likely getting better. 

I have a lot of problems with self-regulation and impulse control, so I would always stay up too late, and wake up late for work or sometimes not at all. I failed classes in university, I somehow finished a few years later, but still had to be let go from my first job (it was also my dream job) because of my mental health issues inhibited my ability to even go to work, and while there, the mental fog caused me to make egregious mistakes and I had to be pulled off of projects. 

The next few years I managed to work a job I was often displeased with and underpaid, and I often needed my parents to wake me up in order to work.

A lot of that I didn't realize was exacerbated by ADHD, and once I started getting treated specifically for it, I have had virtually zero problems with attendance (outside of a few months that seemed like some kind of burnout), and have been more independent.

Things are far from perfect: I have trouble remembering or initiating eating once a day. Vyvanse and other amphetamine-based medications really kill your appetite, but at least I lost the weight I had gained while on Zoloft like 6-7 years ago.

This became rambling and over-sharing, but if you happen to read this, hopefully it might help in case you don't have a ""magic pill"" experience.

Sometimes it's difficult to see the small positive changes you've made over time, and you have to forgive yourself for the mistakes you've made before you were properly medicated. I think if I had been medicated at your age, maybe my life would have taken a totally different direction. Oh well."
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"Currently on Concerta 54 and it's been great. Some days are a little different, but they are the days I miss lunch. Eating regularly seems to have a big impact. Skip a meal and it seems like I haven't had any meds."
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"I am new taking 10mg adderall, and this is my second day so kind of similar to you...and the effect felt wayyyyy less today than yesterday. although I did get a test and paper done, but that was last minute due date panic stuff (which I always do). So I have no idea what to expect going forward."
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"My experience with meds(was in them from age 6-18 then back on now at 26) is that during the time I didn’t take them, almost all of my tics stopped. Although it took some practice for the social cues, it was easier to talk to people and have conversations. I did occasionally drift off, but while on medication I am constantly quiet and it can feel extremely hard sometimes to speak up. Like my heart gets racing like crazy just building up the confidence to answer a question. My binge eating stopped though after I got back on, and been the cleanest ever and started taking care of my skin and groomed more. 

To me, there’s pros and cons on both sides. And grass is always greener, I always end up getting sad and miss some of the traits I’d lose in between. I’m in a period though where I’m working full time, taking classes, wanting to take care of myself after years of neglect, and needing to organize my emotions. So medication has been making all of that possible."
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"get up


take my meds 


shower and get dressed 


go to the office 


Try to work without eff'ing up, fail,  get threatened by the boss 


Go home


Go to bed and do it again the next day till I drop dead."
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"Before getting medicated I used to get to my computer at 9 am and start working around 3 pm lol 

I struggled to find motivation to do even the most basic tasks in the past. However, I have recently regained my motivation and have realized how much I enjoy the work I do

It's currently 7 am here, and I'm going to study a little bit lol"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"Answering this pretty late so you’d probably not see it but here goes

I’m just a few weeks into treatment (Concerta) and since day 1 I didn’t feel “high” from the drug as much as I felt a bigger urge to be productive instead of scrolling endlessly. If I were to sit still on a chair I couldn’t even tell I took anything, which raises a bigger aspect: standing still lol. More or less with any dead time I had I’d fidget on my chair to no end. I can now focus on college work and get things done for once, same with my job.

When it comes to tolerance, if the medication is used as intended and not abused then tolerance build extremely slowly. You have to keep in mind that many stimulant abusers take doses far higher than anything that’s truly needed to manage ADHD, which is the reason their tolerance skyrockets. But if using the medication mindfully then I can’t see any tolerance issues arrive. And even then, my doc told me that a small break usually resets it.

Just last weekend I did a test and went without using the treatment both days to see what would happen. Apart from the usual ADHD symptoms returning to what they were pre-treatment I found no negatives. If anything, my anxiety was reduced so I guess this is progress.

Obviously people have different days even when medicated, but at least in my case I saw a huge difference in how often my mood would change from minute to minute even sometimes. Before Concerta I’d often feel like I was capable of moving mountains only to have all that motivation turn one minute later into wasting 3 hours researching snail habits on leaf preferences. But while on treatment these mood fluctuations went out the window and it’s been amazing, and even if I still get the occasional impending doom feeling I can get over it very quickly."
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"Just totally locked in to whatever you’re doing. Two things to worry about. First locking into the wrong things. If you have shit to get done, locking into Reddit, Facebook, video games, reading, etc can really derail your day. Secondly, being so locked in on your routine that other things fall to the wayside. Make sure you are able to breakout of your routine to take care of tasks that outside of your routine. I have an orthodontist appointment that I need to schedule. For two weeks I have been waking up saying I need to get that taken care of but I’m too locked into break off and get it done."
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,The rush of productivity I got when i started meds has definitely died down but I’ve been comfortable at 27mg of methylphenidate for almost 4 years. I went up to 36mg at one point but it gave me too many side effects so I had to sacrifice a bit of executive function but i haven’t become resistant to the medication. Some people just need higher doses. If you find you need to keep upping your dosage then your psychiatrist might suggest switching to a different one.
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"Dexedrine is the best, (though my tolerance is way high now) I’m able to clean, organize and get my things done without overthinking it. It helps with my binge eating and my impulsiveness.. which is huge."
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"So with most stimulant meds that are out of your body within a day, you can build up tolerance. So I’m told to take 1-2 days per month off meds to help prevent tolerance. 

There are always going to be good days and bad days with ADHD. The only way to accurately describe us is as “consistently inconsistent.”

This sort of issue never goes away but you can get better at dealing with it and anticipating when it will happen. ADHD issues can be improved by establishing routines, learning your mind and your habits over time, finding what times of the day are best for you to do certain tasks, getting professional help for things like behavioral therapy, delegating things or getting help on things you absolutely suck at, and just try to get advice and experiment with what works best for you. 

Most importantly, forgive yourself when you screw up. Because it’s going to happen and you’re going to get mad, and you’re going to try really hard and it’s going to happen again, but in all likelihood, it’s not your fault. 


Examples for me:
-I put everything I’ll need or worry I’ll forget the next day in my backpack and then put my backpack by the door where I have to move it to get out. Then I’m like why is this door not opening? Ooh my backpack!

-I really struggle with writing in the morning so anything requiring lots of writing I do in the afternoon so my researching or emails or calls etc are mostly a morning task

-put all your bills on autopay and check them when you remember so you aren’t getting over-charged

-if I have to plan anything major I get everyone I can involved, both to get their insights but also to delegate things to make it easier on me because I can’t organize worth a damn 

-I worked with a behavioral therapist (as an adult) and they really helped me pinpoint some of my issues and find ADHD friendly ways to get around them (like schedules or to do lists or paperwork)"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"I recently got diagnosed and started with concerta XL, I get the calmness some of users have said, all the mental ruminating and noise disappeared! It's amazing. 
One thing I found super helpful was adding in a short acting drug in the mid afternoon so I don't crash in the evening!"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"Some days it's subtle, the brain is quieter and things are easier to focus on and some days it gets me high as fuck, so much energy and zoom zoom zoom."
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"The medication balances a neurochemical issue. There are still a million other variables for motivation and energy. Diet, hydration, sleep, exhaustion, straight not feeling like it, wrong time of day, too much coffee, not enough coffee, too much sugar, not enough sugar, burnout, your roommate made you mad...
Being in university you especially have to account for mental burnout. Your brain just gets tired. Adhd meds don't address that. Adequate rest does.

Medication Is half the battle with adhd. You still have a lot of management to do otherwise. As anyone else without adhd also would on a normal basis. 

Me personally, Once the medication is in, I still have to engineer my day right, and the first hour of my day sets the tone. I gotta get up and go and do chores immediately, or I'm gonna be on my phone an entire day. And I gotta eat properly and be hydrated or I'm gonna be brain foggy tired and cognitively weak, and if I don't keep on top of things for days I'll slip into bad habits and no amount of medication can fix or prevent that.

It's hard to tell if you're building resistance or not, but, you can't assume a bad streak means the medication isn't working. It covers just one base.

Side note: l sneak it into every post I can..  I was in my 30s before I learned how important diet *actually* is. Please learn this way earlier than I did. You have to eat properly. Your brain depends on it. It doesn't even have to be hard. Frozen fruits and vegetables are actually healthier than fresh for example. A lot of people don't know that extremely adhd friendly tidbit."
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"I hate medication, they forced me on that stuff when I was in 2nd grade (up until 9th)

made me feel like a zombie stripped me of my passion and creativity…

just didn’t work for me (result standpoint; I was overweight, bad with people, poor grades) 

All of these things would drastically improve once I got off of the meds 

I wouldn’t start getting my life together until after I renounce the pills

Granted, even in my best times I shoot for semifunctionality

I’m just a high maintenance person and that’s that


But everybody’s story is different"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"I can’t thank you enough for this advice! I’ve been told multiple times how meds and habits need to be balanced to succeed with ADHD, but I didn’t know if i was on the right track. I really appreciate your insight on how I should focus on sleep, diet, exercise, and overall health for the meds to work optimally. This helped me stop overthinking, so thank you SO much for this FR."
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,I find habits are still very hard to maintain. So I find cycling through different ways of building the habits gives me enough novelty to keep going with it otherwise the monotony results in me abandoning the habits lol
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,I’m starting Concerta as my first med. I just got bumped up to 36mg going into my 3rd month. I get more done. I also sleep a lot longer than I did before. But yea it doesn’t make up for poor habits. I stayed up late last night instead of going to bed and my dog woke me up early needing to go out. Now I’m scatter brained.
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"I just started some meds 2 weeks ago, and today was just horrible. Like a bad day without them. Your comment about stress was a lightbulb moment, as today was crazy stressful, and that makes a ton of sense.

Thank you!!"

What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"if you don't mind me asking, what dose are you on? just started concerta xr 18mg and i'm not sure if it's enough for me"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"I have the exact same experience. Taking meds enables me to put in good practices and structure and stick with it. It's not perfect every day, but that's ok. It was weird, because from day 1 I didn't really feel different, but everything just went different, if that makes any sense. I had a lot of problems with executive functioning, and from day 1,  I could suddenly get up on time, do the tasks I had set for myself for the day, drink enough water, eat healthier (lots of protein), got rid of my coffee/diet coke addiction, lost some weight and I get work done without endless procrastination etc. In general, I feel calmer and more balanced. 

I feel sleep has become way more important, I need at least 7 hrs or my meds seem to not work as well. My period affects the effectiveness of the meds somewhat, but not as much as I had feared from reading comments. Exercize makes it feel like the meds last longer. I'm experimenting with not taking them on the weekend, because a lot of people mention that taking a break now and then makes the meds more effective on other days, but I'm not too sure...I think I do best when I just keep taking it. 

My favorite book so far is The Year I Met My Brain, by Mathilda Boseley. Especially if you are diagnosed later in life (which I was, in my 40s), I highly recommend reading it."
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,You’re absolutely right. It tremendously helps my focus but at the end of the day I’m the one in charge of directing my focus to whatever is most productive and beneficial to me. Thank you for your insight!
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,I love this outlook!!!
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,this is very helpful thank you!
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"I second all of that too. I have a memory, I can hold conversations (and not blank after 3 words), I can shit everyday, I am emotionally perfect and can be helpful and do dishes or be patient, I can do math, etc. I'm a normal person. Never imagined anything like this. No downsides"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"THANK you! This is what I needed to hear honestly. I felt so amazing on day 1 but I know deep down inside that chasing that same feeling is unsustainable and definitely not healthy. Someone’s comment above mentioned that the incredible feeling is likely due to introducing meds for the first time + some placebo effect + novelty and excitement. I appreciate you sharing your experience, this helps a lot! <3"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"I'm glad to see people mentioning the menstrual cycle. For nine or ten days before my period I'm useless, nothing seems to work. It's frustrating because that's like a third of a month where everything is in slow motion, but hey, at least the other two thirds seem to be doing a lot better!

I shall now use ""in potato mode"" to sign off emails in those troubled premenstrual times. Thank you."

What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"THANK YOU! Your comment makes me feel so much more normal. And you’re so right about discovering a different you. I feel like ive been underachieving my whole life when I know I can do so much better, and seeing the change in my ability after meds has been crazy. It feels like I’ve unlocked my entire brain. Thank you for your kind words, it means the world  <333"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"Thank you for your insight! I definitely agree with what you observed on the first couple days, that combination of introducing medication + placebo effect + novelty and excitement definitely made a fire combo, and i did the exact same thing as you - TONNES of cleaning and cooking instead of studying for finals. Thank you for your recommendations and advice about not associating every struggle with ADHD, I’ll definitely check those out.  :))"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"This is very helpful advice, thank you.

What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"Thank you for this, you’re so right about needing to direct focus. I keep forgetting that if i’m the one responsible for directing my focus. I appreciate your insight!"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"Thank you! It’s very relieving to hear that. I’m hoping as long as I can keep my sleep, diet, and physical activity in check, the meds should help me out and do their job. :)"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"Thank you for sharing that! I’m so sorry to hear about the blood pressure issues it’s causing, that’s definitely not good for your circulatory system in the long run. I ended up having the opposite experience with meds (so far). I’m usually very anxious all the time, but the meds seem to have cleared my head and calmed me down. I’m hoping it stays that way."
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"I’m so sorry to hear that. I hope things get better for you and you find meds that work for you! 
If you don’t mind me asking, what was the progression to 40mg like? Do you feel like the lower doses stopped working and needed to increase the dosage? Or was it 40mg from the start? Sorry, I’m still very new to this. :)"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"You’re right! Plus it’s ramadan and i’m fasting, so the lack of energy throughout the day definitely played a huge part. I’ll continue to monitor how the meds make me feel now that ramadan is ending and I can maintain a better sleep schedule and diet. Thank you!"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"Thank you for sharing! I appreciate the brutal honesty. I’ve noticed feeling a little sleepy after taking meds too, do you think there’s a sweet spot for that food+meds combination? or do we just have to thug it out."

What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"I’m ngl this was one emotional rollercoaster, but I’m so happy for you and glad you found meds that suit you! 56mg sounds like a mountain load of stimulation! 
I haven’t noticed any of the typical side effects so far but i’ll definitely keep an eye out. On the contrary actually, I found that the dexedrine made me feel less anxious (probably because I’m no longer bombarded by stressful thoughts). I appreciate you taking the time to share this :)"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"This was really reassuring, thank you. I feel like i’ve been pushing myself more than I should because logically if ADHD was what was holding me back, then on medication I should be on track to reach all my goals. Clearly it’s going to take time and unlearning old habits to learn new ones. I’m glad i got to read your perspective and experience."
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"I resonate with this! Even though it’s only day 3 of trying out medication, i’ve noticed that i’m a lot less anxious; probably because i’m no longer bombarded by stressful thoughts about university or work constantly. I’m sorry to hear about the blood pressure issue, it seems to be a common occurrence among the replies of people taking higher doses in this thread. I really hope you’re able to find a way to manage it and protect your cardiovascular system in the long run. thank you for sharing!"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"Thank you for sharing that, i’m so sorry about the patent and medication switching up for you. That sounds awful to be honest and I really hope you’re able to find the right medication for you. I’ve been prescribed dextroamphetamine as my first starter medication too and was given dexedrine from the pharmacist (I assume they’re the same thing), and it’s been amazing so far; lowers my anxiety and clears my head, but takes an hour to kick in. I’ll definitely continue monitoring how they make me feel, thank you!"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"That’s very interesting, I’m going to speak to my doctor and consider taking gap days when I don’t really need it, especially over the summer. Thank you for sharing!"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"Hey! You’re definitely not alone :) 
It’s honestly 10x harder learning to navigate ADHD at this age when we have seemingly unending responsibilities at university, but I’ve found that the support groups at university really help. My university has support advisors and support circles, and it’s an amazing way to meet more ADHD-ers and learn their strategies from them. Definitely check if your university offers these!"

What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,I’m really sorry to hear about your experience with meds. I didn’t know kids as young as 2 could even get put on medication. I hope you’re able to find the right coping mechanisms and strategies to manage your adhd. :)
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"No problem, always happy to help! Just don't stress it too much and take it one day at a time. You're already doing amazing by having so much curiosity and wanting to understand yourself better. <3"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"Oh yeah, definitely! In my case I see improvement in maintaining habits, but I think part of it is also because I finally gave up on being ""perfect"". If I skip a day or two I don't beat myself up, so it's a little easier to get back into it if I don't associate the habit with shame. And just not being super rigid. I don't really have specific times when I do things, specific ways I have to stick to daily. I found that being overly rigid would stress me out and if I can cheat my brain into believing I have more freedom, monotony tends to bother me less.

Cycling habits is a great idea! I may get bored of a habit, but find it exciting again after some time. In general I think that minimizing shame and just letting yourself go with your brain rather than against it can be helpful."
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"Stress sucks! In my case, when I'm extra stressed and anxious (and sleep deprived...) my meds can actually make ADHD symptoms WORSE instead of better, so sometimes I just skip a day if I know I'm doing terrible or I take a smaller dose. 

No prob, good luck on your journey!!"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"One of my worst symptoms is not being able to ignore dirt or clutter, and not being flexible when those things happen, but also getting overwhelmed with organizing or cleaning."
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"Totally get it! I always hated cleaning, but sometimes had those moments when I would procrastinate and instead go deep cleaning the closet, lol. Now I'm just way more neutral towards it, without hating it so much, but also not using it as a distraction."
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"36mg! I do have one pack of 18mg that I was supposed to use on top of my base dose if I ever needed it, but I didn't find it necessary. 18mg is a very small dose, since it's supposed to be releasing into your body over the period of around 10 hours. Obviously, it might be enough for some people, but anecdotally most adults need more than that. I also use 5-10mg IR boosters sometimes.

When I first started out I was put on 10mg IR a day (for a trial for like 2 weeks) and I felt the results but they weren't enough, so my doc bumped me up to 36mg XR soon after. So there's a chance you need a bigger dose or that possibly Concerta isn't the med for you!"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"I’ll repeat it again just because it can’t hurt and it’s really really fucking important. 

Do NOT chase that feeling. Please. You will never get it again unless you actively either stop meds for a week+ OR intentionally abuse if. Do NOT do it. What you felt was euphoria and it’s not something your brain is capable of feeling consistently. 

You’re doing great. Take it as prescribed, don’t skip days, don’t take extra doses, and get PLENTY of electrolytes and water throughout the day. 

No caffeine or vitamin C and hour prior or following your dose as these will essentially nullify the medication. 

Eat a good helping of lean protein 15 minutes after your dose. If you don’t like chewing meat/eggs, get whey protein powder and down a shake in place of eating your protein. 

Every negative side effect I’ve ever had from stimulant medication has been tied to: 

I need water/electrolytes or I need protein asap. Chugging a glass of water and demolishing a little beef jerky/protein shake gets me back in the game every time I get a headache towards the end of the dose’s effective period."
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"I was put on 40mg to start. Originally I was prescribed it for binge eating disorder but it wasn’t helping that, I think that’s why he wants me to take it twice a day because I’d take it before I eat. My insurance won’t pay for vyvanse which is what would actually help with BED though"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"I think it's really important to eat with the meds. Most will say the same. Especially protein. 

Also try to force yourself to eat a meal about four hours in. 

Some other things I've read that help the crash:

-Drinking coffee or something caffeinated toward the end of the med effectiveness/before the crash.

-it depends on the meds and check with your doctor .. but for Vyvanse.  Some people open the capsules and mix the powder into a drink and drink it throughout the day Instead of taking it all at once. 


-once you figure out how it works for you, try to schedule your day/tasks around the meds. 



-taking it consistently every day does help with the crash.


Also..... A lot of people say the sleepiness is bc the ends help your mind slow down. A non ADHD person would react differently to stimulants, but for people with ADHD, it can actually calm you down and relax you, or so I've read anecdotally on this sub."
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"So far what I’ve found that works best (I’m still new to meds as of a month ago so ymmv) is I set an alarm for about 60min  before I need to wake up and take my meds. Go back to sleep if I can (usually no problem unless I gotta pee)
Then wake up 30min before my kids need to be up and down a protein shake with oatmilk and then I’m actually able to be like, dressed, with bacon frying on the stove when it’s time to wake them up. 
Mornings have been so much  better since I’ve done this trick.

I’ll prepack a bowl with banana, greek yogurt and protein granola so I can munch on while I’m waiting to drop my youngest off (there’s 45min between HS and elementary schools here)-if I don’t bring the brekky I start to get REALLY nauseous.

It’s made a world of difference.

Before I’d wait-I’d take it once I’m up with a shake and then it was hit or miss. I never felt hungry 
(I’m ravenous when probably medicated lol) and I didn’t really feel any different."
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,">Yesterday was my first day, I felt incredible and got a tonne of things crossed off my to-do list. I was looking forward to having the same success today but it’s nothing like yesterday.

If it helps you out then that's good.

Just be safe, usually the start of medication involves a process called 'titration' where the patient and the treating professional work together to find a dose while discussing any side-effects and taking measurements of vitals (blood, heart rate, etc). This process can take time.

Good luck, look after your health and don't rush it. Personally I'd be mindful of doing much without someone actively working with me."
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"Yeah, expecting anyone with ADHD to read that, even mediated haha"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,Thanks! Good luck on your journey!
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,I've been told it lessens the tolerance and dependency (addiction).
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"Because now I have to pay attention to make sure I notice side effects. Usually if you notice a mild side effect (depression, soreness, dry mouth, could be literally anything) that side effect is gonna get worse and worse until you can’t stand it anymore. If it’s a physical one, you’ll probably realize it and just stop taking the meds but if it’s a psychological one you might not realize something is wrong until it’s very wrong.

I also have to coordinate actually getting the meds, which are always in shortage these days. Calling pharmacy’s, talking to the doctor, etc. if you can’t get exactly what you’re looking for, you might be able to get something similar (like a slightly different dose, or a chewable version of the medication) but the pharmacy is limited in what information they can give you so sometimes it’s difficult. And I’m dependent on these meds now so if I can’t get them I turn into a useless guy who sleeps all day.

There’s also just the matter of remembering to take it and making sure you don’t take it twice. If you forget, you’ll have a bad day because you’ll be useless that day. If you accidentally do it twice you might have a panic attack or something, depending on what medication it is. You’ll want to get a pill organizer or one of those bottles with a timer on the cap (that’s what I use) because these mistakes are very easy to make for people with ADHD.


It sounds like a lot of bad, but I work a job where the amount of money I make is directly tied to how productive I am, and since getting medication I’m making twice as much money and my life is way better."
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"Thanks, but that's okay. Sometimes it's hard for me to be terse, and it does take me more effort to condense it than I'd prefer to admit, and I didn't make as much of an effort this time.

The best I can do is try to break up my thoughts into smaller paragraphs, which also adds length 😕

Unfortunately, that's kind of how I am, though I know it's not ideal for most people here (I also have the same problem with reading walls of text, so it's hypocritical in a way)

I also tend to delete more than I write, so I am trying, but not always successfully. Appreciate the feedback, though."
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"Thank you for your kindness, I am very good at living an alternative lifestyle mostly because my mother was also ADHD so I learned by watching she was a master of self-care"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,Yes for sure. My pdoc told me to give myself some slack. So I too have worked on allowing things not needing to be perfect. It's a learned skill 😄 Cheers
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,That's super valuable information too - I'll keep an eye out for that!
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"I just started stimulant meds (literally today) and appreciate this advice so much. Someone said something similar to me yesterday so I've heard it multiple places now. Not getting a euphoric ""pop"" doesn't mean the meds aren't working. Thanks again"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"This is fantastic advice! The changing the euphoria! You’re absolutely correct that the brain can not sustain constant euphoria-
Just ask any heroin or opiate addict. 
I personally have to be very careful of this.

I’m just happy to see the advice written plainly here. Especially folks who have never used mind altering substances may not understand *how* or *why* addiction can happen."
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"Yeah I’ve definitely felt LESS anxious after taking the meds, which sounds super counter-intuitive. Personally I’ve found that my mind is no longer bombarded with stressful thoughts and im able to stay level headed and focus on living in the moment. 

I’ll definitely try a little bit of caffeine to help with the crash. Have you found working out or physical activity to help prevent the crash at all?"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"You’re right, im definitely not planning on taking 20mg without trying 10mg for a couple weeks and discussing it with the doctor. Thank you!"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,thank you! I hope you ended up figuring out the ‘tonne’ question. I grew up in a british school so tonne is the only one ive ever known 😭
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,Samesies
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"That’s amazing! It definitely is scary to be on meds, especially considering that there isn’t a bunch of research on the long term effects of stimulants on developing brains (I consider mine to still be developing 😬).
 I’m the first in my family to pursue a diagnosis and get medication so it’s been hard navigating it and trying to explain it to my family as well. I’d love to learn some of your alternative lifestyle tips and strategies, if you’re willing to share :)"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"Yes definitely. Also, I give into the nap. So I wake up an hour early, take the med, then sleep for another hour. 


I highly suspect physical activity would help, and many people on this sub have said it does, but unfortunately I do not exercise regularly right now."
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,American here. We still stubbornly refuse to use the metric system anyway.
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,What are some places in day-to-day living that you’re looking for mechanisms?
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"My executive dysfunction is definitely my biggest obstacle. I know what I need to do, I know whats good for me, I know how to do it too, but I just cannot get myself to actually do it. I wasn’t able to overcome that through sheer willpower - I would push through for like 2/3 tasks and then be too exhausted to maintain that momentum. I assumed that medication was the only way to be able to work through it, but i’d appreciate if you had any ideas or strategies regarding that."
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"I was taught NEVER to use willpower (unless last resort) think of Mary Poppins, spoonful of sugar song…

Let me ask you are there things you are personally interested in that you have no problem performing?"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"I struggle with doing things i enjoy too. I’m really into nail art and making press on nails, I have all the supplies in my bottom drawer within reach, and frequently think about starting it again but can’t find the mental energy to. Other day-to-day things like laundry and cleaning my room are a little easier because there’s the consequence of my mum getting upset with me about a messy room or undone laundry. :("
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"Then there’s probably an underlying issue like depression (to be treated) 

You could be an incompatible environment or just in a inappropriate lifestyle for you


Before trying to get yourself to do the things you don’t like, try to regain the fire for what you do

Once you can manage that you want to use your passion to burn both your obligations and fulfillment

Think of ways to combine the things you don’t like to do with the things you do


However, if you’re struggling with even your passion, there’s a foundational issue"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"thank you! I’ll definitely work on trying to do things that come a little more naturally to me and are enjoyable, which should be easier now that the uni semester is ending. I’ll also consult my physician about this, you might be right about the depression aspect. I appreciate your advice! thank you again :)"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,Is there anything else you would like to know?
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"No problem, the world is more complex for people like us, we have to be there to help each other, good luck to you"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"Another possibility is that when you start doing the nails, you might enjoy it, but you might beat yourself up about starting it

It’s not the project itself it’s the cycle of self whipping and procrastination 

But I don’t know you it might also just be that you’re losing the fire for the activity itself"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"One last thing I’d love to get your 2 cents on is Rejection Sensitivity Dysphoria. It seems to be common amongst ADHD folk and i definitely find myself relating to it, and I’m wondering if you have any advice regarding that."
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"facts, i guess i’ll never know until i try it. The stars seem to have aligned perfectly because my finals are ending soon and I’ll practically have time off until september to work on myself and learn to get back into things i enjoy :)"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"Let me Google this term

I guess that makes sense because we are emotionally disregulated and everybody hates rejection 

I think meditation and practicing self-love and gratitude is a place to start 

(Yoga for example helps me) 

I like to think of Arthur’s sword, when you put yourself out there, you’re going to pull on many swords, but only some are meant for you 

And some are meant for an older more experience version of you 

I like to think that you should focus on the swords that you manage to pull and not give too much attention to the swords you can’t pull (people you can’t impress) 

I’d like to go to conventions and cosplay a little something about me 

At every convention I find I will have maybe 100 positive interactions 

But I find that I let the one negative interaction linger in my mind 

Statistically, that seems insane 

So I practice focusing my attention on the hundred positive interactions, and being grateful for them 

I hope this is helpful"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"If there’s a third thing, I’m happy to answer"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"Just be gentle, don’t throw yourself into a wall of expectations

Try to ease yourself into some good catharsis. Good luck"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"This definitely is helpful, poor memory definitely plays a big part in forgetting the positives and hyper-focusing on negatives. I cannot thank you enough for your time, advice, and insight. It’s so reassuring to hear that you’ve been able to live a rich life without meds and have learnt to manage yourself. 

Thank you! These are all the questions I have for now. Wishing you an incredible day and life ahead, you’re amazing.  :)"
What is being medicated like? What’s a typical day in your life with ADHD?,"I will definitely try to be gentle and take it slow, this was some amazing advice and I truly cant thank you enough. Good luck to you too! <3"
