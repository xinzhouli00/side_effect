"If this is a big change in your memory, talk to a doctor"
Could be something else
But focus and memory are of course issues with ADHD too
"

Do you take notes? I resisted taking handwritten notes for years because I couldn't write legibly quickly, and I didn't have a habit of it"
But I learned that hand-written notes slow me down so my brain actually retains more
Translating thought to words to handwriting gives me more time to make sense of what I'm learning
"I don't often go back to the notes and read them unless I need something specific, but that's fine since it helps so much with my retention"
"

I also have a system for myself to capture and manage anything I need to follow up on based on my handwritten notes."

Vitamin C makes most of the stimulants stop absorbing properly in your stomach
"Just take the stuff a few hours after your meds

For the record, vitamin C does not work the way you think it works"
Vitamin C conflicts with ADHD meds by blocking them from being absorbed into your body
It's fine to take them a few hours after you take your meds
Once your meds are in your bloodstream you're good.
Nurse here
 Keep your filthy hands off your face
 90 percent of colds and flu are spread by touching your face with contaminated fingers.
"My understanding is It impacts absorption, and especially release rate for extended-release meds"
But only if they're both taken together
But talk to your doctor and/or pharmacist about it and they can recommend the best way to manage both together.
I don't want to hammer to much on OP as I don't know the situation however this kinda sounds a bit like a placebo effect in some cases
Or like a self fullfilling prophecy
"You think you will get sick if there are some sick people aroung you, but when you take the vitamin then that doesn't happen.

So that could also mean that you don't actually get sick that often, but that you make yourself sick in a sense"
That would also explain why the vitamin has such a drastic effect
"(Not saying the Vitamin has no effect, but the cases it prevents might not happen if you don't already believe you are going to be sick because you are near sick people)"

And like I expect this shit to get downvoted but that doesn’t mean anything since I’m criticizing a lot of the ppl here tbh
If you have strong feelings about it no matter which way please comment bc the votes or upvotes doesn’t make me think about anything at all other than I’m right
I see a lot of posts of people blaming completely unrelated shit on their ADHD or saying ADHD is preventing them from this or that
It’s a bit excessive.
"Right, like I feel that It definitely DOES impact a lot of things but using it as a crutch just makes me feel like the things I actually struggle with that are directly related to ADHD are completely worthless."

"Yes, don’t abuse that shit"
You can end up with Brain damage
It was a contributing factor to fucking up my life
Don’t just keep upping the dose
you can create psychological dependencies on stuff too btw
"so it will cause it to be less effective and have you more hyper focused on it 30 a day is a lot, and if you do it more than once a day that’s more than the recommended max dose (40)  what you need isn’t adderall it’s a way to deal with your issues without having medication"
it will be hard but talk to professionals to learn ways to deal with it and that way you’ll be good without it or at least better
and in that time you’ll reset your body so that when you start it again no only do you have tactics to focus and get stuff done without it but you will also have 15/20/30 hit much harder than it does no and therefore you will overall be much kore effective and productive

Take the same does for a week or so and if you feel the same and can't sleep then definitely talk to ur doctor and lower the dosage
Don't forget to always have breakfast and drink tons of water
"

If it'd help you mentally then talk to tour doctor asap but I'd suggest you give it a few days."
My vyvanse made me fall asleep
It was weird
It raised my blood pressure a bit and made me want to nap all day
Now that I’m reading this I think something is wrong with me? I’m so sorry OP you are going through this
My psychiatrist said to take my stimulants no later than 6:30 AM
Maybe set an alarm and take them at 6 am and see if that helps? How are you feeling other than being awake?
"Thank you! I will stick with it for now and see how I go! I had a small breakfast but maybe I need something a little more substantial I'll try that tomorrow!
I've drank water constantly all day because I've had the worst dry mouth 😂"
"I don't think there's anything wrong with you! It will effect us all differently it actually makes more sense that it made you sleepy honestly!

Oh wow mine said no later than 10am! I'll take them a little earlier tomorrow and see how it goes!

I feel really agitated and my anxiety is through the roof! But I was anxious about taking them at all so that could be a factor"
"Yeap, the dry mouth will probably get better and so will the lack of sleep"
"But again, if it doesn't, there are other options - meds wise and dosage wise"
I'd just give it some time
The first time i took a low dosage i've had side effects similar to yours and then in a few months i got a higher dose and had no side effects at all
Ur body might just need some time to adjust
I’m sorry! I’m sending you a virtual hug! I hope you feel better!
Yeh I thought that I did assume it was just because my body was getting used to it but my psychiatrist is clearly useless because she didn't warn me about any of this! Thankyou though you've definitely reassured me
I had a little bit of imposter syndrome thinking I don't really have adhd so the meds aren't working 😂
Thank you! 🥰

How do you make friends after struggling with relationships?

I think it's a matter of going one step at a time
"ADHD can often make us try and pursue many things at once, while not doing any of these things as thorough as we might would want to"
"This applies to our goals and our ways of thinking too, as far as my experience goes"
"As such, though, to make a disclaimer, your experiences may well differ from mine, but I'll let you know what is working well for me right now"
"

First step easily is working on emotional regulation"
"It's something that will not only help you think about what's next easier, but you'll also have an easier time understanding people around you and showing empathy"
"I strongly encourage seeking therapy, if possible for you"
"The therapist will help you to cognitively reframe your past and subsequently cope with difficulties you may have had.
Second up is looking into meds"
"Noticing improvement on yourself as a result will really help your self-esteem! Also check, while you are doing this, if you have any deficiencies, like Vitamin D, B12 or if your thyroid has any issues"
"Get yourself physically checked out! 
Third step is getting fit"
Exercises that train your physical condition will also help you with your ADHD symptoms
"This could mean, for example, hitting the gym regularly (and getting a workout routine from a trainer there that fits your physique) or doing something else like hiking that really gets your body worked out"
Don't overdo it however; excessive workout will harm more than do good
"
Lastly, find a hobby you enjoy, no matter what it is, and make it an effort of yourself to engage with the community surrounding it"
Don't let people tell you IRL hobbies are better than online stuff; YOU know better than anyone else what you like to do in your spare time! And I can assure you that people are out there interested in similar stuff
There always are
"It's on you to figure out how to find and engage with them, but that is honestly much less a problem than what it initially sounds like"
"

You got this."

How do I put myself in a sleeping routine

I take 20mg of melatonin at bedtime
 Works for me.
"Have you talked to a doctor about your sleep issues? Sleep issues are often comorbid with ADHD, but may need separate treatment"
"

Perseveration (getting stuck in that hyperfocus) can take specific techniques to combat"
"It's hard, because it requires noticing and deciding to try and combat it"
"A therapist, or possibly an ADHD coach can help you figure out what might work for you.

I don't have any magic techniques that work for everyone"
Different stuff works for different people
"

Here's the specific combination that is working for me, but I've had to continually adjust and tweak it when it starts to slip.

1"
Digital Wellness settings that start locking me out of things later in the day
I have a no screens rule starting 2 hours before bedtime
"No lit screens of any kind, and nothing that gets me too engaged"
I sometimes think of this as my boring-stuff-only time
"It's tempting to just override the settings, but I try to take a moment to ask myself why I set those rules in the first place before I proceed"
"My wife helps gently remind me of this as well.

2"
Yellow glasses I put on two hours before bed
"I don't know if blue light actually makes a difference (there are some differing study results) but even if it's just association, it helps me"
"It feels like the day is winding down.

3"
"Melatonin if I still feel like I'm not winding down, or my mind is still overactive"
Melatonin dosing is weird
"Different people respond best to different amounts, and taking too much can be worse than not taking enough"
For a long time I thought I didn't do well with Melatonin because I got this really bad restless understimulated feeling
"I was tired, but it's like I was fighting against it"
"On a whim, I tried a much much smaller dose, and it worked much better"
I take half a children's dose melatonin
"

4"
Exercise earlier in the day helps a ton
"

5"
Specific to me: Iron
I get restless legs syndrome when my iron gets slightly low
"I talked to a doctor about it and a blood test found that my iron was slightly low, so we tried boosting it, and it helped.

I've had friends who weren't able to get their sleep under control with this stuff though, and they needed to talk to a doctor, and in some cases needed to have a sleep study done."
Max recommended is 5 mg
I assumed it’s best not to OD
But I know it doesn’t doo too much bad
But when I take 2 of them I seem to feel soggy in the morning but I’m not sure if that’s from the melatonin
One wonders why they sell 10 mg doses or even [this](https://vitamaticusa.com/products/melatonin-60-mg-60-tabalets?variant=44387100688550&country=US&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAABPukZs3XUN3p_CVsaHmvKvD83eW5&gclid=CjwKCAiAl4a6BhBqEiwAqvrqupzDlcVs0_M5FsIvpPnvDIFIbBHAfb-WXZVfhzujqM5jwuAAj9SdZRoCswcQAvD_BwE)

It would be good once you're feeling up to it to try the therapy option :)
"Getting over that blank drawing page is an executive function nightmare, so I truly commend you for dreaming of learning how to draw! A true good luck to you, stranger 🤍

We all felt that grave imposter syndrome after being diagnosed"
I really did and sometimes still do
"Community is really important in overcoming those feelings, so you did good joining the subreddit in order to find some.

You did the right things"
You saw the right people who saw you as worth helping
"Your struggles are very much so real and valid, as those are what landed you in that doctor's office :) It's easier heard than believed"
"I don't think there's anything other people can say to make the imposter syndrome go away, but similar to clouds, they will eventually move on over"
Give it time :) Congrats on making progress on your mental health 🤍
Go for the therapy
"It’s okay to feel the way you do, I think we all have our own way of coming to terms with our diagnosis and what we think of it"
"Some of us feel relieved, calm, confused, or even upset, and some of us feel no change at all"
"I think a lot of us also get imposter syndrome, so it’s definitely not weird to question your disorder from time to time"
" 

It’s good that you went and got help for what’s going on, and are taking steps towards feeling better and towards reaching your goals <3 even if you’re not ready for therapy now, it is still a good consideration for the future."

I hire housekeepers to help! I don't compare my worst to other people's best
That's not helpful for anyone.
It is harder
"I can do things that make it a little easier, but I'm never going to be a great housekeeper"
"

My Roomba can do a much better job of vacuuming than I'm likely to, and it can run every day if I want"
"

Not everything has a Roomba-equivalent option"
"I know I'm unlikely to spontaneously feel like taking care of chores like those, so I schedule them at times when I'm generally more likely to be able to do them, and schedule it often to make it less of a big ordeal each time"
Like cleaning the shower
Cleaning it very quickly and slapdash every Sunday morning during my morning shower works great
I even got bulk bathroom cleaner so I'm not running out all the time
"

I know I'm not going to be able to do things the same way as others"
"But if I accept that, I can find my own way to get it done if I need to."
They did not keep their houses like that
"It was for TV.

Also wealthy people have hired house cleaners, maids and butlers for that work."
So..
"are you a guy or a girl? Let's not forget most women are taught from a young age to be perfect and keep everything tidy up. 


Anyway, I just accept it"
It does not bother me
"Organization makes me feel better, but I try not to be hard on myself."
Man I don’t know
"I used to be so clean and tidy with my things (well at least my room) when I was a kid and then I was able to keep things nice for a couple months every so often, and now I can’t keep up with it all"
"I feel like I need a week to catch up on cleaning stuff, and then a few extra days to set things up to make it possible to maintain it"
I do think a lot of it has to do with being poor and not having as much time to do things as other people.
I relate so fucking hard esp w being obsessed with vacuuming and having two dogs in WINTER!!!!!!
"Start from the realization that a LOT of our cultural ideas about ""how life should be"" are based more on decades of advertising campaigns than they are on human necessity.

The spotless house - sponsored by the cleaning industry

Women shaving their legs daily - brought to you by razor manufacturers"
Just accept it.
Im poor but at this point im convinced i'd save money in the long run if i hired cleaning help say bi-weekly
I'd probably start cleaning more myself just so I don't have to be embarrassed when they come by to clean lol.
This is my goal once I get financially stable enough!
Not all girls are taught how to manage a house
" When you have generational mental health issues, things that are normal for other people just don't happen in your house"
" You get used to the chaos, and if you don't have any competent role models growing up some kinds of knowledge don't get passed down.

But it's always assumed that it's the woman's fault if you go to someone's house and it's untidy"
" People always assume that it's her responsibility, even if she's a working, full time student and the only one bringing in any income."
I WISH I was one of the girls that was taught that growing up 😭 instead I got parents who were also bad at cleaning 🙃
"If I had money, I would have some sort of cleaning service, a closet, and just things that would make sense for storage with adhd"
But I live in a studio apartment.
"Thats exactly what happens with me! 


I can always count on my laundry being clean and put away before my housekeeper comes. "
Rejection dysphoria has its perks lol
"Last time i did a deep clean at home was probably this summer when our building had scheduled maintanence of the sewage pipes or sum shi.

Tried making plans to invite people home for set dates to motivate myself but i think you can probably guess how that went lol."

I can't either
My wife has generally accepted that conversation needs to take a pause when we get near complex navigation areas
"If I notice we're chatting and I need to concentrate, or if I miss a turn and realize I need to pay attention so I don't keep missing more turns, I'll ask if we can talk about it later so we can actually arrive at our destination"
"  
She gets it"
"Often she notices before I do now.

Or sometimes we just take a very scenic and indirect route because we're really into our conversation"
"

But it's ok to tell people why you're not engaging in conversation"
"It's your issue, so own it"

I have a Snorlax bean bag that has all the laundry
Wish I could lay on it sometimes.
"To find a solution, figure out what stops you from putting away the clean laundry.

I realized that I avoided it because took too much time"
"I used to match and roll up pairs of socks, fold underwear, sort my hanging clothes by color or use (work vs casual)"
It was just too much so now socks and underwear all get tossed into a basket
I do still hang shirts to avoid wrinkles but stopped micro organizing
"They just get hung up and I'm done.

I have 4 or 5 pairs of clean pants that have been sitting on the kitchen table for days"
I realized that I don't have enough drawer space so it's always frustrating trying to tetris everything in there
"So, time for a pants basket, no more folding!"
A chair and 2 puffs
I know ❤️
"So do I stack the five baskets in the chair and sit on the puff, or the other way around? 😀"
"Nope, stack a chair and the puffs in your bedroom to free up the sofa"
Then you could hide the mess lol

"if you’re anything like me, you’re used to having to explain your mindset or reasoning behind something which almost always seems to come across as argumentative combative or otherwise hostile"
I suppose in many cases were trained or program to expect people to not be happy with like what we’re doing and consequently feel like there’s a lot of value and explaining ahead of time what we were thinking and why we did what we did

"This is how I suspected having ADHD for the first time in my life : because eventhough I like to be organised, do the things in time with a proper management, etc, I was never ever able to do it, or maybe but at the cost of being EXHAUSTED.."
"I mean : I realised I might be ADHDer because my personality was not compatible with what I end up doing

I knew deep in my heart that I was not lazy and because everyone around me knows how I am a dead serious person that takes every work seriously with extreme care, that it was not a lack of will, but it just does not work...

I came to the conclusion that, after my brother got diagnosed, that it might be this condition...

and here I am getting myself diagnosed atm

This is the point I think of why ADHDers hate ADHD : bc it is a condition that makes them do things against how they wish to do them : being on time, organising tasks properly, list goes on

Keep it up !"

I have so much work but I can't stop moving

Break it down into small chunks
Set a timer for 5 min then try to add to this each time
Take a break and set another timer
Even 5 min can be productive

As someone dealing with the financial and physical consequences of not winning this specific struggle and i beg you to figure out any way you can to overcome it.
I’m lucky to have a kind ‘normal’ spouse who understands when I’m not capable
"Also, I do tasks that I don’t hate and he does tasks he doesn’t hate (they’re conveniently opposites of each other lol)"
He’s in the financial sector and I struggle with finances
"I told him I’m fine if he manages our money as long as I’m part of the conversation, have equal decision-making power and the same access he has"
It works well
He’s a brainiac at that stuff
"

Here’s a teeth brushing hack: brush your teeth in the shower while you’re letting conditioner soak in your hair"
It saves you the thousand mile trip (10 ft in reality) to the bathroom sink
"

Also- Qelbree is a game-changing med that I’ve been on"
It’s non stimulant and lasts all day.
"your comment literally motivated me, I promise to take care of my oral hygiene from now on, tysm

I wish you all the best"

YouTube needs an ADHD setting

I feel like Youtube used to do this? Maybe I'm misremembering...
"add them to your watch-later playlist, remove them after you watch"
"My watch-later playlist has a stockpile of hundreds of videos I can just leave on auto-play, and I add new videos from the suggestions as new ones pop up"
"There's a ""new to you"" filter somewhere that shows you only things you haven't seen."
The ADHD setting is me saving the videos to a playlist and putting videos I’m watching on the 1.5x speed option.
Same with tiktok! Keeps showing me the same content creators over and over even though I follow like 2k accounts
Click 'new to you' on your recommended page
Or the 'recently uploaded' one.
Omg
The new Spotify DJ needs this too!
"Oh God that adhd response of maybe I'm misremembering, I swear I say that more often than not"
I kinda do too
Now it's just new stuff or videos I've recently watched
Give me the stuff from years past that I forgot and would totally rewatch!
"I do this, but I'm talking about what the home page shows me"
"It makes sense how they do it, but not for me (I attribute this to ADHD)"
"

Like, I want to be shown stuff I have forgot exists"
"For example, I used to watch airplane stuff about a year ago"
"I then moved on but when I'm bored would love to see that kinda old interest stuff come up to remind me that it's a thing I am interested in.

Sorry for the word salad, just trying to make sure I'm understood 😅"
Yup
I know better than to trust my junkbox called a memory
"I have a loooot of Youtube playlists and some of them are to highlight ""oldies, but goodies"" in my personal YouTube video hall of fame haha"
"The feeling of lack of true novelty on Youtube is very real though, I relate"
I guess that's it
The lack of novelty
"That actually makes me feel a bit better about it, thanks 😊"
"Yes! If you're interested, you can research the ""4 pillars of motivation"" for ADHD"
"I think it's something like:

4 pillars of motivation:
1"
"Novelty
2"
"Interest
3"
"Competition
4"
"Pressure

(Snagged from my notes archive haha)

I thiiiiink there's an order? I,e you're more likely to reach for something if it's Novel (1st place) vs due to pressure (4th place – think things like deadlines or the Last Minuteisms of ADHD like deadlines or not eating until you're absolutely crawling to the fridge from weakness haha)

This is really useful for _me_ though, I just keep forgetting it exists 😬 typical haha"
"Ooh! I might just put this on my wall so I don't forget.

My current hyper fixation fits this well"
Unfortunately you can only watch so many videos on Goldfish 😂
"And you know what? I should put it on my wall too! 😂😂 Ah yes mirroring, haha.

For some reason I have recently fallen into a slight ""science youtube"" rabbit hole and I'm sure the lexical field of goldfish, aquariums and pet care videos will follow me soon.."
It shall be my turn to hyperfix on goldfish haha
Glad the pillars helped! It was truly eye opening when I found it
Science YouTube is a fun place! And it leads to so many different places
I still get Neil DeGrasse Tyson shorts pop up and I absolutely love listening to him
He's so passionate.

Perfect example

You can't make me!
I appreciate this but this is like my first day off off in a while and I wish to be a burrito for one day.
"You lost me at ""get up"""
You understand we know what to do right? We have problems executing not with not knowing what we should be doing.
Instructions unclear
"Tried to find a clock app on my laptop, found Reddit, and here we are, two hours of scrolling later.

Seriously, if it were that simple, I'd have figured it out decades ago"
"Unfortunately, it's not, and your advice isn't any better than ""just try harder"", which I'm sure 99.9% of people on this sub have had more than enough of."
i brushed my teeth for the first time today!
I need to shower
No
But I just fed the cats and had some milk 😭
"Shit, is that all?! My god—I’m cured!

Bless you, bless you, o miracle worker!"
"Literally thought ""clock app"" meant tiktok"
"
Send help"
No
I'm going to bed.
"Some people in here give me the “im adhd!!!!”  vibe and not enough giving “I have adhd”

Learn ways to manage your symptoms don’t let them become you, guys"
I get we have issues starting and stopping
This is someone’s hack that works for them and they’re sharing it
"

We also know that a momentum effect can happen when it wants to"
So what if getting that glass of water or quick stretch is the kick in the butt you needed?
Nuh uh 🙂‍↔️
Ok
I’ll forget lol.
"Stop doom scrolling and do this instead:

Take a deep breath"
Look at me
Follow my finger from left to right
Feel your body relax
Now lick your smartphone display
"Yes, you heard me right! Open wide and lick that phone! Taste the void! French-kiss the machine.

LICK IT!



Ewwww, wtf is wrong with you! Go brush your mouth! Ew!"
"BWAHAHA! If a stretch and a glass of water could ""clear my mind"" I'd be the most flexible hydrated woman you ever met."
"I literally read this, looked at my ""4 month paper"" and laughed 😂"
OP has to be banished from this sub
Maybe tomorrow…
"Ok, I’m doing it now."
I do pebbling with my children but don't get responses to often
"They have families so I have to be understanding, which doesn't help with the lonliness."
"I actually saw this tip in this sub: iPhone has a “ringer” option called stop playing - when the timer goes off, it stops playing whatever is playing on your phone, shuts off the screen, etc"
it’s great for that - I only want to scroll for 5-10 minutes
"I also use it in the shower - when the music stops, it’s time to get out"
I wish 🤣🤣🤣
"This is unironically the best advice for ADHD I've ever received, I'm surprised.
Congratulations I guess, and thanks btw."
"I skimmed half of this post, am leaving a comment now, and will be continuing along with my scrolling."
!!!!!!
Same
I’ve been on the couch bed rotting since I worked multiple double shifts this week and today I’m not medicated and laying on the couch with snacks and naps
I read the op and I was like oh oopsies I “forgot” I’m supposed to operate like I don’t have adhd…
Exactly
My bf asked if I was going to “sit around all day”
Fucking YES that’s exactly what I’m doing
Byeeeeee
Sometimes I just need someone/chat gtp to tell me exactly what I need to do in what order.
Just because it doesn't work for you doesn't mean it doesn't work for anyone else
"🤷‍♀️ Some people need an outside person to tell them to do things to feel like they can, and that's totally valid."
If reminders worked for me I would genuinely hire someone to live in my house and just tell me what to do every day.
I hate these stupid ‘reminders for adhd people’ that people post on social media and then are so proud of themselves.
they’re doing it to make themselves feel good and like it’s harmless (except further reinforces people’s misconceptions about adhd) but really annoying and makes me more anxious about not doing those things
"What are some of your strategies? Bcs almost everywhere online just says ""schedule your time"" and ""pomodoro"" which I've tried both, and I still timeblock, just can't implement tho"
"Hopefully you aren't that old then, since it was your first time and all"
I feel this
"I like to play YouTube videos in the shower, especially stand up comedy"
Sometimes I just play music though
"

Showering is hard"
Especially when I want to stay dry
I've moved all my soaps and comb so I can reach them while sitting in the shower
"The less effort, the better."
Personally I'm sick of people telling me what I need to do
I already know 🥲
Yeah «just do it» is a very tiresome advice.

How do you tackle cleaning a messy apartment?

"It feels daunting, for sure"
"Especially when we have expectations, for ourselves, others"
I’ve noticed that tasks take up more space and time in my mind than the actual minutes they take to finish
The dishes
The laundry
"The spraying, wiping, setting, waiting, dirt sweeping, mopping"
I always think it will take ages
But it doesn’t
This surprises me still
"Yes, we need to pump ourselves up a bit and indulge before diving in, but just do a little, enjoy the satisfaction, and try to keep going at it"
It’s hardest to start
"Listening to a program, engrossing story, or entertaining podcast helps."
"Find some petrol and matches...![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)

"And bribe/reward you with chocolate...

Music works too (but need the right kind).
Start small
"Pick a spot, put on some music, and do what you can."
Throw it all out
Im serious.
2 garbage bags full so far 😅

Hello fellow late-diagnosed ADHDer!  Getting diagnosed and treated has been a game changer for me
 It makes life a lot easier
 Still difficult and I still have all the same problems but they just aren’t always insurmountable obstacles that they used to be!
"Getting laid off work sucks man I'm sorry that happened but now you have a diagnosis employers will have to give leniency, I've been late a few times recently and work output dropped but employer was cool with it as they understand especially with the medication shortage plus it's protected under disability act in UK.

What line of work are you in?"
"The director I work with knows I have ADHD and am currently on treatment which makes me more productive, but I have created structures as well like mental breaks when I feel overstimulated"
It's hard but having a supportive job is important.
"Hi, I'm really sorry you're going through this"
"I, too have struggled my entire life with this general idea that something was different about me. 

I was put in the GATE (Gifted & Talented Education) program after a Teacher wanted my intelligence tested"
"I don't remember much about how I was in school at the time and what led my Teacher to recommend it. 

The results were 142"
"I had NO IDEA what that meant, and recall the Psychologist telling Mom that 'something else was going on, he just didn't have time that day for more testing'"
We got in the car
I asked how I did and what it meant
"Mom replied something along the lines of 'he said you're smart, but I think he just liked you.."
"'  I never did return for further testing. 

In my later 40's & 50's, my memory was really bad"
"If I was told something, I just couldn't retain the information"
Writing it down or seeing the info made it easier to recall or 'see' the info
"Constantly not remembering dates, appointments, even promises. 

In 2014 my Dad had Alzheimer's and Mom was diagnosed less than 2 yrs later"
This made me worry more about my memory
"My Dr agreed to have me tested. 

My memory's fine, that is IF I close my eyes and concentrate on what's being said"
Ms Tester specialized in memory issues but diagnosed me with Executive Disfunction with ADHD with the possibility of autism instead
"She suggested I be tested by someone else who tests for those things (AuADHD & ExDys) No, I haven't gotten to it yet.

So, just before turning 60, I finally have a name for what I've dealt with my whole life.

Those around me aren't interested in hearing about yet another condition I've been diagnosed with"
I've lived with chronic pain and fatigue for 20+years
"The list of surgeries, medications and diagnosis is very long and folks are tired of hearing about it all. 

So I'm alone to grieve the loss of the life that I couldn't make happen and the anger that came with it"
"Alone to look back and the see signs that had been there all along, but my physical ailments took precedence over the well-being of my mind.


Because of posts like yours, I realize I'm not alone, there are other people out there in the world, you,  struggling right along beside me and that I am not unique.  Either are you"
"I feel better knowing this all and I hope this makes you feel a bit better too.


I'm here...you're not alone 💕"
"Well hopefully future employment will be better with an official diagnosis.

I'm also a software engineer and went through a similar situation last year and was out of work for almost 3 months as had fallen behind with learning new design patterns etc and the feeling was awful.

I hope you stick with software I think it's a great career with most flexibility like remote working and flexi time etc but I understand if you don't enjoy it anymore and want to go into a new career, I wish you all the best for the future!"
"Thanks for the support and acknowledgment!

I had a burst of ""relief energy"" immediately after the diagnosis"
I was able to look back on my life with a new lens and things that just baffled me started to make sense
"I have been reading, just on chapter 3, ""Delivered from Distraction"", but chapter 2 made me weep and yell out, ""YES!!""

That energy ran out after a bit, and now.."
the hard work starts!
"Well, you have to HAVE a job to get leniency"
"I don't think it counts as a disability in the US, and frankly many of my peers have it - Software Developer - it's almost expected you'll have some kind of ""quirk"".

There's also a lot of shame and negative focus (as opposed to the superpowers) when you talk about it here.

I started out as a Mechanical, then Industrial, then Civil Engineer, going into SW development self-taught for the last 20 years"
"Before SW, I was considering being a contractor, and ""for fun"" I've built things over the years leading to a holy-crap-I-did-that? cabin"
"

The reason I'm having a good day is that my new.."
GF? suggested I become a handyman
"I opened to that today, and think it could be a viable career-shift for me"
"Doing shorter projects with high variety is appealing right now, as opposed to sitting at a desk for (another!) 3 years on a project that never ships"
And you can't ask AI to change out your faucet! 😉
"As the environment became more abusive at my last place (literal yelling, throwing things), my masking ability degraded and my productivity just tanked"
"I pride myself on exchanging my time for their money, so that sent me on a sh\*t spiral.

When I'm in a healthy place, I've found that I can get away with a bit of pacing in a large conference room, and always accepted my ""quirky dude"" label."
"I got to the end, and had goosebumps shivers"
You are seen
"

It's been a lifelong struggle for me, too"
"My mantra is ""Everything that happened, got me to be here, today"""
"No regrets, despite the pain and suffering"
"I made a list of things to do today, and won't do most, because responding to Reddit takes time"
"I go easy on myself now, and I recommend it if you can.

I also close my eyes to concentrate"
"😂 Yeah, you're not alone, either.

I was clever - the IQ tester had the answers and I could read upside down - DUH! I'm sure I scored high, but I did not know the opposite of feline was canine in the 4th grade! They put me in the Gifted & Talented program with the real smart kids and freaked out - but there was a teletype in the room that I had free-reign to use, and took advantage of it"
"

My ""uncle"" said I should be an engineer, so I became one"
"When something interested me, I got a degree in it, and then a job, until I got bored and my performance tanked"
"I became a Solar Panel expert this spring, and now it's boring (they just work and don't need tinkering!?!?)"
"I've become a Swiss Army Knife in a world that wants spoons with 20 years experience being that.

So, with new information, how are you doing on your path forward? Much support & love! 💕"
Thanks! I appreciate the words of support
"Sounds like you had a similar experience with your awful feelings - and I need to choose to get back in the game if I want to rejoin.

On the one hand, not using my valuable skills would be a bummer, but on the other - if I'm completely honest - I've never, ever loved it"
"Software has always been a tool to make things happen, and I've struggled with all the patterns and practices of it all"
"I'm an engineer, not not a software engineer"
"Solve the problem, and move on"
"I tend to butt heads with the purists.

On the other, I once answered ""Open a bar!"" when asked where I wanted to be in 20 years\*"
"That was over 30 years ago, so maybe it's time for a new path"
"I love creating bespoke things, and making people delighted by solving their problem in a way only I can with my deep catalog of knowledge and experience"
"My favorite job, ever, was a fry-cook in the college cafeteria - handing hungry people freshly made food they crave always lead to a happy customer"
I just need to find a way to make people happy and pay the bills..

"The issue is that the DEA has not changed any of their regulations, just a tack on that says the telehealth rule has been extended"
 It creates a worry in many pharmacies and providers that there could be some liability sitting in that contradiction
 So everyone is working on different rule sets based on their idea of what the contradiction could mean.
There's been a lot of shady telehealth prescribers popping up over the last few years
"Social media ads encouraging sign ups, monthly sub fees and easy access.

Pharmacist likely seeking to limit their legal liability exposure.

My psychologist is mandating in person visits at least once a year for any patients she writes stimulant scripts for."
"Yea dude, some pharmacies are staffed by Jr DEA agents"
"I worked in a bank, so we were trained on risk management, and detecting fraud"
But these guys just seem to do it arbitrarily / just straight up discriminate
"I say that because Im a dark skinned Latino male and if I go in in athleisure clothes, Ive gotten the techs grilling me"
"2 months ago, they asked me that I was using my own insurance! If I go in dressed like a Brooks Brother, and especially if I bring my GF with me, they talk to me sweet"
"I guess they think that McGruff the Crime Dog is gonna come out and give them an honorary badge and take a pic with them for ""sniffing out crime"""
And the telehealth thing annoys the hell outta me
"I am in my 20s, but I prefer meeting face to face, in their office"
"But after COVID, many doctors never went back to in person visits"
Only telehealth
"Like sorry, I dont own their practice, I cant force them to meet me in person."
">Pharmacist likely seeking to limit their legal liability exposure.

Help me understand"
"Who is going to sue them? Will the FDA go there and say you've prescribed far too many! Is adderall some ingredient used for opioids?

I suppose if some teen abuses it and dies because of too many adderall in system, but we haven't even heard of any of such issue.

What is the liability exposure"
"Did someone die or sue the pharmacy big time?? Rite Aid for example, almost went bankrupt but I doubt this was the main root of it.

Once a year physical interviews are good I'm all for it"
"But I just don't understand how everything seems to be how it is now.

I also don't understand the discrimination patients get treated with, I understand being a pharmacist is difficult especially because of the job cuts but it's as they're treating someone different like they're not humans at all"
Everyone needs to chill
I think telehealth makes everything so much better but this also may sound like the companies wanting to force people to go back to the office.
DEA can take their license
DOJ can prosecute
“Adderall and Mydayis[10] are trade names[note 2] for a combination drug containing four salts of amphetamine.”

Have you tried medication? There's no need to force yourself when you can get help.

I'm poor and my bills suck up most of my income

"I’m currently on a generic of Adderall due the Vyvanse shortages — it’s alright.

However, I have taken Phentermine in the past for weight loss"
(It helped me a lot actually!) Isn’t it typically used for short term? I guess I never knew it could be used for ADHD.
I was surprised too! Because doctor was like it’s weight loss drug but it helps with ADHD
I guess it was one of the reasons I was hesitant to pick it up at the pharmacy
Also for adderall generics it’s tough
One manufacturer might be great and another would make me depressed and dysphoric
I know that branded one and Teva is great for me (actually even better than branded)
Worst one I’ve tried was Alvogen.
Interesting! Maybe that’s why I did so well on it
(besides for weight loss) I’ll have to keep that in mind if the shortages become more ridiculous!
Teva makes the branded one
And I agree all the fake ones suck.

I think you might be reading a lot into the opinion of a single random recruiter 😉
"Not sure how that’s discriminating, if anything a guide like this is a cheat code"
"

Thankfully we’re never early so we got that out of the way"
"

As for professionalism if I end up actually up leaving the house (😭)  I’m usually dressed very nicely so no problem there"
"

The no cigarette smoke is my challenge however I’d probably just end up getting a vape for the day depending on the career.

No divulging confidential information shouldn’t be hard, if that’s seriously a problem then another line of work where people wouldn’t need to trust you is in order."
Those top three don't sound like they're ADHD patterns particularly
"Even if the top three red flags were poor organization, poor working memory, and poor sense of time, I wouldn't assume it's deliberate"
"All else being equal, those do make do make us less effective on average"
"But the real world is more complex, and there are compensating factors that can help us be effective despite those challenges."
"I believe we were designed to be startup creaters for businesses, let someone else do the day to day hit the clock stuff"
We are creative whirlwinds who can hyperfocus and see the whole thing at the same time
At least that is my opinion.
The first one absoutely has dating advice vibes
"Though I can understand the social awkwardness of a receptionist having to stare at you, or the person who’s going to interview you having to walk past you like six times, possibly with someone else they’re interviewing"
"That would make sense, as my mind is a bit 'over active' - and i bet you or your friends can relate!

That said, as a job-developer myself, these three are huge 'obvious' things to look for"
This article isn't anything new
"That said, this is really the tip of the iceberg"
"

Fortunately, blue-collar / trade-style jobs do not have the same interviewing requirements"
To counter myself on this: homeless shelters (also worked in a few of those) are totally FiLLED with ADHD folk that simply broke down physically..
"or used too much recreational medications in order to keep their mind in check.

If you have ADHD you will see the 'Big Picture' and have seen what i am talking about? You are right though - this is a single, um, 'random recruiter'"
But perhaps it isn't so random.
"Without Concerta i tend to be on time for one (1) thing each day, usually by two or more hours so as to beat traffic"
"It feels like 'professionalism' is designed to erase all originality and 'flavour' that i have (for example, i adore my Bugs Bunny tie - and people don't even wear ties anymore!)"
Even my language tends to be quirky unless i am in enough stress to drop into hyper focus
"

It really hurts me to control myself where i fit this relatively 'common sense' list"
"The conformity is a requirement ('if you cannot fit into the round hole, how will your proverbial peg fit a job for 10 - 50 years??'), i get that"
"

But it hurts me, it does"
Glad you are doing well though!
">startup creaters for businesses

But doesn't that imply that the whole business rests on our back therefore increasing the pressure of responsibility? (As in one mistake can have huge consequences, compared to being just a guy inside a company)."
"Conformity is absolutely NOT a requirement.

We place wayyyyy too much emphasis on jobs and careers in hopes they “pick us” or “keep us” when in reality they would be blessed to have us.

Of course interviews are stressful & nerve-wracking for most, but if you feel you can’t be yourself in an interview then you’re not at the right job"
"

Your personality will almost always reveal itself, and if it doesn’t you’re going to be miserable being someone you’re not"
"This is the reason we (adhders) become entrepreneurs.

Wear the bugs bunny tie, be yourself"
You sound like a fun person to be friends with imo.

Have you tried the not pro Airpods? Those are the only in ear headphones I can work with
I hate the pros because they make my ears hurt too.
i haven't because i had the apple earbuds that were wired and couldn't handle the hard plastic after a while

Do other ADHDers also wanna learn EVERYTHING?

I’m a half-assed expert on many things these days.
I generally have an obsession with discovering the details of EVERYTHING
This has lead me to have an indepth knowledge of history and also video games
"However it has worked against me, like not being in the moment in current situations. "
Sometimes
"I’ve seen it appropriately referred to on here as “compulsive learning.”  What you’re dealing with sounds more like hyperfixation, though."
I know everything but pretty superficially
Like… I tried everything in my life
"The only thing I’m really good at is research 😂
I got obsessed with so many things throughout my life"
I spend month-two to know everything I can about it just to completely loose any interest at some point
I don’t know any topic really in-depth
For sure I know more than most of people as they mostly have some better knowledge in limited amount of topics
But I don’t know as much as them in their topic
It’s frustrating because I don’t have enough skills and knowledge in anything to make money of it
Can I please stop at some point? 😭😭😭 I don’t even need all this info.
I wanna learn everything but what I have to study for lol
"Yeah, this is the reason why when someone asks me about my hobbies I always answer I have one hobby : collecting hobbies"
😅
Yes
"These last few months I signed up for three different courses and I obviously couldn’t do it all, but I tried lol"
I just want to learn everything I can
Absorb all the information I see
"I have this problem where I become well above average, but not great or amazing at things then just drop it and pick up something new lol"
i strongly relate to this
"its a burning interest, but diving deep into many topics is difficult"
it feels like i am aggressively grabbing the low hanging fruit from a topic then moving on to a next
"(take this with grain of salt, i am not diagnosed)

edit: part of it for me is going full force into it and wanting to learn it super quick then abandoning it, whereas if i had a more sustained effort over a period of months i could probably end up learning way more"
I do but with mostly within the biology field
"I can’t decide what I actually want to do and just end up bouncing around, adding and changing majors and minors to fit my most recent whim."
"Yes, and so I’ve decided to cut out most of the things, and to focus the next little while on just a couple things"
"“I have my whole life to learn Spanish” is kind of the attitude I need to take. 
Realizing that I spread myself so thin and task saturate I’ve also made a list of my daily priorities"
Using recurring Apple reminders has helped me as well. 
"Yes, I read nonfiction effortlessly, but fiction requires a hell of a lot of effort"
I want to learn everything but revise nothing
Bring me new things please
Yes absolutely
It took me almost 7 years to finish college because I changed my major and dropped out several times
I never understand people who say they’re always bored if they’re not working
"If I didn’t have to work, I would spend all my time doing my hobbies and learning languages and reading and playing sports and honestly probably also going back to school to learn new things"
Im horrible with decisions
My gcse picks were half Arts and half computing
Then for a-levels i continued doing computing but abandoned art for humanities
"I initially wanted to be a teacher so i could make use of that range of knowledge (but had to drop out of uni bc depression).

I still do art, i dabble in music, sometimes i write, i code for fun, i know how to crochet and i’m really good at maths.

And NONE of it is useful to me"
"Executive dysfunction means i can’t monetise any of it, and I don’t have the qualifications nor the mental stability for most jobs.

I got to learn so many things, i’m capable of learning so many things, but i’m not reaping any rewards of being the jack of all trades bc basic life skills is the thing im the worst at.

I get the “scrolling ur life away”"
I can’t even hold art commissions because i can never get myself to draw what i want to
Its like having wings made of stone
They’re supposed to fly me away but they’re so heavy they make it worse
Sorry thats a bit depressing
I think it gets better
"At least, i’m gonna try and sort out all my other problems first."
"![gif](giphy|ZFJYcVE5lYvWE)

I drink and I know stuff."
yup.
"Yup, I generally do.

I did well in school (trauma and other stuff) but still used to think the same about being a wealthy white guy a couple centuries back"
"They got to learn what they found interesting across fields and topics, and when they thought of something interesting or invented something, it actually became a thing rather than dying with them"
"Plus, they had less to learn and more to discover in pretty much every field, though some wouldn't have been proper or permissible."
"jack of all trades master of none, yes I relate."
"I do that, for sure.."
"like a lot.

But I feel like it's being cast as overwhelmingly negative on this thread"
 It's all about how you frame it
" ""Jack of all trades master of none, though oftentimes better than master of one.” Don't focus on the first part, reflect on the second.

I'm not saying you should let the hyper fixation take over your life, not at all"
" Work on oppositional defiance by making small goals, and getting back up when you drop that habit"
" Evaluate your goals, and be purposeful  in setting them and regularly re-evaluating"
" Work on progress, one step at a time.

I look at my litany of non applicable skills in a positive light"
" I have confidence I can figure stuff out in the moment, and do what's needed"
 I also lean on that bank of knowledge if I'm training or explaining something to someone
" I dip into that pool and use it to create a metaphor to help someone connect the dots, or make some silly mnemonic to help my recall"
"I for sure struggle to keep the train on the tracks, but balance is hard, in all things.

You're becoming a deep, interesting person"
" Give yourself grace, and you'll head in the direction you intend, the path might just be more squiggly than you'd like"
" You got this, and I'm proud of you for having the guts to put something like this into the world."
Oh my gosh this is so f'ing relatable right now
"I have a law test I need to study for my career and for some reason I can't force myself to do that, the thing I actually need to do that's important.."
"I'd rather study geography and learn Chinese instead???

Why am I like this"
I definitely do
"I think for me it's semi related to our disability, because trying to focus or organise is so hard, so I think about other interests and collect them all with the idea that I can stimulate my brain into being switched on, inspired and organised."
I consider myself a lesser polymath
I can't offer advice about not starving as I came close on a couple of occasions..
 I can't bring myself to learn something I don't want to
As I got older it kind of paid off because it makes me polyvalent and I have a better perspective than most
There is value in that
I once read that specialization is for insects
Breadth over depth.
I lament that life is such that you can never know it all
It’s a depressing reality to me.
Yes
I suspect it is something akin to hoarding
Maybe something about compensating for being chronically misunderstood or being perceived as dumb due to rather circuitous articulation techniques.
Yes
I used to want to be a rock star
Then a photographer
Then I audio engineer (recorded bands)
Then computer technician
Now I'm a software developer
Just ride the wave.
This is exactly why I’ve done MANY years of college and haven’t finished lol
I want to learn ALL THE THINGS and have changed my major a bunch of times.
I want to and DO learn everything
Will research everything in a single sentence idc lol
Baffles me when people can just continue about their day after seeing something or hearing something they don’t know and aren’t curious about it?? Or if people say “oh idk anything about that xyz topic” I’m like yea me neither join me on this research journey lmao
Yes
And it causes me decision freeze constantly
It's infuriating
"Enraging, even."
Yes
And it never changes.
"I did for the longest time, through high school and college especially, but since I’ve graduated I’ve lost the ability to learn anything at all it feels like"
"Been bothering me for like a year now, never can focus long enough or retain anything, and feel forgetful and dumb as hell now lol."
I struggle with this but it's not that I quickly learn some things off the top and jump to the next
I'll do a deep dive and hyper fixate on something for a month or a few
Sometimes I come back to the same thing eventually to hyper fixate on it again
I eventually get no excitement or happiness from doing something then I jump to something else
Yeah bro
"All the knowledge i have, i acquire"
PASSIVELY
I SUCK at learning
"Whenever try to do something i want, i almost ALWAYS hit a wall"
"When i dont, ill b lucky if i do it again"
Im lucky if i even start
I wish learning wasnt so frustrating amd defeating.
"Yes, I sometimes wish I could stay in undergrad forever and take tons of classes"
But I struggle with doing the work and readings and therefore learning so I'm not taking away as much as I could! It SUCKS!!!
Yes!! Life is so short and time is sooo limited but I rush head forward into everything and learn nothing
Totally
"I did well in school because of it, but it doesn't serve me well in other areas."
Of course
I definitely love learning
If I won the lottery I would take online classes for lots of things (except physics because physics is hard!)
"I'm like this, but youtube and books are enough to satisfy my curiosity"
"I chose a field that I deeply love, Computer Science, and I see myself absorbing new content about it almost every day -- I actually bring a ton of new ideas to my team because of that, despite being a new grad.

I know uni can sometimes suck and some subjects are quite boring, but ask yourself: is Physics one of your top 3 interests? One of my friends realized he liked music more than CS and dropped out after learning a lot about being a DJ."
Sometimes I wonder if we're all the same person in different bodies
I do
It’s a blessing and a curse.
Me!! I’ve never related to something so much! 🤍
Yes
There's a few things I like learning about a lot and others I like learning about casually
But always like learning something.
Naturally 💫
Not anymore
I plug into podcasts of history ...dan Carlin is great if you wanted to start somewhere the first series I listened to was supernova in the east on spotify
I know a little about a lot and don't remember most of it 😅
I have approximate knowledge of many things
My area of special interest was health care
 I got a degree in nursing in only 5 semesters.
Harry Potter and the Half-Ass Prince (if Snape had ADHD)
Your career can be Trivia Host lol
Preach!!

Give it some time
"If you don’t feel anything improving after about a week or two, your doctor may up the dosage"
"Everyone is different, some people do well on lower doses and some people need higher doses"
"At a good dose you should feel calm and clear minded, and be able to sustain your focus longer and motivation as well"
The biggest mistake some people make is falling for the euphoria trick as I call it
"It usually happens when you first start stimulants, but will wear off eventually once tour body is accustomed"
"Some people think it’s not working anymore if they don’t feel the euphoria, and technically that’s not what the medication is intended to do"
"So some people end up on a higher dose not really needing the higher dose, just chasing the euphoria feeling"
I usually do better on lower to mid range doses
"Also, concernta worked way better for me, adderall xr was too stimulating for me"
That’s just me though
It'll take a couple of weeks for the doctor to get your dose adjusted
 Give it time.
I was at first put on 15mg of extended release and didn’t feel much of a difference
I’m now on 20mg of quick release and I can definitely tell a huge difference
"Doesn’t fix all my issues, but it definitely helps my brain work right"
"Give it time, but you might just need a higher dose."
added some stuff to my post
Good luck with everything!
I’ve got two weeks before my follow up so I will keep note of how I feel
"I just want to know what effects I should reasonably expect because obviously, it’s not meant to be a cure"
Thank you!
Thank you for your insight!

there’s definitely been a lot of information or discussion about the value or impact that nutrition and diet plays on attention deficit disorder
I’m not a medical professional and I really don’t have much or any acknowledge on the combination of medications you take
"But you’ve eliminated some of the risk factors based on alcohol use, and things like that"
I would try and find a medical professional who is specializes in attention difference disorder and/or has a specialty or focus on nutrition and diet and/or has a partner who’s focused on nutrition and diet
frequently as I understand it ADHD comes with or can come with a number of other symptoms and issues and I think you need to know what you’re dealing with before you can figure out what the plan to combat it is
As another thought perhaps looking for a another ADHD specialist who could review your medication‘s with you might also help
Sometimes there can be interactions with medication’s at one person might not be aware of and just having somebody else with a neutralbias look at what you’re currently doing might be able to quickly suggest other things to consider or at least give you an alternative perspective.

Idk but I feel you
My pharmacy will run out of one and just fill the script with another
It’s awful
I usually end up getting nausea all over again and having strong food ick
Wish it weren’t like this.
"Patented release mechanisms in brand names that are different in generics, different fillers in brand and generic, etc.

Then there are genetic differences between people in terms of metabolism and sensitivity"
Then the difference in dose presence in extended release and non-extended meds combined with diet
"Did the person eat a protein rich breakfast, is their hydration affecting absorption, etc"
"It usually because of the inactive ingredients, which differ depending on the manufacturer"
"And what’s crazy is for a pharmaceutical company to make a generic version of a medication, the FDA only requires them to make the drug identical up to 80%"
In my opinion that 20% can change a lot
That is why generics differ sometimes
I personally can’t really feel a difference but some people definitely do notice the difference
Depends on the person.
You can get it specified on the prescription.
"It isn't an issue for everyone, but if it is, and you notice that one particular brand doesn't work for you, tell your pharmacy and / or doctor"
They should be able to arrange for you to not get that brand again.
"I was shocked to see how different something can be, and still be considered a generic substitute for the brand name"
"The fillers as you mentioned are deadly for me, incredibly influential and impactful so that in the case of Ivan, for example I have to use the original brand version of Vyvanse"
"And then I’ve learned that when you do or feel a generic prescription for Vyvanse, you’re not necessarily guaranteed to get the same manufacturer from time to time so even one month to another can be different based on where thepills were manufactured I agree with you completely about strict regulations"
"Yes, everyone is different"
"Different lifestyle, different diet, different metabolism, etc"
So basically we should have to figure out what adjustments we need to make with each different brand of medication
I wish that was possible!
Exactly
The inactive filler ingredients vary which can mess with how the medication is released.
Absolutely
The problem occurs when that specified brand is often out of stock or just completely unavailable at certain pharmacies.
my insurance doesn't cover brand name unfortunately
"Though I've been doing pretty well on the generic IR, whereas the generic XR felt more inconsistent."
You can specify the manufacturer of the generic
IR versus XR is a different matter
Two different systems of delivery
XR intends to keep a steady yet low level over a longer period versus IR is an instant release form.

Maybe I should get medicated because this sounds like a dream
"i have to admit i’ve wondered the same thing! but after years, i’ve come to decide it doesn’t matter.

truthfully, there’s a very real chemical and neurological impact on your brain and body from the medication, but many of us struggle with the idea or concept that maybe we’re making this up."
"or some how using adhd as en excuse for being lazy, a failure, (whatever words you want to insert here)"
" 

Feel free to DM if you want someone to talk to or you have more questions"
The way to know if this is right for you is to talk to a doctor about the challenges you've faced and see where that goes.
That’s not how the medication works
"In fact, the fact that your mind “exploded” and you had an increase of energy - actually points to the possibility that you don’t have adhd"
"The first few months taking adhd meds however, are a bit like a yo-yo; up and down"
"If you have adhd, the meds actually just make your mind fire better, not like you’ve taken pep pills or drank a bunch of coffee"
"

Get diagnosed professionally, don’t take your friends medicine, and then follow a qualified practitioners advice"
It’s the only way to responsibly act on what your situation is
 Please don’t self medicate.
"oh its kinda feeling like a dream for me too, that's why I'm scared of it being just a placebo lmao it's too good to be true"
of course it's not a miracle but a huge part of the weight i feel in my body when I think about doing anything and the fog I constantly feel in my mind is kind of..
gone?
"well, I guess you're right lmao since I'm being able to do things that are normally SO hard for me to do, even if it is a placebo, it's fine ahahah"
"yes, you're totally right! unfortunately I don't have the money to go to a doctor now, and I'm scared of being mocked and looked down by my father again.."
"but I'll try asap, since is something so important to me and that can literally change my life"
thanks ^^
unfortunately I'm not able to get diagnosed now! don't have the money to seek a doctor
"but thanks! what do you mean when you say that the ""mind fire better""? I actually wasn't feeling like I drank a bunch of coffee (to be honest I don't feel anything different when I drink coffee or drink energy drinks, so perhaps I'm feeling what most people feel when they drink caffeine?), but, like, I felt like I could do things, you know? I was able to clean my room, and to study! sometimes I looked at my phone, of course, but I wasn't feeling that intense NEED of doing something else, like, to just lay on my bed and watch tiktoks or to distract myself with anything else but studying"
that's not how the medication is supposed to feel? could you describe how I should be feeling now if I actually had ADHD? thank you so much again ^^
Was your mind clear and able to focus on one task at a time until completion? That’s basically what the meds do for me
My mind acts like the normatives of the world
I’m not as scattered
"yess! like, normally, when I try to clean my room, I start cleaning and get bored, all I can think is that my bed is just there and I could be doomscrooling on a social media"
"but then instead of giving in, I try harder! but then I see that beautiful shirt that I couldn't find anywhere, and, well, I could try it on with some make up to see how I look like, right? and then, 30 mins later, I realize I just swept half of the room"
"then I get the broom again, but, oh, those are my old school notebooks? I should totally read them! and more 20 mins"
"ok, now I WILL finish cleaning my room, right? of course not"
"3 hours later, I'm trying to solve the Rubiks cube I bought when I was 12"
then I give up and doomscrool on a social media
"and then I remember I have a place to go in 30 minutes and I didn't even get a shower.

sorry for the long paragraph, but it's rare for me to be able to vent about my own frustrating actions, them being caused by ADHD or just laziness"
what I mean by that is that this afternoon I just cleaned my room
without any of those things
simply..
cleaned
it felt good
"

I'll try as soon as possible to get a proper diagnosis! having ADHD or not, ita always good to have your mind checked once in a while, I guess"
thank you so much for your comment! ^^
"Yea, that does check out with my experience"
Easily distracted
Quick to doomscroll
Etc
 Just be careful with taking other people’s meds
The dosage is important
"yes, you're right.."
"I guess that my line of thought was that if I see that the meds actually do something for me, I won't be spending I don't know how much in a doctor for something that doesn't work at all"
"it worked (hoping it's not a placebo!), so now I'll be sure to save money to seek a professional"
your comment was really helpful 😄
Good luck
You’ve got this!

"Yeah, when I tried XR, I kind of felt sad"
Strange since I didn’t start out that way
I took notes and ultimately was given the IR
" The doctor said XR can have a tiny bit lower absorption rate, which can make a noticeable difference."
I’m glad I’m not the only one who felt a difference.

you know what?? i didn’t think so… until you asked! there are a number of things that i experience like that.
tequila taste and smell remind me of an old ‘moldy’ house.
"I am so sorry you have to deal with this 🤣🤣
It’s sometimes really off putting"
Parent who has ADHD is very sensitive to smells
I do am not but still have it
"

Others who know more may be able to provide data but anecdotally I’m 1000 percent positive it’s a sensory issue that is related to ADHD / Autism"
"

What I can tell you is that what she is experiencing is REAL"
"

Her brain turns up the volume at that one thing that she can’t ignore it or it would take her monk level mindfulness to not let it show that it’s affecting her"
"

Other ADHD people can pick out sentences being said several feet away that others don’t even notice.

Also, trust her smell: she very well may be right about what she is smelling.

I still remember working retail at a clothing store and the woman in the fitting room had milk breath that somehow filled the whole handicap stall"
"I had never experienced that before and haven’t since.

What I will say is that behaviors need to be regulated: if she’s throwing glass across the wall at a smell she needs a brain scan"
"

If she is simply stating this is not within her window of tolerance and is removing herself, respect that"
"

Be curious, ask her questions, seek out others who aren’t like you"
"

It can be really difficult to understand and make space for these things if you aren’t used to it.


I have had the benefit of being around many different kinds of people both typical and different.

Yes, I am giving you a sermon 🤣🤣

HOWEVER,  I really want to validate that what you’re experiencing and feeling is ABSOLUTELY valid"
"

Work it out, you both are adults"
Love covers a multitude of sins
Sorry if this was too much 💋💋💋
"maybe maybe not,
I attribute my sensory issues more to my autism but who knows"
YES
I am extremely sensitive to smells and I really wish I wasn't
It's worse since I started WFH
My mum loses it when I react to smells
I also HATE CINNAMON with a passion
Scalp sebum
Socks
Breath
Mildew on peoples clothes
"People who don't wash their ass 😭😭😭😭😭😭

I can also smell/sense some bugs"
Don't ask me how
People have witnessed it and can't believe I can do it
I also have impeccable hearing
I will hear the tinest sounds and find them
Lol
Sensory issue
"I am super sensitive to smells, too"
"Also to loud sounds, especially if they're unexpected"
"
As to the smells, in my country, every taxi car has these car fresheners hanging from the mirror, it's sort of customary"
I can't ride a taxi without feeling sick afterwards
"The kind of air freshener aroma doesn't matter, it's the strength"
They're all too strong for me
"I also can't put perfume on my neck, as it's too close to my nose and always makes me sick"
"As to the types of smells, I personally can't stand the smell of certain types of alcohol,  of gasoline and maracuya (it smells like puke to me)"
"Actually, many others, but these are what o can think of right now."
This is so funny
I have ADHD and hate cinnamon to the point the smell makes me nauseous
"Yesterday I was telling a friend this and she told me ""you're the only adult I know that hates cinnamon"" well guess I am not!"
I am sensitive to smells like your girlfriend
I like cinnamon though
"But my mom says it smells like butt crack 😂

When I say I am sensitive to smells.."
I'm always the first one to know when something is burning
"I also can smell some bugs, like some kind of ants"
"I can even smell some medical problems that people have, like uncontrolled diabetes"
"It's a blessing and a curse, I can smell flowers meters away, but also I can smell when my neighbors poop"
"

Sometimes I wish they did odor blocker plugs like we do with sound-suppressing earbuds lol"
I definitely can smell sickness on people
Or in an area if someone sick is in there
"It's very off-putting.

Too much cilantro smell makes me gag."
I have adhd and adore cinnamon but once I went into a pub to get something for my parents and just could not stand the smell and refused to go in
TBH I do also have autism so that might be it
"I am sensitive like your girlfriend to all smell, a good smell, but too strong drive me crazy 😆 Somes friends call me K9 dog, because I can say if they change something"
"I hate cinnamon in particular the taste, you dont want you don’t want to see me eat anything with cinnamon 😅 Cinnamon makes me feel nauseous, gives me a headache, and it makes my nose and sinuses itch"
"Oh yeah my sense of smell is horribly strong, can smell food still in its unopened package it affects lots of things in life, can't change a nappy without almost puking everytime"
"I wasn't diagnosed with ADHD until I was 40, but I've had a horribly oversensitive sense of smell my whole life"
"Certain perfumes, food cooking smells, cleaning products make me gag.."
"I used to work beside a lovely woman who wore a floral perfume that genuinely made me feel ill, and whenever she'd come to my desk for more than a few minutes to chat I'd have to hold my breath or make a concerted effort to breathe through my nose 🤢 I felt awful because she didn't do anything wrong, but it was SO bad"
"It's more closely associated with autism, which is frequently comorbid with ADHD, but it can happen with ADHD as well"
"I also have some very strong smell aversions, though it thankfully rarely impacts my life."
im like cinnamon but i understand the sentiment
"Don't know if it's due to my ADHD, but yes, I have a heightened sense of smell and certain smells can distract me to the point of being unable to function"
"I'm allergic to cinnamon, so while the smell of it doesn't bother me, it can kill me"
"For me, it's stuff like burnt popcorn"
I cannot handle the smell of burnt popcorn.
"Yes!! Not cinnamon in particular, but as a person with ADHD, smells are my biggest nightmare! I can become nauseated so fast at certain smells."
"I have ADHD but, at least as far as I know, do not have autism, and yeah I think I'm sensitive to smells as well"
I can't drink coffee anymore because I can smell something for the rest of the day when I go No
"1, sort of like what asparagus does, that I just can't stand"
"I can generally smell when other women are having their periods (I think what I'm really smelling is scented feminine products), and when something smells bad it's usually overwhelmingly bad to me to the point where I can't ignore it and do my best to get out of there.

I actually weaned myself off my antidepressants because the manufacturer changed the formulation so that the pill supposedly tasted like vanilla, but the smell was so offputting to me that it made me feel nauseous to keep taking them"
"I just kind of started relying on the 'brain zaps' to let me know when I really really had to take it, so then since I was taking it less frequently, I got brain zaps less frequently until I just didn't get them anymore and had no mental obligation to keep taking them (aside from depression flaring back up but apparently that was better than taking the stinky meds to me)."
Senses are more active
She can probably detect your fake friends too
"this doesnt mean much but I have ADHD and hate cinnamon like get that shit away from me, also i hate the smell of oranges on my fingers when i peel them and bell peppers for some reason🤷‍♂️go figure"
I have adhd and HATE cinnamon flavours or smells and anything like pine trees etc
Parmesan-cheese smells like vomit and I am having a hard time understanding why anyone wants to eat it.
Smell averse ADHD person here
I slammed the door in my stepson's face once because he smelled so bad
Didn't even know I did it until after it happened
That day I figured out what certain odors are triggers. 
"Texture, and more recently, sound is my biggest sensitivity, but reading the responses here made me remember my hatred of the smell of hard boiled eggs and anything made from them"
Parm ranks right up there too
"

And a few stores have chased me out the door with the super-strong incense they burn."
"I have ADHD but can't speak to any smell aversions, although 10 years of smoking may have stunted my smell.

However, my wife, who is on the spectrum, has SEVERE smell aversions along with some other sensory intolerance"
"Like, I literally can barely cook anything in the house without setting her off.

I've heard ADHD and spectrum disorders are similar in many ways so it makes sense that the smell aversion can affect both similarly."
I thought it was just me
I have a super strong sense of smell
"Like I can smell when someone is on their period, or a particular person’s perfume from the other side of a building"
I used to hold my breath when I walked through the coffee aisle in grocery stores
"Never thought of it being connected to the ADHD though and I’m not on the spectrum asfaik.

I don’t mind cinnamon though, but hate floral smells and they give me instant headaches."
"There’s sensory overload in ADHD so definitely.

I get overwhelmed by smells, textures, the taste of some things and even visually."
"I have overall heightened senses, smell is a huge one for me."
I suspect some sense are heightened because the brain has trouble filtering out extraneous stimuli
I notice I hear a lot more annoying noises than the average person and probably also have the sensitivity to bad smells.
"No aversions, I don't think"
Maybe some fall smells
"Like, I'm not wild about cinnamon, pumpkin, or super sweet smells"
"It might make me feel a little sickly, but it's not unbearable"
But there are a lot of scents I very much particularly enjoy in my house
They're incredibly comforting to me and I love smelling them
"So I guess I'd say I have opinions about smells, but my strongest opinions are about smells I love and not smells I dislike."
Idk just a neurotic?
"Ahhh tequila, the most common self inflicted assault of my 20s"
">you know what?? i didn’t think so… until you asked! 

Same here! I was like, well, I don't really like the smell of coffee permeating through our house (I don't think it's all coffee, just the kind my husband buys), and apparently I'm always smelling things my husband can't"
"I also get migraines that are triggered by certain smells (certain perfumes and candles, even though I love perfume and candles!), so I always attributed it to that, but maybe it is related to ADHD."
My girlfriend read your reply and she agrees
She said especially the honey flavored ones.
Most perfumes to me remind me of musty old carrots for some reason.
"Yeah i think of this as an autism thing, too"
"Roaches, I would smell them before seeing them mostly, one time, while moving I was like ""there smells like roaches"" and none believed me, then I angrily took something that smelled too much to demonstrate it and while I was like ""look, this is how roaches smells"" I saw it at inches of my face ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|table_flip)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|table_flip)"
What kind of bugs can you smell? I've never been able to do that but I can taste when water has been contaminated by ants
(acrid almost bitter taste)
You’re not the only one because I hate it too
I can only describe it as “offensive”
This time of year is quite hard on my nose!
"Lol, I love the taste but hate de smell, I think I tasted it before smelling it previously in my life because no way it could be the other way around."
So it's like am experience that made you not like the smell?
"It smells like dirty feet to me, and agree with you 100% on not knowing why people want to eat it."
"There’s one type of perfume smell (I don’t think it’s one singular perfume more like a group of perfumes centred around the same component) that seems to be somewhat popular currently, which gives me really bad stomach aches and nausea 🙃"
I'm a nurse with ADHD
"I can smell high blood sugar, cancer, and when people are on blood thinners"
And the smell of insulin is REALLY strong but not offensive
What do roaches smell like? I've heard of that being an odor that people can pick up on if they know what to sniff for
Depends on the color of the ant 🤣
"Ooh, that's rough"
I have a hard time when I work in high schools because of all the body sprays and deodorants
"I mean, don't get me wrong, I prefer them to the alternative of teenage BO, but sometimes it's just really overwhelming"
"Thankfully most workplaces now have policies encouraging people not to wear strong scents, but of course, there's always those couple of people..."
So fascinating
"What do they smell like to you, if you can describe?

I also have a super sensitive sense of smell"
I remember my dad smelled different (not in a good way) right before he was diagnosed with cancer
But it was hard to describe then and even harder now.
My girlfriend had a driver in the office and she despises riding in his car because it smells so bad like phlegm
It turns out the driver was diagnosed with lung cancer
She can smell someone who has appendicites
It's kinda cool
I wonder if there are any clinical trials or ongoing research about this.

The biggest thing for me was to buy dishes/dish ware that I could throw in the dishwasher
I even have purposely bought shitty knives so I don't have to hand wash them
I believe we only have like 2-3 pans that can't be thrown in the dishwasher but every thing else we own can be
"It's been a lifesaver for me.

Another thing (in terms of dishes) is I try to at least run the dishwasher once a day even if it's not entirely full"
"Nothing makes me feel lazier than going to grab a bowl, realize the bowl is dirty in the dishwasher, and then just not eating"
I also have a thing on my dishwasher that I can flip that will tell me if the dishes are clean/dirty
It's been helpful
I have one for my laundry too.
I cut down on the number of dishes I own
Can't have a mountain of dishes if every dish you own can't add up to a mountain! I put the ones in don't need in a box so if I did ever need a replacement for a broken one I can pull it out if I have company over for dinner it's easy enough as well to grab extras.

"Fair warning, the euphoria and “high” you feel when you start stimulants does not last"
"Everything might feel amazing right now, but it may not tomorrow."
Good job! Don't overwork yourself so you avoid burnout!!!
"lol, I just cleaned half of the house bc of the energy I have"
I had to drink a LOT of water while on vyvanse
I didn't drink enough and eventually got sick
"Probably more due to a dry room, mouth-breathing/snoring, and this medication."
i love vyvanse so much!!
"Congrats!!


That must feel quite amazing."
First day for me on Vyvanse as well
Overall feeling quite good
Not as buzzy energized as my short Concerta experience
I have noticed feeling less unreasonable dread over doing random tasks
"Like replacing a failing door knob, computer stuff that I usually hate doing, etc"
I started to feel my energy wane a little about 6 hours after taking it but I had a little coffee and that has kept me going
"

Definitely not as hungry as I normally would be"
I’ll have to keep an eye on that.
So happy it's working for you! I had similar experience by day 2 I was amazed I went a few seconds without chatter in my head and anxiety eliminated I was so happy and realized I hadn't felt joy like that for years
"I took adderall for four days I felt peaceful, then it stopped"
Made me anxious
"i just restarted meds- vyvanse- & it’s def better than nothing…unlike adderral, it feels like the chemical equivalent of anxiety- at least, lots of bruxism, clenching & etc"
i got used to it & it mellowed so that i’m better tuned
"adderral did not have the anxious component, but, ok…"
appetite is def a thing!
"Totally! As others have said, the first few days definitely give you a more escalated experience, and then it levels out as your body adjusts, and as long as the dosage is right, then you’re more at what non-ADHDers feel like"
Which on its own is still a huge difference
"

Before switching to vyvanse, I was on non-stimulants for a couple years, and the one I was taking builds up slowly in your body so if you miss a dose, it’s not as drastic night and day"
Because of that I kind of forgot just how hard existing in life was the first 35 years of my life before getting diagnosed
"Now that I am on a stimulant, if I miss a dose, there isn’t really any residual from before and it’s just a fully unmedicated day and that huge contrast overnight of how my brain feels is enough that I kind of get emotional realizing how hard everything didn’t need to be if I had just been diagnosed as a kid

Edit-before I went off on that last tangent I meant to say, since your next day or so will be a little more superhuman feeling, I recommend doing what I did and take maximum advantage of it"
I just positioned myself in our storage closet that was years overdue for a reorganization and just went to town hahah
"Great, how did you get diagnosed? Online or with a practitioner"
Exactly
I wish psychiatrists mentioned that key detail lol
"You're starting at an energy deficient, so ofc stimulants are going to take you over the moon initially"
It wanes fast as tolerance builds.
So do I! i’d very willingly do Vyvanse commercials if ever given the chance
A practitioner
My therapist referred me to one.

Low doses of medication make me anxious?

Inappetence is a fairly common side effect
"In fact, Vyvanse is also approved for treating binge eating disorder"
"

It should improve over time"
"For now, try to eat a good breakfast before you start to feel the effects of it each morning"
You should also mention it to your doctor.
See I don’t WANT it to end lol
I’m terrified that my binging will come back
Or maybe because my adhd is being treated that will help regardless of whether I have a physical appetite or not? Idk.

> I was wondering if caffeine could be a substitute
"I’m assuming not.

Not really, no"
"Caffeine improves focus, but, unlike ADHD meds, it does so by suppressing your brain's fatige regulation, so you can stay awake more easily and sleepiness doesn't reduce your ability to focus"
"But sleepiness is not the problem with ADHD, motivation/reward hormones are, and caffeine does not act on those"
"Which means caffeine can help you fight against your brain a little longer, but you will lose that fight anyway, so the increased focus will be short lived"
"Also, the kind of caffeine dosages you'll need to get a noticeable effect will likely lead to tolerance buildup, so this is absolutely not sustainable"
"I've been there - before I got diagnosed, I self-medicated with coffee, 12-16 espresso shots per day, and they did next to nothing, but I didn't know any better.

> I used to drink a lot of coffee and I had negative results"
"Now I drink green tea.

The relevant active ingredient in both is caffeine.

> Any natural remedies or ideas to help?

Nope"
"At least not the way you think.

Therapy is useful"
"Anything that improves overall physical well-being will also benefit your mental health - a healthy, varied diet, fresh air, regular exercise, decent sleep hygiene, avoiding/eliminating stress, that kind of thing.

But there are no over-the-counter drugs or herb preparations or supplements or anything like that that have been shown to be effective against ADHD symptoms"

Yeah switching to kids strawberry flavored toothpaste made me way more likely to brush my teeth.
Also! There's NOTHING stopping you from using kid's toothpaste! There's a chocolate flavored one that i am OBSESSED with.
"I will say this over and over, one of the best motivators for ADHD is novelty and variety"
"Why am I so good at taking notes in class? Because I have multiple coloured pens, I like to “reward” myself by finishing a section of notes by choosing a new colour! I like changing colours and making my notes look pretty and visually satisfying"
This toothpaste trick is a great tip btw! Thank you :)
I got an ad the other day for a Grillo’s Pickles toothpaste collab
Will you please try the pickle toothpaste and report back to us?
They need to make the little disposable toothbrushes (like the Wisp) in flavors other than mint
Those little things are amazing; I remember to brush my teeth in the car more often than not but I’m so so so tired of mint.
Another tip: you don’t need to use much toothpaste
I get samples from the dentist and stopped buying any.
This is unfortunately very region-specific (i.e
"mostly in Europe) and not particularly inexpensive, but the Curaprox ""[be you](https://sweetfriends.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Be_you_60ml-1200x1200.jpg)"" line of toothpaste is both good quality and has lots of (non-mint) flavors! A more limited selection of flavors on other continents, last time I checked"
"Their brushes are also a bit smaller and less overwhelming.

Figured the cost was worth it to help my partner, who has a much harder time than I do"
"Also, a lot of toothpastes will give me canker sores, but this one doesn't.

My partner also keeps a bag of floss sticks next to the computer and doubles up on fidgeting + dental hygiene."
"My hacks:
 1) Brush while in the shower"
"I’m cleaning the rest of my body, why not my teeth?
2) Keep a pack of single use toothbrushes and flossers in my car"
I know this isn’t the most sustainable option but I’m hoping they come out with recyclable ones or something because my teeth are not recyclable 😂
I just have thin gums so have to use a toothpaste that is protectorant of them
"Was prescribed one that made my mucous membranes shed once, that was fun"
"Brushing is hard, but gotta do it cos I like my teeth"
Sonic toothbrush was the gamechanger for me.
I hate the taste of most toothpaste brands
I loved Mentadent baking soda and peroxide one in the pump but it’s been discontinued
So I’m worried when it eventually runs out.
WTF? You can?! That’s kind of weird.
"great tip and observation!! it’s hard to know if something’s ’just you’ until you hear, see differently"
I'd spend an hour deciding what toothpaste to use every day lol.
Speaking of toothpaste… I CAN NEVER REMEMBER WHICH ONE I LIKE
 I get to the store and my mind blanks
 Every single time.

You also can ask for a fun flavor at the dentist when they polish your teeth - I go for bubble gum or chocolate!
I switched to Dessert Essences Tree tea toothpaste when I went vegan
It's a whole new ballgame
"It doesn't burn my mouth, and the flavor is less harsh and doesn't hang around messing with my breakfast"
"

I think for me, it was a sensory thing because I just don't really have issues brushing my teeth anymore."
"I take this on board but...unless the Oral B factory is wiped off the face of the Earth, I'm using that delicious gritty bastard until the day I die."
"Ι pace my hallway as I brush, I've been brushing my teeth at least once a day for years since I started that."
Brilliant!
"YES i finally caved after seeing so many HiSmile ads and got a couple flavors, and it makes brushing my teeth so much easier and it feels a little less like a chore"
i got a cherry one and a wonka chocolate one (i know chocolate toothpaste like wtf but its actually fucking delicious) and ill use one pump of each
"also, i never realized that part of me not wanting to brush my teeth was just the idea of bacteria building on my brush"
"it was just a subconscious thing, but i bought a toothbrush cover and it makes the anxiety of brushing a little lighter"
"I remember having this realisation last year and buying the strawberry toothpaste I had as a kid, great for when I want to freshen up a bit but don’t want the full on assault of mint"
Thanks for the reminder!
This post just made me smile.
"Yeh variety is good, I have neem leaf toothpaste ATM"
euthymol toothpaste is laying around (strong scent) good sometimes
"Eucrul tooth powder (strong and used for whitening teeth, don\`t recomend as daily).

Also bough hemp toothpaste"
"Used charcoal powder (it is a bit messy).

Miswak sticks are interresting."
My friend enjoys buying toothpaste from every place he travels including layovers! I got to try some that felt like tiger balm from Thailand and green tea from Japan
"It’s true, the novelty is fun."
This was also a revelation to me a year or so ago
I have like 4 or 5 toothpastes now
Orange?! Where do you find orange? I've been looking for a good citrus paste since Crest eliminated their Whitening Expressions line
"Toothpaste has flavours? It’s not just mint ?

(I’m in australia)"
"If you haven’t tried the euthymol one, please do - it’s elite."
I would really appreciate it if there was a brand that made a variety of flavored toothpastes for adults
"I’m not a huge fan of minty toothpaste but my dentist and hygienist insist I use a certain mouthwash that only comes in mints (I was using a kids bubble gum flavored one before that I loved, but this mint one really helps I guess), and due to sensitivity I have to use Sensodyne"
If anybody knows of a brand that does other flavors of something similar that works please tell me! 🙏🏻
I brush my teeth without toothpaste…
This advice is amazing!
What in the insomnia post is this
"I really liked the charcoal paste i got, not because its charcoal or has any brightening effect or any of that hype garbage, i just like the particular mint flavour it has which tastes nothing like any of the other bazillion kinds of mint form the same brand."
Ohhhhh look at money bags here with their being able to afford multiple toothpastes at once
You think you’re better than me?!
"Jesus man, you need to slow down."
I don’t think I needed someone to try dog toothpaste for me to know it would be gross
But I appreciate you taking one for the team and reaffirming my expectations from dog bacon toothpaste
A toothpaste collection being referred to as an arsenal has me cackling
My dog has liver flavoured toothpaste
I won't be joining you on this voyage of discovery
She loves it though.
Love it! Why speculate when you can empirically test it!
"To be fair, my dog's pepperoni flavored treats always smelled so good"
"Finally, one day, I tried one, and it was not what it smelled like at all.

So gross."
"Maybe that's why our dog didn't like the bacon flavoured bubbles (as in, the type you make with soap water"
But edible.)
"I'll take it to a party and ask the guys willing to try it next summer, if it tastes awful."
"Additionally! If you're a person who takes birth control (I believe pills specifically, not sure about other kinds) activated charcoal can cancel out the effects of the pills!"
I second this
I have holes in the enamel of some of my teeth due to using charcoal toothpaste for a year
Immediately stopped using it once I noticed the holes.
But then so does most of the whitening toothpaste?
"I use charcoal sometimes because it does a significantly better job at neutralizing odors than any of the less abrasive alternatives they compare to.

At the core, toothpaste is just abrasive particles in a suspension.

I'm actually a little surprised at their results given that tooth enamel has a Mohs hardness of roughly 5 and dentin is usually 3-4, but charcoal is only about 2.5.

Comparitively that's about the same as baking soda and significantly lower than most other common dental abrasives like silica (which is 5-6 and what you'd find in Crest).

Coming from a perspective of experience in woodworking and having done a lot of sanding, not controlling for particle size as a variable in studies seems like a big miss"
" I'd wager that had far more of an effect on the variances they observed than the abrasive material itself.

Given that almost no one advertises the grit size of abrasives in their toothpaste and the formulations you get can vary wildly between manufacturers, you're taking a huge gamble that avoiding charcoal is going to guarantee you get something that's less abrasive.

Even then, the conclusion that more ""abrasive potential"" is bad also glosses over big differences that are likely to be observed in the real world vs"
"the in vitro testing that the studies it looks at were based on.

In actual use, two things happen naturally when people use a more abrasive compound on a surface (regardless of whether the activity is brushing teeth, deburring the end of a pipe, or prepping a piece of furniture for finishing):

1"
"They apply less pressure to remove the same amount of material.

2"
"They stop sooner because it takes less time to remove the same amount of material.

If you try to compare abrasives by simulating an activity with a machine that applies the exact same amount of pressure for the exact same amount of time, it's a forgone conclusion that you're going to damage the surface more if you use a more abrasive compound.

A more accurate test to assess the impact of different abrasives would require toothbrushes with sensors to measure differences in how hard and how long people apply pressure."
Mine is to have a toothbrush and toothpaste in the shower AND by my sink at night.
"3 Sonicares! Though I think I need one on my nightstand, too, because it's often too challenging to grab it from the bathroom."
"We do that too, making sure to have dedicated spots out on the counter for everything including open bins of individual use flossers."
I keep a cup in every bathroom so whenever i pee I remember to hydrate lol
I have the vanilla flavored one
I did have a sample pack from them as well...that way you can find the one (or ones) you like best
"They do have mint too, but why would you want something that you can get anywhere?"
"Hismile is amazing! I used to struggle with teeth brushing mainly due to Autism I think, and now I have a collection of Hismile that I use alternately (in alphabetical order) and haven't missed brushing my teeth once since I started using it"
" 
I just find mint too much, and only ever used to use one specific brand of toothpaste because that was the only one I liked the flavour of before I tried Hismile."
I love hismile! Before they existed I was using kids strawberry flavoured toothpaste cos I can't deal with mint (too aggressive)
Now I have about 12 different hismile flavours which makes brushing my teeth far more bearable
For anyone in aus they’re on sale now at coles/woolies for 50% off
"a LOT of Hismile flavors have mint, so make sure to check the ingredients for stealth menthol"
"I bought Hismile Peach Iced Tea flavor and was extremely displeased because it's now the mintiest toothpaste I own.

if you want something safely mint-free, hello toothpaste is excellent, although I think they discontinued grape which is bullshit."
"Careful though, kid’s toothpaste has less fluoride than adult toothpaste and the Theodent one is fluoride free."
Ooh what brand is it?
"Just in case you (or anyone reading this) don’t know, if toothpastes gives you canker sores it’s usually caused by sodium laurel sulfate"
Using toothpaste without this can help!
Another one that was interesting was the (now discontinued) Trader Joe's fluoride free
" It included fennel and myrrh, which are a little outside the normal flavor profile for ""mint"".

I still have a few tubes left and it'll be disappointing when I eventually run out.

I did get some miswak sticks, but then I forgot where I put them and keep forgetting to order more."
"The two I have at the moment:

Kiss My Face Sensitive Citrus Mint - this is orangey but still has a hint of mint

Boka Orange Cream with nano-hydroxyapatite - this is basically a creamsicle flavor"
Hi Smile does lots of different flavours in pretty cute packaging too
It’s a bit pricey but maybe on when on sale.
"hello toothpaste has a bunch with fluoride and no mint whatsoever.

Hismile has a fuckload of flavors, but a lot of them have menthol as an ingredient even when you wouldn't expect it (like the Peach Iced Tea flavor is super minty), so make sure to check."
FYI charcoal toothpaste is terrible for your teeth and will wear down your enamel
I honestly don’t know why they even sell it
"Charcoal damages your teeth, and is not FDA approved"
No idea how it's even legal.
Science!
I tried one of my friend’s dog’s kibble bc it was vegan and I was curious
"Very salty, but otherwise not very remarkable"
I don’t think I’d dare try the regular ones 😅
"Dude if you took the contents of that bottle and poured it into a bottle with normal bubble branding on it, and then gave it to your niece/nephew as a gift, you would be the funniest Aunt/Uncle in the world"
Activated charcoal interferes with a lot of medications
That's one of its uses: treating overdoses and poisonings.
it can cancel out a lot of meds unfortunately! including antidepressants and i think adhd meds too
"**Ohh...**

**this makes sense...**"
"As is they say, it's the dose that makes the poison.

Doing the math and looking at reference points to compare:

* **700,000mg** of charcoal is what it would take to kill an average adult male
   * That's based on 10,000 mg / kg being the LD50 for charcoal in rats
* **50,000-100,000mg** of charcoal is what's used as an emergency treatment for poisoning
   * Doses for treatment are roughly 1,000mg / kg
* **500-1000mg** is what people sometimes take as a supplement
* **10-50mg** is about how much would be in the toothpaste that you dispense
   * That's based on average adults using 100-250mg of toothpaste and an estimate of \~10-20% of the contents of a charcoal toothpaste being charcoal
* **\~1-8mg is what you're likely to ingest if you spit out the toothpaste afterwards**
   * Estimates I saw were that you wind up swallowing \~10-15%
   * (If you rinse after brushing, that would decrease exposure even more)
* **\~1mg is what you'd consume eating a hot dog or hamburger cooked on a charcoal grill**

I'm highly skeptical that charcoal toothpaste under normal use would have a noticeable effect on medications.

  
I was curious how much was given in any of the studies that looked at effects on birth control and found this one from 2001:

[https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article-abstract/16/1/76/3113914?redirectedFrom=fulltext](https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article-abstract/16/1/76/3113914?redirectedFrom=fulltext)

In the study:

* Patients were being given a total of 20,000mg per day (spread via 4 doses)
* Even at that dose, none of them ovulated
* The conclusion was that charcoal was probably OK to give as a treatment for side-effects of contraceptives

In terms of practical application, it seems to be more ""avoid sex for a few days if you're treated for poisoning"" than ""incidental exposure to charcoal could get you pregnant"".

Super important for an ER doctor to know about so they can warn their patients in specific situations, but maybe not so much of a big deal for anyone else."
Used activated charcoal for a while in my sophomore year of high school
Stopped because my teeth got REALLY sensitive
"Ice cream has never been the same since, I’m 22 now."
Yes
But your dentist might have other solutions for whitening like bleaching or at the very least can do something in a controlled proffessional setting
He will probably know what is ok and what is terrible and act accordingly.
"I'm not disagreeing with you on the broad subject, as you are correct in a lot of things"
"

However both 1"
and 2
seem to be far from any reality I live in
"

Do you brush your teeth by looks or do you brush them a certain amount of time? If not, than 2"
is not going to happen
"

And I have never changed the pressure I apply between two different toothpastes"
So that means that 1
is never ever happening
"I don't use a lot of different ones though, so I don't know"
"You use different ones, do you use different pressures between different pastes ?

For woodworking or metalwork I kinda agree, though I keep the pressure mostly the same and only change the time of application"
"It depends on the stage of finnish I am in aswell with the last step beeing polishing where you use a very fine abrasiv with a cloth in a lot of cases.

I do have an electric toothbrush that kinda does have pressure sensors"
When I press to hard it just stops doing it's thing till I ease of the pressure
How much more indepth it does stuff I don't know.
"I like the idea of brushing/shaving in the shower, but I'm way too blind to manage that"
I’ve been doing it for years
It’s great.
"Same with me!

I picked up a tube in Australia and fell in love"
(Barbie/bubble gum flavor)
I immediately ordered 6 more tubes the minute I got home
"(I’m in the US.)

Turns out, they’re an Aussie company! I should’ve picked up more while I was there, but at least I can get it shipped here! (I’m in Alaska"
Shopping selections are minimal.)
"I was, too! But kid’s toothpaste often lack fluoride which is super important"
"I was so happy to find Hismile, (I found it while I was traveling aus)"
"I did discover mint in the gummy bear, so thanks for the heads up"
It’s definitely not my favorite but not as bad as mint-mint toothpaste.
"Yeah, you want to pair it with something else that has flouride"
Like a mouthwash.
Theodent! You can find it on Amazon
"Just search ""Theodent chocolate""."
"Definitely looking into these, thanks!!"
"well thats not good, i didnt know that, im feeling better about not having seen another tube for sale since and im about to run out!  Crap, the search for nice mint goes on! thanks."
"You never wanted me did you, Ma?"
"Toms of Maine Rapid Relief Sensitive toothpaste is very effective, like nothing else I've tried"
Keep it in contact for two minutes and you won't believe how much better your teeth feel
They say it becomes permanent with long term use
"

I alternate with a fluoride toothpaste."
"I generally stop once my teeth feel like they're gotten to a consistent level of smoothness I associate with them feeling ""clean"" and I can't feel anything stuck to them.

Just like I wouldn't set a fixed time for ""sanding a board"" and assume it applies to all boards, I don't stick to any sort of a fixed time for brushing"
"(Then again, on both counts that could also be a side-effect of ADHD time-blindness)

Qualitatively, I haven't noticed a huge difference in the level of abrasiveness of the toothpaste I've tried with charcoal vs"
"what I'd consider ""average"""
" Where I have found more of a difference has been in a few gel toothpastes -- with the thinner / less abrasive medium, I do find myself needing to brush a little harder to get my teeth as clean.

Even then, in woodworking terms, it's more like the slight amount of difference you might notice from hand sanding with 300grit vs"
240grit than comparing 40 grit on a belt sander vs
120 grit on a random orbital sander
" Enough that you can probably tell if you do back to back comparisons and are paying close attention, but not enough where it's going to feel like you're using completely different technique."
Pretty sure you won't miss your teeth
"😉 I've been shaving for years with an Ikea mirror I tacked up, and I'm super blind without readers"
Helps that I have a beard so there's a lot of leeway on what the finished product looks like
"That, and I shave by feel and not by visuals."
I moved my shaver to the garage for that reason - if I cut my hair or shave my face outside no one cares if I can't see enough without my glasses to pick up all the hair.
My biggest problem now is wanting to collect all the flavours
" 
I have 10 at the moment, and that is enough toothpaste for any sane person"
"I will get more when some runs out, and not before"
Hahaha.
![gif](giphy|3ohhwF34cGDoFFhRfy|downsized)
"Omg, yes! I have 4 open tubes (one for my gym bag, one for my travel bag, 2 for home), and I’m not allowed to open anymore until I use at least one to completion.

Very smart move on their company"
"Make it so good that people need 4-10 tubes instead of just one tube of Colgate, lol."
"Haha!  
  
Definitely a smart move from them, but at this point, they deserve my money"
Lol.

"For me, I’ve learned that if I lose interest in a hobby, pushing through it rarely works unless there’s some external motivation to keep me going"
"Otherwise, it just leads to guilt and procrastination and avoidance.

The downside is that mastery usually requires pushing through discomfort and staying focused on long-term goals"
"If that’s your aim but you’re not willing to persevere through the lulls, it’s easy to set yourself up for disappointment"
"Which is amplified if you aren’t limiting yourself to just a few things (which requires discipline and isn’t easy when you’re chasing shiny objects)

Passion fades when novelty or meaningful progress dry up"
"To stick with something, you either need to truly enjoy the activity itself, develop the discipline to push through the lows, or create structure to keep you on track.

For consistency, emotional regulation makes a huge difference and unfortunately much more challenging for those with ADHD"
"Things like medication, meditation, good sleep, diet, exercise, and hydration help lower stress and make it easier to stick with hobbies"
But starting and staying consistent with those habits can be just as hard (often harder) when motivation dips (or wasn’t there to begin with)
"

I always am trying to look for structure or systems and tricking myself into enjoying them"
"But inevitably they break down and stop working at some point.

e.g"
bullet journaling and creating structure around that was a system that helped other things build off of it
"The real change came when the “aha” moment happened and it turned into a hobby (which lead to a collection of fountain pens and other stationary) was probably one of the most helpful things to consistently maintain other things / hobbies / goals, particularly when they became less interesting or were always a chore"
"Once doing the BUJO became less interesting and I lost the routine due to other life events, it fell apart.

Ultimately, it’s about accepting where you’re at and focusing on enjoying the process rather than chasing constant gratification and things outside your control"
I don’t think there’s a silver bullet.

My ex partner did not believe in ADHD
There were things she did unconsciously (because of her personality) which were comforting
"(Other things were super annoying and made me realise we weren't compatible.)

\- There were these periods where I was super motivated to see her, do things with her, fill her needs, work on the relationship and make her happy"
Followed by periods where I wanted to be alone - hyperfixating on a new hobby that completely occupied my life
She got frustrated although I communicated that these periods will occur
She was understanding but i could feel she was frustrated (which frustrated me) and was annoyed that she was not my priority
She thought I wouldnt care or neglect the relationship
"  
That was NOT true, i was just not invested permanently due to my anxiety, avoiding personality and lack of motivation"
"I loved her very much, it is just hard to show it all the time"
"She probably thinks I took her for granted through these actions.

\- I liked how she let me talk when I wanted to talk"
I am an introvert but as soon as we were alone and wanted to talk about stuff she just listened and tried to be interested
That felt reliefing and was super important
"

\- She helped me organizing my calendar and appointments and our dates"
We had a co-calendar
I still missed dates tho that annoyed her and she blamed me for being forgetful + even said I wouldnt care or love her enough
"

\- I always wished my ex would surprise me with something like: hey i researched this about ADHD, this about mental health or that because it bothered me"
Many things were bothering me but instead of aknowledging me hyperfixating on these things it felt like she could not deal with my curiosity/anxiety
"

\- At the end of our relationship she was frustrated that I am so conflicting"
I wanted to do things but did not do them
I said I would do a thing but did not do it in the end
I told stories differently throughout our time together - she had a great memory
Mine is shit
She blamed me for it
I wished she would've understood that I suffer from this shit and not purposely lying or manipulating her.
The last paragraph is me to a dot
It makes me feel like shit in the relationship but at the same time that's who I am.

Do these learning difficulties relate to ADHD?

"DBT Skills, Meds, prayer, or listening to someone’s problems that I care about"
Meds the most immediately helpful
"Prayer can train your brain to be contemplative so it’s productive it’s always gonna work, DBT is really helpful for anyone just look it up for anyone’s whose interested and people I care usually suck me out of my universe into theirs which is a great way to be weirdly grounded but oriented outward at the same time."
"For me, it starts with music"
"Then I pause and ask myself why this this intrusive thought is coming in.

If i find myself feeling anxious, I pause and then find my calming activity"
"Which is coloring or gaming.

If I still can't shake it I will vent"
Only personal discord I have a vent into the void channel
My friends can see it
They also use it
They know if I need to talk I'll reach out
But there are just days I need to scream out my thoughts.
I learned biofeedback years ago and use it to this day.
Sounds
It's hard to quiet my mind but rain especially helps to focus on.
Exhaustion
I don't necessarily notice when I'm doing it until after.
"Mindfulness meditation, breath work, yoga, painting miniatures, talking to my therapist"
Read “The Power of Now” it will change your life
Definitely music
I’m trying to figure this out as well
I have a very unhealthy relationship with excessive sleep when I’m at home & I feel that way
"But if I’m at work or in a social setting, it’s almost like it intensifies by 100 & I can’t get a grip on it"
Some days I love music
"Some days I want 100% silence, but I do work in a loud factory so that’s a big trigger for me"
"Trying to find hobbies is great, I’ve had little to no luck"
"Hanging with my best friend helps so much, but that’s a 2-3 time per month occurrence"
I think you’ve just gotta get to where to figure yourself out & follow what makes you feel better.
"I pause and ask myself a few questions:
- “am I helping myself or hurting myself right now?”
- “why am I so bothered?”
- “what is the reality?”
- “is any of this in my control, or is it out of my control?”

Etc, etc."
that’s a great question that I certainly don’t have the answer to
I think overthinking is one of the things I do best
"I think part of it is just enjoying the thought process and looking at all the details, and it helps avoid the reality of having dealing with something."
"I had a shrink once tech me that, it was years and years ago but he only got to see me once (the VA hospital system sometimes causes issues with continuity of care) so I never really really learned it"

I was in a similar situation
"My whole path is a long story, but basically I dropped out of college, worked in the food industry for four years, then went back and suddenly had to relearn how to be a college student"
"I am **terrible** at studying, and always felt like I just couldn't keep up.

But I managed to get a bachelors degree in physics (way different from my original major), then got a masters in physics right after"
Everything was so outrageously hard
It still doesn't feel real to me that I did all of that
"I don't know what your strategies were the last time you were in school, but here are some suggestions based on what helped me survive:

* Write down information over and over again 

Write up a study guide of the information you need to remember, like diagrams/definitions/concepts (in as few words as possible!)"
Find a whiteboard or something and write everything on your study guide (or however much you can fit at once) word-for-word
Then erase the board and write it all again
"Keep repeating this over and over again until you can write it all without looking at your study guide.

* Try explaining things to other people

Teaching really is one of the best ways to reinforce your own understanding"
"If you practice explaining some of the course material to other people, whether it's a classmate or a friend who's in an entirely different program, you'll become much more comfortable with the topic.

* Set a timer when working on assignments

So if you're anything like me, then you'll spend *hours* hyperfocusing on a single assignment or study topic that you're struggling with"
For me it would get so bad that I suddenly had no time to work on any of the easier stuff
"Set a timer for like an hour; if you've barely made any progress by the time it goes off, then it's time to set it aside and move on to something else"
"When you go back to it later it might make more sense, or if needed you can ask someone for help before spending more time on it.

* Find people to study with

Studying with others will keep you grounded so you don't get lost in your own mental rabbit holes and academic despair"
"You can bounce things off of each other as you try to understand the material, and those who are more comfortable with certain topics can help explain them to others.

* Go to office hours

Go to office hours often, and if you really need one-on-one help with something then email the professor and ask if they have some time to meet"
"If you feel comfortable doing so, try to explain your personal difficulties when it comes to studying, and ask if they have any tips"
"They might be able to give you an answer that's tailored to the type of material they're teaching.

* Make regular appointments with a counselor

Most universities have some kind of on-campus mental health services"
"Talking to someone about how stressed and overwhelmed you are will help keep you from spiraling too hard.

Okay this was longer than I meant it to be lol but hopefully something in there is helpful."
Jump back in
You will be fine
"If you’re that concerned about learning and remembering anatomy, I’m certain that there’s someone on YouTube or other socials who is teaching it in a way you’ll understand."
"Oh wow, this is *amazing* information"
"Seriously, thank you for writing this, I’m going to look into what support the uni can offer"
"

Thank you so much!"
This is good stuff
"Thanks, it’s nerve racking having to learn again"
Just got sick of tired of the rat race and nerves kicking up a fuss
:)
It seems to me like a good career path for someone with ADHD
You can do hard things
Go for it.

I've been on Cymbalta 60mg twice a day for depression since 2005
 I was on brand name Concerta 54mg every morning for my ADHD until six months ago when I changed to generic Focalin 30mg every morning
 The combination works great.

concerta causing depression?

"When I was on concerta (first med I took for like 2 weeks), I didn’t get depressed, but I got A LOT more anxious and I could feel it in my body, it was horrible"
Concerta is definitely not for everybody and few people actuallt stay on it
"My psychiatrist said something about it possibly being from a too low dose, but I got upped and my anxiety got worse"
"After that he put me on elvanse (vyvanse), and it came without any of the previous issues"
"I haven’t taken it in a while due to other health issues that I’ve dealt with, but I may in the future.

I would recommend talking to your doctor about switching meds if possible ! :)"

I know sometimes a non-stimulant like Guanfacine is added to combat anxiety/aggitation etc caused by stimulants

I would bring this up to your doctor immediately
"Losing time is very abnormal and what you're describing seems way beyond the typical ""stimulants calm the ADHD brain"" explanation"
" This is also a contradictory reaction to what you'd expect with a Wellbutrin/Adderall combo

Wellbutrin actually inhibits the enzyme that breaks down Adderall, so it increases the level of amphetamine in your blood"
"I take both, and the Wellbutrin makes the Adderall more stimulating than it would be if I took it alone."
I don’t take mine at the same time
That might help
I take my first dose of adderall at 8 am
"(10mg IR) , Wellbutrin 300 around 10am"
Second dose of adderall of 5 mg IR at 1pm
EDIT: I’m not a doctor- this is just what works for me*****
Adderall did that to me without Wellbutrin and with Wellbutrin.
"Yes, She warned me about possible jitteriness, anxiety and high blood pressure with the interaction"
"I wrote her on my portal and she writes back that she thinks I need to ""get used to the medication"" and having a more ""slow mind"" and told me we can adjust at the next appointment"
I don't think she knows much about it so that's why I came here lol
Thanks! I will try that
Are you taking Wellbutrin SR or XL?
Did you switch to Ritalin? Or did all the stimulants have a paradoxical reaction for you?
XL
I also drink coffee right when I wake up but only half a cup and never within an an hour of the adderall as I’ve been reading on the sub it can dull its effects
I also have a high protein breakfast right before the adderall dosage
"Greek yogurt, eggs, peanut butter, protein shake etc"
made a big difference
But talk to your doctor for sure! I also told my doctor these things and he said to stick to not taking Wellbutrin at the Same time.
"I tried Ritalin, but yes - I have that reaction to all the stimulants"
"I only take Wellbutrin.

Edit: but don’t be discouraged - we all have different chemistry! You really may find one that works for you."
Thanks
I take the ER Adderall about an hour before I get up so it doesn't kick in for about 2 hours for me and makes me tired till it wears off about 10-12 hrs later
"So not sure taking the wellbutrin SR 2 hrs behind it will work as well as Adderall IR might, but I will give it a try"
Coffee is barely saving my ass right now with the tiredness lol.
"Thanks for the response, I sure hope so!!"
Good luck with your adhd journey

"Age and country?  If American, what state?"
"Who made the diagnosis? If your meds are impacting you that way, they’re not right and you probably shouldn’t be taking them.

I’m on Adderall and it helps me feel calm and have enough capacity to regulate my emotions"
"It doesn’t blunt anything for me, but stimulants absolutely can make anxiety worse and IF you actually have ADHD you either probably shouldn’t be on a stimulant or you need to be on a stimulant AND anxiety medication."
Perhaps you need to be on an antidepressant
 ADHD and depression go hand-in-hand.
"A counselor/therapist would NOT be the one to prescribe this, but often a psychiatrist (who is usually the prescriber of adhd meds) will use the counselor’s notes to monitor your condition"
A psychiatrist also does not always meet with the patient if the patient is a minor
"Seeing your comment where you said you are under 16, you are likely at an age where a psychiatrist will go off of your therapy notes and parent’s words.

These symptoms of yours sound very very abnormal and concerning"
Talking to your mom isn’t something you should be afraid of
Right now it sounds like this medication is hurting you
It is very worth your mother’s time to sort this out
"If you are able to talk to her and tell her all of this, that would be great because then she could advocate for you to the prescriber"
"If there is something besides anxiety that might be making you afraid to talk with her about it/it’s not safe and you don’t feel like it is possible to attend a medication management appointment with her and address everything going, you can contact that prescriber directly by searching up the name on the prescription bottle on the internet"
"

When searching the name up, associated practices with your prescriber should come up"
"If they don’t, you can try including your state, then state and county/city"
"You can email the prescriber or their practice (be sure to include prescriber’s name if it’s the practice) with your name, mom’s name, and what you wrote in this post"
And anything more that explains what’s going on
"If you feel like you don’t have ADHD, I would include that as well"
"If you haven’t met with this doctor it may even be more beneficial for you to search up the diagnostic criteria (DSM-5), and see how much that correlates to you because that is what the psychiatrist would be going off of to determine whether or not you have ADHD"
If you feel like your symptoms are caused by your anxiety that would be important to mention so they can explore that
"Remember, the doctor is there to help and if their source of information is your mother then their treatment may be based off of information that might not be the full story"
"They only know what they are told.

It sounds like it’s possible you could be on way too high dose of a stimulant, or that you don’t need one"
Or that you may need another med in combination with your current medication
"A message to your prescriber will help them get to know the situation better, as right now from your post it sounds like they are going off solely on what your mom says"
"

I don’t know your personal situation and don’t want to make assumptions, but to me it’s a bit concerning that you aren’t included in the care that much and that the prescriber isn’t talking to you"
"I’m not sure if it’s due to a personal situation, a poor psychiatrist, or your mom"
But just know if there is ever anything too scary or concerning there are resources for help
"If you aren’t sure what to do and need better guidance, maybe reaching out to a social worker at your school might be beneficial"
"

I wish you good luck in what ever you decide to do ❤️"
"I’m not comfortable telling my age, but I’m below 16"
"The problem is, I don’t know who made it! I don’t think my councilor did, though"
She is smarter than handing me some random medication without talking to me about it.
"I think I may talk switching again, I have done my research and apparently a lot of people dislike concerta the most out of all medications"
"I dislike it too, I may go back to adderol for the time being, because no matter how bad it was, this is wayy worse"
Understand
" Depending on your country and state, you may be able to make your own, confidential, appointment with your doctor to discuss your conditions and medications"
"

You should not be treated for these conditions without being seen directly by the doctor"
"

In some states, you can make your own confidential appt as low as 12 years old"
" In other states, unfortunately, it's 18"
 Other countries would require research
"

If you decide to call your doctor on your own, I suggest using a Google voice number, with your cell service turned off, with wifi only"
  This will prevent the call from showing on your parents bill
" Or, use a friend's phone"
" Before you say anything, confirm with the doctor if they can continue with a confidential appt given your age and location"
"

I hope you can get this resolved."
Name of the doctor who prescribed the medication should be printed on the prescription bottle.
"Either way, I stress the importance of letting your doctor and mother know all of the details of what is going on"
"They may agree that switching back be a good idea, but it is very important they know all the details"
These symptoms are very concerning and abnormal
"

If the other medication was bad too and not beneficial to you at all, it sounds like in reality it is hurting you"
The point of medication is to help you
"Now, negative side effects are normal, but they shouldn’t be so severe that they outweigh the benefit."

"YES!! Thought I was literally broken.

One thing that has always worked well for me is getting cold, taking a cold shower or sitting outside when it’s cold, especially snowing and at night (this is why I love winter time) and running, running when it’s cold is even better but simply going for a run until whatever pent up emotion comes spilling out.

And I know it is repetitive and annoying to hear, but trust the breathing, it really does help, just don’t do it by itself, do deep breathing while taking a cold plunge or deep breathing while listening to comfort calm music, deep breathing while playing a game, and get obnoxious with it, make sure you can really hear your lungs fill up and release air, reminding your nervous system “yo, see this, we breathing, it’s all good”"
1000% yes I feel like such a fraud as i work in mental health and teach a lot of these techniques to other people when they don't work for me
I feel like a lot of them rely on being able to distract yourself or shift your focus which i never could before medication.
"I learned some EMDR techniques that are for helping out people that have suffered from post-traumatic effects, and they actually work pretty well"
"If you've ever had trauma in your life, they're really nifty"
It's almost like brain hacking
Emdria.org to locate a therapist trained in the technique.
"Oh, I feel this"
"TW: self-harm

Starting in high school, I used to self-injure as a means to calm my anxiety and overwhelm"
 I've got a road map of fading scars on my body that are permanent reminders of temporary feelings
I do not recommend this strategy
"

I've had to work on healthier techniques over the years, and the support I've received from my care team has been excellent"
"I've expressed that I need a level of intensity or discomfort to help get me back to my emotional baseline, but I also understand and appreciate that causing permanent damage to my person is not healthy.

 So, I asked, ""What advice do you have for someone like me who knows and can leverage a really effective method, but has promised not to leverage said method, and all other methods (like those you mentioned) fall extremely short in terms of addressing my anxiety or doing anything to actually help me feel better so I can function"
"

Enter DBT (dialectical behavioral therapy), specifically the TIPP acronym"
" 

I feel like DBT is more helpful than CBT techniques in moments of ADHD overwhelm because, while I am generally an intelligent and rational person, I am NOT in those moments"
CBT feels impossible because I'm not (yet) able to purposefully regain control of my mind without external intervention
"I can only practice CBT techniques when I'm not in a crisis, but DBT skills are great when my lizard brain is full of bees and I can't think about anything beyond my anxiety or overwhelm.

Anyway, here's TIPP:

# Temperature
- Decrease your body temperature to help cool down and lower your heart rate"
"
- You can try splashing your face with cold water, taking a cool shower, or holding an ice cube"
"
- Hot showers can be helpful, too - the trick is a rapid and noticeable change to the temperature you were at when feeling overwhelmed"
"

# Intense exercise
- Physical activity can help release pent-up energy and decrease stress levels"
"- You can try sprinting, jumping jacks, or dancing"
" I prefer dancing to music I know gets my blood pumping.

# Paced breathing
- Practice paced breathing techniques (I do a modified box breathing technique - inhale 4 counts, hold 6 counts, exhale 8 counts, hold 2 counts / inhale 4 counts, etc.)"
"
- I find deep breaths on their own don't help, I need the breath holding and slow exhale to activate the parasympathetic nervous system"
"Needing to focus on counting and connecting to my body helps give me something else to fixate on (even just briefly).

# Progressive muscle relaxation
- Squeeze a muscle group, hold your breath for seven seconds, exhale, and release"
"

**Sometimes, I combine them all at once - I've clenched ice cubes in my fists while holding my breath and dancing under a stream of hot water (carefully).**"
"100%!!!! I relate to this on a different level

usually makes the nervousness I’m feeling turn into anger and frustration if someone suggests the typical “calming” methods bc of how useless I’ve found them to be"
"First, let me say, I'm speaking from my own experience as a 50/m"
"This is what I went through, hope it is helpful to someone else"
"Now, I do wonder if and how this at all ties in with the frequent lament I have said and I still hear from my fellow ADHD people, ""If I'm not immediately good at it, I lose interest"""
"

Many anxiety relieving practices, (deep breathing, meditation, grounding, taking a walk, etc...) are things that require practice and/or a certain mindset"
It may take time to develop those habits and to learn how to get into that headspace
"But we have ADHD and we need it NOW! We try it, it doesn't work the first two or three times, we discard it.

Having a partner to engage in those anxiety reducing rituals can help"
Body doubling and all that
"Granted, they may not be there when you are actually feeling anxiety, but that's why you practiced"
So you CAN do it on your own when it's necessary
"

  
Time and experience is what helped me"
 But hopefully you don't have to wait so long
"We are capable of learning, We are capable of change"
"Maybe we will never be like everyone else, but that doesn't mean we can't better ourselves in ways that work for us."
I was only recently diagnosed
"About 5 yrs ago, I was hospitalized for my anxiety and a nurse directed me to do jumping jacks to alleviate a panic attack"
"She left the room and came back 30min later, very confused that I was still crying and doing jumping jacks"
"They took me off the anxiety meds I was on cold turkey and didn't know what to do with me.

Ive also taken several meditation classes that didn't do jack."
"No, I do not feel this way because I do not have the symptoms you're talking about.

Those things are not inherent to ADHD"
"You may have a comorbid anxiety disorder, especially if you are already being treated for ADHD."
"Yep, those things you listed do next to nothing for me"
" What works is peace and quite, unfortunately it's near impossible as I live on a busy street"
Yep
 The only thing that seems to work is when I go for walks outside
 Ive been scoping around for personal trainers and one of them introduced me to the medicine ball
" Oh, yeah, 
I think everyone with adhd can benefit from the medicine ball"
 All you do is slam it down as hard as you can
 It's a good exercise to get out all your anger and pent up frustration.
"I'm not sure, but think I agree"
"I went on a silent retreat, and when they instructed to ""clear all thoughts"", I was like, ""ALL TEN!?!"" Of the 3 meditations - sitting, walking, and work - sitting was the hardest"
"Walking and work are great ways for me to focus on 1 thing.

Music albums, on repeat - preferably loud, soundtracks, without lyrics - have been my go-to for decades for waking calm"
Sleeping is an ongoing struggle.
I started taking Propranolol for the anxiety you describe before my formal diagnosis
"I'm still on a very small dosage, I take it half an hour or an hour before anxiety-inducing things like driving"
It changed the way I drive completely; I don't forget to breathe and can finally feel confident in my abilities
Definitely worth talking to your doctor about!
The cold shower thing is something I learned in therapy
They also suggested freezing an orange and rubbing it on your face 
Ooh I was just prescribed this for occasional anxiety attacks but haven’t tried yet cus I’m too worried it will just make me sleepy
What dosage do you take?
Or holding an ice cube in your hand!
"10mg up to twice a day, I'll take 2 if I'm driving for the day"
"The side effects weren't too bad in the first two days, I can't remember what they were now since I've taken a few new meds 😅"

"> if there’s any supplements I could be taking alongside my medication to also help with my adhd?

There aren't any that have any kind of scientific research to back them up.

Of course if you have any deficiencies that cannot be addressed via nutrition, then supplements can help, and since some of those deficiencies can exacerbate ADHD symptoms, this may improve your symptoms - but don't just drop supplements willy-nilly or based on a wild guess, get some bloodwork done to figure out whether you actually have any deficiencies, and if so, which ones"

Ahhh! I’m so glad it works for you
I’m terrible at transitioning out of enjoyable activities
I’m like a junkie with anything interesting
Putting it down or tearing my attention away is sooo f*ing painful mentally

He was not a good father to me growing up, at least not entirely, had anger issues and took them out on me for being weird, now I'm trying to keep things nice and civil because getting on poorly with him would cause issues with other elderly family members but honestly he can go screw himself."

The issue I see is in relationships is..
"What's your coping mechanism.


I know soooo many ADHD people who will say, you never told me!


For myself, I tell my partner"
"""I'm never going to remember this and you will have to tell me again."" I remind them, that retention is difficult for me so they're expectations are set.


If they tell me they already told me"
I apologize
"A white lie of, oh that sounds familiar now that you said it"
"Goes a long way.


Sometimes when I ask questions I'll open with, you must have told me this already or, you probably already said this but...


Empathize, and find other coping mechanisms"
Ask them to text you
It's a pain that the burden is in them but it is part of the ADHD puzzle
"Your partner will have to do a lot of extra work to keep you motivated.


Find ways to reinforce positive behavior and show your appreciation"
It's easy to take it for granted.
Classic😂
My partner and I are both AuDHD
"

We do this to each other all the time"
"It's annoying, but it's how our minds are"
We just laugh it off or move on and remind each other of what we missed
I have TV shows and movies I need to rewatch cuz I don't remember a second of em.
Every fucking day
" I got the line “if you really cared, you would remember what we talk about.”"
"Yes, this is a point of contention in my relationship"
It especially happens when I'm on the phone with my partner
"Here's how I've handled it:

Interpersonally
- Told my partner that I understand their frustration with it, and that forgetting things they've said makes me feel insecure because I don't want them to think I don't care
- Told my partner what I planned to do to address it, and followed through on that promise 
- Asked my partner for their patience with this and to participate in my solutions

Practically 
- I don't listen as well when I'm multitasking and the second thing is very engrossing or requires real thinking/reading/writing"
"
--> If the thing is important, time sensitive, or I just really want to focus on it, then I ask my partner to talk to me later when I can focus on them better
--> If the thing isn't important, like scrolling Reddit, then I substitute with a task that will HELP me focus on my partner's words"
"For me, that means busying my hands, so I usually play Tetris, cross stitch, or doodle"
"
- I'm realistic about the fact that I'm going to forget things"
"My partner doesn't have ADHD, but they're prone to forgetting plans and important dates anyway.
--> My partner and I have a shared calendar"
"When I add something to my private calendar, I ""invite"" the shared calendar as well so that my partner can see it and vice versa"
"This way, I get a reminder on my phone that helps me remember what's going on in my partner's life.
--> The calendar also helps with rejection sensitivity"
"If my partner doesn't answer the phone, I can look at the shared calendar and see that they're busy! (They aren't always busy with something in the calendar"
"I still need to remind myself that they're allowed to just not pick up the phone without hating me)


The other part of this is, sometimes my partner actually didn't tell me about something and they think they did"
Usually this is because they told someone else and think they told me
"I've tried to be mindful of my own self-doubt as well as my own memory - if it's something I'm absolutely certain we haven't talked about, then I stand strong in that and say so, but I remain open to them and their feelings - after all, they're allowed to mis-remember too!"
Relatable 💯
Every damn day
 But he also forgets what I say and has no excuse soooo….
"Ha! 💯 My husband after a decade of marriage has come to understand my brain a bit better and just doesn’t balk anymore when I’m like “I think maybe we made plans, but I can’t for the life of me remember anything… do we have something going on this weekend?” Like, I can write it down, and if it isn’t in front of me or in my phone, it basically didn’t happen in my brain"
"Lol.

However, do be cautious… gaslighting is very real, and if there are serious conversations, things you agreed to that seem uncharacteristic, implying events you have no recollection of took place, I would be keeping a very close eye and recording things somewhere safe (locked phone, private app, etc)"
"People with adhd and mental health issues are often targeted by abusive partners because we can be easier to manipulate, sadly"
We often depend on support persons like family and partners to help keep us functioning in a predominately not adhd world and it can make us vulnerable
"Please keep your safety at the very forefront of your mind, and if your partner isn’t willing to learn about adhd and show some compassion, they may not be the healthiest choice for you.

I’m sending you lots of compassion and hope that your partner comes to a better understanding of your needs and how to work together in your relationship!"
"Lol yeah, that's why I ask for things to be texted to me, so it's there in writing."
I usually get the comment that you have already told me this a lot
"

It's funny sometimes, but I feel bad when I do it, maybe like four or five times at the same topic."
Yes
 And I seem to have selective deafness if I’m doing something else when he’s talking to me
I don’t have a clue how to change this!
100% I have to ask my husband to repeat himself all the time and I feel horrible
"Even though my ears are listening, my brain isn’t taking in anything lol"
All the time
My wife is aware that I have ADHD so she is patient with repeating stuff..
she just gets angry when I swear that I've never heard of something before when apparently I just forgot
"But thwt is due to stubbornness, not ADHD"
Nahhhh they never actually told you
I would forget about my ex being vegetarian over and over again
"She made an exception for game, and as I almost exclusively cook game I rarely had to make adjustments for her diet"
"On the rare occasions I was cooking some other meat, well.."
"she got really annoyed.

In professional settings I always carry a notebook and take notes, but I'm not sure a spouse would appreciate that when you are trying to relax in the evenings."
My ex gf said I have the memory of an 80 year old man with dementia
She’s not wrong
My husband and I both have adhd
And we both forget whole conversations
And we both get annoyed 😂
I’m that partner that gets frustrated
 I feel like his mother having to constantly remind him to write it down or put it on the calendar
 It’s been horrible on our relationship.
Yes
 Absolutely
" My ex would get very, very mad that I forgot whole conversations"
" But once she realized how common it was for me, she would gaslight me constantly and make me question reality, telling me that I must be miss-remembering"
 But I don't always forget everything
" I finally realized what was going on and that relationship ended.

So watch out for manipulation and lies"
 ADHD people can be taken advantage of if we aren't careful.
"This is something I came to realization recently, especially with my two closest friends"
I tend to remember bits and pieces of things but not everything
Even though I do try my hardest to pay attention to what they say
I’ve also noticed this at work where I’m told to do something and then it’s like part of the thing that was said came out of my head and what stays in my head gets corrupted because it’s no longer complete
So I have to ask again
It became more frustrating the more i became aware of it
Both my closest friends have gotten mad at me for forgetting key details or even instructions
You are not alone! Our brains are rather scrambled
It’s best for the other party to know about this so they take it into consideration.
I've got her to write notes in places I'm guaranteed to visit in the house if I need to remember something important
Oh yeah! Thats a huge thing I hate about it lol
Because of my forgetfulness my roomate said I'm annoying because I ask her the same question more than once now and then and honestly that hurt me cauz it's not like I'm being intentionally annoying and it triggered my RSD( rejection sensitivity dysphoria)
"Oh man, the amount of times I’ve done this with my wife… I could write a book… I’ve promised her things, completely forgotten and then when she comes to collect, and asks me if I remember, I usually don’t 😅😅"
It's valid to feel that way
"In my case, I experience this with everyone else but not with my partner"
"He also has ADHD, our conversations are something like this:

*We talk about something*

*Both of us get distracted by something*

*Get back to the conversation*

Him: do you remember what we were talking about?

Me: No.

Him: It's all good, me either :D

My partner is one of my biggest support"
He is the only one that understands what it is like to live with this disorder
❤️
Do what you can to retain it
"  For example,  put away all distractions such as phone"
"  Turn off TV and computer screen  

For complicated discussions,  break out a notepad"
" 

If the discussion is about specific future plans, do pick up the phone long enough to add it to calendar complete with reminder notifications."
"Well, my husband likes to repeat himself so it tends to work out until he tells me something that reaches critical mass and I remember it, ha ha.

Realistically, I'm actually NOT paying attention if he just starts talking out of the blue"
 I can't even tell him what he just said
" We've made a deal that if he's trying to tell me something important, he makes sure he's broken through before starting any actual conversation.

If it's something he needs me to do ""later"", he also sends me an email"
" 

Like I saw someone else say, I do a lot of ""I can't remember what you said about x"" or can you remind me about y"" sorts of conversation starters.

But also - this is how I am"
 I do a lot to be functional and present in our lives
 I'm doing my best and he knows it
" We've been married for 15 years now, so he mostly seems lovingly exasperated instead of actually MAD at me.."
"In the same way I am with his issues.

If he was actually angry with me over this, I'm not sure I would stay with him."
Oh god… yes I forget things all the time
My partner is very patient.
Every single day
Almost every single conversation
Especially if he’s foolish enough to ask “what do you think?” Instant void between my ears.
"I'm all about that 5th paragraph!  My partner is also ADHD so there's an understanding there, but I rarely assume they havent told me something, I always assume I forgot"
 Where the smart money bets.
"If a movie was made, this would ve the scene everyone would wait for and then say, what the comment above said :D"
Forgetting tv shows is the best! I love rewatching shows because it's like watching them for the first time.
Which sucks because there is really no way to guarantee that you will never forget something important
"

You can forget to remember not to forget"
You can forget that you've forgotten something
You can forget that it even exists.
"I was looking for this comment - yep, that one's a good one for setting off my RSD stab-in-the-gut feeling..!"
Whatever you need to do in a healthy way: if there is manipulation going on talk to a trusted mental health professional who has experience with this
If they are taking advantage of your memory deficit at any point they are with high likelihood doing other shady shit
Be safe.
You are absolutely right
"

I was in a relationship with a person that realized how often and easily I forget things and started gaslighting me"
"

But I'm generally observant about behavior"
 And I started to notice the way she acted when she was lying to other people and realized that she was doing those things with me
" Once I knew all her tells, it was pretty obvious what she was doing.

Always have to be on the lookout!"
"My boy friend likes me taking notes as we talk, and makes me reflect him"
"

It’s just hard when something happens, I say “if I do ___ please do ____”, express a boundary, or say something is okay and then later he does what I ask or say will be okay and I get upset, because I completely forgot"
"

Those things he has started insisting we write down"
"Its working so far, but we’ve only been together a year"
"My friend is dating a woman who always bets on the dumb money and it drives me mad. 


Like B, you can't remember any appointments, you forget to eat for days, yet you think your photographic memory boyfriend is gas lighting you about which restraunt we all agreed to meet up at yesterday?


My mom was hyper ADHD and was big on telling people they told her the wrong time"
And I swore to never be that person.😅
"That's so sweet! Lol I get so frustrated tho cuz I'll be talking to someone and they will be like have you watched this show? And I'll be like ""yeah but I can't tell you a single detail about it.."" and it just makes people really weird and uncomfortable when you have no feedback on things you say you are really into 😅 they just think you're bullshitting or something."
"I remember when I was going to buy drugs on the street, and I got there and realized I forgot the money"
"My friend was waiting in her apartment, and she said: I never believed that you were so forgetful until now"
I thought it was just an excuse
"But no way would you forget the money on purpose and walk all that way.”

I was like: you didn’t believe me???? All this time?? I’m really honest"
Partly because I can’t keep track of lies lol but also I think it’s a symptom: being scrupulous.
Lol I can't lie either! 😭😂😅😂 It suuucks sometimes.

"This sort of initial ""hump"" of getting started on something is even hard to deal with while on medication, which makes me think it's actually part of a coping mechanism since the meds don't actually affect those, perhaps fear of failure (emotionally shielding yourself from failure by being able to tell yourself that you didn't even try).

For me, without medication the task would remain, throughout, as impossible as it seems at the start, so it doesn't actually feel any different while on medication and trying to start something"
"I've found that once I actually start the task though (even having to force myself), that continuing to do it until it's finished is not actually difficult.

I hope that makes sense, it was kind of hard to describe the different states so please let me know if I need to clarify anything"
I hope it can help you.
"Are you in therapy? 

Your school likely has a counseling center and/or an office that provides tutoring and accomodations"
"Yes, that means you need to ask them (yes, I know, my executive function is usually on vacation too)"
But you already did most of the work by posting about it here
"

Copy and paste what you just posted here into an email to the people at your school whose job it is to support you"
Granted I'm assuming you are in the USA
"By letting them know your frustrations, they can possibly help you come up with an approach that works"
"In any case, so it will be work and at times it's gonna to suck"
"

They have seen it all and believe it or not, they've probably helped people in far worse situations"
"There is nothing wrong with using the services you pay for (in the form of those student fees) to help you in finding out what works for you.

I'm back in school at 50 years old to get my MSW"
Taking just  one class per semester and doing research and papers again is agony
"Everything I turn in, I'm sure it's hot garbage (imposter syndrome), but I keep getting good grades"
"

You can do it too, but at times is going to be a lot of tedious boring work, it's going to suck and there's really nothing you can do about it but to slog through it.

"I don’t have any tips for rise, just solidarity :/"
Yeah unfortunately meds don't make us want to do the work
"It makes us able to focus on the work, but we still have to choose"
"

That's why therapy is so important if you are able to get it."

i’m sorry that definitely does not sound like fun
In so many ways I consider my life to be absolute miserable very few things to be really enjoyable and just most things suck from the simplest things to hardest are so freaking complicated and challenging that I find myself enjoying so little things
But what you’re having to deal with seems like more challenging where the thoughts coming in almost create real physical action at least for me I don’t always have that challenge where I can at least think them and let them go before
Something comes to take his place
"One thing a therapist has suggested which might work for you too is to try a journal every day, and the idea isn’t to be completely thorough and describe everything you’re doing although you can if you want the ideas basically just to start writing on a daily basis whatever feels like what you wanna write about but the ideas so that you can look back on and over a few days or a week or month and I can see where you’re tracking and where you’re going for me anyway time is a challenge so it’s always kinda hard for me to look back and see how much time is gone past or what I’m doing now versus what I wanted to do last week or what I said I was gonna do two weeks ago and maybe that concept would help you a little bit too"
Just give you a little bit more visibility into what you’re actually doingand give you the ability to kind of control or dictate where you go and what you do
Wow that sounds like a really good idea
I haven’t journaled in a while
Maybe this is a sign to start back
Thank you so much
Yeah I started trying to focus on just being instead listening to my brain so much
"It’s challenging but the more intentional I am, the better"
Focusing on even the smallest details of whatever I’m doing 
I also wear a rubber band around my wrist and I pop it on my wrist through out the day to keep me from being in my head too much
It helps
Some might find it weird to pop myself with a rubber band but it helps lol.

Factor isn’t horrible.
I have a cookbook called The Ultimate Meal Prep Cookbook
"It has 25 weeks of recipes, and I've found that it's pretty easy to swap ingredients I don't like or don't have"
"I made something last night that called for carrots and sweet potatoes, and I swapped for beets and normal potatoes"
Turned out great
"

It was about $30, so if you can afford that I'd recommend looking for a meal prep cookbook"
I feel like paying someone to make meal plans would be cheaper tho
If I don't find anything then I'll give factor a try
"Have you used them and if so, anything to look out for or avoid?"
It’s typically wayyyyyyy more expensive to have someone make your meals depending on which city you live in.
"No no, I must've been misleading in my post"
"I don't want someone to make me meals, just meal plans"
Someone to help me make recipes and plans for how I myself can make quick meals during the week.
Have you tried asking a chatbot like copilot? They're actually pretty good at that sort of thing.
Yeah your post isn’t good; it doesn’t clarify what you’re looking for
I have a dietician I think that’s what you want
Very inexpensive
Happy to share my experience via chat
But I don’t know what you’re trying to accomplish

I think a good first step would be to look at what medications your  insurance will cover
They usually have a table online
Then find out if there's a generic
"Your prescriber's office can usually do this, but if your prescriber is just working by themselves it might take longer to do the legwork"
"Most medication manufacturers have assistance programs to get the out of pocket cost reduced, but they're not very ADHD friendly, as it's a lot of paperwork"
"

The crappy part is that sometimes you have to play the insurance game, where you try a bunch of different meds, nothing works, and then your doc writes to the insurance company explaining why you need this particular medication and if you're lucky, then they'll cover it."
"Have you found out why they won't cover it and if there is criteria where they would cover it? 

I do not take qelbree but checked my insurance out of curiosity"
I have blue cross blue shield also but not in NC
"Mine says qelbree is ""non-preferred"" so by default they don't want to cover it, but they will if you have inadequate response or intolerance to one of their preferred non-stimulants, including generic strattera"
"

I'm not trying to say your insurance will have exactly the same criteria as mine, but I definitely have had experience with other medications where they will say no to things because they haven't been given the right documentation"
"So it's worth finding out their rules.

Apologies if I'm only telling you things you have already tried :)"
I was diagnosed as an adult
 I'm disabled and 64 years old
I'm on Medicare Advantage through United Healthcare
 It pays for my generic dexmethylphenidate (Focalin) 30mg daily.
1
Have the prescription request sent to the pharmacy
"
2"
"“Not covered”
3"
Cool
Ask for a prior authorization
"(This has to be done by your doctors office but talk to the pharmacy, sometimes they request it from the doctor or you have to)
4"
"Tadaaaaaaaaa—-likely covered 



But if not then just play the insurance game as in try what they made you try first"
You might get lucky
Thank you!
Thank you! This was very helpful!
Thank you!
They did do a prior authorization.

Got my diagnosis and here's my take on treatment

I wanted to do something with Air Planes and Rockets
As boring as NASA TV can be I would have it on in my bedroom all the time
I decided I would to go to school for Aerospace or Mechanical Engineering as I also liked to build things and tinker
"I like math, but my memorization of different rules and properties sucked no mater how hard I studied"
"

Prior to trying to going back to school for my engineering degree I tried to teach myself programming and even took a community college class to learn and it didn’t click"
My family had history in medicine and I naturally had an internet for how things work and fixing things
I got my EMT certification and Ambulance Drivers license by my anxiety kept me from getting a job
"(Side note: My Mom and a friend of mine who is a pediatrician think I would have made a great doctor.)

After 3 semesters of an Engineering program, taking a required programming class for all engineering majors, and getting C’s in Calculus and I needed B’s to continue, I changed majors to software engineering"
It clicked
But it also has many benefits for us ADHDers (see r/adhd_programmers)
"For me, being a poor college student who prefers hands on learning, the cost of materials was cheap (free) I don’t need money to go buy materials or parts to make things"
"If I wanted to try something new, I could watch some YouTube videos on it, download some software and try things"
"

I can apply my skills to anything, build websites, making videos games, physics simulations, automating board games and finding an optimal strategies"
These are things we can leverage our hyper focus on
"The dopamine I get from any of these things is identical or better to what I would get if I played a good video game all day.

I know work in the Aerospace industry, developing modeling and simulation tools similar to video games but for real life but also work in AI, human decision making, large language models, and mentor students.

All of that to say is, picking a specific degree is only temporary"
It just shows you can apply yourself and learn hard things
It also shows you at one point knew the things in your degree
"But your ability to learn and apply concepts is the most important part.

My engineering school had a wide range of Engineering programs from Mechanical, Electrical, Software, Chemical, Biomedical (which for many was a stepping stone to med school) and Civil"
But more importantly your first year was identical for all engineering students to allow you to get a taste of a little bit of everything
"Even change my majors 3 semesters in wasn’t a big deal and I still graduated on time without issue.

I hope my wandering story of my journey is helpful"
"I will finally say no matter what, learn to code, start with python"
"If you can understand some basic concepts, It will be a lifelong tool for any technical person."
I'll tell you off the bat that it's gonna be real hard to do medicine or law as someone with ADHD
There is a LOT of memorization that goes into those fields and the one thing I can guarantee you he won't want to do is sit down and memorize them all
"Even if it's novel at first, it will get less stimulating over time"
"Also, remembering each individual edge case law or symptoms of some disease are going to be much harder with executive dysfunction.
I'm not saying it's impossible to get into positions like those, (in fact, I've heard some people with ADHD excel as paramedics or nurses) but if he's not set on doing those, I'd recommend avoiding them because the education for it will be tough."
"I can't speak for everyone, but I think (based on my own experience) people with ADHD tend to excel in positions that:
- Are different everyday and won't trap you in only doing the same daily tasks
- Provide opportunities for problem solving and provide unique challenges
- Have a regular schedule (in other words, clock in and out with breaks at the same time every day)

This can be a difficult balance to find, but having something you're interested in helps a lot."

"Can you afford to see a private practice to be seen by a psych sooner? Can you call the office you're currently booked with and explain to them the urgency of the situation so that they may squeeze you in if they have a cancelation?  

It took me over a year and a half, 4 different doctors, and multiple appointments to finally get meds (usa) and I was really struggling"
I relied heavily on coping mechanisms and supplements
"

The following are absolutely not substitutes for meds, but personally helped me survive in the interim"
"

The thing that helped my inattention most was a high DHA omega 3 fish oil"
"Unlike caffeine, it gave me energy without a crash"
Magnesium threonate helped with my anxiety
A good B-complex helps too because many of us ADHDers have the MTFR gene mutation
These are all taken in the morning because they can inhibit sleep
"

If possible it's always a good idea to get checked out for deficiencies by a doctor"
Things like vitamin D deficiency can really exacerbate ADHD symptoms and magnesium deficiency can exacerbate anxiety
Talk to your GP about it
"I don't know much about NHS but perhaps NHS could cover supplements?

Sorry you are struggling"
Sorry to hear this
I feel your pain
I was diagnosed only after my second child
"I can say medication made it a lot easier for me compared to my first child.

Try to get a private consultation; this is what I did, and it was faster"
"But if you still can't, I advise using Saffron temporarily"
"So doctors will tell you there is no evidence yet, but from my experience and also Reddit topics, Saffron has an impressive power to calm ADHD minds.

I always mix 200 mg with tea and drink it throughout my morning when I need some help with medication."
Sorry to hear this
Have you tried other ways to manage your ADHD in the meantime?
"I would gladly pay private for meds but because I’ve already been diagnosed there’s nowhere to just pay for the meds… 

I told the GP that I was not in a good way"
There’s nothing she could do apparently
"

Before I was diagnosed I told them it’s ADHD and I’m just awaiting for my assessment but I need help"
I told them I wasn’t depressed
"I know what that is, and I’m just struggling with symptoms of ADHD"
"They offered me Citalopram twice, and I walked out"
"

It’s frustrating because I know how happy I’m capable of being, but my heads a scrambled mess and my inside world has basically collapsed over the last 2 years.

I work for myself so I’ve always managed my symptoms around it"
"So I was coping, until I wasn’t"
"

I’ve had bloods done"
My hemoglobin levels were at around 12 I thing twice which is low
Doc said it’s nothing to worry too much about
"Everything else was fine.

I currently take Magnesium G, B complex and zinc"
Meletonin every so often
"My diet is pretty good, and I don’t drink"
I do however survive off coffee and nicotine
"

Will try omega! Thanks for the reply 🙏"
So I can get a private consultation even after being diagnosed? I’m struggling to find information on this
"It’d be incredible if I could.

Yeah as I mentioned to another person, I was coping really well because I was working for myself in something that I loved"
"When that interest shifts, and you also have a child, everything just came crashing down and it hit me like a train"
"

Will look up Saffron! Thanks for the reply"
Helps a lot!
Hey! I’ve tried absolutely everything
I’ve even had a life coach for the last 4-5 months
"I’ve literally based my life around managing symptoms.

I have noticed I’ve been burnt out a lot due to a decade of robotic work, and also picking up a lot of illnesses due to my son going to nursery twice a week aha… which makes symptoms harder to deal with.

I’m just a shell of my former self and I feel lost because I just require that extra help to hopefully help my brain from running at 100mph 24/7.

I should say, I’m also asd, which doesn’t help as my hyper focuses turn into obsessions and addictions"
"

Doing everything possible, and stayed away from drink for many years."
"Ugh, that stinks"
"Hope the omega 3 helps!

Are you taking the magnesium glycinate at night? It can make some people sleepy"
Just throwing that out there just in case.
Yeah it does
I have a lot of anger and sadness due to how pathetically bad doctors and professionals have been with me over the years
"

I am, alongside Zinc"

"You need to ask, do you want to vent?


But also, since you see this pattern"
Validate his feelings
"And jump in the angry boat with him.


It is hard to have 2 people in the vent boat at once especially if you escalate. 


and he will slip into solve more to chill you out.




Him: my peanut butter and jelly doesn't have enough peanut butter.


You: let me see! OMG that sucks"

"I'm going to sign up for 10 Yelp accounts to leave bad reviews, I'm soooo pissed.


Him: well, I bet if we ask them to remake it they will.


One thing for you to consider, Most problems, are just conversation points"
People don't actually want solutions..
They just want to connect and talk to people and venting is a way to bond with you
So when he brings a problem he doesn't want solved or with an obvious solution and you answer with the solution..
"It might come off as socially innept, or worse, rejection"
"Like you are offering a solution because you want him to shut up.


It's not logical, but it is emotionally what happens to some people with this dynamic.


One last point.."
Giving solutions often feels emotionally like you're giving someone work
"So another trick to de escalates these situations is when you are tempted to offer a solution, instead frame it like....


Hey, let me fix that for you!"

"Stick to protein & veggies.

I am not a scientist, or doctor, or psychologist, or even reasonably rational human being. 

But I wonder if you’re actually maintaining a kind of low-level anxiety"
"The constant mid stress of starving yourself helps you sustain your executive function? 

You gotta find a way to capture that without the stress"
Endorphins from working out have helped me
(I’m 3.5 years into diagnosis / treatment
43 years old)
The data on potential physiological benefits of fasting and ADHD symptoms isn’t really there yet to say it’s a supported technique or not
With a history of disordered eating (and no specifics as to what that entailed) I really wouldn’t recommend it to you without close supervision.
"You might just need to change what you eat, some foods can make you really sleepy"
I used to have sandwiches for lunch and was completely useless for an hour and a half afterwards
Now I make myself a salad and I'm fine
"I won't lie, having to make it the evening before is a pain, but it's worth it"
When I can't be bothered to do it and I end up buying a sandwich I really regret it.
This is soooo real!! So annoying
I believe personally that it has to do with the activation of the parasympathetic nervous system after eating
"The body goes into “rest and digest” mode when the parasympathetic nervous system is activated, which can result in lower energy and drowsiness for anyone"
I think we as ADHDers may be more sensitive or affected by this process than other people.
My solution is making a frozen fruit/veg/sunflower seed butter smoothie and sipping throughout the morning so that I can take a late lunch (like 2 or 3 pm)
That way I have like 5 hours of productivity before I have to eat a solid meal and feel drowsy
Taking a short walk after a meal really helps too.
"I am undiagnosed but this is me, has been me my whole life"
For this past year Ive been sick with stomach problems which cause me to get super anxious if i skip meals so I have had to start doing breakfast after almost 40 years without
"The fatigue, mental fog and lethargy after eating causes me to feel like i am useless and can’t do shit anymore"
But it’s either that or crippling anxiety and muscle stiffness if I don’t eat
I wish i could go back and have my fasting clarity.
Maybe try only eating a big meal
I eat cereal with milk and then have a big lunch/dinner
That's it
Around 2800 kcal overall
Takes me 10 mins combined to make both meals.
Is it possible that you have other (physical!) conditions besides ADHD? Peoplewith ADHD often have a number of comorbidities
"I won't name any specific conditions obviously because it could be so many things, but I will tell you my ADHD meds can only do so much and I've been diagnosed with several conditions that seem to contribute to my dysfunction. If I truly want to stay functional, I need to plan my meals around my activities, and even skip or postpone meals, and it sucks so much."
Interesting
 Before I was diagnosed I would go all the way until 5pm before eating for the same reason that you mentioned
" I wasn’t sure WHY I did that, but apparently I was kind of “self medicating” in a way"
"On the productive days where you don’t eat/eat very little, do you hit a wall and get panicky/jittery in the afternoon or evening? If so same, I don’t have any real solutions yet but same"
"I think it’s more about how much energy goes into not only making, but eating and digesting food"
"That energy you instead channel into doing other stuff and voila! You think you have more energy when hungry.

But unless that make-eat-digest loop goes on like a wheel down the hill it’s bound to wobble and fail"
Can’t starve forever.
"Fasting does help me 1000% I don’t eat till 2pm (usually coffee).

For me the reason is simple carbs tend to cause mental fogging and tiredness.

I (try) to have my first meal composed of high protein and veggies"
"And usually I’ll have my carbs later in the day.

That being said usually my gf will cook food for both us so I’ll still have carbs in the day and sometimes it’s too hard to not want to eat the same breakfast she makes haha"
"

Also this carb thing is definitely just a sensitivity I have to glucose and it has almost nothing to do with adhd"
It more just happens to make the symptoms worse coincidentally.
Same
 Eating makes me useless and I have to deny myself anything if I have to get something done first
" 

It's tough though cause I now have a physical job and need a very small amount of calories to manage in the morning."
I’ve gone off vyvanse
List too much weight and strength 
"I had a hard time loading my truck the other day.
  So now I’m unmedicated, eating more and just enjoying the resulting ADHD carnival ride"
"Are you productive because you don't eat, or could it be that you don't eat because you're being productive? 

When I'm having a ""good"" day, I get so absorbed in what I'm doing that I just loose track of time and forget to eat, and suddenly it's dinner time and I'm starving and I'm sure I only had my morning coffee 15 minutes ago"
"😅

Maybe those days where you eat something at lunch and then can't stop thinking about dinner are just the days you're less zoned in anyway?"
Get tested for metabolic disorders.
"i’m somewhat similar but with thirst, i feel like im im studying better"
wouldn’t recommend it ofc because water is essence of life
Look up post-prandial fatigue
It’s why you get tired after eating
I’m the same way
I usually have to eat a bag of steamed veggies to not get tired.
This happens too but then I always feel really faint when I don't eat
I quit gluten and it's not as bad.
"Just a thought — you may want to look into insulin resistance, as it can cause you to have a lot of “food noise.” I experience this too and at least part of the problem is being insulin resistant in my case!"
"How it goes for me is kind of the thought that I need to finish this thing, then I’ll eat"
Yes
I have same experience
I eat pure fruit smoothie for breakfast and morning snacks and have at 1-1.30 but must be a small otherwise I slump in the afternoon
I recommend you try eating fruit as it doesn’t give me a the slump
100% the same
It's nearly 7pm and I haven't eaten
I got a number of things done that never would have happened had I eaten lunch.
"IME if I stop eating/dont eat later than 9/10pm and dont eat until lunch next day...im a god at work.

  
medication 730AM, 150MG of caffeine around 830 or so = god tier status....eat something throws me off hardcore"
I always assumed it was the change from blood glucose for sugar burn/energy burn to fatty food burn or something like that
"I would suggest talking with a nutritionist to see if your food choices might be problematic, like maybe you have allergies you don't know about"
" That can be difficult to track down on your own, because sometimes the reaction you have to a certain food might not come until 24+ hours later,  Or maybe it's a certain food combination that is affecting you this way.

Good luck!  I hope you can find the answers you need."
me too as soon as a i eat i feel sleepy asf
Protein did the trick for me too
I'm still less productive than when i don't eat
But protein fruits and vegetables or just a shake in the morning are fine.
"Kind of a skeptic about ADHD generally, though I'm definitely afflicted by the symptoms, but anyway, what you mention was a gateway for me improving myself by basically listening to how I ""feel"" throughout the day for the first time in my life"
Not eating after waking up gave me a sort of driving anxiety which helped me focus
"I don't know the biology of it, but it makes for a different mental state than the way you feel after having consumed food"
"It makes kind of hunger you can live with, idk, not a panicked grumpy hunger"
However I've since become a lot more active during the day and so I switched to a small high protein no sugar breakfast
I.E
fat-free no-sweetener yogurt with coffee.
This makes a lot of sense to me because while I was active duty Army my eating was very disordered
"

Right after I passed my last physical fitness test I started eating regularly and I'm very happy even though I gained 50 pounds in 5 months"
"

Fast-forward maybe a year after I got out? I had forgot to eat or it been awhile and I was like, oh shit, I am locked in, I have so much energy and focus.

It pissed me off to be honest, going without food and getting hyper focused/productive felt like I was back in the Army and I hate it."
Same for me.
"That sounds really nice, what is your recipe? (If you don’t mind sharing 😄)"
This is difficult
" I had a similar issue and really didn’t like eating at all (former happy, chubby foodie)"
" If you eat/ drink healthy or plant-based, does the same thing happen?  My diet changes and my life changed"
 Hope you land on what works for you!
What dinner do you eat?
"My son used to do that, too, until he started getting some major problems with his stomach"
 It used to be fine for him to eat only one large meal in a day
" Then he started having stomach and intestinal pain and bloating with diarrhea and constipation (but not IBS) after his one meal.

The doctor told him he was surprised it took so long for him to develop these stomach issues!  He now has problems with gluten, although he doesn't have celiac disease"
" It also affects his emotions and impacts his sleep, and what he can comfortably eat is now very limited in variety"
" I don't fully understand why this way of eating caused him to have problems, but it didn't really get bad until he was in his 30s."
"Frozen mango, frozen organic strawberries, rainbow carrots, flaxmilk, & ~2 tbs sunflower seed butter"
In order of most to least
Our nutribullet sees a LOT of use
"

It's really good! You can add hemp protein if you need to feel fuller longer"
I keep it in a cooler bag with ice packs so it stays cold for hours

What is the biological mechanism which explains why stimulant-based ADHD medication can make me feel wakeful and sharp-minded while coffee can literally put me to sleep?

"ADHD meds are stronger than coffee, even a lot of coffee"
They're concentrated pharmaceutical stimulants and your dose is calibrated to pep you up
"

Caffeine is weaker, it stays in your system less, and you're not just taking caffeine pills but usually warm water and milk at the same time"
"

There are differing theories as to why caffeine makes some ADHD people sleepy, but the general idea seems to be that ADHD people are, essentially, put under a certain amount of stress by the lack of endorphins"
"They're often tired, but tired like an overstimulated two year old who doesn't want to get to bed is tired"
"They should rest, but they also want more stimulation for their starving brains"
"Caffeine isn't enough to perk you up to asymptomatic, but it is enough to take your brain out of stimulant starvation mode, allowing you to stop seeking it enough to rest."
"For me, coffee feels like a body stimulant - I have physical energy and want to use it, but my brain isn't ""awakened"" and sharp"
"Stimulants are kinda the opposite, though they do give me some physical energy I'm not bouncing off the walls, I'm more interested in mental exertion."
"Caffeine and amphetamines are both stimulants, that is true"
But alcohol and Benadryl (anti histamines) are both central nervous system depressants
"Drugs can be in the same class, but have very different effects"
Half of the reason caffeine works is that it tricks your body into thinking you’re not tired
Amphetamines actually provide you with energy
"They’re also way stronger, and “burn cleaner”"
I used to self medicate with caffeine pills and was taking 1200 mg - 1600 mg / day
"The “burst of energy” was short lived, and after a while, caffeine didn’t seem to have any effect on me. "
So there is recent research that suggests that caffeine is structurally analagous to a chemical called adenosine
"Your body uses something called ATP, or adenosine triphosphate, for energy, and produces adenosine as a waste product"
"This adenosine builds up in nerve tissue, and research suggests that the buildup of adenosine is part of what makes you tired"
"If you already have relatively high levels of adenosine built up, and you use caffeine, your body basically misidentifies it as more adenosine and says ""ok sleepy time now.""

Amphetamine and its analogues are not structurally similar to caffeine or adenosine, so amphetamine would not have a similar effect"
"

I'm oversimplifying, and need to dig up the source, but that's what I've got for you."
There are many reasons why we feel awake and feel sleepy
"But the short, probable, answer is: You have built up a tolerance for caffeine"
And (other) stimulants don't work the same way as caffeine
"

And stimulants are a class of chemicals that does different things, and caffeine is one type of stimulant, but generally increase your energy/wakefullness/attention etc.

If you really want to know the science behind it I suggest you start by reading Wikipedias articles on them, because there is ***a lot*** of science behind it."
"Something to keep in mind with coffee levels of caffiene is, it doesn't actually give you energy, it simply stops the signals from your brain for tiredness"
"Basically, it only stops your brain from hearing the signal ""I'm tired"", it doesn't actually cause you to be not tired."
I think it is a matter of dose
When i take my concerta 18 mg i also get tired but when i take higher it starts to work better.
So much misinformative bro science in these comments
"I dont claim to be offering a medical/scientific based response, so take this as personal experience.

Think about what happens when ‘we’ (I) take an amphetamine based medication—i can focus, my brain feels slower(more constructively guided) and im
less scattered"
 i’ve always wanted to give a pill to my wife and see what happens :) But since I haven’t.
"it just seems like some things act different on us.

I can drink, and don’t feel drunk or buzzed—which is one reason i limit alcohol intake, because i tend to drink more and faster resulting in higher probability of liver problems or alcohol poisoning"
"I can't tell why exactly this happens to you specifically, but generally stimulants seem to increase cerebral blood flow and coffee seems to lower cerebral blood flow."
Some authors suggest that adenosine accumulation may signal mental fatigue
"I'm not sure why, but I get the same effect from my ADHD med as well sometimes"
Probably chronic stress related.
"idk why coffee does that, for me its really hit and miss, some days it makes me tired, others it has 0 effect at all"
"generally it doesn't help at all.

but i self medicate with nicotine gum, i'd love meds when i can get them, but nicotine has genuinely worked wonders for me, i gave it a go because other people have said it helps them, and because of a paper i read showing it worked for adhd"
"it doesn't make me feel tired like coffee does, it gives me mental clarity and makes me feel awake with no fog in my mind, i find that caffeine paired with nicotine makes me feel almost super human even though the caffeine does nothing alone"
"

of coarse nicotine isn't great for you, but how bad it is, is greatly exxagerated because of its acosiation with vapes and especially cigarettes, which are both horrendous for you, but all of the cancer causing substances in tobacco is where most harm comes from, the nicotine itself plays a small part"
"of coarse its addictive, but taken as a gum its much less so because it take longer to hit, and the peak is much more subdued and spread out over time"
"

basically if coffee doesn't work for you and you cant get meds, give nicotine a go, just for the love of god dont vape or smoke to get it."
Coffee can make you dehydrated which can make you sleepy.
We suffer from a lack of Serotonin in our brains
Its a chemical neurotransmitter that helps pass signals between synapses
Our brains break down and re-uptake (absorb) it too fast which causes a host of issues
Most ADHD medications are a SSRI (Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitor)
They cause the Serotonin to stay longer in our brains and that allows our brains to function better
That is my understanding of how they work.
">but the general idea seems to be that ADHD people are, essentially, put under a certain amount of stress by the lack of endorphins"
"They're often tired, but tired like an overstimulated two year old who doesn't want to get to bed is tired.

I have never in my life heard someone try and explain the sensation this way but it's 100% what is happening.

The idea of being overly stimulated to the point of psychological fog and exhaustion is exactly what my bad days feel like"
Just maximized by 200%.
"Yup, I always explain an ADHD brain works kind of like a car that idles poorly"
"This covers why these meds work for us vs people who don’t need it, and why self medicating can help or even relax us.

If you’ve worked on cars before at idle you need a certain amount of fuel going in to our engine"
"When not enough gas (or brain chemicals) get to the engine, the car sputters"
"It’s running, but it’s running poorly, and using less gas than normal"
"Which means it needs to run longer to spend all the gas.

So this ties in to sleep too and how we don’t seem to get tired at the normal time, we want to be awake longer, even if we’ve felt like shit all day"
"Because our engines aren’t tuned to use up gas/brain chemicals at the right amount to end at bed time.

If a normal car is idling, it does so smoothly"
If you hit the gas on a decent idling car it’s rpm’s are going to fly up and it’s going to sound scary and is using up gas faster than needed
"Meaning they’re amped up and have a huge crash too soon.

For us, drink some coffee? The idling smoothes out a bit, you can relax, you feel calmer.

You take your meds? That’s even more gas, the car runs smooth, the car can hit some high speeds now but it’s all smooth and efficient"
"But also, you’re going to run out of gas (good thing)"
"End of the day you might feel exhausted, your brain chemicals are all used up for once, you can actually sleep right away.

The medication titration is about trying to get the right balance to run smoothly all day and run out of brain chemicals at around bed time.

So yeah, adding gas to a rough idle helps smooth things out"
Adding gas to a well idling car revs its engine unnecessarily
"We chill out, they amp up."
This is pseudoscience bs
"ADHD meds aren't ""stronger"" than caffeine"
That is a meaningless statement
They are different molecules and act differently in the body
"""Concentrated pharmaceutical stimulant"" is also a bs no-meaning phrase."
"I dont think theyre ""stronger"", just a different thing"
Give me a huge amount of caffeine and Ill get tweaked tf out but in a bad way
Excellent explanation!  I learned something today!
I really like this - it’s the best explanation I’ve ever come across for how the two affect me!
This one makes sense as well
" 
  
I can 100% feel my heartbeat increase from a few cups of coffee but then feel nothing else of benefit"
It's like revving a car's engine without anybody at the wheel.
God I need that so badly…
"During the day I have tons of energy, but no desire to focus, just whatever interests me"
"At night I want to do all the things, but my body is tired."
"> amphetamines actually provide you with energy.

Maybe I'm not understanding what you're trying to say in pharmacological terms, but doesn't energy come from food? In what way do amphetamines provide you with energy? And what about methylphenidate which is not an amphetamine but IIRC the most prescribed adhd medication?"
So that's why I felt absolutely awful after taking Benadryl...
Your body can’t “misidentify” a receptor antagonist as an agonist
"  
  
In some cases (with low levels of the receptor’s endogenous ligand), an antagonist can technically increase receptor activation because most antagonists are exceptionally weak agonists that compete with the endogenous ligand for receptors"
"  
  
But that’s not very relevant to caffeine."
I'm not sure it's about tolerance
"The very first sip of a quad shot mocha I had after very little previous coffee intake (less than a cup a week, the quad shot was a barista error and given to my dad for free along with his requested drink) knocked me out"
"Like, literally"
"Middle of the day, on a weekend, I took a single sip, stumbled over to the couch, and was out"
"I usually take an hour or so to fall asleep on a good night.

I have since increased my tolerance to caffeine, so it still makes me a little tired physically, but the static and anxiety in my brain still drops so that I can focus more on a single task"
"Like, I'm tired enough to do just the thing I'm trying to do"
"If I'm already tired though, it can put me out.

I saw an Instagram video where some guy was talking about how caffeine essentially makes the ""feeling things"" hole bigger, so if you're happy, your happier, if you're sleepy, you're sleepier"
"I'd never heard that before, and I can't remember the anatomy/biochemistry terms used, but I did think, wow, that makes a lot of sense, at least for how it seems to affect me."
Interesting
"I feel that way with caffeine, not ADHD stimulants"
"Adderall is the most effective for me, but it also puts my body in fight or flight mode at the drop of a hat"
It was great to feel so *not tired*
"I even had mental space for bits of Sisyphean tasks, which usually feel so overwhelming"
"

Methylphenidate and dexmethylphenidate are better than without, but they only give me enough mental space for my job, but not the extra that I need to get home stuff done also"
I think I'll try Vyvanse next.
Interesting about the alcohol
"Why do you think that is? I used to be able to drink A LOT without much effect, except physical coordination, but now I'm an extreme lightweight"
I think it might have been my unchecked anxiety.
Omg I think you're onto something
Theobromine that's in chocolates seems to wake me up and I read it increases blood flow
While caffeine momentarily tightens the blood vessels and also helps me focus enough that the noise in my head can be faded enough to sleep
Maybe that blood flow change is doing something.
Wrong on many levels
"  
  
SSRIs are not psychostimulants, and not commonly used to treat ADHD symptoms"
And “Lack of serotonin” is not really the cause of disorders that SSRIs are used to treat.
Replace ADHD with depression and I think you're on to something
But I don't think this is how ADHD works
The first week of being on meds I took some migraine pills (like otc paracetamol and caffeine) and boy did that suck
It freaked me out so much I stopped drinking caffeinated coffee the next day
"

I told my psychiatrist about it and she said coffee and like „pure” caffeine in pills are two different things"
"So i could be safe drinking coffee but ok too much for a coward to try (on meds, also no need I guess decaf is alright)"
"

Coffee sometimes makes me sleepy or just does nothing (as in before meds)"
But tea always perked me up and I wonder why that is ? :)
"Oh man I cracked up when I read that description too, and went yelling to my wife about it - I HAVE KIDS and .."
"yeah, it's exactly like that"
I'm like an overstimulated two-year old
"I sometimes just can't make myself put down the book or the tablet or the laptop and go to bed, even though I feel bushed."
The sense of feeling understood and validated is so crucial
Thank goodness for this sub.
"I tried to explain this to my doctor - ""I have energy now!"" ""Of course you will, you're on adhd drugs."" ""No no no, but like I'm not totally exhausted all day every day, like I feel awake in the daytime and then tired at night rather than nodding off all day long! It' amazing!"" Doctor totally did not get the significance."
I agree there’s some pseudoscience involved in the comment
"  
  
But, to your point, amphetamine is both a more potent and more effective psychostimulant"
"So it’s fair for someone to call it “stronger”, because those are the two ways to measure drug “strength”"
" 
  
Your point that the two drugs have different effects because they have different pharmacology is true"
OP wants to know “why” differences manifest in certain ways — but no one can really provide that answer
Their subjective experience with the drugs are not universally shared.
It's really not.
The most prescribed ADHD med is Adderall
Long form methylphenidate (Concerta) is number 2 or 3
"  Idk much about the pharmokinetics of amphetamines, but maybe they help the formation of ATP (as far as creating energy goes)?"
You’re right that they don’t create a source of energy (you can’t feed an animal amphetamine as food)
" 
  
They’re both psychostimulants which suppress the perception of fatigue"
Your body still becomes fatigued (worse performance over time) but you don’t notice until the drugs wear off
"  
  
It’s sort of like how you could hike with an injured foot on painkillers, but when they wear off you’re going to notice it cost you."
"In this case it's not caloric energy, but essentially uping the signals in the brain"
"I guess it's like electricity production vs distribution for an analogy.

Caffeine's main wakefulness effect simply comes from blocking adenosine from activating the sleepy receptors, compared to ADHD stimulant meds which specifically up neurotransmitter levels in brain."
Doctors / vets will usually suggest giving Benadryl to kids and pets on trips or if theyre stressed for whatever reason so they chill.
"I mean it sounds like you know what you are talking about, and I'm paraphrasing a research paper I read at least a year ago, so I should really dig up the source and see what you think"
"

I definitely understand the whole ""can't misidentify an antagonist as an agonist"" thing, otherwise using Narcan would be a total crapshoot."
I switched depression and ADHD in my head before my meds kicked in
(see my other reply).
Tea has theanine in addition to the caffeine so that might be why you react differently
If you like tea you might try matcha because I have found it has an even greater effect than regular tea does
Coffee makes me feel a little anxious but I never get that with regular tea or with matcha
My mom (also ADHD but can’t take stimulants) even likes the decaf matcha because she feels like it gives her a little boost in the evening to wrap up chores.
I had the same thing happen in the beginning but it was an energy drink that triggered the freaking out lol psychiatrist told me that effect will taper off after while and he was right
"It was enough to stop drinking energy drinks for a while tho! 

Happy cake day!"
Omg yes defo!
I think in the US you're right but in the EU and UK I think it's concerta
Anyways all I meant was to ask if it's the same for those.
No.
Actual energy comes from food
"Stimulants make you more motivated and alert, which can trick your body into thinking it has energy and drive you to burn energy built up in the body"
"There is the biological affect of a substance, and then the perceived effect that we observe"
"Typically they align, but we can paradoxically perceive the opposite, even if that doesn't match the underlying chemistry."
It has both? Interesting :)
Thanks for happy cake day didn’t even notice !! ❤️
"Oh, my bad! I thought it was the same since both are legal there as they are here."
"Your comment sort of implies that the drug is having the same physiological effect for everyone, but we have different subjective experiences because of some erroneous perception"
" 
  
Really, our subjective experiences are different because of differing physiological response to the drug"
"  
  
The *pharmacology* is the same for everyone"
"The *physiological* response differs, and with it the subjective experience."
Adderall is not sold in UK
Just vyvanse (elvanse).

i am so unbelievably bored i think i don't know what is worth living for

Yet, there's a lot to experience and explore, despite life's unpredictability"
People become bored when they stop challenging themselves
"

You don't need money to enjoy life"
"Just try new things, take risks, and keep an open mind"
"Pick a hobby, give it a shot, move on"
Discover new passions
"Meet new people, learn from their passions"
"

Life's fulfillment comes from finding meaning and purpose in what brings you joy"
"Don't be afraid to take chances.


tldr; make a hobby of finding a hobby or meeting people or observing the world around you.

"Get evaluated, could be a chemical imbalance that needs to be corrected."
"My biggest challenge in life is finding that perfect sweet spot between boredom and stress, because it seems like 99% of things in life are either boring because I don't care or stressful because I care too much"
"Honestly, this restlessness you describe is always a sign to me that a depressive episode is coming on, or that I’m in the middle of one"
I have Bipolar type II in addition to adhd
"I am on an antidepressant, a bipolar medication, and adhd medication"
Do you have a psychiatrist? I would highly recommend making an appointment with one and asking about possibly getting medicated
Depression and adhd often go hand in hand
I know EXACTLY what you’re describing and it truly is physically painful
I’m so sorry you’re going through this
"In the midst of it, it absolutely feels like it will never end and this is just your life, but it does get better if you’re being treated."
"If you work and study, could it be burnout? 

Maybe you need more variety or adventure in your life...

Wander in to a local park/zoo, try geocashing.

Can you do swimming?"
"no exactly i'm a student at the moment and i feel like im in a cycle of perpetual boredom just waiting for the next thing to do but i can't do any of it because im too busy waiting to need to do something i feel like i want to smash my head to bits because why is waiting boredom so physically painful

repetition of classes and work and waiting for the next time i have class or work are actually my worst enemy i feel you so much id love to take a job that suits me but i need to have my degree and experience in order to get that job so its just another thing to wait for"
i'd love to take on something like that i have volunteered in the past but with the hours my job requires of me and then having time to do all of my uni work its not feasible i just spend my time between classes waiting to go to work then my time between work either forcing myself to do uni stuff or waiting until i next have class/work
its the waiting that's pushing me over the edge i think i just can't take knowing ive got to fill time and finding something interesting enough to do in that time yk? thank you for your help anyway though!
"Yep our institutions are very poorly suited to our type of brains, it is SUCH a huge problem"
"I have a therapist at the moment who is AuADHD and her kids are as well, and I dunno maybe with some cool parents/mentors you could find a way through school/uni that wasn’t excruciating"
"But if you’re in that type of family that says ‘our institutions are solid’ and ‘listen to your teachers’ etc etc it’s all very fucked up.

I don’t know I guess some people get fast-tracked"
I feel like if you get lucky and find a mentor you can maybe have a good life
"My life is pretty bad, have been thrashing around my entire life trying to find a path but it hasn’t worked out.

I’ve done good work in multiple industries but can’t seem to be left alone to just focus on good output"
"Everyone wants me to be different, or act different, or think more like them or just like them personally or something"
Why are they all so needy?! They are just trying to reinforce their stupid norms.

"If you enjoy it, it's a good choice for you :)  
I didn't study CS, but pivoted towards CS/data science later in my studies, and ended up working in data science.

What drew me towards programming was a combination of two things - one is learning things by active participation, as in building projects, experimenting with algorithms and so on"
"The other is the instant feedback of getting an error immediately if something's wrong, and iteratively hunting down the mistake and fixing it.

In contrast, I don't learn very well from just reading or listening to a lecture and attempting to absorb it"
It becomes too easy to zone out and just sort of ignore the bits I didn't really get
"Handing in a problem set and getting a corrected version back a week later does very little to improve my understanding.

Random advice that past-me could have really used:  
\- Take more charge of your learning"
"Build stuff, do stuff, try things out and see what works and what doesn't (and why)"
"Don't try to just take in a book chapter, test if you can explain it to yourself (or others)"
Put into words what you don't understand and why
" 
\- You're not stupid or bad at your field if you're having trouble following books and lectures"
"Many of the people who teach and write textbooks are very good at their field, but not necessarily good at communicating to others"
" 
\- Some teachers, authors, even fellow students will actively downplay the difficulty of the material (like ""we'll examing a \*trivial\* example in the following"" or ""it is simple to see that \*insert complicated math\*"")"
"Don't fall into the trap of thinking that you must be dumb for struggling, then"
"It means they're insecure and trying their darndest to appear Very Smart at all cost.

Memory is the building block to good learning (thanks captain obvious)
Specifically training better recall
"If your ADHD is stopping you properly spacing your learning (like me) it'd be a great place to start IMO.

I would suggest you listen/read to *Make it Stick* by *Peter C Brown*"
It's a great book about memory and has some very interesting thoughts on learning techniques — and in particular spaced practice vs
"rote/massed practice.

Half of my battle — outside of the appalling sense of timescales/deadlines when at university — was the feeling I could cram and still just about pass"
"It created a false sense of security in my recall abilities and etched the wrong feedback *signal*, i.e"
"""I'll get by if I cram it all last minute"""
It's not true and I've accepted it to completely accepted as the weakest method for learning
"It won't work, by comparison, and will not help you carry the material into later life"
"Also re-reading the same text over and over is not productive either (really great to know this now even for those without ADHD).

By contrast the effectiveness of space practice/learning is measurably better and helps build a more structured approach to learning"
"The key for me was finding structure to memorisation and trying to form a habit around it.

Now that I'm considerably older I'm learning (obsessing) about memory techniques – the value I'm seeing in proper spaced learning + other learning skills (memory palaces, interleaved practice, mnemonics, peg systems etc) is eye opening"
"I've also realised that all the stuff at uni I crammed/re-read and just about squeaked a pass with, has all but disappeared from memory"
I recall almost none of it
"(caveat I was also drinking heavily which definitely didn't help).

But returning to that material now using memory/learning techniques I am far more confident with it - and a year later it's still very clear."

Do ADHD folks have a weird perception of time?

"Oh yeah, it’s common"
 I try to make use of the five minutes before a meeting and end up joining ten minutes late…
all the time.
"""ADHD, to summarise it, is time blindness.""

https://youtu.be/wmV8HQUuPEk?feature=shared (it's only 8 minutes, but an amazing lecture to watch)."
Recently diagnosed with ADHD-Inattentive Type here
I can confirm it’s definitely an ADHD thing
I struggle a lot with time management and being punctual because of this so you’re definitely not alone!  I always think I have more time to get stuff done when in reality I don’t and it always backfires horribly
☠️
"Yea I can lose entire days to zoning out, especially if it's been a hard or stressful week"
"

Tends to be worse if I know I have something to do later in the day or have something I should be doing now but really don't want to"
"

I have even caught myself saying ""I can't go in the shower now (9am) because I have therapy at 3pm."" Before realising it's nonsense and I have time"
"

I think it's partly a response to getting in trouble a lot for being late or missing  things growing up.

So instead I sit and wait/procrastinate/zone out until it's time to do something"
"

Also partly a processing thing to unwind all the stress of the week."
No perception of dates either
"Like I intellectually understand that 7 December is 14 days from now but I have no intuitive understanding of how long that is, how much work I can get done between now and then and if I have a deadline on 7 Dec it won’t feel “soon” until maybe 3 or 4 Dec."
"Yes! And not only that, also time perception over longer periods of time is completely fucked up for me"
I started working in a lab I'm at rn 3.5 months ago and I feel like I started 2 weeks ago 🫠
"It's either now or not now, which is why it can be hard to finish things or remember to do something that is just outside of that 'now' window"
At least that's been my experience
It's like my brain just wipes it completely out of memory until something brings it back up.
Yes! I have no ability to understand how time passes
5 minutes feels no different than 5 hours and it's maddening
"I don't know how to train my brain to understand, or if that's even possible to learn this? 
Alarms work to an extent, but it'd be wonderful to just retrain my brain."
Jep..
I have always lost time..
"In a scale of minutes, or hours, kind of depends on the day and level of urgency.."
"And it really doesn't help that I live pretty far north, which means the daylight/darkness ratio changes a lot with the seasons.."
"We're down to about 7ish hours of daylight, and in the next few weeks it'll shrink to 5,5ish hours, before it starts growing again.."
"I've blinked in daylight and felt like I opened my eyes again in complete nighttime, on several occasions recently..."
"> With no phone or distractions, I just stayed in my room (too hot outside) and ended up staring at the wall, entertaining myself with random stuff like trying to spin my fingers in opposite directions and thinking about life"
"I didn’t feel bored at all, just kind of zoned out

This would be fucking excruciating for me & I'll simply go to sleep 🛌🏻"
"I didn't see anyone mentioning the name, in case you want something to google.."
"The symptom is called ""time-blindness"" and is very commonly associated with ADHD."
Studying during college with ADHD is the worst
Sit down around 11:00am and then all of a sudden it’s dark outside
Yeah…time is an interesting concept lmao
"I work well under pressure, so until I’m stressed, distraction is a thing."
Dr
Russell Barkley gives a good explanation: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHgbNGPZphc&t=632s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHgbNGPZphc&t=632s)
Yes
I’m late  a lot
I take 3 X as long to do something
Time is a mystery to me
"Whether it seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months or years."
I do experience time distortion but I have no idea how you manage to not get crazy sitting on your couch doing nothing
"I'm not hyperactive but 'doing nothing but twiddling my fingers' is one of the most stressful actions I know, and I used to work in rescue service."
"I have no perception of time whatsoever.

If I take a day off with nothing scheduled, that day is over in about an hour.

That person who texted me yesterday actually texted me two months ago.

My kid who has a birthday coming up in a couple weeks? It’s tomorrow.

Time is a virtually meaningless concept to me."
yes
"40 f here and was diagnosed just a few years ago, but i've always had a weird concept of time"
"things are either too slow or too fast, and i never actually know what time it is, as in, i have no sense for it."
"Can definitely lose track of time, but I don't have the skill of sitting in a room without any power twiddling my fingers in various directions and finding myself fully amused"
"😝 no offence to the country but regular power outages is a no from me, f*** that."
I’m on time if it’s an event or work thing and I’m early for flights
"For anything else, I hate to be rushed"
"Hate it!  

It drives my wife crazy"
I clearly can’t tell time.
"Time sometimes feels like a conspiracy theory, tbh"
"Very difficult to convince my brain that 5 minutes and 5 hours are different in any kind of material +/or predictable way.


One of my biggest obstructions to work is the Shutdown Mode that engages if I'm asked to estimate how long a task will take me"
Nightmare
"I get literal hives, like I'm allergic to time"
(it's likely just a stress rash but that doesn't sound as cool.) 
Oh 100%
On days where I miss my medication (either for planned off-days or waiting for refill) I definitely lose all sense of time progression
"12 hours can go by and I wouldn't even be able to tell you anything I'd done because my perception is that only a couple hours had gone by while I was ""waiting to wake up"""
100% -- and it affects every aspect of my life
I do for sure
"I wondered why I hadn't spoken to a friend of mine thinking it was semi recent, then realised it was 6 years ago that I last saw him"
"

I get to places very, very early (to the point it's a running joke with my girlfriend) and yet I've got people in my phone who I've not replied to in weeks, thinking it's days"
"

I'm a full-time graphic designer and I'll be the first to admit that I've had freelance gigs fall off because of this strange time warping that happens with communication etc."
"What you’re talking about is basically a facet of “time blindness”, which is a main component of ADHD"
"If you want to learn more about the disorder, check out [these videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhbAK1pdPM&list=PLzBixSjmbc8eFl6UX5_wWGP8i0mAs-cvY)"
"Dr Barkley talks about this and many other issues we all face, sand he does it in a way that doesn’t feel judgmental or patronizing."
"Unscientific reply: OMG YESSSS (cries, bangs head on table for unknown amount of time)

Scientific reply: Do some research on this topic"
"It's mind-blowing!  

Comparing Time and Event Based Prospective Memory: Effects of Delay

I heard it on NPR a few years back - these researchers are digging in to how we perceive time"
"In a nutshell, we (humans in general) process time in one of two ways"
We look at the CLOCK or we're tuned to an EVENT
When I started talking to my family and friends about this - it set the conversation on FIRE
I'm clearly EVENT based and my spouse is clearly a CLOCKWATCHER...hoo boy we've invested time in finding our peace on that
"My BFF, her 9 yr old son is a clockwatcher, but she is event-based and they fight about it *daily*"
"

I'm really only beginning to understand it"
"What I do understand, though, is how we manage time is programmed into our biology"
I feel nearly terrorized as an EVENT person living in a CLOCKWATCHER world; it has left me feeling stupid and behind when I know I'm *not*
I really hope researchers and therapists continue to dig into this important aspect of human development
I know SO many good people who suffer at the disruptions of their own time mis-management
"I do also have a deep sympathy for the CLOCKWATCHERS who have *no idea* of what it's like for us, but still are tied to the relentless chaos of the EVENT-based folks."
Yes
   It’s not even consistently fast or slow
 If I try to test it by doing something for what I imagine is 8 minutes - 5 minutes will have passed
" Next test, 15 minutes."
"What perception of time? 

Time blindness is super common with ADHD, throw dissociation or executive dysfunction into the mix and you’re just not going to win"
😮‍💨
No concept of time whatsoever
I’m 42 & medicated
I honestly think it’s getting worse with age.
Yep
"I’m obsessed with watches and am also always late to things, even important meetings and whatnot"
"And it’s the same thing every morning where I get in the shower with 40 minutes to be at work (I live very close to work, commute is about 7 or 8 minutes) and think I can be ready to go in 5 minutes, though I have some routines for moisturizing as I’ve gotten a bit older"
"Anyway, I pop a nice watch on and holy crap! I needed to be well on the road by now! So yeah, time blind for sure."
Yes
usually if im doing something in my normal routine i can do something on schedule.
lets say I have to pick my daughter up early from school
I tell myself she's off at 12 but will still forget and still proceed to continue my day as if she's off at 1 and then realize.
wait I have to LEAVE early to go pick her up too!! It's so annoying
why is my brain this way.
Notoriously so. 
IT’S WHAT TIME?!?!?
My therapist says ADHD is a disturbance of time processing
I struggle a lot with being in the moment and not (over)thinking about the future and that's also a part of that.
"My watch has this feature where it can chirp every 15 minutes with a more complicated chirp at the top of the hour.

I turned it on, because without it, I don't actually notice the passage of time."
"Yep.

I know logically that an hour is 60 minutes and a minute is 60 seconds"
A month is around 4 weeks and a week is 7 days and a day is 24 hours
"

I know the logistics behind time"
"

I just have a hard time knowing how long it takes.

I have alarms for everything and I have timed my habits to be able to get ready on time in the morning"
"

It’s not fail proof but it works."
"Somehow, I've always had a great internal clock"
" I set my alarm, but always wake up 5 minutes before it goes off"
" Also, during the day, I'll go hours without looking at my clock and think, ""It feels like it's close to 3:15 PM."" I'll check the clock on my phone and, amazingly, I'm rarely wrong by more than 15 minutes"
Strange.
"I once spent 12 hours straight winding my entire yarn collection with my new yarn winder.

I did not in any way know that I’d done it for so long until my husband told me."
"I’m currently writing a paper on time perception in adhd, so yeah it’s seems that disturbed time perception is a trait of adhd accordingly to a lot of psychologist"
For me time slipping out of hand happens a lot but not that extreme
 doing something for what feels like 5 min but an hours passes
But according to research distractions and time in nature can help to ease the symptoms
I have a timer with a buzzer in my office solely because I lose time.
Time blindness is an extremely common trait in ADHDers
I’m infamous for it.
"""In what you perceive as time"" 

-Dr"
Manhattan in 'Watchmen'/Me to my girlfriend explaining how I have no ability to understand time
Whenever I get insomnia I don’t realize how long I lay their thinking of random stuff— so yeah lol
perception seems like a strong word to me.
Aka time blindness
Yeah that’s a common symptom
There are those with ADHD who are almost always late and there are those who are way too early
 I fall into the always too early group
 I somehow perceive my plans as something that every step towards requires a full hour to do
" If I have to be somewhere at 4, then that means I have to leave by three, which means being ready to leave at 2, which means starting to get ready at 1, have a meal at 12, shower at 11, doom scroll at 10, so be up at 9 am.

This is why I cannot make plans for anything the entire day if I have something to do at 4 pm"
 Even if that event is just for 30 minutes
 My entire day is dedicated for that one event
Dude it’s the fricking best when you’re not doing anything inherently entertaining but you’re not bored
Thinking about life…
Sorry
Can’t answer right now
 I’m rushing out the door because I’m late to pick my kid up from a birthday party.
"Yeah, and it's worse in some people than in others, and for different situations.

When I'm out and about, especially with others - errands, shopping, at a festival or something - my time sense is generally very on point.

But if you get me into a flow state about a thing I like then I might not eat that day, lol."
Most definitely
Many refer to this as time blindness.
Time blindness is 100% a thing
"I am either stupidly early for something important or late enough for it to be slightly aggravating, but not too annoying"
There is no in between
" 
I put appointments in my phone at least 15 minutes before I actually need to be there and still end up late"
" 
I also plan to turn up early, so free up whole days around important appointments so that I can be early and end up late anyway"
" 
At this point, I just own it."
time is either soooo slow or too fast
"Yes very common in people with ADHD, it's called time blindness"
"I have a lot of ADHDers in my life, and not a single one of them has a clue how time goes for other folks"
"They'll say ""I will be ready in 5 min"" and half an hour later, I'm calling them, like ""Where are you?"""
I have Taptic time settings on my Apple Watch and it dings every hour and I love it.
I travel a lot for fashion shoots by train in the UK
I'm ALWAYS three hours early
"However i spend two and a half hours wandering around the area, visiting shops, going for coffee, all so i can show up 5 minutes earlt."
I have no sense of time
I never could understand what “5 minutes” of time passed ment
Hell even 1 minute is hard to understand
"

Thanks for Alexa or else I’d be fucked"
I set timers for every length of time because I have no clue what’s happening.
Yes the time blindness is horrible
When I'm not on meds time is really slow but I have random pockets of time skipping
When on meds it's fast all the time
It’s called time blindness
"
It’s one of the symptoms that a person may have ADHD"
Its the brownouts and being entertained lol you don't know how many hrs have passed
"I grew up in the Philippines and weird as it is, i miss the brownouts 🤣"
It is not just you
"Yes, managing time is often a challenge for those of us with ADHD"
It’s one of our common traits….
I have a tendency to lose track of time when I’m really engrossed in something or hyper focusing
"The other end of the spectrum is, being so focused on time,  because I’m worried I’m going to miss that important deadline or get sidetracked, and forget that I can’t get anything else done. "
"Yes, I feel like time is seen as now or not now without any accounting for details in between"
YES
I felt like a complete failure and I decided to map out my life
I thought everything was about 4 5 years apart...It was 2ish..
Look into time blindness
It's a major symptom of ADHD.
"Yes it's pretty common in people with ADHD, for me the time is always whatever the hour is so 6:00pm is the the same as 6:50 pm I know logically that's wrong but i always initially see it that way, also time will sometimes escape me or move way too slow depending on the situation lol."
"Ironically, I've experienced time blindness on medication"
I focus so intensely that I lose track of time
Never did before
I don’t perceive it at all.
Time management is usually a huge issue
Advice for parents is actually to have a lot of physical clocks around their home so the time is always visible.
Yes
ohhhh yeah
i was recently diagnosed (32F) and some things started clicking like crazy
like when i was 18 and showed up to my job an hour early bc i didn’t know how to not be late.
time is weird
"When I get high on fungi, 10 minutes feels like an hour"
time was really slow too until about my 30s
A year is still a long time but it's much faster these days
"Dude, yeah"
"Hours and hours will pass and I’m like, “damn, it’s the end of the day?”"
"I think my ADHD journey and trying to come to grips with time blindness has fully reached the point of:  
*""time is just a social construct used by humans in order to comprehend entropy""*"
"I understand now and not now, and I’m surprised every time not now becomes now"
It's extremely common
I definitely have time blindness
It varies from day to day depending on my mood and what I'm doing
"I can lose myself in things for hours and not realize how long it's been, other days minutes feel like hours."
"sadly yes, at least i do—daily battle"
Yes
When hyperfocused it goes fast
"And it is hard to time when to arrive to work so I come most days 30 min early.

I drove to work on Sunday once, probably becuse I was drinking on Friday recovering saturday and thought that weekend must have gone, did felt that it went quickly..."
I unfortunately experience the opposite alot of the time
especially when waiting on something
I have a combined type adhd so my hyperactivity and inattentiveness combined cause me to absorb and take in everything quickly and thus processing quickly
so it can feel like 5 or 6 minutes but its been 2-3 minutes
or feels like its been 30 minuyes but its only been 10
basically the quick intake of info causes me to become bored when waiting so time feels so much longer
however if im actively engaged in something im interested in 2-3 hours can pass but it only feels like 30 mins.
"Yea, I have a really hard time gauging how long it takes to get ready and leave to be on time without somehow panicking in the last part and tacking on 5-10 min"
"BUT weirdly, I noticed that at any given point during the day or night I can guess what time it is and am usually very very close."
Time perception difficulty is a symptom of adhd
i work night shift and time has no meaning anymore
"

at"
all
"

i’ll get up at 4 am to make tea on a day off"
"who does that??                                                                      
i’ll go to bed at 12 noon, wake up at 10pm and then go to sleep at 5pm the next night"
"                              
i have no sleep schedule but im always getting 5/7 hours, so idk how that’s working"
Yes.
It's either time blindness or I stare at the clock for an appointment
I can't choose whichsometimes.
"I have many specific memories from my childhood, and each of them could have happened at almost any time from 8-13 years old or so"
Give or take a few years.
Yeah a sign of the executive dysfunction
Time gets away from me all the time.
Time doesn’t seem to exist in my mind I swear.
"Last week i had to go get a haircut, i had to be there at 17.30 and it’s like 2 mins from my house"
I was wfh so i stopped working at 16.50 and took a shower (washed my hair)
"I get out the shower and check the time, it was 17.15…"
"Holyyyyy shit! I quickly dried off, grabbed some sweatpants and a shirt"
I was there just on time
"I hate haircuts, because my hairdresser isn’t a typical salon lady, she doesn’t say much (anything)"
"I get out, i start my car and look at the time, it was 17.42!

How the hell did that shower feel like 12 minutes and it lasted 25, and my haircut felt like 25 minutes and lasted 12?!?

I have zero perception of time"
I always thinks a minute is longer than it is! 🤦🏻‍♀️
"I’m undiagnosed inattentive ADHD.
I have such a big problem with time blindness"
"I’m late to work everyday, my team leader is completely fine with it, but I really do try to not be.

My husband can’t understand why I’m always late for things."
I have wear a watch and check it frequently while working
"The amount of times that I think I have time for something only to realize I’m behind is every night.

Without the watch I’d be lost in my zone and racing to get my work done every night."
My bf makes fun of me all the time
I am horrible at anything involving time
"I constantly over- and under-estimate time.

ADHD: It’ll take me 40 minutes to cook dinner"
" 
BRAIN: Historically, it always takes you longer to cook than you anticipate"
" 
ADHD: I’ll recalculate, giving myself some wiggle room for each step"
" 
BRAIN: Sounds like a solid plan"
" 
ADHD: It’ll take me 5 hours to cook dinner"
" 
BRAIN: ……"
" 
ADHD: That doesn’t sound right either"
" 
BRAIN: No"
"No, it doesn’t"
" 
ADHD: I don’t know where I am going wrong…"
I have zero sense of time
"Whether it be the passing of time or even days, or how long it takes to do things."
Yes
"A common description is ""now/not now"", and is a major part in why planning can be difficult."
I taught myself how to play guitar over a summer one year
I’d sit down at like 3pm and play for an hour
"lol just kidding, more like 12 hours"
This happened over and over again for the rest of the summer
"So yeah, time is an artificial construct created by man."
I have no time sense
" If I'm not wearing a watch, it's either been three minutes since I last thought about what time it was, or three hours"
 It's like Schroedinger's time
 I won't know which until I observe a clock and collapse the waveform.
I feel like I experience time like Dr Manhattan.
A perception of time? What’s that? I mostly have good intentions though
🤷🏽‍♀️
"Time blindness, OP, is what it’s known as"
"For me, it could be anything from an estimate of how long I think something is going to take to composing an email"
"Like if I’m really down the rabbit hole, focusing, upon finishing my perception is that maybe 10-15 minutes have elapsed.

But no—it’s more like an hour at least."
"""Tomorrow I'm going to wake up at 9am and study all day.""

*Stays up until 2am the night prior*

*Wakes up at 11am*

*Eats and fucks around*

*Start studying at 1pm*

*Gets overwhelmed after 30 minutes*

*Takes a 10 minute break*

*Comes back to study after 30 minutes*

*Repeat last three steps all day*"
I am fully time blind
Time has no meaning whatsoever.
Very common
Time blindness.
It’s either now
Or later.
My perception of time is the most normal of anyone in the world's
"A lot of other people have a weird perception of time.

Actually I don't know how other people perceive time anymore than I know if their green looks the same as mine."
Abandon trying to be time efficient
Join some of us in staring at nothing for 30 minutes so that you are perpetually early instead.
I feel this
 Opened a spreadsheet to verify some numbers before a Teams meeting
 Got so caught up double-checking things that I completely missed the notification that the meeting had started
" Joined 10 minutes late to find 12 ppl sitting there waiting for me.

Stupid distracting spreadsheets."
I definitely join meetings late because I’m gonna get this last email out before the meeting and then realize 20 mins later I went down a rabbit hole
Sometimes I join as soon as the reminder pops up even if I’m super early just so I don’t forget
But I hate that too because I don’t want to waste my time making small talk
We have a few people I’m in meetings with often that just want to chat about their whole life and I just don’t
"I always have 100 hours to work in a 40 hour week so I really don’t want to waste any time I don’t have to, just get more behind and more stressed."
I used to have this problem
"Then I found ""[Outlook BetterReminders](https://ben-spiller.github.io/OutlookBetterReminders/)"" You can set the reminder to pop up when you need it and it will appear on top of whatever you're working on - even on multi-monitor setups"
It will steal focus so you can't just ignore it
I would be lost without this.
"Since changing jobs, I have missed so many meetings"
"I don't know how, but Outlook notified me 2 minutes before a meeting started at my last job, which was the perfect time for me to join"
"Now, I only get 15-minute notifications, and you best believe I'm going to use them.

I work as an engineer in a very technical role, yet I can't figure out how to get Outlook to do what I want."
I had to play with alarms (not timers or reminders) to find the optimal time for me to ACTUALLY make it to my WFH meetings on time
"

I had to Goldilocks it!

10 minutes: too much

On time: too little 

5 minutes: too much time to get distracted 

2 minutes: juuuust right! 

I have a rule for myself that I set a 10-minutes before alarm to “wrap up,” so I can start doing that, but know that…when my 2-minutes alarm goes off, I have to drop what I’m doing and immediately log onto the meeting"
"I’m “not allowed” to turn off or snooze the 2-minute alarm until I am officially inside the meeting, or I WILL forget within that time frame"
"

I don’t think people realize how many completely different trains of thought are running through our station at any given time"
"My “main character” - aka my attention - will jump on any one of these at any time - even 2 minutes before my meeting and I’ll go, “Just real quick…” and you know how that ends!"
I have to get to work early or I’ll be late
If my some odd chance I’m on time I feel rushed the entire day.
Or waking up two hours early only to get ready in thirty minutes and then still finding a way to be late.
"Click on 8 minute video, fall into you tube spiral, look at the time:

![gif](giphy|FoH28ucxZFJZu)"
ADHD late diagnosis here
"Thanks for sharing, I'm getting to learn and understand it better for my daughter who's also ADHD"
"Our time blindness combined it's epic, we're running late to everything."
"""You could be the smartest person in the world and still do some pretty stupid things."" 

This was a great video.thx for sharing."
"Also ""ADHD, to summarize it, is time hyperawareness."" I'm either gone for 5 minutes(4 hours) or every second is an eternity."
wtf is 8 minutes? /s
links to 10 hour video :p
This video made me so sad about myself and started crying
Do ADHD medications help with that?
Time either mysteriously evaporates at warp speed or drags by glacially
No in between.
I feel like “zoning out” is a term foisted upon us by those without ADHD
"To others, it looks like we are being lazy or careless by not paying attention to what’s going on around us"
"

The reality is that something interesting is going on inside our heads so our attention is fully focused on it! 

ADHD is less of an attention deficit and more of an abundance of attention that goes everywhere - even places we don’t want it to"
"Like….cleaning grout to make it a totally different color than what you thought it was, because you spilled bleach or some how found a “clean spot,” and now you need it to ALL be “clean.” Thanks, hyperfocus."
this!!!
I feel like this as well
" My husband has very classic time blindness, but I have way higher anxiety and am painfully aware of the time, because of all the ways I was shamed as a child for being late"
 Checking the time is a compulsion for me.
Do ADHD medications help with that?
"I will think, “I have had an appt scheduled for MONTHS for Dec 7th, which is a Thursday, like two weeks from now.” 

Also my brain: today is a Thursday.

Also my brain that evening: “OMG today was Dec 7th, and I missed my appt!”"
Do ADHD's meds fix this?
Do ADHD medications help with that?
"This sucks so much, especially with food in the fridge with the notice 'limited shelf life after opening' like.."
"Did i open it yesterday? Or 2 months ago? Clueless...
I end up tossing so much food."
"I started a new job in January of 2024, and I still feel like the newb!"
Do ADHD medications help with that?
Thank you! This is my experience but I never knew how to articulate it
"

The adhd coach that used cbt didn’t know what I was talking about and the only analogy I could come up with to describe the subjective experience was the character who couldn’t form new memories and who’s journal was filled with writing “I am awake” over and over"
"Whatever our deficit is, it’s probably why some “adhd hacks” don’t work in practice for everyone.

~~Dang it now I’m going to spend the rest of the night trying to figure out where that character was - it seems very Kurt Vonnegut-ish.~~


Edit"
"Apologies to all and especially him - he is a real person, not a character, [Clive Wearing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clive_Wearing)."
Do ADHD medications help with that?
"Same, my brain always needs to have something going on"
The line between being overstimulated and under stimulated is very thin.
Do ADHD medications help with that?
ADHD -PI as well
I am going to try this
Although do the chirps get annoying?
Either late all the time or in like this
Multiple alarms well before an appointment.
Well said. 
"It doesnt, no one sees color the same lol"
Waiting mode: engaged
"Honestly, this is me"
"Set alarms for everything, always have something to do in the meantime"
"I read webtoons, or web novels on my phone, or download phone games to play"
"One of my friends recently taught me how to download a game boy emulator on my phone, so I will probably never be bored again lol."
I always set an alarm on my phone for 1 minute before the event
That's my 'drop everything and get started NOW' reminder
"It's not long enough away to let me get distracted by something else (usually lol) so works kinda well.

Not as slick or seamless as having your usual notification system do it, but it works for me."
Being an ADHD parent to an ADHD child must be such a tricky experience
"You're not only having to swim harder to keep your own head above water, but now you've got to keep your kid above the waves too"
Solidarity for you both.
I find that I'm either super early to things or don't go
"When I'm having a moment of clarity, I set alarms and prepare things and give myself double the time I expect to do things"
With a baby and a toddler I double it again
"

Part of the difficulty of some advice is that they expect you to change"
It's difficult for us to develop new habits so you have to preempt your bad habits
I take my keys out of the door and will immediately look to put them down somewhere so our keyhook is the first thing I can reach when I get in
"I don't like wearing glasses to work so I'll automatically put contacts in so my toothbrush is on my contacts so I have to move it anyway and will probably use it to do so..

If I don't do this, I'll get up from the sofa or whatever with 5 minutes to go and then realise I'm not dressed, showered, fed nor have my bags packed."
"Oh sorry, let me translate: it's 480 seconds and the countdown starts NOW."
I mean.
what really is the difference between an hour and a minute anyway? 😂
"I don't know, never been medicated due to a multitude of excuses such as:
""you are fine..."" 
""There is nothing wrong with you..."" 
Or the recent since diagnosed 
""your blood pressure is too high""

No shit.."
"I've been alone with 35 years of panic attacks and anxiety and alcoholism to sleep.

Apparently I'm fine though.."
"I just need to quit drinking and my problems will go away...

I'm not on a waiting list for help.

I'm on a waiting list to drop out of uni, lose my job and actually go into crisis without it before intervention."
Good that I'm not alone
"Honestly, I don't fully know.."
"I'm not currently on any meds, but I was on Atomoxetine for about 7 months, and I won't necessarily say I lost less time, but I had better focus and more control of what I spent it on, and I had an easier time managing that without also losing track of, or getting distracted by, everything else.."
"So mostly I just felt like I was able to accomplish a lot more, which made any lost time a lot less critical to me.."
"I've learned to recognise that those instances of lost time, are usually my mind and body telling me it needs a break, but sort of disconnecting me for a little bit.."
"So if it happens too often now, I will try to actively take a break and recharge a bit, rather than try to push through to 'make up for lost time', so to speak.."
That has helped some..
But I can't tell you that meds help on it specifically...
Amen to that.
"This has not annoyed me yet, unless I forget to turn on sleep mode when I go to sleep"
 (I sleep with the watch on because of various built-in health monitors.)
"Cool!
On the iPhone or a different kind of phone?"
Yeah having kindle on my phone and gameboy/snes emulators
I can just go early to shit and sit in my car and read or whatever.
"I do this and you definitely can't set it for three minutes before, that's way too long not to get distracted 😂"
Welp
Worth a shot!
"On the iPhone! I just downloaded an app called delta, game emulator.



Then I went and downloaded some emulators off of https://www.emulatorgames.net because apparently Apple devices can download files? That part blew my mind"
"Then you just open the files in the app using the plus sign up top.



Only issue I’ve encountered is that sometimes the download won’t start on the website, but usually force closing safari and reopening the webpage fixes it so it pops up the download prompt"
I guess it’s a safari issue? Idk the whole thing is kinda crazy to me at how easy it was to set up.
"I’ve tried this, too, and without alarms, I would never make it into the place"
I can’t count the number of times I showed up early to an in-person job but forgot to clock in on time because I didn’t have alarms set.
"Three minutes? That's fine, it's just enough time to check my emails, send a quick text message, browse reddit and.."
dammit I'm ten minutes late
Again.
That’s sweet! I’m going to try it out too
"

Thank you so much!!"
Thank you for this wonderful info
My 80's baby self is going to be very happy.

"[""Hyperfocus"" is a very poorly-defined word](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00426-019-01245-8) that, in the context of ADHD, generally refers to two superficially similar -- but fundamentally different -- mental states: flow and perseveration.

Flow is a positive, beneficial state of deep immersion and high engagement in a task or activity, and is also usually accompanied by enjoyment of the task/activity"
"It's something almost all people are capable of, and specifically is not a benefit imparted by ADHD"
"

Perseveration, on the other hand, is part of the ADHD disorder"
It is the inability to switch between tasks or mental activities
"It's that thing that makes you spend 10 hours doing something non-stop even when you know you need to stop and do something else.

Perhaps you want to try a few different medications and find something that works better for you
"I know there's quite a few that treat adhd as well as make personality changes, and if you don't really like yourself unmedicated the personality changes could be a bonus"

It might be a bit rough and difficult, as a lot of medications you have to stick to for a month or so to see if they work, but perhaps talk to a doctor and put together a list of off label and on label adhd meds to try"

I’m curious what medication you’re on
Adderall shortages seem to be regional
"I never had an issue, but others in this sub have pharmacies that just cannot stock it"
Or at least they can’t stock the necessary dosages
"

The doctors have to know there is and will continue to be shortages moving forward, yet they continue to prescribe the same drugs"
"

Will your doctor consider putting you on something else?"
I take Focalin
 My pharmacist says he can get as much as he needs and that it's not in short supply.

You didn’t say what your med was
"They’re all different, and they all cause withdrawal symptoms. 

And you have to not take your prescription for a month to get a check up? That doesn’t make any sense. "
Unfortunately I cant be prescribed my medication again till my check up has been completed
And I the soonest I could book my check up was 3 weeks later
Just bad timing tbh

"This might be controversial but meditation does help (at least for me it did), more specifically the concentrative type"
I used to run away from meditation before because it was just so hard
The key here is to combine it with something like a background noise or yogic practices or breathwork  to which you can focus on
"I feel like it has given me more mental clarity, helped with impulsivity hyperactivity and being present in the moment"
My recommendation is to start small and try to trust the process (i know that it is hard for us)
Although it can  backfire for some people too (you have to try it yourself to see the effects)
"Have tried tons of supplements, productivity tools, caffeine, adhd tips, generic drugs like modafinil (unfortunately stimulants are not very widely available in this part of India) but nothing worked to the extent meditation did."
thanks! I'll give it try
Staying consistent will be hard but hopefully even bits and pieces here and there will help
"Last time I tried it I would get so so so anxious, but I think I've worked through that"
Any tips for resources to check out to learn how to do it? I wouldn't even know where to start.

How do I start a conversation with unreceptive parents about my possibility of having ADHD?

"Yeah, this is a tough one"
All types falling under the adhd umbrella makes it difficult to explain anything
"

The hyperactive part comes in so many forms"
"For me (inattentive), it’s my mind"
"For others, they can’t shut up or sit still"
"

At this point, though, your parents will probably have to be part of the testing if there is any"
Maybe talk to the school psychologist first and go from there
And then they can speak to your parents as an expert
"

If you’re struggling in school, it could be helpful"
Medication can help you be on a more even playing field with your peers
"

If you’re not struggling, I’d say hold off."
I am struggling quite a bit
Last semester I failed twice and this semester I've also straight up failed two exams and just barely scraped through another two
Though I'm not sure if this is due to my possible ADHD or just because these subjects I struggle with are all just my weak subjects (science and math)
"For humanities I kind of did alright (I do really well in coursework for humanities but am terrible when it comes to exams.) I only tend to do OK in subjects I'm interested in, or when I have good teachers who are engaging.

I've always struggled with inattention, deadlines, organisation and processing info in class unless I studied by myself"
"But in primary school I was actually pretty ahead since my parents used to tutour me extensively and force me to study middle school level stuff and put me into weird programs etc, so the teachers would just let me sit by myself and read or do whatever"
"In my early years of high school I managed to scrape passes and even get really high scores at one point ,which I suspect was due to massive fear and anxiety-induced studying"
"But as soon as my mental health got better and my anxiety mostly went away and I felt happier, more like my true self, my grades took a nosedive.

Anyway, sorry for the ramble"
"my struggle in school is primarily why I want to get screened now and hopefully get some help, because I'm about to enter my final two years of high school and I need to be able to do well"
"The content has just been getting harder (and more) every year and I can't keep up, I'm getting overwhelmed"
"though I might hold off and see next year if I'll perform better since I'll only be taking subjects I am interested in.

Thank you for the advice btw! Especially the hyperactive part, I didn't realise the mind counts too"
In that case I might be hyperactive in some form because often I interrupt people or can't shut up even when I have nothing to say and get impatient when people can't keep up
"I also have trouble falling asleep because I'm constantly thinking about something, and I feel like I'm always thinking about different things at once so instead of prioritising one thing i'm prioritising everything.."
which prevents me from doing anything...

This is a CBT tool I use a lot for rejection sensitivity moments: disputing irrational beliefs
"Basically, I write down a list of everything I believe in that moment of intense emotional pain, no matter how absurd, and then I go through and question each belief before writing a more effective belief. 


So for example, maybe I'm upset that no one laughed at my joke in the group chat"
"Maybe my beliefs are: 


-They all think the joke is stupid
-Everyone is annoyed with me now
-Everyone just tolerates me and thinks I'm super weird


And so on"
"So if I take the third belief, I might ask: 


-Can I know that everyone thinks I'm super weird?
-Do I laugh at every joke from all my friends? 
-If I don't find all my friends' jokes funny, does that mean I think they're super weird? 


Et cetera"
"Then I can change the belief to something like: 


-My friends in this chat didn't respond to my joke, and it probably has no bearing on how they feel about me. 


What this does for me is creates space between the intense emotion and my brain, giving me time to calm down"
"It can also help me see that there's a little Fierywordess in there who's scared of an awful lot, so I can be with her and be the adult I needed. 


Obviously there is not always time for this kind of thing, but usually I can at least do a little with it"
"I don't usually like to intellectualize my feelings this much, but when it's something I'm obsessing over, I find this is a helpful exercise for interrupting the cycle."
I think awareness of what is rejected here is crucial
"Your partner doesn’t reject you, he doesn’t enjoy the feeling of being touched sometimes"
I don’t think you or your partner is the problem
"The problem is not distinguishing the two things I mentioned above.

Edit"
Obv respect his boundaries
Respecting boundaries is a wonderful way of showing affection imo.
You’re not alone
I went through something similar today
I had a really bad reaction to rejection when my partner uninvited me from something I was excited about going to with him and his friends
They were going to bars and stuff which I’m normally not a huge fan of but this time I was really excited to tag along
He told me he was hesitant about me coming because I don’t enjoy packed social situations (which he’s right about) and that he didn’t want to have to worry about my safety or me being uncomfortable and just wanted to be with his friends for tonight
Totally fair as he does spend a lot of time with me otherwise
"It just hurt more than I expected and made me feel like I was a liability, and it sent me down an anxious thought spiral and I’ve been going through it for a few hours now"
Not sure how to get rid of it but I’ve decided going to bed is the best thing I can do
I totally relate to that intense pain of wanting to connect but being unable to plus the added bonus of rejection
I hope you can gain some clarity and I’m sorry you’re going through this too
Good luck
Try reading “the mountain is you” - it’s abt self sabotage and touches on themes of rejection sensitivity.
"For me personally, whenever I’m stuck in an anxious RSD infused rapid intense negative self loathing kinda spiral, I’ve figured out that pulling up the Notes app on my phone and start typing away to glory super fast like brain-dump all my emotions and thoughts and what I wouldddd say to my partner/ex/coworker/boss  if I was a “mean” person (if I’m angry) lol or what i would say to my partner or whoever that person was that rejected you, in a blunt and non-tactful way, just like literally letting my inner hurt and negative spiraling RSD toxic-demon loose!! But on paper or Notes app I suppose lol"
"Your partner is not gonna read this, it’s just for you! 

And then when I let it alllll out, and I’m all typed-out, and I finished letting out a good cry, and did whatever else my heart felt like expressing in private (this is typically all done when I’m alone in my parked car so I can ugly cry loud or scream or whatever I need to do depending on how bad the emotional pain is), then I stop, breathe, listen to a few songs or something, distract myself for a few hours, and sleep somehow thru prolly a few more tears if it happens.

Then I wake up the next day, and thennnn go back and read my entireee hot mess emotional note I wrote out on my notes app the day before"
"And then be like… damn, I kinda ammm a lil crazy not gon lie😅😂"
"And then I am able to read it all slowly and pick out where the adhd RSD parts were strong, where my emotions and points were more sound and what my valid points and logical reasoning was that caused or was behinddd the extreme emotion of rejection, and where my personal emotional wounds were triggered and where my personal trauma entered and played a part in my explosive painful emotional spiral/outburst"
"I’m more clear headed at that point, then I can formulate a way to facilitate a more even-keeled, calm, respectful yet loving conversation with my partner over this topic"
I always make sure to come forth with any emotion with my partner bc the transparency does wonderrrs in growing our love and trust and bond
"

But yeah sorry for the long winded response, but yeah this is my tried and true method for getting thru my adhd, sensitive RSD-infused lol strong emotionally painful moments in my life"
This situation of yours may not need all this^lol but I mean it’s just a method I thought I’d share for anyone lol.
Were your past partners more affectionate or past relationships more codependent? Cause that could be why it’s making you feel rejected if you just aren’t used to being with someone who requires that space
 I feel the same sense of rejection with my bf sometimes too
"Some ppl are just more physically affectionate than others so maybe he’s not that kind of guy, and he may be getting overstimulated"
"When you’re away from him try to distract yourself and stay busy, and while you’re together try to remind yourself that he’s a type of person whose social battery gets drained more easily"
It helps to tell yourself that it’s his social limitations and that’s his personality trait rather than a rejection of you
"Remind yourself that he loves you even when he wants his space, otherwise he wouldn’t be calling you his gf"
Just try to reassure yourself
I think adhd/add can make us more insecure at times
I know it does for me and that it does for my sister as well
"But in the end him setting boundaries isn’t a rejection of you and not personal, it’s just him communicating his needs when he’s feeling overstimulated"
I know that feeling
You magnify it beyond its actual scope and it’s a bit overwhelming and scary
It happens to me more when I’m really tired (like dog tired exhausted)
"

In those situations I usually do self talk or try and distract myself to bring myself down to a normal level"
If that doesn’t work I hide in bed
😂
"Please be aware that RSD, or rejection sensitivity dysphoria, is not a syndrome or disorder recognised by any medical authority"
"

Rejection sensitivity dysphoria has not been the subject of any credible peer-reviewed scientific research, nor is it listed in the top two psychiatric diagnostic manuals, the DSM or the ICD"
"It has been propagated solely through blogs and the internet by William Dodson, who coined the term in the context of ADHD"
"Dodson's explanation of these experiences and claims about how to treat it all warrant healthy skepticism.

Here are some scientific articles on ADHD and rejection:

* [Rejection sensitivity and disruption of attention by social threat cues](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2771869/)
* [Justice and rejection sensitivity in children and adolescents with ADHD symptoms](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24878677/)
* [Rejection sensitivity and social outcomes of young adult men with ADHD](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17242422/)

Although r/ADHD's rules strictly disallow discussion of other 'popular science' (aka unproven hypotheses), we find that many, many people identify with the concept of RSD, and we have **not** removed this post"
"We do not want to minimise or downplay your feelings, and many people use RSD as a shorthand for this shared experience of struggling with emotions"
"

However, please consider using the terms 'rejection sensitivity' and 'emotional dysregulation' instead.

"Saying it again, Google cpstd/bpd"
"Damn, ADHD is such a spectrum really because I experience the opposite"
"Why isn’t this recognized or researched as a AD(H)D-symptom? I’ve been diagnosed with ADD at a very young age, and for almost 20 years I wondered why I was so extreme sensitive for rejection (in every form) Nobody likes rejection of course, but my response/coping to it wasn’t normal or healthy"
"

You should say it was an ego-thing, but for example with narcissists (who also hate rejection a lot) it’s different"
"At least, with the way they often deal/react at it"
"RSD is not about boosting your ego, it’s more related to the fear to lose people/excluded by the rest, in my opinion"
"

I can’t believe that it’s coincidence that, after all those years I discovered that SO much people with ADHD are dealing with such a specific ‘symptom’"
There must be at least be an indirect relation between them
"But how and where? A lot of the other symptoms are ‘logical’ and easy to link to AD(H)D but with RSD i still really explain that link.

But it’s a symptom that it too specific and big to ignore, with can have a really heavy influence on your life"
At least it’s worth it to do more research
It’s not a ‘relatable’ just online invented bullshit-thing
Why don’t we see RSD back so strong linked with any other psychical disorder? Even not with social fear-disorders for example
Which would make more sense.
This does help so much
I use a version of this called the triple column technique that I learned in The Feeling Good Handbook by Dr
Burns.
100% I don’t think either of us are the problem but I do feel a lot more responsibility for the feelings cause obviously my sensitivity is making me feel so big
Whenever he moves my hands away I keep my hands to myself but I can feel myself wanting to cry or feel so hurt.
I think a major reason why I isolate from people is fear of something like this happening and knowing I won’t react normally like people do
I know I will take it to heart and not forget it
It terrifies me
thank you 🫶🏼
100%!! I know he’s specifically talked about certain touches just being over stimulating
Sometimes it’s just the way that I touch can be a lot if it’s rubbing over and over in the same place for him
"It’s crazy cause I have so much awareness of my mind and the thoughts that I’m fully aware that it’s rejection sensitivity, but I don’t know how to deal or handle the emotional regulation of that"
I did some EMDR tapping and meditation on anxiety today
But I know I need to do more
Overall my psychological anxiety has not been well
And I know it’s a lot for my boyfriend which only makes me feel worse 😀 I just wanna be okay for both of us why is it so hard lmfaoo.
"I don’t think I have BPD but I do know I have CPTSD, and ocd with themes or fears of being a bad person or making mistakes."
I very much relate.
"To me, a elder bpder who has seen so many different PD varieties that they might as well be trading cards,

They're the same thing, and cptsd is a more or less a rebrand"
"If you think of it as a spectrum, bpd nears the extreme end, but not quite as far as it can go (looking at you, DID)"
"I think if you're less extroverted and less prone to outbursts of anger you're less likely to catch the BPD label.

If you're younger guy, it's likely to get missed or written off as ""male aggression"""
"But I was never really ""aggressive"" as much as ""reactive"""
"I tended to get pushed to exploding rather than trying to assert dominance

If you're a younger woman and you ever outwardly express intense anger, you might get a BPD label"
"Any self harm is pretty much gonna do that automatically also, as there's a ton of misogyny"

"I would honestly go to a different doctor, because I don't know what 'research' they've looked at, but that's bullshit"
People don't 'outgrow' ADHD
They learn \*how to cope\* with it
That would be like telling someone with crippling depression that they don't have it anymore because they've been taking antidepressants that mask their symptoms.
Your doc is absolutely full of crap if they think people outgrow ADHD
"Not sure what they are reading, but it isn't research.

This next part is anecdotal, but I hope it is a useful perspective"
"

My wife also has a lot of childhood trauma"
"PTSD, GAD, severe depression, the works.

But she has always had ADHD"
The symptoms have been there since she was a kid
"Treating the ADHD has done wonders for her ability to regulate her symptoms and work through her trauma, as well"
It took like 7 psychiatrists to find one that would finally work with her to address the ADHD symptoms
"

Seriously, it's almost an indictment of the profession how many dogshit psychiatrists there are out there, fucking people up and regurgitating bullshit they don't actually seem to know much about."
Approx 10-40% of ADHD kids grow out of it
That means many do not.
"I only got diagnosed at 33 years old (this year).
I never outgrew my symptoms, they became so much worse and severe, and then diagnosed and medicated"
"
So lol to that doctor."
The average primary care doctor is not trained enough in that field to accurately decide if you need help or not.
".....it's called ""management improves over time."" as in...you eventually get used to managing your condition.


someone get this doctor some reading comprehension"
I had a similar problem during the diagnosis
The therapist said that the symptoms overlap so much that she wasn‘t sure if she could diagnose me
But she also asked my opinion on this and I told her that I have been in therapy and on medication bc of depression and ptsd for years and even though it has helped significantly I still struggle immensely with everyday things and executive dysfunction
Also my mom and my brother were diagnosed before me which also made it more likely to be adhd
"After that she diagnosed me and I started taking medication, Vyvanse is the first medication that helps me with executive functioning and having enough energy to be employed and still somehow have a life and kinda stable mental health"
"Have you been in treatment for your trauma related symptoms? Do you have a next appointment scheduled with your doctor?

I personally would ask for her sources for the title of the post, bc like others already have said it’s that people adapt - some better than others"
I do think that with appropriate treatment it is possible to accommodate so well for the symptoms you’re struggling with that it no longer impacts life so much as before treatment
Which doesn’t mean that the underlying condition isn’t there anymore
Iirc our brains can also benefit from medication through neuroplasticity so much so that the medication may not be needed at some point (my psychiatrist told me that but I don’t have any sources to back up that claim! It just made sense to me lol)
"

Otherwise I think it‘s a good sign that she wants to be thorough in the process of diagnosis and from what you have written here your doctor seems to be open minded"
But I also understand that you feel insecure
I think it would be appropriate to try treating ptsd (or other diagnosis‘ related to your traumatic childhood) first and see which symptoms persist
"If you already have been treated for that and that has helped some symptoms but other adhd related symptoms still persist you can argue that! Have you been open with your doctor about your concerns? Do you feel like she takes you seriously? 

You also can always get a second opinion"
But differential diagnosis is a really important step so you can get the help you need
"Wishing you the best of luck OP, keep us updated! <3"
Some people and some people dont
Mine got worse
To the point where I'm finally seeking help
Ask him what research shows that
"Well.....I'm over 60 and waiting to ""outgrow"" it."
Unfortunately in adults assessing adhd symptoms is essentially a diagnosis by exclusion (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis_of_exclusion) since psychiatric diagnoses are not pathology based
Without being able to test or image to identify a diagnosing lesion or difference it is impossible to say what symptoms are caused by what
If there is something else causing some of the symptoms of ADHD then treating ADHD might not even have that much impact since many of the symptoms might not change if there is still something causing them despite ADHD treatment
"

The take home message should be not that you probably don’t have ADHD"
Your ADHD symptoms shouldn’t be ignored
But you should seek to aggressively treat other things that might also be causing similar symptoms
"

At the very least your history of trauma needs attention"
"

Since ADHD for the most part is going to be with you for a long time then it makes sense to treat and recover from what you can, adapt and compensate where possible, then consider medication with significant possible longer term cardiovascular problems to help with what is left"
"

It is kinder to acknowledge trauma and the fact that there is help that really helps available"
Unfortunately many people with trauma are invalided in many ways
"Their experiences, their emotions, their reactions are often very valid if troubling"
The invalidation can be internalised and people begin invalidating their own feelings and experiences
"For some explaining symptoms and emotions as simply ADHD is alluring, as it seems like something easily fixed with a prescription"
Unfortunately framing too much like this can be a kind of invalidation
"Like “nah, I’m just impulsive and dysregulation because of ADHD, those strong emotions are just a thing to be treated away”"
This kind of approach actually makes emotional dysregulation and impulsivity related to trauma worse
"Control comes from being able to acknowledge, experience, sit with, and contemplate strong emotions or impulses"
Deciding what to do with them then
The strong emotions and impulses may never go away
In a frequently used analogy some people’s internal world is like a placid lake
They can swim and go where they want easily
Some people’s internal world is like a stormy sea
Emotions and impulses rolling over them
"Ignoring or invalidating the waves just leads to drowning, fighting the waves also does….but learning to surf and live with the waves can be great"
"

I would advise ignoring the health care professionals interpretation of the research"
Yes adults often have fewer diagnostic symptoms as they are only diagnostic when they are causing impairment
The beauty of adulthood is being able to learn how to live with symptoms and how to actively adapt your environment to mean symptoms may be less or even not impairing
"

It sounds like the health care professionals interpretation may have only a superficial understanding of ADHD r maybe even psychiatric symptoms to lift itself"
"

There are things though that can be taken away from such a blunt opinion as theirs:
There is trauma, trauma which can be treated, and trauma which can be understood"
Pursue this
Recover and grow where you can
It can always be in parallel to seeking help around ADHD symptoms.
"32 with extreme adhd since I was 13, non medicated because nothing works"
All the drugs have worse side effects then benefits
Life is a struggle.
I am going to level with you
"When it comes to reddit, I don't think this sub is going to give you a consistent and the most accurate answer"
Because research needs interpretation and the vast majority of people interpret things based on their own perception and beliefs
"Also, people tend to look for research that reinforces their own perception and there's lots of research out there that will give one perception or another"
"Edit to add: I find people outside of that expertise tend to be more biased and unaware of the greater research, or be able to critically reflect on that research.

To some degree I would say listen to your doctor that this is the most up to knowledge information that that person has and they are an expert"
"However, if you are unsure, you can seek a second opinion"
Maybe a third but do not go doctor shopping because like with research you will always find a doctor who is got a very different opinion from the vast majority based on again their biases
"

I can speak anecdotally from my own experience which is yeah"
I had to tease about some of the more severe trauma to figure out if ADHD is still there when I don't have that
Sometimes that's hard because you can't undo years of trauma
But I did work very hard and look at where certain symptoms were still present even if the trauma wasn't
"From my conversations and my understanding of somebody who researches diagnosis, trying to tease the part what is causing something is incredibly challenging"
So sometimes people like to treat the bigger issue and see the other issues are still there
"That might be what your Dr is thinking.
 
But you're really good to be reflective in the sense of, Is it important that you have an ADHD diagnosis"
"of course it is if you're struggling and that will help, But you also have to accept that it possibly isn't that issue and seeking that diagnosis for ADHD may prevent you from getting the help that you really need"
So I think you having that perspective is a really good and protective thing to helping you get the best treatment.
If my doctor said that I would have asked for citations then and there and brought them up on PubMed with my phone.
Shiiiiite
I always think
Mine is getting worse
But actually I just think that each day I can't believe how bad it is.
You 100% learn to live with it no doubt
" 

Outgrow is a stretch. 

Honestly depends"
I was fine till i had kids
No
Mine has definitely got worse.
"This is purely anecdotal but some of my symptoms actually decreased as i grow up before i got diagnosed, however some of them also became worse and needed to be medicated."
"Did the doctor mean you die with it? Is that what outgrow means? I'm 44 over here, recently diagnosed & I'm not sure how much more growing I can do with my four decades of untreated extreme ADHD....your doctor *kinda* sounds like an asshole."
"In all fairness, it’s hard to untangle which symptoms are from trauma and which might be from ADHD"
"

That said, the presence of trauma history alongside ADHD symptoms doesn’t rule out ADHD"
"

I would echo the comments about asking for citations and making a deep dive"
"Possibly together with your provider, if they are willing to devote the time and thought"
"

It’s possible your provider has a much shallower understanding of ADHD than of other conditions"
That’s sadly common
"

It’s also possible that they have a valid point"
Or that healing from your trauma would greatly reduce your ADHD symptoms
Or that treating your ADHD would make your trauma symptoms more manageable
Brains are funny
"

Sorry you’re dealing with this, and I hope you can get to a situation where both trauma and ADHD are being treated."
"Research shows that some children diagnosed with ADHD who get early intervention treatment have a significant reduction in symptoms, sometimes so significant that they no longer meet the diagnostic criteria for ADHD"
Which is a good thing
We don't outgrow our ADHD difficulties we develop healthy and unhealthy coping mechanisms and we learn to mask
"I believe that ""research"" shows that we struggle, adapt and change, supress, and mask, NOT that the difficulties vanish"
We have no choice other than to survive in an environment that is not designed for us to flourish.
"""Could you give me some citations please? How recent was this research? Aren't there also studies that show trauma may exacerbate existing ADHD symptoms? They're not mutually exclusive"""
I just learned to mask better the older I get
"I think you just learn to better mask/manage the symptoms, which may be what the research is really pointing to"
"After diagnosis, having a better understanding of yourself gives ample opportunity to be reflective and make minor changes where you feel appropriate"
Ask him to gather it together for you in a binder to read.
“Citation needed.”
as other people have mentioned my very first thought go to a different doctor now immediately stat don’t overthink it
Don’t go back absolutely try a different doctor
"I’m not a medical expert, but I am an expert at dealing with attention disorder and here’s what I can tell you first"
"First of all a lot of trauma in your childhood is one of the most significant indicators of the potential of having to deal with the attention deficit disorder strangely enough a large percentage of people stop dealing with attention deficit disorder have had childhood trauma so somebody in the medical professional saying that because of your medical trauma, they don’t think it’s likely that you have ADHD suggest to me that you should absolutely run away from that person and seek out a more knowledgeable, medical professional ideally somebody who focuses or specializes in attention deficit disorder"
"You can’t afford to waste days weeks months or years on somebody who can’t help you, but can certainly hold you back."
"Citation needed.

Anyways, maybe I am feeling extra sensitive about all this and feeling like it might be a rejection"
"

What she did was recommend me to a psychiatrist that she trusts and then asked me about working together in more sessions of therapy to help with my trauma."
"From what I have read (In journals, not your aunt’s Facebook rants), since ADHD is the result / partly the result of a brain that did not develop properly in the womb, or faced a traumatic event that caused its “wiring” to be “damaged”, if a child receives intervention early, they can be “cured”"
"By taking stimulants and going to therapy (and practicing what is learned in therapy), a child may be able to successfully “re wire” their brain"
Every kid has a malleable brain
And humans are very adaptable
"So while unfortunately kids can be injured or experience trauma, they can heal from it as well"
"As the child turns into a teenager and then a young adult, this becomes much harder until they are an adult, when their brain is done developing"
But a child that dosen’t receive intervention will not simply “snap out of it” upon turning 18
I think the confusion and misinformation is a result of people not taking the time to understand / not caring about this info and cherry picking to confirm their own bias. 
Like any mental illness it doesn't go away
It's chronic and for life
It becomes manageable but will never fully go away
Maybe for intermittent periods but never entirely.
This is what I have felt too
"If I can maintain my ADHD symptoms with drugs, I am least bothered by my past trauma because I have the confidence to live my day to day life like a normal person that I have enough mental energy to spare to work on my past"
"

I often feel bad when a doctor makes me feel like my life is okay"
I am going to a doctor because I am desperate not because I am a hypochondriac or anxious
"I need help, I have reached my limits."
There is research sayings its true for like half of adhd people or something
Just because you dont like it doesnt make it false.
"Those who ""grow out"" were likely misdiagnosed to begin with"
Mine has been opposite
I was diagnosed in my 40s when things just became unmanageable
It just got noticeably worse
I get so tired of hearing about doctors telling you that you aren't experiencing what you are experiencing
They are probably relying on some article they read 20 years ago and call it a day
This is why we now have celebrity TV doctors getting ready to be in charge of America's healthcare.
"This! If I had started taking Vyvanse before addressing my PTSD, I am fairly certain I would be worse off."
This is kind of how I was understanding what the doctor said
"While I wish I had been diagnosed with ADHD in childhood, I didn’t get diagnosed until my forties after I received lots of therapy, gotten treatment for my depression and anxiety, and received specialized therapy for trauma"
"At any point, if a doctor had just thrown stimulants at me and hoped for the best, I can promise I would be an entire mess right now"
There is a lot of overlap between PTSD symptoms and ADHD symptoms
Only after I really dealt with all the trauma was it clear there was something else going on.
"Only after CBT, treatment with antidepressants, and finally image transformation therapy was it obvious my brain wasn’t braining properly"
I’m thankful I was able to heal from my trauma and finally get diagnosed with ADHD
I was in a much better place mentally by the time I got diagnosed and medicated.
Wait
"What kind of doctor is she, then?"
I think it’s more accurate to call adhd a “developmental disorder” than a mental illness
But it does get referred to as a mental illness sometimes
even “developmental disability” fees more accurate
"I know it’s basically just semantics, but calling adhd a mental illness just doesn’t sit right with me"
"adhd is absolutely co-morbid with many mental illnesses, like anxiety disorder, depression, bipolar disorder"
"

What are other people’s thoughts on this? Does it matter? 

Most of all, I feel so angry that a doctor, a psychologist would say that"
"

People with ADHD have brains that are fundamentally different; different structure, different function and different development"
Executive functioning is impaired
"if parts of your brain didn’t develop correctly, or are wired correctly, you can’t just “grow out of it”

That’s ridiculous and so offensive.

Early intervention while the brain is still growing and changing can be so crucial, and help re-wire the brain; finding and strengthening other areas and connections to compensate for any developmental weaknesses"
this can come in the form of CBT and adhd medication in childhood
"

for someone like me; I received no therapy as a child"
No medication
"No real, informed, effective management"
"

As a result, I am an adult plagued and quantifiable disabled by adhd"
"I did not “grow out of it”.

Through cbt and medication I have been able to improve my life"
But I will always have adhd
there will always be struggles I have to face
"No medication is going to cure me, but it can help lighten the load some"
"

You can learn coping strategies"
You can overcome your adhd to a certain extent; by finding success and living  meaningful happy life
But you can’t out grow it
"

you can not outgrow a disability."
I definitely hear you
It's hard when they don't listen or work with you
I have found you have to take control a bit
"Tell them what you want, and if they so much as hedge, fire their ass and move to the next one in network"
"They can't all be shitheads, right?"
I’d love to see the research if you can find it for me :)
Learning to compensate for mild symptoms is not outgrowing
"The underlying issue remains.

I read the study you linked, and their conclusion doesn't disagree with that"
"

Some people don't have it so bad, and they can manage the symptoms by learning some strategies"
"Some people need medication, and then they can handle the symptoms"
"And some people really struggle, even with the meds"
"There is a whole spectrum within ADHD, but even in the best case, your brain doesn't change in structure or ""heal"" ADHD away."
"Or were medicated as children and had the neuroplasticity that allowed their brains to develop more normally (due to being medicated as children).

I can't find the link, but I recall a study indicating that those who were medicated as children underwent brain changes that led to a positive reduction in symptoms even after discontinuing meds.

...doesn't work for those of us diagnosed as adults, though."
"Or just learned coping strategies that were largely stressful and anxiety inducing if not just unhealthy. 


After getting medication the anxiety I didn't realize I had just.."
Went away
I never knew what it was like to not have that low level of anxiety
"The constant worry I'm forgetting something, or knowing stuff i need to do but not being able to focus on it until the last minute and feeling rushed. 


Never feeling a sense of accomplishment"
Rarely being able to focus enough to do hobbies because there is no deadline to panic over
"Feeling stuck. 


Outwardly I was ""fine"""
"I was successful, but inward I felt the struggle."
ADHD burnout is real
Undiagnosed and forced to come up with ways to make it thru not knowing why everything was so hard for us when it wasn't for others is  exhausting
I'm glad you found overdue validation and support!
a psychologist
https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8810708/ Okay according to this it’s more unstable/borderline adhd than anything else
I don’t know how psychology is supposed to deal with this how to differentiate adhd that is not showing right not vs actual non adhd especially since ive also heard that late onset ADHD is a thing.
"In my country, psychologists are not doctors."
I’d highly recommend going with a different doctor as a matter of considerable importance

Any one out there go through A LOT of jobs?

This is my experience only
"

I was in a similar situation"
"I looked for some explanation  for abnormal weight gain/appetite for 15 years, 3 years prior to getting ADHD diagnosis"
I did lose weight but also gained more throughout the years
Multiple doctors ensured me there was no sign of a metabolism disorder with many tests and screenings
" 

Until March this year"
"Long story short, it turns out I have reactive hypoglycemia and an underperforming thyroid with Hashimoto’s.

The issue was that with reactive hypoglycemia, my blood sugar was dropping a bit too much signaling hunger an hour after eating"
So I was in a constant hunger cycle where eating signaled more hunger
I would eat too much after ADHD meds wore off
I am happy to say I’v lost 18 kg / 40 lbs since starting treatment in April
"

We can’t know if you have something similar going on but I wanted to highlight the importance of looking at your health not only within ADHD context.

Hope this helps.

Edits"
Rephrasing for clarity.
"I switched to Vyvanse, another binge eating disorder drug that is also used for ADHD"
It helps and lasted longer for me
"I added a booster in the afternoon as the meds wear off by 2pm, the booster is dexamphetamine"
Another thing I introduced is a rule
No eating until sunset and not eating after 7.30pm
This helps me not binge
But it probably won’t work for everyone
"The fasting helped me stop thinking about food all the time and helped me change my mindset from I am bored, where is the food to I am bored, it isn’t a sign to eat."
I switched to Elvanse for exactly this reason
It makes me full a lot quicker and kind of have a take it or leave it thing with food rather than an obsession.
I ended up having a gastric bypass and being diagnosed with adhd in the same week
I have always struggled with binge eating and emotional eating
I’m still currently waiting for meds but really hoping they come through soon as even though I know I’m not hungry (because of the bypass) I am constantly wanting to graze - mainly crunchy foods
It’s the act of crunching or chewing rather than the food itself
It’s been rather a revelation that it’s considered stimming
"Currently I have sugar free mints, they are hard and strong so I don’t want one after the other and can’t just crunch them in seconds."
I don’t keep snacks in the house
I also ask myself if I would eat an apple right now when I get the urge to eat
"If I wouldn’t eat an apple, I know it is just a craving"
You can also try to stop eating with the tv on and focus on your food as you eat
Focus on thinking of food as fuel instead of comfort.
"I started keeping plain cheerios around to have as a snack instead of crackers/cheese/sweets, etc"
it’s like ~150 calories for a cup and a half
For me I had issues eating for stimulation
"Food is stimulation, textures, taste, the sensation of eating are all very stimulating"
If I find myself eating a lot of snacks now I stop and contemplate why? Did I not eat enough during the day because of my meds and I’m just now finding myself hungry? Then maybe I eat a more substantial snack
I know I often don’t eat enough during the day and then make up the calories with a fourth meal
"But sometimes I am bored, understimulated  or otherwise in need of stimulation"
"In these cases, I try to find another way to get that stimulation"
Sometimes that can be finding an activity to do
Or sometimes it may be grabbing a flavored seltzer water or a hot tea
Or a combo of the two
I basically had to train myself to fully pay attention to hunger cues to better figure out the source of the snacking
Extended release Ritalin.
"I do blood tests regularly, wouldn't that be caught if that was the issue?"
I've always been a bored eater
I rarely felt hungry because I was consistently eating
"And so I've been overweight my whole life.


A couple things have completely changed that:

* Last year I experimented with fasting, to see how long it'd take before I truly felt hungry"
"Turns out, if I'm keeping hydrated, it takes a day or so before the lightest hunger pangs kick in"
And a few days before they become notable
"My longest fast was 10 days, and the most difficult thing was balancing electrolytes — too low = low energy, too high = diarrhea"
"

* Finally getting an ADHD diagnosis"
"Framing the food as a stimming behavior that can be replaced with other stimming behaviors and stimulant meds.


Now I *actually* understand how people can forget to eat during the day"
I'm currently doing a low calorie OMAD.
So I had a lot of “off” values and indicators that were abnormal but not worrying enough on their own
It took an excellent endocrinologist to piece it all together and run further tests to confirm the prognosis
"Such as having disproportionately large abdomen even when underweight since childhood, thyroid hormones being too close to upper thresholds, a glucose tolerance test with one value out of normal range, my self-reporting of how I experience hunger, detailed blood and hormone panels"
You know how ADHD flies under the radar sometimes resulting in a late diagnosis? It felt exactly like that where I knew something was off but couldn’t get an explanation for it for so long.
"Yeah, I was a daily grazer, like some chocolate addicted gazelle"
Just putting food in my mouth absentmindedly
"

Since fasting combined with meds and walking 15k+ steps a day, I don’t feel any need to binge eat anymore nor do I crave carbonated drinks or sweet treats"
"

And when I do, I eat a few clementines or an apple which also since fasting have become so sweet and delicious to me."
Could you share what type of treatment you are undergoing? I have the same problem.
Thyroid medication first thing in the morning to keep my Thyroid Stimulating Hormone in check
 I’m lucky as the lowest dose suffices
"Diet changes, avoiding refined stuff or food/drinks that cause blood sugar spikes"
I’m temporarily on diabetes type 2 medication to help shed the weight
(I was clinically obese but nearing normal weight now.)
"For Hashimoto’s, there isn’t a cure really"
It’s an autoimmune disease that can increase in severity
"I try to prevent it from advancing by dietary changes, thyroid medication and losing weight."

"I’ve always been a social person, but medication has made me hate drunk people"

Try exercise before or during the meds
It's like taking a pre-workout and than working out way after it loses its efficacy
Can confirm swimming on meds I can easily push % longer than before after or without them
Meds in themselves are a workout for the heart.
I used to workout when my adderall IR was peaking
Best workouts ever! I’m on Vyvanse now
Not the same effect but it doesn’t impede my workout
Sounds like your workouts are timed when your meds are in decline.

"Put a cup of sweet coffee, or a redbull, or the stimulant of your choice, on your bedside table"
Set an alarm for 45 minutes before you need to get up
Set another alarm for when you need to get up
"When the first alarm goes off, down the stimulant and go back to sleep! Fuck time and wakefulness and work! When the second alarm goes off, waking up will seem like a more reasonable thing to do and less of an existential crisis"
"Honestly, set up something you love to do and give yourself permission to do it right when you wake up"
"For me, delicious breakfast gets me up"
"Could be a game, a bath, play time with your dog… whatever you look forward to, set it up so you do it right when you’re meant to wake up.

If your morning is all tooth brushing and chores you’ll never want to get it started."
You got this! The alarm needs to force you out of bed
Clothes ready to be put on
"

Get dressed straight away and only then you can go wash your face and teeth(if you feel resistance, skip this step!:)

Have your coffee + chocolate or whatever poison you choose in the mornings READY to go and enjoy"
"Look at your phone, at this point something will awake your brain"
"

last but not least: Make 100% sure you’re sleeping your hours."
"If you take meds, set an alarm an hour before your regular one, take your med and go back to sleep"
"Hopefully you won't be able to fall back asleep after your normal alarm because they kicked in.

Put your alarm out of reach so you have to get out of bed to turn it off"
"Don't get back in the bed.

Never don't set an alarm"
Snooze it instead of turning it off if youre going to go back to sleep anyway.
Put your next day’s clothes out the night before and  place your keys and backpack or whatever you take with you by the front door
Get ready in advance as much as you can
"

Get into bed an hour before you usually do"
"

Set your alarm"
No snooze button pressing
"

Once you get out of bed, you’re halfway there !"
"Automatic lighting, I have fairy lights connected to a timer to turn them on in the morning and evening, helps because if the light is already on when I wake up it's not as harsh of a transition and in the evening I can turn off all other lights and wait for my fairy lights to turn off on their own as a signal to sleep.

not setting my alarms too early helps,  because if I give myself time I will spend that time and more procrastinating 

and an alarm sound that doesn't need to be turned off, mine plays radio, if you're using a phone alarm you can set it to play a Spotify playlist, doesn't work for me because I tend to silence all phone alarms as soon as they start sounding without even realising what Im doing, but it might work for you."
"Set a lamp on a $10 timer and have it turn on, on the other side of the room"
I wake up earlier than I need to
"I shower, do my dishes, make my bed, get dressed etc"
then i take my meds and drink my coffee slowly while doing an enjoyable/stimulating task
I usually do this for 40-45 min before leaving to work
"This gets me out of bed every morning because I enjoy this routine before work, and I look forward to doing it!"
"I planned my waking up routine like this: wake up, leagues of legend/WOW, breakfast, school/work"

"The majority of the time, i.e"
"excepting narcolepsy, being tired in the morning is about when you go to sleep and the quality of that sleep"
"First port of call is the former, just because it's cheaper to sort out"
"If you have good sleep hygiene, and a good routine, and you still can't get out of bed in the morning, go get a sleep study done"
Sleep issues are a massive cause of executive function problems
Ask any parents of a newborn.
I've been struggling with this for weeks now..maybe even going on months
I had to get a note from my doctor and I still don't really know if that's going to cover me as far as not getting fired goes
"I would also appreciate tips for just getting out of bed, even when it feels like my brain and body won't let me."
You’re going to need to reset your circadian rhythm and improve your sleep hygiene
"There’s plenty written on the topic, so I won’t go into detail here"
"However, one thing that really helped me with waking up is setting my alarm to play music instead of a jarring sound"
"For me, Motown works best—it’s a great way to start the day!"
Folks with ADHD often need more sleep because their brains going all the time makes them tired
Have you tried to figure out when you wake naturally? Or tried 9 hours of sleep each night for a couple of weeks or so?
"Set multiple alarms, and alarms for those alarms"
"

It took me years to realize I could simply set multiple alarms for the same thing and it was life changing."
Maybe try putting an alarm clock in another room to force yourself to get out of bed
Turn on a bunch of lights and set a routine that doesn't have you going right back into your bedroom.
"Immediately after I wake up, I watch reels or youtube for ten minutes"
"Like right after I open my eyes, the first thing I do is open Instagram"
That activates my mind enough for me to get off the bed and grab my toothbrush
Then I can turn off the reels and brush peacefully
I also found that setting up two alarms 20 and 40 minutes before the actual alarm sort of helps
"Finally, try to wake up anticipating something"
Like a delicious breakfast or wearing your favourite outfit
Something you really look forward to.
Game changer for me was getting one of those lights that slowly turns on to full brightness - that along with my actually alarms has really helped me with mornings and I’ve struggled with mornings my whole life
They’re fairly inexpensive and available on Amazon
I think the most obvious solution is to set multiple alarms
This way you will wake up two minutes later
"Also, put the phone away from the bed so that you have to get up to turn the alarms off"
"You could choose different alarms each time and one that is loud and more blaring for the last minute when you have no choice left and you simply have to get up.

I literally set like 8 alarms or even more sometimes and often earlier than I truly need to get up to allow more sleepy snooze time"
Very common with ADHDers to have many alarms
"You could also have normal phone alarms, but as a backup a manual alarm for the emergency I fucking HAVE to get up now"
"Also alarms potentially to say I have to leave.

I agree with other commenters"
Your job is really important most likely
Significantly more sleep will really help
"

Good luck!"
Open your eyes
If you take stimulant meds you can do this with those instead of red bull....also keep in mind though if you're chronically sleep deprived this is a terrible idea
"You can only push your body so much.

Also OP start using an emergency alarm, it's your last resort"
"If that alarm goes off shit has hit the fan, get up and move! Mine's an air raid siren sound, my partners sounds like every alarm sound all at once lol."
Same here!
This is very convenient for me because I love sleep!
I used to play Proud Mary - starts slow and quiet then gets real fun and energetic.
thanks
I can sleep through it
Removed it cuz my gf doesnt need to go through that just for me to sleep like a lamb with a smile on my face through it
"Yeah, I have a “sunrise alarm” that is basically a light that mimics the sun coming up"
I set it for 5 min after my actual alarm
"It’s still gentle (the light comes on very slowly) so my boyfriend doesn’t get affected and it’s my “oh shit” alarm that I only set when something early and important is happening (like work for example).

Alternatively, I work for myself now and make my own schedule"
That’s been a huge help too
"But until you can do that, setting an extra alarm (or having more than one) is great."
All jokes aside
Exercise will fix your sleeping problem.

I have the same problem!!! This semester I started working ahead on my assignments by trying to schedule homework times and viewing those times as deadlines for the assignments instead of the actual deadline
For example if I had an assignment actually due this Sunday I would make it “due” for me on Friday
"

Another thing I do that isn’t necessarily good is I do homework during class times if I know I’m having a day that I won’t pay attention fully to the lecture"
"

To make sure I stay productive during my homework time I make sure my room is clean and I’ve eaten already and went to the gym or whatever else I like to do each day that I might use to procrastinate"
I’ll also put on a podcast of dj set from a dj I like on my tv or headphones

"For me, depression symptoms can fluctuate but I have ADHD symptoms even when I’m feeling pretty happy/content."
"I think the label and differentiation may be less important than you think, which makes what I'm about to share a little weird"
"I found learning that I have ADHD really helped my depression symptoms, because it turned out I was being mean to myself a million times a day for things that were not my fault"
"But I do think they are distinct. 


I'm trying not to info dump, so if you are interested in any of what I'm about to try to lightly touch on, I'm happy to share more thoughts either here or in the DMs"
"I've thought about this topic a metric shït-ton.


I think a common symptom people with ADHD experience is periods of high activity followed by collapse, an expand and collapse system, if you will"
"I think many of us tend to miss signs that we're overwhelming ourselves, and our nervous system has a snapping effect from that, pulling us into a depressive state to try to get us to chill out.."
But going overboard
It's possible this is what you're experiencing
It's possible it's something else and you need different intervention
"My experience with the medication I've been taking is that when I'm on it, my emotional regulation is vastly improved, and it's helped me identify things I was unaware of in my patterns"
I struggle with RSD and feelings of worthlessness
"The meds help, but the feelings are always waiting for me to tend to them later. 


Cultivating sensitivity to the layers of your emotional body is a challenging process"
I've learned a lot through Somatic Experiencing therapy and EMDR for PTSD
"Starting to see what is caused by my ADHD versus my old thought patterns (the two really play together to make a horrendous agony baby) has been massively helpful for me. 


If none of this is helpful to you, I wish you the best luck in finding something to feel better"
You don't deserve to feel worthless
You deserve to know to your very bones that you are worthy of being.
"My own depression was caused by my untreated ADHD-PI, and medication (while not a silver bullet) has helped immensely"
"Unlike myself, it's entirely possible to have ADHD and clinical depression as two separate/adjacent issues, so if ADHD medication isn't covering those bases, then seek additional treatment for the persisting depression"
You don't deserve to feel that way and improvements are very possible.
"Depression comes in episodes, usually with full recovery in between"
An average length of time for an untreated depressive episode is 6 months
ADHD symptoms are there all the time
"

There are mood regulation problems which are there all the time too but they aren’t depression"
When traits are stable and part of someone’s general way of coping or feeling or interacting we call them personality traits
Personality traits tend to stabilise in adolescence and remain fairly stable throughout adult life
When personality traits cause problems they aren’t known as personality disorders
Many people mistake certain personality related issues for depression as the traits might include things like low mood problems and thoughts of not being alive
Many people mistake neurodevelopmental problems like ADHD for personality related difficulties but since ADHD is neurodevelopmental the traits are present right from the start of life basically (though when super young like a baby attention and hyperactivity symptoms can’t really be seen since they can’t pay attention anyway)
"

You might be able to tell things apart by looking at the long term pattern to the traits"
Things associated with depression will be absent for most of your life and may only have even stared in your 20s
Personality related things probably became an issue in teenage years and thereafter are kinda there the whole time
ADHD things will have been present as long as you remember
My psychiatrist say adhd medication isn’t enough if you’ve depression
If you have depression you need to treat the depression before you get full benefit of adhd treatment
"True, but there also are chronic depressions or manic-depression"
"It’s a mental illness which can come in different forms, durations and how heavy they are"
Also it can come as a symptom OR an illness/disorder (it’s really complex).
"for me, i had been diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) since i was a teenager"
"i started prozac during lockdown and it helped with my depression symptoms (disinterest in things, the kinds of SI thoughts you mentioned, etc.) but i still struggled with executive dysfunction (time blindness, decision paralysis, issues with concentration/completing tasks, hyperactive thoughts).

i was late diagnosed and, for me, that was the confirmation that i wasn’t just dealing with one or the other"
"when i started vyvanse + prozac, that’s when i saw the difference that people were talking about"
"maybe talking to your provider about adding something might be helpful? 

it seems pretty common that people who have been late diagnosed have struggled with depression/anxiety as a result"
hope this helps ♥️
This is how I’ve been feeling
"So depression isn’t a constant thing? I thought these feelings weren’t consistent, but they kept recurring"
"My executive dysfunction (caused by ADHD) feels linear, but my depressive symptoms don’t seem to follow that pattern"
It’s interesting to realize this.
That’s interesting
"But what if you developed the depression directly and more indirectly BECAUSE of your ADHD? I’m not sure, but in that case treating the symptoms of ADHD (which ADHD-medication can do for a part, within 1 hour."
"in contrast to antidepressants) sound more effective to me, than start the treatment with antidepressants/therapy while your ADHD-symptoms still keep existing and the main source of your depression will stay"
"Like when long time domestic abuse/violence is causing the depression, and you don’t start solve those first (by taking care to get a safe place)"
"

ADHD-symptoms first, OR maybe treath ADHD-symptoms and depression together sounds like more sense? (For me, but I didn’t study it for 10 years)

Your therapist of course knows what he does, but I’m just curious: may I ask if your depression is ADHD-caused/related?"
"No, with ADHD you are sensitive for mood swings (sometimes within an hour or part of the day)"
"How much or how heavy is different from person to person, that depends on more things, like how stable your personality and environment is"
"Executive dysfunction isn’t really linear i think, because you can do ‘miracles’ when you are interested or even hyperfocused (which is the opposite of executive dysfunction)"
"Also the executive dysfunction can vary in heaviness from day to day when you didn’t sleep well, have no routine (with external help) or your current life situation for example"
And of course it’s partly treatable with medicines for a lot of people.
Not exactly
But it all varies from person to person
"

I didn’t mean depression fluctuates for me on a daily basis"
I meant in a much more long term sense
"For over 2 decades when I was diagnosed with depression but not ADHD, I had periods of happiness"
"But even during those periods, I still had all my ADHD symptoms"
"Being happy didn’t help me get my work done, clean my house, get through my lists"
"

My ADHD is with me regardless of my depression"
"

I still have depression, but for me it is strongly affected by external circumstances"
My ADHD isn’t
"External assistance can help me function or make my functioning worse, but the ADHD challenges are always there for me"
 I never feel I don’t have ADHD or that it isn’t structuring my experience or behavior
Not ever
Not for one minute of any day
"

With depression, I do have times when it isn’t structuring my experience, feelings, and behavior."

I got one of those criss cross chairs off Amazon
I’m not sure if this would help you based on how you like to sit  but it helped me with sitting more comfortably since there’s more room on the actual seat
I usually sit cross cross so this lets me sit more evenly since there’s enough room for my legs
I’ll also sometimes put a big pillow against the side of my bed and sit on the floor with a few blankets.
"Not really anything for an ADHD forum, but I'm guessing your desk height is wrong and you might do better with a different posture chair."

"Oh my friend, I'm in knots of agitation for you"
The sympathy is real
"I'm so super sorry you're dealing with so much friction in your job. 


You say you can't confront her, but can you just talk to her? Totally fine if you can't, but I find generally (not always) a friendly ""hey, can I pick your brain about our working styles for a minute? I could really use your help to figure some things out"" is well received"
"Sometimes everything gets a million times better, sometimes only a little, sometimes nothing changes, but it's never gotten worse"
"It's all about treating it as mutual problem solving (I suggest reading Getting to Yes for a really great primer on negotiations and business relationships) where you want everyone to come out feeling like a winner. 


Absent that, how do you accept your situation without letting it slowly erode your will to live? Not easily"

Literally story of my entire life when I was unmedicated
"I was constantly functioning at 1,000% trying to keep up with everyone’s normal so I was basically constantly burned out"
"Once I started stimulants it got a lot better because I wasn’t working on constant overdrive anymore, but if I don’t take my stimulants I can still easily sleep the day away"
"Part of that (for me) also has to do with being the inattentive type, with anxiety and depression so when I don’t take my stimulants my brain becomes almost paralyzed by the idea of what to do so going to sleep/doing nothing seems like the easiest and most comforting option"
My doc just tells me to take my stimulants everyday anyway (working or not) - this helps me avoid sleeping the day away
"

If I am in a deep depression though I’m pretty much exhausted all the time even if I take stimulants"
Personally anti-depressants didn’t fix the sleeping problem for me when I was experiencing a deep depression - all they do is make me numb so I don’t even care if I sleep or about anything at all really haha (I don’t take them anymore bc of that among other bad side effects I have)
"

So I think your thought process on what you are experiencing is entirely in the realm of something possible"
Discuss it with your doctor to try and address.
Tldr: you and your body need down time
"Give yourself permission to intentionally flop.


I've learned that at least one day of my weekend needs to be a minimum of 80% flop and decompression.


If I've been doing well, that decompression time is pretty positive; I'm awake and chilling with coffee and a book (or just sitting in sunlight), enjoying existing"
"If I miss that decompression time too many weeks in a row, my body just starts shutting down when an opportunity presents itself and a quick rest becomes a 2 hour nap.


Today is my decompression day, but due to increased pressure during the past weeks and not being able to decompress last weekend, I slept for almost 12 hours today."
My doc once explained to me that a likely reason ADHD brains are so exhausted after work is because of the overwhelming level of executive function usage at work and then there’s none leftover once home
Sort of along the lines of high stimulation at work and then there’s none leftover for the drive home so you crank the music just to make the drive.
"Isn't nursing famous for being hard work? I am a chef, and I do this from time to time, but also have adhd.


But new guy at work just came back off his day off and regaled us with the tale of how he spend all day sleeping, and he isn't adhd"
"He did work his little cotton socks off though.


Does adhd make your life even more work, and make this more likely to happen? Maybe, idk"
"But, I don't think you should feel guilt for rest, it's probably well earned."
I have done this occasionally
"Crazy long sleeps of 19 hours, waking in the middle then going straight back to bed to sleep more"
"I only got diagnosed a couple of weeks ago, so in hindsight I think it was my brain going crazy"
Sleep is my go to for time out because whatever I do to try to relax doesn't work
"Sleep is also manic, but it's better than anything else I've tried"
"If your body needs it, and you can do it, do it."
I’m a teacher and I think this is not uncommon in the caring professions
I sometimes will need a day where I don’t stand up (pregnant right now and I have had many Saturdays like that).
" I can’t say for sure because I’m not professional but I do this too sometimes! I can go to bed at 10PM and wake up the next day at 1PM, feeling out of this world and tired"
Go to use the toilet and eat/drink something maybe and then go back to bed to ‘wake up better’ > fall asleep around 2-3PM and wake up next morning around 7-9AM
That night I can go to bed normally at 10PM and sleep well (sometimes the fay might include 2-3 hours long nap).
I have deep shame of sleeping a lot too
I think from my childhood
But I think my body really does need that rest
"As long as I wake up feeling emotionally calm and grounded, it was a good thing"
And I remind myself to not feel guilty for taking something i desperately need and deserve
"

If / When I wake up feeling even more tired though, then it’s a sign I’ve slept too much and I should go for a walk in sunlight."
Guilty
As charged.
"My weekend, im a teacher"
I love this secret shame! Please do more of it
"You work hard, you need to rest, perfectly normal once in a while."
Are you an RN? Do you work 12 hour shifts? I worked 8 hour shifts ( I retired 10+ years ago) 
After working a couple of days in a row I could easily go to bed  at 02:00 get up at 11:00 or noon
Eat and then take a little 3 hour nap and go to bed at 23:00
Nurses walk 7 to 9 miles in a 8 hr shift and up to 10 or 11 miles in 12 hour shift
It’s not just physical
Your mind is always busy too.
"Ohhhh, honestly sounds amazing"
"I'd love to just catch-up like that.  


My body needs to do that, but won't relax enough"
"Still unmedicated, using stress as self-medication to do stuff. 


In other words, get some sissors & cut yourself some slack"
You deserve it. 
I need a day over the weekend to rest and do nothing
"If I don't, I can't make it in the coming week"
"The constant pressure and stress is exhausting if you keep it up, and having to mask my symptoms on top of that takes everything out of me."
"I sleep a lot…the bad thing about is I work 45-50 hours a week, and sometimes all I want to do is sleep, which means I have less time to do the things I already struggle to get done"
"It sucks, really"
I feel like all I do is work and sleep
Notice I didn’t even include eating
You are not alone.
"I think this that sounds like a perfect day!! 
I'm sorry op, I'm not addressing that you're feeling bad about a day like this.

Our brains do work harder, and you being a nurse with the super long shifts you work, I'd say you earned every single moment of a day like that. 
That's my take"
"I'm tired today, and I may take a day like this for myselg today.

Wishing you well op"
🦋
"> if it’s some rebound effect from taking a day off my stimulant 

This"
"For me, the first day I don’t take meds I’m basically a zombie"
Usually by mid day 2 I’m back to my normal unmedicated chaos
But this is why I don’t do “break days” anymore.
"Yes I’ll waste totally waste a day but on a side note… my adhd daughter is in her first year of college for nursing and is really struggling studying, time management and test taking"
At least I know there are adhd nurses out there
"Oh, no, my body does this"
I feel like sometimes I push it and it needs a day to rest and regulate
I have chronic illness too
"Ain't feeling guilty for that shit, get your rest, girl."
My sister and best friend say my life is just one long string of naps
I specifically picked a job that would allow me to work 4 days a week so I'd have one day to sleep
I haven't needed it as much since I switched to taking my allergy pill at night before bed
I actually get close to 8 hours now
I don't think it's abnormal at all
And probably not just for people with ADHD
It's probably normal for anyone who doesn't get much sleep for any reason.
"Are you a newish nurse? Your brain is working overtime learning all the things for at least the first 2 years, plus the work itself is very mentally draining"
For me it's worth the trade off of not getting bored and always staying engaged
"But yes, it's normal to need ALOT of recovery time"
"Also, quite normal to be EXTRA tired when taking a day off from stimulants"
I only skip days when I'm sick
"Then again, I can still easily rest/nap on stims-maybe that's not the case for you."
Yeah I do similar
"I think there’s something about the extra alertness I need to apply just to get through a regular day that compounds, and then requires days of catch up sleep"
"It’s not a lifestyle that dovetails well with the demands of the modern economy! Lolz, but also a big problem."
I work in healthcare and I have this same problem
I work 12 hour shifts and I have to mask the entire time and try to stay hypefocused on task
By the time I get a day off I sleep on and off for two days straight and then the cycle continues
Reading this when I've just woken up to feed the cat and then got straight back into bed because my body is sore and my heart hurts after a 7 day stretch at work..
"😂 Yeah, I don't think this is abnormal for ppl with ADHD"
I work in a hospital lab and regularly schedule vacation days just to rest
It's physically and mentally taxing work
"Your body is tired for a reason, that rest is valuable recovery time.


Honestly, the breakfast, coffee and walk part is already very productive in my books"
You're taking care of yourself and relaxing
My first day off is always like that too
"Are you medicated? Before medication I was so mentally & physically burnt out I would get home and stand there trying to force myself to wash dishes, realize I needed a nap, and have to sleep 2-4 hrs every few evenings just to be able to cook dinner later."
Just sleep with no shame
This is called self care.
I need a 90 min nap at the end of a busy brain day.
I schedule sleep days
"I work 4 days a week, sleep one if I have to and catch up on weekend stuff the other two"
I’m not medicated for many reasons
I don’t know if it’s healthy but it works for me.
Hello! I’m a nurse as well
It’s very likely it’s just fatigue from nursing plus the rebound of not taking your meds
"That being said, I had Narcolepsy type 2 for 10yrs without knowing it (since nursing school!) before a doc suggested I might have a sleeping disorder"
"I knew I would get sleepy, but didn’t randomly fall asleep so I had no idea how I felt was so abnormal"
It can be easy to dismiss some of the more subtle symptoms if a person always has a reason to explain their sleepiness.
Today is a day off
I want to be as productive in my personal life as I am in my professional one
But all my brain wants to do is rest
Laziness doesn’t exist
But I need to figure out how to give myself what I need to keep up with my goals and consistency.
There’s growing evidence that ADHD is co-morbid with uneven REM cycles
"As a cherry on top, REM sleep disfunction is strongly associated with Parkinson’s.

My personal anecdote, I have always been the lightest sleeper"
"But yes, I will run dry eventually and sleep like 12 hours and wake up just to go sleep another 12 right away"
I have ADHD and a high stress job as well
And my mother has Parkinson’s.
Do you work nights? Cause this is how a lot of us are on nights
i take meds 24x7 religiously and consistently—if i don’t i can easily sleep all day
I got home last night and was in bed asleep by 1130
I slept until 2pm when my work alarm went off
I woke up several times and every time rolled over and went back to bliss.
Hell I am medicated and sleep A LOT
I share so much of this.
I discussed this with my psychiatrist
I go through what you’re describing in cyclical patterns
Turns out I might be bipolar
"She has started me on lamotrigine, which kind of blocks the extremes"
"It might be placebo, because it’s supposed to take a while for it to work, but I already feel better."
"This! Give yourself permission to intention flop! Nursing uses all your brain cells, stims stimulates your nursy brain"
You NEED a day off to give your body and mind a break
"If it gets to the point where you are emotionally unwell on these days, then just don’t take stim days off, and if you do take days off, just be prepared to sleeeeeeepp."
"I have learned to just say no to doing things with other people on Sundays, lol."
"The reason ADHD brains are so exhausted is that the hyperactivity is in our brains…we are hyperactive internally…overthinking, racing thoughts, basically ceaseless mental activity"
I’ve read that ADHDers hold a minimum of 3 streaming thoughts in our heads
My brain is full of more than 3
This is why we can’t sleep…we can’t turn it off
"OMG having a nap just to have enough energy to cook dinner, that’s so me"
"I have been to many doctors in my lifetime and I am confident I am not bi-polar, depression doesn’t happen in patterns for me"
"I don’t experience both extremes, only depression but it doesn’t happen regularly either"
The worst episodes have been triggered by very bad life events which leave me in an awful state of mind with no sense of self worth
"I did deal with depression more often before medicating adhd because I felt I couldn’t keep up with everyone and I had no idea why - it was a pretty isolating feeling overall but once I began addressing, medicating and understanding my adhd diagnoses, a real depression episode has been a pretty rare occurrence.

But experiencing this tiredness I experience is not uncommon for adhd, many doctors have validated that for me"
"

But I am glad you found what works for you though."
I’ve been on lamotrigine for about two years and it’s definitely helped with the extremes
"Yes, it's a good thing to remember"
We are hyperactive internally

"I have inattentive type so wasn't diagnosed until my 30s, I always say that the stereotype is a little boy running around screaming, but for me it's more like 5 little boys running around my head screaming different unhelpful things when I'm trying to concentrate."

My coworker despised my adhd and decided to mess with my roster and try cost me $500.

You don’t f*** with my money.

So I made her quit and now I’m the manager"
"Been trialling a system to better remember peoples names — and it's working pretty well (mixture of memory palace and physical association).

I met a bunch of new people last weekend while visiting a friend and playing in a local golf clup comp"
"I can remember all of those I met (12 people) today.

This is big for me"
"Usually if I really try I can remember some, but now.."
I'm slowly building a solid system to cope with my inability to remember anyone's names (sometimes even those very close to me who I've known for decades - object impermanence i guess?).

"How much do you take?

I’m on 40mg methylphenidate twice a day, so 80mg in total, but it feels like it doesn’t do that much for me"
"

I want to try another type of adhd medication"
My psychiatrist say my lack of effect my be due to depression.
Thank you for posting this because I’m going through something similar w/ 20mg Adderall
I don’t experience the self harm thoughts and I think that’s the clear differentiator for you — it sounds serious
" My therapist thinks it’s turbulence from setting boundaries, gaining clarity and taking action in harmful relationships but it’s starting to feel like a mini identity crisis"
"

 I’m taking action about two relationships that were harmful before Adderall, but it still hurts to hear when a toxic person says “you’ve been different since starting Adderall”"
"Like, I had way too much patience without Adderall and was a doormat, but now I don’t know if I’m putting up a wall."
"Those are not the standard side effects, and you are right to be concerned"
"See your doctor about a different medication or lowering your dose - think of stimulant effectiveness like a hill-shaped curve, where at some point adding more is not raising your functioning but actually lowering it"
"For example in my case, at 20mg Ritalin LA waking up got easier, at 30mg switching tasks got easier, and at 40mg I was jittery and felt compelled to procrastinate"
So my psychiatrist and I walked my dose back down to 30mg.
80mg is a lot
I think it's even the upper recommended prescibable limit for mph
On any other meds?

"I mean, I see what they mean, but considering ADHD is just how your brain works and your personality is determined by your brain...I don't think it's possible to say it amplifies your personality traits? It's just part of our personality.

People with ADHD generally appearing to have more pronounced personality traits than people without ADHD I can see though."
Your first and second paragraph contradict each other
No
"The thing is, none of us can tell what we would be like without ADHD"
"I can't compare you with ADHD to you without ADHD, so I can't say ""yeah, their personality seems super pronounced due to their ADHD"", that would be weird"
"It doesn't work if we look at an individual.

However, I could see that *maybe* of we compared the whole population, we could say that people with ADHD *appeared* to have more extreme personalities, because of issues with emotional regulation or impulsivity or whatever, compared to people without ADHD."
Maybe
"

What I've noticed is people I think have adhd (they haven't told me but they display characteristics of forgetfullness, not paying attention, etc.) hage a persoanlity that's extremely abc or xyz.

Some of them you could say ""they're a character."" And some women I know who I suspect have it are *super* friendly and/or seem to have a *super* innocent personality"

A few tips! If you need to be productive get dressed first
"Yes, it does sound silly, but getting dressed shoes and all really helps prevent being able to climb into bed instead of doing tasks"
"Second, as soon as you notice yourself think “I don’t want to do this” or “I’ll do it later” immediately stop what you are doing/thinking and physically start the task"
"I hate doing laundry, HATE it"
Instead of thinking how much I hate I shove that thought away and force myself to throw stuff in the wash
"If you have something technology related to do like homework, have a location that isn’t your bed and isn’t comfortable for all day sitting"
I have a desktop computer and it’s been very helpful in preventing bed rotting
"Third, make existing tasks/chores easier"
Set up a no fold system for laundry
If phone calls are overwhelming add frequently called numbers to your favorites
I have my pharmacy saved and city transit
"Change your way of life to mold around your adhd, don’t try to mold your adhd around how you think things should be done."
"Thank you! These are all very helpful!! I’ve never thought to get all the way dressed so I don’t get back in bed, I will say tho getting out of bed to be able to do that to begin with seems hard enough"
"I’ll definitely try implement making the chores easier, most of the battle for me is thinking how long or tedious it would be along with all the other “more important” things I have to do, getting overwhelmed and ending up doing none at all."
"""  Change your way of life to mold around your adhd, don’t try to mold your adhd around how you think things should be done.""


I love this quote with all the cockles of my heart. 


I make my bed first thing after getting up, so similar to getting dressed"
"Once my bed is tidy, I just feel a little better about the day. 


I'm a huge fan of creating aspirational daily to do's, but I limit them severely - no more than 5 items (except in circumstances that demand more)"
"I agree with the ""think it, do it"" philosophy, too"
"For me, writing down things I need to do and spreading them out over days reduces overwhelm, perseveration, and forgetfulness"
"I also find that I want to knock my tasks out early so I can do other stuff, even if it's just reading on the couch, for the rest of the day."

"Why do you think it’s giving in? Do you think you’re a hero for refusing medication? Therapy doesn’t fix adhd any more than it would fix a missing limb, my friend.

Therapy can be very important for survival though - I’d believe the people who try to make me feel hopeless if I didn’t have a therapist"
But it has to be a therapist who knows a lot about adhd
Mine has it herself
"We all need to heal from the emotional abuse and bullying and shaming and internalized self-loathing we’ve been taught, especially if that keeps getting reinforced by toxic people holding your career hostage"
"

I’m not sure what you mean by usual"
"It’s 💯 usual to be screwed over by micromanagers - they only care about having their own way, and do not care about the quality you produce following your own organic process"
"You have my empathy! There’s no forgiveness for micro aggressions, aggressive-aggressions and gaslighting at work"
"When I doubt myself, I picture them killing their own children and lighting themselves on fire as a test"
"if it feels natural or right, then it means your spider sense has picked up on their toxic nature and it is in fact them, not you"
"I got that visualization from a therapist, fwiw."
"I’m just scared of meds that’s all.
Thank you for that"
"Yes, the therapy didnt help"
"I quit but maybe should try until I get one who might help.
And I will definitely imagine the boss lighting themselves on fire and killing their kid"
I like that
😂
"It works for us! When you test it with someone who’s acting like that but is actually a good person under it, it feels wrong so you know it’s not their ego or character to destroy people and burn your world if they don’t get their way"
"If it feels wrong, they are someone you can talk with as equals and trust they act in good faith.

Everyone says healthy workplace means team members use their strengths and fill the gaps in one another’s skills"
"But so many will just take without giving, idk what to do either"
"I willingly spend hours covering others butts, rewriting their work, enjoy using hypefocus to do things they find overwhelming or dull but people who don’t have time blindness don’t step up to help me to do my timesheet, the only thing the boss cares about"
I’ll rant with you ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry)

I've always loved driving but I strongly prefer a manual transmission
"Keeps me in the zone.
Also by driving I mean a reasonably open road, not a traffic jam"
Those are stressful.
Complete opposite for me
Makes me fall asleep
I can’t drive longer than an hour before I feel like I can’t stay awake anymore
Meds have helped a lot in that area though
I can’t drive without music and usually I have to sing along to concentrate
"It stresses me
Out and I absolutely hate it"
"
That said, when I was in Alaska I really enjoyed driving on the wide quiet roads with polite drivers"
Maybe you live somewhere with quiet roads?
Yeah I love driving
"I keep thinking about quitting my job to drive, but my car is a piece of shit so I can't do uber / lyft"
And driving a big truck sounds really stressful.
Only if I'm going straight at 70mph on the freeway and no one else is on the road
So maybe 5% of the time when I unintentionally choose to drive at 3am
No
It’s very stressful
I’m very aware of how distractible I am.
I do
I almost wonder if it’s because you have to be decently good at multitasking 😂
I drove Uber full time in LA from 2013 to the pandemic
"Other than not making much money, I found it to be very enjoyable, kind of like being in a real life video game"
"With real life consequences.
Over 20,000 trips
Never had an accident.
Totally attribute that to my ADHD!"
"If there isn't anyone on the road and I'm just going down good 'ol country roads? Hell yeah.

  
There is a moderate amount of cars cause my dumb ass forgot what time all the city people leave work? Not therapeutic at all I am more stressed than I need to be"
Thems a drinking day.
I take random road trips for the heck of it
"Like, hundreds of miles and multiple hours"
I’d much rather drive cross-country than fly
It’s my personal bubble where I can just be present
"

I hate rush hour traffic and I hate commuting traffic if I have to be somewhere"
That’s stressful to me
But if there’s no actual deadline and I can go at my own pace? Perfectly happy.
"Real life driving in the country, yes"
"In a busy city or heavy traffic, no"
I find it overstimulating and anxiety inducing because I don't trust other people to drive safely.
I totally get this
"Driving is soothing for me too, especially night driving"
I’ve always wanted to be a truck driver or delivery driver of some sort. 
"If there isn't anyone on the road and I'm just going down good 'ol country roads? Hell yeah.

  
There is a moderate amount of cars cause my dumb ass forgot what time all the city people leave work? Not therapeutic at all I am more stressed than I need to be"
Thems a drinking day.
"I hate with all my cells, i get upset, hatefull, zero tolerance hahaha."
I am the complete opposite
I find it agonizing
"If I could get anywhere only using a bike or public transit, I would never drive again."
I'm a local truck driver as well and love my job
I also autocross my personal car in my free time
I'm conflicted about this
"I hate cars, but I do enjoy act of driving."
i just started driving lessons and i'm having a horrible time getting overstimulated and zoning out 😭 i really hope it gets better though
i want to like driving
"I love driving, but I’m prone to miss stop signs, and sometimes run red light if there are no cars stopped in front of me"
"Not a big risk while I was in the US, because I otherwise have decent spatial awareness and don’t speed or do anything risky, but in UAE where there are cameras everywhere I would lose my driving license if that happened so I’m more anxious now"
Luckily I’m in the clear so far.
"Yes! Only on empty high roads, music, preferably night"
"Otherwise, it over stimulating/overwheling hell"
Its a lot to deal with drivers around who fail to use blinkers or be on preferred speed for their lanes
love driving
it’s my favorite thing in the world
"i drive whenever i feel like it, but it’s super helpful when im upset"
"i love love loveee driving at night, preferably 11pm to 4am"
i play music depending on my mood and keep it on full volume
i always bring my water bottle and go get soda and have my vape
elite combo fs
sometimes it’s nice to talk things out aloud to myself as well
it’s just so so amazing and my favorite thing
i got my own car a few months ago and it’s GREAT on gas
i pay $26 and can drive for 6-10 hours (depending on if i turn the heat on)
the past 6 months have been a really rough time for me and ive gone out driving so much
i live in ct and i just get on the high way and go
there have been so many nights where all of a sudden i’ll see a sign welcoming me into a different state 😭😂 i’ve had to pay a few tolls because of this
i actually was considering becoming a truck driver because of this
it’s so nice to see that others have similar experiences :)
No No..
"I hate driving, even the suggestion makes me anxious."
Manual transmission on highways go brr.
Definitely helps with autism and my ADHD
I work 2.5 h north of my home
"Every week I commute and the drive is often the best part of that week.


If I time things right, I can turn into the sunset, have 80 synthwave music playing as I drive into a gorgeous tableau"
I live for it.
"I only find driving therapeutic if I’m on an empty road with miles to go.

If I’m driving around the city or it’s crowded, forget it, I’m a bundle of nerves.

Parking and parking lots especially give me anxiety attacks"
"There is way too much going on and too many things I have to do at the same time.

Plus I can’t even drive to the grocery store without a GPS because I’ll space out and either wake up in Canada or Mexico."
"When I'm stressed out, I go for a drive"
 I like getting lost intentionally and figuring out how to get home.
"No.


I try to drive in the slow lane"
I am an ADHD bad driver
It's a real issue.
"Nope, hate it."
I frequently take solo road trips that are several hundred miles long..
For no real reason
I thought I just had wanderlust but I think you're right about it being therapeutic
I don't like taking anyone with me
I think I enjoy not having to deal with people (other drivers notwithstanding).
"Depends, where I drive and when"
"Going to work at 5.00am yeh that was fun, empty roads lots of turns, once I memorised the route it was chill to drive and listen to music"
"

Driving to new place can be challenging though, have to keep track of gps prompts or try to memorise road names/ numbers.

Country roads are good when there is visibility"
"Not late at night with no street lights.

Some things are overwhelming, like large roundabouts (UK) at night and when I have passengers distracting me."
When I’m not stuck in traffic and when I’m not going round the same roundabout 4 times 😂
I especially find motorcycle riding to be the most therapeutic things
Car driving is OK but the ability to drive a motorcycle where you’re being a bit more attentive you’re expecting cars to pull out in front of you
You’re looking at lane options at all times you’re constantly considering who’s gonna pull out in front of you or who’s gonna do something stupid– – I think honestly it’s the full complete concentration and focus that requires that for me has been such a soothing and relaxing thing
"Unfortunately, getting married riding a motorcycle is not an option now, but truthfully it and playing the piano with the two most therapeutic and relaxing things I’ve ever done"
"I have thought, though to be honest that being a truck driver would be an ideal gig, and that I would probably very much enjoy it."
+1 for manual transmission and an open road
"I loved coming home from class late at night because manual transmission + empty streets = joyous night driving. 


Man, it felt good. 


I miss that car."
Yeah part of my daily commute in my semi has me going down a long stretch of US highway that hasn’t been updated to limited access so there’s lots of stoplights and speed limit changes
Would not be fun in a manual lol
I do enjoy driving them though just on my own time
Might have to eventually get a fun car that’s a stick
Current car is a 2019 Chrysler 300 AWD and backup vehicle is a 1984 Chevy C10 pickup
Always had a soft spot for boats/land yachts
Miss my 1998 Cadillac Eldorado too bad the Northstar is such a terrible engine.
Saaaame
I love my manual
It's fun
Automatics are boring.
"Manuals are just right to stay occupied, it's kinda fun, there's a rhythm to it"
Miss mine
And traffic jams and manuals especially suckk
Open toad for sure.
My dad had an old VW bug that he let me drive for a couple of months
"All in all, a lot of fun even in a lot of traffic."
I can occasionally relate to that on days where I didn’t get enough sleep the night before but the meds/caffiene/nicotine help me even on bad days.
Northern Indiana
It’s a mix of suburban and rural for the most part
Chicago sucks but only because of other drivers
And I always have either music or podcasts on.
It was very stressful at first especially when I was over the road before I got the current gig
Driving the truck isn’t hard it’s the backing that’ll get you
But lots of the anxiety dissipates after you pass the test and even more after you’ve been doing it for a while.
Other drivers are almost always the source of stress for me on the road.
That’s my theory! But it’s interesting because not everyone has the same experience
Crazy how much diversity there is within people who have it.
"Don't wait too long to get a stick, manufacturers are phasing them out left and right."
Yeah I'm sure the driving part is great lol
But I feel soooo bad for the drivers when they have to back in on a busy street and it takes a couple minutes and they cause a bunch of traffic and everybody gets mad.
Yeah that was stressful for me too
First gig when I was over the road I had to deliver flower vases to these small mom and pop flower shops all over the country
"Backing a sleeper cab with a 53 foot trailer down tight alleyways in downtown Boston, Atlanta, Buffalo, etc"
"

Now I just haul scrap metal/crushed cars and most of the yards are big with plenty of room to turn around"
Plus a crane with a grapple loads/unloads the trailer.

How can I make myself actually do school work?

Here’s what worked for me
"Now disclaimer, we all work differently"
"

You have to sit down and force yourself, make it a routine"
"Repeat to yourself that you can do it, hype yourself up, if you tell yourself something over and over again it will happen (within reason)"
"

Exercise is very important"
"Channel that energy or lack of focus into push-ups, boxing or so on"
"Alternate, so do 25 push ups (or what you can do) then a minute of jumping jacks, this will prove to you that you can focus on switching tasks"
"Again this helped me, could be different"
"

Their really is no good answer"
"But know that you can guide yourself, eventually it becomes routine"
Your quality of life is only as good as the qualities of your thoughts.
I loaded up and took extra courses every semester 16 to 24 credit hours and worked part-time
"It was on campus not online, I lived far away from everything and everyone I ever knew"
"  Every week something was due, everyday we had lecture and quizzes, group work and presentations"
"I was smoking and using substances, stimulants"
I spent all my time in the library and 24 hour study hall
I worked out everyday too.

Is it normal to like doing dishes?

"I took Modafinil for a few times a week for years before being officially diagnosed and medicated as it is only a schedule 4 medicine in Australia, instead of a schedule 8 and was easily able to import them through the mail without the danger of commiting a serious crime.

Modafinil and Armodafinil are the weirdest chemicals ever as I found myself (along with others I know who take it) where I was constantly lowering the dose the longer I took it.

100mg was/is great, but then I realised 50mg was almost the same, and then I realised 25mg wasn't that much different to 50mg....very strange to me.

All of those doses worked for me, but each one lasted at least 12 hours and I had way less chance of sleeping with them then I do with dexamphetamine now.

Start with 100mg and see how you go, there's no real danger in going overboard with it, as it didn't increase my heartrate or anything potentially dangerous like that, it just messed with my sleep if I didn't take it early enough in the morning."

My wife got a 10mg dose she takes at 2 which makes it wear off painlessly.
I take 10mg IR Adderall 7-8 hours after the Vyvanse and it buffers it well
"I was on 30mg when I was diagnosed back in 2016, then on 40mg, and I’ve been on 50mg ever since as it’s the perfect dose for me but I can tell you from experience that lower doses don’t equal lesser effects but the effects will almost completely subside over time - For myself, anyway"
"

When it wears off I can still tell largely because I start to feel tired and my motivation sort of goes but that’s literally it"
"If I need a boost I’ll grab a coffee or something but overtime the comedown effects went from moodiness over small things, anxiety and jitteriness to just tiredness"
"

I also noticed that drinking a ton of water whilst on Vyvanse helped a lot with the comedown compared to when I didn’t drink as much"
"

I know it’s annoying but just wait it out and in a couple of months on the perfect dose the side effects will subside and reach of level of mainly just tiredness.

Hope this was some help!"
To add: I’m a fitness instructor so I begin a lot of my days with a 3:30 am alarm and try to take it early to not mess with my sleep but have days where I’m also coaching in the evening and I find I need it especially when I’m teaching the beat based barre classes cause it requires focus on keeping the beat while also coaching over the mic and cueing and connecting members and I just don’t know how to make the medicine work best for me
"Following because I took my first dose today, and same."
And I find that alcohol helps to relieve the come down but is absolutely not something I want to rely on or make a consistent habit for my health
For the 5 days I took vyvanse that was exactly how I felt lol
I have my first coffee of the day at that point
And maybe a nap
Usually I bounce back after that.
"Not taking it consistently could be the issue, as it kinda builds up in your system so the come down isn't bad"
"But if you are on and off it, the come down can be a lot more rough."
I wish we could discuss supplements
"I used to have the same problem, but I found something that smooths things out very consistently"
But oh well
Guess this subreddit is only for everything except that.
I had the same issue
My doctor prescribed me an extra little 5 mg of adderall immediate release for the end of the day if I need it
"I ended up preferring the immediate release, so now I just take 2 or 3 doses (depending on if I need to be alert in the evening or not) a day of the 5 mg immediate release adderall"
I just switched to instant release years ago bcoz of this
Much better just gotta take 3x a day
"Like original adderall, Dexedrine etc."
I’m currently taking 30mg in the morning and another 20mg after lunch
I was getting a big come down late afternoon
Also i was finding if I took a higher dose in one go I would get a lot of tension in my tummy.
"I hated vyvanse for that reason, i much prefer dex which is very similar but without the awful crash, have you tried that?  i take it in halves and a small dose at the end of the day for a smooth landing"
Maybe a lower dose would have less side effects? I currently take 30 which I think is a standard dose given my diagnosis and symptoms but struggling so much with losing my energy and personality I’m willing to try anything
How does she sleep?
I didn’t realize: 10mg was an option.
Did your doctor have any trouble prescribing you both?
"i take 50mg a day too!! i have my prescriber write for it as 10mg capsules though, five per day"
"

sometimes i will take 40mg in the morning and 10 at noon if i have an especially long day"
"

i’m a student and also work part time and there are days i’m at school at 7am and working till 9"
and then i still have to go home and shower/eat/laundry/dishes/take care of my pets
"

so sometimes, even though vyvanse works for 12-14 hours, it’s not enough"
taking the 10mg at 12-2pm really helps carry me through the rest of my night.
Do you think you might be overwhelmed and not realizing it? Like the Vyvanse is allowing you to bypass that awareness? I'm just reflecting on my experience of my nervous system after being oblivious to overwhelm
"I wonder if you could titrate at all? I've personally been learning about what overwhelms me now that I have a diagnosis and drugs (though mine are PRN) and noticing that there are small and big things I can do to better regulate.


No idea if this will resonate with you at all"
I'm also an early riser who hits the gym first thing
"I do a ton of things where I have to be super online for other people, so maybe we have some shared experiences with this? 


Whether or not this makes sense, I really hope you're able to find something that helps you feel better! Such a bummer to end the day on a low note."
Did you stop completely or try a different medication?
"I’m not sure how you interpreted it or how it was intended, but I interpreted OP as saying:

Their wife has an ordinary dose of Vyvanse, which she takes in the morning, and additionally, she has a second, 10 mg dose, which she takes mid-afternoon, which helps smooth out the effects of Vyvanse wearing off as time elapses into the evening.

Not sure if that helps, but that was my thought."
Fine with 5mg of melatonin and no screen time 1 hour for bed.
i take 50mg vyvanse per day and there are days i forgot to take it and don’t get around to it till 3-4pm
"

i sleep even better those nights"
something about it calms my brain and helps me relax so i can get to sleep
"

for example [this](https://imgur.com/a/yY77NZa) is how i slept a couple nights ago on vyvanse, and [this](https://imgur.com/a/YgJJB8J) is what my typical night’s sleep looks… i tried to pick some nights where i slept similar amounts for a clearer comparison"
"

although i have comorbid PTSD and GAD… so sleep has always come harder for me"
but something about a stimulant during bedtime actually seems to work better than everything else i’ve tried like trazodone/quetiapine/mirtazapine/doxepin/z drugs.
"vyvanse comes as capsules in 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70mg, although some regions like canada haven’t approved the 70mg dose so in some places it’s only 10 through 60mg"
"

the chewables similarly come in 10-60mg at 10mg increments but no 70mg anywhere for some reason"
"

personally i get my 50mg filled as 5 10mg’s a day so that i can take 40mg in the morning and 10mg at noon/afternoon!!"
No issues at all
That is correct
I also have ADHD and miss steps when explaining
Thank you for your help I will try talking to mine about this!
Does it affect your sleep taking the adderall?
I have a long workday so it typically doesn’t
We did lower the Vyvanse by 10mg at first to see if it would
It didn’t… eventually went back to the prior Vyvanse dose
Just have to be cognizant of timing.

Write down everything that you thought of last time after you left the office
"When you get there this time explain to them that you have ASD and why that makes it difficult for you to answer questions sometimes (tell them about the chair, the stress, everything - write this down too if that makes it easier) and that you wrote some things down that you remembered after you left last time.

If they don't listen to you and at least consider what you're saying to them then they aren't doing their job properly"

"They'll be reading your body language as well, this may not mess things up the way you think."
Thank you for your answer
"  
  
For the ASD, I told them during the first session, because the reason why I'm getting assessed in the first place is because there are a lot of symptoms that are more adhd like symptoms rather than autism related in my opinion"
" 
And when I was looking online for people's experiences with their autism, executive dysfunction, how they overcame their issues,.."
I found a lot of AuDHDers testimonies and I related way more with their experience than with ASD only experiences
I also told them about that too during the first appointment
" 
But I think I missed a lot of points there too"
I had a list ready to take with me but I forgot it because I was in a hurry
"  
And I also tend to forget a lot"
"So even though I kept trying to make a mental list on my way there I couldn't remember all of it and the stress didn't help either.

I already started to make a list after I came back from the second session with things I remembered and also things that I think might by ADHD symptoms as well after looking at them from another perspective."
I don't know if I have a lot of body language
"I don't show my emotions, my voice is monotone and I mask a lot"
" 
I don't really know if my discomfort was visible, the only thing I can think of in terms of body language, is me looking at the wall to try to remember stuff"
And also I guess my inhability to make eye contact too.
"Nice, it sounds like you've got it handled then"
"Just some ideas that you can maybe use if you're really worried about it and want to be as sure as possible not to forget your list again: you could try taking a picture of it on a mobile phone, or send it to yourself as an email to a Google account that you could potentially even log into at their office to retrieve, or e-mail it to the doctor themself and maybe write ""for review during my next appointment"" in the subject line - I think it would be odd for them to mind you doing something like that, anyway.

Good luck and I hope everything works out in the best way that it can for you :)"
Looking at the wall and not doing eye contact is something they specifically focused on with my brother and I.

"I was trialled on Ritalin when first diagnosed before figuring out Ritalin was not for me and being prescribed Dexamphetamine instead.

I now have over 150 Ritalin 10mg tablets just sitting in my bedside drawers."
"Can you fill a script for a different stimulant before 60 days? 

I’m surprised you were able to fill for 60 days, I thought stimulants could only be filled 30 days at a time."
"When I asked the pharmacist about this, they said they’re not allowed to accept the old meds."
No you do not have to give the old meds back
Typically 2 weeks at a new dose will be enough to tell if it's working
It's common to have to try different doses of medication
They start you at the low dose and work up to the effective dose
" (FYI, max dose is 72mg - there is a lot of room for adjustment)"
It might not be the medication that is the issue but the dose
Patience is tough for many of us but it is necessary for long-term success.

Hopefully doubling the dose will be effective for you"
"If not, it’s nice that your provider is open to trying something else"
Good luck!

I am also ADHD (combined type) + ASD
"

It’s the worst"

"Simple, easy, and you can do them anywhere"

"

If people are around me enough they will notice my breathing and start commenting about it before they really get to know me"
"I’m a very easy going person (by practice, not naturally) so it’s easy to joke with me"

"Living example, if you will"
"

Don’t give up"
"Finding that balance has taken me many years of practice, failure, and some wins"

I don’t have any emotions right now be stunted
Mmm yes but in a good way.
I find they just help me regulate my emotions and stay calm
"I didn't know this was ""normal"" but I roll with it, nothing wrong with just chilling"
Sure sometimes I have a Idgaf attitude but honestly those same people were once complaining that I was too emotional
"Go with the flow, nothing wrong with how you feel either way

"Didn't realise meds were meant to assist with this.

Hoping to go on Vyvanse from name brand Ritalin next month so will see how things go"
I’m on 15 mg dexi once a day (extended release) and I find it’s just enough to calm my brain where I can stop and think before I  react
Still have my emotions (thankfully) I do  find closer to the evening though when it’s worn off I am definitely more quiet and tired
"Kind of piggybacking off this in hopes that someone can relate.

I’ve felt more regulated too"
"Not as much of a doormat as before, but now I worry I have too little patience? I don’t think I’m getting irritated over trivial things, but 4-5 years of pent up resentment is starting to show up in my more toxic relationships"
"

This week I kind of unloaded on an ex who had been slow walking a boundaries conversation for almost a year, had yelled at me multiple times, been inconsiderate about oversharing sensitive details and just overall hurtful from my perspective"
"When I point out my frustrations/resentments, she switches to crying and fawning about disappointing me but this time instead of consoling her, I went too far and just kept going"
"

Therapist thinks I’m gaining clarity and setting boundaries but I tend to regret it later"
Also been writing long walls of texts (like this post).
So you’re on Ritalin now and changing to Vyvanse?
Yes
Okay
I’m thinking of doing the same thing
It would be nice if you would do an update on the difference at some point
When it becomes funded here sure
The difference for them is irrelevant to you
Your minds and chemistries are entirely different

I assume it’s because we find ourselves so entrenched with others or doing things we like (hyper fixations) that when we’re alone, the lack of stimulation or attention makes us realize we aren’t doing anything"
"

Because we aren’t doing anything, we find ourselves overthinking things and digging deeper into the rabbit hole which makes us detach ourselves from reality for a while and than leaves us feeling either drained or shocked by our emotions that when when snap back into reality, it feels like we’ve just experienced something that actually happened."

"I used to vape like you, but I quit about 2-ish years ago and it was pretty easy for me since I made my own juice and could lower the nic down to whatever I wanted."
You're self-medicating
Been there
"It's not as good of a stimulant as prescriptions but it can quiet the chaos for a moment...boom, I was hooked!
If your doctor knew anything they would see it's a symptom of overall unmedicated ADHD.
I had the worst time quitting nicotine before being medicated, before diagnosis, even.
When I got on ADHD meds I decided to quit drinking"
I would have a standard glass of wine almost every day and wasn't feeling so great about it
I just stopped
"Like, zero problem"
I believe the fact that I am properly medicated for my ADHD makes me less susceptible to addiction
YMMV
"It’s very hard for people to adhd to quit nicotine cold turkey, mostly because it’s a form of self medicating because of the stimulant effects of nicotine"
"

Wellbutrin is often used for nicotine cessation, but it works best with nicotine replacement therapy"
"

You would likely also benefit from replacing the hand to mouth motion with something.

Getting access to stimulant meds is worth it in my opinion"
"I’ve never been addicted to nicotine so I don’t know what that’s like, but stimulants are really helpful and there’s a very large chance they will improve your quality of life a lot more than vaping."
"I smoked fairly regularly for 20+ years but with Wellbutrin I actually can’t stand cigarettes anymore, even after a few drinks which is when I always craved one"
"Also, Wellbutrin + focalin checks a lot of mental health boxes for me"
Definitely worth a try.
"Ask for a long-term measurement, like 24h, with a portable device"
"This should help if it's not a general problem.

Edit:

A bit of background, I was also diagnosed with high BP"
"Basically, I was just nervous at the doctor, and the 24-hour diagram was pretty normal."
"I used to smoke, stopped that and now I vape all the fucking time and drink red bull throughout the day"
It's therapeutic (both vaping and red bull)
BP / heart rates almost always within range
They check it every 6 months to renew the script
It was once a bit high but not crazy
How bad are we talking?? I don't think vape = high BP like automatically
More you've got a health condition that needs looking into and managing
"

Get your BP under control"
Go to ur doc
Unless you wanna die early
It's called the silent killer for a reason
"Not to be a cunt, but don't ignore it please 🙏 I've seen what happens when people do this and trust me witnessing loved ones impacted by a stroke is pretty shit."
"I bought an at home BP wrist monitor, because at the doctor's office my BP was insanely high for my entire life"
"And asked my doc if I could test at home for a certain amount of days at different times of the day, and then compare the results to when I was in the Drs office vs home"
I tested well within normal every time at home
"So my next appt I wore the wrist monitor while she used her BP machine to make sure mine was reading right, and it was"
So she officially diagnosed me with White Coat Hypertension and it's in my records now and it has made everything SOOOO much easier having it in my records
I haven't been harassed about meds and BP since then
"

I bought a wrist monitor that connected to an app and saved every reading so she could see the data was recorded properly and I wasn't just making numbers up"
Highly recommend:)
"I was recently prescribed Clonidine for insomnia and ADHD (in addition to Adderall, which I've been on for a couple years)"
"It's prescribed for a number of different things, but most often to lower blood pressure"
Maybe this is an option you could discuss with your doc in the meantime?
"No, it's not the nicotine"
Your BP would be raised all the time if it were from nicotine
You have white coat syndrome or their machine is wrong
Broken BP machines are super common
You also need to ask them to retake your BP manually if it's ever high in office
"

Start taking your BP twice a day and keep a log"
"That should convince your provider that it's anxiety causing your elevated BP, not nicotine"
"

Smoking can significantly raise your BP over time because it contributes to atherosclerosis"
Vaping does not
"The increase in BP from nicotine is minor and temporary, much like caffeine."
"Yeah, it was even like that when I was donating plasma"
Was usually good to go after the second attempt
"Not today though, we tried like 4 times."
I see him again on the 4th and am quitting vaping til then to see if that is what it was.
So true
Been through that too.
100% agreed.
Any good recs for replacing the hand to mouth motion? Something I’m really struggling with right now 😩
I'm on Guanfacine which is a blood pressure medication
Been a week since I started it.
This sounds scientific but I still think it's the nicotine lmfao
"Not sure why you were downvoted, there are studies showing nicotine in lozenges and patches to help people quit smoking do not increase BP"
"It’s possible there is something else in a vape doing it, but also possible it was an anxiety reading or broken machine as you said."
Watch your salt intake too and don't have a coffe the day you see him.
toothpicks or sugarfree/lowcal lollipops
and benadryl if you can't sleep from it (worst part of quitting smoking imo)
I hate coffee so we are good there! Haha
"I'll be sure to watch my salt as well, thanks."

How do I deal with this 'mental block' and actually do work?

I have been toying with the idea of hooking myself up to a shock collar.
Hmm.
well if you figure it out let me know! I’ve seen so many tips about planners and scheduling
I just can’t execute or follow through
I know most of the time what I need to do it’s just doing it
There’s some forgetfulness in there too but it’s mainly getting it done
Usually it’s just my anxiety that motivates me to get something done
Then when I start doing a task I feel motivated to do a few more
"That anxiety actually comes in handy once in a while! 

Such as my clothes have been in the dryer for 4 days now but then my dad’s clothes are in the washer"
I know if I don’t get up and motivated to get them out I’m gonna have to hear about it
So getting my clothes out is now a priority due to anxiety of getting yelled at
Horrible solution but it’s proven for me
I guess… trying to find a better way… :/
We all get that sort of problem
Sucks
"

If it's something you want to do regularly at a specific day/time, instead of saying 'I'll do that at 4pm', try 'I do X at 4pm.' Say that every time you think of the thing you're doing"
 This doesn't work right away but after a few days it makes it more likely you'll actually do it at 4pm
"

Caveat: Nothing ever works 100% of the time"
"

For other types of stuff, it sometimes helps me if I can gin up any kind of interest or excitement at all about it"
This is obviously really damn hard
"But sometimes it's 'I wonder how fast I can do the thing', or 'I wonder if there's a better way to do this'"
"Or even a bingo type thing (I just thought of this one , haven't tried it yet): Okay, here's my bingo card of things I expect to see/feel/whatever while doing the thing, let's see how fast I get a bingo'.

Like, I'm a software developer"
I might be in a codebase that's really old and riddled with certain old programming techniques
"I might put a few of those on a bingo card, or just a scorecard"
'17 instances of really complicated if statements? New record in one file...'
"I don't do a lot but sometimes with around the house stuff I pair it with a podcast I like and make it something to look forward to, plus trying to decouple all my baggage around ""doing tasks"" by getting rid of the shame and the expectation of failure"
Easier said than done I know
"But basically this, trying to make it interesting or fun or at least using positive self talk instead of beating myself up"
"Making sure to pause and kind of compliment myself when I succeed at something small, and also giving myself little small tasks to succeed at to practice success instead of practicing failure"
Sometimes I find scheduling a task just doesn't work but latching on to spark of interest in doing something to do it RIGHT NOW gets it done
But my life is a mess soo...

Everyone is different so anything we could tell you likely wouldn't apply to you
You should be talking about this to a medical professional
It's the same for whatever happened to you in the past with Vyvanse
"When you started having a bad time with it, you should have spoken to a medical professional then"
They'd have probably had you try other medications
"If you did and they didn't listen to you then request that you be referred to someone else who will.

I hope you can find a medication that works for you :)"

Your frustration is definitely valid
"I'd be mad too!

Is your doctor also a general practitioner? If so, insurance companies often except them to see 50 patients a day"
They get really overworked
So sometimes they do prioritize making sure that people with physical ailments get their prescription refills signed first
It's just not a good system.
Urgent care will not help you
"Caffeine, exercise and prayers will have to see you thru"
"
You'll need to talk to your doctor re: the refull timing commitment they offer their patients"
If they told you to wait so late to submit a refill request they should be ashamed! I contact my Dr 7 days in advance to request they send an RX refill to the pharmacy for them to hold
Then I contact the PHARMACY to have it filled when I have 2 pills left.
"You do know we’re still in a shortage right? I’m not sure what part of the world you’re in, but it sounds like it’s not being filled because they don’t have any"
Either the pharmacy isn’t communicating that or your doctor probably hasn’t been in the office
"Brand name stimulants have been the hardest for pharmacies to acquire, ESPECIALLY Vyvanse"
Believe me it’s not fun and I know exactly how you feel
"You’re gonna have to get in touch directly with your doctor or someone at your pharmacy, you might have to switch to something else in the meantime (good luck)."
They’re in family medicine unfortunately
I wish they could get their system figured out🥲
Definitely taking advantage of caffeine
I just wish they could send multiple prescriptions to hold so I didn’t have to mess around with getting my pills every month
"I probably should have called more than 4 days in advance I guess, but they usually get them done in 2-3 days"
Does the pharmacy do anything when you call them? Do they contact the doctors too?
"Unfortunately it hasn’t even been sent to the pharmacy, which is the issue, not the pharmacy being out of the medication"
I have not ever had an issue with the pharmacy being out of medication since switching to my current one
Pro tip everyone: go to Walmart pharmacy
Yes my pharmacy will also reach out to my doctor's office but I'm not sure if it actually speeds response time but I figure better to have me and the pharmacy contacting the Dr vs me having to do it all on my own
"
By contacting my Dr a week in advance and have the Dr office send my Rx to the pharmacy early for them to hold until they are legally able to dispense it I know that I've started the ball rolling far enough in advance to prevent myself from getting in a jam"
"
Controlled substance laws make it hard for those of us who legit need these meds to function"
It's horrible and unlikely to change anytime soon
All we can do is craft ways to work through a system that is diametrically opposed to the way our brains work.

i was just diagnosed about a month ago and have been trying medication too
i think you should make sure to tell your doctor exactly how you feel
i don’t have too much knowledge but i have a few ideas
maybe you could try another medication
or you could go back to the 20mg and then add another medication as well
i know that is common
i definitely don’t think you got used to the medication
that would not have happened so fast.

"Frequent fun-breaks chained with small, individual tasks is a solid ADHD management strategy"
Kudos for figuring it out on your own.
"Super smart, I do something similar too"
Playing a game helps me relax so I try to get what I can done and I can reward myself with some game time
It works pretty well for me too :)
I do this with anything I want as a reward
"It feels ridiculous to have to train myself like a dog but I'd do a task then have some ice cream, or let myself rot on tik Tok for 20 minutes then do another.

Edit: literally set a time though"
That time blindness sets in fast.

If I’ve got a load of washing going, it’s easy to tidy the kitchen and unload the dishwasher.

If I’m downloading something, or backing something up, it’s easy to tidy my desk or vacuum."
I do that but with crochet
"I do two rows, then I do a task"
My creativity moments are my rewards between chores
Thanks for the idea!
I do this too
It's an excellent system.
My in-between activity is Diamond Painting
"A 10 minutedabble here, a 15 minute dabble there…"
"It helps on days where my brain **really** does not want to adult at all. 

If I catch myself building a mental wall because I have to do the dishes, I’ll go and sit down and work on my painting … and set an alarm on my watch"
"M

I use the alarm instead of the timer because I can tell it to either stop or snooze when the alarm goes off"
"And if I hit snooze, I get an extra nine minutes"
Knowing I can hit the snooze takes away the snap of upset that I feel when the alarm goes off initially because I’ve been interrupted now that I am engrossed in something.
"I've had a strategy like this work miracles for me on the right day, but I'm also likely to get caught up in the game for a lot longer than I planned"
Anyone have strategies for preventing this?
"I do the same thing, only with a different game"
The current game is warhammer space marine 2.
I gaslight myself into believing that I’m having company over everyday to get myself to clean.
I do the same thing but playing TDM in Call of Duty! I give myself a task that I have to race to complete in between games
Having a limited amount of time makes it like a little game.
What if I view playing video games and actually using any mental effort at all as not fun
"I do the same ^ ^ Ive had another with a farm too but usually I'ts been all about deck building games for me tho, i play one round and I do one task"
In a few hours ive done plenty things. 
LOL ngl I did the same thing
I would play two games instead of just one
"For me, I just had to practice discipline and if I did more than one round, I would do more than one task"
"

To start, you can determine what you want to complete"
You can do this by writing a list of tasks that you want to get done
"If the tasks are daunting, write sub tasks for them"
"I like to gamify this and put it in Finch, a self-care app that rewards you points when you complete goals"
"

Overall, you gotta find a system that works for you"
"And knowing myself and others with ADHD, sometimes you gotta have different systems for different days lol."

"I can’t speak to what it’ll be like in Italy/with your Italian doctor, but I’ll at least say that I was a great student in elementary school"
I was even in an advanced/“gifted” program
The main notes I’d get on my report cards (that I can remember) is that I would just talk way too much
"“Distracting” other classmates, talking in line when we’re supposed to be quiet, or other inappropriate times"
I was a chatterbox
"So, much like you"
"I also barely EVER got in trouble in school, but if I did it was because of that (only happened once or twice though, generally I was liked by teachers and could be kind of a teachers pet)"
"I’m in the US.

During my diagnosis, it was mainly a behavioral interview"
"It has been a long time since then so I don’t remember it exactly, but we would have talked about that time period"
"It may have been more behavior focused but I think the academic performance would have had to come up, even if just because I brought it up while describing myself back then in general"
"But IMO the academic performance is part of behavior and is relevant to the questions— eg “How did you do in school, did you struggle to keep up or focus? Did you forget to do your homework a lot? Did you struggle with grades?” All relates to behavioral stuff"
And people with ADHD present differently
Some will struggle and have a really hard time in school
But doing well in school is not an automatic disqualifier.
Thank you for your answer
"The thing that weirds me out is that I never, ever did homework"
But I got good grades most of the time
"Great grades, sometimes"
"Then when I got to middle school, I started having really bad grades"
That carried on until now
"Also, I don’t even know if they will ask me for an interview"
"So far, I was only asked to fill in these questionnaires, two about adult struggles and one about childhood struggles, and submit my elementary school end of year reports."
"Yeah, the testing process seems to vary a lot"
It may depend on the psychiatrist or the location or something
"I see so many people talking about their tests or questionnaires, but I never really did that (I mean maybe I did in conjunction with the interview, but I don’t really remember)"
I just remember that my evaluation process was mostly a one-on-one interview that went really in depth
"That might be less common, I don’t know"
"

But also, if you did really well in elementary and then your grades started slipping in middle school, that’s definitely relevant information and seems to support your diagnosis"
Also never doing homework
"(Elementary school didn’t have “grades” like middle and high school for me, so if it was like you, it might not have affected your grade that much back then but by the time you’re in middle school it does.)

Edit: I wonder if you’re also able to provide some explanatory/supportive documentation when providing the elementary school reports"
It wouldn’t make sense to me to judge on those alone; they of course are a summary and don’t capture everything
"So if you’re able to explain and describe it as well, that would be good."
"Elementary school in Italy, back in my day (lol), had “grades” that were words"
"For example, “good” or “excellent”"
"They changed it a decade or two ago, I think I remember it being in talks when I was starting middle school, but I’m not sure when it got put into effect.

I will ask my doctor if the doctor who will review my paperwork and do my diagnosis will be okay with me sending extra documentation"
Thanks.

Just wanted to disclose: Ambien is a sleeping pill lol
"I think you meant Adderall.

It would help to know exactly what it is you’re looking to achieve with these medications"
"In my case, I have severe inattentive ADHD and executive disfunction, I need stimulants like Vyvanse and Adderall to help me do things that “normal” people don’t think twice about doing, like chores and getting up early for work"
"For me it was Vyvanse, but I turned 26 and got switched to generics and they suck so I’ve been SOL for a year now"
"Prices are outrageous for the “good” stuff.

In terms of mentality and what to expect (assuming you’re in my wheelhouse): Medications like stimulants aren’t going to make you do certain things, but they will help you do them"
"You still have to take initiative, but you won’t have to give it a second thought"
"You’ll feel like a superhuman the first few weeks, but that feeling will go away"
Use that time to develop good habits and make the necessary changes you want to make
A big misconception is that medications will “fix things”
"In reality, they just make things easier"
Hope this helps 👍

I'm in the exact position
 I was on Adderall 30 MG XR for 15 years
 I took 2.5 years off and last week I started Concerta
" 

I am feeling the effects of the new medication, but it does not feel or act like Adderall"
" I am going to give it more time.

I do not want to be dependent or addicted to adderall"
 The purpose of medication is to treat symptoms
 Right...?
"I relate for sure, and idek why.."
"

I started meds for the first time like 9 months ago"
Vyvanse
Was exceptional
Then switched to generic
"Not nearly as good, but still great for me.

Then I went through several ups and downs where I had to take breaks because of finances, insurance, switching psychiatrists, blood pressure scare, etc etc etc.

On and off Vyvanse generic a few times, and each time it's felt less and less like it used to :/

Recently it just completely stopped working at all"
"Was convinced it's the fucking generic scammy bullshit.

Got an Adderall booster and I didn't like it anywhere near as much as Vyvanse initially, but after a bit I felt like I could see the benefits.

Was also on Lexapro for a month and felt dead inside so stopped taking it, and it definitely made me feel a bit better and made the Adderall work a bit better.

But I ran out of Adderall and finally got more Vyvanse (generic) and now it just feels like I'm taking a sugar pill"
"Adderall was nowhere near what Vyvanse used to do for me, but at least it felt like it was working a bit.

I'm just so stressed and confused"
Idk what's working for me and what isn't
"Idk how much of it is bullshit pseudo-grade generic problems, vs"
"med combinations, vs"
"tolerance, vs"
"life stress.

So many variables and I just wanna feel decent and happy and productive, ya know?

Idk how unrealistic I'm being, and whether part of me is being a drug addict and chasing the highs and antidepressant qualities....or how much of me is genuinely just not reacting very well to current meds/dosage/generics.

Shit sucks"
I understand that
The urge to go back to adderall so much Actually makes me want to avoid it
Such a strong dependence.
Thanks for sharing
I sometimes feel it's a weird lingering addiction.

I get this sometimes
If I'm scrolling when my meds kick in I run the chance of focusing on that instead or deciding to fall down a Google rabbit hole and search random interesting stuff

ALL THE TIME
My brain moves faster than my mouth.
Yes lol
Apparently I say it in my brain but I verbally skip it
Sometimes I catch myself though.
"It’s interesting because I think I do this to avoid over explaining.
But the problem is that it’s not easy, so I end up talking like my thought process is in a blender getting all jumbled up and confused."
"I have trouble getting thoughts out of my head in any form.  Verbally, or writing stuff down, drawing.  It all comes out as gibberish."
"I don't skip because my mouth wasn't as fast as my brain, I skip because I think OTHER people's brains are just as fast so I don't need the middle bits because you see where I was going, of course."
"I will start telling a story in the middle, then realize I'm not making sense.  Then I stop and think, and try to organize my story into something coherent.  "
Very common
I was on a work call today and someone had to say “I think Bill is trying to say”
I swear that was what I said.
"I didn’t even realize I did that except I had nice enough friends to say “no, I have no idea what you mean"
 What?”
"Similar to that, I find myself over analyzing or giving context to something I haven't even finished saying yet"
"Something like ""something happened to me the other day"
"Not that it's a big deal, and I'm okay now, although I guess it was my fault and I should be more careful next time"
It shows how sometimes I do not pay attention to my surroundings
"But a goose honked and tried to attack me because I got too close to its babies without me noticing."""
I that when I type 🫠
Yes
Very common every day things for us
Yeah
And I text like that too
"When I text my husband I say, where going today? And stuff like that"
Yup
"Somehow I kind of adapted to skipping the beginning of sentences, prepositions, sometimes nouns...or assume the person knows the subject when I kinda skipped it"
Yeah.....
"I just talk really, really fast."
"Not when I talk, but I tend to skip words when I type."
Yes & it's one of my fears when I have to talk for a long period of time
"Another reason why - at the risk of sounding robotic - I have to have a script of my speech because if I only freestyle or rely on memory, this is bound to happen."
"I do it when I write, so I have to double check everything carefully because I tend to skip it again in rereading, too"
Pete Holmes made a tweet years ago..
"""you ever find yourself rehearsing for a casual conversation?"" I do this and even moreso with important convos"
"Like, I'll gear up to state my case or position to my boss, plan out this very convincing argument for.."
"whatever, then when I finally start talking, I speak as though they had already heard the bulk of it, missing the plot altogether and seemingly just providing them with cause for concern regarding my mental state.

I do the same when I try to make a joke"
A lot of my humor is based in movie/TV references a la Abed from Community.
yes i somehow pick up a thought in the middle  and just speak out the rest
"it's so natural to me that i could tell my comms is off but i couldn't it pin it down until my partner said one day ""i think the first part stayed in your head"" and i was like 😶 yes, yes it did"
it took me time but now i can often tell that i'm doing this and i start over with the part that i left out in my head
When I’m typing or writing I do this
When I’m speaking I glitch so bad so I started talking slower on purpose
Five words come out at the same time so instead I make a weird noise hahaha.
YES
My wife does this because she thinks I can read her mind
We're currently both going though the ADHD diagnostic testing
My husband does
He skips the entire 2nd half of sentences when hes excited
We tease him a lot for it.
Omg it is SO frustrating
"I know exactly what I’m meaning to say, but my mouth can’t keep up with my brain and I trip over my words and leave out crucial parts of my statement making it sound like a fractured convoluted mess."
"Yes, to the point that I’ve become the quiet one because it’s hard to keep up with my brain"
I used to have a friend who could keep up with that sir of stuff in conversation
"We would both sort of shorthand our conversations, and it was very smooth"
Found out years into our friendship that he also had ADHD
"Didn't know much about it at the time, but looking back, it makes a lot of sense"
I miss having friends sometimes.
"I definitely have this all the time!

Do you guys also ever have the answer to something(and you know you have the answer) and you suddenly can't remember your answer until you're doing something else or are no longer in the event of when it should have been answered? This happens to me way too often."
I say completely the wrong word sometimes as my minds someplace else
Words can be back to front to.
"Constantly, but I tend to just skip the first half and blurt out the last half"
My wife knows how my brain works
She'll let me finish my half thought and then politely ask what led up to that last half
"Then I get to play ""backtrack thru the brain bees"" and fill in the gaps for her"
I'm so glad she understands and is patient with me.
I make jokes
Lots of jokes
"Sometimes, they're too meta to be understood by anyone - requiring a precursor joke or explanation, usually from some connection i made in my head, that the other party has not yet made.."
same thing happens while texting
i just leave out entire words ahaha
Yep
"And found out in uni, the time where I also got diagnosed, that I also do it in writing..."
"My mother does this, she just can’t tell a consistent story"
Making us have to guess often what she is talking about
"Yeah, it feels like my mouth is trying to catch up with my brain a lot of the time.

It also happens to me when I am typing on a computer, I just randomly skip half of a word sometimes."
I do the exact opposite
I’m a great storyteller.
i dont even remember what i said so i just nonsense 80% of the time
I think so
But I’m also kinda dissociating when I’m trying to talk 🤣 and then I just give up halfway through because I’m frustrated I can’t properly express myself
Buttt that’s probably not adhd-related 😆
But how many of you can fill in the blanks also? I feel like I know what everyone is trying to say and yet I feel like I have to over explain
Happens pretty rarely when i talk but all the time when i type
I am usually able to self correct though.
No
I didn't present this
"I do, however, sometimes stop talking because I don't feel like finishing or I simply forget forget what I was saying. "
Yup
I stop mid sentence a lot and it annoys people lol
"Like, I don’t realize what I didn’t finish but I did in my head."
Yuuuuuuup
My kids have taken to just accepting whatever it was that I said with a confused look and a shrug
It makes it extra fun when we're doing homeschool lessons
Lol.
That's an excellent description.It's exactly how I feel.
FR AND IT'S SO IRRITATING
"Regrettably, I have the opposite problem"
"I find myself saying things I shouldn't because my brain doesn't stop my mouth in time, lol."
I ask my husband sometimes “did I say this outloud or in my head” lol
Or I’ll start a conversation with him in the middle of a thought and he has no context why I randomly started talking about something
Do you clutter too by any chance?
"Im impulsive so have to try harder not to over explaining.
If someone asks me what my diet and nutrition is like, boy you better be ready to sit down and listen for 2 hours…"
Why say many words when few do trick?
My liiiife
"😂 It's hard for people to follow when I haven't even said A + B yet, but I've already given the post-analysis"
"Like, the whole time, instead of being able to just listen & understand what this context is about, they're just thinking, ""Where is this going? How did we even get here?""

How you said your goose story -- that's me telling the story, too"
"*hugs*

Side note: geese are jerks & don't need an excuse to fuck you up"
Source: two geese as pets when I was a kid.
"Are you me!? I do this all the time and I'm sure some people are thinking dang get to the point already!? But I just can't be breif like ever, not even in text or letters lol! I try but it enver ever comes out as short ever lol!"
"My mom texts like that too, and writes letters like that sometimes if she writes really fast"
"I tease her sometimes about it and say ""try that again in English this time please!""🤣🤣 i typo a lot or sometimes type the word jumbled up like I'll have all the letters that spell the word but end up typing it mixed up lol!"
In High School I remember if I was writing when stressed I tended to leave off the first letter or two of my words.
"I ask my husband that all the time, or preface things with “I don’t know if I said this out loud already…” lol"
Verbally? Yeah
I’m fairly spatially organised though if that’s what you meant.
:)
"Oh God I've gotten the ""where is this going?"" I'm like ""I promise all this context and flashbacks and details all have a purpose and it all connects in the end 😭""



Or when the conversation keeps shifting to different topics and after a whole two hours you finally connect everything back to your original thought. "
"When they say that I'm all like ""oh :( okay"" and I wrap it up and telling the story just doesn't feel as satisfying because I didn't get to give the 5 chapters of background and context to make the story worth it.


Exactly, same! This is why I'm not a great texter"
"While they respond with single sentences almost immediately, I spend some time building up a whole paragraph as a response."
"Hope you'll read this, you may already know that but I found out that cluttered speech is actually a fairly common comorbidity with adhd"
"> and flashbacks

Hahahahaha"
Seriously
"That, & how telling my own similar story is my way of relating, not trying to one-up or change topics"
"Empathy thru interpretive word-dance!

I do find that the whimsy isn't quite so derailing when I'm with a fellow ADHDer / autistic person"
"That said, it's still something I should work on .."
somehow ..
"just for the sake of actually being heard, rather than being kind of exhausting"
"I find it sooo hard, tho! It's just how I speak, starting all over the place to spiral into my point"
"One positive about this kind of speaking / thinking is being able to connect things that some people may not, tho, like big-picture stuff -- so yes, it has its advantages"
Just needs to be corralled sometimes!
"Okay gotcha, I misread sorry."
"To be fair, the way I said it was not the most intelligible."

"Is it possible to have biological ADHD and still be very sensitive to medication? (Adderall, Vyvanse, etc)"

"I fall under this category, I was diagnosed at 16 and went through school without medication"
"The times I tried adderall etc i felt similarly, like my body was super sensitive and could not process it"
"Even when I got on lexapro at 27 i couldn’t even take a normal dosage, i was on 5mg and had to taper so slowly on and off to not feel like absolute shit"
"I generally do respond very well to herbal supplements though so i’ve been more dependent on those, although i have to buy out of pocket since they’re not insured"
"That makes me feel so much better, knowing I’m not alone"
Thank you
"

What herbal supplements have you found to be the most helpful?"
It depends on what I’m going through life wise so i see my naturopathic doctor occasionally to get check ups on what’s currently deficient
Usually it’s my adrenal glands that struggle due to anxiety/trauma so stuff like holy basil helps a lot with energy and motivation
"I also make sure my B vitamins and magnesium levels are good, since that also affects my overall condition"
Sometimes i do feel like i need something more though lol so i feel what you mean about being cursed

ADHD is so unfair.

I always forget that caffeine even does anything for some people.
😭
Rejection sensitivity is hard for me
"I like to talk a lot about things I'm hyperfixating on or love because I constantly try to learn more about them, and I can tell it gets to a point that I bore who I am talking to or they don't really care at all and it's quite awkward and hurtful, so I resort to not even talking about a lot of the things on my mind"
I can definitely relate to people thinking you're weird
Mid 40s only now realising I might have ADHD
"Everything makes a lot more sense, it’s devastatingly depressing in some ways as I have missed out on life, and destroyed a lot."
Does caffeine not affect everyone with adhd? I got assessed (and told i most likely have it) but caffeine kinda affects me
"It makes me not tired but to doesn’t make me energetic in any capacity, I just don’t feel inclined to sleep or nap"
Yeah I haven’t found the superpower everyone talks about yet.
"Sorry, what's rbp?"
Huh…I see it a bit differently
I think it only becomes unfair when we try to fit ourselves in the box labeled “normal”
I have been living life for a while
You won’t fit
No matter how hard you bend and contort yourself you won’t fit
You’re not made to fit into the box
"I fit into your box, the people on here fit into your box"
I found myself in Afghanistan in 2011 (one of my many career choices)
That experience changed my perception completely
Idk
We have it pretty damn good
Does it annoy me that I laid the tile in the dinning room and kitchen and have literally 3 tiles left that my brain refuses to touch? Does it annoy me that I spent 2 months building a beautiful panino bench for my wife and all I have left to do is attach the legs…yet somehow my brain won’t let me? Yes
So what am I going to do…today I am going to give my best 100% effort
Just today
Tonight I will be happy
Because I have 100%
Some days 100% might be brushing your teeth
Some days you might feel like conquering the world
Huh…I probably just went i circles…lol
I need to get working
So true with staying up
I keep watching random topic related reels each day
"And been doing in even now, the last few days again.And even when I have morning schedules and travel"
So tired and done with this freaking crap.
"What's cruel is when i'm at my best on 54MG concerta xl - i shoot fashion, I work on film sets and write scripts"
Because of some unknown supply chain issues in the UK i've been put on methylphenidate and it's like someone's taken half my brain away.
"yeah, I agree....it seems like I am always saying stupid things and people don't like me and Im like, what did I do?!"
today I had a 1day-in-a-year motivation to clean and make order in the house
"after the third time going back and for because I forgot what I was hanging out the clothes, and trying to do 3 different things and not finishing any, I really wanted to cry . "
"I mean, the suicidal thoughts, addiction, financial problems, increased risk of injury, and early death are probably more unfair..."
lack of impulse control and talking over people without meaning to as well
"In the last couple of years going through some self discovery for other things, as well as finally getting medicated for adhd I was expressing surprise about somone reaching out to me at work as a project was ending to get connected on linked in. 


One of my friends asked if I'm surprised people like me"
"My only response was ""kinda"", as before figuring things out I always felt like my presence was a bother to people."
"Okay, not invalidating, but… at least we have stimulant medication that makes just as awake as coffee :-)"
Sometimes one of the hardest questions to answer is “so what did you do today?” ….
"well… I felt compressed by the weight of the amount of tasks I had to do today that I just went full blown executive dysfunction, accomplishing absolutely nothing and feeling incredibly guilty about it the entire time… but that’s a lot to say so I usually just say “oh ya know, the usual”"
"Please be aware that RSD, or rejection sensitivity dysphoria, is not a syndrome or disorder recognised by any medical authority"
"

Rejection sensitivity dysphoria has not been the subject of any credible peer-reviewed scientific research, nor is it listed in the top two psychiatric diagnostic manuals, the DSM or the ICD"
"It has been propagated solely through blogs and the internet by William Dodson, who coined the term in the context of ADHD"
"Dodson's explanation of these experiences and claims about how to treat it all warrant healthy skepticism.

Here are some scientific articles on ADHD and rejection:

* [Rejection sensitivity and disruption of attention by social threat cues](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2771869/)
* [Justice and rejection sensitivity in children and adolescents with ADHD symptoms](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24878677/)
* [Rejection sensitivity and social outcomes of young adult men with ADHD](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17242422/)

Although r/ADHD's rules strictly disallow discussion of other 'popular science' (aka unproven hypotheses), we find that many, many people identify with the concept of RSD, and we have **not** removed this post"
"We do not want to minimise or downplay your feelings, and many people use RSD as a shorthand for this shared experience of struggling with emotions"
"

However, please consider using the terms 'rejection sensitivity' and 'emotional dysregulation' instead.

"Coffee makes me so sleepy, istg"
My non medicated and sleep deprived ADHD ass depends on caffeine to survive
Its the fuel that keeps me going
"Yeah, it gives me anxiety at high 400mg+ doses, but I got to stay awake for work."
I’m so sorry you experience this too
"Caffeine has never had ANY impact on me regardless of how much I consume (even tested it at over 1,500mg at one time and nothing)"
I’m prescribed adderall at 30mg three times a day and that BARELY helps
I’m currently working with my prescriber to find a combination or alternative that does help
"Every morning is a fight to get out of bed, and every night I’m lucky to get to sleep before 4am"
It fucking sucks and I hate that you or anyone else has to experience this too.
I hear you
I do the same
"I am older, and I have had to accept my weirdness"
"Sometimes, it leads to some great insights and makes life interesting"
The sensitivity issue will mess up my life
"As an example, I retreat from people quite often when I feel I have been dissed.

I would say, enjoy your weirdness"
Many of us appreciate it
Just weigh the sensitivity vs
needing being with people
"Often, they do not mean to hurt us."
"Sadly, I feel your pain"
 I think this all the time
" i’ve had opportunities to deliver hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars in solutions, but can’t seem to ever quite complete anything"
" Getting dressed, brushing my teeth, taking a shower."
all really hard
Yep it is definitely unfair but it is wut it is 🥲
how have i not heard about rbp before 😭😭 it's what i do every single day
If I drink a Monster I will be overcome with severe fatigue
But anything less that 100 mg seems to work a little bit
yeah
"I have friends who will get like 4 hours of sleep and be like ""Let me go quickly drink a coffee"" and come back fully awake, while I can drink 2 cans of Celsius back to back and feel literally nothing."
I thought it was a placebo?? I've drunk those instant coffees that relaxed me but never noticed a perk
"it just feels good having something hot and sweet in the morning, plus they come in different flavours, lol"
"The only thing caffeine does for me is actually help me fall asleep, it’s a stimulant so it makes sense that it’s calm my mind a bit"
Wait coffee is supposed to do something other than taste delicious? I guess it has a slight effect in helping me focus but not enough for me to rely on it.
"I drink coffee in the morning because caffeine withdrawal sucks when you also have TMJ issues…and caffeine helps my random headaches (I use this order to help: ibuprofen, caffeine, alcohol if I am off of work and hubby is near to help with kiddos…some headaches the last one is the only one to help if my TMJ is acting up that day and we have a weather front at the same time)"
I basically decided it is worth the cost of a small coffee a day to not deal with more headaches.
Right? I can’t get to the “wired” state
so weird too because it didn’t do anything for me but if i drink any when im on my meds i get mega wired
I second this
You come off weird bc you just hyperfocus the crap outta a topic.
Yeah it’s so much easier to play out every single variation of a conversation in your head than have to deal with the rejection right 🙃
I feel this so hard
"Earlier today, I went to my daughter's play"
"Afterward, I drove her to her mom's to get her stuff because she's supposed to spend the week with me"
She came back out and asked if she could stay one more day because her step sister was home and she never gets to see her
"Totally reasonable request, and I of course said yes"
Still cried the whole way home.
Oof all of this! I often talk very fast when people ask me about my interests; my mother would often walk away mid conversation out of boredom or just talk over me and change the subject
I’m very distant with my hobbies with most people now
Same
You aren't alone!
We’re still young! Give yourself some time to mourn for the young you who was misunderstood and didn’t realize they had a real reason to feel different than everyone else
"Then move on! 

Forward to bigger and better things with your newfound knowledge! Get treated and figure out what works best for you and you can believe in yourself more than you ever thought possible"
"

Personal experience."
Same
"39M, it took one final nervous breakdown to get me into a psychiatrist's office before I got meds and a subsequent diagnosis"
Still trying to figure out how to un-eff my life.
Yeah you'll have that
"Nowhere to go but forward, comrade"
"Go do what you gotta do, get them meds, take the pressure off for a few hours a day ❤️"
agree
" at least your not 60 like me!  But now I can say ""NO WONDER I did those weird things"""
"Right, found it at 25 and I am crying rivers for my lost academic years"
I could've done so much better with studies had I known this was my issue.
Mid 30’s and discovering the same.
"Caffeine works in part by blocking adenosine activity, which is a neurotransmitter that builds up while we’re awake"
"Its primary function is to make us feel tired and to put us to sleep.

While people with ADHD might not react as strongly to the dopaminergic activity associated with Caffeine, their response to adenosine is probably not any different."
It gives me energy but not awake
"Like if I'm sleep deprived, sure, I'll be able to skip everywhere, but my eyes still eepy."
"Drinking anything hot kinda helps me wake up, but as you said no extra energy"
I think it might just be a morning ritual that my body has kind of gotten used to.
I found throughout my life that caffeine didn't appear to wake me up - but I would crave it
After getting medicated by system didn't appear to need it..
"so I figured (own assessment, not medical) that I was probably self-medicating to a degree.."
feeding the brain something it felt it needed to function.
"Yeah I'm sick of hearing about it.

Some get lucky and land in a work opportunity that gels with their ADHD or have access to wealth meaning less pressure on the ""work life balance"".

The rest of us need to suffer."

Like what I'm doing right now."
"Really appreciate you sharing your understanding, helps me better understand and accept just how my silly brain ticks"
It just makes me anxious lol
There is like no energy benefit.
In college I would fall asleep in class while drinking 20oz energy drinks
"In hindsight, must have been hilarious to watch."
"Whenever folks are like, you should drink coffee, and I'm like.."
"I'm on prescription stimulants, not sure that coffee's really going to do that much"
I've drank coffee and had some of the best sleep.
"I just like the taste, do people really feel energy from drinking it🤔"
My brother is like this
"He sleeps maybe 4-5 hours a night, drinks coffee in the morning, and is all set for the day"
I could slam 16 monsters until I feel my heart palpitating and wouldn’t be able to stay awake even after 8-9 hours of sleep the night before
this is an adhd thing? i just thought i had great caffeine tolerance 😭
😂 the Celsius that’s me too! Two cans and nothing
"Same,coffee never made any effect on me"
"When I drink coffee or drink energy drinks, I get sleepy 😏"
I always assumed people drank it to calm down and help settle
When people described it as 'more energy' or 'more awake' I heard more focused
I drank 6-8 cups a day to help focus
"

I was mid 40s before I learned the truth."
Yes! Same
I can drink a quad espresso and immediately after have the best nap of my life!
It makes me jittery and panic-y
But depends on sleep and mental state
If im well slept its okay
If I didn’t sleep well i get fked.
Yeah :/ I love if people would show some interest too
"It makes me feel really engaged when someone asks questions and is intrigued, it makes me feel heard"
It makes me feel really lonely to be pretty much dismissed by someone because what I have to say is not interesting to them.
WTAF though! Why hasn’t it been picked up before
I mean I will of course wait for a formal diagnosis but it all slots into place
Thank you
That’s a lovely thing to say
It’s fucking hard
We should create a late discovery group and share issues/solutions
exactly
Are you in bed now?
Anxiety isn’t energy??? Fudgggge
"Literally me dropping out of college years ago whilst working at Starbucks lmaooo I'm back now, we're good"
Rejection sensitivity is a complete bitch and a half
You sound a lot like how i am with talking to people
I'm also very perceptive despite the adhd(hurrah life long abuse from shit people and shotty classmates back in the day making me need to be hyper aware of trust) and I can always tell when someone isn't engaged in the convo or doesn't actually care about what I am saying and I can tell when people are just humoring me or straight lying to me
Friendships can be hard for me
especially starting new ones because of this and because it takes a lot of time for me to trust someone fully as well.
I get it!
"I'm 40 and just diagnosed - in my case it partly felt like the stigma and understanding of ADHD when we were kids was that it was a condition ""bad"" kids had, and affected their ability to learn"
"

I was fine in that sense as a kid, but it got harder as I went up the levels at school and the structure/guard rails were removed"
"By the time I was in the workplace I just assumed I was lazy, and had serious imposter syndrome"
"Despite the feedback from my wife and colleagues and my ability/intelligence/whatever, I never believed it or in myself"
"

Getting diagnosed has applied a lens that makes the past make sense"
"I wish I had known sooner, but I'm taking advantage of the knowledge and improvements now and focusing on the future."
"I think for me it is because I'm a woman and did not exhibit the disruptive manifestations of ADHD in school-I was just a ""space cadet"" so to speak"
They actually did test me quite extensively in upper elementary school but no results....Thwn in later years I got just about every other DSM diagnosis possible (I'm exaggerating of course...) but primarily major depressive disorder and anxiety-which yes; I have but I think ADHD is also part of the mix and exasperates the coexisting conditions
"
There are still times I doubt I have it because I didn't fit all the criteria, and my symptoms could just be a result of depressions/CTPSD, but then I look around my house or at my life and it makes a lot of sense...hard to know"
Chicken or the egg kind of situation for me
Because you've never experienced anything else
I'm the same
All of the sudden the pieces started coming together
"A lot of aha moments from then on.

If you're fully functional or it's more ADD, it's likely that it has been dismissed throughout your life."
Even today the medical community is loaded with myths about ADHD
"They knew even less back when you were a child and teenager, especially about the inattentive type"
I’m inattentive and flew completely under the radar as a child
It started getting worse as an adult and still multiple doctors missed it despite the symptoms being right in front of their faces
"I started to suspect and a medical AI, of all things, practically gave me a full evaluation and told me to go to a specialist"
Specialist evaluated me and had no doubt
"

Honestly, there are too many health issues for doctors to catch everything"
At this point they should be bouncing symptom lists off an AI to get a list of possibilities before making a diagnosis
"At least then they can say “maybe it’s X, go see this specialist.” For any doctor today there are X’s which they will miss."
Definitely
The RSD revelation struck me the hardest
It made so many aspects of my life make sense.
It's not??? I've been running on anxiety alone for years
Keeps me going.
I felt this in my soul
I’m sorry
Same here
"A lifetime of abuse and just shitty people has made me extremely aware of peoples behaviour, which isn’t the worst thing in the world b/c now I’m very aware to what they think are subtleties"
"Because of the hyperfocus, I’m paying attn to every single thing they’re saying and doing and quite frankly, it’s helped me avoid a lot of assholes lol"
"

Here’s what I think now that I’m in my 30’s: who gives a shit? You’re an incredible person for having the intellect and interest to pursue what you like"
"Someday, someone will acknowledge this and if there isn’t anyone, that’s ok too"
"Having adhd is a struggle at times, but it’s also a gift that makes you incredibly valuable bc you have the skill set to be interested in things in such great details - this makes who you are"
I’m over fake ppl.
I had rails until this year
"21yr military career, always had a problem with others plans but more than happy to “wing it” even for complex assaults"
The more I read the more it makes sense
Losing my rails has meant my life has imploded over the last year
Like so bad
The fact that adhd is generally diagnosed by how annoying you are to other people than how much it effects your own life is the biggest bs about the whole thing.
Exactly
Several Drs were convinced I have CPTSD
Diagnosed with depression 22yrs ago without any interest taking it further
Catastrophic events over the last 2 years have brought everything that’s “wrong with me” to the fore
"If it wasn’t for all my mum has already lost, I’d jump into traffic right now"
So I have no hope
I’m just waiting for my mum to pass so I can end this fucking torture
"For me, ""losing my rails"" happened when I left school -- where I was top of my class academically but still a total misfit, always chattering, getting out of my seat, clowning around, forgetting shit -- & entered into university"
I couldn't handle it any more
"I suffered through a decade of panic attacks & intense depression, not realising the foundational thing that was ""wrong"" with me / had always been"
"17 years later, & I finally completed my last course needed to graduate this month!

It's hard, realising how much better things could've been if this was recognised & treated early -- not only through medication, but through understanding, acceptance, & healthier coping strategies"
"Many people here go thru a sort of grieving process once they're diagnosed, or at least fully realise what's up -- because although there's that relief of ""it all makes sense now!"", well, there's also the flip side of missed opportunities, fucked up situations, fucked up relationships, etc etc, like, ""oh"
"it really does all make sense now, & I was so powerless to change any of it.""

I've heard that the military life can be good for ADHD people, because of the external structures, the variety, the fact that you need to work well under pressure (including being really good at last-minute / winging it, like me), etc etc .."
"so it could also be that, because of being in that environment where your ""executive functioning"" is pretty much taken care of, it's really fucking hard when you leave.

I'm so grateful to've found this sub, though; I've learned so much more than anywhere else, & I love the kindness, empathy, & even humour that I find here"
"Hope you find the same, plus some practical tips, too.

💚🐨"
"My King, my guy, it could be so so so much worse!  
Let us never forget!  Hope you got a laugh out of this and that today is a good day for you!! I’m old as hayull and figuring it all out"
We got this!
Agree
 I have lost SO MANY JOBS!
I totally understand
"My folks and my dog have kept me alive for a lot more years than I would have been otherwise...
You aren't alone! Hang in there! Maybe finding the right ADHD meds will truly help us both.

How does it manifest for you? If I can ask..."
I feel lucky I went into software/development
"Pretty sure at least half the people I have worked with have ADHD, most diagnosed.

It almost feels like a prerequisite for the career."
Tbh I don’t really know how to explain it
I was in a career with very strict structures for 21 years so I think my symptoms were hidden
"
What’s been weird is that my niche obsession with things actually helped every now and again"
I became utterly obsessed with China and broke I knew it I had a Post Grad qual in diplomacy & IR
"
Now I’ve lost the structure of the job I seem to have gone mad"
I’ve spent sooooo much money on impulsive buys and trips
I seem to be able to switch from being the most empathetic and caring person to being a cold hearted cunt.
Haha same
Interesting
What do you do for work now?
I realised I don’t want a boss so (don’t laugh) I’ve started setting up a dog boarding business.

how do you manage adderall/stimulant hair loss? (female)

I had massive hair loss on adderall
A lot less on vyvanse
"You’re not crazy, it’s definitely a thing."
"I have noticed some stress induced hair loss, but not stimulant"
"However, I have noticed stimulant induced acne that’s unlike any acne I ever had even when I had it bad as a teen"
I read a paper on how stimulants were linked to higher levels of certain androgens which can lead to acne
There is also hormonal hair loss caused by the hormone DHT
"My theory is that if it’s possible for acne, it’s possible for hair loss as well"
"

Long story short, to treat hormonal hair loss you can use topical minoxidil 5% for men (does not matter if you’re a woman as the 5% is much more effective and safe) but you have to use it EVERY DAY"
And it can take 6 months to notice new growth
You hopefully will see the hair loss slow down faster though
"If you’re a woman, you could try a pill called spironolactone, or if you’re a man, finasteride"
"

Ketoconazole shampoo (nizoral makes one OTC) can have a modest benefit, but again you need to use it every day and most people aren’t shampooing their hair every day."
That's a thing?!
needed to hear this lol it will give me some hope!! 🙏 ty
ohhh this is so interesting!! this makes total sense! i am already on spironolactone sadly but i have been looking into minodoxil! i also have some ketoconazole shampoo i was actually given for acne so ill try that! thank you so much :))
it’s listed as a possible side effect! i think the majority of people don’t experience this
Yeah I wonder why it’s not talked about more often
My psych had never even heard about acne from stimulants
I get it from vyvanse but didn’t on Adderall
With the shampoos make sure to leave it on for 2 minutes or so.

Is it safe to take expired adhd medication?

They will be fine
Do not double
At most they may have lost some potency but not enough that you should ever double.
"Yes should be fine, I’ve done it before"
Don’t double up automatically as many medications maintain most of their effectiveness even when expired.
Im pretty sure most medication is fine to take for atleast a couple years
"Some meds will obvious look degraded, and ive even seen some explode from the inside a crystal monster"
"If the pill looks fine, and its only been a couple years should be fine."

The lack of brand Adderall IR has had the most impact for me because almost all of the generics either don't work at all or have minimal effect
 Im also only taking it as a booster to Vyvanse so its not detrimental if I don't have it
"

Just a suggestion, I would look into all the ineffectiveness claims that are out there for the Adderall generics"
After COVID it seems like the manufacturers changed their formulas or used lesser quality ingredients because there has been a marked difference in the last couple of years
" I can personally attest to 3 different generics that have little to no effect on me, compared to one that worked like it was supposed to."
My experience with the shortages started in earnest in February of 2023
"I could get ahold of my prescribed amount of Adderall for a month, then no pharmacy in town had it for two weeks to a month, then back on, then off again"
"This irregular schedule actually resulted in a very jarring and difficult time, which seemed to vastly increase anxiety, depression, brain fog and lethargy.

Since that time, I’ve had friends and family members approach me about my experiences with stimulant medication, to which I have always said that it’s great when it’s reliably available, and resolves so many ADHD issues that it can feel like a new lease on life"
"But when its availability is so irregular, it is very difficult to integrate into life in a healthy way.

I haven’t been on Adderall (or any medical treatment for ADHD) in over a year and the depressing reality of very limited executive function can sometimes be a crushing weight that’s hard to get out from underneath"
It’s like living neck deep in cold molasses
"I’ve managed by altering my life goals and expectations, for now"
"A therapist has helped in this time, but nothing compares to having the tangible psychiatric support that medication provides."
It isn’t a real shortage
It’s the DEA limiting supply to prevent an epidemic due to the influence of social media.
My prescription would sit unmade for weeks until I finally called and told them that I cared far more about having the script than it being the right dosage
"They'd be out of 5mg IR and my script is 5mg IR twice a day, 60 count"
"So I said if you have 10mg, give me 30"
If you have 20mg give me 15
"So now it's not as bad, but I still sometimes wait over a week for it to be filled, which sucks because I can only request a refill after 30 days since my last script"
"So I'm fully out while I wait for it to be filled.

The shortages literally incentivize stockpiling just to make it through."
"Multiple hours each month spent calling pharmacies, waiting on hold, asking if they have my medication in stock, then calling my doctor to tell him which pharmacy to send it to, and hoping he'd do it in time before they filled it for someone else"
"I used to have 3 medications (vyvanse, adderall IR, and adderall ER) because my metabolism burns through them very quickly"
So sometimes I'd have to make trips to three different pharmacies
"You can only refill these meds every 30 days and the doctor has to send in the prescription each time, so I had to make all those phone calls on the exact day I was on your last pill"
"If I didn't find a pharmacy with my medication in stock, it was hugely disruptive to my life"
"Like, ""surprise! Tomorrow, you won't be able to wake up on time, drive safely, do your job well, do any of the tasks you need to do at home (like, for instance calling pharmacies), or get to bed on time!"" And you can't plan for the disruption because you never know if your pills are going to be in stock"
"And it takes WEEKS for be to get back on track after a disruption like that, even if I have my meds"
I'd keep a stash of 5-hour energies (which are NOT cheap) to use when I didn't have my meds
"They don't work as well, but they're better than nothing"
"Sometimes, the pharmacy would only have 20 pills in stock, but you still couldn't fill another script before 30 days had passed, so you'd have to decide: do I keep calling around to see if anyone can fill the entire prescription, or do I get those 20 pills because I might not be able to find it anywhere else, and accept that there will be 10 days this month when I cannot function?

One walgreens pharmacy screwed me over a couple of times in the following way: they'd refuse to tell me if they had my medication in stock unless my doctor sent in the prescription first"
"The other walgreens across town- that would put me on hold for hours and then hang up- did not have this policy, it was just them"
"I'd call my doctor, explain the situation, and have him send over the script"
Then i'd call the walgreens back only for them to tell me they don't have it in stock
"So I'd call around, visit the other walgreens in person so I could actually talk to someone, find a place that has my meds, and have the doctor send over another prescription (you can't transfer prescriptions for controlled substances between pharmacies, the doctor has to write a new one)"
"Only to find out that they can't fill it because the first walgreens has told my insurance provider that they already gave me the medication, so insurance won't allow it to go through for another 30 days"
"Obviously they did NOT give me the medication, because they don't even have it in stock"
They also close early so I have to wait until the next day to call them and have them reverse the insurance claim
"But once that's done, the other pharmacy is out of stock again, for at least another week"
"This happened to me TWICE before I stopped trying to use that walgreens.

Also, the constant pharmacy swapping meant that some pharmacists would accusing me of drug-seeking"
"Yes, I am seeking drugs, I'm trying to find somewhere that has the drugs that my doctor prescribed me so I can function in my day-to-day life"
"My insurance provider and my doctor can tell you i've been on the same regimen for 5+ years.

In the end, my doctor recommended I switch to azstarys"
It's a newer medication that is sort of like a vyvanse version of methylphenidate
"It's new enough that not a lot of people are prescribing it, so it's almost always in stock"
The downside is that most insurance companies don't cover it
"You can get a manufacturer's coupon that brings it down to $100/month, which isn't bad"
"

the 30 day prescription limit is such a huge burden to all of us with ADHD"
"Especially since ""making several phone calls in a timely manner on a specific day once a month and you can't be early or late"" is a task that is laser-targeted directly at our disability"
It's like asking a paraplegic to climb the stairs
I wish there was some sort of way to allow us more leeway
"Perhaps something like, if you've been on the same drug regimen for three years, you are allowed to fill your meds up to a week early, and the doctor can send in three months of prescriptions at a time"
Just something to make it easier
"

It's war-on-drugs bullshit that doesn't help anyone"
"There has never been a single addict whose gone ""well, darn, I couldn't get my fix in a legal way, guess I'll stop being an addict""."
"I went without for over a month, and at first I thought I was okay"
I got very irritable during that time and didn't realize what was going on until I had a bad interaction with a patient and I yelled at my daughter the same evening
Felt like a terrible nurse and terrible dad
Also had an increase in calling out sick due to depression symptoms
"Reached out for help the following day and was able to increase my rx and get back on a few days later, but I did have to pay $300 out of pocket on my credit card in order to get it, because they were out of generic"
I'm just grateful my PCP was willing to help me because my psych has pretty much ghosted me
"I used to take Concerta when I first started meds, but I haven't been able to get ahold of that in over a year unfortunately, despite the fact that it was the med that worked best for me."
"![gif](giphy|NUBp5KcV0PJBe)

I make my own /j"
It’s been difficult on and off
"I usually take extended breaks from my meds, so when there is a shortage I can ration my meds, which obviously isn’t ideal"
"I understand that my medication isn’t like insulin, but executive function is really important to everyday living"
I’m really fortunate to have a life that affords me the ability to take breaks
"The person who is a nurse? Do you want them to go without meds for their executive function long periods of time? 

Back to how it’s personally affected me"
At one point it took months to get my medication
"Even the most flexible schedule, boss, and workplace have their limits"
I felt like a drug addict trying to find a pharmacy that had my meds in stock
"Was I completely worthless? No, but it was easy for those around me to see that I wasn’t balancing work and life well"
It caused a lot of anxiety and as a result I had to go back on anxiety medication.
I have been prescribed Adderall 15mg IR since 2018
"The medication did exactly what it was supposed to do at a consistent, controlled, predictable rate.
It wasn’t until 4-5 months ago when my usual manufacturer of generic adderall switched and immediately things got dicey"
"The “new” medication catapulted me into the stratosphere for 2-3 hours and then unceremoniously dropped
Me back down to earth"
"It sucked.
I changed pharmacies and got another, different manufacturer"
Still 15mg IR
"But this one was even worse; it’s a sleeper than lingers on the periphery of my awareness, barely keeping me awake or allowing me to stay on task.
The sad part is my doctor believes me and wants to help me, he actually knows I require this to function"
"But even he can’t do shit.
Oh and when I called around to see what pharmacies, had what brand, I was met with dead ends since its Schedule II and they can’t tell me.

I still don’t have efficacious medication"
It’s one big old shit sandwich and we’re all taking big bites.
"Initially, I was heavily affected"
"I was having to call several pharmacies in the area to find one who carried my prescription.

The only one was a Walgreens that I’m convinced only had it because they had the absolute worst service in the area"
"I was often standing in line for two hours, only to find it wasn’t ready yet, and would have to move to the back of the line.

I eventually learned that I could get it mail order through my insurance, and that mostly resolved the issue"
"The only issue at that point was convincing my doctor that yes, they would totally do a 90 day prescription through mail order."
"Haven't noticed anything, despite the Netherlands being the first the experience medicine shortages usually due to the fact we are very greedy for a first world country, causing us to be the first country to be cut of in case of a shortage"
"

Luckily I try not to use my Adderall too often"
I really keep it for focus moments.
There was a time like a year ago I’d have a delay for up to a week
But I haven’t had any issues for almost a year now getting my adderall ir filled when I need it.
Have no issues refilling mine in CA.
I had the opposite experience
I was taking Focalin for a while
"but it became unavailable, so I switched to Adderall with no supply issues"
Then I stopped taking both and went to Strattera
"Isn't the ""shortage"" over for the most part?"
I have had no issues at all getting my meds.
"Generics and brand name do not work in the slightest anymore, tried TEVA, Mallinckdrodt, Shire, Sandoz, all at different dosages like 10mg 20mg 30mg"
"Nothing works anymore, I don’t even get the bad side effects like dry mouth, let alone the good ones"
I used to know when it kicked in because I would get into a euphoric state and then start studying
Now I catch myself rereading the same thing over and over again because these are sugar pills
"I took like a 100mg one day just to see if there’s even any stimulant in them, absolutely nothing happened"
"And no it’s not a tolerance issues, because I took a huge break before trying it again."
It takes me 2 weeks each time to refill my meds
"I had just switched to vyvanse so it’s hard for me to tell if each new dose is working properly before I have to wait ANOTHER 2 weeks to get a refill (because of the shortage, this is my average wait)"
Fuck American health care
I was on a 6 week wait and finally was able to snag some two days ago
I forgot to take it today and honestly I don’t feel any different today than I did yesterday when taking it
I truly don’t think it even does anything for me.
"I’m very grateful that I’ve only experienced this a handful of times in the past 2ish years of being diagnosed and prescribed! When I’d call around all Walgreens in the area, they didnt have any either"
"I switched to Jewel-Osco (from IL) and have never had an issue! Always try Costco, Sam’s club, hospitals have pharmacies anyone can utilize, and I recently learned about Amazon prescription ordering but haven’t tried myself, so not sure if they experience shortages"
"

Edit: I’m on 25 mg ER but not the name brand"
Haven’t had any issues in north Texas getting mine filled
Switched to concerta
[deleted]
"It has not, because Australia makes its own dexamphetamine."
"I can’t get Adderall XR right now, and two months ago I couldn’t get IR"
I can’t keep going back and forth
I now have two months worth of IR even though it makes me more irritable and cranky than the XR
I only have enough to take my full dose SOME days
It’s making me think I need to succumb to my poor working memory and complete and total lack of motivation because we all know where this is heading
It won’t be long before it’s not available at all.
"Honestly, positively"
They switched me to vyvanse which is way better
I had no clue that adderall was effecting me so negatively
I was dependant and would have withdrawals
I was tired 24/7 to the point where I thought I had a sleep disorder
I can actually function off of vyvanse. 
The shortages have impacted me in multiple ways
I have been far more fortunate with being able to get it consistently but when I haven't been able to
It's been really difficult
I also have narcolepsy on top of ADHD so it's not just like...I can't function and keep track of things
I literally can not stay awake or drive without my medication
"

It's made it a BIG deal if I ever drop one pill in the sink when I put them in my daily pill box"
"Thankfully I have been hypervigilant about this but shit happens.

Calling in my prescription used to be a no big deal task but now every month there are a few days where I'm holding my breath and trying to ration my meds until I see that it's being processed."
I got mine refilled a week ago with no issues

"I may have come off as a little dramatic, it’s very frustrating when the medication that allows you to function stops"
"But if that’s the worst part of my life, it’s not a bad life."
"I’m in Ohio, about an hour south east of Cleveland"
I’ve never experienced an Adderall shortage personally
But when I was on Vyvanse it was constant.
"Yeah, i have to copay to see my dr who prescribes them and with concerta i just telehealth zoom meeting with a nurse practitioner who just runs it hy the psychiatrist and then they send it over to the pharmacy"
I didn't even need a referral
its just i changed apartments so i changed my pcp and she needed a referral and siggested this psych clinic i get concerta from
"I gave them permission to collect my med recs of when i was seeing a psych as a kid fir my meds, just had to sign and fax a form with the years i was being tewated and my old psychs name"
Which took me a while to work up to but i got em
He prescribed concerta first so we agreed to try that instead
Before i would have to drive forever to old pcp office
Just to tell him i only needed a refill
I listens to my chest for a second maybe two
"Then he jusy fill the scrip and i leave, and i paid him fir that"
"I still have to zoom the np when i need a refill but its entirely insured, id only have to pay for in office visits"
"Last adderall scrip i got i had to call him a couple times to change the pharmacy since the closest to me didnt hav any, nor the next one closest"
"Then the last had only 20, so if i got my scrip there, id be surrendering 10"
I cant get the rest elsewhere or pick them up later when they get more
Only one time filling of the script.
Will do :)
Totally understand!
"OK, thank you!"
"Thanks for sharing, best wishes!"

I am crashing even with two extended release doses

I got some really good advice today I think might help you
"I know, all TOO well, the emotions you're dealing with"
"I've been called over-emotional my entire life, and dealing with the sting of that feels like a knife to the chest"
"But regular people don't get that, and never will"
"They try, and, if you're lucky like me, you find your folks who know how to treat you right without treating you with kid's gloves"
"

My best advice, and the advice I got today, is to sit with your emotions"
Feel them
Learn from them
You have the power to do absolutely anything you want to do if you learn how to accept yourself
"

It's going to hurt"
That's ok
Let it
Because it ***will*** feel better
You have survived it before and will survive it again
Becoming comfortable with the uncomfortable is the only way to get through this
"And just remember, for every person you think is laughing at you, there are 100 more on this sub cheering you on, because we've all been in your place."
Maybe besides adhd you’ve social anxiety and or avpd?
"Please be aware that RSD, or rejection sensitivity dysphoria, is not a syndrome or disorder recognised by any medical authority"
"

Rejection sensitivity dysphoria has not been the subject of any credible peer-reviewed scientific research, nor is it listed in the top two psychiatric diagnostic manuals, the DSM or the ICD"
"It has been propagated solely through blogs and the internet by William Dodson, who coined the term in the context of ADHD"
"Dodson's explanation of these experiences and claims about how to treat it all warrant healthy skepticism.

Here are some scientific articles on ADHD and rejection:

* [Rejection sensitivity and disruption of attention by social threat cues](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2771869/)
* [Justice and rejection sensitivity in children and adolescents with ADHD symptoms](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24878677/)
* [Rejection sensitivity and social outcomes of young adult men with ADHD](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17242422/)

Although r/ADHD's rules strictly disallow discussion of other 'popular science' (aka unproven hypotheses), we find that many, many people identify with the concept of RSD, and we have **not** removed this post"
"We do not want to minimise or downplay your feelings, and many people use RSD as a shorthand for this shared experience of struggling with emotions"
"

However, please consider using the terms 'rejection sensitivity' and 'emotional dysregulation' instead.

"those are the best things ive found but i would like to find something more productive.
on the other hand, i think part of it is that i want something “productive” to do when i am trying to relax, and i think i should try to work on being able to feel like i can take time to relax without “accomplishing” anything, if that makes sense"

If I’m being honest the examples you’ve mentioned seem quite mild and could be on the spectrum of normal
ADHD symptoms are experienced by people without ADHD but with less intensity and frequency
For someone to get a diagnosis of ADHD it has to significantly impair their life
If you feel your symptoms meet the criteria then speak to a doctor who specializes in ADHD and let them decide. 
Always worth going to a professional
"As someone who's been diagnosed as a child, and again as an adult professionally I roll my eyes at self diagnosed people as everyone and their mother appanretly has ADHD now, but very few are professionally diagnosed and it trivializes the disorder."
I’m in the same boat
Started cruising this sub today
I don’t want to be one of those that throws ADHD around casually like people say they have OCD when they don’t
"However, the more I look into it the more I think it’s a legitimate possibility"
I’m contemplating seeking a professional opinion
A little nerve racking to be honest.
Maybe start reading into the topic at adxs.org; there are also quite extensive tests
This Homepage in general helped me tremendously
"I fell into this ""Everybody has ADHD"" feedback loop where I didn't look into it"
Got prescribed antipsychotics when I told a doctor about how I repeat the same song lyric or movie quote in my head all day and can't stop it
" Told my other doc that of course I'm never manic or hyperactive, externally I'm very stoic"
" I discovered inattentive type adhd and was like ""holy shit this is everything and I'm not alone""  

I got diagnosed / medicated super late and I'm PISSSSSSED I didn't know this sooner"
 What have you got to lose?
"I appreciate this honest reply and although it might seem silly, first seeking a bit more information from a community like this seems like a reasonable step before scheduling appointments which cost actual money, so I do value your input greatly"
"As someone who suffers from legit insomnia, I can relate how frustrating that is, especially the self diagnosis from people that don’t understand what insomnia truly is

So likewise, I am not self diagnosing myself or think it’s “cool” to say I have ADHD"
"I never thought I did, but I am legitimately wondering if I should seek a professional consultation or if I’m just overthinking common experiences."
Yea for me it was the pointing out that it’s not normal to have difficulty concentrating to people talking
I just thought “maybe most people are just uninteresting” I didn’t realize people actually enjoy talking with each other even about uninteresting things.
Do not visit adhx.org
Very NSFW!
"Thank you will look into that for sure, will google it so I get to the correct site lol"
Inattentive ADHD is the one that sticks out to me the most
"Everything I read about it is like yes, thats what I experience"
"

The only worry I have is taking medications that might not be good for me if I don’t truly have ADHD.

How would you say you’ve improved since seeking treatment?"
"100% it's really frustrating when people self diagnose, as if medical professionals don't study for years to diagnose and treat these conditions.

I don't know where you live so I'm not sure what access to healthcare you have, but a few simple tests done by a psychologist, or psychiatrist or a doctor usually can pin point a diagnosis"
"It's worth it if you think you may, if you do get diagnosed, treatment can change your life for the better significantly."
Oh geez if you also have insomnia too you should definitely get tested
Sleep problems and ADHD are best buddies.
"Oh wow i am sorry, should read adxs.org 🙈🙈🙈"
"I would say if what I experience is an actual condition and not just me being slightly odd, it would be greatly beneficial if I didn’t have to experience some of these things.

It’s really hard to maintain friendships when it’s just so difficult to pay attention or be interested in what they are saying"
"I don’t enjoy feeling that way, so I do my best to show them I care by listening as best as I can, but it’s never “genuine” so it never truly works.

Career wise, I work in tech"
It’s very difficult for me to study more advanced stuff because I know I’ll just end up forgetting unless I spend days repeatedly studying the same material over and over again
Even though I perfectly understand it while I’m learning it
"So this holds me back from seeking more demanding roles with better pay.

So if this is related to undiagnosed ADHD, I would certainly benefit if treatment actually exists"
Otherwise I’ll just continue as I always have - I’m just an odd guy with a shit memory.

Apparently it's an unpopular opinion but I didn't care for Vyvanse and ended up going back to Adderall XR and I'm liking it so much more
 Vyvanse was definitely a smoother effect but it took way too long to kick in and the appetite suppressant effect lasted way too late into the evening
 I also felt like I was crawling out of my skin on days I didn't take the Vyvanse
 Everybody is different though.
Adderall IR had me behaving like an addict
It also turned me into a chain smoker and worsened my binge drinking
Vyvanse is so much better for me but you must find the right dosage.
"I love vyvanse! It definitely has a smoother effect, with adderall I can feel the come up and come down but with vyvanse it’s not as immediately obvious that it’s working but it does work wonders for me"
Adderall was great and still remains great for me if I already have motivation to get stuff done
It gives me a huge boost and I can much more easily focus on the tasks at hand and actually accomplish much more
"The problem with adderall for me is that if I’m not already motivated, it does nothing for my motivation, I just hyper focus on the wrong things instead"
Vyvanse actually gets me over the hump of lack of motivation to do anything
Also it doesn’t really wear off for me like adderall does
Adderall works for a few hours and then the effects are gone for me
"Leading to things being not great for me after it wears off, like driving"
Vyvanse seems to build up in my system or at least not wear off quickly and I notice that I am just in general better at doing things like driving and not being impulsive
I’ll even notice the effects if I don’t take my meds for a day
It’s not an immediate on and off switch and seems to have a much broader effect
It’s literally life changing for me where adderall was just more like a booster.
For me Vyvanse never helped with my low motivation in the way that Adderall does
It gave me energy but no desire to actually do anything
Adderall is way better for me in this regard.
I’m meeting with my doctor next week to try and make this same change
Adderall seems less and less effective every week and I feel like is starting to alter my mood negatively
Hoping I have better results on Vyvanse that last
Vyvanse makes me really depressed when its wearing off
Vyvanse is the only thing I haven't tried
Adderall made me sleepy
I could take it at 730 and then read and go to sleep
The Ritalin  seemed to do absolutely nothing but feel l8ke I had to much coffee
Now I'm on Concerta and feel sleepy again
So frustrating
 I think you have to try it and see for yourself because our brains are wired so differently.
This isn't a direct answer to your response but does include Vyvanse and my overall experience on my journey to find the right combo
"I'm a huge advocate for Azstarys, unfortunately a lot of insurance seems to not cover it although there is a rx card available but I'm not sure what pricing with that is"
"
Adderall was no good for me cause all kinds of different issues, I was also metabolizing it too quickly , XR would only last roughly 6 hours and I'd have to take up to 2 5mg irs for the afternoon/evening, as someone else said it almost makes feel like an addict along with a terrible daily crash"
Vyvanse caused severe mood swings/instability in the afternoon
Wellbutrin made me tired all the time
Strattera caused anger issues
I stopped all meds for a year and have now been on Azstarys for 10 months
"I have no crash, it literally lasts all day roughly 12+ hours"
No come down side effects
"I literally just feel myself within 30-45 min of taking it, some days it literally feels like parts of my brain rewired itself back to normal ( only way I know how to describe it lol)"
My daughter is on it as well and has been for roughly 10 months as well
"She just made honor roll for the first time, which furthers my advocating for Azstarys, I know every med is different person to person though."
Vyvanse is so much better in my experience
I missed the high/productivity of adderall but the come downs were life ruining
I dont have a bad comedown on vyvanse
But my psych prescribed me a booster of adderall again after the vyvanse wears off and its already fucking me up 
Vynase worked well for me but I ended up switching back because 70mg kept me up all night and 60 was impossible to get
"I like being able to pop some IR adderall if I need it, but it doesn’t work as well"
"I much prefer adderall to Vyvanse, personally"
I didn't like how long it took for Vyvanse to kick in
I also just didn't feel as much of an effect from it
I struggled with my attention even on the highest FDA-approved dose.
I took 60mg Vyvanse for over 5 years
"It turned me into a raging bitch in the evening when I would crash with a migraine, but for some reason I never put two and two together until I got a boyfriend that called it out"
"I also felt like I NEEDED drugs, alcohol and sex simultaneously"
Adderall IR is much better for me
I have some sense of control now
I didn't like being locked into 8+ hours of hit-or-miss focus before.
Agreed! I was the grumpiest grump on Adderall
My misphonia went off the charts and I felt angry all the time
Vyvanse - these problems went away but I still get a comparable number of hours per day where I'm on the ball and not mostly useless.
It’s a no from me dog. 
I'm going to talk to my psych about trying vyvanse
I currently am on Dexedrine xr and a booster and its worn off after 7 hours..
im hopeful vyvanse will last at least that time frame without a booster.
Vyvanse all the way
Adderal gave me a short burst and a bad crash
Vyvanse begins to peak for me at about 2 hours and lasts 8-10
Little to no crash
And my sleep is way better.
Depression
That was my experience
Your mileage may vary.
"XR is nice, almost heavenly"
"Vyvanse turned me into a straight-edge, high on life superhero.

Definitely my favorite, but my insurance didn’t cover it, so XR works"
"The latter made me hyper productive, but also talkative and overbearing"
"I prefer Vyvanse to Adderall, tbh"
 Or the XR Adderall
" I’m prescribed 10mg 2x per day (or am when I’m under care), which is perfect for me if I don’t want to go to sleep until 2am (the afternoon dose keeps me up, but lowering my dose to 10mg 1/day has me burning out around 3pm and 5mg 2x/day doesn’t work), and taking any more than 15mg at a time is too much and the IR doesn’t last long enough to get me through a workday).

Vyvance spread that equivalent 20mg of Adderall out across the day perfectly"
" As long as I took it right when I woke up at 6:15, my brain was “in business” when I got to work at 9:00, didn’t make me feel like I was dying out by 3:00, and didn’t keep me up all night."
vyvanse gave me an irregular heartbeat...so that didn't work so well
Vyvance is way fucking better
I switched about a month ago actually
It lasts longer and doesn't feel intense as adderall
I do notice my motivation is good but isn't necessarily the same as Adderall
"Also, no side effects in my experience"
One downside is that it's very expensive for me - $30 co pay
I think going back and forth every couple years doesn’t hurt ime
"Idk about Vyvanse (not formulary for my insurance), but im on Dexedrine for two years now, and it’s just brilliant"
(Vyvanse is a pro-drug of Dexedrine). 
Vyvanse works way better for me
It kept me on task and focused for the majority of the day
I typically had very little issue getting work and housework done during the day
Vyvanse also worked more consistently for me
It also made me incredibly tense and easily irritated
"I had to be very careful when I took it or else it would keep me up at night, so if I forgot to take it in time I was basically screwed for either the day or the night depending on if I decided to take it late or not"
"I learned the hard way that Vyvanse and caffeine did not mix well for me and hurled me into panic attacks a couple of times.

Adderall keeps me focused on tasks but also makes me feel more positive and elevates my mood"
I like that it kicks in relatively quicker compared to Vyvanse so there's more wiggle room on what time I take it during the day
"Adderall has been inconsistent for me tho, and is largely dependent on how much sleep I get and what I eat during the day, an issue I didn't experience too heavily with Vyvanse"
"It also doesn't last nearly as long (both IR and XR) and it gives me very limited productivity time during the day.

Currently I take (generic) Adderall, but I'm toying with the idea of trying Vyvanse again in the future"
Idk which I would say I prefer
I might give Adderall a slight edge due to the mood issues I had with Vyvanse.
I was on 30mg Vyvanse but it became less effective
I’ve had surgery on my digestive tract so my dr wanted me to give Adderall immediate release a two week trial so I could take a second dose mid day
"(Were thinking maybe I’m not absorbing meds like most people) 

I don’t like it, unfortunately"
"I much prefer Vyvanse and hopefully I can either up my dose of it, or try something similar to it"
"

I hope you have good luck with it!"
"vyvanse unfortunately did nothing for me, and when it did, i only noticed a difference for about an hour."
"I found it not to work for extended periods very well for me and on high doses 70mg I was high as a MFer for 3 hours in the morning, I am now on 100mg a day and I split it up into 5 20mg doses and take it every 3 hours and it works great I get coverage for the entire day like 15hours and no crash in the evening"
I started taking 5mg Adderall 2 times per day
Few days later it was increased to 3 times
"My first dose lasts 2.5-3 hours, first 1.5-2h"
"Its barely possible to cover work for me, then I’m unmedicated for the rest of the day"
" While i was medicated I felt mostly better than when I wasn’t but I frequently had agitation, anxious feelings in my heart"
I got 2 panic attacks during month (I don’t have them at all normally)
I also live on 3rd floor without elevator
Everytime I climbed the starts I got uncomfortably increased hr and bp
"All of it with protein diet, enough sleep, snacks, electrolytes and magnesium (crashes were so bad first days so I started googling wth was going on)"
Positive effects were very beneficial but not enough
"I still couldn’t focus, listen and read (but I didn’t feel mentally exhausted 100% of time, much less procrastinated, it was so much easier to start doing something than without it, also mentally calmer despite physical anxiety)"
But side effects were strong enough even on such low dose
I tried 10 mg 2 times
Upsides weren’t so much better but downsides were
Even length was the same but start and finish felt even more abrupt
"
I discussed vyvanse with doctor"
She prescribed me 40mg
So far it’s 2nd day and I really feel the difference
It’s much stronger effect without any of those downsides
It also lasts at least 6 hours
Or maybe 8
"I don’t know, it falls off so slow and smooth that I can’t say if it’s ended or not"
Start is pretty abrupt for me unlike what other people say
It kicks me almost as fast as adderall - ~1 hour
At day one first 2 hours felt like I was a little bit high but I had it on adderall
After those 2 hours I started feeling absolutely normal and peaceful until almost the end of the day
At day 2 I didn’t even feel those first 2 hours
"
Biggest difference for me is that I’m on much higher effective dose than on adderall (like 5mg is not even therapeutic for most of people but some side effects were a little bit too much for me while 40mg of vyvanse is too much for lots of people - I see they start from 20mg and can’t go higher while 40-50 is most popular range) but I don’t even feel how it works"
I’m not even sure if it works or not until it completely wears off at the end of the day - then I realize that it worked all that time 😂 I’m sure that’s how it’s supposed to be - feeling NATURAL and normal
Not like it was on adderall with those emotional wheels when it abruptly kicks after 1 hour then abruptly ends in few hours so I need to chase those tabs for the whole day
It’s the worst when I needed to work 8am-7pm because I needed to adjust dose in such way so I would be medicated for most of work time (not even all of it) while being unmedicated during breaks and least loaded time because it lasted so short and it feels when it ends
"
My verdict - vyvanse works way better for me"
I think we will increase the dose in a month as I don’t feel attentive and focused enough at 40mg but I still need to get used to it before going up
Also I feel like I’m pretty close to *my* dose.
I similarly prefer Adderall XR to Vyvanse
" Unfortunately Vyvanse did very little positive for me.Adderall is the only thing that’s been able to get me to the right place with every factor, with no side effects."
"Damn you got appetite suppression from it? All it’s doing for me is making it slightly easier to take control of executive function (but not finish tasks, that would require focus for longer than 5 minutes)"
"All good, that’s why we have different options"
"I’ll have to see about the crawling out of your skin, hopefully side effects minimal"
"Biggest thing for me is being able to get the RIGHT things done, last few months I’ve been good not feeling depressed or anything at all but I just find myself doing everything but what I want/need to do and that’s the freakin reason I’m taking adderall in the first place, that extra push to get the mouse spinning 😂"
Somehow I’ve managed to quit smoking after 30 years (over a year now) but I can relate to the chain smoking
I do find myself having more drinks at night to take that adderall edge off so this info is super helpful
"I do not like drinking 4 or 5 days a week, even if it’s just 1 or 2 drinks."
For me Adderall is perfect as far as its therapeutic value with no negative side effects or euphoria
Just a calm focus that helps me keep my emotions and racing thoughts from taking over
"

Focalin was the one that felt like more of a rush and crash"
Not as much therapeutic value.
The binge drinking part fascinates me
I noticed the handful of times I decided to drink while on my medication I went HARD
A beer came a six pack
A shooter became a pint
Very strange.
Same it turned me into someone who was completely dependent on it to be functional. 
Your insight is music to my ears
The hyper focus on wrong things and not being able to help me motivate myself unless I’m already hyped up is exactly the problems I’ve experienced and thought it was just me or my body needing a higher dosage
"

I’m about 5 hours into the 70mg dose and I feel focused, motivated but not jittery or wanting to fixate on stupid shit"
"Think I’m sold on it, it’s just a bit pricier."
Just started on adderall and finding it to have mixed results
I echo all of these sentiments and then seem
I am actually able to sleep on Vyvanse
"When I was on Adderall, I could not sleep and had to be prescribed sleeping meds"
I didn’t care for it
Not to mention I also grinded my teeth at night really bad
"Switching to Vyvanse was a complete 180, but I agree, you have to find the right dosage."
Same!!! Looking to make the switch back to adderall for this reason.
"Just to confirm, are you talking about Adzenys (dissolvable tablet)? If so, I took that once during the adderall shortage and also preferred it as it did kick in much sooner than adderall and barely felt any crash"
"But even with my insurance it was $75 for the copay, but almost worth it in my opinion!"
This is kind of why I'm thinking about asking to try Vyvanse
"When I was in school (20 years ago) I was on 20mg XTR and I remember coming down feeling like I was dying, empty, depressed, just a shell of a husk of a human"
I just fairly recently got re-diagnosed so I've been trying to get dosage right and low dosage was fine at first but it just wasn't enough after a month or so
Now I'm doing 10 mg in the morning and 5 in the afternoon which has helped but I'm also feeling that void at the end of the day again
It's not as bad as back then but it does feel like all my happiness has been sucked out.
This gives me hope because right now I'm doing 10 in the morning and 5 in the afternoon
The 5 kind of helps but more than anything it's just to put the crash off until around 5pm.
Does Adderall give you the 'get up and go' feeling? Does it help you get your tasks done? Can you compare your experience with Adderall and Vyvanse please?
"Is the come up, come down and after effects worth the time feeling therapeutic?"
"No , I've actually never heard of that one 😅 Azstarys is the name, it's a capsule similar to Vyvanse and Adderall  XR"
The active ingredients are Serdexmethylphenidate/dexmethylphenidate
Yeah I know this one is upwards over a grand apparently with no insurance according to one of the pharmacies that stopped carrying it due to companies not paying
it has only been on the market for 3 years now
Thankfully my copay is only $35.
"I just switched from Vyvanse to Adderall, I liked Vyvanse up until 60mg"
"I had intermittent times under late afternoon stress at work I was trying to muddle through, rather than script a boost, doc switched me over to a combo of IR and ER Adderall"
"

I was taking the Vyvanse very early, before I got out of bed"
"Worked great, really no issues other than the first few weeks of not eating and drinking well"
And that other issue above occasionally
"Then 60mgs came along, and I felt like hell, totally discombobulated"
"

The Adderall is working good, I like the option of dosing how I see fit, when I want, how I want"
"I flipped the original plan, I take IR in the early morning now and ER later, covers me until I go to bed"
"Tomorrow I will sleep in, and probably just take the ER for the day, not much going on except for a hike"
"

Best of luck to you!"
"I don't feel a pronounced shift when Adderall wears off, in fact its therapeutic effects last into the night and beyond"
"Even when I had to go into withdrawals a few times it wasn't that bad, and once I took another dose it's like I could get back to myself"
"Granted, that morning dose feels great those first few hours, and that's when I have to prioritize everything I procrastinate with, otherwise it won't get done"
"In the evening my mind may still be quiet but my hyperactivity and loss of focus do come back late in the night, but luckily that's when I'm in bed anyway so I can just sleep it off."
"can you ellaborate the come up, come down and side effects? I'm trying vyvanse rn but it's not working"
I'm considering if I should try adderall?
"Oh okay, I may have to look into that one and I am glad that seems to work for you and your daughter"
"Dealing every month with adderall shortages, which lately has been for the XR, is just no fun!"
That’s a good way to describe it
Ty
Psycho naut wiki
"It really isn't any fun at all, it was a struggle every month between the Adderall and Vyvanse at one point for my daughter"
I have yet to have issues with the azstarys
I will say Alot of doctors still have no idea about this med
My son is actually just starting the lowest dosage now after his primary did research and initially wasn't going to prescribe as she never heard of it until I mentioned it
"
He tried guanfacine but all that did was make him tired and actually worsened symptoms, and knowing the track record with other meds I advocated to try this next for him to limit the potential of going through a bunch of meds that we already know didn't work to well with our genes"
"One doctor there even said no one there will prescribe it without basically testing every other med first and we're going to make us wait another 2 months until he could see a psychiatrist , the system is very backwards."

"Oh, commenting to add – my insurance did not want to cover it, but there is a good RX coupon that covers the generic."
Is it a stimulant like atteral or something else?
"I think it's a non stimulant, I am curious as to how it works , and what it feels like."
Same
Im ready ti make a change
"As far as I'm aware, it's a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor"
"That said, if I understand correctly it's extremely selective, whereas antidepressants use this same mechanism with far less selectivity"
"Which to send the point home, when it was developed if I remember correctly it was intended as an antidepressant"
"What they found was that it failed as an antidepressant, but was helpful in some cases with ADHD.


I've been on it myself for around a month and a half now and based on reading others posts and looking at the side effects list, it seems it can vary drastically in effect from person to person"
It had a big effect on me in the first few days and then became a lot less noticable after that
"I just started on 80 mg yesterday, and the changes from 40mg - 60mg and 60 - 80mg have been far more subtle than when I started"
After the first few days though it also seemed a lot more hit and miss in dosage
"I think it's getting more consistent at higher doses for me, but it's hard to say at this point. 


The main warning I'd give is the first couple weeks might be rough, based on reading here it sounds like having a positive effect in the first few days is rare, and even then it doesn't work for everyone."
You take it every day so it’s constantly in your system
I just feel calm and focused over all
I have ADHDi (inattentive) Hope this helps.
It’s not a stimulant- it’s an SNRI specifically for adults with ADHD
:-) I’d never been on stimulants so my psych wanted to try this.

Does the phrase “just try not to get distracted” and others like it evoke rage in you as well?

"It brings out the beast, especially when it is said by my Mum and Dad but they don't even attempt to soften the blow by suggesting the ""Just try"" part"
Their methods are a little more..
"Demanding and ignorant, including but not limited to ""You NEED to only do one thing at a time"", YOUR problem is [insert an opinion they're convinced is a fact],  ""DON'T leave things to the last minute, Get up and do them straight away""
""You need to focus on one thing and one thing only"""
"
It was even worse when I was in addiction, ""Just stop, I don't know why it's so hard for you to just stop"", ""Say no, it's that easy""."
"meanwhile they both had and still have a gambling problem...
A year ago I would have torn shreds off them but a shit load of therapy and studying 2 separate degrees, one in Criminology and the other in Psychotherapy has me in a deeper understanding of the ""why"" in relation to different people and different behaviors"
It still annoys me but instead of going into defense mode I just answer their questions with a question that shifts their thinking back onto themselves
Yes
"I am going to be distracted, full stop"
The question is simply how will I manage it
This is why I always fought to be allowed to draw in class: the best way I knew to not be distracted in a bad way was to preemptively put in place a distraction that had a minimal chance of derailing what I wanter to do - i.e
engaging my eyes and hands in something else while I listened.
I would reply..
"

 ""I'm sorry I was distracted, can you repeat that?""

Every time."
"Especially, when they say, try to be mindful or practice mindfulness crap"
Just try! Ahhhh! My husband says this to our youngest - also ADHD - all the time
The rage it causes… like wtf?!?! He IS trying! All the damn time!
When people treat me like it's a personality flaw that I forget things.
Yes
My parents say it All
The
Time
"(Neither have ADHD, I'm 17F.) I hate it because nobody seems to understand that I just can't help it"
"Getting distracted or losing focus isn't a choice, it's completely unavoidable"
"It makes getting things done take forever and it's even more frustrating when they tell you to do something that you can't do.

  
I can just imagine how satisfying it would be, if for one day, they had ADHD"
Maybe they'd finally understand how insufferable it is.
I’m sorry but “pilot this sack of meat” absolutely sent me 😂
Kinda
"I wish I could say it changes, but it doesn't"
At least not for my mom it doesn't
"I'm 44, nearly 45 and she still says that same crap to me, its infuriating cause I've explained adhd to her multiple times and why I am like I am and why I struggle and she just doesn't quite get it."
"If it was important, you would remember."
I love your closing dig! Definitely saving that.
Oh fuck that.  Why tf do I need to longingly hold your gaze to confirm I'm talking to you? A quick refresh of eye contact every now and then is enough
I'm fuckin' thinking here.
Exactly!! My teachers used to give in and let me read because they knew i was still absorbing
My favorite teacher ever used to let me sleep in the back of my Bio class because my Adderall was usually knocking me out by then
"He would place the work on my desk, knock twice, and I would do the assignment and turn it in before all the other kids, then go back to sleep"
I dont think I ever hit below a 97 and my grade average was at a 120% for a few months because I was doing extra credit work he didnt tell me I didnt have to
"Once you find your system, and people who understand and respect your brain, it works great"
I just dont have that anymore.
Those are only helpful for anxiety and not making an enemy of yourself
Not helpful for being less ADHD.
My mother claims she has ADHD
She read countless books and studies about it
"She educated herself well, but i still dont know where the goddamn disconnect is."
I have to actively remind people im listening
Its horrible.
And other comorbid conditions

"Try to leave 2 days preferably off elvanse before switching, I get ear ringing and slight pain if I switch to methylphenidate after less than 24 hours from elvanse 
From my experience Elvanse is much better than Ritalin and concerta but you tend to not move from bed if you’re exhausted on elvanse.
Basically it’s much better for me but it’s much more effected by diet, sleep, lifestyle but people are very different so you wouldn’t know unless you try"

"The school environment, is hell for kids with ADHD sometimes"
"It’s bland, under stimulating, and generally awful 🤣

Before you go into a meeting, write down specifically what you know works at home and take it with you"
"If standing works, then they need to help you translate standing into the classroom etc"
"However don’t expect the school to make accommodations that are too far, sometimes we do stuff at home that doesn’t translate well"
"If your child focuses best when they can stand on their head or be destructive, be prepared for that to get shot down"
"

If you go into a meeting you need to ask them specifically what academic behavior they would like to address and try to take it in smaller pieces"
"This is another instance where if you have specific things you would like to see improved, write them down and take them with you"
"Teachers focus sometimes less on strengths your child does possess, and more on classroom management"
"If your kid is being “disruptive”, or “not turning their work in” address these things specifically with specific accommodations"
Try to avoid vague accommodations that you won’t be able to measure and your child won’t be able to implement
"If your child cannot understand what is expected of them, this is not going to be successful"
"A 6 year old shouldn’t be in charge of when they get to turn their homework in, you should"
"If you need extended deadlines, you need to be aware of that and know your little man’s limitations"
It’s little things like this that can balance your home life vs school and make everyone happier
"

Make sure you have some sense of realism as well, there are aspects of school that are not going to be perfect"
"All the counseling, dietary changes, and accommodations in the world are not going to change the fact your child has ADHD"
"I know you probably know that, but weirdly enough some people don’t 🤣"
I'm a former kindergarten teacher with experience teaching kids with ADHD
"It's a little bit of a different enviornment from 1st grade, but maybe some of my experiences might help you figure out some ideas for accommodations"
"

>he doesn't finish tasks

This is a general problem for kids with ADHD"
The first step is to make sure your child actually understands the assignment
"Kids with ADHD have a hard time keeping track of directions, and they sometimes don't actually know what they are supposed to be doing"
"On top of that, they are sometimes behind academically because they mentally miss instruction time or they don't have sufficient practice"
"My tips:

- Request that someone, preferably someone other than the classroom teacher like the special ed teacher, test your child's academic knowledge as a part of your child's IEP testing"
"This should include testing in reading, writing, math, and phonics"
"Kids can be behind in 1st grade, and any deficites have to be recorded properly"
"If your child is behind in a core subject area, they need teir 3 intervention services to help them catch up.
- Request a visual schedule be put in a place visible to your child, like on their desk"
"Kids in this age group generally struggle to independently read the classroom clock, so pictures of the clock instead of the written time numbers can be super helpful"
"Also, request that your child be given a visual timer to show how long they have to complete an assignment in class"
Visual timers are super important for this age group because of the lack of clock reading skills
"
- Request that the teacher ask your child to repeat instructions back to them to confirm that the child understands what they should be doing"
"Writen or visual institutions can also help with completing tasks.
- A structured break time can also be helpful"
"Structured means that your child is told and knows where in the classroom they can take a break (like a specific desk or corner of the room), how long that break can last (visual timers or hour glass timers help here), and what they can do during that break (like sit or stretch)"
"If it helps, I used to have a break corner with a little rug and a kids yoga poses poster on the wall"
"

>cant stay on the ""carpet area"" during lectures,

Uhg.."
I hate teacher like this
They insist that 6 year olds have to sit perfectly still on the rug
"It's sometimes valid because space, but also no 6 year old can sit on the ground for more than 10 minutes without getting antsy"
"Anyway, my tips:

- Request that your child be allowed to sit at back of the rug and that they be allowed to stand or stretch within a certain amount if space"
"This sounds so crazy because you'd think they should be upfront if they struggle with listening, but it works for a lot of fidgety kids, especially those that need to ""go to the bathroom"" every 15 minutes (they don't need to; they just say that so they can walk around the classroom during instruction)"
"I used to require my students always stay in their carpet square, and I had this one student that used to stand up every 2 to 3 minutes to stand on one foot for 2 to 3 minutes before sitting back down and repeating the cycle"
"Believe it or not, he was the most engaged in my lessons"
"
- Another alternative is to ask for a chair with a bounce band on it for circle time"
It can be an alternative for kids who have fidgety legs
"
- Also, make sure your kid is actually getting to participate in recess"
"Lots of teachers subtract recess time for misbehavior during class, and a lack of recess time can make fidgeting symptoms significantly worse"
"

Other random tips:

- I don't really recommend fidgets for this age grouo because kids this age have a hard time telling the difference between fidgets and toys"
"But I do recommend active seating, like bound bands on chairs or a wobble stool"
It can also help to change independent learning locations
"For example, instead of working at a desk, the student can be allowed to use a clipboard on the carpet or floor"
I've also had students who liked to use their chairs as desks..
"Don't get that one, but I can't judge too hard when the work gets done quietly and efficiently (which is important for 6 year olds)"
" 
- Practice classroom expectations at home"
"For example, most teachers require that students clean up their stations before moving to the next task, so it can be helpful to practice cleaning up a toy before taking a new one out to play with it at home"
You can also practice turn taking at home too
"
- If the teacher insists that your child is constantly misbehaving in class even after the accommodations, request that the special ed teacher or the behavior intervention specialist observe your child in class, and that they develop a behavior intervention strategy"
Sometimes kids with ADHD do actually have behavior problems that are only present in a classroom setting because they haven't quite learned the behavior norms for a classroom
"So, it's not that your kid is necessarily a ""bad kid"", but rather that they just haven't learned the right way to behave in school and they need someone to teach them"
" 
- Somewhere around 3rd or 4th grade, you should request that the school build a plan to teach him organizational skills"
Kids with ADHD need explicit instruction in this area
"There's a special education program called HOPS (Homework, Organization, and Planning Skills) that I especially like for the upper elementary and middle school grade levels.

Sorry this got long out of no where, and I'm sure I rambled a bit"
But I hope it helps a little.
Thank you!! For sure on that last part..
"His dad is quite hesitant of medication because he was a ritalin child growing up and he wants to exhaust all other efforts first, I can appreciate that, but I hope kiddo doesn't start hating school by the time that happens"
"The good thing is that he should be able to relate to the struggles our son is having, having been there himself"
I'm also hoping the therapist can help dad understand whether medication is truly necessary (or not).
This is great feedback! Thank you so much!
"Honestly if you guys can nail down specific accommodations, that actually target what you’re trying to work on"
It will make a world of difference
Sometimes you go into these things and they just want to slap generic plans down and hope it works
Hopefully you can have a positive experience with this process!
"Also, just so you know, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) gives you the right to request an IEP meeting and request testing if you suspect that your child has a disability that effects their ability to learn in a general education setting"
You are not required to wait for testing or a diagnosis in order to request that your school test your child for special education services
IDEA makes the evaluation process the responsibility of the school district from the age of 3 all the way until high school graduation or 21 which ever comes first (a different government agency does the testing for kids from birth to age 3)
"Basically, if you request it, they have to evaluate your child unless they have data to prove that your child doesn't have a disability (and even then it's kind of a dicey decision on their part not to test since it opens the doors to a potential lawsuit.."
"They'd have to have some real solid evidence to defend that choice)

Anyway, if you choose to, you can get the evaluation ball rolling on Monday morning"
You don't have to wait for your kid to see a doctor
Usually you have to notify the principal in writing to request an evaluation
"Though, sometimes it might be the assistant principal that oversees your child's grade level or the special education coordinator"
Theres some easy to find resources online for writing the letter if you're not sure what to write.
"Thank you so much! We already have a diagnosis since last week, but I'm kind of bitter now, because she definitely did not let me KNOW avout IDEA before we had a diagnosis even though she knows we suspected adhd"
She pushed that we needed a diagnosis first
😔
I don't really blame the teacher for that one
Gen ed teachers aren't normally involved in the special education evaluation process unless a disability has already been identified
"Unless the teacher holds an ESE (Exceptional Students Education) certification, it's unlikely that they have ever had to initiate an IEP evaluation or know the steps and that there's a process for how schools can assume a child has a disability without diagnosing them (since schools can't diagnose disabilities)"
They could also just be too emotionally exhausted from all the bureaucratic red tape and piles of paper work and dozens of emails and dozens of phone calls and multiple observations and mountains of documentation that it takes to get a student in their class evaluated without a diagnosis
Both are unfortunate products of an underfunded and financially mismanaged education system.
"Thanks again for the insights, you've been very helpful!"

Are you treating your anxiety?
"I struggle with this exact same thing (I’m honestly doing that exact thing as I type this out right now, as I have multiple assignments I should be working on)"
"My meditation definitely improves my focus, just a lot of the time the things I focus on aren’t really what I should be necessarily putting my attention towards at that moment"
I agree that it’s a way to avoid the anxiety of doing the things I really don’t want to be doing
The best way I’ve found to combat this is to just remove myself from my potential distractors before I take my medication
That way when it kicks in I’ll be already doing what I need to do and will have no other choice but to continue on with it
"For example if I have a big project for school I need to finish, I’ll go to the library first then take my medication"
I find if I try to do my school work at home I’ll end up finding other things to do around the house to focus on that aren’t as productive.
"I feel this but you gotta keep busy with things you wouldn’t normally enjoy.

Sounds weird but to put things simply if I take my meds I will enjoy washing up, dishes whatever but i take my meds and sit down for a second and put on one of my fixations or favourite shows I will just enjoy it even more than I usually do and won’t move for hours and then the dishes are still there"
"I was doing CBT in the summer before uni started but I’m in the UK and it was free with the NHS, the guy released me before uni started saying we’d made progress"
I tried telling him I’d like a catch up or something after uni starts cuz sitting at home playing video games all summer hasn’t been particularly anxiety inducing but he didn’t go for it
"So now I can wait another 2 years for another NHS appointment, Pay a few thousand pounds for private care, 3rd option is to tell them I’m going to jump of a bridge and they might see me sooner but lying to them also gives me anxiety"
Currently I’m just trying to put what we talked about over the summer into practice but it’s a lot easier to talk about it than it is to actually do it
Rn I’m behind with uni and everything is feeling really overwhelming.
I think it’s not just that I just don’t enjoy it though
I don’t mind dishes or housework etc
things like going to the gym have become quite easy actually but uni make my teeth chatter and so it’s really easy to just do it after I finish *this* that’s never finished.
"Most, if not all, universities have mental health services available on campus"
Try accessing resources assistance through them
Even if they don’t have the full spectrum of services there’s likely something you can benefit from
I went through a tough time at university and was able to get into a therapy group for a while that was very supportive.

Any point seeing psych if meds are likely to be intolerable?

I would recommend trying them, but make sure to notify the prescribing doc if they produce severe side effects.

So you sound like me and have seasonal depression (SAD)
"I used to go through this every fall, have a period where i was just drained and feeling the blues"
"

Wellbutrin might be helpful"
I started taking Wellbutrin and I have basically stopped going through the blues in the fall
"It also helps just realizing that this is gonna happen, it's my normal reaction to changing to winter"
"I have the opposite effect in the Spring, get super excited, lots of energy, etc.

Good luck i truly think this could help"
"It's also supposed to help people with ADHD in other ways, can't remember off hand rn."
I am sorry you are going through this
"

The weather here in the Pacific Northwest can be pretty dismal at this time of the year"
"
As per my doc:
 -happy lamp for 30mins a day, -vitamin d of at least 3000 in daily
 -blue therapy(spend time in enjoying the outdoors)
-exercise, even if that means repeatedly climbing the stairs in the house"
"

I hope you find what works for you."
I take 150mg Wellbutrin in the spring/summer and bump it up to 300mg during the fall/winter
Light therapy  for 40 minutes and I take 10000 units of D3 daily
scheduling a short getaway to a sunny spot in February works wonders.
Me and SAD have been best friends for the last 12ish years
I live in Alaska
During the winter we get 4 hours of sun (if you can even call it that
The sun never leaves the horizon)
This summer I was diagnosed with bi-polar type 2 ( apparently it isn’t normal to think you’re superior to people or to think a deity communicates with you)
I was put on birth bi polar meds
I was expecting the normal winter dip a month ago but it hasn’t come yet
You’re doing all the right things
You may wanna up your vitamin d dose

I was on adderall for 6 years
Had to increase the dose every once and awhile
Got to 40
I quit cold turkey in a time when I could
Not working
Fast forward 5 years off and I need something again so I was put on adderall and it was not the same
I had panic attacks and my heart was pounding
I switched to concerta today and so far it’s great
Lowest dose so I will need a bit more but it’s much better for me
"Point is, find what works for you"
Adderall once did
Concerta maybe it now
We are all different
Also know that coming off was rough for about 2-3 weeks
Tired
Moody
Expect it and do that when you can
Good luck to you
Give it a shot.
Thanks
The clinic I’m doing it all with do a trial run where if something doesn’t work I can switch and test out and up doseage all that
Adderall is illegal where I live so it would probably be switching to concerta or a dex-amphetamine if I needed to
Guess all I can do now is go ahead expecting some bumps

Why are my ADHD meds a hit or miss?

What else are you eating? Are you getting enough sleep? All that stuff
"They definitely don’t tell you that these meds can be finicky, when I first started adderall nobody mentioned I should stop taking vitamin C supplements, as a great example."
Don’t forget that sleep can play a role too!
"Yeah sorry, I stay clear of anything with Vitamin C, I’ve always had problems with sleep even if I’m completely shot and can fall asleep in a public place once I get into my bed I’m wired but I do force myself to get about 6 hours of sleep"
"I tried eating 30 min before/after taking the meds and try and stick with all healthy foods, I’m 174 5’10"
"I have the same problem truthfully, I’m 6’ 195 and when I was on amphetamines I could not get anywhere even close to what they suggested it should last"
After it drug in for months they swapped me to methylphenidate
"It lasts marginally longer for me, and still barely covers a full work day with an ER and an IR"
"

I think it’s a metabolism thing for some of us truthfully"
I spent months trying everything I could to get some longevity out of them with no luck
Is this your first time with meds or no? Sometimes they just kind of have to rapid fire you through the nearly 30 drugs on the market at different doses until something sticks
Finding a confident doctor that knows their stuff is a miracle though.
I started taking the amphetamines 4 years ago but I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD since I was 11
"I never could really hold a job because I’d get incredibly side tracked or even a conversation because I’d get so bored I’d start yawning and zone out, but for the 1-2 hours the amphetamines work It makes me want to be social and actually enjoy/do things and that’s all the hope I need to keep trying, but maybe I do need a psychiatrist who specializes in adhd because my regular doctor who prescribes me the amphetamines isn’t that great on the subject"
Honestly it feels like a fight sometimes
"As an adult my doctor needs to be on the same page as me, that there are times I need closer to 14-16 hours out of my day"
"4-6 isn’t going to cut it for sure, that’s not even a work day for most of us.

I hated getting a second opinion and finding a new provider, I felt guilty?, but honestly talking with someone who knew their stuff on these meds made a world of difference in my confidence that eventually they can get me on a combo of meds that actually work"
I also started seeing results in a lot more reasonable time frame instead of languishing on the same drug that wasn’t working for a month or more between changes.
"Yeah I work anywhere from 10-12 hour days in sales so if the dose ends up wearing off it’s incredibly embarrassing feeling so droopy and slow and then coming home and not giving the people you love the attention they need is even worse, I guess I really just need to find another psychiatrist"
Most of them that take my insurance aren’t accepting new patients but maybe driving 40min to see one would be worth it
Thanks
Also medications metabolize differently for different people
Ask your doctor about psychiatric genetic testing
They can literally tell you which medications will metabolize better for you and which ones to avoid.

I’d get a second opinion from another doctor.
"I am also very smart, but I went through a similar sounding exam (28, I just didn't apply myself"
"Also lazy) and got told I was ADHD. 




This kind of shit is why I am a nervous wreck at the doctor"
"He probably won't lose his mind and tell me now I can't have Adderall, but he will supply me with fresh squeezed coconut water instead as he believes it is as effective, but he has the fucking power to do that and I would be fucked until I found a new doctor."
"I think it’s not just about how you do in a task, but more how you deal with it"
My psychiatrist noticed my inattentiveness on our first session but postponed looking into it until my anxiety and depression symptoms were under control
"Almost 10 months later, and after tests and observations and learning about my history and how I coped with it, I finally got a diagnosis."
Yeah! I totally agree-- kind of crazy that some testing procedures just look at your results and not you as a person
I'm glad you had someone you could work with and finally figure things out!

I think your love for verbal expression might be put into use where it’s viewed as a skill
It might not be for everyone in a social setting but can become a positive in a job/hobby where it is essential
Look for things you like to do that have an intersection with verbal communication
Like being a game commentator
Keep trying until you find something you enjoy doing
 Hope this helps!
"the key is to be self aware, try to notice when you are talking too much"
A good signifier is they aren't responding
"If the back and forth is more forth and less back, stop talking"
"Also listen to how they react, are they laughing at your jokes, are they responding to what you say or just taking after you, do they repeat part of what you say to keep the convo going"
" 

That being said, doesn't always work, sometimes I know I'm talking too much but can't stop lol, it's like a car who's brakes were cut, just gotta keep going until you naturally stop or crash lol."

"I'm going to be a little against the ""Just try CBT"" because having done CBT with undiagnosed ADHD I found myself constantly slipping into a ""Crunch time"" of trying to get the homework done before every session which did not help my mental health at all.


I have heard better things about DBT, and now that I'm diagnosed my psychiatrist has recommended me to start some in the near future"
"That said, if you can find someone who specializes in either for application to people who have ADHD you'll go a lot farther than just to start taking it.


CBT does great for figuring out the ""Why's"" of how you think/react/cope with things..."
But imo it was only useful for me for realizing that I had executive function issues already and that my depression and anxiety episodes where being triggered by decades of unmanaged ADHD.
"If your country allows Wellbutrin, that could be an option to look into"
It treats depression and BED.
I was unmedicated in college
"Honestly, what saved me was having a study buddy"
"Someone to body-double with, it's like day and night for productivity"
Bonus if they have the same classes/degree as you
"Oops, now you have friends, too."
I feel you..
I'm from India and although there is medication and therapy available for adhd there its just that..
there's no awareness for it
When I was 16 i tried telling my parents that I have adhd and they gaslit me into thinking that I'm just making things up because they'd never heard of such a thing called adhd
they said that if I tried hard enough I could focus on my work
it was quite literally one of the worst days of my life
i felt how you feel
"completely helpless.

I had the same dream of studying abroad but I barely managed to pass my high school exams (even failed one of them and had to regive it)"
"after that point I knew that I just needed to get out of the country so I managed to get admission in a small uni in the UK (couldn't make my dream uni ofc) with one of my goals being to get an adhd assessment.

now I knew that UK had a free healthcare system that included mental health services, I just wasn't aware that the system was FUCKED"
the wait time for an adhd assessment was three years and thats how long my degree is
"so I literally wasted like 2 yrs in considering wether I want to get it done or not.

I'm in my third year now and honestly my adhd had me at my worst.."
"I was failing assignments again, and my friendships were falling apart, so I finally decided to pay to get an assessment done"
The assessment and medication has cost me quite a lot and I'm currently broke because of it but it's honestly been the best decision I could make
"Ive started meds and theyre helping me out a lot but honestly it doesn't fix everything.

I'm gonna be honest with you.."
meds help but there are several ways to cope with adhd without meds
I'd suggest you look them to help you get through school
Hopefully you're able to get out of the country after school and then save up for an assessment
"but trust me you can work with your adhd, I know its hard but you can do it"
"i believe in you

sorry for yapping 😭"
"An answer you may not like to hear: 30 minutes of cardiovascular exercise at least 3 times per week, and cold water immersion have an extremely positive impact on my symptoms"
This combined with therapy and meditation hits many of the most noticeable symptoms without use of medication.
1
"Yes exercise!
2"
"An anti-inflammatory diet of no sugar and no flour helped me a lot.
3"
"Structure, structure, structure"
Start building specific habit stacks (routines) for morning and evening
"Start with a short list of tasks you want to get done, write them down and DO them every day"
Start small and add to your lists as the tasks become routine
"For instance , a PM routine might be 
Wash dishes
Prep coffeemaker 
Check or write tomorrow’s sched.
Pack tomorrow’s lunch
    When those tasks become automatic, you can add to or replace them with other habits you want to establish, like meditate or journal or study  language for 10 minutes , etc"
"
Meds are really helpful for some people, but for me, these kinds of changes have been more important."
"Dude--you can do things! For instance, your English is excellent! Never underestimate what you can do"
"There are tons of resources online these days (see what the others are advising here, and look up then up--hubermanlab.com, How To ADHD on Youtube, erc), build your routines, learn how to manage your brain, improve a little each day.."
"

Peace"
"Hey guys, I've been sitting here and reading through your responses and i just want to say that i really appreciate you all going out of your way to share advice"
I'll be trying my best to routinely incorporate all of what you told me and if i notice results i'll be sure to let you all know
Thanks once again!!
Exercise and caffeine if you can tolerate it
Caffeine has similar effects of meds but less effective and can fuck up your sleep.
A specific kind of exercise that can work (according to an ADHD book by Dr Russell Barkley I read years ago) is one that challenges your balance/equilibrium
"Things like skating (inline, roller, ice), yoga, gymnastics, balancing ball exercises, and anything else that really gets your cerebellum activated.
The cerebellum is the part of the brain that, among other things, helps with proprioception and balance, and it somehow also helps with managing ADHD impulsivity and other symptoms.

I can attest that I only made it through college unmedicated because I would skate three times a week"
It helped me immensely
"The bilateral stimulation from inline skating also helped me process any emotions I was going through at the time.

Sending you strength"
It freaking sucks to have to manage ADHD while unmedicated
My advice is this: as other people have stated exercise yes
Use your phone to set alarms for absolutely everything
Make sure you have routines as much as you can
My next piece of advice this: do everything you can to graduate from high school and get into college abroad
"Make sure you are going somewhere that does recognize ADHD, and get treatment there"
Good luck :)
"Bro, I’m going through the exact same thing"
"In Yemen, it’s incredibly hard to see a therapist because people—your own family even—start treating you like you’re losing your mind"
I’ve dealt with severe depression and anxiety for over six years
"At one point, I couldn’t sleep for more than 2–3 hours a night for almost a year"
"It wrecked my life—I lost my job, ruined my relationships, and my ADHD spiraled out of control"
"That’s when I realized I’ve had ADHD for 25 years without knowing.

I only found out two years ago, but for a long time, I couldn’t do anything about it"
I was too afraid of what people would say if I went to therapy
"Then, after hitting rock bottom like never before, I felt like I was truly losing it"
That’s when I finally built up the courage to see a therapist
"But when I told him about my ADHD, he dismissed me completely"
"He said I was just being soft, that I didn’t resist enough, and that I was looking for excuses or trying to get easy access to meds"
"Bro, I felt so defeated, like everything I went through was for nothing"
"It felt like the end of the road for me.

A year later, I hit another rock bottom"
"I couldn’t take it anymore, so I decided to search for a therapist who actually understands ADHD"
Can you imagine? There wasn’t a single one in my entire country
"Just when I was about to give up, I found a new therapist about three months ago"
"She works mostly with kids who have ADHD, but I went to her anyway"
"It took a lot of effort to convince her that I had ADHD, but after multiple tests, she confirmed it"
She also told me that Yemen doesn’t have access to the best medications for ADHD
"She prescribed me a children’s medication (STRATOMOX) in higher doses as a last resort.

I was desperate, so I started taking it, even though it’s really expensive"
"Some weeks, I couldn’t afford it, so I had to stop"
"Honestly, I haven’t seen much improvement yet, but I don’t know what else to do.

I’m suffering just like you, and I hope one day we can both find a way out of this"
💔
"Lots of caffeine, adequate sleep, and getting to another country, perhaps for college and then getting meds there."
"This will seem dismissive, but you handle it the same way everyone who lives undiagnosed (me for 40 years) or unmedicated (me for the past few)"
"You do your best, you learn techniques for managing your challenges, knowing you have this disorder helps a lot"
We all struggle with it differently but there ARE advantages to ADHD and you can benefit from those even while you suffer from the challenges.
"I would recommend cognitive behavioral therapy, maybe see if there are alternative medications you can take"
Also try and eat a high protein diet
Caffeine also helps to an extent
Look into non-stimulant medications like guanfacine. 
Exercise and loads and loads of coffee.
Black coffee and cigarettes.
"My old boss refused to get a diagnosis and instead self-medicated with Excedrin (contains caffeine) and Sudafed (contains pseudoephedrine, which is a mild stimulant)"
"I wouldn’t recommend it every day, but it def worked for her when she really needed to get something done"
Also a cup of black coffee to start the day every morning before breakfast.
Good news for you
There are things you can you and it’s proven to help
"
Check out the book 
Edward M"
"Hallowell
ADHD 2.0: New Science and Essential Strategies for Thriving with Distraction - from Childhood through Adulthood
He is a psychiatrist with adhd and has a huge drive to find new methods"
He describes a protocol that helped others where medication is not available
"
My personal experience, since I stand on my balance board and do balance exercises with my beds, I got better and their behaviour improved."
How were you diagnosed if it's not recognized by the doctors you see?
"The two things that seemed to work best for me were, exercise (I've done both weight training and tai chi for this) and *tremendous* quantities of caffeine.

The former is healthier than the latter."
"Can you move for ""education"" and then get that education on medication?  LOTS of people move for education, this is a time when you could make a new start"
 Then you are an adult and you can do what you want.
Maybe Saffron supplements? There is research that Saffron could work similarly to ADHD meds
I tried it and I think it works good but right know I have different condition and can't take it anymore
It has some psychoactive properties thanks to Corocin and Safranal
They should be somehow acessable to order by internet
Make sure if they have enough of corocin and Safranal
"2% and 3% each is OK, but some have 0,002 or something and are useless."
"Truthfully, I can't give you much advice beyond some basic behaviors"
"Your goal shouldn't be to ""cure"" or ""treat"" but rather work with yourself to get things done"
"Working in a library with a friend, using your calendar on your phone and caffeine will be indispensable.

It can be done, hyperfocus especially in college is really your biggest strength against all of your hurdles"
"Beyond that, some anti-depressants can be used to treat ADHD with differing effectiveness"
Best of luck.
I'm so sorry
I hope that you can move somewhere and get real treatment
"I wasn't diagnosed until I was 40, so I know how you feel"
"I feel like I had to work so much harder than everyone else just to be at the same place.

My first ADHD doctor used to say that the things you do to help ADHD are like legs of a table, and that medication is only one leg"
"You might be able to function without the medication if you do enough of the other things - but medication alone won't help you.

Every small thing you learn to do now will help you later when you can actually have medication.

Some of the things that have actually helped me: 

Protein"
Especially for breakfast
"Try to eat a decent amount of protein in the first hour after you wake up.

Exercise"
Cardio helps me the most
"I started to really see a difference after I was doing an hour a day, several times a week"
"You don't have to do this all at once, and that might even be counter productive"
"Try to add in as much walking as you can, all throughout the day"
"Walking is so helpful, especially outdoors"
"But whenever possible, you also need to sprint, to make yourself breathe hard for a time.

Exercise part 2: walk while you study"
"When I took my notes, I actually wrote them as questions to ask myself"
"Then as I walked, I would read and answer my questions"
"This is how I studied, and for me it worked.

Avoid additives"
Things like preservatives and dyes in your food and drinks
"These are known to be bad for ADHD.

Fish"
I think the research on this is not complete but all my doctors have recommended eating fish
"This also helps with getting more protein.

Caffeine"
"I can't have it now with medication, but caffeine was a very big help to me before I was diagnosed"
Just be careful not to overdo it
"It's helpful while you have to be still and concentrate.

Sugar"
"It isn't sugar itself, but more about stabilizing blood sugar"
I noticed my ADHD symptoms improved as I was working to stabilize my blood sugar for other reasons
"To do this, I am careful to limit refined sugar and simple carbohydrates like white bread and white potatoes"
"When I have something like this, I eat a small amount and pair it with protein and healthy fats.

Find a calendar/reminder system that works for you and stick with it"
Whatever this is
Every single thing has to go into this
"I set calendar alarms on my phone for everything I need to remember to do, but my life is more simple now"
At one point I used a bullet journal when I had a lot to remember and that worked quite well
"For this to work, I had to get one that I could carry everywhere, all the time"
"Writing with pen and paper has always been effective for me.

Tweak everything"
You have a unique and creative brain
Let it run wild
Find new solutions
Try many things
You are a scientist working to understand yourself
"If you fail at something, then you have learned that part of your system failed"
Don't worry about following any system except what works for YOU.
“How to ADHD” has some good videos on organization and brain hack type things that can help
 Anything to give you a leg up and help you get somewhere where you can seek treatment!
"You might have to move.

Caffeine helps a bit."
Former teacher with adhd kids here
I survived college on soda
It helped me concentrate
Not the best solution by any means
I was finally diagnosed in my 40's because my kids were
"I worked with my own adhd, my children's adhd as well as worked in a school with students with adhd"
There is a ton of information on youtube and reddit
But looking at adhd from a teacher standpoint one of my favorite YouTube people is Seth Perler
He works with students and teachers and uses a lot of things my school used
I really like his basic hands on and experienced approach
The second recommendation is movement breaks
We'd have kids squirming all over the place in class
"We'd take a break, they'd run around, come back and can concentrate better"
"Run around the outside of the building, put in some gym time etc"
"Overall having a steady workout routine is good, actually have a daily routine/schedule to help your body, balanced eating is good, all the healthy stuff."
"Is wellbutrin / bupropion legal in your country? If so, give that a try"
"

And there are plenty of people who got late diagnosed who succeeded in life in spite of untreated ADHD"
"It's harder for you, sure, but you don't need to feel helpless because you don't have proper med access"
Knowing you have ADHD is still better than struggling without knowing why.
Check into medications that help ADHD as a secondary use
 Welbutrin is mainly used for depression but has ADHD as a secondary use
 That has worked wonders for me.
Start exercising a lot if you don’t already
Granted I used medication but it also helps a lot for me
"Coffee, lots of coffee"
It’s almost the same.
"You do what ADHD people did to achieve success for millennia: you work 50% harder than everybody else to develop strategies to cope with your symptoms, and be extremely regimented in sticking to them so you can be as effective as possible."
No matter what I would resist the mindset that medication will solve all of your problems and magically make you more productive and attentive because it won’t
You need to address specifically which ADHD symptoms impact your life and to what severity
"As someone who went to college unmedicated and untreated, it is absolutely possible"
You would just have to be more disciplined and more aware of meeting your daily needs before you can perform in school
"College will require you to manage your health as well as your grades, but being prepared is the key"
You should take this time to learn good coping skills to help you regulate your emotions
Take the time to learn how to take notes and keep yourself organized during class and after class
"Also, if you have good friends and family, find a good support system so when you can call when you feel down on yourself"
"Always always always make time to eat sleep and do something fun for yourself, we are not motivated by normal achievements"
We are not programmed to be good at forming habits so give yourself grace and extra time to do nothing if you wish
"Skip a day if you must, but go tomorrow"
"
You are an adult now, but that’s the best part!It’s entirely on you to manage it however you see fit"
You got this!
I have been through the same thing
"Now I'm a medical doctor in the US.

I would suggest dealing with comorbid mental health difficulties(Depression, Anxiety..) , which are extremely common in ADHD"
It does not have to be devere to become problematic
I never thought counseling would benefit me until I started it for adhd and dealt with other dormant problems too
It's very hard to focus when you have emotionally more important worries
It will make managing ADHD much easier
"From my personal experience and lots of research managing ADHD is basically building an effective routine or eliminating the need for decision-making.

How I became efficient: My study period was tied to a family member's working hours"
I had to leave and come back at a certain time with her and went to the library or coffee shops(which only were associated with studying)
 I put a lot of effort into planning the whole week/month (depending on situation)
I planned every hour for different subjects) study resources
"every other hour was free, meaning I could do whatever I wanted, study, eat or play clahs royale"
You should give you ADHD some time to express itself too ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|hug)
"If I could not study enough in dedicated time, even in periods of important exams"
Its equally important to dedicate time to having fun
"Basically control your time and avoid the greatest threat - procrastination.

A week before I started this routine, I could not imagine myself being so efficient and doing that"
"It may sound hard, but as long as you eliminate the need of frequent decision-making, its gonna go smoothly.

Last thing"
Nicotine and caffeine are stimulants
"Don't start smoking, that's gonna make your condition and health even worse, but using nicotine patches or gums  while studying can improve your focus"
"Simple advice but don't drink coffee after noon(at least routinely).

There most probably will be  some non-stimulant medications available and they are proven to be effective"
"Try to find a good mental health professional, don't delay it for years like I did"
good luck!
"I think a big part of overpowering the ADHD symptoms is accountability, whether it’s through therapy, a journal/planner, or friends/family"
I’ve realized in my own life that having evidence of my performance in front of my face motivates me to do better
"If no one calls me out or I let myself get away with not doing something, I just won’t do it"
"But if someone says something to me or I look at where I’ve written down just how long I’ve procrastinated on something, that’s like a kick in the ass for me that allows me to overcome my bad habits long enough to get back on track."
It has been shown that Therapy can address ADHD
"The primary and most effective way is medication yes, there are non-stimulant medication’s that can work"
"Strattera (Atomoxetine) is an ADHD med that, at least in United States, is not considered a stimulant"
Though it does act very similar
"I was on this for a long time and it worked for me very well, but I started to have side effects specifically with my stomach and if you’re a male possibly your testicles may hurt"
"(It is a real side effect to be clear) 
There are methods to address it without stimulant medication, I’m not gonna pretend that they are better or worse, but when it comes to -how do you live your life-; you do it with the best options available"
I wish you the best of luck.
There is hope! Please try and don't ever stop trying
This is coming from a 45 year old dude who got his diagnose and medication 6 months ago
I've had serious struggles in my life but they made me who I am and I'm grateful for that

It can be useful to ensure your protein intake is sufficient and that you have things to look forward to after completing a task
"I know discipline is not always easy with adhd, but having something fun you can do after a task is a good motivation"
"Also, doing studying and hw physically next to another person works wonders"

I will add to the really helpful suggestions with: you may want to look into some ADHD workbooks online

It is not that adhd isn’t recognised in Algeria it is that its medication isn’t allowed to be prescribed and sold because they can’t manage it

"To clarify, I don't advocate for any of it, but I want to communicate that I relate to how you feel.

Desperate isn't a strong enough word for how I feel to get better by any means, but I'll add to the refrain here that you should try to incorporate cardio into your life, consider suspiciously pseudoscientific seeming supplements like magnesium, fish oil, and vitamin D, and try the non-stimulant medication if that's an option"

Classic mentality of ADHD = lazy and undiscipline

Use timers and alerts on your phone
Get everything on a calendar
That can help with your executive function issues
Do look at Cognitive Distortions to possibly help with negative self-talk
You’re not alone and it can get better.
There’s a lot of really annoying short term ways that you can improve upon your symptoms for when you need to get something done
"Sit with someone who’s really reserved, try to avoid living or working in rooms with certain color pallets, do homework during lunch while out in public, listen to spatial music without lyrics while working on assignments, put your phone up, don’t sleep with your tv on, if you’re going to college try to have a physical exercise class whenever you have free electives, break up all of your work into sections, drink caffeine in the morning, and ALWAYS brush your teeth"
You’ll be okay
"Get diagnosed for anxiety or depression, some of the meds are also non stimulates for adhd, only problem is the dosage"
"I've had a positive response to Clonidine, which is also prescribed for high blood pressure and probably is legal in your country"
"If you can find a sympathetic GP, it might be worth trying.

As others have said, do all the non-medication things, they don't tend to be as 'miraculous' some medication responses, but they do all help"
Good luck!
"There are many non-psychoactive meds, and many ""natural"" supplement treatments that some people with adhd swear by and there are emerging studies on"
"I'd suggest possibly looking into those (book- finally focused, etc)"
"Agree with others that exertive exercise, sleeping same hours every night as much as possible, and eating same times as much as possible will have a significant effect.

We also know that omega-3s and vitamin D supplements do show significant benefit when studied.

When it comes to supplementing with supplements, rationing out coffee through a morning can help"
Divide a cup of coffee into four shots that you take each hour instead of just drinking it in the first hour
This method has been tested on general population and shows that people stay more alert through a morning
"Test yourself and adjust amounts to see if you get a benefit.

Other DIY option some use is nicotine in the form of lozenges or patches"
Have to be careful with this one as nicotine becomes addictive when you exceed 6mg per day roughly
"So, you could use up to three 2mg nicotine lozenges each day as a form of stimulant to see how they work for you"
"Without the negative compounds found in tobacco, nicotine itself is a lot like caffeine, but can work better for some people"
Just stay very low on doses

Examples of open skill/higher cognitive demand exercises include ball sports (including racket sports), martial arts (evidence for Taekwondo), dual tasking (e.g"

do they prescribe modafinil or afranil or something like that for shift disorder? what about other stimulants

I'm glad yours got proper attention
I hope you find something that helps you
"Immediately stop all carbohydrates - focus on fatty red meats, eggs and butter and vegetables (if you cannot go without).

Also drink only water"
Take caffiene pills (200mg every couple of hours) - its not the same but it does help you be alert
Developing ADHD is not your fault.
"So if you're unmedicated there's some things you can do to help increase your available executive function resources.

Daily intense exercise can help dramatically"
When 30 min-1hr is very helpful
"Eating a good diet, high protein is supposed to help as well"
Prepping foods beforehand or food you can just pick up and eat on whim with no prep will help you be consistent
"

Sleep, super important"
"The more you run on fumes, the harder it is to make yourself do what you need"
"

Finally, some caffeine is one of the oldest ways to self medicate"
Just try not to fuck up your sleep with it
"

If you have to pick one of these, I'd highly suggest the intense exercise"
It'll help you regulate everything else
I'm curious if khat available there
If so is it legal cuz I've heard some people get help with it
Caffeine and theanine - on a strict schedule so that you don’t over do it - should help a little.
"If your country doesn’t recognise ADHD, who diagnosed you?"
I think Khat is available there and contains something similar but no idea if that has efficacy
Is Modafinil available there? If not maybe consume a lot of caffeine?
"There are two non-stimulant (and thus, legal...) treatments approved for treatment of ADHD - guanfacine and atomoxetine"
"There are also drugs that have not been approved, but may have some efficacy, for example: buproprion."
At that point just leave algeria
"This is absolutely the wrong advice, but Ritalin and Adderall are just derivatives of the street drug Amphetamine, street name speed"
And this is absolutely not what I've been medicating with for a fair while
"Just make sure u monitor ur dosage size, because its super easy to take too much and just end up getting high"
I got by for about 15 years on copious amounts of caffeine and doing more hands-on jobs that paperwork and studying jobs
"Once I moved into office work I had no choice but to get medicated, though"
Sorry for your struggles i dont think people realise how debilitating it can be most just think you struggle to focus and get hyper my life is so bad right now ive been off meds so long started getting physical symtoms worst is i have constant shaking all the time
When were you diagnosed?
"Well the medication is great, but doesn't do everything for you; I may be wrong, but I belive that cognitive behavior therapy has the same efficacy of the medication (in compared studies - but not being a ""instant"" thing)"
Also for a lot of time people all over the world haven't access to medication
"I'm 28y old (finished my first degree in college without knowing anything about having the disorder), just recently I got my diagnosis and started the treatment"
"  
Many of us, for years self medicated (may it be ilegal drugs), like drinking a lot of coffee or tea"
"You can try doing exercises, specific diet, supplementation, etc"
"  
Try reading books about ADHD that brings a different approach/ non pharmaceutical"
Hope you do well!
Caffeine in the morning
Avoid sugars and simple carbohydrates as much as you can
"Get a book on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and if you can, get a therapist"
"Nothing cures ADHD, not even medication"
"But therapy alone is, in my opinion, better than medication alone"
All the usual healthy living advice is doubly applicable for people with adhd

"this subreddit is for western people only its not meant for people like us the only advice you'll get will be ""pull yourself up by your bootstraps"" but phrased differently"
Didn't read post but try Wellbutrin
It's the only non stimulant medication that's provided me any benefits.
"Hi OP, I was unmedicated for a long time"
"Stimulants are amazing for me in their longevity, and in that journey the routine I've found that works at least half-way is the following.

Do all the traditional things for your health such as exercise and quality sleep, apply whatever industry techniques of workflow and effectiveness of your best peers"
"Doing this effectively will be nigh impossible, except I had a routine of nicotine gum/lozenges and caffeine in form of coffee/lozenges"
"Caffeine is well known, but I'd like to speak a little bit about nicotine.

You are under 18, so this may be difficult, but nicotine gum is usually less regulated"
"I started off doing 2 mg gums, and the technique is to chew to feel some stimulation, but unlike normal gum, cease chewing when effect is achieved"
"

Doing the two is not like Adderall/mixed amphetamine salts in longevity, but if you dose it right, gets there in terms of effectiveness"
"Nicotine in this form offers very little negative effects, beyond vasoconstriction, and typical side-effects with caffeine as well"
I highly recommend that you at least try it once
"Speaking of addictiveness, I've heard all across the board in terms of personal feelings of addiction"
"Just speaking for myself and a large group of friends, the behavioral desire for nicotine is the same as desiring alertness, rather than a bodily need"
"Others have said similar things about coffee as well, so I would say explore, but as always, tread carefully"
"

Like any medical advice, I am not an MD, nor YOUR MD"
But I found the above an amazing recipe that worked well to get me to this point.

"Just to add on, there are therapists who do CBT that is more targeted towards ADHD, however that may be hard to find where you live given the circumstances."
That’s interesting
"

I know people can really benefit from CBT, but I had a bad time with it"
My issue wasn’t discerning unhelpful or false thoughts and beliefs from the ‘good’ thoughts and beliefs
It was having all the thoughts all the time
"It didn’t matter how realistic or compassionate my beliefs about myself were, they persisted"
"In fact by making me more conscious of them, CBT actually made me more aware of negative thoughts and gave me the feeling of being ‘bad at CBT’ because I was having them."
"Im not doing CBT but i certainly am in that ""crunch time"" mindset and its absolutely killing me, ill look into it and see if DBT is available where im at"
Wellbutrin changed my life
"Treated the results of my undiagnosed ADHD (depression, lethargy, some motivation) and got me going"
Though I do think it's not as effective as stimulants purely for ADHD symptoms.
"Also, it’s an off-label use for ADHD"
In some countries you can only get a prescription to help quit smoking lol
Since my own experience with Wellbutrin was pretty rough I'm just going to throw out that Atomoxetine (Strattera) is a similar non stimulant that has been really helpful to me.
How is this helping ADHD?
"Honestly i tried having a study buddy last year and it barely helped, I'd argue it made me feel worse about myself knowing that other people are able to study fine and work towards their goals with little to no hindrances"
Thank you for the advice!!!

"It wrecked my life—I lost my job, ruined my relationships, and my ADHD spiraled out of control"
"That’s when I realized I’ve had ADHD for 25 years without knowing.

I only found out two years ago, but for a long time, I couldn’t do anything about it"
I was too afraid of what people would say if I went to therapy
"Then, after hitting rock bottom like never before, I felt like I was truly losing it"
That’s when I finally built up the courage to see a therapist
"But when I told him about my ADHD, he dismissed me completely"
"He said I was just being soft, that I didn’t resist enough, and that I was looking for excuses or trying to get easy access to meds"
"Bro, I felt so defeated, like everything I went through was for nothing"
"It felt like the end of the road for me.

A year later, I hit another rock bottom"
"I couldn’t take it anymore, so I decided to search for a therapist who actually understands ADHD"
Can you imagine? There wasn’t a single one in my entire country
"Just when I was about to give up, I found a new therapist about three months ago"
"She works mostly with kids who have ADHD, but I went to her anyway"
"It took a lot of effort to convince her that I had ADHD, but after multiple tests, she confirmed it"
She also told me that Yemen doesn’t have access to the best medications for ADHD
"She prescribed me a children’s medication (STRATOMOX) in higher doses as a last resort.

I was desperate, so I started taking it, even though it’s really expensive"
"Some weeks, I couldn’t afford it, so I had to stop"
"Honestly, I haven’t seen much improvement yet, but I don’t know what else to do.

I’m suffering just like you, and I hope one day we can both find a way out of this"
"💔

Sorry for yapping too 🤣"
I feel you bro
Grew up in India
No mental health care
 I was diagnosed only in the US in my 30s
Inattentive type and I pretty much developed a lot of coping mechanisms to deal with it
When all those started failing is when I got medicated
Hang in there.
Cold water immersion
That is interesting
"

We had a pool at my old condo and when I swam in it by myself for like 20 minutes in the evening afterwards I'd have this stillness in my mind that lasted maybe half an hour (never measured it)"
"The pool wasn't cold per se, being around 21 Celsius.

This is before my diagnosis."
"For the cold water immersion, could that be why cold showers seem to turn me into a functioning machine? I always get this burst of focus after one of them but never made the connection"
Hm..
Even worse info you won’t want to hear
I’m 49 and if I don’t get at least 6 hours of hard physical activity per week I have to be medicated for boring tasks
Physical activity doesn’t remove my symptoms but it removes 60-75% of them allowing me to work.
"On the cold water immersion thing; do cold showers work? Or does it have to to be an ice bath, or a deep plunge into cold water like someone in this thread mentioned?"
Meditation is severely underrated
That shit works if you got ADHD
I am saying this as the laziest person you gonna talk to all week.
"How cold are we talking, and how intense is the exercise?  If I'm wearing heart rate monitor, what range should I be in?

My mother-in-law considers a brisk walk to be exercise"
" I come from the ""if you ain't puking, you ain't trying"" tradition"
 I have no idea what that word means to most people
"

(I'm not bragging, I'm not really doing either of those things at the moment)."
"I walk over 12 km a day and have no results with helping my ADHD, lol. "
Have you ever truly experienced yourself while on medication?
Cold water immersion is a placebo
I second the anti-inflammatory diet! Huge improvement with just this
"Ketovore, only eating fatty meat, does the trick for me"
That way I’m functional
" Meditation does something too.
Having fluency in a second language also… boatloads of coffee.
I was unmedicated until 31"
 I got by ok
"I don’t ’need’ the Ritalin, but it is nice to be able to use it when I need to actually be able to notice the passing of time and remain on a task long enough to complete it.
But my first two degrees were completed without any medication"
 Bar coffee…
"Good luck!


Also maybe there is some adhd awareness activism and support groups in your country? "
"Wish you luck! As someone in the same boat, I can't even describe how much I appreciate this post and all the answers"
Caffeine makes me sleepy or very very little beneficts
"Wow that's an amazing thing I never knew it could help.
Thanks."
"
Does this help with treating distraction, inability to stay committed, lack of discipline, and low motivation to complete tasks? Or does it only help with stopping impulsivity?
And Is there any exercises I can do indoor?"
"Yep, i mentioned in the post that one of my goals is to get to another country for uni and getting the proper treatment i need there, its just that my disorder is getting in the way of actually having qualifications and grades good enough to go to college abroad"
Am I rare as someone who caffeine really messes up? 
"I was gonna say, my grandma coped by drinking a lot of coffee."
Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride helped me overcome lethargy for a short time
"I didn't use it every day, just on Saturdays when I needed to get some adulting done, like laundry and dishes"
"Maybe it was a placebo though, I don't really know for sure."
"Thnx, but what are the balance exercises? And how they help?"
Father's french friend is a qualified psychiatrist who I've had the pleasure of talking to about my gripes with ADHD a few times over the years
"He'd always tell me that had i not been algerian i could definitely get a legal diagnosis, so I'm primarily going off of that"
"Im trying to do exactly that yeah, but im gonna have to boast a robust resume if anyones gonna sponsor my leave / if any university would be willing to offer me a spot"
"The struggle i described in the post is the fact that my ADHD is griefing me by not letting me work as hard as possible in order to achieve that resume/qualifications, and that's taking its toll on me"
"Desperately wanna move, it's a life long goal of mine actually "
It’s true in a way
"My father was extremely strict with me, and while his methods—like threatening🥊🥲 me about bad grades or making poor decisions—might not have been great for my childhood experience, they did push me to succeed despite my ADHD"
"As a kid with ADHD, I struggled a lot: procrastinating, making mistakes, and delaying everything until the last minute"
"But thanks to the fear-driven motivation and adrenaline rush, I managed to get things done in record time.

I wasn’t perfect, but I did pretty well for someone with ADHD in school and life"
"However, things changed once I went to college and started earning my own money"
"Being far away from my father, I slowly lost control of myself"
"Without that external pressure, I didn’t realize how much I relied on fear and panic as motivators"
"Two years later, I hit rock bottom and couldn’t pull myself out, no matter how hard I tried.

Why? Because throughout my childhood, I never developed self-discipline"
"Instead, I depended on fear triggers that I couldn’t replicate or control"
"The irony is, I’m still grateful to my father"
"Without his strictness, I might’ve turned out worse"
"No hard feelings there.

Now that I understand my ADHD better, I’m working on finding solutions"
"It’s still challenging, but I’m determined to fix things and create a better future for myself."
"I'm from another country where stimulants are illegal, and here I was told that if have your prescription you will be ok, otherwise you'll be treated like a drug trafficker"
"The laws may vary, and the charges can be pretty serious"
"If there's any doubt, you shouldn't take the meds with you"
"also just want to say i'm so sorry you're dealing with this, it's not fair and I just recently got medicated myself and let me just say living unmediated with inattentive adhd is a special kind of hell, I'm just say gonna the things I wanted to hear, it's not your fault, there is hope, you are loved, and you deserve to be helped"

Can you share which studies you’re referring to?
I mentioned in the post that i'm from algeria
Didn't read the post
Suggests medical advice anyway
🙄
"Wellbutrin is actually still a stimulant, its just not as strong as Adderall, or methyphenidate"
I do find it is helpful for adhd however
It doesn't appear that Wellbutrin is available in Algeria.
"I know you are downvoted but as an older person who doesn’t have access to meds, I do this 😅"
Represses issues that have lead to burnout so I don’t necessarily recommend.
"I second DBT for ADHD - it's great for learning to manage intense emotions, which was (still sometimes is) a big problem for me.

However it also depends where you are feeling stuck with ADHD"
"It's it's focus, time management, etc"
"that you're struggling with, DBT might not be as helpful.

But there are many therapists with different approaches who specialize in ADHD"
Lots of them do virtual appointments now too
This is a great option if it's financially accessible (although I realize that it's not for many people)
"Ngl, I'm not an advocate for it myself for a variety of reasons, including the ones you describe"
"I was lucky then to have a good therapist who was willing to listen to my eventual concerns about ADHD (My psychiatrist at the time is another story, which is why it's taken 3 years to get a diagnosis). 


That said, I absolutely hate how it's just thrown at everyone was a cure all for all of life's ailments"
There are valid complaints about how it can also be used as a type of self brainwashing
My experience I feel is atypical because how much i would end up just thinking things out in the moment in our sessions vs actually applying it in everyday life. 
https://dialecticalbehaviortherapy.com/ is free and IMO worth doing.
"I switched from citalopram which I'd been talking for decades before I was diagnosed with adhd, and welbutrin (well, a generic equivalent) has really made a difference.


Although coming off from citalopram has been rough. "
Worst experience of my life the second was Guanfacine.
It's an anti anxiety med which seems to work well for people with adhd
"Hello, I'm sorry it didn't work for you"
"I noticed during my uni years that I just needed to find the right study buddies! For me, it was people who weren't like top of the class (because it stresses me out and doesn't motivate me at all, although I know some people find motivation in working with hardworking and top of the class people), who wouldn't distract me when I work but would still be fun to talk to when we feel like taking a break"
"
You can try to find people who struggle to work by themselves just as much as you! Keep going and stay strong, I know how it feels :)"
"Maybe you went into it with a wrong mindset a bit?  

Its not mentioned much in this thread but just look up ""Body Doubling"" online if you havent already, theres a lot of helpful advice on how to approach it so you dont feel bad about yourself.

Also there's online body-doubling services and communities, maybe that could be better for you since the other person would be doing something different, and many people there have ADHD too."
"Your story makes me feel like a privileged asshole because I definitely take access to healthcare for granted.

It's been hard enough dealing with ADHD with (relatively) easy access to therapy and medication"
It really sucks that you and other people have to go without essential healthcare because you weren't lucky enough to be born in a certain place
" 

You should be proud of yourself for handling your situation so well"
I really hope you get the treatment you need (and deserve) in the future.
For best effect the water needs to be 0 - 15 degrees celcius.
Putting your body through small amounts of stressors can actually trigger positive responses in the body
"

Working out, cold plunges, fasting etc"
"can be good.
We aren't built to be comfortable all the time"
"

The stressors of course have to be the right ones, and be of short duration"
"

The constant stress and fight or flight bode is not good for the body longterm"
"It is meant to help you survive an attack by a bear, not too many emails."
"Could be! We perform better under stress, and cold activates our stress response.

There is admittedly a ton of misinformation out there about cold plunges for the general population (the studies that showed a benefit were very flawed) BUT it would make a lot of sense that they could help people with ADHD.

(And misinformation or not, if it makes you feel good, go for it!)"
"Not an expert, but I think just switching off all hot water at the end of the shower could be effective"
Just pushing through with it seems to do part of the work
Your brain has to adjust to avoiding thoughts of fleeing and going against other wants
"It’s a lot like mediation in a way.

Talking about this has made me want to go back to the cold shower at the end ritual and I did feel more in control of what I wanted to do on days I did it"
I also think running a cold bath and plunging could work without the ice
It’s gonna feel like a shock anyway
I have also done the cold plunges at the Korean spa after being heated up and it really is like a brain wash
"Had to tap into all my meditation practice to focus on just one step in front of the other on the ladder getting in cause I hate cold water, but it worked and felt physically great for a prolonged time after"
"It makes sense why people get into it.

I’m rambling, but last advice is to pick a focus like moving your feet as you put yourself under the water"
Focus on some action that isn’t the water touching you itself.
How do you go about it? 
You definitely do not need to be puking to get the brain benefits of exercise
"Enough to get the heart rate up a bit, maybe a little sweat"
"Enough that if you were sleepy in the morning you would feel awake, if you get my meaning"
"And small bursts are good too, like little kids “getting the wiggles out”."
"For me, I have a major improvement in my ability to sit still and pay attention in class when I bike to school as opposed to driving.




Thats like 30 min at 100-150 bpm, which isn't very bintense for me. I'm not trying to show up sweaty but I do have to cimb a 50m hill."
Yep
Proper nutrition is a game changer.
"Lol imagine being able to learn a second language as an adult with adhd, unless you have a strong interest in languages"
that's actually quite common with ADHD meds for people with ADHD
"Yeah I was gonna say, caffeine makes me sleep"
"It should help with self-control, working memory and attention (https://www.telepsychhealth.com/cerebellar-exercises-training-adhd/)

And yeah, you can definitely do balance exercises indoors: martial arts, dancing, yoga"
I personally love VR dancing/rhythm games
Caffeine was my go to for a long time before I was diagnosed
"Nah, def not placebo"
"It’s literally a stimulant, like many classes of adhd meds"
"It’s not as effective as traditional stimulant meds, but does give some of the same benefit"
"Same as coffee/caffeine does— not as strong, but not nothing either."
Any chance France could be a viable destination in your future? 
Wow thanks for sharing
"I had a similar experience, except it was extreme anxiety that fueled me to succeed despite my tendency to procrastinate or not do things the way I should"
"Like you said, the adrenaline, being in constant fight or flight mode, does wonders for battling ADHD 😅 I wasn’t aware of my ADHD until after college, when I finally started counseling and got on medication for my anxiety"
"I suddenly was a lot worse at being productive and doing things on time, and I realized later it was because I no longer had that anxiety pushing me through it"
"Now I’m diagnosed and on medication for my ADHD, and it’s been life changing"
I’m so much happier without the negative reinforcement being the main driver in my life
"Good luck on your journey, I hope you can find what works best for being the best you"
🙂
"Well, I Might be wrong tho, because I remember listening to that information from a doctor, but now researching it, I couldn't find much info - also I found quite opposite in some cases (like Dr"
"Russel Barkley saying that CBT isn't that effective for ADHD), the most proximal thing I could find was this:  
[https://www.scielo.br/j/paideia/a/CQ6tkgCbVWrjsMHdmgSB47n/](https://www.scielo.br/j/paideia/a/CQ6tkgCbVWrjsMHdmgSB47n/)  
Currently I'm Reading ""ADHD 2.0: New Science and Essentials Strategies for Thriving with Distraction - From Childhood Through Adulthood"
Edward M
"Hallowell, M.D"
and John J
"Ratey, M.D."" which the doctors talk about non pharmaceutical choices."
So I'm going to be doing DBT more for better coping skills with stress
I only got a proper diagnosis this month so I've got lots of work to do for both that and focus/time management. 
Could you expand on that? Seems like a good medicine in theory
It’s an antidepressant.
Thanks so much! Your kind words mean everything to me
Wishing you nothing but success and happiness!
"This! 

I have ADHD and while i am medicated, i do put alot of stress of my body, not for selfharm reasons but for strengthening myself"
"

Sometimes i dont eat for a while, sometimes when im cold, i stay cold"
Same for heat
"At times, i dont sleep"
Or hardly sleep anyway
Let your body adapt
"

Getting stronger isnt only by going gym, its also by training your body to handle things you usually cant handly"
"The stress you put yourself through by being too cold, hot, hungry, tired etc is great for you.

Make sure you do it right and your immune system will love you."
"To me, part of it does feel like getting my body back used to discomfort after prolonged comfort"
It’s like immersion therapy in discomfort itself.
Cycling works well for me
It helps that it is also fun and can be a means to an end in itself eg getting to somewhere you need to be. 
Thank you so much ❤️
"I hope it helps you! Some parts of it feel a bit silly at first, but if you're open to it, they really are helpful"
"I didn't do a strict program (ie going through the original workbook in order) but my therapist incorporates many aspects of it into her practice.

For me, the ideas of radical acceptance and  ""both these thoughts/feelings can be true at the same time"" to be very grounding (compared to a classic CBT approach that focuses on changing thoughts)"
Good luck!
Wellbutrin was like I was thinking from the bottom of a well
 I was practically a drooling idiot
 I couldn’t carry a conversation for shit on that drug
 I couldn’t think
 You might as well just have lobatomized me
" 

Guanfaucine made my ADHD worse on its own"
" I would lose everything, walk in to stuff, forget things"
 with adderall I would zone out because it was too strong
 Then it set off my fibromyalgia and gave me stomach issues.
"The conversation part is weirdly relatable, maybe it's actually just the Wellbutrin o.o

I don't have much reference now so I can't remember how it was before I started, but maybe some of my less fortunate quirks is because of it"
I do feel I'm struggling with things I shouldn't most of the time
I didn’t get diagnosed until I was 32
 So any intervention occured post that other then caffeine
 Adderal to me is like upgraded caffeine I’m used to most of the symptoms but I do need to actively take a vacation annually where I stop all stimulant usage.
Appreciate your insights! Vyvanse is next for me most likely
How long / often is the vacation for you?

Please give me some advice :(

Might not work for everyone/might not be relevant to you but I was on lamotrigine already when I started ADHD medication and my psych said he didn’t want to put me on stimulant meds without preemptively raising my lamotrigine dose
"I’m on it for bipolar and he pointed out than stimulant meds and trigger bipolar symptoms (mania mostly, but also worsen depressive crashes)"
He had me go from 100mg of lamotrigine to 200mg and I never had an issue with adverse side effects taking stimulants with it
Everyone’s reaction to meds is different so take this with a grain of salt but might be worth talking to your psych about stimulants making your symptoms worse when you take lamotrigine with a stimulant.
I am on both
Seems to be ok for me

Yap
It's a common thing
I take melatonin and Magnesium that's helped ALOT
Creating a routine helps (I suck at it though)
I make myself go to bed at the same time every night
I don't use my phone in bed (wires your brain up too much)
Bed is only for sex or sleeping
I try to do relaxing things beforehand? Like a bath or yoga
But yeah mainly the melatonin and Magnesium
Do that! Also Ashwaganda morning and night.
Do you wake up in the middle of the night as well? I just started my medication on Adderall XR and I feel pretty tired only 5 hours after I’ve taken it
"I take it in the morning 7am, then my bedtime is around 10pm"
"I can’t fall asleep easy to save my life, but that’s always been a problem of mine"
My concern is how the past two nights I’ve woken up suddenly
"

I did just get some dental work done, and my tooth is still sore from that, so I’m hoping it’s just my tooth hurting that’s making me up."

Is adderall 15mg XR (once a day) equivalent to 15mg IR (twice a day) ?

No
It's equivalent to two doses of 7.5mg IR.
15 XR is 15 TOTAL for the day
"So for example, 30 MG XR would be equivalent to taking two 15 mg IR, one in the morning and the other in the afternoon."
No
15 mg XR = 15 mg period
You're getting 7.5 mg x 2

Did you take any meds during this time? Asking because I desperately need to change my sleep cycle and can’t seem to manage it
I can never fall asleep before midnight
I take my concerta at 8:30 every morning.
I hate the fact it's terribly unhealthy to do so..
but it's either sleeping or being in a peace of mind...
I'm unmedicated but I took tylenol just in case I had a sudden headache.

"I just KNOW my partner is gonna come home and either find it immediately, or half a week will pass and he randomly finds it in some obscure place and asks me why on earth I put it there, like I'm some crazy person"
"My dude, I have once walked towards my dorm while talking to a friend on the phone, only to start frantically patting my pockets and telling him ""shit, I need to turn around, I think I left my phone at school""..."
"The situation isn’t helped in our house by my wife’s habit of stacking things up and putting them on top of some random thing I’ve put down.

I have lost count of the number of times I’ve “lost” something only to discover it months later at the bottom of a pile of her stuff 😐

Which makes up for me delaying us leaving the house every time because I’ve lost the car keys, phone or glasses in the 5 metre walk between the kitchen and the front door 😢"
"Ouch, that sounds very frustrating!"

I agree
"If you look online for adhd assessments, they are entirely different"
I found a self assessment that was spot on
Then another was pretty much asking if I was suicidal! I’ve never been suicidal

Ritalin (methylphenidate) and Vyvanse (lisdexamphetamin) are different compounds which cannot be compared 1 to 1
I've always been told that dexamphatamine (Adderall/Tentin) is twice as strong as Ritalin
"Vyvanse, however, is lisdexamphetamine, you have to divide by 2,8 to get to the amount of dexamphetamine"
Which means you will need more Vyvanse to equal the effect of the Ritalin.
"My doctor started me on 30mg of vyvanse and I’ve never been on adhd meds before, I felt it a little for 2 days but then nothing, and he doubled it at my last appointment and 60mg seems to be great for me so far"
"Hmm interesting, so I may have shot myself in the foot by requesting a lower dose.

Though it could also be that I'll respond better to the switch over"
"

Thanks for the answer, I thought it was a little the other way around."

I have a specific cup in my bathroom for taking medicine and if I forget I usually just check if the inside of the cup is wet
😂
"I use timer caps, once you open and close the lid it starts counting up to show you how long it has been since you last opened the bottle"
"My script is written to take several small doses of my ADHD meds per day, so every morning when I take my first dose I count out the rest of them for the day and put them in the bottle"
"When I see it has counted up to the time for my next dose (2-3 hours later for example), I take the next one"
It doesn’t make any sounds or anything
"

When I first switched to this regimen I used an app called Medisafe that alerted me when it was time to take my next dose"
"I basically conditioned myself so I no longer need the reminder, I just know when my next dose is"
"So I no longer need this app, just the timer caps.

For my night time pills I really have just trained myself to use a cute miniature daily pill thing"
I only have to refill it every 14 days because I put my nighttime pills on both sides
"


Side note"
I have lived with two people in my adult life who used to steal my meds and gas light me about it
"The timer caps are decent for helping you keep track, but I would still get confused thinking “oh I guess I took it an hour ago and not three, silly me.” So I keep my pills in a lockbox now"
Hence why I only take out the pills needed for the day each day
Also then the max anyone can steal is however many are in the daily container
It forced me to be disciplined
"

I no longer live with thieves but I keep the same routine"
My current roommates that know I’m on meds know not to touch them
I told them when they moved in that I’m done dealing with thieves so I’ll just call the police if they steal any.
"If you have an iPhone, you can set the health app to remind you of your medications or vitamins"
It also has a toggle thingy you use to show if you taken your meds or not.
I don’t get to make my coffee until I’ve taken my meds
"Somehow that’s worked for me, since my vitamins and meds are on a shelf above the coffee cups."
The pill box system works if your rule is to never ever take a pill unless it is from the pill box
Therefore when empty you just have to fill the pill box or have no pills
"Funny enough, the most effective method for me is saying it out loud, even just to myself"
"""8:23am, I've taken my meds."" My freaky auditory memory has my back I guess!"
Add  Vitamin B12
" If you aren't peeing laser yellow, you forgot."
"I have an alarm set, and I don't turn it off until I take the pill"
"I might snooze, but I never stop until I've taken the medication"
System works 99% of the time.
"I intentionally say to myself as I look intently at the med, ""I am taking my pill this morning""

If I can't recall, I don't take it"
Cuz palpations suck
Go old school and get a daily pill container
Day is empty? Have taken pill
Day not empty? “Oh fuck not again”.
I made a little 3d printed stand for my pill bottle with a led light on it that lights up when it’s time to take my pill
You push down on the stand with the bottle to turn off the light when you replace the bottle
"It’s in a highly visible place in my kitchen, so when I pass by and the light is on, I take it"
Been working for three years and best system I’ve had so far
"

I take two different meds, one morning and one night"
I order 90 days worth (less chance to miss a refill) and throw them all together in one bottle (don’t like fussing with two diff bottles or divided containers)
There is a green (morning) and a red (evening) led run by an arduino
"

I do have an alarm set on my phone as a backup"
But I’m very apt to ignore it
Or at least it’s just a reminder to check the light
"Same with pill taking apps: I’ll get distracted in the middle of checking the app and taking the pill, then wonder if I did or didn’t take the pill at all.

Been thinking of making this into a real product"
Drop me a DM if you’d be interested or just curious!
"Amazon PillPack is a service that fills your scripts into individually labeled packets with the date you take it, not sure if they do that for CII drugs but it’s definitely worth looking into!"
"my meds are the capsule with the little balls in them so when u shake it, it sounds like a maraca"
"before i take it, i use it like a lil maraca so my mind will go, „if i shook it, i took it“"
has worked every time so far lol
"I have a week pill box that has smaller boxes for every day of the week with two tins basically for morning and nights, I just use the night one for the second round of ritalin i use and have another week pill box for my antidepressants i take at night!"
"Nice! You can also get those weekly pill containers where you put the pills you need to take each day in the boxes for each individual day, and then you can just look at the day to see if you've taken them"
"Also for as needed medications, you can get pill bottles online that had a clock/timer on the lid, so when you open the bottle you can see when you last opened it to ensure you don't accidentally double up on pills."
"Pill reminder, free and great app, you must check the box when you take so it’s great"
They make lids with timers that reset when you open them
"So if you open them it resets to 0:00 and 5 hours later when you go “, oh shit! Did I take my pills?” You can look and see the timer now says 5:00"
It’s like $12 for two on Amazon and saves lots of mental anguish.
i announce it out loud that i’m taking it lol
I flip the bottle after medication so the bottle rests on the cap when I remember to flip it
Kind of a similar system to yours.
I put my meds in front of my deodorant in the bathroom
I have to move the pills to put deodorant on and I'm good about remembering deodorant.
Timed bottle
I love mine
I take a med that if i double take it its very dangerous so i keep it in a timed bottle
You can get a pill timer cap on Amazon that will count up the number of hours since the last time it was opened
It's very handy for validating I took my meds.
I have a 31 day pill organizer
"It’s not days of the week, just numbers"
I find it really helpful
"Not only can I see if I have taken my meds or not, I also can see when I have 5 or less days of meds and can contact my doctor for a refill"
"

I like the 30 day format because I can put the whole bottle in the pill organizer and then I don’t have to keep track of the bottle."
I struggled with this for literally years
Now I start  with my bottle on the right side of my desk
I take my morning dose and then set it in the left side
"When I take my noon dose (alarm is set), i move it back to the right"
"

I'm embarrassed at how easy it is now, and how long it took me to think of this"
I bought pill bottle lids that have a timer on them so it shows how long it’s been since the bottle was last opened
"another method that works for me, most phones have inbuilt pill trackers"
i set it to send me a reminder notification to take my pills a few minutes before i wake up so its the first notification i see
"as i take it, i’ll mark it as “taken” in the app"
"if i forget if i’ve taken it or not, its a simple app check away"
"

its not perfect, because there is the chance you forget to mark it as taken and double dosing really isn’t pleasant in my experience"
but i’ve built it into a morning routine for myself so i never really forget anymore.
"I have a subscription device that alerts me, dispenses the pills and then annoys me until I go get the cup"
I still have to actually take the pills but I put the cup somewhere annoying until that happens.
"I have a bottle with measurements, fill it every morning, each time I take a pill I drink a quarter of it"
(4 pills a day)
"this is a good tip, but I also highly recommend the app Theraview! Very easy to log the dosage and then you get a notification when the meds are kicking in, when they’re starting to wear off, and when they’ve fully worn off. "
"me, realizing I haven’t taken mine today 😳"
"Brilliant, I'm switching to this tonight! I've been flipping the bottle upside down after taking it, and flipping it back over before bed, but sometimes I forget and have to count out the pills"
"This method seems foolproof, and I definitely need that"
You just reminded me to take my birth control pill
"I turned off the alarm thinking I'd grab it within seconds, got distracted, and forgot to take it an hour ago"
Thank you!
"I have a little weekly pill organizer, I keep it in my backpack and take it to work every day and take my meds there"
Only way I’ll remember otherwise I’ll leave the house without taking them
I have a glass water bottle next to my bed that I fill up every night
"I have an alarm set to wake up, take my meds, then go back to sleep for about an hour (or until it kicks in and wakes me up)"
"If I wake up after that alarm and see the bottle is still full, then I know I didnt take it"
"If its missing half or more, I can assume I took it."
They sell lids on Amazon that say the date/time the cap was last opened.
"My system, in case it would help anyone, is this:

I keep my meds on my bedside table in plain view"
"I see the bottles when I wake up, take the meds, and put the bottles back down **upside down**"
"Because putting them back upside down is a very deliberate and otherwise unnecessary step, it's hard to forget to do it! So essentially, if they're right side up, I haven't taken them yet, if they're upside down, I did"
"(If it's morning and they're upside down, I forgot to flip them over before bed"
Time to take the meds and put the bottles back upside down again.)
i have a once-daily prescription for straterra
i put a hairband around the mouth of the bottle under the lid when i take the pill in the morning and take it off around lunch or bedtime.
Usually take it and go back to lay down
"If I go back to sleep, I probably didn’t take it"
But idk anxiety also propels me awake sometimes
"I know you said pill boxes don’t work, but I bought this one on Amazon and refill it every/every other Sunday as part of my “getting ready for the week” routine"
I take them in the morning so I lowkey basically fill them for 2 weeks instead of the 7 days https://a.co/d/4sMkZzn
"I’m not sure if android has it, but on iOS, in the Health app, you can put your medications in there"
"The name, dosage, look of the pill/capsule/liquid, etc.
You can also set “Time Sensitive” reminders - so it will give you a notification banner that won’t go away until physically swiped away, that then sits in your notification list"
"
You can tap on it when you take your meds, say taken and it will log the time you take it (which you can adjust manually too if you forgot to mark it off)"
"This also helps to keep a track of what you’ve taken and when, so if you’re taking short acting meds, you know when you’re due for your next one if you were late on your first one"
"
It’s been a game changer for me"
"Would highly recommend for everyone using an iPhone in this sub to take a good long look through the Health app and set everything up correctly! And if Android has similar, same there."
I have to take mine with food and tons of water or I get a 2 day migraine so I make breakfast and I keep the meds close to the plate with a full closed water bottle
"If there’s food on the plate or the water is unopened, I haven’t taken my meds lol"
"I know it didn't work for you, but the weekly pill boxes work for me! It's on my bedside table with my phone and water bottle, so I take it when my first alarm goes off, and then snooze for 20 more minutes before I have to get up.

As for refilling it, I usually do it midweek because I'm procrastinating some other task"
"I do admin/low priority tasks when putting off high priority/stress tasks and pill refill is one of them.

Each day has a Vyvanse, a 5mg Dexi and an Iron tablet (to take when I go to sleep because it has Vitamin C in it)"
"The dexi is optional, so at the end of the week I might have a few dexis left, and maybe 2-3 iron tablets because I don't remember those everyday oops"
But the Vyvanse is always remembered/taken!
I have a spot on my night stand where I keep my meds
The bottle is placed on the jewelry box on the nightstand each night
First thing In the morning I take the bottle off and take my meds and leave it off the jewelry box
"At night when I plug my phone in to charge, the bottle goes back on the jewelry box"
These physical reminders help me to know for certain
On your pill bottle take a sharpie and put a giant x or $ sign on the lid
When you take your pill flip the bottle
If it’s not flipped you didn’t take it
If it is you did take it
Just remember that the next morning
"
-I have several adhd and that worked

I’ve also used the daily pill boxes with little doors for each day."
I don’t have ADHD
I’m on the sub to support my husband
"

I do however have a disease and am on a lot of meds"
I take a picture any time I take any meds
"

That way, I know exactly what I took and what time"
"

I have been doing this for years and years now.
It’s super important for me as well because in an emergency, we know exactly what I took when and if I’m unresponsive for any reason, someone can check my phone to see my last doses."
"I have a monthly pill box and it has worked better for me than the weekly ones.

I have an app on my phone that sends persistent reminders every 5 minutes"
I have trained myself to not hit complete until the pill is in my mouth
"I can snooze it in increments too like an hour if I am focusing or know I need to eat something first.

App is called Due."
I have a pill bottle with a timer on it that counts up from the last time it was opened
"If it's over 24 hours, I haven't taken my meds today"
"The only way I can screw it up is to take a pill out and put it down somewhere, and in that case the worst thing that can happen is missing a day - I can't double-dose.

I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be able to handle your system"
"You have to know what day of the week it is, remember to put something in a designated location, and correctly identify the designated location based on the day of the week, all first thing in the morning before your meds kick in? That's impressive."
I use a pill reminder app
"It reminds me at 5:30am daily.....kinna helps that I keep my pills right on or beside my bed AND my loving partner asks ""had your meds today"" every single day 😩"
I just take another one and if I go comatose it means I took it
" Jk, taking my meds is the first thing I do upon waking before ANYTHING else"
" Even if i need to pee real bad, meds first."
Pill box
I have a note qith rhe days and they get crossed out the aecound i swaallow.
I use medisafe app on my phone and works wonders for me! You can set a time for it to alert you and set up reminders if you haven't marked it as taken
"I used to use pill bottles with timer caps that I got cheaply on Amazon, but I recently entered my medications into Apple Health so now I get reminders on my watch and phone to take my meds and can mark it off when I take it"
"Your system sounds great and simple, too! The best routine here is the one you'll actually make a habit, whatever that is."
Yours is a great i idea
I move my bottle between two spots
"It's with my other meds, so when i take my evening meds, it gets shifted back along with others i take the same way."
I use an app called Medisafe
It's exactly what you're looking for!
Create a larger more memorable action around taking the pill
" 

I will only take my pill with some food, and I'm eating the food so I can take the pill.

If i'm in doubt, and I have the freedom ( day off or something) i might just skip it that day"
" I will know within an hour or two if it's in my system, and if it's early enough, I can take it a couple hours late.

If it's a daily or regular problem, I would highly suggest getting a monthly pill planner, every time you get your month's supply home, immediately transfer it to the day planner."
"I have my pill bottles in plain sight, and my alarm is set for everyday."
I love this! Thank you! The pill box worked well for me for a while until I forgot to fill it… and then that was that!
Pill boxes work if you fill the previous day (but not the current day) after taking your pills
"That way, if the Wednesday tray is empty on Wednesday, then you have taken it already"
"Otherwise if the Tuesday is empty and Wednesday is full, then you take Wednesday pills and fill up Tuesday"
"The way I get myself to refill the pill box is 1) since all my meds are in the morning, I place it on my pillow when I empty it, 2) I always give my cats treats when I refill it.

Part 2 has the dual boon of making refilling my pills more fun, and training my cats to come running when they hear certain sounds, which gives me a way to always find them if needed."
I’m lazy so I just use 2 pill bottles
"Every night I load the meds for the morning in one bottle, and then another bottle for my nightime meds."
I've had a couple things
First I had pill bottle caps that would start a timer once I opened it up and took my pill
But they were cheap and stopped working after a while
"I could look up more reliable ones, but instead what I did was took an spare string light I had, set up a shortcut in iOS so that when I tap the lid of the bottle (where I've taped an NFC tag), it marks the pill taken off on my reminders app, and it turns on the light in the closet and makes it green"
"I just leave that on all morning until I leave for work and every time I see the green light, I know I'm good to ""go."""
I view my pill bottle like an hour glass
I just turn it over in the morning when I've taken it
And turn it back around when get off work
I've still fucked it up a couple of times.
"A paper calender on the wall, a pen attached to the pill bottle (kept separately from the calender!)"
Take a pill - make a mark on the calender
No mark - I forgot
"It's what I used to do with other meds.

Rigt now, it's simpler - if it's time for a break at work, it's time to take my meds"
"Like, breakfast break - I take my 50mg"
Lunch break - 20mg
"I just go, wash my hands, get my hand cream, and my meds are right there, so I see them and remember to take them as a part of what I always do during a break."
I take a mid-day dose while I'm at work
My weekly pill box is right above my head
I literally just have to raise my arm and open the little cabinet above my desk and take it out
I don't even have to stand to do this
"And do you know how many days I'm late taking my ""very addictive"" medication? EVERY DAY."
My wife takes a ton of pills and doesn't have ADHD
So she sets up my pills in a shot glass every evening
"And then she checks the shot glass every morning after 8am or so.

I still often forget.

If I didn't have her, I think I'd set up an alarm on my phone to remind me"
But I'm fairly sure I'd turn the alarm off without taking the pills most days
So I don't know what I'd do.
"I took a selfie with the medication on my tounge every time I took it, it helped a lot!😂💯"
I just have a morning routine established
Every day when I wake up the first thing I do is I go into my office and grab a diet Dr Pepper for some caffeine to help me wake up
All my meds are right there ready to go and I grab them at the same time and take them.
"My system for remembering whether I've taken my pill doesn't work for anyone but me.

My wife can tell"
" Apparently, when I'm not on my meds, I eat with my mouth open, and when I'm on them, I don't"
" I never notice the difference, but she reliably does."
I keep my bottle in the same exact visible location and use the Medisafe app
Also take it not too long after I wake up.
i have a task set on my calendar that i need to mark completed
also i turn my pill bottles upside down after i take them and flip them back over in the evening before bed.
"That sounds like a great system! I thought pill boxes wouldn’t work for me, but I found one that did! I have a lot of meds; so it’s perfect for me"
I also set an early alarm and take my meds; then go back to bed so I can “wake up” more easily
I find slower transitions help with things.
I actually take all my meds right before bed (pharmacist said this is cool) as I’m really bad at remembering to take them/ if I’ve taken them at any other time of the day
Maybe you can schedule in a time to refill the pillbox to do it on your phone or  other smart device like echo dot to remind you to do it
"I flip the bottle upside down after my first dose, and right side up after the second"
It took a while to get the muscle memory down but now it's automatic so I trust it.
I had sticky note on my pill container where I wrote the date just in case when I started (just make sure you write right after taking the pill if you are prone to getting distracted)
"Fortunately I don't mostly forget if I took one or not, but it seemed to work for the few times I did."
I rely on the misery I get from not taking them to motivate me I to remembering
"I had to get on a nonstim, bc no matter what system I used, I could not remember to take my stim"
The only thing that helped me to remember a stim was combo with a nonstim
LOL!
"I have a pill box that I got from Amazon, it has six compartments and you can set timer for specific times of the day"
Battery powered and it is loud.
Timer caps tell you how long it's been since you opened the bottle.
I bought this pill bottle that shows when it was last opened
It has been very helpful
"If i look and its around 24 hrs, I know i havent taken my pill yet today.
https://a.co/d/d9s3Rdq"
Daily pill minder and I text my wife when I take them.
I have a weekly twice a day holder
I fill it weekly.
Say it out loud
"""I am taking my asprin"""
I read it here and tried it successfully!
I use the medications app on my phone to schedule and mark as taken… mostly
It's funny to me that you can remember to move the bill bottle every day not fill the pill box once a week
Funny because I know for 100% certainty I'd never remember to move the bottle - or constantly second guess if I put it in the right spot.
Daily pill box for a week
I fill it up every Sunday
Every day when I grab my keys I check to see if there's pills in my pill keychain container
"I get breakfast on the way to work, and I have a permanent reminder every day at the same time to take my medicine"
"Eat breakfast, take pills, dismiss alarm."
I use an app Medisafe and I made it routine to press the button once I pop one.
I use TickTick - and have medication as a reoccurring task that pops up everyday
"You can put a time that you want to be reminded.

If you have Apple - reminders may do the same thing"
I flipped my prescription bottles upside down in the basket when I take the pill
"So if I forget later and wonder if I took the pill, I just look and if the pills are cap down, I know I took  them."
"I take my pill bottle out of my top dresser drawer for my morning dose, and then I leave the bottle on top of the dresser for my noon dose  (when home all day)"
"

I notice the pill bottle now and then in the lead up to the second dose, and when I take the noon dose, I put the bottle back in the drawer"
"

On a good day"
"

This slowly developing, much revised, often forgotten routine, plus a phone audio reminder, gives me a better shot at not forgetting."
I bought a 28-day pill organizer on Amazon
"It has four 1-week containers, which all sit in a single larger square container"
"If the day is empty, I've already taken it"
"

This works particularly well since ADHD meds can only be refilled every 28 days"
"So as soon as I get a refill I put them in the organizer, and I put the leftovers into a single pill bottle"
I try to refill at exactly the 28th day so I end up with a couple leftover
"

The leftovers are perfect for exceptions, e.g"
"those times when refills get delayed (like on vacation or if I'm not up for doing a refill), or I lose some, or whatever."
Dry erase board behind your bottle with weekdays
Tick a box for each day you've taken one.
I turn my pill bottle upside down.
"I use a pill box, but I don’t always fill it"
"My meds bottles are all in a zippy bag and depending on where on the counter they are, it means I did take them or not"
"I should mention that I have evening meds too, so basically I change them to a higher part of the kitchen counter at night"
"In the morning, if the bag is in that spot, I need to take my meds"
"If they are on the lower part, I took them."
"I use Google tasks, set a recurring task with a notification every morning and only ✅ exactly at the same time as I take my pill."
I have blood pressure meds along with an antidepressant I take every day
If I skip the antidepressant I can get vertigo or brain zaps
"

So my strategy: get high blood pressure so you have the fear of god in you about taking your meds and take something that will make you uncomfortable if you skip it, classically conditioning/torturing you into remembering them"
"🤪

I also use a weekly rainbow pill box and leave them in the absolute middle of everything in the bathroom so I can’t miss them"
(My boyfriend is an absolute saint).
"i have made a shortcut on my iphone, accessable in the control center and in my lock screen, when i press it it asks if i took 10 or 5 mg, and then creates an calendar entry.

it also tracks how many i have left, but thats just a lil bonus"
"I use ""Track My Pills,"" which is an app used for just that"
"It sounds an alarm at the same time every day to remind me to take them, and then buzzes my phone non-stop until I mark that I've taken them"
I made it as annoying as possible to help get me to take them right away
"

I also track my other non-essential meds with it."
A medication organizer saves all this struggle by setting a daily alarm for time to take it and a weekly alarm on Saturday night to reorganize
Straterra completely eliminated my ability to forget my meds though.
Reminders app on iPhone
"Daily reminder, mark it done!"
"IR users don't have such weakness 😎

(It's impossible to forget that I took a pill then immediately worked for 4 hours)"
I keep the bottle in a drawer in my nightstand
"Before bed I plug my phone in, set my alarm, and put one pill in a little dish right next to it."
"For important meds, I write down the time and dosage of each pill I take in a daily reminder book.

I also turn the pill bottles upside down after taking a pill"
 I later reset their positions at night.
"I have a short memory span for things like this and when I started taking antidepressants yrs ago I started using the Round app on iphone which both gives you several reminders which you can set to different reminder windows (2hr window, 1 hr, 30 min etc)"
"Also the great part about it in my opinion is that you can put in the exact medication, it's dosage, strength, and how many pills you have so it will track when you take it and give you a reminder when you're getting low (which you can set to a specific amount)"
Plus it will show you a day view with the time frames for taking the medication(s) with how many of each to take AND timestamps what time you took it (which I love)
All in all this is the only way I've been able to remember to take my meds and it's been both the most convenient and easiest way to track it for me
:)   Hope this helps!
"Saying ""I took my pill"" firmly to myself is a little bonus to help me remember"
It sticks in my brain that way
"My sacred morning habit is to feed the cat, go into the bathroom and hit my daily pill strip, go back and see if the cat needs more food (yes), then make coffee.

This works most of the time, but I still manage to forget about one day out of every fourteen"
"TBH, I’m more concerned about ensuring I take my blood pressure medicine, the ADHD pill is just tagging along in that pill strip."
This does not work if you have a cat
😆
Did this remind anyone else to take their meds? 🙈
"Medisafe app!!! 

Could always try marker X's/numbers on your hand?"
"I can't seem to be consistent with this either, I've tried phone apps, weekday pill organizers, and habit formation.."
"the only thing that has worked is having the bottle be in my vision, one foot to my left of where I sit to work, and take it immediately after my protein-full breakfast."
I use a countdown the days till app then I plug in whatever day equals the number of days till my meds are gone
"Then if I have to recount them, I at least know what today should have been 😂"
"Only applicable if you use an iPhone, but I use a Health medication reminder plus an Apple Watch alarm that repeats daily"
" 

Apple health can be set to remind you 20min later if you don’t tap the “I took it” button"
"And since it records the answer, you know you did it"
"The alarm is just a backup to get my attention more than a standard notification.

It’s been a lifesaver."
"I don’t understand this, my brain not working always reminds me."
If I can think and sit still that's usually a pretty good sign that I took my pill.
Some pharmacies (I know Amazon does) will fill your prescriptions in daily pouches
"If you have an/pm meds, it'll also do them too"
I have a note in my notes app where I write “pills after 2 pm” or whatever (it’s regarding when the *next* time I should take them is) as soon as I take it
No current note? I haven’t taken them yet.
You could take the pill in front of the mirror ? Maybe
Flip the bottle upside down in the morning
Only have one pill in the container on your Keychain for the afternoon.
My phone has a pill reminder
I have a samsung
I'm guessing apple probably also has it as well
"

Hope those helps!"
Routine routine routine
I cannot stress this enough
My schedule on the weekdays (the days I work) is practically the same every single day - and I do understand this is not possible for all schedules
"

But I take my pill at the same time every day, except for Saturday and Sunday when it’s usually an hour or two later"
I take it right when I get up
"I’ve been doing this for 10 plus years and the routine helps me thrive.

I hope you find a routine or system that works for you"
I hope this helps someone ☮️
Playing with fire on this one but I put it away in a box on my dining room table
"If it's still away neatly, I definitely didn't take it yet"
If it's out on on the table it's 50/50.
I pour myself a full gkass of water when I make breakfast
I yake my medsstraight after I eat
So if any water is missing it means I've taken my meds
It's not foolproof but it seems to help
I've also been thinking about getting a daily pillbox or getting the meds put in those blister packs
I do generally have more tablets left at the end of a month than I should.
Little switches on the pill bottle just switch it when take it
They're on Amazon
I WFH and leave them on my desk under my monitor stand
"After I take my morning dose, I turn the bottle upside down"
"Then after I take my afternoon dose, I turn the bottle right side up again"
It mostly works...
I have no system
I have to dump all the pills out and count back to when I picked it up
It has a 50% accuracy.
"Thanks so much OP, this is genius!!!"
"I have a see through pill box with a section for each day of the week on my nightstand so I can quickly see if I already took them, and then at night I have a reminder for bc in the app finch so I can go physically check off that I did it (also at a time of day that tends to be less chaotic so it usually works)"
"Simple, if I ever question whether I've taken my pill, I take one"
" If I'm gritting my teeth inside an hour, then I did indeed take my pill the first time."
"I have the container with the days, I also take other meds so I have to make sure it happens"
i have an app that i’ll instantly log when i take them
If I’m out and about and I notice I’m making sense and holding adult conversations then I know I took my meds.
"I used to use the weekly pill organizer but then I kept putting off refilling it and grabbing my pills from the bottle, now I just line up the order of my pills for the day the night before when I take my last pill on my coffee table and just take them when it's time,  I don't have to worry about having loose pills around rn so I guess that's why it works for now"
Something that you know your going to put your hands on 1st thing in the am
When I wanna remember important stuff I leave it with my car keys.
I use the [Pillo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.rtrvr.pillo&hl=en_US&pli=1) app
It's so fucking annoying that I have never missed a dose since I started this fall.
I have a pillbox that actually has an annoying alarm that reminds me to take my pills
My students are great because I set t down in about 8 different places
"As soon as it goes of,  one of them finds it hands it to me with my water bottle."
Take a fish oil supplement with your pill and you can taste it in your mouth haha
My wife and I have all of our coffee stuff in a cupboard
"We get up, she makes the bed and I make coffee to start the day"
My pill bottle is right in front
Part of my ritual is taking it out of the cupboard along with the coffee stuff
"The only way I’m allowed to put the bottle away is by taking a pill and instead of placing it down on the counter, I put it away"
"If the pill bottle is in the cupboard, then I took my pill"
Ez pz
"I use an app called pill reminder, I like that it has the option to reschedule the time for the next pill if you take one late which is helpful if you take short acting meds and thus more than one pill a day"
"I will open the app, take my pill out and swallow it and then tick it off as soon as I take it before I close the app, otherwise I start to second guess whether I actually took it or just noticed that it was time to take it."
I once forgot to take my sertraline (100mg) for three days and it made me so dizzy that I passed out in class when I was in college
"Guys be careful, I learned my lesson there"
I count out 7 and put them in another bottle in the draw - they are my order next script now
"
Then I keep 7 in a bottle on my bedside table"
I start on Monday and then can count back to see if I have taken them or not
If I accidentally skip a dose it goes into the order script now bottle
"
Refill the bedside one each week until there are no tablets left - order meds and switch bottles for the last week"
Repeat with the next script.
I have my Navigator yell at me until I do
They sell timer caps on Amazon that tell you how long it's been since you opened the bottle.
My kid forgets to take theirs wayyyy too often
" So, morning and night, they video record themselves taking their meds and they send it to me.

Anyone struggling to take theirs or forgetting if they did could record a video and delete the next day.

I’d suggest sending it to me, but that might crash my text messages!  🤣🤣"
"Last thing I do before I leave the house, I added it to the keys wallet cellphone metro card pat down.

Edit; the other thing I do is keep a few doses of my IR meds (along with a few doses of my other dailies) in a little pill container in my purse"
"If I feel fucked up at 10am and can’t think, it’s time to take my meds because I forgor."
Get a pill box with week days.
"I have an alarm on my phone, but I usually turn it off and forget"
Im here to learn new tricks
"i got a thing you stick to the side of the medicine bottle with a switch for each day of the week that i love (this post did remind me to take my meds tho ngl)
 i know they make caps with a timer too but they all seem made to fit american pill bottles"
"One day if I finally manage to get meds for this hell, I'll have a near infinite amount of ways to remember that I took my pills that I will forget to or procrastinate looking up on reddit."
"Honestly, if I wasn't also on a birth control pill, I'd be unsure if I took my meds or not a LOT.

(For the unfamiliar, hormonal birth control pills (at least all the brands I've ever gotten) come in a pack of four weeks worth of pills, with the days of the week on the top - it's very easy to tell if I've missed a day, and since I take all my meds at the same time, if I forgot the bc, I forgot my brain pills too 😬)"
Someone posted a few days ago about a pill dispensing bottle from Amazon
It has a reset timer on it
Never looked it up but it helped this person
And this post3e suggested to use Google assistance
"My friend gave me a great tip, when you wake up in the morning, embedded a pill into one of these routines"
"If you rush, you're going to forget so either wake up, pop a pill and then get going or take it before you shower or after etc"
It must be in close proximity to routine patterns because efforts are a futile slippery slope.
I put out a little dish now (used to have a lamp with a rounded base but it broke) next to my bed at night and put my morning pill in it to make sure I take it
"I usually take it when my boyfriend goes to work, go back to sleep for an hour or two, and wake up somewhat more ready to take on the day!"
Have you ever tried the medication reminder in the health app on your phone? That helps me a lot.
"Pill boxes work for me because I take 8 pills every morning and I get annoyed having to open the bottles, and I’ve gotten in the habit of filling it every Sunday morning, but I will say before I was on so many meds (when it was like 2-3) I NEVER remembered to fill it so I understand how it might not work for everyone.

I use the Finch app (I LOVE birds) for specific reminders because it adds little rewards for completing tasks and I do have a reminder in there for my meds too just to cover my bases"
"Also good for remembering to eat lunch, load the dishwasher, track my spending, etc"
because it’s a checklist!
I have a basic weekly pill box that's labelled with a letter for every day of the week
I leave the box open and empty for the last one I took so I can keep track
"I keep the pill bottle on the desk in my bedroom and just refill as I go/when I feel like it since I use that desk every night for skincare.


It's also useful as it gives me a heads up for when I'm going to run out of meds because I'll notice the bottle getting low 6 days earlier than otherwise"
"That, and I've added Google calendar reminders set for every 30 days."
I flip the bottle upside down after I take it and reset it right side up before bed
It’s not perfect but 90% of the time it works every time
"Argh, usually when I start missing important shit lol like meetings."
Pill calendar
" You just gotta do it, man"
 Some meds don't mess you up too bad if you double up or miss them
 Others will provide a strong reason to get good at it
 I realize it's very challenging.
"I have to wear glasses in order to function at all, so I put them on and take my meds at the same time"
"If I don’t have my glasses on, I didn’t take my meds"
"If I can see, I took my meds.

But wait! I have three pills to take (Vyvanse, atomoxetine, and a B12 supplement)"
"How do I make sure I don’t get distracted? (I have three children; this used to be a fairly big concern when they were younger.)

I have a small basket on my nightstand that my pill bottles go in"
"When I put my glasses on, I simultaneously put the pill bottles outside of the basket"
"Then I take each pill by picking up the bottle, getting the pill out, closing it up and putting it into the basket, then swallowing the pill."
"I just count how many pills are left in my bottle and compare it with the expected amount assuming I took them every day, up until the present day.

I like the timer cap suggestion from u/MissManicMystic though"
" Anything that requires a system in advance, such as putting the pills in a special place, divider or organizer, is simply not going to work for many people with ADHD"
 But a cap which on its own tells you when you last used it?  That's a great idea!
"I take it at the same time as my birth control every day, so I just check my BCP day to see if today's has been taken or not"
Been doing it for so long its habit at this point
"Alarm, and they sell pill bottle caps that show how long since it was opened"
Medisafe has been a GAME CHANGER
It's an app that reminds you morning and night to take your pills
"Try it out, it's free."
"For me, since my meds are once a day, I flip them over once I take them."
Pill bottle is on my bedside table in plain view
After I take my pill I flip it over
Before I go to bed I flip it right side up.
Ooh this one could be worth trying! I also constantly forget to fill the pill boxes
Only problem is that mainly going to help stop me from double dosing
"

I need something that will help me remember BEFORE I get to work lol"
I use the app Round
"Every morning, I put my coffee by my pill bottle when I brush my teeth"
"I’m not allowed to pick my coffee back up until I’ve had my pill, and I take a sip of coffee right after I’ve taken my pill and move the coffee."
I have an alarm that goes off everyday at pill time.
"I love how LIFE CHANGING tips always seem a) so creative I can’t believe I didn’t think of that but also b) the simplest dumbest thing LOLLLL 

gotta love our brains!"
I bought a timer pill dispenser once
It's pretty nice n organized lol
To fill it when it's out
 Well
I use a weekly pillbox that has a small container for every day of the week as I take a multiple pills including my ADD meds.
"I have an alarm set for every day of the week, twice a day, so I remember I am supposed to be taking meds"
"

I frequently can’t remember if I took it when I was supposed to so once I take a pill out in the morning, I flip the pill bottle upside down"
"Next time I look at it, I know I already took it"
I flip it right side up when I take my second dose
"

I forget everything else I have tried so far lol"
"Put it somewhere you always go, I.e"
"in the breakfast cabinet, when you take one pill prepare the next days pill in a small container so it’s ready to go."
Pill sorter
i saw someone say they turned the bottle upside down once they took it and i’ve been doing this for a week and it works well
Timed medicine cap
It says the time since last opened on it
Worth it.
They sell pop-up day things that can hook around your bottle
It worked for me for awhile until I forgot to pop the days.
but they might work for someone else
Your system seems better.
multiple scheduled alarms
the alarm for when it needs to be taken and then several follow up alarms to cue and make sure you do if you didn't.
"Fill the boxes , do it"
Put an alarm on your phone you do it every Saturday morning
It's the key to your happiness
Atomic habit
For the love of God - you people are all living without med bottle lid timers!? They are like $8 on Amazon
Get you some.
"Well, I take Indayo which lists the weeks and days of week on them"
It’s a 3 month birth control though that I use for Endo
"

Some pharmacies offer a pill packaging service that they’ll label each pill into a push packet"
Might be worth checking.
I forget everyday but i will try this sounds good!
I turn them upside down as I take them
I did get a monthly pill keeper and it’s the best I’ve ever been
"It’s a bigger lift to do it once a month, but then it’s done"
I confess my spouse helps me fill it though!
I have a rule for myself that I’m not allowed to brush my teeth in the morning until I’ve taken my pills.
"> Pill boxes don't work for me because I never fill them.

If you refuse to take a pill that isn't in the box, you'll always remember to fill it"
Don't administer pills directly from the bottle.
"My god, people"
"Just fill your damn pill boxes, and leave the caps open for the days you’ve already taken so you don’t have to think about what day it is."
I use GoodRx for my prescriptions anyways to see where it’s cheaper but they also have a remind system thing
I take mine twice a day
"I always remember to take them in the morning, never remember to take them in the afternoon, until it’s too late."
I keep my meds next to my bed and I move them off the shelf and put the bottles on the bed once I’ve taken them!
I have a pill alarm 80 min before I wake up
"By the time 80min has passed, my brain is already starting to wake up, so Im sorta already “awake” for my alarm"
"If I don’t wake up easily, I know I forgot to take my pill, panic, and take it immediately."
[Timer caps](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Pillzar-Portable-Pill-Dispenser-with-Smart-Timer-Cap-for-Medication-Prescriptions-Supplements-and-Vitamins-Perfect-for-Travel-or-Home-Use/5175302750)
If you haven’t taken your meds surely you can tell like half an hour later.
Am I the only one who can tell within 20 mins if I took it or not? I’ve def forgotten before but my stomach will tell me lol
I use [this app](https://github.com/AdamGuidarini/MediTrak).
Place pill bottle next to bed
"If it’s before 9am and I’m awake, i remembered."
I put a post it on the outside of my pill bottle and write the day on it when I take my pill
I keep them in my brixley bag that is constantly on me! It’s just like the birth control gals that keep it in their wallet😅 I’m super busy & easily forget
A travel pill keychain is also helpful if you have boosters!!
I use Finch to track my daily habits
One step before the “bird” goes on an adventure in the morning is “take your pills”
Works wonders for me!
I have a cute little lamp I flip on when I've taken them and flip it off again at the end of my work day 🙃
I have an order I take my pills in along with my breakfast shake
Usually it's muscle memory enough that once the shake is made I just immediately start to grab the first bottle in the line.
That still seems prone to error
It could take only one attentional error to become unsure if you've taken the present day's dose from the whole bottle.
"Each morning I take all my pills, vitamins, supplements, etc out of the pill basket on my counter and line them up on the kitchen island"
As I take them I put them back in the pill basket on the counter.
I am afraid of taking pills
Not when I’m on Ritalin
So if I panick taking Ritalin I have not taking it
"If I don’t panick, I already take it"
Works fantastic for me
I started putting my meds in the bathroom cabinet
It requires work to get to it so it's easier to remember
Might helpful to flip the bottles upside down or something too.
"Just thinking about how we count doses at work (I'm a pharmaceutical analyst); maybe a tally counter/clicker like [this](https://houseofthobes.co.uk/cdn/shop/products/s-l1600_3_800x.jpg?v=1674580094) could help? 

Put next to someone's meds, so they click it whenever they take a dose, 1-7 (or 1-14 if they have to take twice a day, etc), resetting it at the end of the week."
I have a tracking system in my calendar
"Every day I take it, I put a little tick on the date, and I mark out when I changed to a blister pack/ package"
"That way, if I also forget to put in the tick, I can count the number of ticks since I switched to the new pack, and the number of pills left, to figure out if I've taken one and forgot the tick, or forgotten to take it at all..."
Flip the bottle upside down
I don’t have room for labels
I remember to fill my pill box.
Another thing that you can do is write the days of the week on the blister with a soft pen
"I can't use a pill box for my adhd medication because my pills don't respond well to moisture, but writing on the blister is less work anyways"
"(We don't really have actual medicine pills in bottles where I live, only supplements usually come in bottles)"
I like this! Thank you!
For me it's all about routines.
I am a huge fan of timer caps
I used to skip my meds all the time because I couldn't remember if I took them
I'm so much better with the timer cap because I can confirm if I took them or not just looking at the cap
Found a 2 pack for like $15 on amazon
I have a second pill box where I put in seven pills for the week
"When I’m not sure if I took or not, I just count the remaining pills in it and try to remember (or look up) which day it is"
Works pretty well for me.
"it's 7:35 am, my meds reminder alarm goes off at 7:30"
"My meds are within arms reach  
It went off and I swiped it away because I'm too focused reading this thread about remembering to take my meds

If this isn't ADHD with a *touch* of hyperfocus..."
i dunno what is
"I always was terrible for taking my pill, I also personally hated the side effects so I switched to having a self injection instead every three months and it’s made the world of difference."
The amount of fucking pill boxes iv bought and never used because I forget they exist is embarrassing
"I’ll be wondering if I took a pill and ask myself why I don’t own a pill box, you fucking do you absolute twat, atleast 4."
"I have pill bottles with a timer cap on top that tells me how long it's been since the cap was removed for my most important meds.

I found that buying 2 pill organizers and refilling them every 2 weeks was somehow better for my brain than refilling 1 pill organizer every week"
"

I've thought about buying more so I have a months worth in one go"
Helps me visualize when I need to refill my Rx.
"I use this thing 
[Timer Cap pill bottle](https://a.co/d/hiV3ooM)"
Saying what you’re doing out loud is supposed to help
"Like, “I’m taking my medication”, “I’m locking the door”, etc."
I flip the cup upside down after I take it...
I received my prescription in two bottles so I put my 5 pills for the week in one bottle while leaving the rest in the other
"





I had one morning where I counted all the pills because I was worried I accidentally took 2, luckily it was a false alarm but still"
I got a pill bottle off of Amazon that has a last opened timer on it
Works great.
I keep a journal with the pill bottle
"And Mark the time I took it and write 1 sentence about yesterday's experience.


At the end of the month I try to stay off a few days and write about how the month with. 


3 months of doing this it surprises me how often I skip days"
"And how positive my experience is on the medication. 


My big fear is taking 2 because I forgot I took it"
But I also like keeping track of what I got done
A lot of times I feel like I did nothing but forcing myself to see skipped days productivity vs on days..
Even bad medicated days are better than normal/bad skip days.
I think I’m in the minority here but I remember to take them every morning because I’m overly excited to feel peaceful that it’s the first thing I think about when I wake up lol
I just started meds 2 weeks ago though so that may change when I’ve been on them for longer 🤷🏼‍♀️
This is such an ADHD thing to re create a new system to replace a system made to remind people to do the things! 😂
Building a routine is the strongest path
It took me a while to learn to do exact same thing every morning but now it's basically automatic
"The risk here is that when travelling etc, the routine is easily broken."
If you have an iPhone log them in the health app and it’ll annoy you until you log your medication
 It’s actually really helpful.
I have a pill case but I put 7 per section so I have 1 week each and then take one pill when I get to work
"On days off, I hope and pray I remember"
i flip the bottle upside down once i’ve taken it!! so if i question it i just see the bottle is upside down and know ive already done it
"I’m primarily inattentive, basically no issues with hyperactivity, but when no one else is around and I haven’t taken my pill I’ll get spontaneous bursts of energy and do a random chaotic jump/parkour and immediately think “Huh, I should take my pill” lol"
I had such a hard time remembering if I took my meds
It was a problem
"

Now, I print out weekly calendars (free pdfs online) and keep it with a pen with my meds & vitamins"
"
I keep everything in a small, clear bin out on the counter in my kitchen because of my object permanence struggles"
"
I physically write down what I take when I take it"
"

I’ve tried keeping record on my phone, and it didn’t work"
"The physical act of writing it down, and having it out on the counter so I can’t miss it, was the best help! 

Hope it helps you too :)"
I use the pill box works perfectly but am thinking of getting a bigger one to do once a month in hopes it wil reminds me to re order my meds on Time.
I wish all once per day pills were in packs like birth control - very easy to keep track of.
I have epilepsy so it's imperative that I take my meds and my memory is shit
" I have a phone app (pillo), and an alarm goes off at the time you need to take your med"
 It records your compliance for taking your meds
 On top of that (I have a lot of trouble missing meds)
" I fill a pill box and have an alarm clock next to it, so I have to physically turn it off"
 I can also easily see if my meds were taken when I look at the pill box
" Since I take multiple meds, this is what works for me"
 A med cap alarm  probably works fine if you only take 1 pill
" This may be excessive to some, but I really can't miss my meds, and I am really bad at remembering"
The app is really helpful if I'm not at home
 You can snooze the app alarm if you need to for some reason.
I use an app called Medisafe
I have an android so I'm not sure if it's available for iOS.
Cannot do my hair or makeup without seeing the pills as they're on top of everything I need and in front of the mirror so I can see if I look like a monster lol
Heyo! If anyone is interested in an app I’ve found one I genuinely LOVE
I saw it originally on another Reddit ADHD post
"It’s called Theraview - it’s simple, no ads or nonsense"
 It’s only for adhd meds though
"

The user can set reminders to take their meds as well which is pretty cool."
An alarm and a pill dispenser.:)
struggle with that very thing almost every single morning
What I have gotten pretty good at is taking my pills when I eat breakfast and I tend to do that pretty early before anyone else is awake
"So I’ll lay out all four or five of my pills in the exact same order every day and then I make a point of eating themtaking them, in the same order and generally speaking I know that when I have they’re all gone that I’ve taken them all"
"Ironically, it’s hard to for me to remember or know if I’ve ever taken them or not so there’s a couple of mornings we’re I’ll forget you know you never know for sure"
Whoever said the ADHD was unfair
Absolutely know what they were talking about
It’s a bitch.
"The app, Take Your Pills, has notifications that do not go away until you interact with them"
"Along with having a pill tray thing for every day, this app has been mega helpful."
"*goes to grab pill bottle*

*takes one out* 

*ingests*

*says to self: “I took my meds.”*

*done*"
I have a cup for rinsing after brushing my teeth
I refill it after rinsing so I can take my pills
"If there's water in the cup, I haven't taken them lol."
I do that with my other meds! ADHD is next to bed and I take first thing and .
not so much help
Oh thats smart!
Timer caps are the best! I got one about a year ago and it is so easy to tell when I have missed a dose.
"I did this too, but then the batteries died and I never replaced them (and then I switched pharmacies, so the caps don't fit the new bottles...)"
That sucks that you have that added complication!
Timer caps is the way
Yep - timer caps FTW! I have one bottle with a timer cap at home and another one at work
Looked at the work one yesterday and realized I’d failed to take my second dose for 3 days straight 🤷🏼‍♂️.
"How do you know the cap will fit the bottle? I've been getting different brands every month lately due to the shortages, is there one that fits all of them?"
My wife uses these and they are a lifesaver.
Is there a bigger version of a timer cap? My husband has this nicorette spray stuff that he’s been addicted to for years! Gets up to go pee at night and will spray
"Wake up, spray"
It’s insane
And I think is so quick that he doesn’t even realize he’s doing it
So something big enough to fit roughly a 3” diameter by 6” long item?
"I use the Samsung equivalent of this feature, but I'm usually in the middle of something when my 2pm Adderall reminder pops up, so I say I took it to stop the alert, and then forget to take it"
I wish there was a snooze butto on that afternoon one.
Do not underestimate the ADHD urge to swipe away notifications and not actually do the thing.
"The app Medisafe is also great for this, it's for both iPhone and Android "
"I had this set up and it worked for a couple of days, maybe a week"
Then I just started silencing the alarm after a while and then stopped using it all together
"Funny part is, I didn’t deactivate the notification for like a year lmao"
"""Did I take my medicine and forget to swipe?""

""Did I swipe to shut it up intending to go take my meds right then but got distracted?""

 - Me using that sort of app."
This is what I use now
My therapist actually recommended it to me a few months ago
"Before I was using Daylio, but the free app only really worked if I were taking one medication, but now I take multiple (yay for compounding mental health problems!)

I've found the Health app quite useful!"
I use Alarmy - and set it to not be shut off unless there's a photo of the pill in my hand
"(I do this mostly for my noon hydrocortisone dose, because I have Addison's Disease and you'd think I'd remember to take a pill that's keeping me alive, but.."
"no.) 

I also use this app to wake up and use a bar code scanner to unlock the alarm"
"I scanned a bar code on the back of a particular book, and I put that book out in the hallway"
"I set the alarm to an obnoxiously lots noise with no snooze option and it will only stop if I get up, go find the book and scan the back"
I used to oversleep even with three different alarms set
"Now, I always get up!"
I use this all the time and it’s so helpful!
"I use this, and it worked great at first but I have so many notifications on my phone I just straight up don’t see them anymore :( I don’t know how fix it!"
"I do this, plus a task in my finch app AND I use a pull box with removable days, and after I take my morning meds the box goes with me to the kitchen if I’m home so I’ll have it for my afternoon dose or if I have to leave the house I’ll bring my actual bottle and my phone will remind me."
Same
"I use a pillbox set right in front of my coffee supplies, and I never forget to make coffee."
My secret was getting 6 weeks of pill boxes
"I hate filling my pills, and doing it once a week would drive me batty"
I set aside an hour once a month and do everything that’s empty (and reorder anything that needs a refill)
I then have two weeks of runway in case I was out of anything to pick up the prescription and add missing pills
"

I probably wouldn’t do this for just one pill, but I’d you have several it definitely helps me."
"This, and also I make sure I  always ""run out"" on Friday night, because Saturday morning I have the free time to fill it back up without being cranky."
I got cute pill boxes and I think that helps
There shaped like flowers and the days are the petals in rainbow colors
It makes it more enjoyable to interact with.
I use pillboxes as well
"Mostly because I split my pills (they're the kind that can be split), my prescription is for 2x20mg a day, but I find 4x10mg works better for me, spread throughout the day"
"It took a while to get in the routine, but it works great"
"Some days I only take 3 during work hours and don't bother in the evening if I don't need it.

So I have to sit down and split the weeks pills anyways, so I fill my container, and that container lives in my bag that goes everywhere with me.

Sometimes I still have to frantically split a couple pills in the morning before work because I forgot to refill it the night before, but overall, the habit has been built.

The hardest part for an ADHDer is to build that habit in the first place."
this is what i do as someone who takes multiple meds
"i have a little spinny pill organizer that’s shaped like an orange slice, and it’s set up so it runs out on thursday morning"
"i have therapy (telehealth phone calls) on thursday, so i always refill it during therapy."
I feel this so hard omfg
The auditory memory is a true thing and I’ve never met anyone else that has it like me lol I will remember how someone sounds when they said that exact statement but can’t remember what I ate for dinner last night
Weird stuff lol
I do this to remember that I have closed the garage or gate!
Great method!
“Logging it” absolutely helps
I had to start physically writing it down though.
This is low key genius
bro was in fact onto something
Ha this is so true
I am so bad at remembering to take my B12 and I get anemic if I don't
You just gave me reason to be more consistent
I did screw up accidentally a couple months ago and took Mydayis twice one morning
It turned out to be a good thing because we figured out I needed to up my dose
I'd been feeling like it wasn't doing anything anymore for a few months
One morning I was certain I had forgotten to take it because I was so tired and kept going to kitchen for food
So I took what I later figured out was a 2nd pill
When they both kicked in I felt normal for the first time in months
I wasn't falling asleep and got so much work done
Later though my friends were like what is wrong with you
You are talking so fast today 😣 We upped my dose which was less than the double dose I took that day and it worked perfectly
Improved my sleep too.
"This is so good! It is better to take Vitamin B in the morning too, assuming it doesn’t have any negative interactions with whatever meds you’re taking."
This is my system….absolutely drives my partner mental but is the most consistent way that I’ve ever been able to manage my meds.
"I found when doing that that if I did the vocalization in some weird way, it was much easier to remember it happening"
Like if I sang it out loud in an opera voice or held my nose and said it as nasally as possible
"Yes, silly, but the silliness is what made the memory stick."
This is an amazing product idea!!!
🤣🤣🤣 love this! Ima start saying it
"They make pill boxes with three spots for morning, afternoon and night too! It’s a life saver when you have to take multiple meds spaced out through out the day"
I need this omg
I try to say the day out loud too! “WEDNESDAY”
" Brilliant! Visual cues, ritual…."
I used to do the flip it when I've taken the pill too
"But I also kept forgetting to flip it back over before bed, so now I use a weekly pill box."
you can get a thing that has a switch for every day that you stick directly onto your pill bottle.
got the same one in pink so i can find it!  And a different style backup for when I can't!
I’m also a fan of the monthly pill box!
I got my kid a week long pill tray and she INSISTS on taking the days out at random and not using the actual days
"Like c'mon, you're just asking for trouble"
Why be like that?
Leave the lid up after you’ve taken that day’s pill
One of my cats *loves* pills
 He's especially attracted to Prozac for some reason
 I have to kick him out of the room when I refill my boxes every month
" Also, progesterone smells slightly of fish (horf) and he's really into that one too"
"He likes feet, too"
 He's a freak.
But which ones? They all look shady lol.
I searched for an image to link but couldn’t find one
"

The package has rows of pills, one row for each week labelled “Week 1, Week 2,” and on top, the days of the week - Sun, Mon….

This way I can see if I took it or not"
I leave them beside the sugar for my coffee because I make coffee at home every morning so I can’t forget it because I’m looking at it
I keep a few extra pills in my suitcase for when I travel and forget to pack some.
"Yeah I bought a 30 day pill box thing, so I only have to fill the boxes once a month, which is much more manageable than once a week."
I also find myself leaving important things by the front door
"Keys, wallet, & anything I may need to bring with me for the day"
Meds & a water bottle would be the next best alternative!
But also I love so much all the creative ways our adhd brains come up with to do the things that we need to do! I’ll come back to this thread if I ever need to use any of these tricks!!
"This is a sidebar sorry! Just fyi you don't want to rinse after brushing,get that good fluoride coat your teeth :) (source: am dentist)."
I do a similar test with my retainers
"I brush them the same time I brush my teeth, so if they're in the dirty cup instead of the clean one, I didn't brush my teeth yet."
"I have some from Amazon that come with a bottle and just dump the pills in there every refill.

I use them for my sleeping pills, too"
"Different color cap, of course."
"Sme happened to me, so I had to buy the timer cap bottle.

Works great, except I lose the original bottle and don't realize I need to request a new scrip until I'm way too low"
"

And the price had become ridiculous...finally bought a replacement one anyway, and it was worth it."
This is a hilarious example of life with ADHD
So relatable
I'm starting to wonder if any of our meds even work.
the timer cap I bought on amazon came with its own bottle
I just dump my Rx into it.
The ones I've ordered come with brown bottles.
"I use the app Pillo on Android and it's snoozeable! also has several other features I find helpful, the most important being that when you get the reminder and press the ""take now"" button, it gives you a countdown and another button to press once you've actually taken the medication."
I just set actual alarms on my phone to remind me to take my pills
I refuse to turn them off until I've actually taken the pills even if it means I'm snoozing it for an hour
Once it's off there's no way I'd remember.
The iPhone one can be silenced but also stays on your Lock Screen until you say you took it.
"I have a to do app called tick tick that has a snooze function (that you can set for any amount of time), it's the best thing for remembering washing and things like that - you just don't click ""complete"" until you've actually done the task!"
I agree..
Because then I forget and it's 4:30 or 5 by the time I remember...and it's too late for me.
I believe the newer samsung health app does allow a snooze
I'm new to the med so I'm trying the XR version so once per morning but I do have my other pills programmed and remember seeing a snooze on the notification.
"Right?  If reminders on my phone was all it took to solve this kind of problem, then it wouldn’t be that big of a problem."
"Other great features of Medisafe:

- Alerts me when I am down to only a certain number of pills left so I can contact my doctor for a refill
- If I snooze/ignore the alert for more than 2 hours, it texts my wife so she can call and yell at me to take them (be warned though, if you take several things at once, it sends a separate text for each missed med)
- Different and attention-grabbing alarms (Elsa singing ""Take Your Pills"" to the tune of ""Let It Snow"")
- It checks for drug interactions which is how I found out my multivitamin should not be taken with my Adderall"
i stopped my meds like 3 weeks ago and i've been deleting the notification every day instead of turning it off lmaoo
I use a monthly box to reduce refills
Could never deal with weekly
"If it works for you, it'sprobablyfine with yourmedication, so this is more of a general note: some medications and supplements react with air or moisture over time, so you should check that before leaving them out of their original packaging for weeks"
"Especially if your pill box isn't air tight, which none of my pill boxes ever were"
"Particularly with opaque capsules you will probably not be able to tell whether the medicine inside is still ""normal"" or has reacted."
"I saw some the other day that were shaped like oranges/lemons/limes, with segments"
"So cute! 

I almost bought one before remembering I only take one tablet a day, (and they also weren't labelled with weekdays), so it would just be a pointless thing taking up space in my bag."
I heard a radio commercial for a national brand and recognized it as a girl I met at a couple parties 20 years ago
" Actually reached out to confirm it and was right.

I have no idea where I put my wallet when I got home this afternoon though."
"Mine is ""The oven is OFF!"""
This makes me realize I may need a higher dose of my adhd meds
Good thing I see my psych dr again soon lol!
"If you have a smart watch of fitness watch, you could set the alarm on you watch to save his mental state ;)"
That's a good idea
Anything to make it stick
"Even better, thanks!"
"Same! I got the pink first, lost one of the days, ordered the black, then found the missing one so now I just alternate between the two bc the return window closed 💀"
lol they aren’t
[I’ve used the same bottle for 3 years.](https://a.co/d/3PkaxeJ) it still hasn’t ran out of battery.
I feel so validated
I’ve had a couple partners shame me for not rinsing
"I didn’t have a good reason other than laziness, but now I do"
I know I'm not supposed to but I just can't stand the way it feels if I don't 🥴
"See, I am well aware of this, but I can't stand not rinsing."
Came to say the same thing as a dental assistant
🫡
So what you do once done brushing ?
"Weird.

I went from cavities what seemed like every other year to none after I switched to fluoride free toothpaste and started rinsing more often.

Pro tip there for others who have issues remembering to brush & floss: stick to drinking water and every time you go to get a drink, rinse your mouth first."
"For the non-dental people, content warning: TMI.

Can you explain how you get the slime out though? If I don't rinse, I'll keep spitting endlessly because the slime just keeps coming"
"I'll literally be like a toddler, having it all over my chin and clothes"
"It's just one endless thread.

I mean this is r/ADHD after all, don't expect me to stay on topic."
I also bought the ones from Amazon and dump the pharmacy bottle in
The amazon ones are big enough that I put a cardboard divider in it and put both pills I take at the same time in the same bottle! It's been working great!
Not sure if you have this option where you live but my pharmacy has an app so I can login frequently to check to see when I need to refill/renew
Also I get notifications through the app that my prescriptions are ready for pickup and I also get my pharmacy to autorefill my adhd meds on the day they are available for refill so I just get a notification that they are ready.
"I use MyTherapy, I've been happy with it so far."
I also use Pillo! That app had been an absolute game changer for being able to remember to take my meds when I can't them immediately at the alarm
Definitely an app that was designed for those of us who are highly forgetful
"Thanks, I'll look it up!"
It be like that
hi five brother.
Perfect thanks for the link! You're the best.
"I'm same, it gives me the gack 😖"
Me too! When I was a kid I thought you were supposed to rinse
"I thought leaving any toothpaste on your teeth was bad, so I would brush my teeth, then rinse my brush and brush my teeth again but with just water, and then I would rinse my mouth with water several times"
"Crazy! Now, as an adult, I know you shouldn’t rinse, but I’m so used to the feeling of nothing left on my teeth that it’s VERY hard for me not to"
I have worked my way down to just one quick rinse.
Same
"same! i've never tried not rinsing, but even just thinking about it is grossing me out lol"
"the taste, the mouth feel.."
ick.
Came to say the same thing as a dental hygienists brother-in-law
lol
It’s the little things
Wait ypur not supposed to rinse after brushing?? Welp I've been doing it wrong for my whole life then!🤣
This
Especially since 99% of the time I’m drinking my morning coffee or energy drink immediately after and I can’t do the taste of mixing those with the minty taste so it’s just double the horrible in the morning.
Came to say the same thing as a dental hygienists once removed niece
you're not alone
same here
knew about this rule when after dental cleaning appointments but I've always assumed they used a specific type of floride toothpaste that was different than home toothpaste
so..
whoops
"I'm finding that charcoal based toothpastes are a little better for brushing before eating.

Most recently I've been trying Boka's Yuzu Mint that has charcoal and hydroxyapatite (works like fluoride with fewer downsides)"
" Not 100% a fan of the flavor on its own, but it's mild and has less of a weird combination effect when you eat afterwards."
I went to the dentist once.
"charcoal toothpaste is not good for your teeth!! it's abrasive, so it just damages the enamel layer over time"
I stayed at the Holiday Inn next door to a dentist
What were we talking about again?
"How was it?

And I just forgot I asked this question with my adhd"
"All toothpaste contains abrasives - that's kind of the point.

From a quantatitative standpoint, the Mohs hardness of charcoal (~2.5) is lower than enamel (~5-6), dentin (~3-4) and most other common dental abrasives (Crest uses Silica which is ~5)."

"Are you moving from America to Canada? If you can't afford your meds there tends to be programs to help people afford their meds if they don't have secondary coverage but drugs also cost a lot less in Canada, although vyvanse is pricey, without insurance it's only about 120/mo and if you got a job with a huge raise I can't see that being an issue."

you even skipped the “I” in your title lol
Hi from another word skipper
I sometimes skip the most important word in a sentence like if I’m trying to text my friend “I do not want to go tonight” I’ll accidentally leave out the NOT lmao
"I didn't have this problem when I was younger, but with age and post covid I've become pretty bad about it. "
Same
Entire words and letters in words
Especially if I'm thinking quickly and writing.
My sister had speech issues and was in therapy for it until 12
They talked to my mom about the ADHD issue of skipping words (she and I both have it)
It's not about inattentiveness
"It's that your brain is operating so fast, it just can't get it all out of your mouth"
"

That's also why we have a tendency to interrupt people and finish other people's sentences (or is that just me LOL)."
For sure
I always catch the missing word(s) after I send a work email.
Why use many words when few word do trick?
"why many word, few word do trick"
We do it a lot with books too
Which is why a lot of ADHD people are really good speed readers
We figure out what's on the page/our brain has read the page before our mind has actually processed the words

Update: he gave me a half-hearted apology
I feel like it’s just because he realized I’m upset and he doesn’t want me to be mad at him
He was trying to joke with me and I told him I’m not happy with him and that’s when he apologized
Now it’s “are we all good now”? He does this all the time
He apologizes to make me feel better and doesn’t change how he talks to me
Clearly he still thinks I’m too much
He was specifically saying sorry for upsetting me and not for what he said.
Accept that this is who you are and be unapologetic about it
"Back when I didn't know I had ADHD, I had no idea what I was doing wrong, and would feel bad about it"
But now it's just on others for being ignorant
Especially if it's someone who has known me for awhile.
"Oh God honey, please"
It's not you
"I have felt this way so many times in my life and people have told me the same thing, but happy energy is a beautiful thing and you should not let anyone make you feel like shit over it"
"If it's anyone you can stop seeing, do it"
"Life's too short to feel ""too much"""
Maybe others are just too little
Fuck that.
"I used to get this a lot when I was younger, and reading this literally makes me want to cry because I know exactly what you're feeling"
"

You are NEVER too much"
You are NOT too much
"**Do you understand me?** 

I'm so sorry that there are going to be a lot of soul-crushing moments like this for you"
"There are going to be people who try and crush you, to break you"
People you love and trust
People who are meant to remind you of how **precious** you are
This is not going to be the last
"

**Your job in life is to not let it crush you.** You are a beautiful, ray of sunshine in a darkened day"
You are never too much
"Just because someone doesn't see that or understand, doesn't mean they get to squash your joy"
And I know it doesn't help
I know my words probably won't make it feel any better
"But, I'm telling you from one ""too much"" to another, ***never*** let them steal your joy"
"

For me, I found people that understand I am not too much"
That makes it easier
"It makes the days when I'm around my family, who do not understand, better"
The pain is still hard to feel
"That has never gotten easier, and I wish I could say it has"
"You learn though, you realize that they're the wrong ones, and that does make it easier to witness *as* you feel"
And you don't feel it as long
"More importantly, you have people to feel it with you"
"

Remember, you are loved and cherised"
Find your people.
One persons’s “too much” is another person’s “not enough” and another person’s “that’s all you need?”
Damn why did I feel this in my very soul?
I don't think you're being too much
"We're human! It's normal to feel happiness in any levels! And I don't think having ADHD should push us to 'water' it down.

The best way to cope is to surround yourself with people who support and love you"
"Since you can't find it in your parents, find it in other people"
I promise you there are people who will appreciate you for who you are.
I know the feeling
My approach is twofold
"I remind myself that other people are not against me, my feeling of rejection is my mind making a mountain out of a molehill"
The sting of rejection is me making a big deal out of someone who is just not mentally in my space and that's OK
"
And Secondly, I let myself be 'too much' by being creative in a private physical space or mental space"
"I go jogging, crafting, reading, Journaling, dancing while doing the dishes to loud music in my ear pods"
These activities let me be loudly happy while not disturbing others.
"Your dad is a douche, I suggest telling him that."
"I have ADHD myself, but not hyperactivity"
I dated a girl who had the hyperactivity component
I used to get the feeling of her being too much when she was in a great mood too
"The reason is, the better her mood the more bold she became to the point she would be cracking jokes about people walking by us in the street and then be like IM KIDDING LOVE YOU GUYS when they were ready to fight"
"She would be throwing a football across the street over the traffic and when I would refuse to throw it back, or ask her not to talk shit to strangers, she would absolutely blow up and freak the fuck out to the point she would become violent to her friends.

What I took away was that her mood was an avalanche"
"It’s a very good thing to be happy, but it’s not a good thing when you are so happy that you lose perspective of society"
"Mood swings bipolar? Too much means you suck the oxegen out of the room, God has that quality too"
"Do you have to be handled now at your age, you don't say how old you are? Do you need to care about how other people see you?"
There's a response to this I heard from Elise Meyers
"If I'm too much, go find less"
Just..
go find less.
I was going to tell you to not worry about what people say or think be you.
Thank you
🩷 My dad does know I have ADHD and he’s put some effort into understanding it but it seems like he’ll always see me as annoying
When he says things like that it makes me want to change myself but after some thinking time I don’t think I should
I’ve always been excitable
Most people like it… my best friend loves me for it and I have to remember that.
"This is really comforting, I’m genuinely tearing up reading this"
I feel like this is what I always needed to hear from my parents but instead they’re always annoyed at me
Thank you.
"No this really really helps, I’m screenshotting this and saving it in my phone so I can read it whenever it gets tough"
Thank you
It’s really really good to know it can and does get better because sometimes it feels like everyone will have a bad reaction to me
"This helps, ty"
"Yeah, I think it’s a sentiment shared by a lot of us 🫠 it sucks"
"Thank you, this gives me some hope"
My parents seem annoyed at me all the time and it’s gotten to the point where I can’t imagine someone not being annoyed with me
(For context I am an adult but I still live with them because there is a housing shortage in my country so I see them every day.)
"It doesn’t feel like a molehill, though… it feels like a confirmation that I’m annoying and insufferable"
That I’m hard to be around
"

I do have time to listen to my music and run and all that, I wasn’t being hyperactive in this situation (at least I don’t think so) I was just happy 

(Sorry if this comment comes across as rude tone is really hard over text)"
And no offense but it seems like your ex girlfriend liked messing with people
That’s not inherently caused by hyperactive ADHD and that’s not what hyperactive adhd means or is for everyone
That’s not me.
I’m… not like this
"I wasn’t even talking to anyone if they didn’t talk to me, and I was very calm"
My dad’s problem seems to be that I was smiling when I was just sitting on the couch on my phone
I wasn’t saying anything when he told me this
I didn’t “lose perspective of society”
I don’t think hyperactive ADHD makes you an inherently bad and annoying person
"

And I was just commenting asking for advice on how to deal with my feelings coming from it"
My dad was mean to me and it hurt my feelings
That’s it
This just made me feel worse and like it’s somehow my fault that I got told I was “too much” for smiling.
I’m an adult
I don’t have bipolar
"And it’s my dad, of course I care when he’s being an asshole to me."
Also I was asking for tips on how to deal with my emotions resulting from the situation not to be told I have a different disorder and talked to about god
You or anyone else doesn’t know what my daily life is like.
"This is great, thank you"
"I love Elyse Meyers, her videos have helped me a lot with accepting my ADHD after my diagnosis"
Some of processing our impact on other people might be the reason why we mask
"Sometimes masking is spoken of as a negative but really, it's showing awareness and empathizing with someone else's comfort levels"
Unchecked overactivity might stimulate anxiety in people around us so we have to be as mindful of other people and we want them to be for us
"Also, ADHD has a strong generic component so your dad may have something going on that amplifies his anxiety but he still loves you enough to want you to be ok."
You're so welcome
"❤️❤️❤️

Like, it's understandable that some people get annoyed with us sometimes, but it honestly says everything about them"
And not even in a negative way: it's just them and their response to stimuli
Doesn't mean us being happy or hyper is wrong in any way
"I don't know you, but I feel you, and I'll say it again and again if you need to hear it"
Do you!!!
You aren't too much
Or maybe you will be for some people
Either way there's nothing you can do to change who you are fundamentally and there are far worse things in life you can be than just 'too much'
"I know the fear, I really do"
I seek reassurance all the time from my bf that I'm not too much
But the reality is also that we tend to have rejection sensitivity and we will feel the sting much more than intended
"You may be too much sometimes but you're also sweet, kind, forgiving, loving, smart..."
I’m sorry
I didn’t mean to imply you were the same
I was trying to add an additional perspective
My parents have treated me that way my whole life
"I have recently started to tell them that the reason my life is such a mess at 40 years old is because they and everyone else had spent my whole life convincing me that I am wrong or bad, and if they could please stop and start encouraging me instead it may help me build my confidence and become the successful person they obviously had hoped for"
"

That shuts them up usually"
I appreciate you so so much
This helps more than you probably know 💕💕
Maybe I should try and ask him to be supportive
Sounds like it can’t really make it worse

"I'm AuDHD.


Only found out I'm autistic in April.


It's kinda been weird, because now that I know this about myself, I notice the people I connect with are all ADHD/Autistic.


Truthfully, I don't mind either way"
"I'm weird, so I don't care."
"It sounds woo woo which is really outside my norm.

But I feel like people with Autism, ADHD, Bipolar tend to have this sort of.."
"sparkle in their eyes that triggers something In me haha.

I'm sure it's some sort of other subtlety that im picking up but curious if anyone else notices it?"
"At school, I always made friends with the weird kids that most people didn’t like"
Idk if they were on spectrum but something was up.
I have AuDHD and my husband has ADHD..
yeah I was drawn to him - lol
"He is a dynamite extrovert, but I love that he loves the things he can hyperfocus on"
He would literally have a PhD in history if he went to school for it; he's read books cover-to-cover that you can only buy through university libraries
"He's not a casual like ""oh yeah, I saw Hamilton, I like history"", he's like .."
*into* history at an insane level
Do *I* know anything about history? Nope
But I love that he loves it
"We share an interest in DnD and sci-fi/fantasy, and I have my own interests apart from his"
"So there's some overlap, but we appreciate and understand that we both have deep special interests that we express in different ways"
"It can be pretty perfect if it's the right person, and both people have at least gotten a little therapy or done some self-awareness work so they know how to talk about the issues with social intelligence, etc, like you brought up."
I have a hard time being friends with autistic people
It’s incompatibility mostly.
"most of my friends are either autistic, adhd, or both"
"most of them still have a decent amount of emotional intelligence though, as it is a spectrum and i guess i just get along better with that sort"
parter is also autistic
I suspect my husband is autistic or AuDHD and I think that’s why we work so well
"He’s quiet, introverted and so damn intelligent - I can ramble at him about my hyper focus, my job, my day, my general stream of consciousness and he listens and absorbs every minute of it and provides thought out feedback"
"He doesn’t ramble like that at me which is probably a good thing because I’d find it boring! I’m attracted to the calming influence he has on me and how he happily tags along on all my hair brain schemes and adventures, quietly making sure the car has petrol and the details are under control and he’s attracted to my passion for life and my energy and knows that me pushing him outside his comfort zone all the time makes him better for it."
"My wife is probably autistic (but high level one undetected)
Obviously kids are both autistic and adhd, fun times"
"I do relate to relationships falling apart, but I have a habit of blaming myself"
"It’s great that you recognize these situations as incompatibility, and not as something that you must have done wrong to sour them."
Yup
"My I'm 99% sure my best friend is autistic, and my spouse is also autistic (late diagnosed, only a year ago)"
Autistic people are fucking rad.
"Idk, I wouldn't say all autistic people like me"
My wife certainly adores me
There were a couple of autistic guys from my previous job that I was on good terms with
"Likely because once I knew what was up with them, I didn't expect the fish to fly, so to say, and didn't give them shit for discacludia or doing things too slow"
There was also an autistic chick in the same place that looked like she hated the guts of everyone around
She was one of the most organised and efficient people I ever met
Her people skills had a lot to be improved
"I don't think she liked me, or anyone else there at all"
"

About empathy though, idk about other people, but my wife is definitely a very empathetic person"
"Sometimes she's shit at expressing it in conventional ways, though"
"Like comforting me when I'm sad is apparently very hard because she feels like has to chose the right words, so she just hugs me quietly sometimes which I find annoying"
"And sometimes I have to announce that I'm not feeling that well, otherwise she wouldn't have a clue"
"But once she knows, I know she cares a lot"
That's just to say not all autistic people are the same and I think that stereotype about not feeling empathy is kinda wrong
"They feel it, they just aren't overly clued up on how to express it."
Always
Canny go a normal.
"I have 4 very close friends, 2 are on the spectrum."
I attract disordered people for lack of a better word
"*Tons* of narcissists, users, people struggling with mental health, unstable folks, folks having money problems, “Hey can I crash on your couch” people, folks who want to trauma dump or use me as a free therapist."
"Yes, and it's not all good"
"In addition to all the interesting and straight forward people, I also attract a certain subset of autistic and adhd people: those with no interests, no social skills, and not enough analytical skills to make up for it. 


They latch on to me like barnacles, and I try to be a good friend, but I simply don't have the social battery to hold their hand through everything"
"I used to be gentle in my rejection, but I am burnt out, and can't always do that"
"There's one now who thinks me a highly valued friend, but he keeps overstepping boundaries and doesn't take instruction, no matter how direct"
"I don't think of him as a friend, just an acquaintance, but because he's connected to a larger group, I can't just set fire to the bridge. "
Yes! But also it’s rude to point it out if they don’t already know
I know that now…
I definitely think this is true
Throughout life the autistic people others thought were weird or difficult to talk to I found very easy to talk to and understand
"Then again, people also can find me weird and socially awkward too"
I think we’re a bridge almost and able to communicate on similar wavelengths
"

There’s definitely a handful of adhd folks I didn’t vibe with that were a little more extroverted and loud"
"I could understand them and appreciate their quirks, but because I’m so introverted didn’t feel comfortable with them"
I’m hypersensitive too.
"I've been in a relationship with a borderline personality disorder, twice"
"In hindsight, I think most of my exes fit in that category"
"I think it's because they are so dominant (and manipulative) you don't have to think.

As an ADHD'er you might have an urge to please others"
I dunno.
Yes I relate
It's wild to feel introverted and extroverted at the same time to the point it's crippling
"

But some of my best friends are on the spectrum, ADHD or have PTSD or neglect problems"
"Most of them are nicer and more understanding than most people I've met who come from money or are non ADHD, autistic, etc."
I'm audhd and I love adhd people.
"I collect autistic friends like Pokemon cards, they're just neat."
"I think I rediscovered how much ""dynamites of extroversion"" tire me out and that I don't go well with other adhd people who are leaning more hyperactive"
"After getting my adhd diagnosed, a lot of my friends came out with various disorders though, so there's definitely at least a bit of truth that birds of the feather flock together."
I married my husband…With autism…So…Yeah
😬
"As I work with more people with ADHD and Autism, the more I am convinced they're manifestations of the same neurological phenomenon"
More and more people are being diagnosed with both
"My guess is that the medicine will lump it all into the same diagnosis soon, just like ADHD hyperactive/inattentive/combined was.  




To answer your question, yes"
"Literally all of my close friends are either ADHD, Autism or a combo of both"
We attract fringe thinkers
We have similar experiences of not really fitting in and not having good language to describe why
I also think there's a deeper commonality of operating in the world that makes us gravitate to each other
It's kind of awesome to feel like I fit with my friendship group after 40 ish years of being the weird kid. 
"I have adhd and whilst I enjoy interacting i cant hack longer than 2 hours with groups or within an environment (anxiety), Also sensitive to light and noise"
"

Do other adhers experience similar or does this sound more like autism?"
"If I recall correctly folks with ADHD and autism both rate much lower on communication/socializing issues when communicating with *each other.*

Less masking is necessary, you understand certain jumps of logic or patterns of thought easier, you can relate to each other's struggles and fixations, etc"
"There's less pressure to justify yourself.

It winds up being really common for ADHD and/or autistic kids to cluster together in school, for example, regardless of whether or not they're diagnosed."
I attracted to BPD people
"And they love me because I am saver, people pleaser or codependent type"
It is insane to realize that
"It feels they are seeing truth me and love so deeply, genuinely"
And I can give them so much back
"Don’t like pure NPDs though, they funny at first glance"
"I see them straight away, because their flat-out, low key abuse and inflated self ego"
Covert type ones could be trickier to identify
"

But mirroring and love-bombing of BPDs it is what I have been unconsciously seeking for years"
But it always ends so badly
"

Codependency it is death of soul and true self as sacrifice for better world(not worth it)

An also hypersensitive"
"I’ve found non-bpd, non-whatever are just boring and Juiceless"
"That is how far I’m addicted to BPDs.

I like autistic folks very much but not for close relationships though."
"Most of the friends I've made are autistic, have ADHD, or are a mix of the two! Heck, one friend I made when I was little was an autistic kid who was bullied by other students because of his name (he has an Arabic name)"
"I hated that, so I stood up for him"
"I think he ended up leaving the school or something, though"
"But he ended up being the only student at my birthday party, back in like 2nd grade"
"My elementary school ""best friend"" at the time straight up *lied*, and said that she and her mom were at the store, getting a present"
She never came
"But he, his mother, and his younger sister came, which made it so much more fun!

I'd say yes, though"
"They're also usually some flavor of the rainbow, lol"
Like attracts like
We are a like a wolf pack
Yep
The 2nd paragraph resonates with me.
I have ADHD and my fiance has autism (I think he also has ADHD) but long story short yes
"Lmao yeah, I'm glad I'm not the only one"
Yes
All my friends are autistic and I realized that recently
Dunno what exactly that says about me but it's become a bit of a meme among us
Hahaha
"Im not diagnosed (yet), but I work as a Kindergarten teacher and somehow almost always 'klick' with autistic Kids or  kids that also have adhd"
"Most of the time I just intuitively know what they need in that moment.
Problems arise when I am overstimulated myself and get impatient."
The idea that autistic people don't have empathy is a false one
It's a spectrum and it varies but scientists have proven it wrong
I'm autistic and I'm constantly trying to help animals and I always make an effort to be kind and helpful to others in my own way
"Growing up and getting the diagnosis as a teen was awful, imagine getting told that you are basically a robot or a psychopath.

I've started to suspect that I am Audhd, or it's just autism with C-ptsd"
But I tend to attract more outgoing ADHD people
"I like their liveliness and they like my calmness.

Anyways I think it's important to remember that if you meet some people with autism or adhd not to judge everyone else that has the same condition based on those encounters"
We are still individuals even though we can share some traits.
Yeah I can relate
I was in this relationship for 28 years
It turned into me amputating 75% of my personality in order to accommodate SO’s preferred patterns.
I mean I don't  want to diagnose anything but ..
yeah.
at least people that fit the criteria of being socially awkward and unaware and really hung up on some weird rules and morals and who are just really different  somehow
"

And I mean I like them but I can't  really relate to them that well"
They have way different priorities and personalities from me.
Lack of empathy isn’t necessarily an autistic trait! It’s just autistic people often express empathy differently
The ways you express empathy might seem weird and unhelpful to them too
You gotta chat about this and meet somewhere in the middle :)
I'm also good with animals and children.
I think we naturally gravitate to like minded easily sooooo yeah pretty much a yes for me 😂
My son is autistic and Ive noticed he tends to have adhd friends
"I'm autistic/ADHD, my wife is autistic/ADHD"
All my kids are of varying levels of autism and ADHD
"

My house is a lot of fun...."
When unmedicated yes.
"I have ADHD and my husband is on the spectrum 🤸🏻‍♀️ he loves my cuckoo crazy ass & I love his blunt honesty 
(even if it hurts my feelings sometimes)"
Yep
To find out a little under half my friends had autism was crazy
They have the same level of interest in their interests as I have in mine and I like that
People really do just sort themselves out without really being told
I think that's how the friend part started
almost all of my friends are adhd or autistic
"I don't know if i attract specifically people on the spectrum  ive worked with someone who had ''AuDHD'' and we got along great she was the only one who didn't get in any type of conflict with me she even joked about  me having ADHD '' and i was like yeah ''huehuehue sure i do'' well fast forward a few years  turns out i do XD

Reason we got along i think is i could se some of her traits in me and i knew what buttons not to push to make her feel overwhelmed by new information you had to approach her in  calm direct structural way 

she was funny as hell and outgoing but her ups and down were the same as mine only Autistic trait or whatever you wanna call it  she did not always understand if someone was making a joke on her expense or if they were bullshitting so she asked me alot  what is that person talking about etc or sometimes when a coworker was  trying to explain something i could se this is not gonna end well cause they had the wrong approach so i had to step in like ok this is how we do it"
( i dunno sounds weird like some white knight type of BS  but it was more that i could empathize with sensory/information overload)
I been thinking exactly this yesterday
"Something draws me, but if feelings get involved i get hurt easy because ASDers are not on their feet with empathy/or do not express it in an emotional way."
I am adhd and have only dated autistic men
I drive them all insane but my loyalty and understanding make it work.
Yes (or idk if all of them actually have autism but they have “autistic traits”)
"My partner is autistic, so… yes lol"
"He’s very drawn to my vivaciousness, whereas he is shy and awkward, I’m kind of… unhinged, heh"
We communicate well overall
His need for structure and routine helps keep me balanced
"

He’s always found it really attractive that I seem to have at least a base knowledge or skill in literally everything, and I find his quirks amusing"
"His special interests aren’t too out there - typical nerd stuff, sports, and he’s an amazing cook"
He also bakes his own bread
"Like seriously he’s been baking bread since he was like 20- what 20 your old man just bakes bread for himself every Sunday like it’s nbd? 

He also is so tidy whereas it can be a struggle for me"
"

We balance each other out pretty well"
"He’s so caring and supportive, and I really value that in a partner"
"We both need harmony, but for different reasons"
"I really love him, even his awkward movie quotes nobody else gets, lol"
"AuDHD here, got married then years afters years I started to notice some behavior which were not unknown to me.
I told her, by joking a little, I think you have autistic traits.

She said ""yeah you could be right, I have behaviors that resemble you""

Then, she got positive to the diagnosis 🤷"
Yes!!!!!
I’ve noticed I do have quite a few autistic friends but I think I know the trick
Play along
Not condescendingly of course
"

I think there hasn’t been a single time where one of my friends was talking about something obscure and I didn’t “yes and” the conversation"
Whether it’s why muddled basil is better than chopped for pesto
Or why some beetles are growing out of control because we aren’t doing controlled burns in Canadian forests.
diagnosed with ADHD at 5 1/2 and asd at 31
I’m the mama of an autistic 9yro so I can spot fellow autistic people whether kiddos or adults since I’m super aware of It
My husband is also on the spectrum
We at times drive each other bonkers with our own quirks but we also mesh well
One of my really close guy friends is autistic and I’m one of his safe people that he comes to for everything
Sometimes It can be overwhelming when he hyper fixates on whatever is bugging him at the moment until he can be talked through It.
"it is tiring 


they tend to make everything about themselves "
My father is AuDHD
"Unfortunately, we do not get along too well"
Once you know it about yourself you become an expert identifying it in others.
">I'm AuDHD


Stealing this"
Did you get tested separately? How did that work?
If that shit makes you sparkly then i must be a god damned fairy princess
"Imo, that sparkle is mania/hyperfocus/special interest"
"Different things, but they all can present very similarly"
Yes
I feel like a dog meeting another dog
It’s no sparkle
"Dress, speech, fidgeting, failing to relate to most others in the room, and other things can be quick clues"
Small things we pick up on very quickly
I’ve been to conferences where I end up finding other ADHDers and audhders pretty quickly.
"Well, they are all related disorders."
All three of my serious relationships were with autistic women
Two didn't really figure it til later in life
Also 2 out of 3 are nonbinary
"Unsure what any of this means, but i'm good with it"
I completely agree
I'm happy it is working out for you two
I incidentally also like history
Are you both medicated?
"Hey, my partner (autistic) is also deeply into history and TTRPGs! Like defending their history PhD dissertation in a few weeks and the best GM in the world, whose worldbuilding is heavily informed by their dissertation research"
Owns a whole library of TTRPG system books at this point
"We're both similarly outgoing and have done a lot of personal work.

>It can be pretty perfect if it's the right person, and both people have at least gotten a little therapy or done some self-awareness work so they know how to talk about the issues with social intelligence, etc, like you brought up.

This right here"
"In my former relationships with autistic people, I had a lot of the same points of friction as OP described, but if I took the issues I brought to the table in a vacuum, there was no healthy relationship I could have had"
"If you and your partner have both put in some self work, then the ADHD and autism can actually be very complementary."
Goals :)
I'm the same
Other autistic people I've met in my life tend to be loud and touchy feely and I'm the complete opposite and freak out.
Same.
I used to think that way too
This is a sign of depression and low self esteem.
You’re 100% right about the empathy
"Autistic people are empathetic and some are extremely so, they just lack the ability to express their empathy in conventional ways at times so they appear as if they don’t care- when in fact, they may actually care quite a bit, maybe even more than anyone else in the room"
Thinking Autistics lack empathy is a very problematic misconception.
"Haha, freaking same"
How did we end up like magnets.
"I have a similar experience, and I also have less tolerance as I’m getting older"
I cut two “barnacles” off two years ago
"One in particular seemed to always need fixing, saving and rescuing, despite receiving a significant inheritance (that she burned through)"
"I believe strongly that she’s disordered somehow -
BPD, a covert narcissist, bipolar, something"
I also suspect she’s on the spectrum as well
"We were close friends, but I don’t want that type of person in my life anymore."
To tell an autistic person that they are autistic?
I have an urge to interact with others and to have their undivided attention - definitely
But I only wanted to please others when I had a severe anxiety disorder and depression as a teenager
"Adult me is dismissive, sarcastic and cynical 🫣"
"> introverted and extroverted at the same time

I feel so seen…"
I think you might be one to do something with your first paragraph
"I have an acquaintance in his 40s, who gets prescribed small doses of stimulants for his depression"
He is also autistic
It helps him
I still do see clear and fundamental differences between his flavour of neurological phenomenon and mine
"

He is quiet, reserved and introverted and talks to me about Elden Ring"
"I like Souls games.

I am a chatter box that keeps pestering him to go out, visit galleries, attend theatre plays, drink in bars, dance in clubs, flirt, stand up for himself, have casual sex, have a more fulfilling life, just do all the things💥 Right now, right here.."
passionately
"It's just that one of those things is also video games.

I am fully self aware about my intensity and how it puts off people"
Especially the quiet types but I literally cannot
Stop
Myself
"If anything, it was far worse without meds."
I dislike groups when I'm not doing anything sorta actiony where I can focus
"Things like concerts, gaming, or sports are fun"
But staying locked in a group just talking gets boring fast
My brain feels like the connections or patterns are dwindling down so there's nothing to make sense of
Bright overhead lights bother me as well.
bro literally what
"I'm sorry to hear that.


My Mother is AuDHD, and as of this year, I am no longer speaking to her."
That's so true! I find that I can identify it within a couple of minutes of meeting someone
"I went back to school this fall, and I knew right away that 2 of my teachers were adhd, and I was right! Same with 2 of my classmates, lol! I also noticed that because I've got 2 autistic kids and thus have been around it for 12 years, I can easily identify autistic people, too!"
"You can have it.


It makes human interactions awkward and uncomfortable too often, makes day jobs difficult to work in, causes problems with understanding others and self-esteem, makes you miss sarcasm, gives you weird food habits, allows you to be expressive creatively without having any inclination for self-promotion, and gives you the ability to become a couch potato."
No
"My Mother has diagnosed ADHD, but not Autism.


We're not speaking because of things like this"
"She disagrees with my diagnosis, but she's also disagreed with who I am in general.


Not much more to speak with her about unfortunately."
Relatable
Laughed way too hard at this
Passion manifest.
"Thanks, we both are, but only very recently"
"We've been together 15 years, and only started meds.."
last week
lol
"Sweet! That's so cool! My husband loves to DM, and he would *love* to build a 5E system based on some of the history he has read, with a kind of heavy emphasis on mercantile and politics -- I want to say Byzantine era, but he's read so much"
"He also wants to write a middle-grade novel on the Second Punic War, but he's working on a sci-fi book at the moment so that's on the backburner"
"We've mostly played DnD but I feel like he knows about other game systems, way more than I do anyway! He loves to play with people who worldbuild and don't mind going off-module"
He's a homebrewer for sure
His best group ran for years in a world that he built and DM'd
"I want to say it was more steampunk-based with airships and stuff (like Treasure Planet), but then there were also aliens and an alternate dimension"
Good stuff
:)
It's the opposite for me
Most of the autistic people I know tend to be very sensitive to loud noises and bright lights and like very clear cut answers
"Me? Can't get enough stimulus, ever"
"Clear cut answers? Hell if I know, I'm flying by the seat of my pants."
Agreed - swimming in both waters 🙃
I used to be like this
I realized for me it was because I made friends mainly w ppl who sought ME out
I didn’t make an effort to SEEK people out
It’s like vampires sense your energy/light/empathy/ lack of boundaries/willingness to be friends
And they choose you
Once i started seeking out kind people instead of just going w the flow of who was seeking ME out I have a much more stable and happy assortment of people around me
And I also put up some boundaries w the vampires
With boundaries & focusing on friends that i chose (instead of chose me) it’s gotten somewhat better.
Yeah they took it as an insult
It’s not at all what it meant
I thought it would be helpful because they act almost identical to me but I don’t think they understand what it actually means because they were way older than I was
I just keep things to myself now.
Same
"Dismissive, sarcastic and indeed even cynical"
"But to my friends, I don't have/need many, I'm caring and loving"
"I'll do everything to help them.

Being dismissive and sarcastic is actually part of my job as a freelancer"
People in my branche know my for my bluntness and passion for what I believe in
Being dismissive and harsh means that you actually care
Deeply.
[removed]
I would really like to avoid this scenario 🥺
"If you've got 2 autistic children then chances are....

Lol

Speaking from experience, I got 3 autistic kids"
They get it from their mom and dad.
"I already have it, just hadn't heard that term before


>allows you to be expressive creatively without having any inclination for self-promotion, and gives you the ability to become a couch potato 


Hi its me"
I meant: how did you find out that you are also autistic?
Username checks out
Precisely.
The only person I have told that is my father
"Unfortunately, he feels somehow threatened and immediately shuts down the conversation"
I feel I am entitled to it because sometimes it is very difficult to handle him
I wouldn't tell anyone outside of family that I suspect their being on the spectrum though.
"Well, I always care"
Also at risk of PTSD and currently actually having it 🫠🫠🫠
…are you calling people “it” now??? fr????? This is a wicked generalization and incredibly unkind.

"Seems like you have a pretty bad view of women, maybe work on that first…"
Maybe you didn't think about it very deeply in the past and just went with the flow
Also I think your observation is partially correct
"Society has changed quite a lot recently and that is true for men and women.
Women want to be independent from men nowadays and that is good.
What's bad is though is that many men cannot adapt very easily to this change which leads to frustration.
This frustration turns into anger and eventually into hate.
How can a man love a woman if he hates women?
Women feel this hate against them every day and as a natural consequence many of them react with hate as well.
But there is a solution to this:
Emotional maturity."

sounds like you probably have ADHD.
Are you unable to start the problem to begin with? Like you just kinda lay there or sit there in a ‘waiting’ mode paralyzed by like I have to do this but it’s a lot I can’t get up and do it kinda thing?
I know how you feel
I have the same problem but it’s better now after working on it a while
What helped me was breaking tasks down into more manageable chunks and also streamlining it in a way that works for me rather than doing it the way it works for other people
"

I also pace around a table in a circle sometimes"
It helps me think and get rid of nervous energy
Like you I also do this less now (I did it so much as a child it would make my dad dizzy lol).
I guess so..
it's just hard dealing with it at first and its 20+ years of effects and 5+ of it being a complete shitshow
"It's a combination of what you described as in setting up ten 2 minute timers when in bed and then once I get up to start, my name is written and maybe a put down a few words but then Im off doing something else on my laptop or sometimes just walking around aimlessly"
The walking thing happened more often before meds but idk.
"Thing is the reason I have so much self-doubt about this diagnosis is that  no one said anything about my pacing until a few years ago, and I was a solid B student all my life until the middle of junior year and it all went into a downward spiral then"
The only thing I can think of as a kid is one of my teachers bringing up daydreaming in grade 5 during a parent teacher meeting and looking at the clock when clsss would end and it would've only been 15 minutes...but I did participate in science and COULD focus
I will try the tips you recommended thank you
Late diagnosis is a weird grieving process
 Anger shame remorse etc.
That’s normal
A lot of people with ADHD are more intelligent than average and will brute force their way through life until they reach a point where they need to work on stuff and not just rely on natural talent.
Fair enough
but Is it possible that I was able to work on stuff...sort of
"Like I explicitly remember studying at various times, I just cant recall  how much I was actually getting done"
"Sciences was easy as in up until freshman year id just skim through stuff for an hour and ace stuff, and then I would be able to do practice problems in sophomore year because they're not filling me with dread"
and  when someone was with me I could work on math problems and up until junior year of high school sometimes on my own even but not since then
sorry If I'm ranting just wanted to pump out thoughts.
I got honors  all throughout highschool and definitely have ADHD and probably autism
 I guess I was just interested in school.

Not sure where you live but I would research beforehand to ensure they treat ADHD

being looked at as drug seeking for needing medication to be able to function as everyone else!

I hear you so hard
I didn't even get diagnosed til I was almost 30
"I'm smart as fuck, but I can't focus on boring shit"
"I can emulate a human for my work day, but it crushes my energy and soul"
"socially interacting with a group of humans will destroy my energy. 




Troubleshooting distributed data pipelines and cloud computing architecture? Easy and gratifying by comparison.





Filling out my timesheet on time is like asking me to paint 100 grains of rice individually with this one stubby beard hair. 






I've been a sysadmin or better for 15+years now"
"Imposter syndrome barely kept at bay because I am clearly the most advanced person in my field at my work. 




Don't worry though I got this secret advice my mom gave me over and over while I was growing up to let me know I am not good enough.


> You are so smart mriswithe, if you would just apply yourself.




SURE WOULD LIKE TO MOM, TOO BAD YOU IGNORED MY AUNT, THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL, WHEN SHE TOLD YOU I WAS ADHD AT LIKE 6 BECAUSE SHE HAS EYES AND A BRAIN."
"My friend, I am right there with you as someone recently diagnosed with ADHD-I as an adult"
" Taking medication has shown me how it is possible, though"
" For me, it is because I have learned to mask by constantly overthinking everything I do, and everything I say"
" I force myself to do my chores through my anxiety, and through ruminating on how miserable my life will be if I don't complete them.

I can talk to people when I take my Adderall"
" I find myself just saying ""hi"" to strangers on the street and smiling at them without even thinking about it"
" When it wears off I'm back to worrying about how they're going to react, worrying that they'll snap at me, or tell me I'm too chatty"
" By the time they are close enough to me to actually say anything to, I have run myself through so many negative scenarios that I am too exhausted to say anything"
" I'm doing the dishes now because it's easy, not because if I don't do the dishes the sink would be full, then when I have to cook for my family I won't be able to put the dirty dishes there, and I'll have to wash them all before I use them, and that'd stress me out.

I can get the chores that are the most obvious to others done without medication, but it takes up all of my time and energy to manage it, and when shit hits the fan it takes me weeks to recover."
"As you are very aware, ADHD is not a single trait"
Everyone is going to experience and express it differently
It sucks that other people around you aren’t getting it and forcing you to either put up with their ignorance or burden you with educating them
It’s maddening! It’s like the comment of having “mild autism.” It sure as shit doesn’t *feel* mild no matter what it looks like on the outside
"

Even my therapist does this and it drives me crazy"
They are clearly ADHD themselves and will constantly reference stuff like “if you’re have a hey squirrel! moment…” but I don’t relate to the examples being given
And I just smile and nod to try to move on instead of pushing back.
I hear this
"Personally don't relate to the chores aspect, but I was a high achieving student throughout hs"
It makes me feel like my struggles are fake because if I could do that well what's the big deal now? Our brains latch onto the smallest reasons to reject the idea of oh this is a legitimate struggle and I might be disabled and not lazy
It's hard to navigate
Are you me?
100% relate to the OP
My parents and spouse didn’t think I had ADHD because I was “too successful” and outwardly appeared functional
"Meanwhile I really struggled socially in school because I was the “weird” kid, almost failed science and math multiple times, and ended up in a career as a paramedic at times I feel to their chagrin because it was a much better fit for me, even though I managed to get my bachelors"
I am now a PA but school was super hard for me
I was elated when I got diagnosed because I finally understood myself better and could at least find ways to work on it for myself even when others didn’t want to acknowledge it.
"I am in the same invalidation boat with you, and it only worsens overall emotional disregulation."
Check out Cognitive Distortions
The first time I read them it was like someone had copied them down from my internal dialog.
I did great in school growing up
Always a good intuitive test taker
In the gifted programs with all kids who had the best grades
"(Mine were good but not literally like 105% average like the others.)

Depressed and anxious* since…being a toddler? I grappled with emotions I couldn’t vaguely control. 

I did okay socially"
I had friends
"But also found a lot of people inexplicably REALLY didn’t like me and never could figure out why. 

Diagnosed and medicated at thirty suddenly a lot of what I went through and my pervasive lack execution of basic life skills/social awareness/maturity despite a good understanding of all of those concepts made sense"
I always managed to keep a job and pay my bills and so never realized how stunted I was
"Even still I’m always playing catch-up. 

Only you live in your brain and know yourself"
Get comfy there and life gets infinitely easier
"Comparison is the thief of joy and ADHD looks vastly different from person to person. 

I get my chores done and am 100% the list maker, organizer and deep cleaner in my house"
However my diagnoses is very real!
ADHD is a circle
"Oh man, half the traits I have I either didn't know I had, or ,only began to have since I got diagnosed!"
There is no way I could listen to someone else's long monologue about their special interest!
i send you a hug
"People who think adhd means you are quirky and tweakerish, and that's it are dumb or sorry to be mean probably doesn't have diagnosed adhd"
I feel like I could have written this.
Dude I felt this with my soul
"I’m going through an ADHD eval now as an adult, and all the eval questions and hoops to jump through are so insulting"
"Like, just because I got good grades when I was 10 means I can’t have ADHD?? I literally had to have my parents write a letter that I have the same symptoms I do now as a child"
It’s all set up on the stereotype that people with ADHD can’t be intelligent
The kicker is that I’m happy I never got diagnosed as a kid
I would have never been given the same educational opportunities.
The fact that I can get things done was actually the thing that stopped me from getting diagnosed for now
I literally had this thought that I can’t have ADHD because I can finish things and I am making this whole ADHD thing up.
What’s imposter syndrome
I have adhd and have heard this term but know fuck all what it means
Also your friends need a good sit down and an educational adhd PowerPoint
"I have an organised room even though I have adhd, doesn’t mean I don’t have it."
"I get my chores done, exercise daily, hold down a successful very adult job, parent two kids, manage the household and still have rampant ADHD"
"And the imposter syndrome is real because of it! But the mental chatter, the anxiety, the constant need for deadlines, the burnout, interrupting people, being impatient… all real"
"ADHD isn’t just being a hot mess or quirky (although I am that quirky chatty person), it’s about executive function and working memory and chances are if you’re an intelligent person you’ve found systems to enable yourself to function like an adult to some extent but god damn it’s harder than it should be."
"At this point maybe just not tell people, or tell those “well, i went to a psychiatrist and turns out i just have anxiety”"
Idk
"Make something up to make them stop this.

I got diagnosed and even the psychiatrist made a remark because my adhd is not severe"
"Hell, even my therapist who I thought was cool.

They just do not understand"
"Just because my adhd is not severe doesn’t mean I don’t struggle a lot! They judge based on the stereotypes, rather than the actual real life implications on daily basis"
"Which they wouldn’t know because they haven’t lived it.

They don’t understand that i have 15,000+ hours gaming not because I want to but because I physically need to.

Now that I am medicated, i do not game"
I always knew deeply that i do not enjoy them
"Games are boring waste of life, and everything is repetitive."
Thank you for your reply! Made me actually feel better
Omg the timesheet
"I’m a product manager and can happily do very technical work, deal with management, stakeholders, customers all day long but asking me to jot that all down into blocks of time? I’d rather staple post its to my face"
The biggest change when I started meds was my timesheet being done accurately each hour without it being a weekly drama of self loathing and fabrication.
I feel this
We are required to complete trainings in a LMS by x date
"First of all, sit and read a 40 page document about something that has nothing to do with what I do? Ughhhh"
second of all yes I am late in completing these every month no matter how many reminders the system sends me
"Now that I have a diagnosis, it makes a lot more sense why."
how did you become sysadmin? qualifications needed? im doing a ccna course but getting discouraged having to memorize so many commands and acronyms with the emergence of LLM
and i dont event know if this qualification is of any use lol seems like its a waste of time.
Omg the timesheet part!! YESSS!!! 😭
Thank you! In feel the both of use are structured very similar! Makes me feel less alone for a moment :)
This is the most relatable thing I have read in weeks
"Being recently diagnosed and starting medications, the biggest relief to me (after learning that they are not a magic bullet) is that I can sit down and choose to do something I know I enjoy"
Not being at the mercy of my brain to decide what we are doing right this second is such a quality of life improvement
I am passionate about things and it’s nice to enjoy them without the raw and awful obsession of hyper fixation.
YES! Thank you so much :D
"I've just been diagnosed at 40 as Inattentive type, going down that path after one of my son's teachers got us to go through the process with him"
"And reading into it and discussing with doctors and colleagues who also have it, I was able to look back at my life with a new perspective and it clicked

Like, I did very well at school - but the further through the system I got, the more difficult it became because as you get older they pull elements of structure away, and you become more responsible for your own learning"
"Then when I got to uni, I did well at the subjects I was interested in, and struggled with any others"
"

But I forged on because I'm pretty switched on, and can improvise and adapt within the workplace and talk a good game"
"I'd get the visible shit done, the stuff others had a stake in.."
"but the rest would die in the vine because I couldn't focus, or I couldn't shift gears from one task to another"
I was able to apply routine and consistency to mask and manage..
then I had kids
"

Kids don't give a shit about your ringtone or coping mechanisms, and essentially tripped the breaker in my mind constantly and so it began to affect me more and more...

Honestly, getting medicated has helped me at work, and the general flow-on effects for my general mental health and home life have been appreciated."
I don't know
Am I? Are you me? We need to find out!
Imposter syndrome is where someone with good or great skills will incorrectly view themselves as bad or poor in the thing
"Excellent, your post resonates with me as well"
One data point (the one thing you don't fit for ADHD) does not make a line
"The rest of the data suggests you are ADHD, so it is a fair conclusion you are."
"Thanks! Also - and most importantly, as it is a clinical classification - I am diagnosed"
"People who aren't diagnosed never question their diagnosis in my experience, but clarity is always appreciated"

I have this problem to an extent! I love a good checklist and a plan
"For me it came from realizing a weakness of ADHD is that we lose track of where we are, do things in kind of a random order, etc"
"So I thought, hey if I can just sit down and plan this out I can come up with an efficient way of doing things!

The problem of course like you said, you spend way too long on the planning"
"I'm sure hyperfocus and not being able to switch tasks easily is part of it.

I don't quite have a solution yet, but one thing that has helped me is sometimes for things that don't matter, just leaning in and doing things as they come to me"
I've only managed to do it with cleaning though
"So I can know it would technically be more efficient to plan to clean this room, then that room, then do this task, etc"
"But if that stresses me out, I just go cleaning randomly and it still ends up better than if I didn't clean at all and just planned it."
"It's easy to get lost in the process, you aren't alone - we love to do that.

Identifying/creating automation tools helped me the most - I spent like 3 days building out a huge Excel spreadsheet for my finances; trend lines, chart generation, rough extrapolation 8 months out, whole 9.

I enjoyed those 3 days - my finances then became boring because I just update a single column each Sunday and it auto-adjusts for me"
"

Try to make it boring!"
Oh yes! Do I want to do a thing? Is it possible to over-engineer how to do it? Then I probably will do that! Sometimes recognizing this is a good step
If I realize I’m getting too in the weeds and too complicated I try to pull back and really ask what’s the bare minimum needed
"Other times I just lean into it.

If you want to cut back on giving yourself homework and can ask yourself what are you really trying to get out of a process, that’s a good start"
Like the budget
I still classify all my transactions into categories so I can see a breakdown of spending
"But I rarely look back at this data, so is it that necessary? Or I used to do a lot more life tracking of activities and mood, etc to find patterns"
I spent so much time trying to organize this stuff but in the end I never used it for anything
So it’s not a great use of my time to do it anymore.

"Is he on medication?


And saying that he HAS to text once a day sounds childish and selfish"
"If you need to hear from him then pick up the phone and call him.
Keeping in touch is a thing many people with ADHD struggle with"
"He is most likely not doing it on purpose.



Do you know the specific tasks he struggles with? Help him with that"
My GF struggles with cooking and eating
Luckily for me I love to cook and cook for her basically every day
I have to cook anyway and I know it helps her stress levels AND makes sure she eats something
"Food is also something ADHD people struggle with.


If you want to stay with this man I would recommend you to read up on the many different ways people with ADHD struggle to fit in normal society.


Be his safe person"
"Try not to judge him, be curious instead."
"As a person with ADHD who is currently dealing with an extremely stressful situation (I have moved to a city I can’t stand, while my spouse is 3000 miles away, to care for my daughter following a life-threatening illness), the best things to help me were to listen to— let me talk it out, as I process my thoughts and feelings that way — and then reassure me I’m loved, and supported, and this too shall pass"
"Also, talking with my therapist, using prn anxiety meds, talking to friends, getting outside every day, taking time to do things that are positive/a reprieve from the stress (a pedicure, a massage, a nice meal out) and cutting out any additional stressors that I can (no news, not talking to a parent)"
That my spouse says he loves me even when I cry and apologize and I feel all over the place means the world
Good luck!
"For me, it helps to feel I’m accepted and safe when I’m with my partner"
Verbal expressions of this doesn’t work though
But small things like a cup of tea do wonders
I tend to see the empty space in words but a gesture isn’t prone to that
If I’m being told that ‘I can take my time’ it is of course relief
But to me it also comes with “I’m being tolerated because I’m messing up here.”.
I try extremely hard not to judge him
I realize I am selfish asking for a text once a day - but I do experience a lot of anxiety over relationships
"(Past experiences, etc.) Please note that he doesn’t have to text me each day, it was a request, and he agreed to try his best"
"This is the first time it has happened since that was discussed, and I suppose it triggered me"
"I know he’s not doing it on purpose, and I try to phrase as such that I know he’s trying"
"I’m adapting to being in a relationship with someone that has ADHD, I’m not perfect"
"I’ll fudge up too and not realize I’m being unfair, and I always do my best to reassure that it’s not malicious"
I may just not understand right away.
I made sure to send him a very heartfelt apology after reading this
"Calling doesn’t work for him, texting isn’t MUCH better but I know he’ll see it eventually"
I’ve made sure to reassure him that I care - a lot
Thanks for your experience.
"Unfortunately, we don’t live together"
It’s a bit harder for me to make small gestures like that on a daily basis
I am supposed to be going to his house tomorrow though - I have arranged to get him a strawberry shortcake
His favourite
I’m hoping that it helps boost his mood.
"You skipped my question about medication by the way.


It's going to be hard for both of you"
"Honesty, respect and communication are the keywords here and you seem to get that."
Tbh the amount of communication depends on the person
I too like to have communication once a day
Most of the time my gf initiates this
But when I haven’t heard from her all day I like to wish her good night at least.
"Oh I see… Lovely gesture btw! 

You know, if I could pick one thing that I think is universally correct it would be the importance of separating the person and the ADHD they have"
It can be hard even for an ADHDer to fully grasp this
It doesn’t make ADHD misbehavior OK but it can help you with resilience
"

I’d encourage conversation for relationship health but your partner is likely not receptive right now"
Reflection once he’s over his frustrations can be very helpful and can help you create measures for future
Proactive approaches like this to ADHD-proof my relationship was very effective
"

You can be needy btw"
A fair expectation that is expressed and accepted shouldn’t cause guilt.
"Oops, sorry"
He is not medicated
"When he told me about it, he said that the medication caused heart issues."
There are different drugs
Many people here have switched medication more than once
It'll take time to find the right drug and dosage but he shouldn't give up after just one attempt/drug.

I’m going through the same thing with a lifelong friend
I’ve always been terrible about being the first to reach out and I’ve also ignored calls when I didnt feel like talking
I have depression also so it makes it that much harder to communicate sometimes
"To be honest though, her life has been pretty rough throughout the years and a lot of the things she goes through I see as her sabotaging herself so it makes it seem like a straight energy vacuum when I’m silently dealing with (not wallowing in) my own struggles.

Right now I think she has chosen to not reach out first as a test to my devotion and the adhd part of my brain makes me act in opposition to that"
It’s not an excuse and I should be better
"

You could try sending the TikTok’s or videos that help explain how the adhd persons mind works when it comes to communicating"
And let them know how much you value the friendship
Hopefully if they grasp a better understanding then the attitude will change
"

Not everyone will understand fully and some will never understand, unfortunately."

I really just dont know what to do anymore so I’d like to seek advice

Have you been diagnosed?

Believe me I relate to a lot of things you said, and I am right now undergoing diagnosis which unfortunately for some reasons are taking some time, but I am determined to not abandon because according to a lot, if you have ADHD, medication is life changing 

You are not dumb, and I relate to you in the specific matter of forgetting literally 5 seconds after something has been explained to me.."

Have you considered that adderall maybe isn't the right fit for you? Or maybe an extended release would be better? You should discuss this with your psychiatrist.
The geranic Adderall since last spring has not been right! I have discussed this with 100's of people who feel the same in a ADHD Facebook group I am in for women
We are convinced they are putting more filler in and less active ingredients
"Depending on the manufacturer I get for my XR Adderall it's tolerable and others I refuse to take due to it not helping my ADHD and instead raising my heart rate, anxiety and awful headaches (Elite/Burel manufacturer)."
Your brain and body chemistry changes over time
"A similar though different example, my asthma medication used to either work or didn't and it would make things worse because I was taking it non-stop"
"After some time of just switching my medication, I was able to go back to the OG asthma medication, no issues.

It doesn't sound like it's helping you though? Maybe talk to your doctor about switching meds."
how would you abuse it? that makes no sense unless you wanted to amplify all the crappy side effects of it (lookin at you teeth clenching)
I wonder sometimes whether switching up a different formula can get around your system getting “used to” or developing a “tolerance” to the medication
I experienced what you describe here almost exactly and switched to focalin long release after being on short release adderall
Check with your doctor and do research but I do like the change thus far personally
Stop trying to fix it for yourself
Speak with a professional.
Same bottle or they switching generics on you?
I felt the same way with methylphenidate
"I shared alot of the same symptoms as you, and i thought i needed a dose increase since i could still focus better"
But I would definitely talk about switching to another med! It's like yeah this is better than baseline adhd but I believe there is another option that will work with you alot better!
This also happened to me about 2 years ago
"The first few weeks were amazing, i honestly even felt like i was feeling too good? almost high? I was going to be at like 9pm every night and cleaning every corner of my room.That wore off and i fell back into old habits"
Would take the med and still rot in bed all day even upping my dose
I still am not sure why
I’m on Methylphenidate IR now and it’s been a little better but still having pretty bad executive functioning issues
Just know i am in the same boat and i feel you :\ it’s very frustrating
Make an appointment with your psychiatrist
there are several other ADHD medications that might work better for you without these side effects.
"Starting to, I’ve tried XR and it was kinda the same, gonna take a tolerance break for a while and see if that sorts it out"
I stopped taking it altogether
I completely agree with you about it not being right
It went from weak to just nothing at all
"I think they lowered the active ingredient, but kept it within the allowed amount"
"I really wish someone could test it, specifically the Sandoz"
"

I think for the foreseeable future, I’m done with it"
My wife says my personality has come back after being off it.
Read this and realized I was clenching my teeth
Thanks
Was taking way too much before
"Will do, thanks"
"It’s really strange to me, it used to just hit and be very predictable, knew what to expect and when I was coming down"
Now some days it scares me and others I can fall right asleep
"Same bottle, every day is a dice roll"
"Eating before seems to help, I’ve been running every day to keep my heart rate lower while taking it which helps"
"Okay, but I still recommend setting up an appointment with your psychiatrist"
"The goal here is consistency; If adderall isn't consistently benefiting you, then it's worth trying something else"
"But none of us here are your doctor or have any idea about your health and brain, so I don't think you'll get a definitive answer from anyone here because your brain is different from mine."
"Yes, I would love to go off of it"
"Unfortunately with the job I have, I need it otherwise I don't think I would have this job .."
😔
I may look at other options such a Vyvanse.
Right?!?!?! I need a mouth gaurd in the day
Why?
How much is way too much? Like 80mg a day?
Agreed I’ll bring it up my next visit for sure
I just chew gum dude
"Helps a lot, I did bite my tongue yesterday though, so chew smartly"
Oh no! That hurts big time! I think this is a solid choice.

"Honestly, one thing that really helps me is to be deliberate about reading"
Scrolling through reddit for 3 hours is easy because it scratches our brains in the worst and most addictive way possible
You default to going on your phone because your brain’s used to it being the easy mindless option (don’t be ashamed of it!! I think we’re all in the same boat)
"So, when I read, I make the effort to put my phone somewhere else, and to notice when I have the urge to go on my phone and nip it in the bud"
"Something else that helped me was to deliberately not use my phone in more aspects of my life (when cooking, cleaning, watching youtube, you name it) so that I get used to immersing myself in the task at hand"
"And listen, its hard, but not impossible"
"Today is my 40th consecutive day of reading :3 be patient with yourself, and remember that reading should be enjoyable"
If a book is bad you’re allowed to not finish too.
I'm a book person who has gone through similar periods of burn out when studying literature for school or professional development at work burn me out
"

So my tips

1) Pick easy reads"
Read junk fiction you enjoy even if you would be embarrassed to admit to anyone else you ever read it
"I love short form when I'm struggling to get back, but there are lots of short forms that combine and might give you the best of both worlds (think *Green Mile* style).

1.5) Or reread something you really loved again just to get you flexing those reading muscles again"
"The familiarity makes the reading ""easier"" accomplishing the same as above.

2) Keep books everywhere so you can just grab one when you are reaching for your phone again"
Read in those down minutes you would normally use your phone but make it really easy to do so
"It is ok to read multiple books at once, your brain might even like the novelty as it starts to duplicate the way social media gives us tidbits of varying information.

2.5) Don't be afraid to not finish a book, it's not a commitment

3) Start reading on your phone"
I check out ebooks from local library and read through the Kindle app on my phone
Constant selection and variety
Also helps replace the opening an app habit because now I'm reading a book instead of browsing social media again
"

3.5) Turn off notifications to social media apps to help reduce the urge to switch over to them or open them

4) Be intentional in reading"
Make yourself a sticker chart
Buy yourself a pan pizza after you read so many books
Only eat the really good snacks when you are reading
Have a friend start a book club with you so you have some accountability
"Just don't want to read - find ways to force yourself doing whatever tricks work for you.

Some people have gotten through the reading burnout with audio books, some even read along with the audio book, so I mention it but if you like physical reading like me I know that doesn't help much"
"

Last but not least - anything worth doing is worth doing poorly so embrace the time you do spend reading as a win."
 A book that was not hard to read and also quite interesting to me
I'm a fan of the band Rush and Geddy Lee wrote a biography recently
"It was actually my wife who said ""hey, I thought you might like this"" and brought it home from the public library"
"It engaged me immediately, his writing style is natural and not challenging, and this morning I arrived at page 300! This is the closest I've come to finishing a book in years"
My next read will be another engaging subject that's not terribly difficult to read
I'm hopeful this will re-flex my reading muscles enough to keep on going and eventually take on more challenging books.
I'm lucky enough to have a friend group that started a bookclub
"I was already starting to read again but having something I was held accountable to definitely helped.

I am very niche in what I read on my own time, mainly early 20th century pulp fiction, gothic literature, trashy 80s horror paperbacks, and the classics"
All things I already have deep interest in
Having a choice between a dense classical work I can really engage with on a deep level and dumb fun genre novels keeps things varied
"The bookclub is what helps me discover new things, for example I found I really enjoy contemporary Japanese literary fiction like the works of Haruki Murakami and Sayaka Murata.

So what worked for me is a balance of accountability, having a reading comfort zone I can always fall back into, and the excitement of discovering new things"
"But, as others have said, the most important thing you need to do is make time to read"
You need to make the conscious decision to put the phone down and pick up a book.
What helped me get back to reading was diagnosis and medication
"Before that I was struggling to read for more than a few minutes and I was down to reading a couple of books a year.

Now I’m medicated I can read a couple of books a month, though I do still have to fight to make sure I don’t end up mindlessly watching YouTube or reading Reddit when I meant to read a book"
"Which manifests itself as putting my phone on the other side of the room and picking up my Kindle.

If you don’t have an ebook reader (and you are reading on a phone/tablet), get one"
"As long as you can physically separate yourself from your phone and pick up a device that just has books on, then things get a little easier"
But that still wouldn’t help for me without the medication.
I read much better on my Kindle
 I also need to schedule time for it.
"I have a similar story to yours, burned out of reading papers in college.

For me it was my partner… they’re a bookworm and being next to someone who was constantly reading made me feel like I wanted that again too.

Some things that have helped:

-Get a page turner! Or a couple while you get back into it.
-Don’t be hard on yourself (sometimes I can go months without touching my kindle and that’s ok!
-My kindle has helped me in not stressing about “having to finish a chapter”, so if I have time/focus to read just a paragraph or the whole thing it’s ok!
-Audiobook+text combo! If two (3 if you count holding the book) of my senses are involved it’s harder to get distracted!! Just make sure the audiobook is set to a speed that matches your eye speed.
-Read away from your phone/devices"
"And I mean AWAY, go to a cafe/park/trail and leave your phone, smartwatch, etc behind.
-Body double! Read next to someone else who’s reading, a library could be an option."
Reading is so difficult for me
It makes me tired
I have found that I can read in a distraction free zone and not at home
"Unless a book really sucks me in, I essentially can't read it."
"This is where I'm at, I can't find myself sitting/lying for long enough to be focused enough to read"
I have looked at some other strategies but haven't tried them yet
"One thing i found out was using music while reading, but using the same playlist each time and only for reading to trick your brain into associate that playlist with reading"
"Downside is this isn't a quick fix and takes time for it to take I'd wager.

Other than that is creating a reading environment, making sure it's calm, quiet and little distractions.

Downside when i read is I feel a deep urge to be checking my phone, looking things up or trying to worldbuild for DND because brain feel these things are time better spent"
"The amount i used to read as a teen is insane, now I'm lucky if I can get 5 pages read.

That being said another peice of advice that i just recalled while typing is to read as much as you feel you can then stop"
"The next time you pick it up try to read another X amount of pages/chapters, and effectively set an increasing goal each time you pick the book up.

Again, I haven't personally tried any of these, though now I feel like i really should kick myself into gear and try them XD"
Have you tried audiobooks? I am crushing books by having a  pleasant voiced adult read to me - lessss goooo!
"Audiobooks, short stories and novellas, and rereading childhood favorites helped me significantly with getting back into reading for pleasure"
Engaging nonfiction about things I am really into also helped
"

I went for probably a decade reading maybe a book or 2 a year if I was lucky"
"This year, I've already read over 40 books despite being incredibly busy and ridiculously stressed"
Last year I read more than 60.
"Audio book while doing another activity, then work up to listening while reading along, but listening to audio books is fine as well"
"that's such good advice, thank you! I've paused my series to type this to stop trying to divide my attention all the time (as if there's not enough going on in my head anyway)!
actually yesterday after reading all those answers here, I decided not to answer immediately but instead put my phone away and I actually read a few pages :) I'm trying to do the same tonight."
"thank you so much!

the last book I read was actually the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy, which I already read a few years ago and each part is very thin, so it feels achievable.

the last part about doing things poorly is so valuable actually"
"a few pages is better than nothing, twice a week is better than not at all and 1/3 of a book is better than not having read at all.

after reading all the comments here yesterday I actually put my phone away and read a few pages til I fell asleep :) I'll try to do the same today!"
"that sounds great :)
I usually read more than one book at the same time, so I can choose between something difficult, some easy fiction and an informative read."
"that sounds great! :)

yes I think your last point is the most important for me"
being intentional about it and actually deciding to read and then do it.
I'm actually good at reading
"when I just listen to something, I need something to do with my hands, otherwise my focus is gone within 20 seconds, but reading a book somehow works well for me"
"it's just about starting, like you said actually reading instead of reddit.

I have an ebook reader but I usually read paper books, so it always is separated from my phone, which is good."
"maybe you're more of a audiobook person? or, as someone suggested on here, listening to the audio book and reading along at the same time? (it's not for me, but as you have different issues with reading than I have, I might fit)"
"if I read, I usually do so before sleeping and then I get sad that I progress so slowly because I fall asleep all the time :D reading time in the day is even harder to do because there's so much other stuff that has to be done.

yesss try them :) as another commenter said: anything worth doing is worth doing poorly! that really helped me"
it's ok if you don't finish a book or if you just read 5 pages at a time.
"I listen to audiobooks when I knit or crochet :) but it's not the same as reading for me, as I'm a visual learner I think"
so I remember a lot more when I read it myself and I'm also more invested in the story
"but for less complicated and deep literature, I like the audiobooks :)"
"wow that's a lot!! great that you are in your reading era :D

I actually reread a thin book recently"
"still took me a fair amount of time, but seemed manageable as I knew that I liked it, had forgotten everything since the last time (yay adhd brain) and it was really thin so I could see some progress."
I have tried audiobooks but my mind just goes elsewhere and I forget what they're talking about
I can read while medicated though
I was given a sheet of Ritalin that I take whenever I absolutely have to and I was able to read ⅓ of a book in 3 hours

need to lock in but not motivated enough

"Speak to your GP if wanting the NHS route, or look for a private clinic if you are in a position to pay in excess of £800"
A lot of people I speak to who are waiting for the assessment is that it's year(s) long waitlists unfortunately
"

Right to Choose is the best way but wait times are not great"
Best thing prior to the appointment is to log as much evidence down as you can as to why you feel you need the referral
IF you can get people close by to give some supporting evidence too this will help also
I got my diagnosis recently
"I was getting far too tripped up with the waiting, referrals, GPs not knowing anything or dismissing me etc"
from the NHS
Ironically the process of getting a diagnosis is a nightmare for people with ADHD..
"so, that combined with the long waiting list (5 years where I am) made me go to a private clinic in the end"
I thought they were wonderful and really helpful - start to finish the process was 3 months
"It did cost over £1000, but if you can afford it then it's worth it to get the help you need."
"Brilliant, thank you for your help ❤️"
wow holy crap! the nhs system is fucked
It really is! There are so many wonderful caring people in it but the system is just so broken at the moment.
funnily enough i'm at uni to become a paramedic 🤣 hence why i want the diagnosis bcs studies are really starting to become hard for me
how are you finding it since you've been diagnosed?
"It's very recent so I'm still processing it really, despite having suspected it for about 4 years"
"Ironically it was at uni that I really started noticing my symptoms too, but I didn't know much about ADHD and had other mental co-morbidities so I didn't clock what it was"
I'm 32 now and sort of grieving the life that I could have had - I think my life could look very different if I'd have got a diagnosis and help sooner.

Don’t experience pressure or “due date” stress anymore.

Same here
It's pretty rough NGL
"Though for me it's only coz I'm tired of trying again and again without ever succeeding as well as I used to, or succeeding at all"
"I have coping strategies and am not afraid of failing but little did I know that even if you go in expecting to fail, knowing it's a part of the process, every man has his limit"
"Demotivation starts to set in, taking it's toll the more you try, little by little until your optimism collapses under the pressure"
I wish I had advice but we're in the same place.
"I think you can call this ""learned helplessness"", because you don't feel taking action is gonna change your situation after feeling failed many times"
"However it's just a brain trick all the time, I know this as I also feel trapped for 3 years at least, or maybe longer if covid is just a trigger"
"

I was supposed to finish my master thesis in 2021 but I felt too much and the deadline had been delayed for many times"
"I always felt I didn't do enough to start writing at that time, and I only met my professor online which makes me feel helpless when problems arise and communicating online can be inefficient"
" 

Recently I decided to change my life and pick up my thesis writing"
"While keeping contact with my supervisor I look back at our old chat messages, I realized I didn't do that ""little"" as I thought, and feeling helpless is the core of my problem"
"I don't care about ddl that much this time because I think that doesn't give me motivation, instead I try to find interesting points to reward myself keep doing the task"
And being as honest as possible to people who are there to help
"

I agree everything going online really sucks"
"Maybe you need to find other rewarding system to keep you moving, scaring yourself with consequences can't benefit you in long term"
Basically trying to build confidence on small tasks would be a good start I guess.
Sorry that you and others are feeling so down about this
I do know the feeling and it's a bit unnerving at first
Try not to judge yourself for it
What I found is that it's mostly a sign that you're ready for something new
"

In essence, this coping mechanism doesn't serve you anymore, which could end up being a good thing in the long term"
Using fear or panic as motivation is really bad for us both physically and mentally
"It's using a negative association (what punishment will I earn if I do a bad job?) that maybe you can now replace with a positive one (what reward will I earn if I do a good job?)

Your body/brain needs a different source of motivation"
"I don't think any of us can tell you what that's going to be, so you'll have to do some soul-seeking"
What inspires you? What are you passionate or curious about? What brings you joy or fulfillment? Take those answers and see how you can either shift your goals to either get you closer to those things or use them as rewards when you do reach deadlines
"

Best of luck to you🫰"
"Yup, I moved past looming deadline motivation to straight too burned out to care at some point"
I work from home and wonder if that motivation would come back if I worked in an office setting again.
I don't have any advice but I know the feeling
"I started uni in 2020 so right off the bat everything was online, and I still haven't been able to get into any form of routine as a student, it has just happened more and more over the past four years that I don't get that ""due date adrenaline"" until it's too late and not humanly possible to get it done in time.

I started my masters this august, a year late because of an exam I had to take from my bachelors because I'd spent 2/3 allowed attempts to take a week-long home exam just completely paralyzed until it was too late"
"Oh and for the third attemt, after having had the whole week to do it, I kept pushing it off until it was friday night and it was due at 2pm the following saturday"
"I had 24hrs extra time due to adhd, but I remember wishing I hadn't had that accommodation, because the only thing it did for me was give me 24 hours more to procrastinate an exam I put so much pressure on myself to do well that it had already paralysed me to the point of failing to complete it twice"
"And the best thing about that 24hrs extra time accomodation was that I ended up starting that saturday, which also happened to be my birthday, off with an all-nighter and then completely crashing at 2:15pm and spending the rest of my birthday completely knocked out after barely getting it in on time

And apparently I didn't learn, I literally just 2.5hrs ago had to submit a blank assignment after staying up for well over 24hrs because I was trying to do work we've had all semester to do"
"We had 6 assignments total in one class for the semester, and the first one was due in september (and of course I sent in a half-finished assingment, AND two days late), while the last five were all due today, but we were supposed to do them throughout the semester"
"We even had 2-5 hours a week set aside for guidance on the assignments (it's an ArcGIS course, so not writing assingments), but I could never get up early enough, so I never went and it just came to the point where I was ashamed to show up because I didn't want the lecturer to see how far behind I was"
"And now, since I didn't get it done in time, I'm not eligible to take the exam and have to retake the whole class if I want to get my degree"
"I worked on it for like 18 hours straight, and didn't spend time procrastinating around the house, but I spent so much time nitpicking on datasets and things I knew I shouldn't have been prioritising, and when I looked at the time again after what I thought had been 40 minutes, almost five hours had just vanished and I didn't get the proper stress until about 2,5 hours before the deadline but by then it was already a lost cause as I only had about 1/3 of the assignments half-finished.

I'm sorry this was so long, I guess I just needed to rant a bit"
"It just feels like a massive failure every time I end up in these situasions, because everyone around me seems to be on top of stuff like this, meanwhile I've barely been holding my head above water the last four months"
"And added onto that, just pulling off deadlines I shouldn't be able to, and still get good grades has been my modus operandi since I was 12"
"No matter what other methods I try nothing seems to stick, and after relying on the pressure of an approaching deadline to get me in the zone for 11 years, suddenly not being able to do that anymore just adds on to the pile of shit that already is living with adhd.

  
Edit: typo"
I haven't felt it since starting adhd meds
"Even if I dont take them, I just can't feel it the same (though I've only ever tried a single day at most, maybe it would come back if I stopped the meds for longer)"
I've accepted I am not capable of doing 4 weeks of work in 40 minutes anymore
But I can now do 15 minutes every week for 4 weeks and be fine
"And yeah, it might take more time"
But it's quality time as I remember and profit from those 4 weeks
Previously in my childhood I'd finish everything in one go and then it would be wiped out of my mind
The only thing I really got from my entire experience studying was the diploma
I remember so little
Had to learn most again as I go 😭
"don't have an answer for you, so i'll just commiserate 

i also haven't felt that stress for a while and it's making uni hell"
"i'll stay up during the night to do *something* for the next day of classes, but i just end up procrastinating til the morning and skipping the classes

the closest thing i felt to it in a while was today, i skipped 2 classes that i really needed to go to, felt very guilty and i channeled it into washing the dishes lol"
"i'm thinking that maybe it's possible to to use this, like if i'm feeling very guilty about not doing project x i'll have a lot of trouble working on it, but maybe i could channel it into working on project y, and get everything done in this roundabout way

i think one reason i stopped feeling it was because i don't entirely know how to get those things done anyway?"
"A number of professionals have told me this is normal as people with ADHD age—you get overexposed or the consequences get you a few times and your brain figures out they aren’t that bad, etc"
"It’s coming for all of us, basically"
"That, for me, was when all the other coping mechanisms and structures that people talked about made sense/were needed"
"Before none of them would work as good as that last minute panic but now they’re the only option 🫠

Also honestly it turns out a lot of the most essential parts of adulthood aren’t single item due date things anyway, so even if i still had it i don’t think it would be as useful for a lot of stuff"
Thanks for Asking
I've been meaning to and putting it off
"

I warn my younger ADHD folks that they can't rely on that forever now"
I'm literally ruining my life and all I can do is watch.
"Coping strategies tend to become less effective the more we use them (at least with me they did) that first time you miss a deadline and the consequence isn't as catastrophic as you thought it might be your brain goes ""huh.."
"Maybe I don't need to stress so much"" and missing the next deadline becomes a little bit easier until you know the people you can miss deadlines with and those you can't. 


If medication isn't an option for you to try then my next suggestion would be trying to find a few new coping strategy that work for you"
"Personally talking to someone on the phone while I did tasks made it a lot easier for me to focus until I did it every day for a couple weeks straight. 


Habit stacking is also a good way to help build a routine"
"Take a habit you already do and add the new habit right before or after your current one. 


Then when you become re-sensitized  to missing deadlines you can begin to occasionally incorporate that back into your tool belt of strategies when you need it. 


You can also try to incorporate a sense of your own identity or emotion with the thing you want to change one example would be saying ""I am a person who completes things on time"" and even when you don't continue to repeat that same phrase to yourself and get the thing you're behind on done. 


Unfortunately there is no silver bullet (not even medication) and implementing several of these strategies will require a degree of vulnerability and honesty with yourself and others to begin implementing, but recognizing the problem is the first step to correcting it!!!! 


And additionally, when you find yourself doing the bad habit recognize that you are doing it and stop it"
You will never drop a habit cold turkey but you will slowly chip away at it by recognizing and redirecting until it is not as big of an issue
This happened to me after I started treatment
I am not sure what to do about it 
"That happened to me once I got on anxiety meds for my anxiety, and I'm honestly both thankful for it and hate it"
I used to be a straight A student
Third in my hs class
"Now I struggle some in college, but I also have so much less background anxiety"
I've found that sitting with my work open for a while helps to get me to do it more often and that ensuring I'm fed and medicated beforehand is a tremendous help.
it happens with me too like i will rush an assignment 3 hrs before its due and still procrastinate and finally end up not submitting just bcuz..
i don't feel the pressure anymore
Same! I haven't felt it since I started ADHD meds
"It's nice to not feel that constant stress/pressure, but I'm still not sure how to get anything done now 😔"
My therapist tells me this is a good thing lol
Def doesn’t feel like it tho
Oddly this started happening to me as I got medicated for ADHD
The meds have removed that extra anxiety I used as a way to be on time
I have to be extra careful now because I’m more relaxed and can slip up with time management.
Yes! I would say it happened around COVID also
Ran out of all my fucks to give witnessing the cluster that was 2020-21
"My job has desensitized me to pressure.  Everything is always an emergency.  The boss comes up with new emergencies before we've finished dealing with previous ones.  So, that must mean nothing is important."
"It's called burnout haha

I know cause I'm having one right now"
Well I failed my masters degree because of this
Why? No idea but it crashed and burned to the point of zero care from me.
Yep
We burnt that fuse out during lockdown.
I’m curious how much of it is the pressure going away vs changes in the environment
"For me, I lived a digital nomad style life and I felt the pressure"
"Now having settled into a stable place, the pressure is completely gone"
"

I can’t figure out whether the deadline was the only trigger, or if it needed something else for the recipe, such as constantly moving from place to place, spartan hotel rooms, working in cafes where power and wifi isn’t always reliable"
"

I suspect it’s partially the environment because I tried to get 3 different majors in university (art, music, business) and I responded differently in each"
"

My recommendation is to think back to when you could feel the pressure, and try to replicate the environment bit by bit"
It won’t be exact but can certainly try.
I’ve seen similar questions to mine and there’s basically no answer to it
People like you and I are left commenting for help with nobody to give advice (or that’s what it feels like)
"I hope we find a way out soon, that goes for anybody reading this too."
"Thanks for sharing, has resonance."
Mhmm scaring my self had been my go to to get stuff done for 30 years
And it’s gone really malfunctioning on me
Anyone who got out of this pattern?
This is such a a great comment and it's similar to what I'm experiencing right now
"This school semester I also lost that sense of urgency and anxiety over deadlines, and I reached a state of depression where I just did not have any motivation or energy to get things done. 


But then it also made me dig in deep into my soul and I realized that it's not that I'm giving up, the one thing I'm passionate about is still there, but that the current way of things is not working for me"
"That if I want to finish my degree, I need to do things differently and at a pace that works for me"
"This also pushed me to seek outside help in the form of accomodations and support.


So just as you said, these feelings are just a sign that things need to change"
Whatever that change is depends on the person
"But we should not be hard on ourselves, and we should not give up. "
Wise words my brother
I hope i could do what you saying but i don't know how to replace the panic motivation..
It's much more powerful than any reward
Pretty much my entire childhood depended on it.
"I really want to find another source of motivation than fear and criticism, but I don’t know where to start"
I want to finish my PhD in a healthy way and take the next step based on internal motivation
How to start looking for my source while staying in the same job?
exactly described my master study life..
"can't start until the final day, missing ddl but extension didn't really help, prioritizing problems when time is limited..."
Same
This
Same .
after you started meds?
Me too
I’m not a student but I am a week past an important work deadline
Normally I would freak out and take extreme measures to get it done… now I’m just experiencing stress cognitively but not really feeling it I can’t get anything done
I’m not sure if it’s better or worse.
But how is it good?
if i had to guess it forces you to develop other more sustainable solutions

"Dude idk if I’m just getting older or just forgetting stuff more, but I notice when I am put on the spot I forget most things, especially numbers."
Have you had bloodwork done? I'm specifically thinking your B12 levels? Losing that type of memory seems like it could be more than your ADHD
I have epilepsy and didn't know the medication I was on lowered B12 absorption...I was forgetting things that should not be forgotten and almost failed out of a semester of college
It wasn't until I started to have signs of aphasia that I was sent for bloodwork and my B12 levels were dangerously low.
This is why I always opt for biometics when I can
"I can't remember passwords or codes, at least not until I have used them so long it's time to change them, lol.

My wife is signing up for health insurance, this morning at 6:30 she asked me for my social security number"
"Mind you, this is a number I took great pride in memorizing finally"
"Nope, stupid brain was drawing a blank"
I finally puzzled it out but I felt so disappointed in myself.
It’s ok once I was getting gas and put my debit card back in my purse
"Then I couldn’t find it thinking id left it in the kiosk, freaked out, and cancelled it"
Right after I get off the phone with the card company I find that I put it in a different pocket than normal
Had I just checked all the pockets I’d be fine but I immediately had forgotten where I had left it even though I explicitly put it in my purse
Sometimes our brains just block things out for no reason 😩
You could tell this story with all the exact same facts in a more useful way
One that brings you more peace and empowerment
"
   
Like, you wrote it down? And you remembered? And you found it? That's a lot of things you did really well"
"Like, really really well"
That's so lucky and helpful of you to do that for yourself before and then resourceful and successful to capitalize on your preparation
"
     
What else went right? What else could have gone badly or in the past would have gone differently?
        
Your brain automatically focuses on worst case scenarios and bad things"
It's supposed to
What's also supposed to happen is you deliberately spend a lot of time feeling safe and happy and thus naturally balance out all thar focus on negative scary stuff with focus on positive calming stuff
"
       
What happens is we get so scared and overwhelmed that we can't maintain that balance, and the system of a human being doesn't work well when it's stuck focused on scary dangerous negative stuff it doesn't know what to do with"
We're not built to experience that
"
   
Internally, I mean"
That internal felt experience of danger or safety and how important and correct it is to focus on something.
This is why you put all those notes and other random pieces of paper with passcodes etc
"in one place lol, good thing you managed to save it.
Also with passwords, when possible use whole words"
"They are easier to remember (really works too! :3) *and* they are more secure, 5 words and higher and you passphrase will confuse even buildings full of supercomputers."
"I think we’ve all been in a similar situation, it sucks and you’ll probably hate yourself for it for a short while but eventually you’ll forget and move on"
"

Keep your head up, at least you didn’t completely lock yourself out"
Numbers are the like the only thing I can remember

I can remember phone numbers I haven't called in 15 years.

you have adhd"
"it’s okay, you’re not broken or stupid, but you have adhd"
that’s how it goes sometimes
allow yourself to make mistakes
it’s okay!
"God I feel this so much, sometimes I walk into a room only to forget why I even went in there, go back to my room and remember why I was in the room"
Woulda liked for the brain to tell me why I was there in the first place instead of playing a game of change places until I figure it out on my own.
"Oh yeah, I feel you , and I’ve done waaaay worse things"
"I’ve lost so much money, time, self respect, relationships even"
And other people have done worse things still
"(Shit happens!) your night of panic and frustration is a big drag and probably womped your nervous system something fierce, but it doesn’t make you a bad person"
"Nor does it make you stupid, lazy, worthless, or any of the other names your Inner Judge might be inserting"
Let’s forgive ourselves for all the past missteps
Let’s love the mistakes and choose learning from them over being damaged by them 
We’re human
"
And also, you dodged a bullet there…so fair play to ya!"
The worst ADHD moment of your life..
so far
" Jokes aside, I'm sorry to hear it"
 It's a brutal condition we live with
 You are not alone
" I forgot a code that I use on my debit card, despite having used it for like 15 years."
"When you actively don't remember something, you are much better off to just take a quick note, and go do something else.

One of my biggest hurdles is getting myself to move off of a task that my mind is road-blocking"
" I've noticed that if I let myself lock up, I will just abandon any productivity completely, but if I just say, no big deal, we'll come back to it, and go to the next thing, I can keep my productivity up"
" At some point the thing you needed to remember will clearly pop in your mind, and you can make a quick choice to move back to the original task, or just write it down, and come back to it when you complete your current task.

We know everyone ADHD and non ADHD included, benefit from being in flow state, so in seeking that state, it's best to just jump over obstacles, rather than to dismantle them and lose momentum."
that happened to me once but it was the lock code on the house… i left my phone inside of course
thank god i remembered it after like 30 minutes
That's why I'm trying to lock everything with my fingerprint whenever possible
"Man, I feel your pain, had this happened to me 2 years ago, I was working the whole day out of town, as I was heading back to my workplace I tried to unlocked my phone and I find myself trying to figure out what my password was, all because after a few months with my phone password I stopped thinking of it, and just doing it by muscle memory, In my case I did not write the password down, so as you could expected I spend my whole night factory restoring my phone while hating myself and trying to find meaning on my existence (;"
"Just here for solidarity, and to say that I recently bought a plane ticket to the right place, on the completely wrong day"
I showed up to the airport and couldn’t figure out why my confirmation code didn’t work
"Even taking (what I thought was) extreme care to “not screw up” my reservation, getting to the airport way ahead of time and doing everything I could to account for my raging ADHD, I still managed to pull one of the most expensive and stressful adhd moments of my life.

Several days later I lost my brand new driver’s license THE DAY AFTER it arrived in the mail"
Along with the brand new wallet I bought and all the cards I had also just replaced
"😩 

So yeah"
I have yet to figure out why but it seems like my adhd symptoms follow a pattern where they are particularly bad every few months or so
"I have yet to figure out the particular triggers, but stress seems to be the unifying factor.

Medication hasn’t helped with the absent-minded aspect of my adhd nearly as much as just rest, self-care, and having compassion for myself."
"These kinds of things have to me all the time, and it's really hard to have compassion with myself when I get so frustrated"
I've gone grocery shopping before and then gotten in the subway to go home and have left my bags of groceries on the train
100s of $$$ of money wasted
"Once, I made it all the way home before I realized"
"I entered my apartment, smiled, saw my partner, and said happily, ""I bought groceries!"" He looked around and said, ""Where are they?"" I just screamed"
😱
"Oh gosh, I've definitely done almost this exact thing a couple of times back before I even knew I had ADHD and used said pass code regularly (before biometrics were an option)"
"

What I would say though, is it might help to separate the idea of your 'entire life' from a piece of technology"
"It can be super duper frustrating to not remember something, but if something like that happens again, I might help to pause and reflect on a couple of things.

1 - Is this truly an emergency? It can certainly induce a sense of panic to be locked out of your phone, but what is so important on there that you need to access it at this immediate time?

2 - Are you just tired or experiencing a temporary 'memory error?' When this happens to our devices, we usually have to turn them off and back on again or wait awhile and then it ends up working just fine"
Our brains need this too sometimes
"If you could put your phone away and distract yourself with something else and get some rest, I bet the next morning you would unlock it without thinking twice"
"

3 - Is there something more positive I could channel this energy into? One great thing I've found that is common with ADHD is the great collection of hobbies and interests that I have accumulated"
"If I was locked out of my phone, I could still watch a show or movie on tv, crochet something, or maybe take advantage of the phoneless time to actually tidy up around the house since I'm usually procrastinating/ distracting myself from those things with I'm on my phone"
"

I think it could help to spend some time outside / in nature, getting involved in some kind of recreational sports or clubs, and building up some hands-on hobbies"
"The more you can build up parts of your life that are off of your phone, the less you may be distressed by not having access to it for a few hours"
"

Anyway, we all forget things sometimes, but it's better to be able to laugh it off and know it's not the end of the world."
I totally get this
Every time I struggle to remember something or have to do a task slower to make sure I don't make errors makes me feel like such a failure
"However, for me, it helps to remember that I'm not a failure"
"My brain works differently, and I simply need to accommodate myself"
"Perhaps, in your case, you need a passkey notebook you can keep out on a counter or another location you see/check every day"
Adhd has so many ups and downs.
I got locked of my iPhone a while back and only had one more attempt before it permanently locked
I didn’t even write it down and had to get an old MacBook I haven’t used in a year just to factory reset my phone instead of it being disabled forever
I have a whole masters but still forgot so please don’t be hard on yourself
We are all human and make mistakes
You were able to account for your vulnerabilities by taking action beforehand even if you forgot
Trust me you’re more capable than you think!
Data security has to ride a very fine line between being insecure and being useless
You just went over that line a little bit
The scenario you described probably plays out thousands of times per day
"A trip to the Apple store would have sorted it out for you, had you not found your code"
"

Don't beat yourself up about it because it happens to everyone eventually"
It was just your day.
Wow! I relate to this soooo much
Yeah the forgetting but more so the spinning into a panic and being unable to think of the logical solution I myself prepared for the moment
"I hate myself for months because of in the moment decisions or non-decisions that seem simple and straightforward when I look back.

Thank you for sharing"
"I put up sticky notes everywhere with the words, ""Stop!"" and ""Breathe!"" on them"
"Not full proof but has helped.

I hope you get a better night's rest OP"
I did that just last month lol
I always open my phone instantly without an issue and then all of a sudden I did it wrong like 12 times and I couldn't figure out why
I stepped away for a few minutes and just tried it again and it worked
I don't know what I wrote differently
Weird as hell
"man, that sucks"
"
today i had to give my address to a friend, the home i've been living in for 6 months now, and i just forgot"
"i totally forgot my house number which consists in three numbers (its literally 345, couldnt be easier)"
"Choose a word to spell out instead of numbers? It works for my SO who has number challenges.

If it makes you feel any better, my worst adhd moment was probably executive disfunction-ing myself into getting my drivers license suspended."
Please be kind to yourself!!!!  You are literally doing the best you can!!  You’re already exhausted from the crazy night so can you please have compassion for yourself and not make yourself feel even more dysregulated?  You figured it out
You got yourself safe
Be kind to you
You went through a hard and scary thing and survived it
Be good to you
"You can make contingency plans later, tomorrow"
Today we rest and take pride in our ability to figure it out under duress.
"Very tough, OP"
🤗
That’s the thing for me
"Is it because I am older? Is the ADHD get worse or am going crazy, but why at sometimes am I missing basic information like someone name or worse my phone passcode I enter several times a day.its almost like, what am I doing again."
A friend casually but unexpectedly asked me how old I am (22!) a few days ago and I was so embarrassed that I actually had to think about it.
lately I'm like a deer in headlights when someone ask for my birthday
THE DAY I WAS CREATED? HOW DO I FORGET THAT? and my body auto pilots out of shear anxiety and always answers for me and the auto answer has always been correct but like some day it might not be lmao...
Check out Nooceptin
"Not at all associated with the company, but completely amazed at the cognitive improvement it has made"
"
Been using it for 3 years now and everyone (including myself) can tell when I've missed a couple of days' worth of doses"
" 
The difference is incredible."
I love this reply
"Well said! 
(Though that last thought seems left unfinished; well this is an ADHD thread, after all)"
I use my password manager for most things.
"You can do this with the 4 digit passcode too! If you remember T9, just find a word you remember over a number string.

Mine has always been the Roman numeral letters for the Super Bowl my favorite team won"
Or just do the year of something you always remember
"As a person legit unable to do mental math and hold onto numbers in my brain, anything I can do to make it word-based is crucial"
"Maaan I envy you so much, I can’t remember numbers, no names (except if I ask the person for their name two times right after I meet them and then I associate with an object or a physical characteristic) with the only thing I am good one is faces, I can’t remember numbers recognize people that I’ve seen only one time even if I never meet them, just saw them on a public space"
SAME!
"I stand in line and enter my card, but I don’t know the passcode"
There like 20 ppl behind me my anxiety goes through the roof
My thoughts are always left unfinished.

"At first I didn't feel any different, then I started work and when I realized how much I was getting done and how easy it was for me to recognize when I was getting distracted and stop that to refocus I almost cried"
Like wow what a difference it makes
I don't take it on Saturday to give my brain a break from being quiet and let the natural chaos of myself live for a bit (can get some good ideas through the chaos sometimes) but overall it was amazing how much of a difference it made.
"We are the same age, and I started my routine (different med but same idea here) literally a week ago - and I truly feel the difference"
I read that and I just want to say this completely mirrors my experience and sentiment about this to the tee..
"That's crazy! 

Not that I have a lot of advice to give, but I started documenting my room/living space with pictures every other day or so, and plan on looking back at it on a month to see how far I've come"

"Day 2, same thing, but I got it a little more organized"
Day 3..
"so on and so on - hell by day 5 I am no longer afraid to keep my door open when I'm not home to hide the mess, but still have work to do"
"Additionally I'm keeping track of the things I struggled with doing that I never followed through with (this day I did this and actually made progress"" etc.), I figure this will allow me to have a better sense of gratitude and clear evidence of progress"

It certainly depends on your country and whether you go private or not

"In my experience, being too invested in a person or social construct without reciprocity, mutual understanding and acceptance of each other is not beneficial but likely adverse"
"This can apply to friends, partners, colleagues and even family"
"

For how a crush and a hyper-focus on a person differs, I think the first is more aware of its circumstances and includes acceptance"
"Hyper-focus might or might not be aware of its circumstances, hard to accept and can lead a person to disregard their wellbeing, values, responsibilities or needs"
"

If I had to sum it up I’d say, a crush is closer to having a sudden interest in a person while hyper-focus is a sudden inability to disengage from focusing on a person even if harmful."
I would hyperfixate on people but I had no idea about hyperfixations or adhd at the time and it felt like my love for them is never going to end
Then I realized that they were just hyperfixations and I set my expectations by also thinking that it's just a hyperfixation so that I wouldn't be disappointed more
And now there's a girl that I like
"I waited for my hyperfixation to go away, I knew that it was just a hyperfixation but turns out I was really in love with her"
"So even though they may not be hyperfixations, just think about them as just a hyperfixation so that you won't get disappointed if they really are just hyperfixations."
"I used to do this as a teenager but it was an unconscious maladaptive reaction to abuse, neglect and abandonment"
It used to repel people.
The only way I know I fancy someone is if I’m hyper focused on them
And if I’m stalking them…well that’s true love!!!
"Thank you for your response, it's very helpful"
"What do you mean by a crush is more aware of its circumstances?

I have had hyperfocus on ideas before, and felt an out of control inability to stop researching it to the point of being overwhelmed and wanting to be rid of it - wanting to throw my phone in the river, wanting to fall asleep and wake up when it is over, washing my face repeatedly to try and get ride of the feeling"
I was aware that it was a hyperfocus though.
"This is lovely and really helpful.

I am sure it will fade"
"Even with my partner I hyperfocus on them a few times a year, but I still love them when I am not hyperfocused as well"
"It's just very intense and 'world changing' and uncomfortable when I do obsess.

I suppose that is what I'd do anyway, let it pass, because as I say, I have no intention of ever doing anything about it if it was a crush"
But a crush is much easier to deal with I think as it doesn't make u wanna be detrimental
"I think i just wouldn't feel so guilty about it if it was a hyperfocus, but having a crush kinda feels in appropriate."
I think a ‘crush’ is more in tune with reality
As if having a crush also involves realizing it’s a crush and may or may not mean more one day
Or understanding it might have to be let go because circumstances don’t allow a positive outcome
That’s what I tried to fit in to “aware of its circumstances” which was a very tall order in retrospect lol
My bad 😅
"Okay fair, maybe it's a crush then because I absolutely know I want to be with my partner and would do nothing to jepordize that"
I just hate how it feels like the world has changed and I am absolutely out of control and can't stop picking and digging and hating myself for it.

Are you medicated? Do you have a therapist? Raw dogging life is super hard
I’ve taken meds for years and have been in therapy (less frequent than meds cuz $$$) and it’s really helped me.
Realize that you are the fish made to climb trees
"I use positive affirmations, very first thing, every morning"
It does help a lot.
Invest in learning more about ADHD and how to manage it
You’ll be surprised to see how much can be done to manage it’s symptoms
Highly recommend checking out Dr
Russell Barkley on YouTube.
"I don't think this is an ADHD thing, so this is probably not the best sub to post it in to get the most relevant advice"
"

However, there are some people who have deep insecurities and this is why they tend to be upset with when other people have stuff"
I think you'd have to look at that and maybe look at some subs on
I don't know insecurity and being better I don't know
I'm sure there are lots of them and it's based on positive and self-love
But depends on how deep your insecurities are.
"This happens to all people, at different scales"
"
Gratitude thoughts on a daily bases help"
" 
Grateful you have hair :), grateful you have a body that works, grateful you have this group to express yourself, grateful you can go to the gym, grateful you can eat food vs"
Not
"Grateful you have feet to take you to the gym, grateful you have the insight to see and understand this feeling"
" 
You are not your body, you are not your mind"
You are here to develop through learnings
"Everyday is an opportunity, for you, for all of us"
 No one is perfect
"We are just flawed humans, here to help each other through it all."
"There's a part from Clarissa Estés ""women who run with wolves"" I think of sometimes"
"

""I have been taken with the way wolves hit their bodies together when they run and play, the old wolves in their way, the young ones in theirs, the skinny ones, the fat ones, the long-legged, the lop-tailed, the floppy-eared, the ones whose broken limbs healed crookedly"
"They all have their own body configurations and strengths, their own beauty"
They live and play according to what and who and how they are
"They do not try to be what they are not.

Up in the northlands, I watched one old wolf who had only three legs; she was the only one who could fit through a crevasse where blueberries were branching"
I once saw a gray wolf crouch and leap in such a flash it left the image of a silver arc in the air for a second afterward
"I remember a delicate one, a new mother, still fulsome in the belly, picking her way through the pool moss with the grace of a dancer.

Yet, despite their beauty and ability to stay strong, wolves are sometimes talked about in this way: “Ah, you are too hungry, your teeth are too sharp, your appetites too interested.’' Like wolves, women are sometimes discussed as though only a certain temperament, only a certain
restrained appetite, is acceptable"
"And too often added to that is an attribution of moral goodness or badness according to whether a woman’s size, height, gait, and shape conform to a singular or exclusionary ideal"
"When women are relegated to moods, mannerisms, and contours that conform to a single ideal of beauty and behavior, they are captured in both body and soul, and are no longer free.""

It's funny how we're taught to look at our nature as a personal failing, but a lot of that has its roots in old racist imperialist ways of looking at things, like there's only one right way to be a human"
"But we didn't choose our nature, all we can do is do our best with the hand we're dealt, you know? I'm not going to shit on my cat just because she's got an anxiety disorder, though it sure would be nice if she was more cooperative about taking her chill pills"
I have an aunt that used to have a fat cat
"Lucy used to be homeless and I think never got used to the idea that she wouldn't struggle to find food again, so that old insecurity led to overeating if she had access to too much food"
"

But cats are awesome, and it's not their fault"
"So they're easy to love in spite of their flaws, as long as they aren't dicks that randomly attack you or something"
Weird how much more slack we're willing to offer to cats vs humans
"Or other humans we care about vs ourselves even, it's easy to be hardest of all on ourselves"
Or that's how it is for me at least
"

There's a tough flip side too though"
Succeeding financially means we can help others instead of being a burden
"If we're not physically attractive to a crush, it sucks feeling rejected"
"So there's costs that can come from not being good enough, either failing at something we're trying to do, or just intrinsically not being the kind of person we wish we were"
"Especially sucks if the goals we want to achieve aren't really a fit for us, easy to feel cheated then, or like a failure.

So.."
"I don't know, it's tough"
"One thing I've noticed though, it's MUCH easier to succeed when we're feeling confident and safe"
Learning to accept yourself as you are while still doing your best and finding those goals that suit who you are..
"I guess that's the challenge of life.

There's no easy way to get to more self acceptance, but I do think one place to start is thinking about how you feel about others"
"Unless you're really judgemental, haha"
Then I guess you'll have to work on that too
"(Cat, why can't you be skinny and smarter?)."
"Hi there, something you said in your post stuck out to me:

> I honestly am trying to love myself the way I am"
"But I feel that I need to be the best or others will not love me, or I will not be loved enough, and I just constantly feel I am a failure.

I did Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) and of the biggest breakthroughs I had was on this exact thing.

It sounds like you are trying to figure out how to love yourself _even though_ you are not perfect"
"

The truth is, you are already worthy just as you are"
Everyone is deserving of love
"It’s good to have the desire to improve and be better, because it gives us purpose and motivation, but I want you to know that you are already worth it today just as you are."
i’ve never related to anything more in my life
I often get told i’m beautiful but i simply cannot believe it because the woman next to me is prettier
it’s ruining my relationship because i don’t think im good enough for my boyfriend or anyone if im not the best.
I feel like I can relate to most of the stuff you mentioned and I feel your pain
"Anyway I too am looking for help on the same issues, it’s a lot of things happening for people like us, with many challenges to face inside and out that it’s difficult to love ourselves"
"

I don’t know you but my own insecurities came from childhood feelings of not feeling loved or perceiving it as that, coupled with perfectionism and constant comparisons to others"
"Therefore I think it’s important to find people who uplift you and understand what you’re going through, or can validate your feelings and emotions"
Surround yourself with more positive articles and posts about loving the self and spend time in nature or to meditate also helps.
Meditation and a good workout routine helps
I used to be an envious person
It became very detrimental to my personality and made it hard to make friends
"I don't know what changed exactly, when, or how, but I just decided that I'd turn my envy into admiration"
"Instead of constantly comparing myself to others, I decided I could appreciate and enjoy beauty in others without having to think it was MY standard"
"It's not easy, especially when your brain just falls into the same old patterns, but it becomes easier as you realize you're enough just the way you are"
"
Compliment others freely, but honestly, instead of holding onto comparative thoughts"
"It helps you let go of jealousy and makes you feel generous and kind, and helps give you more confidence, which is key to overcoming the feeling of failure"
 Compliment yourself
Smile  more
"
Good luck on your journey"
I hope you can give yourself the love and support you deserve.
You are not alone and  you deserve love
"It would not be easy, but you definitely would have to notice when you're doing this and try to curb the behavior"
Don't be so hard on yourself
Take the wins where you can
"You go to the gym, try to be healthier,  the progress you made,  etc"
Don't focus on others so much
" Obviously way easier said than done.


For me I'm not so concerned with others, but I'm extremely harsh on myself for my own faults"
The emotional disregulation issue may have something to do with it
" I'm extremely kind and empathetic to others going through hard times,  yet extending that same kindness inwards is a difficult concept."
I am not on medication
I have other issues and medication is not a good idea for me
"


However I am not in therapy either"
"I only realised how important it was after years of debating my adhd diagnosis, I got diagnosed for the 5th time the other day"
"She explained everything.

Yesss the money is so much"
"I have to have a special diet I am chronically coeliac, so that costs so much"
Therapy on top leads me nearly bankrupt every month
It definitely should not be this way! Same with meds!
I have started doing this
"Just takes motivation to keep it up.

Thinking maybe doing affirmations throughout the day may be easier for me."
Check out or listen to ADHD 2.0 by Hallowell and Ratey
"It has a really good overview of ADHD and talks about a lot of non-medication things that you can do to reduce your ADHD symptoms.  So even if you're not medicated, at least you're doing something that can help with those things. 


And while stimulants are usually the first line treatment for people with meds, if they're not a good fit for you, non-stimulants can help quite a bit and are usually pretty inexpensive"
The generics usually don't cost that much per month
"When I dug into it earlier this month, I was surprised to see that a meta-analysis (of 133 previous studoies) published in Lancet in 2018 found that, for adults, Strattera was as effective in reducing ADHD symptoms as stimulants"
"I don't recall how Wellbutrin came out, but it's probably similar in efficacy."
Honestly it doesn’t even have to be ADHD specific medication
I struggle with the exact same thing and my antidepressants have really helped with that
But I understand it is hard to get ahold of a psych even if you did have the money 😭
"When I started Strattera, I thought it “wasn’t doing anything” until I tried going off of it (with my doctor’s approval) and boy did I see the difference! I’m on a combination of Strattera and Concerta now, and while I usually skip the stim if I forget to take it by noon and just grab a coffee instead, I never skip the Strattera because it has such a massive effect on my energy levels."

All I can offer is empathy
I’ll have people say things to me and I’ll just stare at them and forget to respond
When someone is judging me or criticizing me even delicate and polite
I just can’t stand it as I try really hard to be as good as possibly can
Often hears shit with no connection with reality
And this is when I drop it and leave
Dude I feel the exact same way with my girlfriends dad
"Very nice guy, has interesting things to say, sometimes it's easy and other times I freeze in thoughts."
I feel this way with people who say everything in details
Like I don’t care what juice you were drinking when you saw someone getting hurt!
"I feel you… have you ever tried to look for a solution? For me, I sometimes simulate the conversation before I talk to them"
Just started Vyvanse
It’s helped a little bit but I still think I’m on too low of a dose (30 mg) for it to be effective
"

I have learned that I unconsciously don’t follow a lot of social norms as a result of ADHD though"
"Much like you, I’m much more quiet and don’t really fit the “talking over people” stereotype.

You’re right in your assessment in that it’s kind of a freezing paralysis"
It’s usually small talk
"I over analyze what another person has said, even if it’s simple"
I think non adhd people go on auto pilot for these types of convos.

"That’s insanely high for a resting heart rate
I’m on vyvanse and mine went up from 65 to 75
Same mg"
"I had an increase, but more like resting HR from 55 to 65"
"Yours seems really high, I would consider going to the ER to get it checked out"
"Are you having any anxiety about your response to the drugs that could inflate these numbers? Also seems odd for a doctor to start someone on meds like these for the first time, then go on holiday"
You got an EKG before starting right?
Definitely recommend seeing a cardiologist
I take a beta blocker (Propranolol) with my stimulants because it elevates my heart rate and it helps prevent/mitigate that
"However, yours seems very high"
"I think the sooner you can get into a doctor, the better.."
Yeah I thought so too
"It’s a shame, I was really excited to be on meds and the benefits have been so great."
"Thanks for the response, definitely I will investigate it further"
My doctor works at a really reputable place but he didn’t do an EKG/ECG and yeah he’s on holiday now..

You probably have much more responsibilities now that require executive functioning.
My therapist told my ex that my symptoms were never going to be better than they were at that moment
"I'm 53, diagnosed about 2 years into that marriage, and I'm pretty sure that's the day my ex completely checked out of the marriage"
"

I would have to say I agree, at least to an extent"
Areas I struggle in have become somewhat larger struggles over the past decade
"On the flip side, as I've gotten older and have been through a decade+ of therapy, I know more about myself than I ever have"
I can see potential obstacles ahead and can make them non-issues before they present themselves
"I've also found a partner who loves me for who and what I am - ALL of me, ADHD included"
"Her presence, positivity, and love have been a game changer.

Don't let getting older scare you"
Meds help
"Therapy will help, not at all with ADHD, but it will help with any and all of the ancillary aspects of it, especially if you suffer from depression and/or anxiety like many of us so"
"

This is the first time in my adult life I feel 100% Me, and it's fucking amazing."
Mine ramped up HARD when I hit perimenopause
It was manageable until then but suddenly I was walking through brain fog thick as pea soup
Meds help but it's just a bandaid on a bullet hole
"Out of curiosity is your sex male or female? I'm always curious about the male/female difference and feel like I see more genetic women complaining about this? (If you're male you're totally throwing my argument off lol).

I get you though"
I feel the same way
Maybe try taking melatonin and Magnesium for sleep? It's helped me out a lot.
"definitely manifests more due to added responsibility, and having to make and work by your own schedule"
"also just that the things you do from day to day are harder i think? for example when i was in primary school i still couldnt focus for shit but i was really good at maths so id pay bare minimum attention and blitz through my work, but at the time it worked because it was simple maths, then it was much the same through high school until more advanced math classes when i wouldn’t pay attention then if i didnt understand the motivation just disappeared"
now i find myself leaving university lectures not even remembering half of what was discussed sometimes
"so its definetely circumstantial to some degree, there are a lot more thoughts in your brain than when you were younger, which is okay! just need to try and not beat yourself up about having bad days etc"
"we’re all learning how to live, no ones an expert."
I wonder this too! I’m 38 and have been in the same career for 10 years
I’ve been on meds for 2 years
Some things in my life haven’t changed much at all but I feel like I struggle a lot more than I used to
So is it getting older? I feel like that has to play a role
My capacity to do activities and put up with stress must have been different at 28
"Or could it be all the stress of coping without a diagnosis or medication has worn me down? Or all of the above? 

I don’t think I’ll ever have the answer"
All I can do is try to get better at recognizing when I’m running out of steam and try to care for my needs instead of constantly trying to push through the stress and fatigue.
I felt like my symptoms got worse too after i moved out of my parents house but for me I think its bcuz when I lived with my parents they would make me follow their routine and although I was very slow I would still get things done..
so now that I don't have like..
"any authoritative figure (parent) looming over me all the time, its harder to get things done efficiently and without meds I just rot in bed all day"
I guess its kinda like body doubling.
Fortunate to have a partner who cares for me and a therapist who also has adhd lol
"Sometimes things still just feel overwhelming, so thank you so much for your encouragement, it’s helpful on days like this."
"haha i am a male, but that doesn’t mean you’re wrong! also, magnesium has been helpful for sure, but still have to take trazedone to sleep through the night a lot"
also if youve watched jaidenanimations adhd video she said that she took so long to figure out that she had adhd bcuz she was able to function normally when she was a kid but it was bcuz her mom helped her stay organized

I can’t hear lyrics in music

no it won’t be worse 🙄 eye roll at your therapist
it will just *feel* worse because you’ve been functional for so long and now you’re not
unless she is a psychiatrist (doctor who prescribe meds) I would take her knowledge/opinions on medication with a grain of salt. 
"My psychiatrist put it like this: the meds are supposed to help you put coping mechanisms into action (like using a calendar, organization hacks, using a budget, etc)"
"They don't magically make everything better but they should help you develop those skills to the point where, if you choose to or need to come off meds, you have better developed ways to cope with ADHD"
"

Of course you'll feel somewhat worse after stopping a med"
Happens with almost all medications
Your brain will return to baseline eventually but this time you'll have some new tricks and skills to help you manage your ADHD unmedicated :)
"i used to take medication, and i stopped because of the side effects"
"you don't get worse after coming off it, it seems like it because of the withdrawal (kind of like how when you stop coffee after drinking everyday, you get headaches and other symptoms), eventually after sometime you go back to how you were"
it's honestly up to you if you want to try it.
A therapist who is anti-meds
"That’s a new one on me.
I mean, I get a therapist might be cautious about meds or not see them as a single approach, but anti … wow"
"Can’t see how that would work out for patients who really need meds.
Anyway! What other people say on here is what I have found"
"I sometimes take a day off meds and it’s wild how aware I am of how  much ADHD influences every part of my life… no new things, the same things, but in stark contrast to how I function in my usual medicated daily life"
"It’s good to experience that because to me while I am taking them, the effects seem so subtle"
"It’s when I am not taking them, I realise they are really doing some good things for me."
There is a level of self awareness we struggle with some times that can make the meds seem weird
"When I’ve taken stimulants to get through the day, and they wear off when I get home"
"My ADHD isn’t getting worse, it’s just that I’ve had a more productive day than I’m historically used too, and the crash can make your symptoms more pronounced as you return to normal"
"

Make your symptoms worse over time?  Highly unlikely and not supported basically anywhere"
"Conceptually it is more likely with time, if you aren’t building up strong behavioral skills that when you go off medication, or they stop working as well, then a return to symptoms might seem worse than before"
"That does not mean it is worse, if that makes sense? There are some people writing about how different times in our lives make our symptoms better or worse but not much at all about meds making it worse with time"
"

Your therapist should focus on helping you adjust to this mindfulness, taking stimulants and having them actually work effectively and consistently, is way more work than anyone’s going to warn you about 🤣it’s like putting the most irritating puzzle of your life together until you get it right"
Then you miss bedtime by and hour and are suddenly stuck wondering how you never noticed this kind of effect before.
This was my initial view on it
Thank you!
Also had one
"He was generally very good and competent, so I value his opinion quite much and needed some time to emancipate myself from it a bit"
"But yeah, his stance on it is that meds are often taken as a red herring, to avoid tackling the emotional issues and that they can hinder the therapy‘s success somewhat"
This guy had decades of experience mind you
"I was skeptical in the beginning, but after some time I got his point and I think it often applies"
I just wouldn’t agree that it *always* tackling the issues
In some cases it enables tackling them. 
I understand that viewpoint
It’s so important to know WHEN meds might help
My psychiatrist is very holistic
"I am late diagnosed, a yoga and meditation teacher, a trained counsellor… and have a good life"
"He saw that I had so many good strategies in place to work with my brain and its neurobiology, but that I was often feeling the effects of so much effort, you know? 

Periods of productivity and motivation followed by periods of shut down and burnout, sensory issues I managed by not socialising like I once had… having constantly to set boundaries that became a bit imprisoning for me over time and felt so restrictive.

I am 59, and I praise all my genuine attempts to support myself but there came a time when I had to admit I needed more help.

I didn’t know what meds would do for me"
But it felt worth trying and I am so glad I did
I have put so much effort into life
I am intelligent and self-motivated
I deserve to feel good and not constantly overwhelmed
"

He said to me, “it’s wonderful there are these medicines that can help people like you who are so motivated to help themselves"
"I am excited for you.” 

I felt lighter just hearing that"
I doubt the majority of people go to ADHD drugs as a fix because they don’t want to do other good things
I think they get to a point where they have to admit there is no shame in getting more help.
"Yes, I wholeheartedly agree"
I think ADHD is a different beast than depression (and of course even with depression there are cases where am immediate deep dive into the cause of the emotions is not the most helpful approach).

I usually have over 100 but hard to tell bc once you’re over 99 chrome just shows “:)”
427 tabs open in Safari
"And yes, I need them all"
They contain the history of my thoughts.
I'm hyper fixated in closing all the tabs before opening another.
"How many tabs? 


Yes."
"40? Try 900, rookie"
"876 standard tabs, says chrome"
"Three seperate browsers, all with around 20 to 30 a piece."
At the moment I only have about 5 open
A few weeks back I had about 20 and my gf decided to close them all right in front of me and I genuinely almost had a panic attack
I'm like opposite to most folk
I refuse to have a ton of tabs
"When I did my research I needed SOOO many open, I finally just fucking labelled my folders suuuuuper specifically so I could find them quickly"
I legit prefer nor more than 3 tabs or it overwhelms me
Even when I'm doing research
"I have a folder called ""mathematical modelling - non HER2 oncolytic therapy (week-long dates of folder).

Of course this means I have sub folders inside of sub folders inside of sub folders.

But hot damn can I find shit."
lmao i have 403 tabs open on my phone
fun fact: safari limits tabs to 1000
"500 in private browsing, and 500 in standard safari"
"i’ve hit that 500 pb mark *multiple times.* 

(i don’t like my browsing/search history being constantly full of random nonsense like “population of the usa” or my rabbit hole of imdb pages"
so i primarily use private browsing mode)
Top of three
The autism side of the AuDHD can't handle it otherwise.
40? pfft rookie numbers
i have like 600 👍🏻
I actually get super anxious when I have too many tabs open
So usually no more than 5 to 7 tabs
"500 on Safari & 71 on google chrome 

Maybe I need to increase my meds…

Edit: oh god I didn’t even count all the “inactive” chrome tabs"
477 💀💀
*cough * okay I actually counted them up and ..
553
I'll see myself out
🙃
I have 314 tabs open on my phone
Three hundred and fourteen
After a clean up its usually closer to a hundred
And there’s nothing wrong with that
At work it’s closer to 20 since they close when it gets powered off
There’s nothing wrong about leaving tabs open
We need to see things to remember they exist.
"Only 37 rn.🤯

Normally around 80 & I don‘t care😂"
"Not quite that bad but just recently heard the term ""Tab hoarder"" might want to keep it handy"
40? beginner
i have minimum 60 and often :D because it's more than 100
57
757
I never have more than 5
I close all tabs when I am done looking up whatever I need to.
I have all 500 tabs open 😭
307
That’s just in my main browser
I have >20 tab groups with an estimation of ~10 tabs per group
It’s probably higher than 10 though.
All of ‘em
Every
Single
Time.
I reached the limit on Safari on my phone recently (500)
"My phone browser says «  ♾️ » 
So too much tabs to be count 😅"
193 😭 all my hyper fixations live here
I have been stuck with 500 tabs open for years and that’s just because that’s the limit on safari
I suffer every time I have to open new tabs because that means I have to choose which to close haha
980-ish across two devices is my record
"Current oldest tab is from 2018, but I swear, I’m really going to need that someday"
😬
"I had over 300 tabs on my phone, i keep them all cause when i realize i forgot something i wanted or wtv i have to go back to what i was doing in the moment i thought of it to remeber"
"319 tabs, 15,540 emails, 402 missed calls and voicemails, 235 missed texts and 2 missed software updates"
"

And a partridge in a pear tree 😩❤️💚"
"
I’ve had like 40 something and I still have over 400,000 emails and my inbox because at this point I’m not gonna go through and delete and all that crap"
"1123 🥲
I was down to 10 a while ago, but it takes really long to close them because all of them have interesting info I need to read again!"
Between all devices and browsers probably 500+.
"Apple’s Safari profile, cloud tabs, and most importantly, silicon and other latest chips so I can just pull the “read later” clutter together in one window and be minimize it on Mac or iPad"
And no slow downs
"On iPhone, I just let them die: tabs have an expiration date"
"And the tabs I opened in one Safari profile, do not show on the other"
"

In short, I can open how many I want, the clutter sorts itself when I need it to."
"Computer: no idea
Phone: 375"
504 I honestly thought I had managed to close most of them
😕🤔
"200 on one browser, 346 on the other"
Nah you’re good I just checked and I have 164 (just on my phone)
Roughly 500.
Just checked and I have 166
It’s not even that bad for me
Normally just like 5 but when it comes to something important like work or school like 14-20
I tend to have anywhere between 50 and 150 tabs open in my phone browsers (I have many different browsers which is an issue of its own)
My laptop doesn't tend to get overfilled with tabs.
that depends
"i have an ipad, laptop, and phone"
"in total, i probably have over 1,000 tabs open across my devices  (including different browsers lol)"
"Split between the two monitors in front of me, 28"
"13 of those are researching something I have an idea for, the rest are tabs that are normally open."
98
My phone tops out at 500 tabs? Guess how I know this..?? Yup
"At it currently and have been for ages… despite several attempts at purging.

My computer I’ve been more successful at maintaining, but I still have several dozen open at any one time across three windows (Personal, Work, D&D)"
"A few months ago I had over 250 I think, so that’s definitely an improvement."
"Eh, enough that it shows a :D

And that's just on my phone"
"Not any of my old tablets, or my laptop, or my old phone"
"

In the group of tabs on my phone I'm currently using, though? 27"
Much lower than normal
"I had +99 tabs of extremely different subjects, or the same one opened +3 times lol"
"but i closed them all the other day except for 4 for some reason, because “I might need them”."
71 tabs open on chrome
"I have about 9 groups with over 100 tabs each 
The groups helped organize the content it was not effective in tab creation"
"On desktop: 2 browser instances with their own account logged in, about 10 tabs on one, 30-45 on the other"
"
On my phone: :)"
82
I usually clean it once it reaches 100.
Try 99 and they just delete the oldest one to open a new one lol
"925 according to the ""are you sure you want to close"" message"
386 😞
1 on my pc
20 on my phone
"I'm decently good at managing tabs on my phone...

My laptop though? If I have less than 100 tabs open, something's crashed, because I did not close them..."
I usually have about 100 browser tabs open
Is it an adhd thing?
"I’m the opposite, I can’t handle having many tabs open and it just makes me uncomfortable"
"I’m talking like three to four tabs at max, given that I would have video playing in one of them."
10
"I'm doing really good at the moment.

My very calm, definitely not ADHD, revoltingly well organized little Chinese wife has so many chrome tabs open it just shows "":D"" instead of a number, which means it's >100 so who really knows.

I assume her mobile chrome tabs are a coping mechanism for having to deal with a husband and 2 small children whom all have adhd"
I have about 90 tabs open on my iPhone and I am trying to reduce the number
Rookie numbers
"My phone just told me off for having 500 tabs open, and apparantly i need to close a few to be able to open more 🥲"
"Those aren't tabs, they're visual bookmarks"
People are allowed unlimited bookmarks
"My browser camt even count them anymore, so it clearly agrees!"
"On my work computer I have like four or five windows open, each with between 20 and 50+ tabs"
I haven't counted lately
Should probably close them all since their importance is all in my head and I haven't checked at least two of the windows for months
"


Thank you for the reminder"
I'll sort through my tabs today and close those that don't matter
"Might drop back in with more accurate numbers when I'm done.



Edit: 


6 windows open"
"


86 tabs open in total"
"


Not as bad as it has been other times."
40 is rookie numbers 😆
183 at this moment 
I’ve had like 460 before idk how it happens
"I can't stand a big amount of tabs open, which results in me closing tabs I actually still need.."
" 
Right now there are 8 open, which is an unusual amount, but it's for school research..."
"7,771."
My phone has near 700 of things I want to read....
eventually
"How many tabs open?

All of them! Lost the count"
"Every now and then, I'll go on a (tabs) killing spree and close many of them, but then again..."
🤣
I’m the opposite I hate to have lots of tabs open I usually have 3 max
"Even on phone I close all the apps i’m not using in the exact moment

edit: closed reddit right after I made this comment and opened it 5min after"
Oh no
"Having too many tabs open at once makes me uncomfortable!

Someone showed me something on their phone the once and they had about 50 tabs open and I was like  noooooooo,  why would you do that 😅😂"
I have all my browsers set to close tabs that have been inactive for 24hrs
It's a literal gamechanger for me
Worst I've had was 724 forgotten tabs on my phone.
75 in Google
I get anxious with anything over 5 and immediately close them down to 1
Can’t have more than 7 on laptop without it crashing
Recently deleted 300 Safari Tabs
I now have 30 tabs on Safari open.
"I feel productive with too many open, have to be multitasking, makes life feel fuller, you know.."
*shrug*
I have the max on Safari
"If I need to open a new one, I have to close one first."
I’m too stressed out with too many computer tabs open but my phone i have 150+
"I’m a control freak (kinda) when it comes to random stuff like this and have to clean up my stuff, never more than a handful of tabs"
"But then, recently my new, very nice, pc I just got this Jan, has been struggling with more than a few tabs open at once and heavens forbid I have any other applications open at the same time as chrome! It doesn’t chug/lag, the pc just stops responding and crashes everything as if it’s out of memory.

Sorry, very random off topic rant"
"I do understand this experience, I don’t do the same thing but I have my own things that are the same result and it was spooky once to realize the rabbit hole I had going on"
Each one is important!
My peak was 360s
I have brought it down to 140
 Now creeping back up to 200
"Wow, I thought I was bad at around 20 regularly"
I'll _eventually_ get to that Atlantic article (not) 😂
"Currently, 'over 99'"
My Android just shows :D after that.
I mentally shut down when i have too many tabs and close everything and start over
Happens a few times a week.
500 on my laptop at one point
Phone browsers stop showing the number after 99 and I have 3 different phone browsers… so 40 is fine
If it’s slowing down your phone at 40 then I guess it’s time to lean into making bookmarks.
32 on a private browser and 498 on the not private one 🥴
"30 ish in my PC, 100+ on Google chrome in my phone and 80 on my Opera in my phone too, different browsers for different things"
"Those are rookie numbers, I have 3 browsers with 100 each, and my both phones (personal and work) with the "":D"" since 2022 that I never stopped adding..."
78
I really need to close them..
Maybe tomorrow.
"Currently, 70"
"Drives my husband insane, even though I'm pretty sure he has undiagnosed ADHD"
"Funny thing is, I'm the organized one and he is a disaster with organization"
"But he absolutely cannot handle tabs open, desktop icons, or any events marked on his calendar."
"You mean my 753 tabs?
Don't mind then - they're just my emotional support tabs."
I closed 1600 open tabs on my phone in June/July
"A few days ago I checked and I already had about 800.
😁"
Your phone shouldn't slow down regardless of the number of tabs open
They get unloaded if not used for a while and reloaded when you try to open an old one.
Firefox has a setting that closes a tab after something like 2-4 weeks of inactivity
So now I have more like 20 open instead of :D
Probably around 800 but i don't really have time to count Them completly.
Just closed 468 Safari tabs on my iPhone after I finally realised how slow it was… 🙈
More than 99 and my phone now says :D instead of the number of tabs in the top right corner.
Over 500
"I tend to open new tabs when shopping so I don’t lose my spot when browsing, and I do the same when researching for my job (accessories designer)"
I’ll often forget to go back and close them out because I quickly move onto the next thing.
"I used to have a lot of tabs open at once, but nowadays I get kinda overwhelmed by them so I try to keep it to the essentials (a youtube video"
"That's ""the essentials"")."
I often find myself with over 100
I just mass delete all when chrome gives me the smiley face.
"Mine usually stacks up over 100 over 6 months, and then Safari crashes and makes me start over :) this has happened atleast 4 times"
219 right now
Thanks for the reminder lol
Roughly 400 across all devices and browsers (after cleaning them up)..
plus an ungodly amount of bookmarks.
"15 on my laptop, I think I have like 23 on my PC (we don't talk about the favorites tab)"
I had 28 open the other day
"If i keep them all open, though, Google runs slower, so I have to close them all"
Just checked
56 😬
I keep hitting the limit for safari on my phone which is 500 so I currently have 495
"Yes, I refer to them often and I “need” them all."
"On my work desktop:

My business workflow has about 85 tabs open"
"But I use many of them often, so it's way better than bookmarks.

My personal browser has about 40 tabs open."
I have about 600-700 tabs open among 3 devices
☹️ I keep telling myself I’ll go through them but I stop after a couple dozen
I don’t want to close them because I fear I’ll miss something I need
😭 
"On which device?

On my cell phone, 85 tabs"
"On my work PC, 2 windows with 5 tabs each"
Home PC probably another 15.
408 currently…
"About 25 at the moment, and that’s a real improvement only because my kids razz me all the time about this.

But yeah, I don’t want to forget which hotel I was looking at for going to visit family this Christmas, or which new author I wanted to maybe read, or which of the seven pumpkin pie recipes to try…"
I'm back up to 71.
Feck knows how many tabs are open
"So many there's viruses popping up all over the place now aswell, so I seem to have no chance lol.

Ps, take meds"
How nice that they have tab groupings now
"495, and only because I finally closed a few."
Thanks for the reminder
 I went down from 34 to 21
 Whew!
"This is the topic of my life lol

Once I got an IT remote assistant and he saw all my tabs (20+) and, after getting lost many times, he suggested that closing my tabs would also make my laptop faster"
"
I said right away ""man, I need those to organize my life"".
We laughed - and I didn't close any"
🤓
73 lol
about 60-80
For each of the 2 browsers I use
Oh I can’t have more than 1 or 2 tabs open 😂 it makes me nervous when I have too many open tabs
""":)"" + now that I can also group them.."
Basically infinity
I have had 20-30
"150-170

I got tired of counting"
On my PC I have about 20 or so tabs open
"So not too bad...

My phone on the other hand.."
"I think I have over 200 at the moment, my phone gave up on keeping track."
I just have a :D in a box where it shows the tab number....what does this mean?
227
87 🫠
On my phone i currently have 92 tabs open on the internet
So dont feel bad
Mainly browse internet on my phone but currently have 27 tabs open
I used to have hundreds at a time but I set my safari settings to auto delete tabs after 1 week so now I don’t have to worry about it
As for the tabs on the phone itself… idk I never close those and it also doesn’t really tell you how many are open
Occasionally I’ll feel lag on the phone and close them but don’t do it regularly
Apple really needs a “close all apps” setting tbh
Pixel had one and it’s a feature I miss.
"I weep for the tech support folk in all of your lives.

It could be me..."
"Chrome, between two windows I have about 660, at last check"
"I close a lot, but then open a lot.

I can't get rid of them"
"If I bookmark them I'll never look at them again, whereas now I can scroll through the and look at all my hopes and dreams and projects that I've never actually begun along with all the items I need to begin them.

The windows started out being segregated.."
Work/education related and like personal/home projects/leisure
"At some point that went out the window.

And now that you seemingly can't have different tabs logged in to Google stuff with different accounts, I need a third window just so I don't get ads on YouTube and YT Music"
" There's now way this ends well, right?"
Can't count
"I also use 2-3 différent browser at the same time, and often use two computers XD

But in a regular day i would say 60 Tab in my main browser in my main computers"
"I'm anxious to Not find things ( ironically, i can't find things amongst all these Tabs)"
"On the phone I'm trying to keep around 30-55.

On PC I'm trying to never be above 80.

My record is 240."
473 on safari
Currently only 73 😅
500
That is what tabs are for 😂😂😂 I’ve got 43 at the moment on my phone
Computer? 11 max
Phone? 938293729937390183902 tabs.
I have 158 on safari rn
All of them
"I use 2 browsers that both save my tabs if i close them so I can keep all my tabs open and just close it and use the other one for videos and such.

Also upgraded my RAM to 64GB (way more than needed) to handle it all."
It says 1897 inactive tabs.
Eventually what I did was go to my settings and have it close the tabs for me after a month
It leads to a lot of researching (excuse the pun haha) but I’m getting used to it!
Keep it 99
I keep mine fairly under control
 There's only around 60 open in chrome on my phone at any given time.
50
if I don’t remember what they are after a certain point I just close them ALL
 they really can’t be that important if idek why they’re open … and I can’t possibly wait for each tab to reload at a glacial pace slowly it was in energy-saving mode 🤣
"174 and several more in private browsing, none of which are even sensitive or ""private"" content"
My iPhone will offer to close down old ones when I reach 500
Very helpful.
Too many to count.
Around 140
I thought 100 tabs open was normal 😬
: D
4… and I’m not proud of it
Smiley face or you ain't doing it hard enough
I usually have 3-4 windows (are they still called that?) open at a time with about 20-25 open tabs each.
495.
😭
Max 3 or 4
"The more I have open, the more I get distracted, and the less I get done"
Havinf too many  tabs open is like having a cluttered house.
beware if you just keep them there and never open em it's just digital hoarding disorder
"I use The Marvelous Suspender to suspend tabs to conserve ram on my PC, with 32gb of ram"
I feel like my tabs are organized atm but I have at least 200 open
"That's better than what it was last month when I had to go through them and closed about ~3,000"
"Even though I don't use 99% of those tabs, they're things I want to go back to at some point."
lol.
"I have 4 instances of Google Chrome opened with 20-30 tabs opem in each.

But sometimes my computer restart by itself 🤬 
So I have to reopen the tabs and save then in a bookmarks folder.
Then I forget to check again this bookmarks folder...
So now I have 1000 of tabs in various random bookmarks folder lol"
Just checked my phone browser
497 open + 4 in incognito.
I don’t even want to check mine right now
But I do have 160 unopened texts and over a hundred voicemails I’ve not acknowledged.
"I have like 400-600 on laptop, and on both phones 99+ (because of smiley face)"
"I have a problem, Im aware"
"10 on my phone, 8 at work and like..."
20 at my home PC x'D
Here's the big question
"How many of you kept that tab open to make that recipe that you saw a 6 months ago, and now you can't find that tab, and even when you search it you can't find the same recipe"
"2,180"
"400

My kids went wild 

Thank goodness for the close all function "
Please congratulate me reddit! Today I installed 'Instapaper' and moved all 500 of my tabs into bookmarks in Instapaper
"Now I have a nice clean 40 tabs open and my browser has stopped crashing with ""not enough memory"" errors"
 I hope I can keep it down to under 40 tabs for more than a few days
"

Feeling accomplished."
"My work computer has about 50 open, most are images in a new tab"
I’m designing a few things and it’s more organized there than on my desktop
Or so I tell myself.
I have many but they are grouped/categorized so I don’t see them all at once
"🥲

Work: 2 tabs, manage this closely
Personal: 29 tabs, this is where ideas and questions go to die—I mean, “come back to eventually”
Volunteer role 1: 5 tabs
Volunteer role 2: 9 tabs

Phone: keeps 39 tabs of its own, DANG IT why did I look 🫠"
3705
I start closing when I can't read the titles
"
On my phone I just close every week or 2....or month."
761...
🥴
"249

I fully realize I have a problem lol"
"On which browser? I have 4 browsers on my laptop, 3 on my phone."
I often have 40+ tabs open on my _mobile_ browser
35 internet tabs and 12+ apps..
thanks for the reminder to close some stuff
452
Those feel like rookie numbers 😂
can't operate with more than like 5 at a time bc I need to switch between them
"if I need a bunch of quick reference pages, I'll open them as a new browser window with its own set of tabs"
I think I've had around 20-40 tabs open at once but then closed some when my computer started to sound like a jet engine.
I’m at 150
i thought i was doing alright with 72 tabs in safari and 12 tabs in chrome but i checked the “inactive tabs” on chrome and turns out there’s 175 more unopened tabs there 😭
Currently 58
"Sometimes I go through and screenshot the ""thing"" and close the tab"
I then never go back to the screenshot
I've found this has gotten worse for me as I get older 💀
25
"In one window? Or all windows on all devices…,"
"On my phone? 25, most of them I don't even need it any more"
" On my tablet?  I don't know, didn't count"
 Let's just say a few
In total around 4000 across several devices
And no that’s not an exaggeration lol
I need to start closing some for sure.
"0

I get anxiety about open tabs"
I only leave a tab open if I need to absolutely remember it because I will forget
"I always forget.

Oh and I clear my history regularly"
I hyper fixate
If I have multiple tabs open I would keep thinking about it
It's a whole issue
🤦‍♀️
"In order to keep my multiple tabs to a minimum, I like to add mine to my reading list where I will promptly forget about it"
Then I will repeat that a month later with the exact same pages.
"Thankfully, google chrome app has an inactive tab section for this very thing 🙏"
51 on PC
Mostly youtube videos..
I have 164 tabs open
My computer: Never more than like 10
"

My phone.."
did you know incognito counts as additional tabs besides the 500 on regular browsing?
I'm a tab closer
I don't understand people who have hundrets of tabs open contantly (do you know what bookmarks are?)
"But I do constantly have to do ""tab checks"" where I close most of them"
"Especially when I'm researching, or something, basically ""in the zone"" and finish some task - i look up and there are 20 tabs"
Then I close like 19 of those
I keep mine under 10 ish during normal use
"While modding/coding, it has no limit, but i do try to keep the tab names at least visible"
"I hate not being able to see which is which, lol"
My phone usually I start deleting after about 150 - I feel no shame about this as it’s on the go everyday research that I need to look up
0 Tabs are open I immediately close out the Browser once It is no longer useful.
"On my phone: 56 on Safari and on google chrome 35 and then another 99+ “inactive tabs” 

On my computer: like 5 windows of 15 probably"
"Over 100 on average, but I use a tab memory suspender so it doesn't eat my ram unless I actually browse it 😅"
86 ish
500 on my phone
"Oh wait, I learned that you can group tabs into a tab group (“recipes”, “Long Covid”) and that takes them out of the 500 max queue"
So 498 plus however many in all the tab groups.
Currently sitting at 58
I have 382
Yikes
I usually go through every couple months and get rid of the ones I feel I don’t need
Realistically though I could get rid of more.
19 tabs atm
"Sadly 16 are nsfw that have been in the background for months.

Also have about 400 saved reddit posts that I haven't went back to"
"My brain kinda counts those as open tabs lmao

6 project cars im working on atm"
Also building a fence and painting my bathroom and remodeling a camper.
"trying to organize my tools he'd while Rebuilding an atv and working on 2 others.

Then my dad passed in June"
"So still trying to deal with his estate.

He was like me with lots of projects"
"So coming into 2 more trucks that are half built along with a house with 25 years of family history stored in the attic

Somehow I don't know how my brain handles it all"
"

I try to get rid of or finish projects"
But i scrap one half finished project Then suddenly I have 2 more..
"Maybe 4 or 5 because i realize I do like to irrationally keep them open,  but never actually parse them out"
"So, I'm just dogging my device for no practical gain.

Now my email? I don't delete any of that."
"It’s a bit more nuanced than “40” tabs.
On computer, I’ll be running 2 or 3 browser windows with up to a dozen or so tabs depending on what tangents I’m going down: one window cameras & YouTube; one window training / work / research; one window for silly random browsing… but sometimes I minimise a window “tangent” for a good while and forget about it for a week or month… Oh hello, old friend…

Oh my phone however, well, I have an ENDLESS scroll of safari tabs for the last however many years… somehow it does not crash the app"
Takes me 10 seconds to hyper-scroll from top to bottom.
100s on both safari and google
Only about 20ish on my computer lol.
I never go above 5
Stresses me out
500 that I finally chose to clear today because I could not open anymore
Rookie numbers LOL
But u just might need the recall to the home DIY project you wanted to start 2 years ago and it’s a perfect set of plans and punch list…
On my laptop I get annoyed with how many tabs I have open so instead of closing them I open a whole new window and start stackin up another set of tabs
There's 17 windows right now that each have probably like 20 or 30 tabs that I will never look at again lolol 🥲
A bit over 400 on my phone
I have so many open it doesn't even show me how many I have open anymore 😂
Not sure I've been at :) for forever
Currently on 789 open tabs on Chrome Mobile
"And most of them are organized in groups (yes, with names and some subgroups😆)"
Around 600😭
"I started closing mine because my stbx would ask ""how many tabs ya got open"" like he really got me."
I don't know but at one point when I used to have apple phones I had over 100k unread emails 🤣
192
My biggest tab clean up was 184
"I get extremely annoyed If I can’t read what each individual tab is so not many.

But don’t ask me how many desktop icons I have."
"i get too focused on keeping one open at a time, 4-5 max if i’m needing all them for one task"
80
Only 40
That’s between two apps on my phone and my laptop tho
Brave browser has a setting to close old tabs
I have mine set to auto close tabs that are 1 week old.
"97, I like to save sweepstakes I want to enter on different tabs."
I have this browser extension that shows a list of all closed tabs to easily go back to them
"Since then, I only have like 5-8 tabs open at a time."
208 😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫
"251 - I’m kinda proud of myself 😂 well that’s my main tab folder anyway, plenty of others"
498 on safari right now
I keep hitting the 500 tabs open… and it’s asking if I want to close them all
I almost have an anxiety attack every time it asks
I had close to 70 on my iPhone but I had to clean up my cache so I bookmarked what I really needed to keep and trashed the rest
Clean slate!
"Right now? 33 on Chrome, 30 on DuckDuckGo, 65 on Wikipedia..."
40 tabs? those are rookie numbers! on my phone I am usually running between 300 - 500 tabs
"Chrome crashes all the time and my phone struggles now and then too, LoL!"
I constantly hit the 500 max on my phone
My computer tabs are a mess
"I’ve hit almost the 5,000 limit on YouTube watch later (essentially all tabs). 

Also, highly recommend the podcast 500 open tabs"
Two artists who are friends and (clearly) have adhd picking a tab to tell each other about
"Very obscure topics, incredible banter, it’s been my favourite thing this last year. "
"I have more than 10000 on firefox on main PC with thousands open on edge, chrome, brave and Vivaldi too, I basically change browser when it becomes ""unwieldable"""
"Thousands also opened on my laptop, 30+ windows of tabs"
More than 10000 open on chrome on my phone
"I know because I used an adb command to export them, thousands on kiwi.."
I have dozens of old files containing backups of old tabs across time
"I basically never close a tab because I go from one thing to another without stopping and fall in the fallacy of ""I will have time later to get back to this"""
"It's sadly not a joke (can easily show proof of tab counters and json data), it's just hell to the point when external people see the state of my laptop and joke ""what would you do if I closed everything, would you feel better?"" I don't take it lightly.
Honestly, reading ""I have 40 tabs open my phone is so slow"" sounds like someone that is ""so ADHD"" trying to relate"
"Also there is no way 40 tabs slows down any modern phone on any modern system, tabs are unloaded from memory when not in use"
Learning about placing tabs into categorized groups so you can have more open while still keeping them readable has both saved me and destroyed me lol
0
Firefox focus
"Only three!

My email, a recipe from.the last time I used my computer, and a blank tab

I'm usually good about tabs."
Like 200 total probably
I currently have 68 on my phone which is pretty standard
I would bet that at least 20 are duplicates of the same websites I visit often lol
My laptop has started freezing when I get too many.
"I got about 140 open at the moment, I might have to purge whatever isn’t important tomorrow."
"Nah I have it under control, I just cleaned up my browser…and it’s 35 tabs."
In which browser? On what device? Combined thousands
Sitting at 33 right now lol
"YOOOOO 169 tabs on my phone and only 20 on my Mac 😚  thank you for making this thread I feel justified!

Lmao it’s also like the way I never actually go back to them for me 😭 
 I totally surprise myself by the stuff I still have saved “cause I’ll need to remember this” from a year or two ago"
My tabs have tabs 🤔 🧮
80 on my phone
"Cleared mine today, but thanks lol 😆😁"
Multiple hundreds
"On my phone I have several tab groups for more specific ranges of topics, and they ALL have 100-250 at any given time. "
"My chrome tab count has been :D for months now , if u know u know XD"
About twice a year I have to close all tabs because they reached max number of 500
Phone tabs or computer tabs lol
299
Not too bad but if my kids saw this they would shame and disown me lol
Click the face
Click the dots
Click the select tabs
"Select all.

I have 947 tabs open."
I learned that for myself just the other day
😂 Down to 93 atm.
I'm over 100 also
"It's :D for me, which is cute and threatening."
This the benchmark
That :) taunts me every two weeks....
"Mine does :D

Both my phone, and tablet say :D right now"
I call that the infinity number
Me too
I use Brave (looking for a different one) And I had over 200 the other day
I can only see one column plus another with a tab search.
Oh yeah! Same here.
"329 over here… everyone’s saying like 5-10 and I’m just like listen, that scalloped potato recipe I opened in march 2022 isn’t going to make itself"
Priorities people.
"Currently 488 on my phone, inching ever closer to that 500 tab limit"
Every now and then I’ll spend an afternoon pruning it down a couple hundred to give myself more room.
"Dude you can just type notes of the main theme/point of the idea,,, you will have way way less points than 427…"
"And, then you can open the notes and select subject you want to dive into."
Haven’t felt so related to a comment in a long time lmao
"Now I don't feel so bad, always way over 100, 200+ the other day"
"To remind myself, but I also am bad at closing the ones I'm done with, as well as deleting emails."
use bookmarks
"THIS IS EXACTLY WHY I KEEP IT!!! When i forget something i need to check either my amazon, safari, tiktok, ect inorder to remeber what i was thinking of in that moment"
I just deleted all my history tho so im screwed
"Same, I usually only have 1-2 open at a time because it’s overwhelming to have any more than that."
Same here
I can't get tabs more than the amount to fill the tab space and get smaller
"same! it hurts me to also have notifications in apps, reddit is currently bugging me with a broken '1' on my notification bell"
Same
It also goes with apps open on my phone
I have to keep it down to just the ones I'm using at that exact moment.
"I was over 1,000 the other day"
Down to 753 after cleaning up a whole bunch of them.
I don’t even consider closing some until it exceeds 500
Why bother?
"Same except same browser and several ""new windows"" keeps my thoughts a bit better organized"
And my husband doesn't realize how many I actually have open because he has caught onto the new wi down thing I just started doing.
"I lean this way too, I’ve got zero because I close every tab before I close the browser"
And I have some practical bookmarks folders
But the “other” folder is… colorful.
Agreed
I cannot relate at all to the people saying 100+
That just sounds stressful and..
"I dunno, pointless? Surely all that means is that they never close their tabs? Who the heck is gonna go back to a tab when you have that many?

On my work machine (where I have the most tabs open, since my work these days uses cloud tools for pretty much everything), I have some pinned tabs for my company chat, email, calendar, and my notes"
Then I'll usually have up to 5 tabs for tickets I'm working on or will be working on (usually only one or two for things I'm not actively working on)
"When I'm actively looking through code, I might have up to 5 more tabs for that"
"I'll compulsively close tabs when I don't need them anymore, as otherwise I can't find shit"
"If I need to go back to a closed tab, a search from history is easy peasy"
"If I have to context switch, then I might make tab groups and I'll collapse the group I'm not currently working on.

I'll often move a few tabs to other windows to focus on just that task (and also to just better make use of multiple monitors)"
Those second windows are constantly being closed
Or might be literally just my IDE or whatever code reviews I'm doing
Sometimes I'll just open a tab for every code review I need to do and I love to see the tab count go down
"It's like a progress bar for when I'm done (I love doing code reviews, but I often have a lot of them and they're fairly time intensive).

Overall? Excluding the 4 perma pinned tabs, I usually have between 2-5 tabs, typically split across 2 windows"
"At most, maybe 20 when really deep in the weeds (and that's a bad state that I want to get out of)."
"I think they uncapped it somewhat recently, I’ve had the number surpass 500 slightly"
You can actually have a lot more than 1000 tabs in Safari
I don’t think there’s even a limit
You can create new tab groups and have multiple at a time with each one allowing 500 tabs in the tab group
At one point I’ve had over 3000 tabs open on Safari.
My kind of people
Same!
"Same, or save it to my favorites and then completely forget it’s there until a few months later"
Oof
"I created a new email account when it got over 10,000 unread emails."
Yeah I have over 100 on my phone.
[screenshot of tab count](https://imgur.com/a/tsdqCni)
This 🙌 is why I caught myself at just 40 😂 I have resets too kind of like a task paralysis situation
I can't think without the reset
I like to say my brain turns to scrambled eggs 😆
"Nevermind, my medication has kicked in"
Time to organise my phone and life
"I'm not sure why closing them out helps
my phone gets unstuck."
"😩 Dreading cleaning out the favorites tab, too."
Something I had my husband do for him (he is autistic) to understand more about how my brain works is go through from start to finish and ask me about the tabs (400 would be a lot) but he was quickly able to see how my brain jumps all around lol
I think it means a lot 😄 (over 99)
No ending well in sight 🫂
I used to favor android until I read this comment.
Well I checked
25.
I knew it would be so bad because I purge those every so often.
That is definitely worth pats on the back 💯
The death of ideas and questions category 😆 love it!
You're not alone 😩😆
It's cellular memory problems really
I can't handle the slow processing and do need my resets 😂
Number of tabs per window of each window 😳
Master Masker 🏆 It just feels right ❤️
Computer is another issue - if I’m actively sitting down to research something - easily 50 tabs open as it’s easier to research that way
I don’t like going back to my googled page - I like a new tab per clickable Google link
I'm sorry for your loss 😔 I know about having a Dad pass
It really is a lot
I'm proud of you for all the ways you cope with these changes! It's hard
I hope you finish a few that really make you feel accomplished.
"Tell them, ""not enough."" 😁"
You have 1 right now 😉
136 for me (I got a new I phone this month)
"1957 baby!


Edit - 1954, forgot the number I checked literally 30 seconds ago."
695 😂
"My mom had no idea that tabs exist on her phone and she was trying to show me something, I found she had almost 1000 and I was honestly amazed LOL"
"959, in Chrome"
Do you know if that includes tabs opened in groups? Because I have a bunch of those too
LOL
Not even going to check how many I have opened in Firefox rn
XD
"Oh shit I have 878 open , it only feels like a couple are open what "
"1723 tabs, most of them have nested tab groups opened inside"
"   
    
I finally understand now why my phone is so slow."
Aw that’s almost a goal now lol
"Same, and I will chrome is laughing at me for having too many"
"309 for me, and same, it’s the damn recipes that really get me.

Edit: I forgot about duck duck go, I actually have 400"
"That’s just my phone, I have at least 20 on my computer as well 🫣"
This made me laugh because it's so relatable.
why don't you bookmark it then :0 (genuine)
This reminds me of the novel I started reading 13 years ago and keep telling myself I’m going to finish
"Every time I’ve opened it I’ve had to re-read what I previously read because I’ve forgotten what happened, so basically I’ve read the same 10 pages about 3 times in 13 years"
That’s how I read books
"For reference, I’m not yet medicated"
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|feels_good_man)
😂 yesss it’s always the recipes that get me
I am devastated by the loss of my baller ass shepherds pie recipe that I had in a tab for like 6 years and I got a new phone a couple years ago and lost it 😭😭
"To be fair, I don’t think many people here are saying 5-10  hehe"
I am reading everyone’s responses and I’m like these are my people!! And I’m trying to explain it to my husband and now we are arguing 🤦🏼‍♀️
"Put old ones into tab groups by subject, you won’t have to worry about that one you need that was deleted."
498 here.
"I read the comments with the number this made me anxious! At work only the tabs I need, the only place I can do it is on my iPhone I am always in the range of less than 20 but generaly 5 to 10."
Every now and then I delete all of them
oh wow
"i knew the pb mode had a 500 limit and that standard did, but i didn’t realize that tab groups had separate limits"
that’s wild!
"Oh, if we're talking bookmarks and saved.."
I do have quite a few
"Most are school related, but I have 122 bookmarks"
"I have a folder titled ""stoof"" where I put the random ones."
Now that we've mentioned it 🙃
It closes out anything over 1 month old
 It’s wild how fast I get to 500
" iPhone is the only way do go with ADHD, imo."
On my phone? 180 and 68 (private)
"On my computer, 5 windows and 35 tabs between them"
BUT
I just closed a bunch a little while ago because my computer is mad at me
It’s normally 60 or so per window
I usually open my personal mailbox in one window and work in another and then try to separate projects by window but I never know what’s happening…
Does the app count as a tab? 😂
"Oh crap, I just realised I have 2 tabs open"
"Good start for such a young phone, way to go!!!"
"Personally, I don't really remember what I bookmark, but tabs are always open

Not that I visit them anyway"
"That only happens when my browser crashes in an unrecoverable manner, or when I get a new phone"
"
Although it feels so freeing, so I should do it more often."
“Stoof” that’s great 🤣
This is the answer 😂 if it’s in a tab there’s a *chance* I’ll happen to scroll by it and remember why I saved it
"

If it’s bookmarked it ceases to exist."

what happens when i get tested?

Highest recommended dose is 70mg/day
What you are doing is reckless and illegal
Fuck your exams
Your body is more important and you can always retake courses
You are damaging your body and you will regret it.
Take care
I was just taking up 30mg of Vyvanse but ended up with Psychosis
Lost 1.5 years of my life
Was hearing voices and was trying to kill myself for months without knowing it
I wish I had never taken Vyvanse
300mg Vyvanse is insane.
Whoever prescribed you 100mg a day as a starting dose needs to be in prison
That’s blatant malpractice and you should sue them for it
They could have gotten you killed.
Are those doctors dosing you that high or are you abusing it? Those dosages seem insane to me
be strong and tell your doctor or a loved one exactly what your doing
"this is self harm whether you realize it or not.

You can and will get better, but the first step is being honest and reaching out"
"The longer you keep this up, the harder it will be to give it up"
"

The only safe dose is the one your doctor prescribes"
"If you can’t go down even when you know it’s a problem, you have to seek professional help immediately."
If I was your doctor and you told me this I'd deem you ineligible for stimulants
This is addiction
"You are the reason so many medical professionals start patients on non-stimulants first.

You shouldn't even be on 100mg most likely, that's a dose that has to be specially prescribed and it doesn't seem like your doc did their due diligence to titrate you up to it.

I'm baffled you are allowed to be prescribed 6-9 MONTHS of 100mg daily"
That is extremely unusual.
You’ll stop by running out of  Vyvanse weeks before you can get a refill
You’ll be forced to sleep it off for anywhere from a week to ten days
By that I mean you’ll find yourself drowsy and lethargic
"If you can, just sleep and make sure you eat and hydrate"
It will pass
I once downed over 300mg of Adderall IR in 24 hours
At a certain point it just stopped doing anything
But it didn’t kill me
Just made me depressed for the following week as my body re-adjusted
As far as withdrawal symptoms go I’ll take that over Xanax withdrawal any day
Just as a point of comparison you can overcome this
"Just set aside time to sleep, eat, and hydrate."
I am thankful for all the advice and will talk to my provider
I'm already seeking help in therapy and trying but I'm struggling at this moment
Idk much about vyvanse but I did try it for a couple days and hated it
Ran to my psych real quick to get me back on my Adderall IR
300 mg sounds like an insane and not even medically beneficial dose
"I am surprised you are still alive taking that much, i can barely handle 40mg as a big male"
How much worse can it get? I'm already at the point of sleeplessness and distress atm
I don't know how it feels like to stop
Yeah… its not easy at this moment for sure
"Right now I really wish I never touched it, but I feel like I can't stop"
"Exam period right around the corner, and then I'm off for a month"
"Maybe its stupid of me, but it seems so close that its worth it"
"Nah, no way anybody did, unless he was taking this dose already with a diff doc or something but it would be bad still"
I was prescribed 100mg/day from the get-go
"Of course when it started to lose its effect, I'm at fault for increasing"
Now I feel like I can't stop
"It does sound like part of the problem is that OP’s doctor prescribed an unsafe dose to begin with, contributing to OP’s dependency and escalating use (abuse)."
Thank you
"Unfortunately, I won't run out in the short future"
I'm studying abroad and take with me 6-9 months' worth of supply
Atm I have around 3 months worth
"I'm dreading the depression as I'm already going to therapy, but I slept up really badly again"
Do you drive? What happens if you have an accident and there’s 250mg of vyvanse in your body? Or what happens if this induces psychosis? Would that be worth an exam score? Have you checked your blood pressure lately? Do you have a family history of heart disease? My point is that it can get a lot worse
Exam pressure is real—as are many other difficult things happening in the world right now
"

If you dont have an addictions, you need to step back and slow down no matter how counterintuitive that seems"
Take your prescribed dose
Regulate your sleep schedule
Find a way to regulate your emotions
Eat nutrient dense foods
Tell a friend out loud exactly what you’re afraid of
"

If you have an addiction—it needs to be treated clinically"
It’s okay to reach out for help.
"You might need to go for a detox, maybe even go to the ER if you don't have insurance"
That much of a daily dose could have serious health issues if you just back it down to your prescribed dose again
You are going to have a heart attack tbh
Stop
Now.
Mania and psychosis are also very real possibilities
"Stimulants can trigger a manic episode at much lower doses than you’re taking, including risk of hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia"
Lack of sleep is an additional potential trigger.
"Friend, it is not worth it"
You could lose your life
That’s a plain fact
These doses are off the charts
The symptoms you’ve reported here are extreme
You are talking to people who are daily users of this medication
All of us are telling you that you’re in danger
"Yes, you might get through your exams and recover"
But you are already on the brink of cardiac failure and/ or psychotic break
You might recover
You might not
The stakes are too high to keep this up
No exam is worth this level of risk
You are experiencing a medical emergency
Get treatment
You can finish school when your life is no longer endangered.
it was common practice in the 80s I think that they'd prescribe you recreational levels of stimulants to ADHD folks
My friend's uncle got dependency and started getting dangerously addicted since there were not that much regulations about it.
"«The Norwegian Medicinal Handbook for Healthcare Professionals states that the maintenance dose for regular methylphenidate tablets is 30–80 mg/day, but occasionally up to 100 mg/day.» - they do, and did."
You need to call your prescriber right away and let them know this is happening
You should never be increasing on your own — you are abusing your meds to be blunt and this is really dangerous for you and your health
Please seek help
I don’t understand how you got prescribed 100 mg as a starting dose? That’s well over the maximum recommended dose.
That is INSANE
"You shouldn’t exceed 70mg a day, this is severe malpractice and u need to contact someone about this."
"Ok, then you have a serious problem"
"Because what has saved me in the past while running through my month supply in ten days or two weeks,  is that I couldn’t get anymore until the next 30 day period"
And that more than anything has saved me from myself
You really need to talk to someone.
"I have run labs (2 weeks ago), and they were fine"
"I know that's sounds like defending, but I have been trying as well to take care of it"
Its just hard to end it.
Such as? Is that really a concern?
How much would ppl take recreationaly? When it's so common to have heart palpitaions and anxiety at our loe doses
"Maintenance, not atarting"
How dangerous?
"No, he couldn't have"
"But whatever he got prescribed, how does he have THAT MUCH of it to take 300mg a day or much more if he's taking it more then once, I'm on something diff but take x3 a day and that's a long release"
"And ppl in US have their meds disposed with exactly right amount every month I think, that is if they can even get them"
Unless he's buying them illigaly idk who prescribed him THAT much
Its the FDA recommend dose to start at 70 mg
"In Europe, it has been viewed differently and 135 mg a day is the max dose and viewed as the highest"
Already had that conversation with different psychiatrist
"Thank you, its just Alot of shame associated with it"
I'm happy this community exist
You need to get help
"Real help, not internet help."
I don’t understand the point of your post if you obviously don’t want to hear the truth
You already fell off the edge
Get some professional help
Now.
"Such as it's not even fucking known because there were no studies over the max recommended dose, that's why it's max recommended, nobody knows what will the effects be"
And even on this up to this dose there were many big side effects like sudden death lol
"if I remember correctly, 500 to 1000mg?"
"Look, I got diagnosed at 22 (2 years ago)"
My psychiatrist who I shouldn’t have trusted in the grand scheme of things say work up your dosage to 100mg a day in a two months period
That’s what I did
I was good until this past summer
Did not over take or misuse
At one point it got too much and i don’t know it happened
"Already had sever bieffekt at times, but never really gotten any advice from my primary."
You can overdose or have a heart attack
300mg is INSANE.
"I got heart palpitations, racing heart rate, unbearable chest pains on a MUCH lower dose of 30mg Methylphenidate (different drug I know but I’m on 70mg of Elvanse now) and my blood pressure and heart rate would show as normal or a bit high most the time except when it was going 170 beats at rest for no reason and I felt like I was going to have a heart attack. 

I came off them and these side effects did not stop! For a couple of months"
"I thought I had permanent damage and that’s under medical supervision on a low dose. 

I’ve never been so scared for my life"
I had all the heart tests and scans
It’s not worth it
"I was one of the highest achieving students all through my education and I know you have exams etc and how important they might feel right now but once you’re in the workforce for a few years they become much less important and it’s just about experience. 

Trust me I have never been so scared"
"You might feel like you’re chasing a feeling right now and lower doses aren’t working but they ARE working and your body IS being physically affected, sped up and pushed to breaking point even if you can’t feel it or it doesn’t always show what’s going on internally. 

Remember you have ONE body"
You are born with ONE body
This is it
You don’t get a new one or a second chance
"You look after it or you can irreversibly damage it whether that’s misusing medication, smoking whatever"
I work in adult social care and reablement
"What you do shows up 20 years later, even if you think you got away with it because you’re young"
"It shows up and you pay the price. 

Please look after yourself"
Get help
I don’t know much about coming off but you may need help detoxing
"At least advice on whether you reduce slowly instead of stopping cold turkey. 

I hope none of this comes across wrong but you said below you need to hear it"
Take it all the right way
"You also sound manic or some psychosis right now (mum is bipolar I’ve experienced it a lot) which I wouldn’t be surprised on such high doses, which is not helping you to see straight and the severity of what you are doing. 

This could KILL you"
You could DIE
"That is it, no more life for you. 

I hope that helped"
Sending lots of love to you. 
70 mg is the *maximum* recommended dose in the U.S
Not the start dose
The recommended starting dose is 30 mg.
"Hey, I just went through my most recent scrip of Vyvanse 40mg in two weeks"
So I’m currently at the end of my first week without and can’t get a refill for another seven days
I’m doing fine and am grateful that I can’t get my hands on more til then because with my excessive tendencies I absolutely would be taking more.
I needed that
Thank you
Also why you are having problem sleeping
There’s no way someone could sleep on those doses unless you’re crashing
No sleep is not only very dangerous for your physical body but extremely dangerous for your mental state too
Lack of sleep is just adding to your whole situation xx
Thank you
This helped a lot
Thank you for reassuring me that I'm not alone
"I'll do better, and seek help to control it"
Please take care of yourself.
Feel free to message me anytime
I’ll share with you some life learned tips.

Adderall/Vyvanse vs caffeine and eating!

"caffeine wont typically affect ppl woth adhd, thats why its not affecting ur hunger"
adderall and vyvanse are drugs specifically intended for ppl with adhd so they will have an affect on u
"Well, caffeine isn’t an appetite suppressant"
"Adderall and Vyvanse are appetite suppressants, so is nicotine if you’re a smoker/vaper."

It’s Impossible Richard Branson or David Neeleman have what I have

"CEOs actually do very little ""regular work"""
"They mostly need to be present for the decision making process.

There's an interview out there where Bezos describes his day....and it's like my perfect working day with only about 2 hours of actual work in it.

Being a CEO would be my dreamjob."
CEOs of billion dollar corporations don’t need executive function capacity
They have an entire staff to outsource it to
"We can have a to-do list, they get a person to write their to do list, follow them around carrying it, schedule their tasks, tell them what’s next, follow it up, and cross it off when it’s done"
"We can have a calendar, they get another person to make all their appointments, give them a daily schedule briefing, tell them where they’re going and when to leave, hand them the files they’ll need there, and call for their car"
"We get a phone number and an email address, they get a person who is literally standing by waiting for them to say “send an email,” “make a call,” or “set up a call for me.” 

Then they go home to a house that’s been cleaned for them, eat food that’s been cooked for them from a kitchen that’s been stocked for them, maybe hang out with their pets that have been walked and fed and groomed for them, and probably drop their clothes on the floor to be picked up and laundered and put away for them"
"

You could absolutely do that"
Any one of us could!
Their circumstances and yours are completely different
"Privileges, opportunities, interests, treatment options, what makes them tick, etc"
Just because there is one common denominator doesn’t mean an objective comparison can be made.
The symptoms are always on the spectrum.
Money goes a long way to make the most devious ailments seem like banal quirks…
"Hey!

I've founded and run several companies"
"Some still going strong, some failed and long gone, none worth billions unfortunately"
"I'll offer some insight, which might be useful.

I'm ADHD, gifted, hve aphantasia and SDAM"
"Up until \~ 1 year ago, gifted was the only one of these I was aware of.

Honestly, looking back, ADHD is probably why I started so many projects and businesses"
"While I'd delete my ADHD in a heartbet if possible, there are some benefits in certain situations"
"My ability to say ""fuck it"" and ditch whatever I'm doing to start something new that has no certainty allows me to create opportunities for myself"
E.g
"I quit a good, low stress, secure job in a big company, rented an office and thought I'd start my own engineering firm"
"I had no savings, got a small business loan, and then realised I could last 3 months before I needed to draws a salary"
"I had a 12 month lease on the office, and 2 other people quit and joined me, so that 3 month deadline for paying salaries became the need to pay 3 people.."
"I don't know how many non ADHD people would display this lack of impulse control...

The excitement let me hyperfocus on getting shit done, and I regularly got a lot done.

Then procrastination and distractions lead to huge periods of inneficiency.

Then deadlines and stress lead to hyperfocus and getting loads done"
"For a long time this was enough to get me by and slowly grow the company.

I've started ecommerce businesses, a festival, and a few other things"
Starting a new project and hyperfocussing on stuff you're excited about was the easy bit for me
"I think the real ability to scale a business comes from identifying your own weaknesses and putting a team in place around you, especially to do the stuff you really can't.

A big part of it is luck, even if you do everything right, you ALSO need luck"
"One of my businesses worked a lot with startups, and I saw so many great teams, with great ideas, solid plans, proven markets, etc., but they didn't manage to find an investor to fund scaling, or too many of the identified risks occured despite identifying them and mitigating.

A big thing that will lead to failure, is continueing to try and do everything yourself, and pushing too hard at the stuff you are no good at"
This happened to me
"I got burned out, and fried my brain, my main business is now dust"
"The business that I started on a whim, that my wife runs is doing much better, the other business that I started with my wife, and she now does 90% of it is also going strong.."
"Without someone filling the gaps that I just can't do myself, things won't work, howver, without me being ridiculous enough to start them to begin with, the businesses would never have existed.

Moral of the story"
"YOU CAN DO IT, but not all by yourself."
Maybe they have never been details men
Most bosses have people who do that for them.
"You are not your diagnose, and either are they"
People with adhd can have more differences than similarities
"I am so much more than my adhd, I got lots of aspects of my personality that is not related to adhd"
I have no problem with education and I am thinking of having a masters degree or maybe a phd one day
"Some people are intelligent, some are not"
"Some people are kind and helpful, others are selfish"
And we have different interests
Stop putting yourself and others in a box
Adhd is not our identity
"It's the tool your doctor gave you to manage what's difficult for you sometimes, based on different symtoms that people with adhd have, and also other people have one or many of"
"Not saying you're not intelligent, just an example, because people tend to think that with adhd you can't accomplish anything"
"Find your path, your interest, and you will see that you can be as good as them on YOUR field 🫶

And also, adhd can make you creative, full of ideas, willing to risk more etc, which can be one of the reasons these people have success"
"You have to be a massive ruthless arsehole to succeed in capitalism, unfortunately"
"And I don't mean hold down a job, I mean get to the top by crushing competition."
Can you drop the link please?
"Totally, and any 'high-functioning' character in any movie is always followed by the beleaguered assistant who does the real organizational work."
I strongly disagree
"I’ve dealt with multi millionaires with ADHD, they are extremely high functioning"
They weaponize their ADHD into obsessive behavior around super productivity
But they also have personality traits that make them geared towards ultra success
"Things like low in neuroticism and ways of improving their organizational skills through adopting extreme habits.

I try everyday to hone in these skills and everyday I feel myself getting closer to my goals."
"Even if all of that is true, people like Richard Branson didn’t *start* with all that support around them"
"He didn’t start as a CEO of a multi billion dollar organisation, he built that organisation from scratch (from a mail order business selling records and a single record shop)."
"sorry i really don’t understand how this is supposed to somehow make their adhd insignificant enough for them to be able to function as efficiently as someone without adhd, because that all still sounds exhausting to me lol.

yeah the teams of people organising stuff for you is a HUGE advantage but overstimulation and burn out isn’t just reliant on organising"
"it’s the fact they have to constantly be doing stuff, stick to a strict schedule, deal with huge amounts of pressure and still manage other people too (they don’t literally do nothing, like they direct people too, even if it’s just a close inner circle of staff)"
"they also have to constantly be “on” in terms of socialising, networking, showing up for commitments, etc.
even just getting themselves out of bed for another long day of interacting with people or attending events or other work commitments…making sure they’re presentable, that they’re on time, etc.

like…that’s still nightmare fuel for adhd, is it not?!"
They weren't born into that position though
They got themselves into it from different starting points.
I understand but it’s hard for me even to do a month in a corporate job
I managed two masters degrees I don’t know how
But it just seems impossible to work in office even a few days in a row
"I can’t fathom that they would share the same cognitive abilities as me interms of working memory, focus etc."
Quick Google search
"

https://www.businessinsider.nl/jeff-bezos-daily-routine-2017-7?international=true&r=US#:~:text=He%20wakes%20up%20every%20morning,aid%20of%20an%20alarm%20clock.&text=Bezos%20makes%20sure%20to%20get,t%20worth%20it%20to%20him."
"Yeah, I don’t think we disagree"
The opportunity to obsessively focus on super productivity is also a function of not having to do anything else
It’s a lot easier to decide what you’re going to pay attention to and zone in when all of the annoying and uninteresting stuff is handled by someone else
Absolutely an ADHD person could thrive under those conditions.
"Can you tell us more about millionaires with adhd and your experience with them? 

Really curious, cause I got the belief the last weeks that I’m fucked now when it comes to being successful"
"Studying law right now and got diagnosed a few months ago and thought of quitting, because I thought success/high performance is not possible with this condition"
"Branson, the son of a lawyer and a ballet dancer, grandson of a judge"
"Not super wealthy, but certainly from a place of higher privilege than most people"
"Like many future oligarchs, his parents backed his early business ventures"
"Right, but it’s often that people don’t realize what it takes to get to that position"
They don’t just wake up successful
The focus should be on the journey
We can all replicate those behaviors to be more successful in life
"And trust me, even if they delegate a lot, and it is important, they still take on more than you could imagine."
"Happy to chat with you, DM me"
"But seriously, there’s no reason why you can’t be not only a success but one of the greats at whatever you decide to take on"
I nearly mentioned the fact that he had money and privilege to help get started
"But I left it out because I really don’t think it is relevant for the topic we are discussing of ”how can someone with ADHD be a CEO” and then “you don’t need executive function capacity to be a CEO”.

I just wanted to point out that he didn’t start as a CEO surrounded by an organisation he just had to make yes/no decisions over"
"He did need to be able to execute on a whole host of things over the years to start (and restart, it didn’t work first time) and build his business(es).

The situation AllegedLead described is not what Branson had while building Virgin, at least not to start with."
One of the things that it often takes to get into that position is being born into circumstances that allows one to make those choices in the first place
"

For every rags to riches story, there are thousands of riches to riches stories."
"Careful, it's very unpopular on reddit to give even a modicum of credit to anyone with wealth"
100% but in my line of work I deal exclusively with millionaires and billionaires
It’s definitely a dog eat dog world out there regardless
"But, I draw a hard line between self made and generational wealth"
The traits I’m describing are from self made
"With inherited wealth, the ones that make it are conservative spenders, well educated, and hire the right people to maintain their wealth"
It’s all about wealth management for those who have generational wealth
"But those that make it from nothing, there’s something admirable there."
"That’s okay, I’m not praising anyone"
"Just pointing out that if you can learn something, and it can help you in life why not"
"Doesn’t have to be about making money, you can apply the same principles just about anywhere in life."

Dissociation?
"Idk what that really means, just feeling weird and out of it"
I'm familiar with the term but not what it actually is.
I think it’s more common than we think
I don’t know how to explain it
I’m not sure I always recognise it in myself
It’s not necessarily as extreme as it’s made out to be
It’s like checking out and having autopilot take over when we’re stressed

Never got an “official” diagnosis
I had been on bupropion for about 15 years until it lost its effectiveness
So we pivoted to a stimulant
It’s made a substantial difference for me in most every facet of my life
"But everyone is different, so don’t be discouraged if you need to adjust your dosage or type of medication — and don’t be afraid to discuss it with your doctor"
"

Other tips that are mentioned frequently here:

Figure out how your body processes the medication and what foods work to it most effective (especially with extended release)"
Many swear by a little bit of protein
I do a high fat yogurt with my morning dose and some complex carbs in the afternoon
"That’s just what works for me after a decade of trial and error.

Assuming you’re going the stimulant route, and you’re in the US, understand that it’s a schedule II, so you aren’t going to be getting scripts with refills"
"Plan accordingly, and be prepared to deal with shortages"
"If you can take a few days off to stockpile in the event that your script is on back order, definitely do that"
"(My pharmacy allows me to fill 2 days early on a 30-day supply, which I always do in the event that it’s out of stock.)

And maybe most important, if your sleep schedule is abnormal, definitely normalize it"
Sleep is the one factor that makes or breaks the effectiveness of the medication
"

Good luck …and contrary to what you may hear, stimulants are a safe, well tolerated and very effective treatment for people who have ADHD."

I haven't been prescribed Adderall so I can't comment on that but I have been on Concerta for almost 2 years now
I also started with 18mg
Concerta would usually kick in after about 30mins to 1hr after I take it
Usually lasts for 8 to 12 hours
My mind would be so much calmer and I can do the things that I need to do
I also take a non-stimulant medication called Guanfacine
It definitely helps
"This is just me personal experience.

If Concerta doesn't work for you, I believe you might still have other medications that you can try."
I just did exactly what you did from Adderall 30 XR to Concerta 18 ER
 A week went by and I didn't notice anything
 My Dr
"today told me to take double, or 2 tablets a day.

I feel calmer, but I do not know if this is right for me."
Thank you 🙏

"IQ tests aren't always the most accurate, I would suggest talking to whoever diagnosed you and asking them about your cognitive abilities vs processing speed, they should know from your assessment!"
There's a subcategory in IQ which is called working memory
That's where i score badly compared to the other parts of my IQ
The researcher said it's often the case for people with Adhd to score significantly worse on that subcategory compared to the other subcategories
Just my two cents but you don’t write like you have an IQ of 77
I work in psych research and administer an IQ test to participants
IQ is some stupid made up bullshit
"So maybe you're not great at recognizing abstract patterns, giving dictionary definitions of words, or memorizing a sequence of numbers"
That's fine
It might mean school is a little harder for you
"But that stuff won't predict your performance in something you care about and put your time and effort into.

Edit: okay since this is getting some attention I should clarify what I mean"
"An IQ test might tell us that someone has really good working memory, the ability to hold a lot of info at once"
It might tell us how literate someone is or how good they are at grasping abstract concepts
"

But the thing is, I can study for a handful of the tasks"
I can study definitions of words
"I can learn tricks to improve my short term memory- for example, it's easier to recall a string of numbers if you group chunks of them"
"Thirty-one, forty-five, sixty-three is a lot easier than 3-1-4-5-6-3"
"

Which means it's not even measuring some innate part of you"
"

IQ will maybe tell how well you'll do in school"
"But you don't need a high IQ to perform well in sports, or come up with a unique character design, or tell an amazing story, or play guitar, or memorize a million cool facts about bugs.

To OP's edit- I don't know the data or research behind it"
But anecdotally- absolutely ADHD would affect many of the tasks
"I am TERRIBLE at finding the right words for things ALL the time, which is a big part of an IQ score"
Our working memory is also not always great.
Adhd doesn't affect your IQ in reality but I can definitely see how it could affect your IQ score in a test! If you can't focus enough on what's written in front of you an have to re-read or deel distracted that could definitely contribute to your ability to answer
If you have a maths learning disability that will also affect the score
"Neither of those things mean you are stupid, it just means you were given a test under conditions that weren't suitable or adapted for your needs to be able to read and answer how you would need.

Interestingly I recently learnt about NVLD which is tested by running test a bit like an IQ test, but where the differnt skill are separated out and if it finds a large disparity between scores in an area compared with another, I think  particularly verbal vs non verbal skills (aka you are intelligent spoken, but stuggle with some non verbal) then it could be an indication of it at a certain threshold"
"I'm not saying you have that btw, but I found it because I know I'm intelligent, no doubt, but I struggle with grasping certain things (I did programming and I understand the theories and what to do but when I go to do it I just breakdown overwhelmed).

I looked at my school reports from primary school and noticed two instances of ""struggles to grasp more complex concepts"" despite being very bright"
I had an above average reading age
And then I found out about NVLD
"I don't necessarily know or think that I have that, but it's an example of how we can have different skill levels in different areas and IQ tests don't seperate or account for that"
"So if you have a maths learning difficulty, it's not really accounting for a struggle you may have there and I wouldn't take it at face value.

I found a subreddit where there are tests that do sperate out and accommodate for this actually if you'd find it interesting, if I find it I'll link it, but if it moght upset you don't bother with it because you are more than an arbitrary test."
What I was told by the team that did my ADHD testing was that IQ cannot be accurately measured in people with ADHD
We are too inconsistent in our responses or something
I drifted off.
Someone once said something along the lines of “the only thing an IQ test will indicate is how good you are at taking an IQ test.”
"You know the difference between ""affect"" and ""effect"" so that alone probably makes you smarter than 90% of Americans."
ADHD would absolutely impact your ability to perform to your potential on a test
"It affects your IQ *score*, not your IQ."
That score isn't about your actual intelligence
It's about statistics
Standard deviations from the average refer to how far from the average your skill points when scored were
"Yes, those can skew the final ""IQ number"" but the final number doesn't actually matter as much as the variations in cognitive domains"
"You having a math learning disability having that drag down your score makes a lot of sense, but for you to have a true LD, you have to have otherwise average or higher intelligence"
"

I really wish assessors would try to explain this stuff to people because not everyone is running around with an encyclopedic knowledge of statistics"
That final number is meaningless to you
It's just for clinical diagnostic purposes
It doesn't tell you how smart or dumb you are
Intelligence is far too complex and sophisticated to quantify in a number like that
"

Clinician-patient medical/health literacy gaps are a real problem and I wish clinicians had some more sense and just explained what these scores/numbers actually mean to people"
"

Final IQ score does NOT dictate overall intelligence"
"It is a tool clinicians use to make diagnoses related to development and cognition, using statistical analysis"
You are perfectly intelligent as you are
"Just focus on the stuff you're good at, devoted to being better at, and that makes you feel fulfilled, engaged, and competent"
Focus on growing skills and an intrinsic sense of accomplishment
That final number is meaningless to you
It's just for doctors
"

Edit: I think the term ""intelligence quotient"" is too loaded and not very useful for what these tests actually do and what they're actually scoring"
"The word ""intelligence"" isn't even very useful in its main application and no I don't think MENSA tests are very scientific either."
There’s no correlation between ADHD and IQ
People with ADHD have more or less the same distribution of IQs as the general population
I know it’s easier said than done but try not to take the result to heart
It doesn’t say anything about your future
Don’t let it put psychological limitations on what you think you’re capable of. 
I don't think so
 Mine always tested between 135-142
 Doesn't mean I'm successful though
 Just have a lot of processing power
 I still forget to do things all the time and have to set reminders.
"ADHD impacts working memory, processing speed, information organization skills and attention"
Those components are tested in intelligence tests
A true test of IQ with ADHD could be more reliable (imo) with extra time that allows ADHD folks to analyze information on their own speed (of course with other factors such as medications and enhanced and ADHD-friendly learning techniques).
"ADHD isn't strongly correlated with intelligence (to the point where it's questionable whether the correlation is even significant), in other words, no, ADHD does not make you smarter or dumber.

ADHD can, and often does, interfere with your ability to take IQ tests, for all sorts of reasons, and obviously this is what an IQ test really measures, rather than intelligence itself (however you may define that)"
And this can go both ways
"For a lot of people, taking an IQ test is perceived as an unpleasant chore, and with ADHD, this can severely affect your performance for the worse - after all, you're on a timer, and if you spend a lot of time just getting yourself to try and solve the questions, then that will lead to lower scores"
"Likewise, if you get distracted a lot while taking the test, your scores will be lower"
"But on the other hand, if you love puzzles, and find this kind of test-taking format stimulating, then your ADHD brain might perform unusually well on the test, better than it would in a more realistic scenario, and you could end up with an inflated score, because the test assumes that you're doing it with a normal amount of motivation and focus"
"None of that says anything about your actual intelligence, but you end up with higher or lower scores regardless."
"My therapist was in high doubt whether I have adhd or not, the IQ test gave him “the push” to make a decision"
"

In general the IQ showcases different factors"
Pattern recognition is something that pulled the outcome up vs working memory pulling it down
"The separate outcomes in the test will show discrepancies between factors of the test, which is a “general” indication of “something is going on”"
"They, however, cannot base a diagnosis solely on an IQ test! If that happens, fight it"
"

I had to prove to him I had it, but the test gave him that little piece of extra information."
I strongly recommend you read about Growth Mindset theory
This idea of innate intelligence being accurately measured by a test is BS and so debilitating
"Do NOT let a test like this dictate your potential, self worth, or concept of who you are!"
IQ tests are affected by ADHD
"There is a very good Youtube video called adhd, IQ and giftedness by Russel Barkley, an adhd paychiatrist and expert, that explains it very well !"
IQ is an outdated and biased measure
"Yes, it can"
"  My verbal IQ is about 16 points higher than my performance IQ, which correlates with ADHD"
"  I'd ask for it to be broken down into verbal IQ, and performance iQ"
Are you sure they said you have an IQ of 77 or are you in the 77th percentile? (Many tests use percentile instead of an IQ number)
"

Also its common not be able to properly calculate a proper IQ for adhders because the processing speed and working memory brings it down (or the results are so different within categories, ranging from exceptional to below average, so sometimes the calculation makes no sense!)"
The first symptom of my adhd was difficulty taking tests
So that may impact iq tests too
"Firstly, as a special education teacher I would ask, why does it matter?   Success is based on so many variables, intelligence is a small price of the overall puzzle but not the defining price to happiness and success"
" Unless you’re seeking a profession that requires an IQ assessment be done for the role why does it matter? Who cares? Who in your life is judging you on the outcomes of an IQ test, a test done in brief moment in time? Your value as a human being is worth more than an IQ test.

To answer your question I read this:

If an intelligence test is riddled with bias, it would make it impossible to successfully measure a person’s intelligence."
not really and if it did it would only be by a few points
If it concerns you try taking another one when you’re medicated
But IQ isn’t really all that important in the grand scheme of things
It just means some things MIGHT be harder for you
Some things might be easier
People of all shades of IQ have difficulties with different things
Lower IQ usually (not always) has trouble with critical thinking skills
Higher IQ people usually (not always) have trouble with emotional/feeling skills
"
If you’ve seen Big Bang Theory think of it like Penny and Sheldon"
Penny is better at some things than Sheldon
A lot of things actually
Sheldon is good at a lot of things that Penny isn’t
They complement each other where one has what the other has a deficit in.
Did they give you just one number or did they also give you a breakdown of your scores? How was the test they did to measure your IQ? Was a test made out of multiple different tests?
My IQ is 135+ and I definitely have ADHD
"Most importantly, I’ve learnt to not let IQ score dictate anything because it really doesn’t"
"I was a straight A PLUS student, went to the Ivy League, my professor begged me do a PhD… but it doesn’t change that my adult life and personal relationships and mental state at my work is still severely affected ADHD"
I’m sure there are others with lower IQ who do better or are happier than me in certain areas
I would focus on your functionality
"Also, I find most IQ tests to favor only certain types of questions and honestly it just helps people who are good at test taking (me)."
Unsure tbh
I was placed in special ed and one of the parts to test out of it was an iq test
I got a 137 and have been diagnosed with adhd long before
I wouldn’t worry about the test my guy
ADHD certainly can interfere with taking tests
Normal people have expected normal abilities which let them do tasks in the expected time
An ADHD person doing the same task takes 5-10 times the expected time
That is a barrier that normal kids don’t face
"Tasks that were designed to be X hard, are much more difficult for ADHD people.

Because your ADHD is untreated, the test was harder for you than for a normal person taking the same test"
I would not put any confidence in that score
"

I suggest you get treated for ADHD- meds, counseling and time management- and take the test again, with accommodations for your ADHD"
I had a very detailed ADHD assessment
"It came out that I have severe ADHD with very poor working memory BUT quite a high IQ.
The problems they had me solving on the test were many and varied and I can see how they would show a difference between all those issues."
"If there’s a correlation, it’s because people with high IQ tend to mask better and not get diagnosed."
ADHD typically presents with reduced performance on sub testing measuring for working memory
Anxiety can also depress performance
Am IQ test is like a snapshot/picture of you on that day at that moment
Having a bad day or allergies or other factors can cause you to have a bad/ugly snapshot.
Most IQ tests are closely related to mathematical thinking
"So, if you have a math disability, then that might very well be why you scored so low"
"You might be good at other, less abstract, things"
It’s hard to say wether or not your score has any significance when its not clear what kind of IQ test you did
"Just a multiple choice one with some pictures where you have the repeat a pattern? Those tests are BS, and you could disregard your low score"
"
If the test actually touched on more areas, such as language, emotion, critical thinking, then the score might better reflect your intellectual level"
"But again, if you’re sat down at a table asked to answer some questions, ADHD has a tendency to ruin your focus"
"The majority of your brain power is being used to try and focus, so you only have so much left to actually answer the questions"
"

If you’re generally a quick learner when there’s something you’re interested in, then you probably shouldn’t worry about your IQ scores."
"No, they're not related in either direction"
"If you had an IQ of 77, you wouldn’t be able to write those sentences, let alone adequately describe your confusion regarding the results of said IQ test."
Dunno
Many severely ADHD people score really well on IQ and other tests designed to assess intelligence
"

That you scored poorly, though, doesn’t mean that the test is accurately assessing your innate abilities."
Good question! I'm wondering the same thing
"About ten years ago (when I was 7), I had a psychological evaluation where they used the WISC-III test to assess intelligence, ADHD, autism, and more"
"For IQ, there were two scores: verbal and performance"
"If there was a gap of 20 points or more between them, it indicated a VP gap.

As tests have evolved, they’ve gotten better"
"For example, in the WISC-V, a VP gap is no longer considered a major factor, as it tends to be seen in gifted individuals"
"However, not all gifted people struggle with concentration, planning, or time management"
"What the heck is wrong then?

In elementary and high school, my mom helped me a lot with learning and time management, so those years weren’t very difficult for me"
I managed to get through by attending classes and doing some homework during class time
"I usually started studying for exams the Saturday before (which is typical for me), and my exams went decently"
"I earned good grades without really studying.

In university, though, I was left to my own devices, meaning I had to make my own decisions"
"Unfortunately, those decisions haven’t been great"
"I'm on the verge of failing a course, not because I'm dumb, but because my time management isn’t great"
This has caused a lot of frustration and stress
"In about a 2 weeks, I’m going to see a psychiatrist to see if I have ADHD."
Read Visual Thinking by Temple Grendin
And no ADHD doesn't affect intelligence
If you want to feel better I am even unable to finish this test because it's soooo boring ;___;
https://youtu.be/4_BIaLhdkrw? Russell Barkley has this on his YouTube channel
I was recently thinking that due to the attention deficit we might have a worse result in that test than we would have without that deficit
"Especially with timed tests.

I am not saying all people with severe ADHD will have bad results, I say that all people with ADHD would improve their results if the severity of the disorder was not that impactful."
I've never done one but I'd be proved dense if I did it off meds
Barely know my own name unmedicted.
Most people who speak to me think I'm intelligent
"This is because I'm well spoken, relatively insightful, and have knowledge on a bunch of random topics"
"However my ADHD really impacts my ability to articulate my points, and I often lose track of what I'm saying if it's a long point.

So in my opinion ADHD doesn't impact your intelligence directly, just your ability to express that intelligence effectively."
"I found this on Instagram recently, not tied to IQ just feeling like you could achieve more if you could apply yourself

https://www.instagram.com/p/DAMm0KqSdXf/?igsh=MXBlY2V5MXA5aXg3bg=="
Your IQ remains same but by managing ADHD you perform closure to your IQ on daily / consistent basis vs during unmanaged.
I feel like your post is written well enough to me that it appears to be some anecdotal evidence of an IQ a good bit higher than 77
" 

IQ tests are not a perfect science and it’s very possible that if you were unable to concentrate that you scored much lower than you should have."
ADHD does affect analytical ability
Not sure if it related to IQ though
IQ is an irrelevant variable when it comes to a persons intellect
It’s pseudo science and primarily utilized by racists to add a semblance of validity to their assertions.
"Statistically you are more likely to suffer from ADHD when your IQ deviates from the norm.

ADHD impacts specifc Tests more severly then others"
"If you happen to know the name of the test you can look it up!

I've done 2 official tests and scored with over 35 difference in points.

and the standard deviation for most tests is 15 i think.

So one test alone especially with ADHD doesnt say alot.

  
Have trust in yourself and dont let a number judge you"
"Trust the way you feel about your intelligence, since you are the only one to truly know what is going on in your head."
"lol i’ve had 2 official IQ tests when I was younger,

One said I had an IQ above 110 and the other said it was 80

The thing is IQ tests are not reliable and only serve as a guide, things like motivation to finish and also practice effects their scores so they’re not an effective measurement"
"From my experience, high stress can give you a much lower score in an IQ test"
"Not sure tbh, when they tested me for adhd I got a score of 129, didn’t even know they were testing my iq so that came as a surprise"
I wouldn’t put too much thought into the numbers though
I’m terrible at stuff that others are awesome at
We’re all awesome in our own way
"Yes, they can affect the score"
"A well designed IQ test would prob be harder to affect, but there are no well designed IQ tests, and there isn’t a lot of consistency across different ones.

If having that number matters to you, you could just keep retaking different IQ tests until you find one you vibe with on a good day to get a good score with"
"But knowing that, you hopefully can just not worry about it."
"Probably a little bit, other things can affect the score too"
How well did you sleep the night before your test? Do you have test anxiety? When's the last time you did a standardized test in an environment like that? There are a ton of reasons why a single low IQ test score should be all but meaningless to you.
People can be anywhere on the IQ spectrum and have ADHD
"While I agree with others that your writing doesn’t scream to me that you have an IQ of 77, perhaps you were in a bad place when you took the test"
"

I’m what’s called twice exceptional, I have ADHD and a very, very high IQ"
"

Does ADHD affect IQ? Not exactly, it’s more like it affects what you can do with your IQ."
"ADHD can absolutely affect the score of a IQ test, as concentration is a big part of the test"
"I'm pretty sure I would've gotten the score ""banana"" when I took mine if it hadn't been for it being my hyperfocus of the time"
ADHD does not affect your IQ
It does affect how good you can focus on an IQ test tho.
For a while there psychiatrists used to use IQ tests as a tool to diagnose ADHD
"I does not affect your IQ usually IQ is ment to determine your cognitive capabilities as well as your potential and I’d say ADHD individuals have a lot of cognitive potential if they put their brain on it, for instance I excel in biology I love biology, but do so poorly in physics I just don’t quite understand it but it comes to cardiology which follows a very close system to electrical lines in series and parallel a concept that was so hard for me to grasp on its own began to make a loads more sense"
So I’d say that in terms I f intellect we are avg if not better we just have to be really into it for us to flourish
"I was diagnosed as a kid and about 9 I got an IQ test, I scored 127.

The point IS that I probably enjoyed the test so I hyperfocused on It and gave my 100%

If somehow I would got bored midway, my scored could be way lower.

Adhd doesnt affect ur IQ but It can affect your score on the test."
I guess if it's timed
Lack of focus may impact your score.
Yes it 100% can
"(To preface this I just want to share my story, I don't want to sound like I'm boasting or anything"
Also this is just from what people told me
"Plz feel free to correct) 

The way it was explained to me was that there are 2 parts to an IQ test, logic and reasoning and memory"
"I scored really high (98-99 percentile) on the logic and reasoning part, but quite low on most memory parts (25-35th percentile)"
So it evened out to around 125
"A lot of the memory also requires an attention span, which some of us don't have or just forget easy"
"We may just not be able to pick up on the info in the first place, let alone remember it"
"The way the test is set up also leaves room for a lot of simple mistakes common with ADHD, which I had quite a few of"
 I was actually diagnosed with ADHD during my IQ test because of my performance
"

I was actually tested for IQ about 2 years earlier than that as part of another thing"
"I was on a medication at the time that was also used to treat adhd, however I was on it for a different reason"
 That time I scored a 139
"It's quite unusual to see an almost 15 point drop within two years, and I suspect it has something to do with being medicated"
"(I had not had any traumatic brain injuries or other related issues that may have impacted it) 

Long story short, take IQ with a grain of salt"
"It's not the most reliable thing, and intelligence is complicated"
"

TLDR: Have ADHD, scored high on logic and reasoning and low on memory"
Also had a 14 point difference in results from when I was medicated/unmedicated.
"IQ tests are bullshit.

They test specific skills based on a specific kind of intelligence and are not a useful metric"
Intelligence as a whole is also completely unquantifiable in people
"A lot of what is seen as ‘intelligence’ is skills that can be trained, and if it can be trained, then it isn’t innate, which means that the whole concept goes out the window"
"Sure, obviously people have different propensity for different skils and ways of thinking and some people have learning difficulties and disabilities which can affect cognitive ability- but the only way to test that is with nuanced thinking and in depth understanding of a person- no single test can determine these things and it definitely isn’t universal"
"

Basically- this test score doesn’t define you and it really doesn’t mean anything"
Only you and (maybe) your doctor know how ADHD affects your brain and your cognitive ability
But if what you’re asking is ‘Can ADHD affect ability to take tests?’ then I’m sure you already know the answer is yes.
"Everyone's ADHD symptoms manifest differently, but   I have always had a difficult time with long tests"
Other people I know with ADHD have had issues as well
"I'd get bored, lose my train of thought, answer a question incorrectly because I would try to answer quickly, etc.

An IQ of 77 means you are cognitively impaired - I doubt you'd even be able to post a comment on reddit or have the self awareness to know that ADHD  is a problem that affects you if that was your IQ!  In general, standard IQ tests are bullshit - there is not one kind of intelligence"
"If you need to take the test for some reason, see if you can get some ADHD accommodations and take it again"
"

Good luck and don't let one number on a random test define who you are and how you think of yourself!"
IQ tests mostly test how well you take the test
"There are artificially low results for lots of reasons when people aren't good at test taking.

I am really good at taking tests, so an IQ test would show me as higher than I probably am"
"If you're not good at tests and couldn't focus, yes your score could be lower than reality."
"iq tests measure some types of inteligence, pattern identificación, etc 

last time i was 118 i have adhd i had done it in the past and it was  135 depends a lot if you are familiar with the tests, etc etc"
ADHD means your brain is wired different
I have struggled with ADHD and dyslexia my entire life
I was diagnosed about a month ago I’m in my late 30’s
You are okay
Once we know what’s causing us to fail it’s easier to pick ourselves up and try again
"
You aren’t your diagnosis, you’re not a test scores"
"
We all have diffrent challenges in life, over come and enjoy friend."
Attention is a pretty significant limiting factor in actual intelligence scores
"If you can't pay attention, you can't understand what is being asked if you or complete a logical sequence of steps to problem solve"
"If you can pay attention consistently, you will be able to do these things, which significantly improves your chances of accurately tackling the task."
No it doesn’t
 But test taking can be  affected by ADHD.
IQ is a bit of a misnomer
" It's not ""this is how generally intelligent you are"" the way it's viewed a lot of the time, but instead more of a measure of ""how good are you at being smart in very specific things in a very specific way"""
" There are many ways to express intelligence that aren't even measured by IQ, and on top of that IQ itself is a terrible predictor of anything other than ""how well will you score on an IQ test""."
"I've heard that it does, but to be honest the way you write doesn't sound like a person with below average IQ"
"So, I would take it with a grain of salt."
"I have adult ADHD (38 years old), I have scored an IQ of 131 (official test by MENSA) and I haven’t taken a test after taking Concerta"
"I highly doubt it makes a difference in normal conditions and psychological preparation.

(On the contrary, maybe overfocusing might have helped slightly during the test, as it clearly helped me during university exams and busy times at work.)

However, if you were tested mentally unprepared, the score is absolutely invalid"
"I believe that there are times that I would have scored much lower, especially during stress and times when my ADHD “levels” disable my hyper focus.

And lastly, IQ tests tend to be a bit overrated, as I see them, they measure the speed of practical thought but not the potential outcome at longer given times"
So don’t underestimate yourself based on the score alone but what you can potentially achieve in the end.
"Yes, if you can’t focus on the test then you won’t get an accurate score."
Test show adhd doesn't affect iq but it can interfere with motivation and focus giving you a false result
"

At the end of the day iq doesn't matter it doesn't dictate your future, only you can do that"
"


I'm the same as you, I had my iq tested in school and got a low score"
This devastated me but over time I learned persistence and work gets you more of what you want not brain power alone
"

Don't let this get you down, go out kick butt and after you succeed youll see none of that matters"
"Hahahahaha, 77 at least you can type....but seriously my IQ could not be tested on the day i was taking the neuropsychological eval exam for adha, they said it was way low, and they knew i was smart by the way i talked (thats what they told me)......."
I can tell from the single paragraph that you just wrote that your IQ is higher than 77.
I passed the IQ test given at school in the 90s enough to attend the gifted program weekly but not enough to go everyday like some of my friends
I remember having to take the test twice when no one else did
"Looking back, I think my ADHD interfered with how I scored"
"IQ test ask you to be soooo focus, yes of course ADHD affect IQ"
"And remember, as other poeple have told and as you should have noticed after passing the test, this is just a bunch of exercices you can work on"
IQ results are just like math test result for me
Not a definitive and ultimate number that defines your inner intelligence.
It does
At lest it did in my case
"I scored something like 115 in logical reasoning and 132 in verbal, but my tester explained  that it dropped to 108 because I just reached 60 in executive functions. 
If I would take the test today it would be even lower. 


but at the end of the day, what matters the most is your happiness"
"If you can overcome it and live a nice life, IQ becomes as relevant as a rock. "
"I have ~130 (official test in 2 weeks) with severe ADHD.
Having low or high IQ makes difference only if affects you.
I would be more happy to have lower IQ.


77 with standard deviation of 15 is between 62 and 92"
"Some people think that ADHD can affect IQ tests up to 30 points, so in this case you may have between 92 and 122. 
In the worst case 60, in best 120. 
If you can make a post here it is probably not 60.
Iq only measures your cognitive potential"
But as most of the people can confirm - hard work is much more important to be successful
Unfortunately ADHD ruins every good plan I have
So having high IQ gives me a job with $15k per year
Do you still want high IQ?
"IQ is subject to controversy but consensus is that it just highlight a part of overall intelligence, not everything.

About IQ score itself, ADHD as a very low impact on test scores (from 0 to minus 5 pts) whereas Anxiety disorder has a much greater impact (around minus 20 pts).

How are your results on sub categories of the test ?"
"I actually had to binge some research on it.

Short answer: Yes and No, but not because of ADHD itself.

Long answer (from the top of my head):

ADHD, dyscalculia (what you have with math), dyslexia and even autism used to be correlated with low IQ, but this has been changing on the last 3 decades because turns out.."
"surprise, surprise.."
"we learn differently, and being forced to learn the way everyone does, doesn't work"
"The only thing that changed was accommodations.

As for your confidence, coming from someone that got the result slightly above average, it isn't sunshine and rainbows"
"High IQ is correlated with a lot of emotional dysregulation and other problems and my therapist said most of my problems come less from ADHD and mostly from it, especially childhood depression by not being able to have anyone to relate to you.

Also.."
I can't help but feel the more I check IQ tests..
they feel like bullshit
"They deal with general stuff, not stuff you might actually know a lot"
The math part is TERRIBLE
"I can craft formulas for myself, do spreadsheets, and a whole bunch of things but I have terrible memory, so doing them on my head made me suck at them"
"Definitely doesn't correspond to how *I* work/adapted.

You can also study for them, and they get less and less accurate the higher you go"
"Some people with IQ of 140 may be absolute geniuses or kids that will never be functional for the rest of their lives, and every 2\~3 years they have to round up the math again, because the new generation gets higher points than the last one, and they basically don't know why"
"Which personally is a major red flag on a scientific evaluation.

tl;dr: IQ tests are the dick size of brains."
"\>can the symptoms of ADHD affect the score results on an IQ test?

short answer: yes"
 Take it again after getting medicated and see what happens.
IQ is a stupid measurement
Don't get hung up on it.
"It does affect ADHD, that's why I had to take one for my diagnosis"
I've also been taught how to administer them
IQ-tests are just an approximation of someone's reasoning/visual abilities at a given time
"It's not a ""real"" value"
If you have dyscalculia that will lower your score but it does not mean you're stupid.
First: I absolutely do not agree with the people who say IQ is bullshit
"Yes, the overall score does not say a lot"
"But if you have had the wais, you get scores on different areas like arithmetic, linguistic, processing speed and stuff.

Like I have a low processing speed (score 80/90) speed while I score realty high (score 120/130) on spatial insight & analysis"
"

My overall IQ was like 110 or so.
The overall score doesn’t really say something, because I can work on a high level when I get the time to do my work, and don’t work at an chaotic environment.

The test is giving you a good insight of ADHD.

Then, the answer to your question: yes, ADHD/medication can affect your IQ"
"Without medication your, for example, processing speed can be lower because your not able to focus on the test as good as with medication"
"And then you probably will do other questions (like mathmethics) also betten with then without meds.

We did the test without medication, but will do it next year again with medication.
It’s something, luckily, our psychiatrist practice would like to test with us.(before and after treatment)

Our whole family has been tested this year and we have 4 different diagnosis with 5 people 😊
(ADHD type 1, ADHD combined/ASD (upper ASD), ADHD combined/ASD (upper ADHD), and ASD."
IQ tests are unfortunately pretty rigged for certain folks and have a terrible history behind it
I wouldn’t worry too much about it
The late Stephen Hawking would probably agree.
It affects the results
 If you can't do the test of course you get a low IQ
" In 1st grade, I had a ""27"" IQ"
After being diagnosed..
let's just say it's high.
There's zero chance you have an IQ as low as 77
You don't even hang out in the communist subreddits.
IQ tests are the best at measuring IQ
"That is it.

i have ADHD and dont start my treatment for another 2 weeks, so it is untreated per se, yet i had to take an IQ test with a neuropsychologist back in April this year and scored very high, now i'm unsure of the precision surrounding the following statement but it was said by my neuropsychologist.."
"""you scored 121, but we can not take that as your reading because the test was administered in your secong language, if you would like the official status of genius then you should go and get tested in an english speaking country"" so by this im assuming she means i could be 140+ which to me just seems outrageous, i'm not going to, i just want medication and this was a hoop i had to jump through, i was more then happy with just being above average.

we are all intelligent in different ways though, but 77 seems very low, i think 70-75 is classed as learning difficulties..

so im smart, but my navigational skills are the worst, my american friend who comes to france to visit knows the roads around my house better than i do and i have lived here 21 years, i have many grey areas.."
as does everyone.
I was always told i had a high IQ as a kid but didn't apply myself.
"IQ tests are different depending on where you live, each country has different tests and standards"
"If you can't standardize it globally, then throw it in the trash."
"Why even do IQ tests? Do you also rank your physical abilities on a scale? Your looks? Maybe, but it's always gonna depend on who you ask and what ""test"" they put it through"
"IQ tests are more normalized I guess, still doesn't change the fact that it's a somewhat subjective test that gives a somewhat arbitrary score.

Has your IQ ever stopped you from doing something you wanted? What happens if you achieve something that shouldn't be possible at your ""level""? It's a stupid test and a stupid measurement, of course, your score is gonna screw with your mind"
"Keep taking tests until you get a super high score or something, surely that will help.

Sorry if it sounds condescending, just writing down my thoughts..."
I think I'm intelligent ***BECAUSE***  of my ADHD
"My short-term memory is shit , but if it makes it to long term memory it's trapped in a cage"
I can use something I learned from chemistry class from high school(A class I barely passed) and use it as a machinist
"

My advice would be to not worry about the things that you can't do, but focus on the things that you can"
"If you build up the things you can do, it'll leak over into the things that you can't do"
Sometime just off of sheer confidence.
Iq tests are meaningless
"Also, ask yourself why you actually care?
The fact that you care at all probably makes you smarter than at least a solid portion of the population"
Be happy with that or expand your knowledge
Either way dont dwell on stupid iq tests.
i would say yes
I scored 126 when I was 5 - I think this was tied to my disgnosis
"later, in hs i was tested and i got 104, but the person testing me wasn't very considerate considering the fact i was exhausted bc duh, it was near 7am, and taking into account i was on the wrong set of meds then that caused extreme brain fog"
"and, keep in mind, i'm sure there were other things like being hungry that set me back, but i can't remember"
"about a year ago i took the online mensa challenge and got 142, but honestly, i don't know how accurate that is compared to the other tests - this only tests pattern recognition"
"on top of all of this my memory went from 0-100 when i finally found the right med, and this is only recently - so, it's possible my iq could be over 142 if indeed that test is accurate"
"overall, likewise to you, i suck at math - it was my worst subject (yes, i cried over pre calc💀)"
"but, after being medicated, i look back and can't believe i cried over it because it's like a joke to me now bc it's so easy, thanks to my adhd med - p.s"
"i'm taking it in college bc it was so traumatic that my brain forgot everything after i took those tests, and bc of this, i couldn't get into calc which is required for my chem eng major - and yes, my memory was shit then bc i took it in hs without being medicated"
"if i could give you any advice to help you, i would say: work out, find the right adhd med; idk your age, but if you're 18 or over take creatine because it helps a fuck ton with memory in my experience, try listening to those colored noises when you sleep, and if your sleep quality is fucked up from your adhd like me, take melatonin"
"Also, both times I took IQ tests the score actually returned inconclusive because there was such massive variance in how well I did on the parts I did well on versus how poorly I did on the part that I struggled with, due to my ADD."
"IQ tests are easily cheated, too"
"I maxed out on visual memory, but I did terrible on this one, like, 3/15 or something."
"Working memory and processing speed dragged down my IQ score, and those are both related to ADHD."
In the document my psych made for evaluating if I have adhd I had to do some IQ related tests
"I don't remember it word for word but he made the statement in there that some of the tests were meant to remove working memory from the equation, and he gave an IQ equivalent and said measurements with working memory meant an equivalent of 115 and if we take away working memory from testing it implies 125"
So I don't know how official all of the testing was but I thought it was interesting that did some testing that tried to account for it
That makes sense
Most scores were average or fine expect for those
"They even said my premorbid cognitive functioning was superior and my verbal ability, but some stuff related to memory/function I was like borderline impaired or low average"
Speaking of working memory
I still remember the moment I discovered what a real effective working memory was like when I was shelving books at my job last Friday
It was the first day I ever took lisdexamphetamine and it was surreal
"I was able to remember multiple books at the same time authors full name, titles, whether they were part of a series, how many spots I needed to open to fit them, etc"
it was incredible
"





I still remember when I used to officiate for hockey I would often forget numbers, the penalty I wanted to call, what side each team was on for offside calls, penalty signals, etc"
If I was to go back with what I have now I honestly think I would enjoy reffing a lot on top of my increased confidence.
This is said to pretty much everyone who says they have an iq in that range between 70-80 iq
It just seems we have overestimated how much a lower iq score affects someone’s writing ability
"And I think we need to be careful with saying things like this as it might undermine the difficulties that those who get those iq scores might have, similar to how it might feel like someone with adhd has their struggles undermined when people say things like it doesn't seem like you have adhd since you can focus so well on video games or since you have such good grades."
Yeah I was thinking the same thing here.
And we haven't even gotten into how it's been used as part of racist pseudoscience
"At best, IQ has very limited applications."
"You’re saying that IQ is made up BS, but you are still acknowledging that OP might not be good at the things that are usually tied to higher intelligence"
"

I agree that IQ scores don’t hold any predictive power"
"A lot of people like to tie higher IQ’s to higher levels of “success” where the metric of success is usually financial success, but I don’t think there is a causative relationship"
"

But IQ tests, especially the ones done by psychologists/psychiatrists that are not simple multiple choice psychometric puzzles, is the best quantifier for intelligence we have"
"Tests like Mensa are BS, but that doesn’t make all IQ testing BS."
😂
"That’s true, also in school I never had a problem with any other subject except for math, I have dyscalculia."
"I forgot to put this in my comment, I was diagnosed with it since I was young."
"What I mean is could it affect the scores on the test because of the symptoms, I didn’t mean that if you have ADHD that means you have a low IQ"
You’re right I will try not to let that affect me.
Same
I didn’t even realize I was being given an IQ test when I was going through my diagnosis
I think scored like a 135
"I killed the vocabulary and pattern/sequence recognition parts of the test, but did noticeably worse on the parts that required memory"
"

That being said, I think IQ tests are kind of a load of horse crap, and I don’t see what they have to do with an ADHD diagnosis"
It just means my brain is especially tailored for certain things that the IQ tests looks for
"I do not believe it has anything to do with my intelligence, because honestly I think I’m kind of a dumb ass."
"Same, my IQ tested is higher than average, but yesterday I put the mayo in the pantry and the peanut butter in the fridge with my IPhone 😆"
Meanwhile I’ve always scored in the 100-110 range
Which is dead average.
"I am in the second category, suffered with 'gifted child' syndrome as a result!"
"I should have made my tittle more clear, I meant if it effect’s my IQ score because of my symptoms of ADHD"
"Thank you, I didn’t really know how an IQ test worked because I never took one, and they didn’t explain it to me."
They diagnosed me with Borderline Intellectual Functioning based on the IQ test and I disagree with it.
This is true.
they gave us an IQ test in the “gifted and talented “ program when I was a kid.
didn’t do very well but now I know why
"Yeah I agree, because a IQ of 75 and below is categorized as an intellectual disability and 77 is close to that."
"This exactly, 77 is non functional"
Really? What I’ve read says the opposite and what my therapist told me.
Yes I have trouble with this too
"I really can’t pay attention, my mind just thinks about other stuff, and it makes it hard to concentrate."
"> 77 with standard deviation of 15 is between 62 and 92.

That's not how standard deviation works.

""Standard deviation of 15 (points)"" means that 68% of the population are within +/- 15 points of the mean, which itself is set at 100 for IQ"
"If you have 1000 random people take an IQ test, the expected outcome is that 997 of them score between 55 and 145, 950 of those score between 70 and 130, and 680 score between 85 and 115"
"You would also expect 500 of them to score below 100, and the other 500 above 100.

The 15-point standard deviation says nothing about confidence in an individual result."
"No one wants to have a low IQ hahaha, I don’t know if I have this IQ because my therapist said they don’t think I have a low IQ as that, and they explained why."
Yeah I was suffering from really bad anxiety at the time when I took the test.
"I don’t think that my IQ is 77, but people’s who have an  IQ of 77 or below have a lot of emotional dysregulation"
An IQ of 75 and below is an intellectual disability and they can’t control their emotions like someone with average IQ can.
wdym by upper asd and upper adhd?
"There is pretty much no existing psychological measure, illness, or other that is generalizable/standardizable globally"
Does that mean that they're all garbage?
"I don’t believe I have a 77 IQ, that’s close to an intellectual disability and I can function good in my day to day things"
"I guess is different for people,  because there are some here that say it affects it and others that say it doesn’t."
"just wanted to add - as you can see, my iq scores are everywhere"
"so, just bc you scored 77 doesn't mean you'll score that again if you take another shot at it"
"likewise, ADHD absolutley affects your score (I also have severe adhd, mine is both hyperactive and inattentive) Edit - if you somehow can't get on adhd medications, coffee can help, do your research though because everyone is different, and idk how helpful it really is"
"Yeah exactly, that's why adhd sucks so bad, it's the difference between our cognitive abilities and processing speed"
"Um, I mean they can definitely be easily cheated to make your scores lower than they should be (purposefully not performing to the best of your true abilities), but how can they be cheated in a way to score higher than your abilities?

Just by studying/practicing the types of questions and tasks given within them? That's not really 'cheating' them is it?"
"splinter skill ftw, while it isnt an IQ test on my act I got a 32 in reading and comprehension, while in writing I only got a 17"
"Saame, maxed out on visual intelligence and got slightly below average on working memory"
I’ve never done a proper IQ test but working memory and processing speed are two of my biggest issues so this definitely rings true.
"Yes, and some psychologists will tell you to exclude processing speed in order to more accurately calculate the IQ score."
"I think you're coming from a good place, but I disagree"
"Having a low IQ is not seen by most people as a validation of a person's struggles; rather, it's often viewed as evidence of a person's inferiority"
"With something like ADHD or Autism, these terms can sometimes be used pejoratively (especially autism) but other times are used as a neutral description of certain types of difficulties"
"By contrast, it is *always* an insult to be labeled as ""low IQ."" This is because people have a tendency to view IQ scores as representing the overall value of a person's mind, rather than their ability to perform specific kinds of tasks (however generalizable) measured by the test.

This is such a deep-rooted sort of bias about IQ that it is typically not noticed, as it tends to be taken for granted by all sides of a conversation: for example, rather than questioning the social value and meaning we attach to an IQ score, people will question whether the IQ score was accurate *in this particular case,* with *this particular demographic,* etc"
"etc.

I think questioning and undermining the significance of IQ scores would be a good idea, as I don't think we can decouple the score from the attitudes that we have attached to it."
"Btw an IQ 70-75 is categorized as an intellectual disability, people with that IQ can’t write like this, or express themselves in this way."
"Objectively, having a tested high IQ means you're good at taking IQ tests."
The concept of IQ testing is BS and very archaic
Intelligence is extremely fluid and we can't define it properly yet
"How can we assign values to things that can't be quantified or measured through mathematics (for example)? No brain imaging, fMRIs, testing can actually ""measure"" intelligence"
"It may be the best available quantifier for intelligence, because we have a very limited understanding about the brain"
"

We have to remember psychology is a social science; it's not pure science with empirical principles."
"Just because IQ testing is the best we have according to your response (which I’m not agreeing with), doesn’t mean it’s valid or should be used in its entirety"
"Segments and portions can be used to reflect and evaluate, that’s it though imo"
What are you defining as intelligence? The ability to solve complex math problems? Does the ability to rebuild an engine or wire a house not count? Does the ability to make decisions quickly on one's feet and make good plays in sport not count? To me the idea of intelligence is not a one size fits all as there are different ways ot can show up and be used.
You could retest once you’re treated if you want to.
I don’t think ADHD in itself causes significant deviations in IQ score because it’s not an intellectual disability
"However, if the test was administered by a psychologist they probably would have given you a test that gives you a breakdown of your IQ in multiple sections"
Sometimes in people with attention issues there’s a discrepancy between working memory and other sections
"Did the psych tell you the scores of each section? But regardless even if you scored more or less the same in each section, I don’t think you should obsess over the score, as I said before it tells you nothing about your future. "
"It could, yes."
"Yeah, absolutely! I've taken one when I was well rested and well medicated and had scored around 140"
"I took it again when I was burnt out and unmedicated and scored around 130, and it probably would have been lower if that were my first time taking it"
"The IQ test is still just a test, and TONS of things can factor into it."
"I live in Denmark, we never had IQ tests in school"
"We just had regular tests in the different subjects, and then you were judged according to that"
"Every year there would be 2 national tests, where every student in the country would go through a standardized test with 50 questions in the main subjects like Danish, English, and math"
Then you were given one of 6 grades depending on your performance
"

The grades were: lacking, below middle, middle/average, above middle, very good, excellent"
"

Then you were given the right support in the right classes depending on your grade."
All testing is limited
You have to look at how the test was created - did the creators test for accuracy and reliability within the ADHD population? My guess is no - they were assessing testing validity across a normal population
"

Has the test been assessed for reliability & validity for  the ADHD population specifically? If not, why is the person administering the test to you confident that the test is an accurate reflection of your abilities?"
Thank you for the explanation. 
"Then wait some times before retaking the test, wait for you to forget the content of the test, wait for your anxiety to be under control, and you will get a much more relevant score.

Anxiety is a common comorbidity, and it affects scoring a lot.

The correlation between ADHD and intelligence deficiency is real BUT exists only because ADHD is a disorder, not a disease"
"Symptoms are evenly shared by all intelligences but it becomes a disorder only when it causes a social problem, so as highly intelligent people cope with symptoms better than other, it is rarely discovered for them"
"And working memory.

Edit: In the psychological testing I had done most recently, my FSIQ/GAI scores were in the 95th and 97th percentile respectively (124/128)"
My highest subtest score was in the perceptual reasoning index in the 98th percentile (131)
"However, both my verbal comprehension index and processing speed index scores were over half a standard deviation lower than that in the 88th and 91st percentiles (118 & 121) respectively, and my most significant deficit in IQ was in the working memory index, where my score was in the 55th percentile (102, almost two standard deviations lower than my FSIQ!!)"
"I agree that ""having a low iq"" is interpreted in a way to think you're inferior or generally that it's often tied to people's sense of self worth"
"I definitely agree with that! At the same time, though, I have seen several people with low iq say they don't like when people tell them they can't have low iq because they write well"
There was even a post about this on the low iq subreddit
This is not about feeling a pleasant sense of validation from thinking they're not as intelligent as most people
"It's more so that there are people out there with intellectual disability, or close to it (""low iq""), and who aren't doing well because they are struggling, and when people keep telling them they probably don't have low iq or can't have low iq given that they write fairly well and articulate their thoughts fairly well, that's going to potentially make them feel gaslit that their other struggles aren't real or that they're their own fault"
That's the way that they're going to have their experience undermined and invalidated
Not that they're happy to know/believe they have lower iq.
I think that's one of the things i'm questioning
ADHD is considered a disability related to deficit in attention
But that doesnt mean people with ADHD can't focus in any context
"So similarity, just because low iq is defined as an intellectual disability doesn't mean someone with a low iq can't focus the intellectual resources they do have (even if limited) in such a way to construct a relatively well-articulated paragraph"
"Low iq is an intellectual disability, not a writing disability."
"Yes, I'm great at tests so I do really well on these types of things"
"

 I'm also autistic and went through a phase when my special interest was standardized testing design"
"I can probably pass most multiple choice tests at a high level even when I don't know the subject, just by knowing how tests are typically written"
"

My testing skills are great"
It doesn't reflect my day-to-day intelligence or understanding of things.
Worth knowing that the inventor of IQ tests was adamant they only be used on individual basises to determine how far behind certain children were
They were never meant to be used to compare and rank people.
"I agree that for most reasons, IQ testing is BS"
"But for some things, quantitatively describing one’s cognitive ability is important"
"And since intelligence is so I’ll defined and cannot be directly measured by looking at the brain, the best thing we can do is come up with qualitative methods that test one’s ability within different areas of cognition"
"

Using IQ as some sort of status symbol or as a certificate of superiority is of course ridiculous"
But it can tell you something about a person’s abilities within certain areas
"If you score high on language parts but lower on problem solving, then that is a pretty good indication that you’re better at semantics and the kind of thinking related to language, and not as good at seeing solutions to certain problems"
"This doesn’t mean you’re either smarter or dumber, but it does say that you are smarter at some things than others."
"To me, intelligence is being able to see deeper connections between different things and being able to abstract"
"

You can be smart and good at something without being highly intelligent"
"

In a strictly formal sense, intelligence is probably defined more as the ability to influence your environment in order to maximize chances of survival, but this is very vague and quickly separates from the colloquial understanding of intelligence."
No he didn’t tell me the score of each section
"Honestly I doubt that my IQ is that low, any lower than that and it would have been an intellectual disability, even my therapist disagreed with the results, anyways   I’m not going to let that get in my head but it did hurt my confidence."
My working memory was surprisingly high
It was 97th if I remember correctly
"The rest were all over 99th percentile.

Then my processing speed was in the 67th"
"

Don't even remember what those other scores were for, just that I had an unexpectedly high (to me at least) working memory score and that hugely outlying processing speed"
"Poor you, get well soon 🙏"
"People with a IQ 75 and lower need help with everyday simple task, and won’t be able to become independent let alone write a well constructed paragraph."
"So only that which is considered academics can be things that make one intelligent? Things that are of abstract nature?

It takes intelligence to be able to fully learn and comprehend a sport and to be able to use one's body in a way that they can perform feats that others can't"
It takes intelligence to be able to read currents and navigate harsh waters
You can have people who cant read who know every in and out of a vehicle and can repair any issue
"Just because it isn't ""STEM"" or other things that are things that are taught at higher learning levels doesn't mean anything.

How are the more concrete things like I mentioned, not things that are marks of being intelligent? How is being smart not being intelligent?"
"I mean, the jump from 97th to 99th percentile is still quite significant in a standardized IQ test though, right?

The 99th percentile would have to be approaching (or over) three standard deviations (145+) from the mean, but the 98th percentile and below puts you at most two standard deviations (130) above average.

Looking at it in terms of compute power, it makes sense to me that you would almost need to have a slower processing speed to perform all the calculations and process all the data required for you to perform in the 99th percentile"
"Especially if you are computing something that can't use parallel execution, and/or that squashes any speculative executions."
"Youre just ok the way you are, hang in there, things will get better 🌟🌺"
"The passive aggressiveness is fair, but understand that I included my test scores only to exemplify how ADHD affects them, which is what OP was asking about...

IQ scores are meaningless in all but the most minute situations"
"Otherwise, what about my IQ would tell you that I'm currently working at the golden arches burger place because it's the only job from which I've not been fired? Nothing"
IQ objectively explains nothing of importance.
"People with adhd also need help with certain ""simple"" tasks"
That doesn't mean they can't write well
But sure I acknowledge iq can affect someone’s ability to write but that doesn't mean that specific ability will be affected so much that it's always going to be something people with low iq can't do
Writing might not be as difficult as a lot of other things
"So that even if your ability to write well is affected, it might still be that you can still write fairly well"
We may simply be overestimating how difficult writing is
It might be that it's easy enough of a skill that many or even most people with those sorts of low IQ scores are still able to do it relatively well.

"I mean, my eyeballs clearly have the *capacity* to see, but I don't think I should feel like guilty for wearing glasses? Or that I'm cheating because I no longer get headaches from squinting all the time.

To be blunt, you have a brain disorder and are taking medication to help treat the symptoms"

P.s"
imo if you were just lazy not getting things done wouldn't bother you
"To me lazy = I could do this l, but don't actually want to and don't care if I don't."
Cheating? 😂Adhd is already a massive disadvantage
Medication is just what can help level the playing field for many with our condition.
"Um, how can it be cheating when other people can do all this without taking it? You’re just getting your brain to do what someone else’s may be able to do without any medication"
You’re probably really smart too and think that you’re intelligent therefore should be able to make yourself do things - but if you could you wouldn’t have ADHD
Try not to worry about it be glad it works for you
I take it and it helps but nowhere near this much!
"I spent the first 46 years of my life on hard mode and it's like someone just showed me there's a toggle where I can switch it to ""normal"" and that everyone else has been playing on that level all along.

I definitely don't feel like I'm cheating, and it's been interesting hearing from non-ADHD friends that what I'm now experiencing has been their experience their entire lives.

Everything in your post is how people without ADHD function for the most part"
The medication helps us get there
"Don't feel guilty about that.

Edit - I'm loving the glasses analogies in this thread."
"I mean, if someone needs to wear glasses to function, do you consider it cheating? Or if someone with paralyzed legs uses a wheelchair? I assume not"

"You just gotta remember all the meds are doing is putting you on a level playing field with everyone else!

Be happy about that!"
No
Not at all
You wouldn't call someone wearing glasses cheating at seeing
You wouldn't call someone on insulin cheating at regulating their blood sugar
You wouldn't call someone with limited mobility cheating for using whatever mobility device they choose cheating at mobility

You can’t do your work without adhd meds because you have adhd.
I heard it put this way: I can’t drive my car with the parking brake on
"Meds remove the brake, but it’s up to me where I choose to go."
"Honestly speaking, Adderall to me now is just like a more effective caffeine with less anxiety."
I think this might be about all the people saying you werent trying hard enough or were lazy or what’s wrong with you…
No I think of it as removing some of the disadvantage I started with.
"IMO the shame comes from decades of people telling you you're not trying hard enough, the perception that taking stimulant meds is a moral failing, and the societal expectation that you min/max your life to be as productive as possible at all times."
"The part of me that felt this way is becoming smaller.

I started taking it 2 months ago and I’m 31"
Now before this I spent 4 good years managing it with behavioral modifications and strategies alone and I got far
But it still wasn’t enough and my own brain biology was still holding me back
"

I see the meds as just another tool in my toolbox and I’m going to use all of the resources I have at my disposal"
"I’ve accepted that I’m not perfect and just like how I use glasses to see, I need some medication to function better and have a better quality of life"
I have cheated in a lot of ways at times just to survive
Not in a screwing other people over way
And I'm not proud
But sometimes you do what you have to to survive in this world the way it works.
It’s it’s cheating to leave on time for work instead of being paralyzed with dread on my bed I don’t want to play fair.
Then run 14 miles everyday like David Goggins and do away with the meds!!
NO
"Fucks sake.
Are you cheating having a headache by taking Tylenol? Come on"
Take your meds
Take care of yourself
Be grateful you have access to these meds
Many do not.
"Cheating = playing dishonestly, breaking the rules"
"Getting treatment for a disorder which dramatically affects functioning in multiple life domains (personal relationships, mental health outcomes, health outcomes, car accidents, etc) is fair and square."
What exactly are we cheating at? At whose expense are we cheating if we take meds?
Nope!
Nah!
No
"yes i do feel the guilt :( 

just remind yourself that it’s your medication and you need it to function like everybody else"
if other people are lazier/less productive it’s their problem but you cannot control not being able to do as much things
You are allowed to enjoy your life and feel good sometimes.
"So it’s cheating to take medication to help yourself progress in life ? Literally delusional dude, what kind of question is this."
Not at all
"First half of my life has been hell, with Vyvanse I have a fighting chance, which is helping me fix the aftermath.

It’s also not a free lunch"
There are side effects
"We’re paying for it, cost and health.

Vyvanse allows my consciousness to move from within my head out my eyeballs, like glasses"
I’m not going to feel guilty for improving my life because I can see the chalkboard that everyone else was already able.
No
"

I get so tired of people moralizing medications and medical procedures"
 Anyone who does can fuck off.
lol no
Do you feel like you’re cheating if you need glasses to see and wear them? Same concept.
"Is a paraplegic person cheating by using a wheelchair?

That's what this post sounds like to me."
I'm sorry to say but your brain does NOT have the capacity to do it
"If it did, you'd have done it already without the vyvanse"
Your brain has the capacity to do your work WHEN YOU ARE RECEIVING TREATMENT FOR YOUR DISABILITY
"

Let me repeat: you have a disability"
You are disabled
You cannot function in the same capacity that other people can without adequate support
"

If you have really bad vision and you don't wear glasses, you are not functioning as well as other people because your eyes don't work"
"If you wear glasses and suddenly you're not bumping into things and you can read all the street signs, you're not cheating, you're using a medical device to compensate for your bad eyes."
"Fuck no, LMAO 😂😭"
"I've never felt guilty of having to take stimulant medication (Dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) for life 💪🏽)

For once in my life (for context, it wasn't until a little more than a year ago that I got evaluated and diagnosed with ADHD and I deeply regret that I didn't get diagnosed sooner) I actually feel functional and even then if I go a day or so without my stimulant prescription I return back to square one"
"

If anything, stimulants at their best have put me somewhat par on par with those without ADHD in terms of focusing and with execution of tasks and yet I'm still outperformed."
Not even
I quite enjoy the brief windows of clarity and communication that they provide
"We're all just chemicals, living inside of chemicals"
"Oxygen has an odor, but we'd never know"
"Thanks, Adderall."
"Related question, for those that used stimulants like Ritalin then moved to Vyvanse, was there a difference? I'm currently on Ritalin but I've maxed my tolerance on my current dose and I don't want to increase the dosage every time my tolerance builds up, so I'm curious if vyvanse works differently for those that had success with Ritalin."
No not at all
"Your brain clearly does not have the capacity normally, if it did, then these meds would not work the way they do"
Other people have the sneaky trick of their brain already producing the chemicals it's supposed to and doing what it's supposed to do
"Like how most people produce their own insulin, but some people have to take insulin to not die instead"
"
 is it so weird to me that you literally think the same as me"
I think it's more like do ppl really have the capacity to do all the shit they need to without the help of this drug
I can't fathom it in my head bc we need meds so it's just crazy bc I feel like it's not possible
"

But I also feel like nonadhd ppl prob never question how hard we struggle so"
No why would I when it helps me function 😂
I never felt guilty for using Vyvanse but it kind of felt like cheating when playing video games because it felt like I had superhuman reflexes and focus
Absolutely not because we’re at an unfair disadvantage in the first place
The meds just bring us to the same level as everyone else
Absolutely not
My meds make me feel normal
No way
"I did life on hard mode for 40 years, almost keeping up with people who did the same things effortlessly"
It's my turn to fly.
Nah if you have an illness you take medicine to help with the impact
My brain needs support in this societal structure
So no
It’s not you or your ADHD
What makes ADHD hard is the structure of our economy and society
"""Are people struggling to breathe cheating by using a ventilator or asthma medication?"""
"No, because even when I take my prescribed medication for my neuro-developmental disorder, I still struggle"
"My life is a struggle and my meds help me less of a hot mess, they don’t turn me into a superhuman."
Someone with a broken leg isn’t cheating because they have a crutch
Success looks different to all of us and some of us need help to make it easier to be successful.
"At this point, I don't care if I'm cheating or not"
"There was a conversation I had with my step dad where he was telling me I had to ""get it together"" in so many words because I wouldn't be able to rely on it forever"
I quickly corrected him saying that I was on this for the rest of my life
"Why? Because as my husband perfectly said, ""I'm sorry you need meds to make your brain work."" 

Vyvance has helped me feel like my head is on straight, I'm able to look at things from more of a logical approach and I'm more chill"
I can breathe
"Yes, I'm able to feel like I can actually learn on it, but it's so much more"
"If you ask me, those gosh darn normal brain folks are the ones who are cheating."
"I've actually dropped my wallet, looked at it, got distracted, and forgotten to pick it up"
"this has happened dozens of times through the past ten years.

no, I don't feel like I'm cheating for taking something that helps me function like a human"
zero guilt
"

I'm not getting high"
"I've taken double doses before (not on purpose) and I can't imagine a situation where I could feasibly ""abuse"" it and not feel like I was going to have a heart attack."
"Cheating? 

Cheating implies that the contest was setup with rules and is fair for all parties"
"


This is life, play the hand you're delt, use whatever you can to get ahead(without fucking over good people).


Edit: thanks for reminding me to take my meds."
"Short answer, no 
Long answer, noooooooo"
No
I feel cheated that I wasn't on it growing up bc I would be in a very different place had I been medicated properly  throughout my life.
I spent 33 years without it
"Fuck that, I'm not cheating by taking a chance to feel normal."
I have felt this way from time to time
But I know that I am best when I take my medicine and it’s not a moral issue.
Not at all
"ADHD has dragged me down my entire life, especially as I have gotten older"
The meds just bring me closer to normal.
"No, it doesn't even bring me up to a normal person's level"
"I would happily cheat if I could, give me something that allows me to function at work and at home, and I'll take it and be called a druggy for all I care"
I just want to not be drowning.
The glasses analogy is pretty elegant
" Would you consider it cheating if a formula 1 racer with visual impairments wore glasses?  Probably not, that person would require them to perform on equal grounds against racers without such impairments."
Helllllo no.
Seems to me like you view it as you and your coworkers all starting at the same level so with that logic your meds would give you an advantage ..
Up until now you were at a disadvantage and the meds basically only even out your starting points
"Don't worry, I was also surprised at how easy everything felt and then I was mad that for 30 years no one told me it could be this easy"
Now I'm just proud of what I can really do when given access to my full potential and you should be too
"Clearly you are much more capable than you ever imagined, that is wonderful news ;)"
No
"No I don't, because without it my life would be terrible"
"I take 30 mg total of instant release Ritalin during the afternoon, and I take a high dose in the morning"
It's about brain types
🧠 it slows my brain down emensely and makes me feel normal.
No guilt—we’ve had enough of that!
HELL NO it levels the playing field and also makes some stuff much harder
"Nuh man , it’s improved my life by a lot don’t get me wrong but I don’t think I’m where I would be if I just didn’t have this condition to begin with"
"I feel exactly the same, thanks for sharing it"
It's nice to know that you're not alone
"I’m the same age, and I was also recently diagnosed and prescribed medication"
"These past two weeks, work got completely out of control"
"In the past, my anxiety from freezing up—what I now recognize as ADHD paralysis—would send me spiraling, often provoking panic attacks"
"One of those even landed me in the ER, and I ultimately had to quit my job.

I was fully expecting that to happen again, but as the week comes to a close, I find myself thinking… I did it? And a lot of it was because of this pill? Am I cheating? I can now speak up during meetings, advocate for myself, and follow through with deadlines with less friction than ever before in my life.

The thing is, you deserve the chance to feel this way too—just as much as I do"
Many people naturally function like this without medication
"If taking medication allows you to pursue your goals, stay financially stable, or simply feel more present in your life, then that’s okay.

I’m still grappling with some guilt, but I’m hopeful that the benefits outweigh the shame or imposter syndrome that can come with it."
I'm not cheating by using Adderall to make my brain work better the same way I'm not cheating by wearing my glasses to see better
"You aren't cheating either, you're just able to be more functional with the meds, and that's okay."
That's like saying I cheated when I got my finger amputated because I took pain meds
Not in the slightest
No
Youre not cheating If you have a chemical imbalance that can be fixed
You wouldn't say that about someone on anti depression meds or bipolar meds
I feel this whole heartedly
Dont beat yourself up for finally being able to function like normal people.
No
 Not at all
 I feel like I’ve BEEN cheated most of my life until I finally took a medication that allowed me to function like everyone else
" Because before meds, I couldn’t."
i feel like i cheat myself when i don’t take them :(
No
I feel like the wind is finally at my back as opposed to walking into it.
It's not cheating - your medication is helping you to overcome hurdles and perform at your TRUE full potential.
I feel like there’s a class i missed when joining this sub that tells you exactly how to respond to peoples common questions lol
"But anyways, I don’t think its as black and white as most here are suggesting"
I think it is entirely possible that some of us are overcompensating
"Probably not intentionally, but its not reasonable to expect everyone is going to have the perfect magic dose to put them on an even playing field with others"
"That said, any overcompensating may provide an edge with some things (e.g"
"getting up in the morning), but if others are like me, the ADHD symptoms still cause problems medicated or not, so the trade off of any “advantages” is still a net loss."
You may be dealing with something called “imposter syndrome” common in adhd individuals including myself
You deserve to be on an even playing field as others and that’s all the medicine is doing
"

For me getting diagnosed and medicated was like putting on reading glasses"
"I felt like you, that the significant improvement was like cheating, things were so much easier it feels like cheating"
But in reality I was working harder than others before medication.
"Why?! Not at all, all my life I suffered because of my ADHD/autism, now I'm having some sort of a ""normal"" day I'm not going to feel guilty about it one bit"
The only feelings I have is anger and grief and thinking my life could have been like this if I was on meds years ago.
Yup
I often feel guilty
Also when I’m not on the meds I tell myself I’m lazy
And inattentive
"I didn’t get diagnosed till I was 52, so I’m also a repeat failure.

… it’s been the main work of my last three years telling all those false narratives to shut the f up…"
The glasses analogy is spot on
"As someone who wears glasses and takes vyvanse, taking the pill before you look for your glasses helps a lot ;)"
Nah
"
The medicine evens the playing field."
"I'm on Vyvanse too, I was lucky that my psychiatrist is awesome and explained how it would work, for me to decide what I wanted and asked my opinion knowing full well what all the meds would do and I said ""yep, that one"".

We started slow then realised I'm like a hippo when it comes to meds so I went to 70mg"
"

I miss it the days I don't have it"
"When I do have it, I feel like a fuller version of me"
"It's not some mysterious cheat code to get through life, it's levelling up to the playing field you are supposed to be on."
No
I deserve medication as much as the next guy.
"This is imposter syndrome, and it (often) comes from years of living without treatment"
" You say ""clearly my brain is capable."" Yes, but only when treated with medication"
You've done the experiment already
"I have no doubt you tried your absolute hardest without and until medication, and still you struggled"
That's the condition
"I did the experiment, too, friend.

Think of the eyeglasses example, I'm sure someone will post it"
"People who wear glasses aren't ""cheating""; their vision is corrected"
Their eyes are capable of seeing clearly: once corrected with a prescription
"

You've got this!"
You don't get a medal for struggling through life
You're not cheating
nope
never
i need all the help i can get
i relate to you so much..
i recently started elvanse (basically vyvanse in the UK) and it genuinely changed my life like I'm able to go through with basic daily tasks without rotting in bed for 3 hrs prior
I'm a uni student and its helping me with my lectures and assignment so much
"On days I don't take it, I just lie in bed lifeless and it makes me cry because it makes me feel like I've developed a dependency on medication.

I talked to my boyfriend abt this, (who initially was against me taking meds bcuz he thought id get addicted 😭) and he told me that there's no shame in depending on meds because he knows its hard for me without them"
"He's seen me before and after I started meds, he saw me be happy with being able to function like a normal person with meds"
"He told me that if it helps me, then I shouldn't feel bad about using meds to get things done"
"

I'd say the same to you, there's no shame in taking medication if it helps you because that is the point of taking it."
"That's like saying a person who has terrible vision is cheating with glasses, or a person who is paralyzed is cheating with a wheelchair, nah man, we're just trying to catch up to average lol."
I think of feeling guilt as blaming myself or considering myself at fault for something
"However, I know that being AuDHD is not my fault and that taking medication really helps me with most things"
"Therefore, it's not my fault that I need medication, so I shouldn't feel guilty about using it"
"I didn't **choose** to need it, so why feel guilty about something I had no control over?"
Cheating?
My ADHD is an open secret at work and medication is a tool I've been prescribed
"When I have it and use it right, it helps my performance."
I don't
"I'm grateful for whatever ADHD stimulant works, because even if it is cheating, it's a hell of a lot better than sitting at my desk staring at my computer like a zombie because I'm unable to start any task."
One way that had helped me come to terms with it: You should feel as guilty as someone that cannot use their legs would feel for using a wheelchair
It’s a disability
Just because it’s not as physically visible doesn’t mean it’s less valid.
Nah
"You were dealt a shitty hand in the card game that is life, for fuck's sake just let yourself have some relief from the suffering of untreated ADHD"
The medicine helped your brain function more like it's supposed to after decades of hindering you
Take joy in it! There's no cheating going on
Anyone who is talking to you that way doesn't have your interests in mind.
Medication is a tool
"Do you feel guilty using an electric drill instead of a hand drill? It's the same concept, really.

gg getting meds!"
Hell no
My meds hardly help me function like the average (non-AuDHD) person and i’m on the highest dose
"So, not even close to cheating, as I’m *still* at a frustrating disadvantage despite meds and other coping tools."
I don’t
I can’t function
I missed a shit tonne of important things this week b/c I forgot to take my meds
"A lot of other things that come with adhd are depression, compulsion, impulsion, etc., so depending on what’s in combination with your condition, there could be bouts of moments you feel bad"
My depression is a big component of my adhd
I’m not at all useful without my meds
I’ve accepted this.
No
no
"It ain't cheating, it's how we were supposed to be!"
Do people with high blood pressure feel guilty about taking their meds?  Consider your own take on your condition
 ADHD is a developmental disability plain and simple
 Some of us have more severe cases which require medication.
"NO

Except that I do feel guilty in one situation at work"
There's a struggling new associate who I think has ADHD
"I'd like to be able to talk to him openly about it: share the fact that I have ADHD and encourage him to get tested, and then medicated if necessary"
"But we don't work together, and that kind of conversation requires a high degree of trust."
Hell no this isn’t cheating it’s being on par with everyone else
We are playing the game on hard mode with proper treatment we can run it on normal or easy like the rest of the people do
Are glasses users cheating when they wear glasses or contacts?
Don't feel guilty about finally having an experience similar to everyone else
Don't worry
You have plenty of years ahead of you to have moments of laziness and insecurity.
That shock will fade in a few months and the side effects will lessen
"Once you see if the med is a good match long term and you settle on an effective dose you will barely notice the effects anymore but still have great focus, less distraction, and maybe more stable frustration tolerance"
Then you will miss your first dose at some point and it will be another shock to your system as symptoms come back and remind you why you sought treatment
It’s normal to feel that way and it will probably resolve on its own
I’m on vyvanse 30mg and know exactly what you’re saying.
"I don't feel guilty taking dayquil, wearing glasses, or eating food I didn't hunt"
Why would I feel bac about using any modern advancement to help myself function?
Does a heart patient feel guilty because he has a pace maker?? Or a hearing impaired person feel guilty using a hearing aid?
Would you feel guilty for taking thyroid medication? Medication for diabetes?
"Why would I ? I don’t feel like cheating when I use my contact lenses or glasses, or taking fibre supplements when I need them"
"Same with using caffeine/preworkouts/pl protein shakes 

It helps you function in this late stage capitalistic hellhole we live in"
Ain’t nothing cheating about that
Kidney transplant patient here w adhd inattentive type.
would I skip my kidney transplant meds for feeling like I’m cheating ? TF! Same goes w my adhd meds ..
Do you feel like you’re cheating when you take other medicine?
"Na, you’ve just been living on hard mode."
I feel like my weight loss on Vyvanse is kinda “cheating” but I have no hangups about using ADHD meds for my ADHD
"I function better with them, I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD by professionals and prescribed the meds by professionals… why feel bad that I need a medication someone else doesn’t need?"
You are not going to win any prizes for getting through life with more or less difficulty
"All people care about is how you show up for them, whether it's at work, home or elsewhere"
Take/do whatever you need to give your best in the areas of your life that are important to you.
If we believe ADHD is a real biology based condition (which sometimes I wonder if people here do) then of course it’s not cheating
" It’s like saying shouldn’t wear glasses because they can’t see, or diabetics are cheating if they take metformin"
 Should we develop habits and not use ADHD to shield us from taking responsibility for our behaviours- yes as well
 But there’s some basic assumptions here that I don’t think people are on the same page about.
I don’t think it’s cheating
Before being medicated I wasn’t a good partner I wasn’t a good mom and I wasn’t a good friend
And I was constantly consumed by the guilt of feeling like I’m failing
To the point where I don’t think I was gonna stick around much longer because every day felt so overwhelming
"So no, I don’t think meds are cheating I think they are saving your life if used the right way"
And if truly needed.
Nope
I’m using my medication at the prescribed dose for what it’s meant for and it’s been a life saver for me
If anything I feel cheated for the decades I had to mask and let life shaft me with no lube before I was diagnosed.
"Not quite in that way.

I do get imposter feelings though, and i think that's kinda whats hitting you?

For me I sometimes fear that I kind of don't have ADHD and that vyvanse is not a medication but a drug i abuse for my own comfort.

But it's important to understand that even though these thoughts are valid in a sense, it's a thought and not the truth"
People who know more medically than me diagnosed me with ADHD
"I have ADHD, it's not something I made up"
The meds are here to help me function similarily to a Non-ADHD person
"Similarily I would argue you are not ""cheating"" you are lowering the hurdles on your own path - probably to a similar level other people experience.

If you are lazy Vyvanse is not gonna fix the issue"
It doesn't miracly solve everything
But gives you options.
"I always could get my work done very quickly, even before Vyvanse"
"I just couldn't make myself do it when I should.

ADHD expert Dr"
"Ned Hallowell gave a talk at my job, he has ADHD himself and described the ADHD mind as ""a Ferrari with bicycle brakes.""

The meds are just fitting yourself with the correct brakes so you can take corners (i.e"
change direction/task) without yeeting yourself into a ditch (executive dysfunction paralysis/procrastination).
"My old friends would rip on me for taking vyvanse for our chess tournaments, kind of made me feel guilty about it but it’s not my fault that I need a pill to be able to function “normally”"
"i would absolutely not feel guilty if i could get it, i'm jealous!"
Everyone around you is cheating
"Our economy businesses and government is run by grifters, cheaters, abusers, and people who don't follow rules.

We live in the golden age of scams"
"

Why not cheat? why not take every advantage you can get? why not love yourself enough to cheat? 

**You deserve to cheat at life and to enjoy the fruits of the cheating.**"
I don't understand this question
Does a diabetic feel guilty for taking insulin or that they're cheating life?
But..
why? This is a therapy question if anything
"You wouldn't feel guilty if you needed glasses or insulin.

>I don’t know why I cant do my work without it since clearly my brain does have the capacity to do it.

Frankly, no you don't have that ability; you have ADHD"
The part of your brain that makes you get up and do a task is disordered
"You might feel better learning more about the brain differences of ADHD, because you're speaking awfully flippantly"
"The skills that complete your actual tasks are a different part of your brain than the ones handling executive functioning, and without executive functioning nothing else gets done."
"If you just started taking it, take advantage of how well it’s currently working for you"
"Get all your ducks in order, finances, social life, home life and learn all the things you’ve been putting off or having been able to dive deeply into due to inconsistent motivation and lack of concentration"
The medication doesn’t work as well years down the road
"I had the same feelings as you at first, and now I wonder if it’s actually doing more harm than good and wish I for example backtrack filed my taxes when I was at peak efficiency"
(I’m a triple citizen and maybe a little dyslexic too so taxes are extra confusing for me)
I wish I tackled that year 1 of taking stimulants
"I did learn about nutrition for example and used my high motivation state to really practice meal prepping, cooking and knowing what foods I have sensitivities to, which I’m very grateful for today because I can now do those things effortlessly with or without stimulants)"
"It’s not cheating, you owe it to yourself"
"Enjoy this time, do all the things, and think of it like any other medication one may take for any other illness"
You would never tell a diabetic that taking insulin is cheating for example
Or someone with allergies to not take an antihistamine
Hope this helps
Take care!
It's not cheating
"Sometimes it barely makes you average, compared to other people"
Other people just wake up average or excellent
No meds needed
Maybe therapy to help you get a better perspective?
"I feel like the better way of putting this would be ""imposter syndrome.""

I stopped feeling guilty about it almost two weeks into taking my Adderall"
"

If anything, it just makes me sad"
My entire life before being medicated was essentially dominated by my ADHD
"I lost wonderful opportunities, and the challenges back then wouldn't of been as daunting"
"Maybe I would've actually finished school, or stayed in that job, etc"
"

But, now I have the crutches my brain needed to help me get up and actually achieve those goals I've had for so many years"
"

I'm just grateful that I had the resources and support when things were coming to an impasse, and someone said, ""okay"
"Let's try and fix it."""
"I don't see it as cheating, more like leveling the playing field"
I want to do these things and often try as hard/much as I can but I can't quite do them to the same level as others because ADHD impairs me in one or more ways to keep me from performing at the same level that I can when I am receiving treatment for the impairments
Do you consider contacts or glasses cheating? It isn't the exact same stuff but I think it is a pretty good metaphor.
I’m angry that no one noticed I had problems until I was an adult and I noticed I was struggling
I was smart enough to get through school but oh my god I could’ve actually done well in school and learned stuff and still had fun with friends and not been stressed and burnt out
"Glad I have meds now but yeah definitely not cheating, if anything everyone else is cheating life by not having to struggle as much as ADHD people do"
"

But yeah also I’ve been wearing glasses since I was a kid, that’s not cheating at life—even with the glasses my vision isn’t perfect"
"

It’s ok to have medical problems, fortunately there’s a lot of tools, like meds and glasses, now to help with them!"
"No, I don’t feel any guilt at all about taking Vyvanse"
"I also don’t feel any guilt about taking birth control so I don’t get pregnant, and I don’t feel any guilt about taking estrogen to alleviate my perimenopause symptoms"
"

ADHD is a neurological difference and is therefore morally neutral"
"Once you stop attaching morality to how your brain works, you can start living your life."
"The only time I feel like I'm cheating is because I feel so energy boosted and everyone else doesn't? But at the  same time, I almost feel guilty for taking the meds, because I know I'll get looked down on"
Because I can't do things normally
Is that what you mean? I don't classify that as cheating though
"It's like I don't feel bad, but I know society looks at me badly"
"Heck, even my own family would."
Harrison Bergeron by Kurt Vonnegut comes to mind…
"No, because my husband is the most normal brained individual I have ever met"
He wakes up early with no alarm and gets right out of bed to start the day
I have never seen anyone with so much continuous motivation
"It's almost annoying, but that's just my jealousy talking"
"So to know that some people are just wired different, I don't feel guilty needing a substance to make me function properly"
"I wish I didn't have to, but I'm thankful that there is something that helps me."
"No, because I can barely function without it"
"Like 15%, maybe? On meds, I'm at least 50-65% functioning."
Please don't feel guilty for using your meds
"Completely understandable that the change is so shocking and the feeling of ""wow I feel completely normal but I can *focus* now"" is wonderful"
"

It's a med, meds are noticeable, but as others have said, ADHD is a disability"
"You're not a bad person for using a medical method to help with your disability, the same way a physically disabled person is not bad for using tools to help them function."
How is this cheating? Am I cheating when I take all my meds? I guess I'm cheating death at that point.
"No, if anything I feel cheatED that I don’t more naturally have what these medications provide neurologically"
 I view those meds like I do my contact lenses - assistance I need in order to get close to baseline normalcy
" Would I prefer not to need it? Yup, that’d be great lol, but I don’t have that option"
" My only option is either be my naturally dysfunctional self, or supplement my brain with medication that helps it sometimes reach its potential."
We already starting off on the back foot without medication
See it as levelling the playing field during the window the medication is active in our system
Diagnosed earlier this year at 33.
Man I *WISH* any medication did this for me
Congrats!
"It’s not cheating, it’s support for your disability that allows you to be able to function like everyone else and have equal access to the same opportunities."
I always have this shame
Once I dig deep into it I realize it's because I hate having a disability and that's not fair to myself
"Again, we wear glasses for disabilities and take insulin for diabetes and use wheelchairs for mobility and anti seizure medications for epilepsy"
It's no different than
Nah
"The world is cheating, I'm just balancing the odds a bit."
I do not
Just like I’m sure the rest of the world does t feel guilty getting a boost from a coffee instead of “earning” that natural energy by vigorous exercise or labor
"
Life’s way too short"
Don’t beat yourself up
This is like any other med
"

A coworker balked at my diagnosis and said “I don’t t buy that everyone has a little adhd “

Can you imagine if I clapped back with “I dont think you need to take an antidepressant, everyone is a little sad” 

I WOULD NEVER! But there will always be a critic"
Don’t be your own 💛
I wear glasses and I have inattentive ADHD
I wear glasses because my eyeballs are shaped a little funny and needs a bit of help through no fault of my own
"

My brain needs glasses aka medication, because it works a little funny through no fault of my own"
"

Easy does it and be kind to yourself"
"

Proud of you for seeking help."
"Nah, if I was cheating, I'd be way more successful"
Taking a prescribed treatment for a known condition so that I can unload the dishwasher is definitely not cheating.
"that's that feel shame for using a wheel chair because your legs don't work.We don't get a boost from the meds, we get a boost from ADHD, the meds just allow us to actually use our ADHD."
My therapist said once: “do you think that diabetics feel that way about insulin? Does your mom feel that way about her inhaler? No
No they don’t
 It’s medicine
Period.”
I feel guilty for not posting sooner
I will be 70 in a few weeks and Adderall is a game changer for me
Over 15 years 30 mgm twice a day
Only side effects are depression if I skip doses on weekends.
No
Only when running at lunch with my coworker
"I can tell it gives me a boost and makes running easier.

Otherwise no"
I have a brain that makes me want to sleep most of the day when I need to be awake and makes it hard to do basic tasks like folding the laundry
I feel it almost levels the playing field.
"No, I don’t feel guilty because without them I struggle with depression and bingeing in addition to my adhd"
I feel like I’m finally on the same playing field as everyone else when I take my meds.
"So… stimulants make it so you pretty much
Can do what every other non-ADHD person in the world can do"
 Mate.
"you’re not cheating, you just stopped running the race with 2 anchors and a safe weighting you down."
Medication is merely the key that opens the locked door of your brain
"You are most yourself on the medication as you have access to your whole functioning brain.

Never once have I felt guilty"
I feel incredibly grateful that I have a key as I was locked in darkness for so long.
"Nope, I struggled too much unmediated and undiagnosed"
"

Life’s too short as it is and honestly I think it levels the playing field"
"

Went from failing in retail to finding a career when I got diagnosed and medicated.

I felt more guilt trying and failing to be a husband, father and employee when I was undiagnosed.

That being said, it’s complex and imposter syndrome is real.

You deserve to get help, be happy and try to carve a path forward"
Don’t diminish your worth because it took medication to realize this.
A person who takes medication for their mental health and needs is no more cheating than a person who walks with a cane.
Using crutches to walk is not cheating
"It just levels the playing field where most people can walk normally without crutches now u can walk too.

The only way u feel guilty or cheating is when u do not have ADHD but using the ADHD medications to have an extra advantage than the normal people."
No if anything I feel angry I wasn’t diagnosed decades sooner
Not a single bit
"Keep in Mind I was taking Vyvanse since I was 3, I was barely conscious back then"
So I never really git ti experience the instant light switch I can focus now feeling
Tolerance builds up over 15 years
Even with taking Adderall on top of Vyvanse for my job I don't have that happen
I'm honestly kind of jealous of people who do experience it.
No
I went almost 5 years without meds due to pregnancy/breastfeeding and just finally got back on my meds and it has been life changing
I was struggling bad but no one would prescribe me meds (I have no history of abuse they just didn’t think I should bc I was breastfeeding) and I am still breastfeeding but finally found a doc who is educated on the topic
"

I take a very low dose but I’ve actually been able to keep up with some basic tasks and haven’t been spiraling with anxious racing thoughts for the first time in years"
"

It’s not cheating bc I was at a disadvantage to begin with"
ADHD is a disability and the world is not accommodating to our disability
Those meds help make things more accessible
"They are leveling the playing field, not providing an unfair advantage."
Nope
It helps me be a better me.
No
"At worst, I feel annoyed and sad that I need medication to feel at least kind of normal"
"Ultimately it doesn't do *that* much for me, but it does help."
I felt this to the point that I stopped taking it
"About 15 years later when I was struggling to write an email, I got re-tested"
"While I was in the top percentile of almost every metric, I was in the absolute bottom for others"
The person giving me the test said it was good that I got extra time in high school and medication
That freed me of the guilt
The medication and the accommodations are about evening the playing field for those who would be at a disadvantage otherwise.
Noo??? Girll wtfff
You’re cheating your lifespan and body
These drugs cause lasting harm when used for years
Thank you for this response
I think the shame Im feeling is that finally something is coming easy to me and Im not used to that!
I just came here to write what you did lol
I find the comparison to wearing glasses super helpful in examining how we look at and talk about medication
Do I wish I could just see without glasses? Of course
"Other people can see but I can’t and that’s not a choice I made, it’s what my eyes are"
Am I dependent on my glasses? Yes
"It would be dangerous to drive without them  I literally could not function, so I don’t think “dependency” is a bad thing"
"Have I increased the strength of my prescription? Yes, but not by choice, that’s just how my eyes changed as I got older"
It’s not like I’m seeking out stronger glasses for no reason
A doctor prescribes them
"

Also if I went to a doctor and they suggested I try to go without my glasses or make do with weaker glasses, I would find a new doctor because that’s not how eyes work"
"

Obviously there are people who abuse adhd meds, but if you have ADHD and you’re seeing a doctor, you are not cheating or weak"
You’re treating a difference in your brain that allows you to function in the world.
"As a guy with a glasses, I approve this"
Great logic!
Damn youre right!
Most of the matches i win in SC6 are because of my ability to quickly recognize the patterns in the other person's attacks(it's not all downsides)
I initially thought of it as cheating too
"After thinking about that, it does feel more like having your other hand suddenly free though"
Took me a moment to realise what sort of handicap I was running around with for decades.
Nobody thinks wearing glasses is cheating if you're shortsighted
Thank you so much! Appreciate this response more than you could know
100% agreed
It always hurt seeing how easy things came to kids at school
And at work it just kept getting worse
Im glad you resolved it
Nailed it
Thank you!!
That’s really kind of you and I will take it to heart
Thank you!
"While I love all these thoughtful lengthy responses, this is the only word I needed to hear :)"
I think where some of this comes from is that so many people casually say they have it but arent serious about it
"So when I talk to my psychiatrist or tell close friends, I feel like just another person saying they have it"
"
I need to get over that discomfort!"
💯
It’s new feeling like things come easy to me
Like I dont deserve this sudden improvement
"I need to work on that, but what a lovely problem to have!"
Thank you! I just followed this group and feel emotional hearing real experiences with adhd and not from people who use it as a personality quirk
Absolutely a part of it
Emotionally devastating in hindsight
It’s crazy starting this much later in life
"Im glad I dont feel alone on this, and glad neither of us are accepting this guilt as a valid feeling"
Great outlook
Thank you!
"I tried dozens of different adhd medications for years, and I seem resistant to all of them"
"I have very severe blatant ADHD symptoms, to the point random strangers suggest ADHD medicines to me, but I don't know what to do next since I've already tried all the medications on the market with no improvements"
The only thing I seem to get from ADHD meds is anxiety and insomnia.
"Many people use this as a rule of thumb for laziness: If you feel guilty about potentially being lazy, you aren't truly lazy; it's just your executive dysfunction, which isn't your fault"
"While some have strong executive function instinctively, others struggle with basic tasks"
"It is what it is, and medication can be beneficial"
"I hope you can overcome this mindset, as breaking free from negative repetitive thoughts about yourself can be challenging"
Good luck OP!
"Thank you for responding and happy almost bday! Did you start recently? If so, what made you decide to start? I dont know my longterm plan yet so curious if Ill need it when Im closer to your age."
"The mortality risk of living with untreated adhd is higher than the risk associated with long term use of stimulant medication, with exceptions for people with serious preexisting cardiac conditions."
"Please post a picture of your psychiatric medical degree and practice history, as well as links to all your peer-reviewed publications.

If you can't do any of that, stop spouting off your uneducated drivel."
Yup
You were living on hard mode.
I’m 48 got diagnosed 18 months ago and on adderall here in uk it’s made a huge difference to my working habits and to my relationship
"I see it as comment OP said.

The other thing is I tend to have weekends off the meds so I can feel a bit more lose"
It works for me but have no idea if it’s a common practise or not helps me stay in touch with my sense of “real me” if that makes sense
You're not cheating you just leveled the playing field
You're no longer working around ticking time bombs and watching out for mines at every step
You're now able to work like our brains should
We're playing this game on hard mode is the best way put really
same lol
"Well said, I'm saving your comment for future reference!"
Often we ADHD folk are prone to feeling excess guilt or shame
I understand why you'd feel this way.
You’ve gotten some great responses already but I haven’t seen anyone mention not wanting to tell your doctor because you don’t want them to think you’re dependent on it
If a doctor thinks that or gets judgmental for any reason then get a new doctor
They prescribed it to you because they thought it would help
They aren’t going to take it away just because it’s working.
You're allowed to use tools that help you!
ADHD is absolutely a spectrum
For some people it's more annoying than debilitating
"I'm on the more severe side of things, I can't function without my meds"
But I have friends that just skip meds all the time and it doesn't seem to make that big of an impact for them
Like they're chronically late and messy either way so it's whatever for them.
"Yeah, i only got medicated earlier this year, and it’s incredible! I get up and do the things I know need to get done"
I don’t have that huge mental barrier to get started on things that don’t have instant gratification
I enjoy the journey and I actually apply myself
I’ve never understood how people could do that.
Many people do not feel well on weekends if they decide to skip their medication on those days
" Mainly mood issues, fatigue, or headaches"
" I'm not a doctor, but if not taking the meds on weekends works for you, I wouldn't change that"
" Especially if you have been on Adderall for 18 months.

I follow this subreddit kinda closely, and have learned a  learned even more from other sources about medications, ADHD, neurodicergence, and the whole lot of it all since I was diagnosed in 2020.

One thing that is very apparent is that people that have diagnosed ADHD present symptoms in many ways, and the medications affect everyone differently.

Finding what works for you, if you are lucky enough to, and sticking with that seems like the best way to go about dealing with the condition.

.."
And unfortunately things that once worked don't work forever for some people
 It is extremely complicated.
"Yea I haven’t had any adverse symptoms so far, it’s something I’ve started doing fairly recently, and then continued on a recent trip to New Orleans where tbh I was stimulated enough and didn’t really want to be focused!"
"That totally makes sense.

For me, it's more like I want to be able to focus on what is important instead of random nonsense, even while on vacation."

Your dad understands you more than what you think he does
Just tell him how you're feeling and you will see.
Don't beat yourself up too much
Stuff happens and I'm sure your dad understands
"After all, he didn't have to starve, there was food in the house to make"
Maybe set a reminder on your phone next time or try to go buy food (or whatever task) before you start drawing

Ohhh
"That’s a horrible feeling, poor you"
"

But also poor your-dad"
"He was expecting a chore to be done for him, to make his life easier & more pleasant, but ended up having to do a worse version for himself"
"

So making it up to him (& to yourself, because it will help you to feel capable again, which is important!) would probably look like doing an equivalent amount of chores for him this weekend (or as soon as possible)"
"

Is there something that he regularly does around the house, that you could do instead of him?

Maybe that’s laundry, or doing the food shop, or cleaning the bathrooms…?  

Something that gives him 1-2 hours back in his day"
"

Bonus points - if you don’t currently have many responsibilities around the house - maybe you could set yourself a fun challenge of trying to notice one thing per week that would make your dad or mum's life easier"

People that are *actually* stupid don't even stop to think whether or not they're stupid
"They just live through life perseverating in mind like prisoners to their own impulses and judging and disparaging others along the way.

The fact that you are here deliberating in mind about your own intellect and have to explain to yourself why you think you are not stupid is probably a sign of past trauma"
Not your fault
It's natural to feel this way after being treated unfairly

To be honest, most of the polymaths in the world are probably ADHD, I think people with ADHD despite the setbacks are the best all-rounders in the world"

If you can afford it, I'd recommend seeing a therapist who's familiar with ADHD."
Your partner should be supporting you
It’s not you that’s being stupid.
My husband and son are both adhd
"Do they drive me mad with their crazy logic, forgetfulness, time blindnes, messiness"
Absolutely
Do I get frustrated and short tempered sometimes because of it
Absolutely
"
Do I still love them both completely"
Hell yes

It’s hard being a partner of a person with adhd, and he has to forgive me my deep breaths and sighs when things ‘aren’t right’"
But i love him for all the chaos he brings as well

"I'm happy to hear you're having positive effects so far!:) I definitely underestimated how much my body would get used to the medication, even though I was warned beforehand"
"I still benefit alot from them, but it set me back a bit when I started having to try a bit harder to keep my structures in place"
"Staying as active as possible and making sure you're eating enough will help in many aspects, I promise! 

(Recently, Ive been using a accountability/productivity app called ""finch"", it's so goddamn cute and often just having a list of things I should be doing with a little bird that relies on me to do those things is enough to help me get started.)"
"Do the thing that everyone tells you to do! Do the useless ""get a planner"" thing! It doesn't work for shit when ur unmedicated but when you are medicated it actually helps!"
Biggest advice would be to temper your expectations a bit and avoid shooting for the Moon
"ADHD meds are great when they work, but the initial effects you're experiencing won't remain this strong forever"
"After the first couple weeks, you'll settle in, and while the meds will still be tremendously helpful, that ""superhuman abilities"" thing is going to fade.

Keep in mind that human brains don't like sudden drastic changes; if you want changes that last, they have to be slow, gradual ones"
"So, enjoy your superhuman powers while they last, but for the longer term, don't plan to fix your entirely life in one fell swoop, pick smaller, more modest goals, starting with the most important issues in your life, and work on them one small goal at a time"
"Look for ""low hanging fruit"", areas where relatively small and painless interventions can give you a lot of practical improvement; devise ""damage control"" strategies for things that would take a lot of effort to fix properly.

And expect setbacks"
"It's two steps forward, one step back"
"You will relapse into old habits (""fall off the train"", as I call it), but the important part is that you don't allow that to turn into a negative spiral / slippery slope thing"
"Try to notice when it happens, dust yourself off, and get back on the next train."
Thanks for the advice
Luckily I’m getting hunger I think at the focal points of the extended release of the medication
It’s interesting to see how this journey will unravel.
It’s interesting now to see myself between the two sides of medicated vs unmedicated
It’s nice to have the choice of wanting to or not wanting to do something rather than feeling like I need to do everything and I can’t
It feels nice so far
Thanks I really appreciate the feedback
It seems like my euphoria based reaction of the initial doses is starting to taper which I’m happy about overall
Overall I’m still able to provide a lot more productivity and this ADHD tax has been minimized which is nice.

When I was 15 I got diagnosed with ADHD and given Adderall
"It seemed to work for a few months, but I think it was just the placebo effect because I wanted it to work so badly"
But it seemed like it was actually making me worse
"Where before I was scaping by through sheer anxiety, but for some reason when I was on the Adderall the anxiety decreased, and I was left with no motivator"
"I felt happy for the first time, and my emotional regulation symptoms decreased a lot, and the people around me kept telling me it seemed like it was working, because I cried less and was overall easier to deal with"
"But over time I lost the motivation to take the meds because even though I was on a high dose, I never noticed a difference"
"


There were a series of other tests and medications, which you can read if you want specifics; 
 I got put on Prozac too, and it gave me horrible heartburn, which my doctors said couldn't be from them, even though it always started seconds after I took the pills"
"I was also tested for a hormone disorder, and even though I had one, my doctor said it wasn't worth treating"
By 17 I had pretty much quit taking the meds
"Got on Lexapro at 18 from a new doctor, even though I came in for ADHD treatment because it was my biggest issue.

Tldr: eventually got a doctor that listened, stopped Adderall, started vyvanse and hormone meds, and it's now completely obvious to me that the Adderall never did a thing"
Being on VYVANSE makes me feel like I'm in control of myself for the first time I can ever remember
"Im not questioning my perceptions, and I don't do things I shouldn't without knowing why anymore"
"VYVANSE is a 14 hour medication, which is long for an ADHD med, but not a whole day"
"Even still, I feel better when it wears off because Im not exhausted from masking all day"
"Motivation is still hard, and I still don't have many good habits, but in general, it's drastically better than before"
"

I'm not saying VYVANSE is the answer for you, but what I am saying is the meds should be working better than what you're describing"
Different ADHD meds work on different pathways in the brain
"The meds are very different and there are a lot of options and combinations of multiple that can work, even within the categories of stimulants and non stimulants."
"thank you so much for this response, I definitely need a better doctor"
" Also when you had your hormone test was it for your endocrine system or more related to the chemicals in the brain that pertain to ADHD?  Thank you for sharing this, im glad you mentioned the timeline of the medication, I had not thought or been told about this ever"
"  A good doctor can really make a difference, I think thats the place to start."

for me personally I treat it like anticipation rather than fear
As long as you’re doing what you can to make your future better then you have no reason to worry because you’re doing your best
Shit happens sometimes
If you have big goals you’re striving for then these little bumps that we sometimes worry about become trivial
"Yeah I don’t like that some things happen, but I think “will I care 10 minutes or 10 days later”"
If you let it hold you up it’s affecting you much more than it should because you are letting it
"Don’t be afraid to fuck up and when you do just keep pushing forward, don’t let your setbacks define you, let your successes overshadow them"
"I know with adhd it’s hard to focus on more than the present, I struggle with it a lot, but a healthy amount of daydreaming and actually doing stuff to achieve the daydreams is what keeps me going"

I'm on Ritalin from next Monday. What should I expect?

Ritalin worked for me
"I would say that 20 minutes after taking it, suddenly it feels like you went through an Interstellar hyperspace jump and you’re suddenly in this state of mind where it’s easy to focus"
"There’s a slight pressure at the sides of your temples but it’s not uncomfortable, just feels like you’re being funnelled into focus, more like.

If there’s an overdose (I tried increasing doses to find the right dosage for myself), I feel heart palpitations"
"Even though the hyperspace feeling is there, it’s kind of drowned out by the fact my heart is going so fast"
"It’s a little uncomfortable.

Anyway, take note whether it works for you or not"
"Not all ADHD meds works for everyone because the causes of our ADHD might differ by brain chemistry.

Oh, also, try to take it with/after food"
The feeling is kind of raw if you don’t
And do you get kinda thirsty while on it so keep water nearby.
"In one sense, when the drug is working, everything gets easier in a way that’s hard to imagine"
" 
In another sense, it’s still up to you to make something of your new organizational skills!

Finally, when the drug mostly wears off, you are back to your normal..

Please drink water and eat A little regularly"
The stimulants tend to lower your appetie
 No one wants you crashing.
"In addition to what the others said, it's common for the first week or two to feel more noticeable / pleasurable than it does with long term use"
At least it did for me
The good feeling fades pretty quickly though and isn't the point of the meds
Generally the executive function boost lasts where the noticeable mood boost does not.
That’s what I’m on - Ritalin IR
It makes certain aspects of my work (executive functioning aspects) so much clearer and easier and has given me energy and a sense of being more on command of my time
Good luck!
How many times do you take it in a day? And in what dosages?
Mine’s the 10
I try to take it only once a day because I doubt I need to be in focus more for more than 4 hours a day
"I would if I had to do, like rushing something for a deadline."

I’m sorry you had that experience with your psych
 I’m sure she meant well
"

While I do agree with your Psych with regard to not depending on the meds"
But in this context I think she definitely misinterpreted you
"Personally, I go through something similar"
"When I take my meds roughly 4 to 5 hours after taking them, I’m ready to pass out"
"And when I mean pass out, I mean I’m sleeping for the next 6 hours"
So I take them periodically through the day
"On the way to work, so by the time I get there, get ready and start the day I’m ready"
" Then, around lunch I start to get sleepy again so I go to the gym"
" When I finish at the gym I’ll take a small dose to taper me for like two or three hours and then the last one and biggest dose I’ll take 6 hours before I plan on going to bed, which is usually around 2 or 3"
" 

For you, you may have to play with the dosing, does stronger dosing make the feeling stronger or last longer"
I know it’s different for everyone
 For me it’s roughly the same amount of time no matter the dosing but 20 mg and 50 mg feel the same to me
So I can spread 50 throughout the day without losing the feeling
"However, the crash at 50 is significantly higher than 20"
Granted everyone is different and you should definitely talk to your doc
"

Also it may help to remember that some of us have a hard time with criticism"
 Not saying you are soft but many of us don’t take criticism lightly
I don’t remember what it is specifically but I think it has something to do with executive functioning and processing negative feedback
My issue is I already have low self esteem so criticism is hard already but I’m pretty sure that’s the clinical why as some of us don’t take criticism well
But I’ve been working on it lol
And who knows maybe you might be in too
"So if you feel like you’re being in anyway unreasonable for feeling this way… you aren’t, for several reasons; just some food for thought."
I hate this idea that we only need to be medicated for work or school
My relationships are actually *more* important
"I’m only allowed 6 hours of healthy brain function and I’m supposed to give it all to my employer? Not to my partner, my kids, my own interests?? It’s some deep capitalist social conditioning behind that approach to healthcare."
You could always supplement with a non-stimulant (Strattera or Wellbutrin)
They have a much more long-lasting and persistent and background effect
"That's what's worked best for me, a non-stimulant plus a lower dose of Adderall."
I saw your response last night but let it sit until this morning where I read it again and I wish I could like it more than once
"I want to thank you for how you worded things so kindheartedly! You're right in that I don't always take criticism very well, but growing up with a parent who didn't hesitate in letting me know when I wasn't doing enough, I've tried my whole life to remember perspective is key when my emotions start to flare up! Doesn't always help as I end up just undercutting myself in favor of other people knowing more than me"
Like I'd rather be receptive in me being wrong or incorrect and learning than sticking up for myself which isn't always conducive to improvement
Gosh I hope that made sense
"

Thank you for explaining how you've gotten on with managing your med routine, I think that might actually be helpful as right now, I'm on Concerta 27mg once a day in the morning when I get to work and my psych has been pretty resistant to increasing or even changing it even in the slightest"
I believe she's worried about building a tolerance which I definitely get! Just feel maybe this dose is too low to be this limiting but she was very much gung-ho to increase my Wellbutrin and Sertraline despite me saying at multiple sessions how I was feeling pretty emotionally blunted and unmotivated but told me to stick it out in case I start to feel better when I never did and ended up stopping those 2 meds on my own before she listened to me on them
"

I really appreciate your thoughts on this and will bring them up with my psych next month"
"I did get my labwork back and looks like anemia might be playing some role here which i wouldn't be surprised but I've finally scheduled a PCP visit next week so I feel like i'm making some headway and I'm not just shooting in the dark but I'm glad you don't think i'm coming off unreasonable here, helps calm my nerves."
Unbelievably based
"You can say that again! I get 6ish hours of medication and then in order not to doze off or feel like executive dysfunction has me in a chokehold when I need to start tasks at home, I've been having a small cup of cold brew from our machine in my office before heading out for the night because it actually feels like it has an effect"
"I can lounge on my couch or play games with my partner without being out like a light in 30 minutes when it's just 7 or 8pm, ya know!"
That's a good idea! Wellbutrin seemed to only work in the short-term before feeling overbearing without any energy or positive headspace
Also made me twitchy after a few months on a high dose
"Took a long time of feeling like Adderall or Concerta and even Vyvanse just weren't working but once I stopped the Sertraline and Wellbutrin, i seemed to actually feel the effects of Concerta like the other two were muting it somehow"
So now I'm just on a stimulant because my adhd symptoms definitely exacerbate my depression so I want to try to tackle just this for right now like one thing at a time.
"Interesting, because Strattera was first \*trialed\* as an anti-depressant and the primary prescribing purpose for Wellbutrin is as an anti-depressant"
Goes to show that every person & their body's chemistry is unique.

I am not surprised you are feeling a wall has gone up
"Ideally, the wall is temporary"
"

I definitely encourage you to seek therapy help to take in the new turn of events in your life."
I understand that it can be frustrating
"It was a life changing event for you, you were not wrong or have to feel bad for being overwhelmed"
"Though, based on your post your husband was the one who recommend you the podcast, so I feel like he cared enough to share something that he thinks that might help you"
"And even with his comment, it didn't feel to me like he was being dismissive.
I know that it is very hurtful when it was a life changing information for you but for him it was not that big of a deal"
"But we can't expect that out spouses will react the way we imagined how they will react.

I'm glad that you're trying to get an official diagnosis"
It will definitely help out a lot
"Hope you all the best! 

Sorry for my bad English."
Get your diagnosis first
Relating to ADHD is common because the ADHD behavior is not something only ADHDers display
Everyone does but at a much lower level wherein with ADHD the behavior impairs your ability to go on with your day
This doesn’t mean you don’t have ADHD either; you can try a RELIABLE self-screening test like the one I will link below
"And as the expert in that video says, self-screening tools give you data on how do you compare to the general population in your likelihood to have ADHD"
"It is self-SCREENING, not self-DIAGNOSIS"
It’s like noticing a lump in your breast and going to the doctor to make sure you’re OK
You should let a healthcare professional do the diagnosis
"

It’s a typical response to “shut-down” for me when I feel misunderstood or unheard"
I usually take my time to understand why I shut-down and how can I get my point across when it happens
"In your case, I think what you can say is that you are undergoing diagnosis period and it has the power to change your view of life and yourself"
Only after diagnosis you can start asking understanding and openness about your ADHD or any other condition that mimic ADHD closely
"

Here’s the link"
 Don’t go into a rabbit hole
Knowledge is not power when you don’t have the general medicine training to put your observations into perspective

Everyone reacts differently to different stimulants
"I do great with Focalin, didn't do great with Concerta"
"You'll find stories in every which way, but the only way to know is to try it"
"For me, it was clear after one day that it was wrong, so on to something else."
I can’t really help with the Adderall situation but I take Concerta and find that it calms my anxiety
For a while my doctor had switched me to Foquest which I took for a year and found that my anxiety was back and that I was more aware of my anxiety
Since being back on Concerta for two months things have seemed to calm down.
"I hope your day went well.

I was on adderall 30 XR for 15 years and stoped for 2.5 and I started concerta 18 ER last week"
" My doctor today told me to double, or take it two tables a day"
 I am still making my mind on if I should go back to Adderall
I am hoping for the same results
I appreciate the response.
Yeah day 2 of concerta and I’m feeling full of anxiety
I think my body may be too old for stimulants
I’m glad concerta is working for you.
"I’ve been on adderall for 4+ years which I enjoy, but it doesn’t take away my anxiety, been meaning to try something different, but I’m afraid"
Let me know how it is!
I am going to leave my doctor a message on Monday to see if I can go back to Adderall
 I think age definitely plays a factor
 I'm 37 wishing I was still 17
Update: day 2 of concerta and I feel the same overwhelming anxiety as I did on adderall
I took it at 7AM
By about 10:30AM I was really bad
Rapid heart rate
Headache
I think stimulants are just no longer good for me
I’m 43
I will try a non stimulant route next
Keep everyone posted that is interested.
Will do
First day tomorrow
Fingers crossed.
"You going to keep continuing it? Or you just going to wait for new medication? Anyways keep me updated, I’d appreciate it!"
I am going to discontinue this
I take this as my body giving me signs
"Increased heart rate, headache and anxiety with no focus"
No pros here
I messaged my dr about something like Straterra
I will keep you posted.

"First of, Congratulations! I'm so happy for you! 

Had a similar feeling the first time I took Concerta.
The way you described it was on point"
"It took maybe 30mins to 1hr for it to kick in but the moment it did, my mind was suddenly quiet"
"Thought to myself ""This is how 'normal' people feel?"" I just enjoyed the moment and sat on the couch"
Might sound overly dramatic but I cried
"It was definitely an experience that I will never forget!

It was nice to read your experience"
Thank you for sharing.
"Some people will relate, but there are also some that need to try multiple doses or meds to find one that works for them"
Our bodies are all different and they react differently
Just here to remind this in case someone reading this post is wondering “Recently diagnosed but why are my drugs not working like the OP’s?”.
I (32M) was diagnosed a month ago and was prescribed Concerta
"On the second day, I went to a university lecture and was completely amazed because, for the first time, I was fully present and focused"
"For the first hour, I just smiled to myself because the feeling was so unexpected"
"For the first time, I was able to actively engage in the lecture and even participated in discussions—normally, I would just sit with my laptop and read the news"
This feeling is simply incredible.

The DSM5 states that in order for an adult to be diagnosed with ADHD they have to have shown symptoms before age 12
"So, that’s probably what they’re basing that off of."
"The diagnostic criteria include ""some symptoms must have been present before age 12"" - however, this is often misinterpreted as ""enough symptoms must have been present before age 12 to meet the diagnostic threshold"".

For example, if you have 8/9 inattentive symptoms now, then that would clear the diagnostic threshold for adults; if you had 4/9 inattentive symptoms before age 12, then that would not have been sufficient for a diagnosis at the time, but it would still qualify as ""some symptoms present before age 12"".

Unfortunately, there are no hard rules as to how many symptoms you must have had before age 12, or how severe they must be"
"Technically speaking, almost any random 8-year-old would probably qualify if you take it to extremes - kids that always keep their rooms tidy, never forget anything, never lose anything, always pay attention when you address them, etc., are basically a fairy tale, so the question is where you draw the line between normal, age-adequate behavior, and ""ADHD symptoms"""
"If you put the bar too low, then you'll get a lot of false positives, if you put it too high, you'll get a lot of false negatives"
"This is part of why some experts are arguing for abolishing the ""onset before age 12"" requirement.

But on the other hand, there's a pretty good reason to keep it, too - ADHD is believed to be a congenital condition, and its developmental, life-long character is an important feature to diagnostically distinguish it from things like PTSD or depression, which typically develop later in life.

Anyway, you may want to get a second opinion here"
"Especially with autism in the mix, ADHD can be tricky to diagnose, so I'd highly recommend finding someone who specializes in ADHD in adults - even an otherwise competent ""general"" psychologist may not be properly equipped to handle this."
"The reason is that ADHD is something you just have, not something you pick up later in life"
If you’re not sure get another diagnosis/second opinion
Other things can mimic the symptoms of ADHD
"When I was pursuing a diagnosis for one of my kids, their teacher was overlooking their struggles and we weren’t able to diagnose initially because it wasn’t present in two different situations, just reported at home"
"Their first move was to test for anxiety, because apparently the symptoms can overlap quite a bit."

"Late diagnosis here as well, when I started medication it killed a lot of my anxiety as well"
"I realized I used anxiety and fear to keep me in line, to motivate me and get things done, because otherwise I wouldn’t, In pretty much every area of my life"
"But the thing is when I started medication and everything all of a sudden felt possible, like folding my laundry was no longer equivalent to climbing a mountain, without the anxiety, I’ve lost my motivation"
"Sure I can focus better, but the drive from the constant fear, stress and anxiety is gone"
I’ve heard this is common though and it takes time to figure out other ways to motivate you! 
Meds are amazing when you have ADHD.
I really hope it’s like this for me
"I’m 44, was diagnosed with adhd a month ago, on escitalopram for anxiety and have an appointment to discuss medication next week."
Did you feel depressed at all? Trying to help my wife figure out if it’s the medication or the shock to her nervous system.
"Is the escitalopram not working for you? That's usually a med used for depression, not anxiety, I thought? Could be wrong though"
Do you think you might want to try a different one?
"ADHD seems like such a rollercoaster ride a temporary depression doesn't sound completely out of the realm of normalcy to me, just because of The, like you said, sudden change in her brain"
The settling down might be causing a feeling of lack of purpose
Hopefully it would be temporary! Just need to find new things to focus on.
"It kind of is, I am less anxious but I’m tired and struggling more getting work tasks done without the anxiety tbh"
I think it’s prescribed for both depression and generalised anxiety disorder
I’m not sure about switching as they all seem to have side effects at least initially
I’d probably prefer to not take it but I guess that’s easier to say now.
 I've heard that with any mental health condition it almost always requires tweaking to get the right medication and dosage
"You might need a lower dose or a different drug altogether, or quite likely it just takes some time for the brain to adjust too"
I wish you luck 🙏

"I have this same issue on and off.

My best solution so far is to look just below their eyes, at the cheekbone"
That way you aren't making weird eye contact and still looking at them.
"TLDR: 
Searching for anyone who has struggled with overthinking eye contact and social anxiety with ADHD and if anything what helped them work through it. "
"That’s me! I’ve posted about it before, but I focus so much on eye contact and what I’m doing with my hands that I’m not paying any attention to the conversation"
My full focus is on how I appear
"*Am I making enough eye contact? Am I making too much? How often should I blink? What should I do with my arms and hands? Damn, I’m awkward.*"
"Exactly, It feels like I’m fighting myself when those questions go through my head"
"(Ahh shit, focus, eyes, wait to much eyes, do something else, wait I was supposed to respond, what did they say, what’s an appropriate response, blurt the first thing you think, oh shit they looked away, they know I’m struggling, oh shit the conversation just completely derailed) It’s such a struggle for me because I never used to think about it at all and naturally I’m not usually an awkward person, lately I’d definitely describe myself as very awkward"

You could always buy a dozen tracker/locator products like Apple air tags or tile
"I’ve used tile in the past since they have a lot of different options and sizes (stuff for your keys, credit card sized trackers for your wallet, etc)"
It’s an investment to say the least but if all of your important stuff has a tracker attached to it then finding it becomes a lot easier
So for my cards I got a wallet phone case
"Keys and stuff are another story( I freaking love winter time because more pockets!) sorry I’m
Not more help, but also setting up a specific area on a shelf has helped me (when I remember to put stuff back in its place)."
I have a large wallet that I keep my cards and cash in and I can fit my car key fob thing in
"
I’m also a female so was used to having a purse from a young age but that was a whole ordeal and I’d lose things in the purse bc it was a black hole"
"

So I have a wallet and any time I go out I’ll carry it in my back pocket or under my arm with either my phone on it under my arm or my phone in my back pocket"
"

Any time I move from a place or get in to a car or building I’ll do a pay down to double check I have both"
It’s become instinctive and I’m now used to the weight of both that if I don’t have them I notice pretty quickly that they aren’t on my person
"

The only time I will put them in a bag is when I’m cleaning out my car and headed  inside"
I put everything in the bag and hangs the bag in the hall then if I need anything out of it I’ll take it out and add it back in
"
But when getting into the car I don’t have the wallet and phone in the bag(it’s specifically the car bag bc it only goes and stays in the car) they are in hand so my brain and body is geared up and ready to be on guard for them"
"

And typically my phone is stacked on top of my wallet under my arm or my phone is in my back pocket and wallet under arm in that case."
I didn’t get diagnosed with ADHD until very recently in my 40’s
I used to have a long running inside joke with my friend of over 20 years about me misplacing my debit card
Every time we went somewhere I inevitably put my debit card in a new pocket or spot that I’d forget about in 2 seconds
I finally got one of those phone cases with a few slot holders on the back to house my debit card and ID
GAME CHANGER
For my keys I put a little carabiner on them and hook it to my clothing somehow
"It looks lame, but it hasn’t backfired on me in 10 years."

"No, lol"
"Sometimes I swear this sub should just be called “I’m bad at something, it must be ADHD”"
I have a good sense of direction
I can drive to and from places in my city without guided direction
It may have to do with learning how to use a map and compass at a young age that made wired me well for directions
The only time ive lost sense of direction is when ive gotten light headed or just waking up.
"I've never had someone related to this before, but YES"
"I don't know my left or rights, I don't know where anything is even though I've been there a million times before"
I still need directions to my best friend (of 10 years) who only lives a couple of blocks away house
"I have lived in the same home my entire life, but I still struggle ALOT with directions"
"When I get public transport, I get severe anxiety cause I don't know where I am even though I have actually been there before"
"May be something completely different, but I struggle with this as well."
"I personally don't, but I can easily see how someone could."
Yes I’m like this too
"I’m sure it’s related to adhd or commonly comorbid as is dyslexia or dyspraxia, but not everyone with adhd has it"
"
I’ve gone the wrong way at least twice today, well this evening, probably half a dozen times this morning."
[deleted]
"No I mean I know it's not ADHD thing, but I still made sure, cause I have impostor syndrome about having Dyspraxia"
When I'm walking somewhere relatively new - then walking the exact same way back i can't remember which way to go even though I recognise the area
And if I go somewhere in a different direction (eg entering the street from the left instead of the right like I'm used to) i automatically get lost
"I had a ""test"" for learning disorders because I also can't do maths for the life of me or read a clock, they said I didn't have it mainly because I am really good at english and I know what shapes are 🤷‍♀️"
"It took me years to get diagnosed with ADHD because I had good behaviour, was smart and I am a girl"
So maybe I do have it lol
It absolutely is not.
I don’t know what dyspraxia is
What is that?
Effects fine and Gross motor skills
In other words it makes you clumsy af
"

On physical side: Bad balance, throwing, catching, running, bumping into things, dropping items, bad manipulation skills with hands, bad handwriting and drawing skills, imitating movements like work outs in gym and doing everything wrong in such things, etc.

Mental side: Slow processing speed, bad memory, bad at understanding instructions, bad sense of direction, multitask, getting tired easily, etc."

"I'm terrible about this, unless I'm on vacation"
🤷 I'm curious about other people's tips as well!
"I've personally been using this app called ""Habitica"""
A friend who is diagnosed recommended it to me weeks ago and it's pretty fun as it treats things like chores or habits as a game
"So just as I also have the problem of maintaining a routine of brushing my teeth (and other stuff), I use the app and treat it as a ""to do"" list to try and build up habits"
I don't want to get too deep into how the app works  (because its a lot) but I'd recommend using it to see if it works for you and possibly looking into videos on how the app works
"If you do your habits (like brushing teeth), you gain health and experience and go up a level"
"If you miss out on a habit, the app holds you accountable and you lose health"
"To keep your avatar alive and get rewards, you need to do your dailies/habits.

It would also be helpful to use it with a friend so as to hold yourself accountable when getting your daily tasks/habits done"
"Me and my friend use it and check on each other to ensure we're doing our dailies (like cleaning, bathing, etc)"
There's in chat features where you can talk with friends and engage to complete tasks
"I'm still NEW to using the app but so far, its been a little helpful in building a routine"
I still miss out on a few dailies but I TRY to be consistent
The app isn't perfect but it still helps a bit
"It would be worth a try for you if you want to build a routine in the future.

Aside from the habitica app.."
I try to at least aim to brushing my teeth once a day and I hope I can build up back to two times daily
"If I don't feel up to it, I would settle with using mouthwash and then the next day, I ensure I brush my teeth"
I think another alternative to not using toothpaste is possibly a baking soda solution? So maybe if you don't want to brush your teeth with toothpaste (on some days perhaps
Still at least try to incorporate using toothpaste) you can try baking soda and maybe dry brushing? I haven't tried baking soda but you can look into it and see if it helps.
I brush and floss right before I shower
I turn the water on and while it's warming up I brush and floss and try not to take too long so I don't waste too much water then the when I am done the shower water is warm and I shower.
"I got cleaning done recently and my dentist showed the pictures of stains on my teeth it sucked 
and I took pictures of that on my phone and now have made a decision to 
1.buy the best toothbrush their possible 2.get regular cleaning and 
3"
Every time I feel tired or lazy to brush I am going to see those pictures
I've noticed that when I'm on vacation I'm great at remembering but usually I'm not.
"Thanks for so many tips, I'll definitely try out the app, and see if any of my friends can join me"
Maybe I can look into more different toothpaste flavors because I remember as a kid I loved this one flavor of toothpaste so I'll look into something that tastes better
Mouthwash is a big issue for me but I'll definitely try a bunch of your tips! thanks!
"I should do that, or at least floss before I shower, great idea"
"That makes sense, and no time is wasted!"
No problem! And definitely look into different toothpaste flavors
That may help ease you into using toothpaste consistently again
"Even if you need to stick with a flavor made for kids, its better than nothing"
I wish you all the luck!!

I do not recommend drinking while taking your meds

Horrible hangover too
Since you’ll be on vacation you will probably be okay not taking your meds if you’re planning on drinking

The short answer is yes
"

A lot of confusion comes from the fact that traumatic life can damage the same areas in the brain that ADHD already affects.

To check whether you have neurological damage to the frontal lobe from traumatic experiences or have innate ADHD, you have to remember whether you displayed the ""positives"" of ADHD in early life"
"Like fast thinking, creative and connecting way of seeing the world, etc."
"ADHD generally genetic, though it can also be caused by traumatic brain injury"
"But ADHD isn't the only cause of executive function issues, or really any of the symptoms associated with ADHD"
"If you didn't have it as a child, it may be a different diagnosis"
"

But only a doc can tell you for sure."
I don’t know if “born with” is correct (research is ongoing as to the interplay between genetics and environment and perhaps even early childhood brain injuries) but it does have to be something that caused issues in childhood
"A lot of people, like myself, have the experience of being diagnosed late and having that diagnosis explain things about our childhood and adolescence that we didn’t understand"
"Those of us who had constant and strict parental control, or who were just good at performing under pressure on tests (both of those for me) may have had the consequences of our symptoms suppressed until we started being responsible for our own lives as teenagers and adults and the wheels start coming off"
"

And it wasn’t like I didn’t have problems as a kid, they just didn’t matter to adults because my grades were fine"
I don’t think I ever had a school project that didn’t involve angry parents and tears the night before it was due
I developed a neurotic and unpleasant personality in response to the anxiety of not knowing why I couldn’t manage tasks and time
"My report cards would say “needs to work on staying on task” but I ended up with A’s and B’s anyway, and that’s all that mattered to the adults in charge of my learning and health, anything else was just bad behavior that had to be disciplined out of me."
Supposedly genetic & gets worse based on environment
By definition ADHD must be present in early childhood
That’s part of the diagnostic criteria
"So if it wasn’t present in early childhood, it’s not ADHD.

However, symptoms that look like ADHD can be caused by trauma (psychological or physical) or brain injury among other conditions and disorders with later onset"
"The important thing is that while ADHD is an executive function disorder, not every executive function disorder is ADHD"
"

I want to note here that just because symptoms weren’t observed or noted in early childhood, that doesn’t necessarily mean they weren’t present"
"But if it seems pretty clear that you had no symptoms until adolescence or until adulthood, your doctors should be exploring other possible explanations for your symptoms."
yup and if you got it you can bet some of your siblings have it too
I have it and so does my Sister and my big brother
"I'm not an expert but what I understand is that no one knows for certain, but that if you have ADHD now you probably always had it, even if your symptoms weren't apparent then, also keep in mind that distractibility (and other ADHD symptoms) are seen as normal for young children and wouldn't really present as unusual or problematic until you start higher level education where you're responsible for your own revision and completing homework etc"
Most of the time yes
However there is a possibility that a severe TBI can cause ADHD
Yes it’s something a person is born with
"

There are many disorders that have similar symptoms as adhd/many reasons a person may experience some symptoms of adhd while not having adhd"
"From 0-7 years old you're basically just one big nervous system in development,  ADHD is just a certain way a nervous system can be programmed"
"Similar to baking a cookie, the environment you bake your cookie in will affect its shape, but the ingredients of the cookie dough affects its likelihood to develop into a certain shape"
"In that same way, ADHD can be triggered by environmental conditions e.g"
"trauma, but for a different cookie with different ingredients/genetics it may turn out completely different under the same conditions.

So like your born with how predisposed you are to your brain turning how to be ADHD shaped/wired due to genetics - but no one leaves the womb with a fully ADHD coded brain (as far as my understanding goes)"
"

....I hope that made sense....50/50, my explanation skills aren't the best 😂"
I’m suprised you even got a diagnosis with no childhood symptoms; my boyfriend scored 8/9 and 7/9 for adult criteria but could not be diagnosed because his scores in childhood were below the threshold
His diagnosis was given by a very reputable psychiatrist with the approval of a psychologist (in case people question the validity)
"

ADHD is almost unanimously agreed to be a neurodevelopmental condition"
"If you had no symptoms from childhood then later in life symptoms started and then started getting worse, they were almost definitely caused by something else"
There are plenty of things than can manifest in a similar way to ADHD but they seem to have more shame attached to them
There’s no shame to having ADHD symptoms without ADHD!
Born with it
It’s genetic
"According to the best known knowledge on the subject, ADHD is something people are born with"
"If a person did not notice it growing up, probably there were environmental factors that contributed to not being aware of it"
This is why many of the first signs at ADHD exist happen when a person is in school when there can be comparisons of different children’s learning and behavioral styles.
Yes
Yes it is.
Generally in most cases yes
What ages are we talking about though? I don’t remember just getting symptoms out of nowhere but when I was younger I had less responsibilities and less expectations so I didn’t struggle a lot with it except for in school which actually got easier for me with the years.
Some psychiatrists argue it’s not
There’s a reason for the term “adult adhd”
ADHD is something you’re born with as it’s generally genetic
"However, it can take time for symptoms to appear"
In some cases it can be missed completely until later in life
This can happen from symptoms being less severe or from not having an assessment or from a misdiagnosis for something else
It can also occur if you have multiple conditions that can share symptoms with ADHD
Keep in mind ADHD symptoms on their own don’t necessarily meet the DSM5 criteria for ADHD
Executive dysfunction for example can be caused by other conditions
If you don’t recall having symptoms as a child it’s possible you could be misdiagnosed and it could be something else
A dr would know more.
"ADHD can develop 3 ways; it is inherited genetically, caused by genetic mutation, or caused by brain damage/trauma"
"

ADHD is also the only attention based disorder recognized in the dsm5, therefore there is a wide variety of symptoms, as there are subtypes that haven't been studied enough to be definitively named."
Kinda
It’s genetic
" But based on the DSM5, symptoms don’t have to appear until I think age 12 for a diagnosis."
"Yeah, I’m kind of wondering the same thing to"
My early life was fine but in my teen years I noticed something was off and got diagnosed with pretty severe adhd
It feels like the symptoms got worse and worse from age 13-14 but it has kind of stayed level now
"Just to clear this up here: ""trauma"" can refer to *physical* trauma (i.e., brain damage due to injury, a stroke, or (neuro)toxins), or to *psychological* trauma (""traumatic experiences"").

Psychological trauma does not cause neurological damage to the frontal lobe, at least not to an extent that would cause ADHD"
"More commonly, it may lead to psychological disorders such as PTSD, anxiety, depression, etc., which have significant symptom overlap with ADHD, but they are different disorders with different treatment paths, and differential diagnosis is possible and important.

Physical trauma can cause symptoms that meet the diagnostic criteria for ADHD (except childhood onset), and stimulant ADHD medications are often an effective treatment, but there's still a bit of a debate about whether this should be classified as actual ADHD, or as a separate condition.

> To check whether you have neurological damage to the frontal lobe from traumatic experiences or have innate ADHD, you have to remember whether you displayed the ""positives"" of ADHD in early life"
"Like fast thinking, creative and connecting way of seeing the world, etc.

No, that's not how that works"
"Those aren't ""positives of ADHD"", and many people with ADHD have none of these"
"People who are intelligent and have ADHD will often end up thinking fast (for better or worse), because that's one skill they can tap into to compensate for their ADHD, but that doesn't mean they can think faster or better because they have ADHD - they think faster because they can, and because ADHD incentivizes it"
"Likewise, someone who is naturally creative and has ADHD will use their creativity to help navigate life, and of course creativity, like many skills, responds to frequent practice, so in some people, a virtuous circle occurs - creative solutions help with the ADHD, so you get creative more often, so your creativity improves, and you use creativity to deal with ADHD more often"
"But you're not more creative because of ADHD, just like when poverty forces you to walk or run to school every day instead of taking the bus or having your parents drive you, that doesn't mean being poor makes you a better runner"
And it definitely doesn't mean that whether you're a good runner says anything about whether you are legit poor or not.
Environment meaning exposure to neurotoxins.
Both of my brothers have hyperactive and I have inattentive
My kid has combined
> ADHD can be triggered by environmental conditions e.g
"trauma

This can be a bit misleading - the ""trauma"" that this refers to is physical trauma, i.e., brain damage; ADHD is not caused by psychological trauma, which is what most people would think when you phrase it like this.

The most commonly accepted hypothesis right now is that ADHD has physiological root causes, that is, whether you get it or not is largely down to genetics, physiology, and, possibly, exposure to certain toxins before or shortly after birth"
"It is *not* caused by social environments, upbringing, stress, smartphones, etc"
"However, those factors do shape the particular form ADHD will take as the brain develops, which is why different people with ADHD will have seemingly radically different symptoms - that's the ""developmental"" part"
"But it does not mean that you ""develop"" ADHD, it means that because you have ADHD, you ""develop"" ADHD symptoms as you grow up.

Late-onset ADHD due to brain damage is still somewhat up for debate - brain trauma can cause symptoms that will meet the current diagnostic criteria for ADHD (except childhood onset), and for many people who experience this, ADHD medication will help, so from a practical point of view, it makes sense to group this under the ""ADHD"" diagnosis"
"However, it seems likely that the underlying physiological causes are different, and that different treatment options may appear in the future, so some experts would rather see this defined as a separate disorder."
One of the DSM 5 criteria is that symptoms were there before the age of 12! I guess it’s easy to misread though
It's also often misread in the other direction
"It doesn't say ""*the* symptoms"", nor does it say ""*all of* the symptoms"", or ""enough symptoms to clear the diagnostic threshold"" - just that *some* symptoms of ADHD must have been present before age 12.

It's technically fine to have only two mild ADHD symptoms before age 12, but then have 8 *different* symptoms by age 20 - that's still enough to formally meet the diagnostic criteria, yet a lot of diagnosers will refuse to diagnose you if you don't meet the childhood diagnostic threshold in hindsight.

Not to mention that the entire ""onset before age 12"" requirement is currently being debated, because it may lead to excessive false negatives - people who try to get diagnosed in their 40s, 50s and 60s, will often have trouble producing a reliable account of their childhood experiences, and other evidence (school reports, witness statements, etc.) is often absent or equally unreliable."

"Ymmv, I find that adderal gives me the focus to implement my ideas"
"Before, I could never get out of the planing stage."
"Nope, no negative effects on my creativity"
Just the ability to more readily and reliably execute my creative ideas
"Namely, music making.

Edit: I take 50mg a day of Adderall"
I’m also on medication for bipolar depression and that doesn’t stop me either
Guess I’m lucky?
"Yes, I’ve experienced this too.

Adderall can make you laser focused to the point that creativity itself is a distraction"
"Practical people suffer from being too narrow minded in their pursuits, which ultimately leads to them knowing less about the world.

What I’ve found personally works is… [redacted] well you’d have to ask me for that"
It restores the creativity without making you unfocused
"

(Technically caffeine helps me in this regard too, but 2 stimulants is a bad idea, and caffeine interferes with adderall)"
This has been a struggle for me as well
"I feel less social & playful/fun, which I think impacts my creativity"
I feel more zoned in but also easily irritated if anybody interferes while I'm in the middle of a task
"I brought this up to my psych, and she said, that's just how stimulants affect some people"
I really want to try other meds to see if they impact me any differently though.
">I've noticed mainly that I don't think of words to use that aren't basic when I write

I receive the opposite effect from my Adderall"
When I'm writing while on medication I notice I'm able to pull out words that I didn't even remember existed within the depths of my lexicon
"Tbf, this could just be my undiagnosed autism (possibly hyperlexic) presenting face a bit more when my ADHD is being medicated.

As for your other experiences with the effects of Adderall, I do experience fewer tangential thoughts, which in turn allows me to stay focused on the topic that is actually under discussion/debate"
"The positive outcome of this being that I don't feel the strong need to speak those random thoughts out of turn, so I am no longer repeatedly interrupting others while they're in the middle of saying something"
"Generally, unless you're conversing with someone else who also has ADHD, these effects of medication are positive ones (or as you worded it, being ""normal"")"
"If you are bothered by forgetting points you feel are of importance when debating/conversing, you could try using a field notebook/notepad to jot these thoughts down when they occur."
I definitely feel that! I have ADHD and when I take adderall it’s a lot easier to lock in on tasks but it’s harder to formulate thoughts or express myself articulately and it makes it a lot harder for me to eat!
Yes
It’s the worst.
Me and one friend of mine indeed had similar experience
"ADHD brains are more prone to associative thinking, which may make you lose focus (who hasn't laughed at a random joke you remember hearing a decade ago?), but it does lend itself to many an A-HA creative moments"
"Adderall, as all medication, may be very helpful, but it's down to your individual needs what dosage etc"
suits you best
"I do not recommend experimenting without doctor's approval, obviously.

It's just that mileage may vary"
"Some people stay on stimulants for life, some use them EOD depending on their needs and schedule, some decide they feel better without them altogether."
I have pretty much the opposite experience.
Same here.
Try Ritalin it was better for me than adderall
I swear I see this post already
Yessss I noticed that too
"Took adderall for about 10 years, I’ve been off of it a year and still can’t write creatively anymore 😞"
I had the same problem on Elvanse/  lisdexamfetamine
I thought I was becoming less talented at first 😂 but then realised it’s the meds
"

So I stopped taking it in on days I need to be creative and make sure I’ve done all the admin and boring stuff ahead of time."
That's what the medicine is supposed to do
Many pre med behaviors and interests are coping mechanisms
"Meds change the rules of the ADHD game, and after starting meds, we play a new game called, ""Is this a symptom or actually me?"" Meds are not a cure"
They are the equivalent of wearing glasses to see at 20 20
"The trade-off is you can see clearly, but now realize that your whole life is viewed through a window, and no one with ADHD wants to stay inside all day.."
"that is, well, boring"
"It can feel unsettling at first, but after some time, it will even out."
This is a good point
"You might be more creative and ""free"" but how often did you actual make use of any of those ideas?"
"Yes, same here"
I can write so much more easily—both music and academic work (I'm a musician by hobby and literary scholar by trade)
It's so funny how these medications affect us all so differently.
"Same, but Vyvanse, and writing"
I can best describe it as a sort of declogging the drain
"My thoughts flow more smoothly, I can better keep on a train of thought, and I find the words I’m looking for more quickly and without getting distracted when they don’t come."
Is [redacted] legal in 26 states an D.C.?
"Whaaaaaaaat you can’t do that, what’s redacted? "
"I have a feeling that [redacted] is one of the reasons I don't experience bad side effects like loss of appetite, or loss of creativity/becoming rigid in my thinking"
"I actually enjoy the redacted more because I can focus that creativity, ultimately leading to a better creative process."
"Intriguing, do you mind telling us more? :)"
"Tried Focalin, didn't do anything"
😔
Yes but that’s not an acceptable outcome
There has to be ways to remain creative and still be able to execute
"Yeah, exactly"
I write lyrics too not just music so I completely agree.
"It’s actually legal in all states, this sub just forbids me from talking about it"
👺
![gif](giphy|uitkKV1p5qBer8ncY4)
"It’s the sub’s rules, not me"
Ask me somewhere else.
LMAO we’re talking about very different [redacted] ‘s 😭😭😭
"My guy, talking about the benefits and not telling us the name, no way"
I want my side effects to go
Please PM me.
That could work too
"I gotta tell yall tho to not smoke anything, eat it or maybe vape, but smoking anything causes cancer."
i am very curious about that now haha
Please PM me this legal creative juice 🥤 🥸
lol no actually
What is it? How did you know he was talking about another thing? Please PM me!

"That’s super fucked up, she shouldn’t be talking to *any* patient that way"
“Her dog could pass the school I’m in”??? Is so disrespectful
"Would your parents listen if you told them you didn’t want to see her anymore? That the way she speaks to and about you doesn’t make you feel encouraged and hurts your self esteem? I’m so mad on your behalf cause wtf?? 😭

Even though I believe that people should try their best at high school at the least since it’s an unfortunate truth that it’s much more difficult to go through life without a diploma or a GED, some people just don’t do well with the way schools are structured and that doesn’t make you stupid."
Get a new doctor.
I’m so sorry you’re dealing with this
There are going to be some people  with very strong opinions that are very weak intelligently (even in professional positions with accreditation!)
School is not for everyone and the fact that you are already paving your own entrepreneurial path means you’re already well ahead of your peers
"Most people (myself included) blindly follow the school path and become adults with no personality because we don’t know what we enjoy doing, much less how to capitalize on it"
"This is not an ideal situation despite it being marketed as such.

Please keep your confidence because you’ve earned it"
Unfortunately you can’t stop some of the forces against you right now because you are a minor
This is something I’ve dealt with as well
"Just be patient and respectful and grab every ounce of freedom that you can, because it sounds like you know how to put it to use.

I feel for you and hope this doesn’t bring you down too much"
"Also remember that the more positive you can keep yourself while going through this, the easier it is to make a point that your parents/doctor/any authoritative body are misunderstanding the situation"
"It’s hard to fake being okay with a shitty situation, but it’s how a lot of us have to survive"
At least until we can take full control of our own situation.
"Wtf????? She's a bad psychiatrist dude

If she had any idea about ADHD she'd know that ADHD is not something you can overcome with just pure will, 4 hours a day of studying won't do a shit"
"It took me 8 hours to listen to the whole 30 minute video for Uni and stuff, so I'm speaking from experience"
"And then school is by far not the most important thing in our lives, especially if a person has a strong talents outside of school"
fuck her for that too.
"I'd ask your parents to see a different psychiatrist, make it clear you no longer trust her because she advised them to take away the only things you're passionate about and it's making you miserable"
I'd also report her yourself to the regulatory board for patient abuse
This is wildly inappropriate regardless of how old you are
"Taking away a child's outlets is the worst thing you can possibly do to them, especially if they're healthy outlets"
Ok
You can graduate with C's
"If you graduate with C's and run your own business you have a skill set for any future job you decided to get. 


You can also ask your parents to research comorbidity with ADHD"
"Unless your business is selling marijuana or other drugs (which if your business is selling marijuana or other drugs I'm going it agree it should be taken away from a 15 year old), you have taken your interests in a healthy direction instead of increasing anxiety, depression or substance use you have found an outlet that allows you to participate in the world, while still maintaining the basic requirements you need to get to graduation. 


Also please refer them to research that says most people with ADHD respond poorly to consequences, and well to a challenge"
"You are currently meeting the challenge of managing school basics with a job, if your parents were smart they would give you the challenge of being able to make and keep a portfolio of job skills you have learned while running your business for when you want to apply to college or a position working for someone else (Be that at 18, or 25 or 30), or create projections of the sustainability of your business as a career path, and if it is not sustainable how you could diversify income streams to make enough money to live off of"
"(Like if you mow lawns, could you do plowing and snow removal) 


Good on you for putting all your energy and interest to good use, just make sure you continue to keep ties towards other potential futures. "
Look up your local way to report a psychiatrist
 That is unacceptable behavior to speak to a client like that
I would report her to the board
None of her damn business about what you decide to do in life.
Woah
This is extremely unprofessional
"You should see a new doctor immediately, and have a lengthy conversation with your parents as well"
"

Right now your parents are just following orders of someone they believe knows more than them, but your doctor is hardly a professional"
"OP, if I were you, here's what I would do: 

1"
Show them this post and any of the comments about the unprofessionalism and inappropriate behavior of your doctor and ask them if you can see a different psychiatrist with your best interests in mind
"

2"
Find a new psychiatrist and use reviews to help you filter out the good ones vs bad ones
Talk to your psychiatrists about options that could help you perform better in school and stay organized
"

3"
"If your bike and business are still confiscated, create some sort of reward system with your parents to incentivize good work"
"For example, for every B you get, you get one hour of your choice; for every A you get, 5 hours, etc 

Best of luck! 15 is a hard age"
"But school is the most important, so don't throw this time away"
Good grades will take you far in life
Keep working hard so that you have the freedom to keep pursuing what you're good at and what you are passionate about.
Ask your parents for a second opinion and come through with some research and backup to support yourself
This is WILD and I don’t think another psych would share their opinion.
That psychiatrist sucks and your parents are listening to them
I'm assuming you've spoken to your parents about how this psychiatrist isn't really trying to understand you and you want to see someone else? If so then your parents suck too and if you don't like your life being in their hands it might be time to start taking it in your own
Do what they would need to do if they had taken your side: call your family doctors office (or whoever referred you to that psychiatrist) and explain to them you'd like to be referred to someone else because this psychiatrist doesn't listen or try to understand you
If they ask to speak to your parents instead tell them the reason you called is because you don't trust your parents to be able to speak for you because they don't listen to you either
"Not that I think you'd lie about anything, but you should be very careful to tell the exact truth of what happened so there is less chance of them brushing you off as ""just some kid"" or something"
"There is already enough there to be cause for concern in your case, so the truth is on your side anyways.

If that doesn't get you anywhere do you have a guidance counselor at school? A trusted teacher or two? Coach? Librarian? Start talking to them"
"Don't just ask for advice, ask them if they can help you because no one is listening to you.

Be ready for your parents to be upset with you"
They will be upset because they will be ashamed that other people know that they failed you
It's their fault so feel free to let them wallow in it.
"Try your best to get a new psychiatrist, she has no idea what she is talking about"
"School's main job is to prepare you for your career, but you've already started it"
Lots of successful people actually drop out of school to pursue their business (though I'm not suggesting doing that)
" If building a resume is the #1 priority, real world experience is a must have"
"Also, exercise is necessary for being healthy.

Find a new psychiatrist, try your best in school"
Find ways to be as efficient as you can be with school work
Unfortunately ADHD/ADD is misunderstood by a lot of people.
"Talk to the more supportive, involved, and helpful parent heart to heart"
Don’t do both at the same time
"Trust me, I’m a 57 year school teacher and parent of 3 adults"
Plead your case to one at a time
And do so thoughtfully and under control
Since you want to be treated as an adult conduct yourself as one
Best of luck to you!!
Sounds like a shit doctor
"Yeah this is wrong on her part, I’m so sorry"
"She sounds like quite a condescending woman, and totally unqualified to be treating ADHD"
"Tell your parents you want to find a new doctor because the one you have is rude, and completely ignorant of your medical condition or how to help you"
"Tell your parents you’d like to do well in school, but you can’t with untreated ADHD, and this psychiatrist has proven that she is not able or willing to treat your medical condition."
Definitely ask your parents for a new doctor
That was really fucked up for her to say and suggest
"Are your parents really agreeing with her and taking away ur business?? I’m not sure how easily convinced or lenient your parents are but you should talk to them about how your business helps you + talk to them about how you’re really struggling with school bc of your condition and how taking away something u care about isn’t going to solve it.

school is very important but it’s not like you want to do poorly in school based on your post and you’re clearly trying to seek help which she is not providing"
thanks for everyone's support it means a lot
"I can believe it’s true, but it’s unbelievable to which extent this is f_ed up!! 
I really hope your parents have the discernment to counter this “recommendation”"
"
Keep us updated really !"
get a diff doctor
The mother and me agrees about school being important right now because the business will still be there in three years when you’ve graduated high school
"You can take a GED test, but not having a high school diploma will follow you in a negative way"
Like it or not you gotta ask yourself
What is the job of a teenager
"If you want to run your own life, make all your own decisions and just focus on work then you need to get your GED and move out where you can do that.

Also, something I regularly drill into my teenager is you can’t do anything about how your psychiatrist chooses to act or treat you"
You can focus on how you react to it
You’ll run into shitty people your whole life and you can’t just sit there and whine about what they have done
"Focus on the things you can do like getting your GED and taking charge of your life, especially if you don’t like how other people are commenting on it."
"Call a lawyer, and see if you can get emancipation"
"Also, see what your options are regarding the doctor and see if you can sue her for interfering with your LITERAL BUSINESS, if you have any employees even better, since now you have more possible damages"
"Especially, if your parents followed this idiot’s advice, I think you may have a case."
Switch doctors
That's the best advice I can give
I've been there and it's pretty discouraging to have someone who doesn't understand you as your doctor/therapist
"In which case, changing is the best option.

Otherwise, I don't think that they should force you to do school if you don't enjoy it"
"When you have ADHD, the only option is to do that which you love otherwise you'll pretty much suffer all through"
"Whenever I've tried forcing myself to do stuff that really doesn't suit me, I get depressed"
"Otherwise, that's pretty much all I can say."
I'm shocked so many people are jumping in to tell a 15 year old not to listen to their literal DOCTOR AND PARENTS based on hearing one side of the story
"

I'm sorry you're going through this OP"
"You should talk to your parents and psychiatrist about it, not random people on Reddit."
Yes 15 year old just get a new doctor
This
Get a new doctor ASAP
What is really infuriating is that at your age meds will help your prefrontal cortex develop more normally
"Not a cure, but you will be a higher functioning adult with them now than without them now."
"my parents locked down everything I have linking me to my buisness connections on my phone, shopify, whatsapp, everything"
"I litteraly have customers that need info about there items, tracking numbers, and all that stuff that I can no longer access"
You can definitely do something about how the psychiatrist acts and treats patient
"You can report them.

You're raising your teenager to be a pushover"
"Just taking shit from people because they think they can't do anything about it, they just have to be strong enough to deal with it."
"if you have a bad psychiatrist for your own disabled child you just let it be because ""they need to learn they will run into shitty people""? that's a medical issue, not a time to make a life lesson"
disappointing 
"Absolutely, you can do something about a psychiatrist who is acting or treating you inappropriately"
"

One is to see another psychiatrist, and the other is to report them to their regulatory body.

You have basically repeated what the psychiatrist has already told the OP, which is some of the most ridiculous advice that can ever be given to anyone who has ADHD"
"

How can you expect to tell a person with executive function issues to just do what you say as a solution? 

It's completely nonsensical."
"Also, if the bike was a corporate asset, then technically your parents confiscated something that didn’t even belong to you…"
"Maybe you can work out a compromise where you wind down your business / settle all existing deals before focusing on school for a few months?

It might help to remind your parents there are real people on the line paying for your products, and possible legal or fraud implications if you fail to deliver (hoping you set up an LLC)"
"I sympathize though, for us to lose the things we’re actually passionate about is tough"
"The situation described didn’t involve any violation of their license or patient rights, so based on what was described, there’s nothing to report"
Teaching someone to focus on self improvement first before whining that somebody else is a meanie is healthy
"I never said don’t turn people in, you invented that"
I’m down with a healthy process for dealing with conflict and whining doesn’t fit in that model anywhere.
"Yes, it’s disappointing when people make things up"
My own disabled teen gets coached to address problems themselves and advocate for self
I’m not always going to be around to help my teen
"Someday I will die, likely before they do"
The teen is introduced to resources to make sure needs are met
OP is going to have to find a way to get help because it sounds like they aren’t able to effectively communicate with the doctor or their parents.
"Cambridge English Dictionary

If you say someone should put up or shut up, you mean that they should either take action in order to do what they have been talking about, or stop talking about it: You keep saying you’re going to ask her out"
"Well, put up or shut up.

I have an autistic/adhd teen"
I have my own set of alphabet that includes adhd
"If a person can’t do it alone, they better learn how to get help"
There’s a community organization that teaches people with developmental and learning disabilities how to function as independently as possible
I’m sure there’s one near enough to everyone if you look.

The level of restriction on these meds in the US is insane to me
Requiring monthly in person visits would be a huge strain on our healthcare system (Canada)
I have telehealth appointments with my prescriber on average every three months.
"My pharmacist asked ""was this a telehealth visit, or in person?""


Well, I physically went to her office"
"*I* was personally there, even if she was on a TV.


""In person."""
This is probably due to a DEA mandate requiring in person visits for the prescription of controlled substances that will be coming back into effect at some point after being flexible through the pandemic
"It was set to come back into effect at the end of this year, so the pharmacy wouldn't have a choice, but just a few days ago it was announced that it was extended until the end of 2025"
So maybe check again with your pharmacy and see if their policy will be changed based on that announcement
"Or look for another pharmacy.   


And you should raise this with your psychiatrist to see if she can see you in person when it is needed"
"When the mandate does go back into effect, you may only need to be seen once in person or maybe a couple of times a year"
The other visits can be by video
"If not, you should ask her if she can refer you to someone who is able to see you in person at least as needed"
"But, it should still be awhile yet until you have to get that figured out. "
Serious question here: How does the pharmacist know if you've had an in person visit or not? Do they call your doctor to ask?
DEA just extended the existing rule for another year
No in-person appointment is required
"https://www.mha.org/newsroom/dea-extends-telemedicine-rule-for-controlled-substances-through-2025/#:~:text=The%20Drug%20Enforcement%20Administration%20(DEA,through%20Dec.%2031%2C%202025."
Why can’t you change pharmacies?
What pharmacy was this?  I use CVS and my doctor is telehealth only
 He has offices in FL and CT (where I live) but I think he is primarily in FL now so in person is impossible
This is making me a bit worried.
"Try asking the pharmacist for the names of the local doctors who are on your insurance, who do in person appointments, and who prescribe your medication"
"If they can’t provide that information, speak with their regional manager about their no longer accepting your prescription"
"

Also look into moving your prescription to another pharmacy"
"What they’re doing is wrong, since you have a valid prescription."
Call the Pharmacy Board of your state to be clarification on the matter.
"Are you currently using a telehealth platform like Circle? If so, the pharmacy may just be flagging the large telehealth-only apps and not brick-and-mortar offices that only do telehealth.

It sucks because Circle has been lifechanging for me with regard to my ability to keep appointments, communicate with providers, and stay on my meds specifically because of the app"
"(The way it automatically sets up appointment notifications so I don't have to enter them myself, I can cancel/reschedule in the app without calling anyone, and the patient portal.) But CVS won't fill my prescriptions because they don't fill scripts from ""primarily telehealth"" practices, but they would if I went to a local brick-and-mortar practice that only offers telehealth appointments."
"The issue is between the psychiatrist and the pharmacist- let your psychiatrist know ask them to liaise with the pharmacy.

If you"
"Can you do an in person appt with the psychiatrist you are seeing now and then just once a year so it’s not strictly telehealth.

Also, if the psychiatrist does in person too, how would the pharmacy know? Plenty of people see a doctor an hour away. "
How did they know the appointment was through telehealth?
"You have three options: 

Speak with your  psychiatrist and if there's no resolution, get a new one"
"(She may be able to give you a referral).

Speak with your insurance.

Get a different pharmacy.

Good luck."
"How the hell do they know what kind of visits you're having? Is it possible for your provider to mail you a paper Rx to bring these fools?

Edit: I see, reread, these providers only do telehealth"
"I wonder if you could make an ADA complaint, as this seems like it should be illegal."
"As others have said, the DEA was trying to revert back to old rules requiring in person visits for prescriptions for controlled substances"
 Large pharmacy chains are preparing for the possible rule change
Apparently the rule change was pushed back again.
I only see my psych in person once or twice a year because she’s like 3 hours away
"I used to use a local mom and pop pharmacy, now I use the mail order one from my insurance company"
Never an issue with either
"If you’re using a chain pharmacy run quickly, they’re the worst."
"Have you tried talking to your PCP? mine referred out to evaluate for adhd, but she was more than willing to take over med management after i had a diagnosis and some preliminary results"
How does the pharmacist know you see them via telehealth?? My mom’s a pharmacist and I’ve never heard of this
They aren’t concerned with how you saw your doctor just that a doctor did consult with you and wrote a prescription that you need
"Also, try going to your GP and telling them the issue"
My GP writes my scripts after I got a diagnosis from a psychologist
"He didn’t diagnose me, just helps with my medication"
A lot do GPs do.
I have no issues in Maryland where NPs can prescribe medications
What state are you in?
"maybe fine a local service other then psychology today if you wanted to find a in person therapy if you can't change pharmacies, see if you can call your partners clinic for recommendations, thats how I found my in person therapist, though it did take a few weeks,"
Part of why I gave up trying to use stimulants and I’m now trying Straterra
So much bullshit.
"In the US, no tele-doc can write an Rx for a stimulant"
Ryan Haight Act
"One needs regular checkups, including blood tests, to ensure the person is taking their meds as directed."
This
"There is a locally owned pharmacy that is 15-20 mins away from me, much farther than the closest giant-chain pharmacies, but the longer trip is worth it because the locally owned business can work with me a lot easier when a problem pops up"
"They even do compounding, although I've never had a need for that.

If there's a pharmacy like this anywhere near OP, I bet they'll be happier with them."
Right?! My psychiatrist just went on mat leave and there were zero issues with her prescribing me 12 months worth of refills (3 of which on controlled substances)
I cringe when I see what hoops so many other people have to go through just to get the medications they need to survive comfortably.
It didn’t used to like this
"Not until recently, at that"
There are few prescribers (see: “cerebram”) that fucked it over for everyone
"I remember the US being substantially more lax on adhd meds than canada the last time i was living there (but prescribed in the US and my family would send me my scripts bc canada didn’t allow/prescribe the immediate release adderall, which i was on)"
"They don’t even give it out much here either because again, people ruined it for those of us who need it"
:/
It’s a pharmacy policy (and maybe liability) problem not a regulation problem.
Can I as an American buy the meds I need in Canada?   Do I need a prescription?   Thanks.
This is because they use the Place of Service to comply with the restrictions
It’s still technically telehealth but you were in the office setting.
Yep! My 8 yr old sees her psych via video
Once a year we have to go to the hospital to the psych dept to see her psych in the office- on video
"

Ped Psychs are hard to find so the hospital has figured out how to bring professionals to our rural area."
This OP
"It sucks to find an in-person provider on such short notice, we all understand how awful that is"
This comment above is true
Where I am they are enforcing that
I missed an appointment and did a virtual one instead
My prescription was filled but I was warned that in-person visits once a month is being required again.
oh no….
I don’t know if it’s a formal database or they just remember certain prescribers names.
I had the same question.
"I can, I feel it’s a hassle and I don’t even know if it’s just Rite Aid or everyone"
This one is 2 mins from my home and I still forget to pick up my meds
The next closest one is 10 mins away and is CVS.
Same
And mine doesn't take insurance from either so a monthly visit would be a huge setback
The wait for any other provider I have called is crazy
Ugh
I also think my Dr
Fibs a little about how much he's in CT or FL
No pharmacy is going to have that information
"That's a question for the insurance company.

This is prolly tied to the change mentioned lower about DEA regulations for CII medication"
I get my circle medical prescriptions filled at Walmart
"not op, but it’s my state’s regulations that don’t allow for virtual appointments for schedule 2 controlled substances, not any specific pharmacy"
No it’s just a standalone provider
She does telehealth only lately.
The prescription includes place of service or place of treatment
It’s also part of the claims
So they can get the info from the insurance company
I don’t know
Maybe he assumed?
I did ask once
"She’s a great PCP because her approach is European and she’s very old, she takes an hour with each patient for each appointment and really goes in depth talking about issues etc"
However being older and European she doesn’t seem to believe in adhd nor does she think the meds are appropriate
"

One appointment I arrived almost late and I was super anxious because I had been running non stop"
"I rushed to take my kids to school in one area, daycare in another (30 mins drive), then rushed to my first job (45 mins away) for a one hour appointment then rushed to the doc and afterwards had to rush to my second job for my afternoon shift (also 30 mins drive) without a single break in between and no time to sit or eat"
That was the background
"I arrived almost on time but I had stressed about making it on time and not being late for work afterwards.

It was the first time she saw me since I was pregnant, and my kid was then 18 months"
Obviously I wasn’t 160lbs anymore I was back to my pre pregnancy weight of 120lbs
"She immediately blamed my meds (at the time addedal and I also have hypothyroidism and take meds for that, and still have symptoms of it) for me seeming a little scattered and having lost weight.

The time I asked her to prescribe my meds due to my doc being away, she sent me a long message about how she didn’t think I needed those meds, that they were highly addictive, that I should be referred to a neurologist if I have any memory issues (I was telling her I lose everything and also forget all my appointments hence why I needed my meds and not miss a dose)"
I did respond to her and was pretty mad at her in my response because it showed she was ignorant and I have suffered from this since I was a kid.
I wonder if it’s because her address isn’t in my city and since the name was unfamiliar to him (🤦‍♀️) he assumed it was
He even told me he had no clue where the city was
I was telling him it’s an hour away…
not MD evidently
"I’ve never been able to find any psychiatrists, I don’t know how to do that."
That’s not accurate
The link below explains why
"Many telehealth providers can still prescribe if they meet the criteria, which most do"
"

https://www.hhs.gov/system/files/hhs-telemedicine-dea-final-508compliant.pdf"
Damn
I have in-person visits but my psychiatrist has to send a new script in every month
"The pharmacist says “because it’s a schedule 2 drug you’ll always need a new script, no refills”"
It’s a bit less draconic - it isn’t anarchy
"Yes, of course you’d need a prescription"
You will find it very difficult to get one without an established patient-doctor relationship
Walk-in clinics also very rarely prescribe controlled medications.
Where is that even recorded in their system?
Which restriction are you referring to?
Rural fam represent!
"Dang, yall are having to do monthly visits? I’m still on once every 3 months"
Hope that doesn’t change for me.
See if your insurance has a mail provider they partner with
"Mine does with Optum Rx, I was insistent I couldn’t do it with my insurance until my psychiatrist said he has other patients under the same insurance use it.

I got a 60 day supply each of IR and ER doses, for half the price I was paying for a 30 day supply at CVS"
"Seriously, check your insurance and I hope you are happily surprised."
Try a local pharmacies
The corporate owned ones are total crap and have weird ass policies.
Try a hospital pharmacy
Chain pharmacies SUCK
i’m in CA and haven’t had any issues with CVS
I use Walmart pharmacy
No problems so far.
"It's Rite Aid because they got in trouble for not policing pain meds better, so now they must be cracking down to avoid similar issues with ADHD meds."
"Now see, I never had an issue with RiteAid, but Walmart told me not unless I have an in person visit"
Shouldn’t these big chains be consistent across locations?
"Not a pharmacy, but a pharmacist knows the names of the few doctors they are filling while excluding the rest."
How does the pharmacy know that it’s telehealth?
Prescriptions don’t include place of service
" How would pharmacies have access to someone’s medical claims?  This never came up the entire time I worked in insurance.

Regulations like this are usually enforced at the provider level, not by the pharmacy."
ahhhh bummer
"I found every one local, and found there website, and most had some sort of intake form"
"They told me they didn't have any opening, and gave me more suggestions"
"I also had talked to a depression counselour for a few years, and she gave me suggestions, and the person who diagnosed me gave me some"
" I also ended up with an ASD diagnosis, and there is an autism section at a local hospital that had people there that could help, they got me incontact with a service that I'm still getting emails from people from now that I found someone.

  
It was tough for a few weeks, and I could only stand to look for like 15-30 minutes at a time, but once I got into one of these services it got easier."
Did you read what you posted? Please read again and if things are still unclear
I'm sure we can continue this conversation until we get to the correct answer
Remember...a correct answer isn't always the right answer
And the right answer isn't always correct.
"I think that's true for moronic DEA reasons, but last time, my doctor postdated the prescriptions and sent them all together, and my Walgreens seemed fine with that"
You could try asking yours if that's fine
"Of course, annoyingly they still didn't bother to fill it until I specifically asked them to"
It's not like I have an executive function disorder that makes inane worthless tasks difficult to remember or anything
"Oh wait...



It makes no sense to me, since if I only talk to my doctor once every 90 days, why does it matter when they do the paperwork? And how is this any different than getting refills? It's not the 1980s where I could steal a prescription pad and write my own orders for whatever I want"
"The pharmacy has to record every time I buy things, so I wouldn't be able to trick them all into filling the same prescription for me."
It’s the law in the US
Refills are not allowed on controlled substances
The doctor probably wrote 12 months in advance and has her staff send them in once a month
That’s what my doctor does.
"I need a new script every time too (Netherlands), but it's super straightforward - I leave a message on my GP's answering machine, they send an electronic prescription to my pharmacy the same day (the assistant does most of the work, the doctor just formally signs off on it, but as long as it's ""same as last month"", they probably don't look at it for more than 2 seconds), and I get a pickup notification from them when they have it, which is typically within 1-2 business days"
"It was recommended to me that I should come back to the GP for a checkup once a year, and get my blood pressure checked once a month or so, but none of that is required, just recommended.

Oh, and of course my (mandatory) health insurance covers the whole thing."
We lucked out that a small hospital started in the 1800’s has continued to grow
They’re a research hospital so they attract the best and the brightest for awhile and bc of that they’re able to offer amazing care
"

Just the luck of the rural draw."
You can get them by mail? Everyplace I've ever talked to says they have to be picked up in person because they're schedule 2.
A pharmacist (and most techs) would know the doctors in the immediate area - not what insurances they take.
No idea 🤷‍♀️
It may vary by state but I know for some the provider has to indicate on the prescription if it’s a telehealth
CMS introduced rules during COVID allowing telehealth providers to prescribe controlled drugs
The allowances has been extended a couple of times
"It currently expires the end of this year.

For some states standard codes such as the POS are used, otherwise the rendering provider is supposed to include the information of where the patient is for the session"
"

But I know there are conflicting and unclear rules/guidance as well."
lol I did…
Did you? Here’s some more links if you need them
"When Covid hit, the government provided exemptions to the Ryan Haight Act, and those extensions have been extended, most recently through December 2025"
"So as of now, yes you can get prescribed controlled substances via telehealth, including stimulants"
"

I’m Canadian and thankfully it’s different here.
Dang! That is good luck
The closest hospital to us is a 20 minute drive and it's generally considered the place you go to die
Lol
It depends on the state.
OP says in the post that the pharmacist said “that plenty of people on (OP’s) insurance have in person visits.” So the pharmacist should be able to say which doctors those are.
"“ For some states standard codes such as the POS are used, otherwise the rendering provider is supposed to include the information of where the patient is for the session.”

Include where?  Where is that information being stored?  I’m asking because that’s seriously not a thing in pharmacy systems that I know of.

The documentation is usually done at the provider level not the pharmacy level."
Thank you! In details you are correct
"I misspoke by saying, ""Can't"""
"They can and if they are associated with an in-state DEA license, AND the patient has had at least 1 person annually"
"Additionally, in a situation where one would need stimulant pills, a new local Rx needs to written when no in-person visit, etc."
"Note: they never told us it was the pharmacist, they simply said the pharmacy called"
"Pharmacists aren't making those phone calls, technicians are"
Source: I worked in pharmacy for 12 years in 3 separate states for 2 different chains
"

The pharmacy will know what doctors take in-person appointments"
They will not know if those doctors are covered by OP's insurance coverage..
which was the entire point of my og comment
"Even if 2 people are working in the same place, their insurances could be diff based on what package they choose"
Those can have different in/out of network doctors based on certain choices made.

Will you show up on time if you're allowed to come in later? Unless you change your own habits you'll just be late for the adjusted time
I'd recommend acting like your start time is 30 minutes earlier than it really is to compensate for your lateness.
What else have you done to try to address being late? This is what you need to do first
Then when you’ve exhausted all options you could try to get a Drs note that could be used for accommodation.
"I have to wonder if getting an accommodation would even help.

Unless I'm totally missing something, this is about you not getting up on time"
"There's not something physically stopping you, or some conflicting schedule.

So if you knew that you could get there at 8:30 instead of 8:00 and it's fine, wouldn't 8:30 become the ""new normal"" for you, and you'd find yourself arriving after that multiple times a year?

I know nothing about the legality of this, but I'd be shocked if any doctor would back it up"
"

Not knowing your type of work, but would your boss approve of a time shift so you work the correct number of hours, but you start later? Maybe that would help you mentally? 

Also, just a suggestion that may be dumb.."
"Have you added a sun temperature lamp on a timer? If your issue is that you need daylight to get moving, have a sun lamp wake you up on time!"
I have a flexible schedule but I choose to work early
I’m always late to work
"Unfortunately if you move your time, you’re still going to be late for work"
My advice is to get more than 8 hours of sleep
Sometimes I would get into bed at 7:30 and make it a habit
"Even if I snoozed, I was well rested to get up early"
Some other tips are to prepare the night before
Have your clothes picked out ready to go
"Lunch packed and everything in your bag like keys, wallet, etc."
Im sorry but getting a legal accommodation for not getting to work on time is insane
At a certain point you need to accept responsibility for yourself and figure this out.
"I feel you, OP! The only way to deal with this is to make yourself INDISPENSABLE"
"
By what you are saying,  you already have.
I suggest you don't bring it up before they do.
I have an ADHD friend that addresses this by saying "" we are not surgeons here"" at her boss"
She is a designer in a casino..
not a surgeon indeed.
"I'll always aim for the actual starting time, I'm justing asking for the opportunity to make up for lost time during breaks instead of disciplinaries"
I can't get out of bed until the latest possible time where I could make it into work on time
"I always cut it too close and sometimes I'm late cos of unexpected traffic.

I've tried setting my alarm 3 hours before starting time but I just keep snoozing the alarm.

I've tried moving my alarm to the other side of the room hoping that getting out of bed will wake me up enough but I just jump back into bed"
"I even moved the alarm to under the bed but it still doesn't work.

Sometimes I turn the alarm off while I'm still asleep instead of snoozing it"
And I have no memory of it
"I'm not asking for adjusted hours cos I'll still be late.

I'll always aim for the official starting time, I'm just asking for leniency to allow me to make up for any lost time during breaks"
"I prepare everything the night before, always have done.

I hope in the future the working culture becomes enlightened enough to judge employees on their performance and ability to get their job done for the day, not for their punctuality"
"True words, if I didn't do the job as well as I do, I would've at least been on my final warning if not fired.

I haven't had any warnings yet, they tried and I successfully fought back with my workers rights.
But I have no more tricks to help me"
They're saying you need to aim for earlier
"If your start time is 8:30, you need to aim to be there at 8"
"Incentivize it if you need to, like getting breakfast someplace nearby"
"I struggle hard with getting up in the morning too, so I really feel you, but you have to stop looking at it as an impossible ask"
"There are two problems with asking for accommodation:


1"
"It's got to be a *reasonable* accommodation, and in most jobs it's not reasonable to allow employees to be late"
"You have to be there on time, or tasks you're responsible for are delayed, or work you should be doing is unfairly put on your coworkers, or customers aren't dealt with in a timely fashion, etc"
"I don't know what job you have, but unless it's something that has you working completely independently with no client interaction, being late isn't going to fall under a reasonable accommodation"
"Even if it might, that could cause some moderate to serious morale issues with your coworkers if you're allowed to be late and they're not. 


2"
"If you are given an accommodation, how likely are you to start accidentally abusing it? If your start time is 8:30 but you're allowed a 30 minute arrival window without penalty, how long until your start time is 9 in your mind? Because then you'll be late for *that*.


You have to solve this problem yourself, man"
"It's hard and it sucks, but a permanent late pass isn't the answer"
Lie to yourself
Lie to yourself *hard*
"Whatever your official start time is, you make yourself believe that it's really 30 minutes earlier. "
"what time do you go to bed? i always thought i could never have a job with typical office hours, but then i got on sleep meds"
"reliably being able to fall asleep within 90 minutes of taking them changed my life, and i could actually wake up in the mornings.

also want to mention that proving you have a disability doesn’t guarantee your job has to accommodate it, if what you’d require interferes too drastically with their operations"
"if a job mostly involved in person customer interactions and you had agoraphobia, they might not be required to let you work from home, even with documentation, if they said it was completely necessary for the job"
ditto if you had physical limitations that prevented you from performing essential job duties
"

it’s **possible** your job could successfully argue that they can’t reasonably accommodate this request, even if you think that’s BS.

trust me i’ve been where you are, but it’s really not hopeless"
you can also set an alarm to take your meds 90 minutes before you actually need to be awake
"i did that back when i had a shitty sleep schedule and it naturally woke me up enough that i could hear my alarms and get myself up pretty painlessly.

if you can’t do these things or are unwilling to try other options (alarms with vibrators that shake your bed, alarm apps that require you to do complete activities before the sound stops, or anything on the MANY threads in this sub on the topic), you might want to consider a job with more flexible hours"
Mannn reading this I thought it was something I typed because I am going EXACTLY through this
My snooze is set to go off every 2 minutes and i do this for about an hour before getting up at the last possible minute
It's gotten so much worse over the last year (mental health in general declining as well) but like WHY CANT I GET OUT OF BED?? I've even gotten written up for it lately and it's STILL not enough motivation(?) to get out of bed on time
I'm not coherent enough as I'm waking up to even comprehend my situation to think about getting fired
"And then I stare at the time frozen in bed telling myself ""I need to get up I need to get up I need to get up"" but I just CAN'T"
But yeah..
"all that to say is I feel your pain.

Not sure if you take stimulant meds for adhd but one thing I've been trying lately is setting an alarm about an hour before having to get up, sleepily taking a ritalin on my night stand with a few good gulps of water, and letting myself go back to sleep until another alarm goes off in 30~ minutes"
By then I wake up a bit more alert as these snoozes go off and it's kindof been helping me with getting up
It has been a bit of trial and error adjusting the time-frames though.
Been there
You know what helped? My doctor
"Turns out I was exhausted because I had poor sleep quality, an Autoimmune disorder and vitamin D and iron deficiency.

It's a lot easier for me to get out of bed now"
"I also set an alarm for about an hour before wake up time, take my concerta and go back to sleeping"
"When my actual alarm goes off an hour later, my med is kicking in and everything goes a lot smoother."
I totally hear you! We are not all made equally
"There are jobs like that, try your best at this one and find a company that supports that."
"I appreciate your comment mate.

For clarification, my job doesn't have any direct communication with clients"
"I just have to finish my work before a certain time towards the end of my shift.

I am the only person that does my job, nobody covers for me when I'm not there"
There is nothing in my job that needs to be finished within the first 30 minutes or even the first hour.
Which sleeping meds do you take? Any ill-effects?
"Forgot to mentain that I'm profoundly deaf so I have a vibrating alarm since normal alarms won't wake me for obvious reasons.
 And the doctor prescribed me with sleeping pills that I take at 9pm every night, I usually fall asleep around 10.30pm.

I also take sertraline (zoloft) to treat my depression, I take them with the sleeping pills.
Before I took the sleeping pills I would only get around 2-3 hours of sleep, now I can get a solid 7-8 hours sleep which has made a huge difference to my mental health.

But only my ADHD is too blame for my punctuality"
There's still the likelihood of your coworkers resenting you getting special treatment and how it's likely to go wrong
It's also pretty reasonable for people to just expect that you arrive at the time you said you'd be there
"The accommodation isn't likely to be granted, and it's probably not going to work out as well as you want even if you do somehow get it."
i take clonidine and i recommend it very highly
i was on and off a lot of sleep meds when i was younger and nothing even compared to this
"its a beta blocker which is a blood pressure medication, it basically just drops your blood pressure until you fall asleep"
"i like it because i can’t “fight off the sleep,” it just makes me so tired i zonk"
"the only change is physical, no mental affects"
it isn’t addictive and really doesn’t have adverse affects other than dizziness
"i do need to stand up very slowly while on it, and i try to be in bed before it fully hits.

it typically takes 30-90 minutes to hit for me"
"

lmk if i can answer anything else! i’m also a huge advocate for propranalol, another beta blocker"
"it’s for panic (the sensation of physical anxiety/heart racing, versus ‘thinking anxiety.’) i take it each morning with my meds, plus some as needed for other panic."
"if the ADHD is the only thing to blame for your punctuality, why do you think your lateness wouldn’t shift to your new start time? you wrote that right now the issue is that your ADHD is making you dawdle to the ‘last possible second,’ and sometimes your time estimate is off"
"if your brain knows you have that buffer, the time blindness, delaying waking up, and not getting ready and out the door fast enough will just adjust"
I think you should talk to your Dr about this
Do you take any stimulants? That might be what your brain needs to kick start you in the morning
"
But also maybe the sleeping tablets are too much - might be worth revisiting your dose"
It may be making you sleep way too deep in the morning
"
Also, try tracking your sleep so you can see what your sleep cycle is tracking like"
"REM, wake time etc."
Yeah that's true.
I'm just at a loss at what to do
"Thank you! I can’t stop my brain, so it’s HARD to fall asleep"
"Not anxiety or bad stuff; I just think about everything, like where I want to go on vacation"
I just can’t stop thinking.
With my proposed adjustments I would have to cover for any lost time by cutting into my breaks or staying late..
"which I hate doing.

I'll always aim for 8am like always, I'm just asking for leniency to keep my job and continue doing good work for them"
"It seems like you've pretty well determined that your problem is unfixable, which is self defeating and counterproductive"
And frankly (I say this with love and real personal experience with the same struggle) it's pure bullshit
"ADHD absolutely makes it really freakin hard to get out of bed and do anything in a timely fashion, but you're not a robot running ADHD OS that you can't patch a timeliness update on"
"You're a human, adaptable and responsible for your own problems"
"You just have to do the mental work.


Honestly I'd chuck the despair in the trash ASAP, adopt a healthy fear of unemployment, and lie like hell to yourself about your start time"
"Anxiety can be very motivating and a focused, purposeful delusion that your start time is earlier than it is will go a long way"
Enlist a friend to help wake you or to brainstorm ways to motivate you to get to work early if you have to
But you *have* to stop thinking that getting out of bed is an unsolvable problem and take responsibility for yourself.
"You need to get there early, I can almost guarantee that if you are allowed to show up at 9:00 instead of 8:30 for instance, you'll just start getting up half an hour later than you already do"
It won't fix your problem
"You need to understand your limitations and plan ahead to work around them.

And here's how I can prove it to you: there's nothing stopping you from getting up 30 minutes earlier than you already are if you pretend like you need to be there at 8"
"Get an accountability buddy if you need to, maybe get coffee with a friend an hour before work so you're a few minutes late to coffee instead of being late to work."
i have the same thing
"a lot of docs try to give you meds to “quiet your brain” when this is your issue but i really don’t like stuff with mental effects like that, and they always have way more side effects"
this accomplishes quieting my brain by just knocking me out
"and bc i can’t fight it off, even if i don’t “want to sleep” or stop fucking around, i need to sleep"
God dang that's a great comment
It made me think.
"Thanks for your reply.

But I can't imagine how I'd get an accountability buddy to help.

Basically you're saying that I should take responsibility for my own punctuality"
"Despite being a super performa, my predecessor used to achieve under 50% of his job priorities"
After my first month I achieved 87% of job priorities
Sounds great
I might try it
Thank you.
I hope it helped
"It's really important to remember that this is a process and something you just keep doing, not a one-and-done"

"And I realized that SOME of my failures happened not because of me as I once believed, but because others failed me.

Failure doesn’t have to be the end"

This outlook pushed me through some incredibly hard times

I can use those failures to build a better world for my children"

"Hey, hang in there"
I also was on sertraline first and that didn’t work right
Wellbutrin didn’t work right either— it felt good the first few days like you said but then made me weirdly on edge and agitated all the time
I am now on lamotrigene which is a mood stabilizer and that seems to be helping after upping my dose like 4 times in the past year
"I thought it was useless but I think it’s helping.

Wellbutrin personally did very little for my ADHD really"
"I started taking strattera which is also an anxiety/ADHD med i’m pretty sure, and it has been noticeably helpful after a couple months"
"It’s not a stimulant, but I think it’s finally targeting what i need instead of making me a jittery distracted anxious mess

My point is hang in there! the chemicals that are causing those feelings are different in everyone and each med works in a different way so it only makes sense that most people need a lot of trial and error"
I am on trintellix for my clinical depression/major depression and it's the first med since I was 13 to remove the thoughts of death
Life changing
Those are antidepressants.
Wellbutrin is not an officially approved treatment for ADHD
"It is prescribed off label and SOME people have reported a positive effect on ADHD symptoms, but if you search in here you'll find most people (including me) found it to be ineffective for ADHD symptoms"
"I still take it for depression though 

If you suspect ADHD is the cause of the depression and anxiety then why not try an ADHD medication rather than antidepressants...?"
"Thank you, I really appreciate you getting back to me on this"
"I really hope that after my depression and anxiety gets leveled out, that we explore other classes of non stimulant ADHD meds like Strattera!"
I think right now we're trying to manage the anxiety and depression since Wellbutrin failed
Psych was hoping wellbutrin would hit two birds (depression and possible adhd) but it didn't treat both
"

I'm hoping that once that's managed we can revisit the adhd options."

I feel so stupid. I can’t do anything to a good standard.

"Due to the type of medication Strattera is, (non stimulant SNRI) it has to be taken consistently every day around the same time in order for it to reach full effect"
For most people this can take 1-2 months
It's metabolized differently than stimulants and takes time to cross the blood-brain barrier and build up in your blood stream
"If it's giving you too much nausea and drowsiness let your doc know, I had these same issues when I tried it out and found it wasn't the fit for me and switched to Concerta.

Speaking of, you mentioned you also take Concerta sometimes which is a long-acting form of the same active ingredient in ritalin which is a stimulant, these work basically instantly and can be taken ""as needed"" (which could be every day) but you can safely take breaks from it if need be"
Strattera you cannot take breaks or stop taking it cold turkey or there could be bad side effects (similar as stopping an antidepressant cold turkey)
You have to taper yourself off of Strattera through the help of your doctor.

ADHD newbie here
From some of the research I’ve been doing it seems like you can get sudden bursts of motivation when external factors (other people/situations) come into play
"It’s easy to keep your desk at work clean because other people are bound to see it, and god forbid they see you with a messy desk"
"Whereas at home, especially if you’ve shut yourself in, there are no external factors to provide that motivation.

Im sure there is a better way to phrase this or maybe even a technical term for this phenomenon"
What has worked for me in the past has been going against the grain and inviting people over
This suddenly apply pressure and consequences attached to a specific and real due date
Kicks your brain into gear and blaze through some clean up
It’s not a permanent fix by any means but it’s a lot easier to do minor cleaning but by bit with a pomodoro timer than dig yourself out of that hole.
"I know this sounds kinda silly, but some things that get me in the headspace to clean are 
- go to a friend's house and their house being really clean, so I feel like mine has to be too 
- watching people clean and the results on tiktok
- pretending I'm in a YouTube video and cleaning for my followers, lol 
- wanting to have friends over but being too embarrassed
- telling myself i HAVE to do it and giving myself time to mentally prepare (over a couple of days)
-Listening to sad music makes me clean aswell hahah


I still struggle a lot with this myself, but lately, these things have made me clean some things, and hopefully, this starts to become regular"
Good luck!
"Nothing compares to the stress of knowing my parents are drop in! But seriously, external pressure is often a driving force for me"
"Inviting people over once a fortnight could give you the push to do it fortnightly and then it won’t build up so much.

When it comes to rubbish specifically, I’d recommend having a bins that are visible and don’t have a lids"
Put a bin EVERYWHERE you usually dump your rubbish/create the rubbish
I really mean everywhere
Not having a lid is also a visual reminder of it getting full and will get to the point of rubbish not fitting in

It kind of sounds like it’s too high of a dose
I only feel a crash if it’s too much and cut back
I noticed this when they increased my meds after I had been out
I was awake for about 3 days without getting anything done besides over thinking about everything
I’m almost sure I was manic
I just dropped it back down
It might also be your extended release is being taken too late in the day so it’s not dropping down low enough around bed time
"

Maybe talk to your doctor if it continues or eventually your tolerance will adjust to it after a month or so"
But personally I’d rather drop the dose down and build up so the meds work better at a lower tolerance.

Hey I'm 37 M
" I admitted myself before, they gave me different medication for the week I was there"
 I eventually went back to my doctor and went back on Adderall
" I also did outpatient for coocuring disorder.

Get the help you need."
From my experience they will absolutely not give you any stimulants or benzos inpatient
"They're going to take care of you, though, I've been inpatient many times for the same reason"
The rule of thumb is that if you feel unsafe from yourself to just go
And it sucks but they'll offer you anything else they can and you will be safe
" 
  
Make sure to gather up clothing without belts or strings and several books"
"Even better, have someone with access to your things before you go"
"Best wishes, I know how it is.."
Despite the lack of my normal meds they always take great care of me.
It's good to hear that they gave you an alternative
"If you don't mind me asking, what medication alternative did they give you?"

If I have something important to do I’ll start with a simple task that I know feels rewarding and then just keep going from there with whatever task feels doable next
"For example I’ll make my bed first then maybe I’ll bring the dirty dishes downstairs from my room, then unload the clean dishes and next thing you know my kitchen is clean, im doing my laundry, doing homework, etc"
This makes my time I spend relaxing feel more rewarding also
"

Also sometimes if I start my day by doing one productive simple task it snowballs throughout my day"
But if I start my day on my phone scrolling or playing games it’ll be what I want to do all day.

I don't feel like any meds work

It may have not caused the depression
"I have adhd, anxiety, and depression"

My area of special interest was health care
I became a nurse
" Was damned good at it, too"
 Did it for 37 years.
Don’t worry about statistics
You have to try first to know how it would turn out
I’ve just been diagnosed after working full time for 5 years and completing grad school
It’s not impossible
You just have to learn strategies that can help you stay focused
"For me it’s using calendars (I use 3 one in the office, one at home, and one on my phone lol) I take a lot of notes too and break down my tasks in order to really understand what I’m supposed to do (even with drawing)"
"Lastly, doodling, playing with something like a pen or a stress ball, listening to something..etc all help me as well while doing my tasks.

Good luck, you can do it!"
Thanks for your reply and thank you for being a damned good nurse! I’m new on here so I’m pretty sure my post doesn’t show up as widely as those with more karma
"If you don’t mind my asking, are you/were you ever medicated for your ADHD-C?"

I'm on day 7 now
 I am trying to decide if I should ask my doctor for Adderall instead.
"I think it differs for everyone, I just took my first dosage of 18 mg of concerta er a few days ago"
I just experienced a slight headache for 1-1.5 hr
"I find that I'm more or less still adhd with or without it, definitely need a higher dosage."
Hey there!! I hope it goes well for you
"Like another poster said, these meds vary widely for everyone"
"My son was on concerta for years, and did wonderful! I tried it and turned into a crazy person...so obviously different results"
"😂 

I've tried many meds over the years and finally settled on Jornay PM"
"It's worked wonders for me! 

I hope this one is good for you, though! Meds can be so helpful in figuring out our everyday lives with ADHD."
"It's definitely different for everyone, i was on lots of other different meds that made me depressed and underweight, but I started concerta 2 years ago, and it's been the best one I've tried"
I take 54mg
"The only thing is I feel like I'm kinda immune if that even makes any sense, and I think I need more because I feel like I could be more switched on than I am currently.
You may feel a lack of appetite at the beginning, but it definitely dies down over the months"
I also forced myself to eat so that I wasn't underweight again
"
You may not feel it till a couple weeks in - just as your body kinda gets used to it"
"
You may also need to change your dose so that it suits you"
"
Good luck!"
"Hey!! I think it’s going amazing, today, about an hour after I took it I started to nice major changes within my mentality"
"I can think clearer, I’m able to withstand impulsive thoughts, and I can talk much better than before and actually hold a conversation without overthinking my words."
"I don't know if this was the concerta or just maturity over time, but I feel like I have a lot more mental control than I did years ago"
"I can control thoughts, actions, and emotions way better, and I feel like I'm more open-minded"
But it may just be me growing up and my brain developing lol

Should I use ADHD medication prior to getting ADHD testing?

Strange they put you on meds before diagnosis
but you might not want to take it day of just to be safe
You could also ask the place doing the test to see what they think
I'm not a psychiatrist but I would say to not take your straterra for your testing
I just got off strattera and today is my 3rd day without taking it and its completely out of my system
It helped with my cognitive functioning A LOT and I'm not sure I would've tested positively (or it wouldn't have been as severe) had I been on it when I got tested
"Everyone is different, but I don't think your test results will reflect your raw brain lol"
"And you want to refer back on those test results in case you ever want to take a different medication, because you might not take strattera forever."
I think it’s because it’s a non-stimulant so they didn’t wait till a diagnosis from a psychologist to prescribe the med.
Would you recommend temporarily taking instant release stimulants on some days to help with focus
And then on the day of the test I wouldn’t take it and it wouldn’t affect my results? Not sure if it works that way.
Mad respect for your access to ADHD meds but I would just stop the Strattera a few days before your test
If you have access to stimulants I think I'm a little confused on why you're getting tested but I understand wanting a breakdown of your deficiencies or if you want accommodations for school or something
"I have only ever taken Strattera about to start stimulants so I'm not sure the effects stimulants would have, I'd keep trucking on with the Strattera and let it get out of your system before the test"
"It'll suck a little the day before and that day, but you'll still have some focus and concentration on the days you don't take it, today is my 3rd day off and it's completely out of my system."
Na I don’t have access to stimulant meds lmao
I have something that makes it contraindicated for me
"But I was gonna ask the doctor for a low dose and see if they made an exception for me because I don’t wanna fuck up the test.

I need the testing results because I’m gonna have to switch around psychiatrists in the future because my current place is only temporary and I’ll be moving in the future"
So having the test results in hand and showing it to the future psychiatrists who might not want to give me meds would help.
"Ah okay that makes sense! I would def stick with the Strattera and just have a brief detox before, it'll suck not being locked in those few days but it'll be worth it to have those accurate results! Good luck with everything!"
Thank you

What am I if I just stopped functioning :(

This is more than adhd and likely more than anxiety
"I would advise you to go to your primary care provider and ask for a blood workup to see if you have any deficiencies, like iron"
If it’s not dizziness but sudden panic/anxiety you could definitely benefit from anti-anxiety medication or even an inhaler to use as needed for these moments
It’s relatively easy to get an inhaler prescribed but can be harmful if you don’t need it.
"If you're passing out, please see a doctor to rule out anything cardiovascular or respiratory!!"
Sometimes I feel like I wouldn't be surprised if my brain just over loaded and I switched off like someone flicked a switch on a robot
Instant oblivion
"However I just keep choofing along 👌 

Improve homeostasis"
"The better you eat, the more sleep you get, the more active you are, the happier you are"
And your anxiety will show an inversely proportional decline.
"Sounds like a mix of things, maybe anxiety? What you're feeling is quite human tho"
Have you got professional help?
Sounds like you're having panic attacks to me
"

If you feel your heart rate rising or your heart pounding, or feeling general overwhelmed or like you're going to collapse stop what you're doing and take a few deep breaths, 4 seconds in, hold for 4 seconds, controlled breath out for 4 seconds"
"This will slow your heart rate and help you think clearly.


This could also potentially be a medical issue"
"I'd highly suggest you speak to your doctor and get checked out for cardiovascular issues, blood pressure issues etc."
"You become me, and it's not a fun place"
Stay out if you can
"This is anxiety, not adhd"
 It sounds like you really need to talk to your doctor.
It looks like panic attacks
Do you go to therapy? Or did you try some CBT techniques? I’ve been having panic disorder for 5 years now with good and bad periods
Only recently I’ve made myself to start super-focused cbt training
"
You can always use the 5 senses technique, I don’t remember correct name in English"
"When hyperventilating or feeling like you’re about to pass out, wherever you are, you name 5 red objects you see, 4 sounds you hear, 3 surfaces you can touch and so on"
"Me personally, when I was in a subway and was fighting with my own body to stay conscious though it wanted to pass me out, I’ve started counting letters in names of stations, any signs, any written words"
It helped me until the ambulance arrived
Often you are much more nervous before something important than when actually doing it
"I used to make myself crazy before parties or social get-togethers, I couldn't eat anything, had to vomit and all that made me even more nervous because you need to be somewhat healthy to drink and have fun"
"But when I actually got myself to go, in 95% of all cases I was doing just fine and actually had fun"
Medicine helps me be more open and less anxious but you also need to learn to convince yourself you can actually do these things
Yes and my initial diagnosis is adhd and other disorders that I don’t want to list cause it’s long and I forgot😭
The doctor has been out of town so I’ll probably won’t her from her for a couple of months lol😭
Dang
Ooooh I remember reading that some where never really got to try it out when I pass out Its like I’m teleporting from standing up to randomly on the floor
I will try that when it happens again thank you🙂‍↕️🌸
I'd call the clinic she works at and ask to see another doctor there
They'll already have your records on file there so it'll be easier and better than waiting

Wait till just nahhh

"If you managed to get an engineering degree from any University in the USA, you are NOT dumb"
"You may be in a rut, you are probably depressed, but you are not dumb"
"The best advice I ever received from my psychiatrist is this  ""don't be so hard on yourself."" I can be my own worst enemy.

If you are not seeing a psychiatrist, please do so"
"It took me a long time to realize that my ADHD was also causing depression because it was just my ""normal."" Talk to a professional"
"

Also, look up and read a book called ""The Four Agreements."""
I have a non STEM degree and some how ended up surrounded by some of the most prestigious PhDs in the world
"And after layoffs, I have imposter syndrome and now surviver guilt. 

I feel like an idiot every day"
"It feels like everyone else just gets it.

Not saying this is you, but I realized that I use behaving chaotic as a crutch"
"Like, sure, adhd, I’m naturally chaotic"
"But I was leaning into it and that lean made me feel less worthy than I already felt. 

So, my resolution"
I told my manager
I told my team
I acknowledged it’s something I do out of fear
"The idea if I don’t act smart, I don’t need to feel bad because I never really tried"
I took 2 weeks off with the intention of trying to just be calm
And then started back up
My entire team has been supportive
My lead now likes to ask me if I learned anything new (mind you I’m already senior in rank)
And it has made a wild difference
"I still feel like the dumbest person in the room, but now my team is trying to lift me up and keep me from feeling that way. 

Having that support does wonders in confidence and the ability to focus/learn. 

Just wish I had done it sooner.

If you’re an engineer"
You’re smart
You’re capable
Just need to create an environment where you’re allowed to feel that way.
"Are you medicated?

If you are employed I assume you have insurance"
"

Get medicated"
"

If you can’t for some reason - look into CBT and/or regular therapy"
"

Also, you may be making the situation worse in your head"
My buddy wraps himself into knots thinking everybody thinks this or that
For similar reasons you listed
Literally nobody actually thought that.
"Hey, listen, I'm in the same boat: I'm a civil engineer and I had to leave my first two jobs out of college so I wouldn't be  fired"
"You aren't stupid, you're just learning about your strengths and weaknesses"
"We're not born knowing how to get a good job in our field that also suits us, you know?

I took a fantastic job as a design engineer right out of college"
"I excelled as an intern, but when trying to do it full-time I soon fell behind"
I just couldn't crank out work at the speed and accuracy it was expected of me
Some of my colleagues were more understanding than others
One nasty woman in particular berated me both for asking bad questions and not asking enough questions: she completely destroyed my self-confidence at that job
"I had a stairwell I would go to privately cry on the regular.

College trains us to believe that we just need to power through everything to be successful, and if you can't do that, then you're a failure"
"Well nuts to that: if you're sacrificing your mental health to try and keep up at work, you're just eating your own tail and often not even realizing it.

I eventually left the fast-paced world of corporate design and took a job at a city water department, and I LOVE what I do now"
"I inspect pipes, I use utility data to update specs, I go in the field to run tests on public infrastructure"
"It's engaging, it's rewarding; and best of all it's a union job that protects my work-life balance.

Different brains work differently, don't let society feed you this crap about needing to work in a way that fattens corporate America and slowly kills you"
"The world needs your brilliance in ways you haven't even learned about yet, trust me"
"You're not a bad engineer, you just haven't found your niche yet."
Everybody in this thread..
There has never been a time like today when you can carve your own path
"You are intelligent, you are educated, you absolutely have the skill set and resources to find a way to use your skills in a totally different way to build a career that fits only you"
"

So many people are making so much money with nothing going for them but desperation"
"Meanwhile, we get on these paths and end up worse off because we've put ourselves through a system that tells us what we're supposed to come out on the other side as something very specific"
"

That's my rant.

My toxic trait is that while I also think I'm stupid 😂 I also feel like everybody else is too lol so it cancels it all out"
"The same creative process that used to have me starting every hobby on the planet...I use it to create businesses and I force myself to put 90% of my energy into one business while enjoying the distractions of the other 10%

Ok, rant really over this time."
Same
I got an AAS in mechanical from a vocational school because I couldn't cut it at traditional university
"

Ive been at my current job for 3 years, making only $43k a year, and my latest performance review came back as ""less than satisfactory"" because I keep making the same mistakes and missing small details on drawings and plans"
"

This will probably be my last job in any engineering field, whether I get fired or leave voluntarily"
"

Might switch to sales since I hear you don't need a college degree for it, and you can make a lot of money if you're good."
Bro same 😭
I think you have self esteem issues
Take stock man
"You’re obviously not dumb! As trite as it sounds, you appear to be a fish out of water giving yourself a had time for not being able to walk"
"

I was also an engineer and I changed to project management when I was 27! I can’t focus on specifications and spreadsheets for weeks on end and I realised I’m not going to get ahead of the people who can and who enjoy that kind of thing! 

Being a project manager give me lots of different plates to spin and work on! There is always issues for you to react to as well! It’s not perfect, I don’t love it but it pays well with ongoing opportunities"
"If you are an engineer I assume you have at least some disposable income, no? Take some of that money and invest in hiring an ADHD coach or a therapist"
That’s all they do is help people find solutions/ workarounds to their problems or disorders
Are you currently working with a doctor?  Are you taking medication?  Are you doing anything to help lessen the blow ADHD is taking on you?
I'm in the same field
"Estimated 60-80% of kids with ADD have comorbid diseases including ocd, stress, depression and anxiety"
"Often leading into adulthood.

The symptoms overlap for alot of these: headaches, sleep problems, lowered executive function, memory, etc"
"Thankfully a lot of the treatment is the same.

I'm not seen as stupid, though i'm catching up on the things im behind on like school, work, etc.

What helps me is compassion for myself, journal, training, routines, medicin, diet, meditation"
"I dont always do this everyday, but just doing it makes me a  bit better and calm"
No people can do it all
"I want to go to a therapist at some point in the future.

I know you can do this"
Some of the posts of the older people with ADD helped me greatly in realising that sometimes it's a power
"Look up gladteknik.dk, this guy employes 60-80% with people with special needs and him and his staff is doing great.

I can keep telling you things to make you feel better, but all i want to say is be nice to yourself"
People will often treat you like you treat yourself
"It takes some time, but doing little by little Everyday is a great start."

Remember though that no one is normal - even if we struggle more
Your honesty and enthusiasm will count more than you think.
"Software engineer here in a very similar boat until somewhat recently.

First off, if you got a job as an engineer and have a degree you definitely aren’t dumb"
"You will always be your worst critic and remember that it’s always easy to criticize yourself when you’re feeling bad.

One of the biggest things that helped me was getting diagnosed and medication"
And I would HIGHLY recommend them if you haven’t already
"

In the past I would impulsively play games or watch YouTube videos while I was “working” and end up getting distracted and get nothing done"
I once was tasked with reading documentation for a program and I could not read that paper for the life of me
Eventually we dropped it cuz it just didn’t happen
"

Meds won’t fix everything and I probably still won’t want to do some stuff like reading that doc"
But at least I now have the ability to do the stuff I need to and it’s my choice to get distracted and it’s not involuntary.
41 year old aerospace engineer here
"I spent years hating myself for forgetting things, for not knowing things, and generally feeling like I sucked and everyone knew it"
"Here's how I got past it:

1"
Therapy! Therapy therapy therapy
What you're feeling is not your fault
It is not something to be ashamed of
But it sounds like you're in a spiral
"Your mind has latched onto these thoughts and can't let go of them, and it just feeds on itself until it's all-consuming"
"Therapists are GREAT at cutting through the noise.

2"
"Medication was necessary for me, because I lost the genetic lottery and my brain just sucks in so many ways"
So I'm on a few things for the long run
"But it's possible you could use to have an antidepressant for a while to help you stop the spiral and climb out of the hole.

3"
Time
I know that doesn't help in the near term
But your post sounds like you're still relatively early in your career
You've got so much maturing and experience ahead of you
"10 years ago, I *never* would have expected to be where I am now, both emotionally and career-wise.

You can do this"
I believe in you.
"Hye man, I did engineering and I am an army officer"
Both very intense fields
You need to write down EVERYTHING and be a pro at organization
I'm the only one with a notepad and ya know what? I'm the most high speed
You need a self-hate jar and for everytime you call yourself “dumb” put $5 into it and donate it to a charity at the end of the month
"Actually, based on the number of times you insulted yourself in this single post, maybe weekly is enough.

Seek counseling and because this was hard to read."
Get medication if you haven't and therapy and social ADHD coach..asap no excuses I did it
🫂 sighs I am in a similar boat I am in a Medical Biology program but I always get these experiences as well from my peers
All I can say is it gets better and I’m sorry you feel this way and you are not alone.😔
Same haha...so I for medication and it worked for a few weeks till it unmasked my autism and I can’t focus on work for the life of me.
As a Legal Counsel who is working on his second Master's Degree in Law..
I relate to this so much
My qualifications feel meangingless and that I'm always on the verge of screwing everything up

Welp."
">People at work don't treat me well or take me seriously because I come off as naive and uninformed.

I learned a long time ago that people sometimes think that about me when they first meet me, because I'm scatterbrained and *initially* I don't seem to really retain things they tell me.

The thing is, I am very much *not* dumb"
" I also learned that some people *really* don't like finding that out later on.

I suspect that you are also not dumb, but it feels really fucking bad when you're falling behind so I understand why you feel that way"
"

I hope you find your stride"
❤️
Ooooof this was me at work and I got bullied DAILY and was condescended to as well as treated as inferior
 I was literally doing double the workload that my shitty team mates were doing.
"Hi friend, I’m in the same spot as you and I hear you"
"Even with medication, therapy, vitamin D, exercise, asking for help and mentorship, etc"
I’m still feeling the same way so that’s why I can’t offer much but to say you should find the non-judgemental and supportive folks at work and in your life and rely on them
Everybody dumb😂 check their thyroid

Great life!🤩
"Thank you, I’m in a similar mindset as OP and really appreciate your positivity!"
Came to say the same thing also a person with an engineering degree and one of the more challenging ones to get that does not work in engineering
"

I got diagnosed adhd this year and it manifest itself with lack of interest sometimes where it becomes debilitating being able to try and push through doing the work"
I started to see a similar trend this time around so sought help and for the first time started taking medication
I seemed to have avoided the very low depression this time around and continued in my work.
"I'm a Tech Lead for a large company, and I often suffer from imposter syndrome and struggle to maintain a growth mindset. 


By your recommendation, I thought 'what the heck', and on a whim read 'The Four Agreements' the last hour"
"It starts pretty 'out there' and spiritual but becomes very grounded, wise, and practical"
I'm glad I read this book
"It moved me to tears as I self reflected and gave me an important, succinct perspective on how I can change self limiting beliefs. 


Just saying thank you, and +1 this short book to anyone who saw your comment and was on the fence."
Fantastic book.
That sounds like an amazing team to work with
"Count yourself blessed, friend."
"I think if they've kept you during the redundancies even though you don't have a PhD, there's some other qualities that they value in you"
"

I work with a very chaotic woman"
I'm positive she's got ADHD too
"She's got her weakness, but she's also got lots of commitment to getting the job done no matter what and she is very driven to do things fast (which works out really well in about 85% of cases, in the other 15% she shoots herself in the foot)"
"If our management ever has to find a replacement for her, I don't think they'll find someone nearly as committed to the job as her"
I bet you also have some strength outside of your qualification.
I'm in a similar situation
Life was hell until i got into the right environment
I'm doing cutting edge medical research and work some incredible scientists
"I can't focus on a single project like they do, at all"
So my niche is being the person who does the tricky computational part of every project
"I take the data, hyper focus on this novel area, establish good practices for the lab, and move on to the next"
"Every day is new. 


Occasionally I have to do some repetitive task and it's just torture"
I can barely manage
"Those people do this stuff to an incredible quality, every day! If I had to do their work, I'd feel like a huge failure"
"But in reality I get to do what I'm good at, and so I'm a central part of the lab."
"> are you medicated.

One of the most important pieces of (missing) info in these kinds of posts"
It totally does start out hippy dippy! But it is so great!

"If you re not specifically doing it because of music but more because of noise issues, definitely check out LOOP earbuds"
Theyre just earplugs but they work AMAZING
"I own the engage myself, wear them all the time to any public space thats even a bit loud since i struggle with noise issues a lot"
Idk if this helps but yeah check them out
"I own and love the Sony WF-1000XM5 wireless noise cancelling earbuds (I'm not allowed to link apparently, but amazon has 'm)"
"They're comfy and the battery lasts for ages (very good for people who may occasionally forget to charge).

The Loop earplugs mentioned below are very good too, and cheap."
I know you said no $300+ recommendations but I highly recommend Bose Quiet Comfort
They’re actually on sale right now on Amazon for $200
I actually got tears in my ears the first time I put them on after figuring out the adjustment
All sounds were dimmed down and that was without audio/music but noise cancellation on
It was a relief I had never experienced with noise cancelling earbuds
These headphones get me through my day without overstimulation and constant noise input
I even wear them sometimes without music playing in one of my college classes because the professor is too loud and I hear him clearly without the painful pitch
Life changing.
If you use an iPhone the AirPods 2 Prso are the best thing
"I rely on them to deal with small children.

They're on sale for $159 at BestBuy until the end of the day."
I recommend the Beats Solo Pro
"They are super comfortable, the sound quality is good, and the noise cancellation is great"
You can also find some great deals on them—I bought mine used on eBay about a year ago for less than $100
"I use them for working out, running, and working from home"
"I have a small toddler, and they help block out his noise effectively."
I’ve heard rly great things abt the Sony WH-CH720N’s and they are on sale on Amazon 50% off so they are $123 u could read some reviews on those to see if they are what ur looking for
"I have the Beats Studio Buds and wear them constantly, even when I’m not listening to anything haha"
"The only downside is that using the noise canceling feature drains the battery pretty quickly, BUT they’re great at blocking out sound even with noise canceling turned off"
I think mine were $140 but you can probably find some good deals this week
I did! They didn’t work for me at all unfortunately 😔
"I just ordered them for riding my motorcycle, but that's a great idea!!"
I have the XM4 over ear version and like it as well
"Extra plus for over ear: its very visible, which is somewhat of a ""do not disturb me"" signal."
"I actually saw some Bose quiet comfort in Costco earlier today and I wanted to try them out!! Those ones are specifically made for Costco, I think? And I have some $200 or so for free at Costco so if that’s the same one that would be amazing"
"They are the best thing I ever owned.
Finally managed to get my AuDHD partner to try them out and they were like „I’ve been missing out all this time“ and now I don’t have headphones on flights anymore 😅"

I can’t move in the direction I want to

Hey I know this feeling 100%
I can only say what I wish I told my younger self
"

Surround yourself with others that share your ambition"
"
I don’t know if you are on meds or diagnosed etc"
but push for that
"

Doesn’t matter if you try and fail at a lot of things"
Just keep trying new things
What stuck for me was coding
"I started at 26!

Meditate"
"

I know the feeling of being ambitious but not knowing where to focus on"
"
If deep down you know you want to be an actor/director then just fucking do"
Make anything
Act in anything
"

Its really hard but that’s just how we work"

"When you said ""older person"", I thought you were in your 60's! Not 29 turning 30"
I don't think medication would be too late at any age unless the person has health issues.
"I was diagnosed at 29 after having no idea, not even a millisecond of thought my entire life into if I had a mental disorder, did I know that I had ADHD"
"But once I was diagnosed, I decided to not get medicated"
"In my mind, I'd already lived nearly 30 years of my life unmedicated and I didn't see a point since I considered myself ""successful"" in a sense.

But once I learned more about ADHD and myself, I realized that everything about myself that exhausted me, that I considered pathetic, that I had worked for years to try to ""correct"", behaviors I was embarrassed about.."
they were all things I needed medication for
"I wouldn't be able to ""fix"" without medicinal help, my DNA just didn't wire me correctly and it was out of my control.

After I started medication, I found myself no longer struggling to reach everyone else's bare minimum, I could listen better to the people I care about when they spoke to me, my memory was better, I slept better, I didn't have to yell at my brain to do things like it was a foreign body overriding my operating system, I formed habits and learned skills through practice"
"I was able to be who I wanted to be without the fight and the tears and the struggle and the frustration with myself.

If you're scared, don't be.

You deserve to live the same life as everyone else"
"Your daily efforts should have the same value and benefit for you as they do for anyone else in this world, you shouldn't have to struggle while they don't."
"Good god, 30 is not old"
"And yes, it is helpful."
34 years old over here and just recently discovered a medication that works for me
You’re also making us 30+ year olds feel much older than we are lol
30s is not old! It’s never too late! Think about all the days you can finally be productive and motivated! Don’t waste anymore days waiting 😁 medication can help you be your best
I just started meds at 50
I highly recommend it.
30 is not old 😆😆😆 you’re still so young.
"Add another 15 years or so, and the answer is still yes."
"Bruh, you're not old"
"

😂 I get what you're saying"
"I'm female, diagnosed at 32, I think? 4 years ago"
"

Meds have changed my life"
It's been a long road getting here
"Finding the right med, dosage, timing, dealing with side effects, going on breaks, etc"
It's a whole thing
Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it
"And then on day 10 of my break I'm sitting at my desk, thinking of the massive list of tasks I'm behind on at work, home, driving my family mad."
And I remember why I have worked so hard on therapy and meds
"

Totally worth it in my opinion"
"Not always the case, but if you can find the right care team and your family is supportive of your journey, that will help"
"

I would do some research on the different types of meds available now"
There are a lot out there
"Personally, I started on Jornay PM about a year ago and haven't looked back.I also take a non-stimulant, Qelbree, to help with other ADHD symptoms like anger and racing thoughts"
That one is brand new so I'm still figuring out whether I like it or not
" Jornay was the only med that didn't make me angry or make me feel high when I first took it, so I'm partial to that as a stimulant.

Everyone will have different effects on different meds, so you'll probably have to try many before you settle on the right one"
It's a very frustrating process
"

Overall, it's improved my quality of life I think but it hasn't been easy"
"Nothing is easy, really"
I have four kids and I'm in a stage of life where everything just feels like the walls are falling in around me so I need all the help I can get organizing my mind
"🤷 

I think if you go in to your physicians office with a thoughtful plan, they will appreciate the research you've done and know that you aren't just looking to get stimulants for the fun of it"
Good luck and let us know how it goes!
Fark me
"Look at this wise guy, we got an “Older Person” ova here! Sit down grandpa, the only thing worth taking at your age is blood pressure medication and some rest.

You should be fine"
I just started at 41
But then I’m still pretty young so what do I know.
No question
I started taking medication when I was diagnosed in my late 20’s
I’m now mid 30’s and my only regret is not starting sooner
"Definitely worth it, but don’t be afraid to advocate for yourself as you try the right medication and dosage"
Not everyone is the same
I started with adderall first and now I’ve found Ritalin works best for me after many years
It can take some time to feel like you “come online” best try not to feel discouraged; but age has nothing to do with it.
I was diagnosed at 46
"Medication gave me the stability to work on some non-Pharma strategies, so now I am less reliant on the meds"
Meds will help - and my response to medication was part of the diagnostic process - but working on non-medicinal techniques and strategies is just as important.
"Mate, if you just found out you need glasses and always have needed them, would you seriously be asking if there's any point starting now? If you keep squinting like that, you'll just get wrinkles and headaches"
Older is 70! 30 is pre-middle-age.
“I didn’t have to yell at my brain to do things like it was a foreign body overriding my operating system” is one of the best descriptions of ADHD I’ve ever heard
I couldn’t think of a better way to describe it.
"Even though I myself am not 30, my mom who also has ADHD started medication later in her life"
"Because of other medications she has alongside it, she doesnt take it too much (its Adderall for some closure), but before she started taking other prescriptions, she said it felt like she could finally do things"
"I think it's worth it, since she told me about how she finally feels like she can do the things shes always wanted to do, but couldn't because of the ADHD"
"

Go for it! It's never too late, and even if you end up feeling like it's not of much use, its better to have tried it and felt it was unneeded, than never getting a prescription that might help you in your daily life"
Good luck op!
"30 years old is not old 🤣
50 is the new 40 with advances in modern medicine!

For instance, I’m 35 and meds work great for me"
I don’t consider myself older EVER
"I could understand the concept of being ‘older’ if you were always hanging out with teenagers or always hanging out with people significantly less than your age group.

You can tell this is an ADHD sub..I took one direction and went a few different ways and I find myself still typing???

What am I doi"
ABSOLUTELY.
100% try it.
I was only diagnosed at 40 years old and started Adderall
"

My life has become so much better."
I’m 33 and ‘older person’ has deeply offended me.
I was diagnosed and medicated at 35 now almost 40
"It has changed my life so much! No longer drink, excelling at work and getting all my affairs in order like retirement etc"
I call it the cheating at life pill
I was diagnosed after 30
I cannot imagine life without meds.
Yes
"43, a few months in and the low level dull roar of background anxiety turns off, and it frees up all that wasted energy to pay attention to what you want to pay attention to"
I had this talk with my physician and I'm so happy she talked me into bothering with a diagnosis and treatment
"I'm not a flaky astronaut anymore, it feels good to not suck at functioning."
I can’t speak to your experience being older and recently diagnosed
I was diagnosed at 7 because my symptoms were severe and my catholic school was having issues with me so I’ve been on meds since I was a child
"BUT what I will say is that I have gone off the meds multiple times for months or even a year, and every time I get back on them things are just better"
"I’m more motivated, I can clean and shower and do all things that we tend to struggle with"
"It isn’t a miracle cure and there are side effects that you should plan for like only taking meds in the morning to not interfere with sleep, or immediate release meds in the afternoon, and plan on having a nutrition shake or something easy to eat when everything tastes like cardboard"
"But other than that, yes, I would make that choice every single time"
"My meds make me a (not fully, but better) productive member of society that isn’t beating myself up over something I cannot control"
It really does help
And you can always give it a try and if it doesn’t work for you then that’s fine!
"I’m diagnosed at 56, you still very young."
TIL I'm old because I'm 31.
Lol so 30 being older
Jfc 😂😂😭
Diagnosed around age 50
Adderall made me feel normal for the first time since I was about 6
"Reduced anxiety, negative thoughts and depression, calmer mind, able to maintain focus better"
Everything was no longer exhausting
Now just some things are 
😉
I started medication at age 36
I’m glad that I developed coping mechanisms for my chaos goblin brain throughout my life… but holy shit medication is HELPFUL
It’s not for everyone… but it’s worth a try! Also you’re really young so pipe down with this “older” nonsense!
"I'm 44 and just finally got a diagnosis/treatment, and it's been the most impactful and important thing I've ever done for my quality of life"
"

It's absolutely worth it"
" I'm not much one for regrets, but I do lament all the time lost to unchecked ADHD and the crippling anxiety."
"First of all, 30 is not old :) 

I was diagnosed/started in late 40s and it absolutely helped"
"Sure, you've probably developed some coping mechanisms, but it sounds like you still have things you would like improvement on"
"Also, I found my coping mechanisms got harder as I aged / had less energy"
"I wish I had started earlier when I was still young, like 30 ;)"
I started at 51
It’s life changing
 Been medicated for 4 months now and it’s been the best 4 months I can ever remember
My friend is 80yo
Recently he got Ritalin
It’s literally the only reason why he is able to speak with me at all!
Get this elderly gentleman a phonograph and a top hat pronto! ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
I was diagnosed in my late 30s
Absolutely 100% medication helped.
"Got diagnoses and started medication at 35, totally worth it"
"Not sure for how long I'll take it but right now it's the best that could have happened to me.

Also, the meds work when you take them and you can stop taking them whenever you want so you lose nothing trying :)"
Absolutely! I  wasn’t diagnosed until 32 but I struggled my entire life up until I started meds
I can finally read an article without feeling anxious the entire time and don’t have 50 projects going at once.
Life changing at the end of a career but the best time to make a change is yesterday and the second best time is now.
I was diagnosed and started medication at 38 (I’m 40 now)
It was 100% worth it for me
My diagnosis and the meds changed my life
I wasn’t sure if I should get diagnosed because „I’ve live with it for so long g what’s the point” and the I realised I’m worth if it will make life even a little easier (thanks to therapy:p)
"Haven’t looked back.

Medication is a very personal decision what majorly helps with stimulants is you can try them, the effect (when you get your does right) are instantaneous(though honestly to feel the full potential if give it a few weeks)"
You can also stop taking them at any time
You can take them not take them it doesn’t matter
"It’s great, it’s not like with many other medications where you have to wait and then if you wanna come of them you need to do so slowly"
"

So form my experience definitely worth a try"
We get used to the way things are and have no idea it could be different
"I’m no longer constantly exhausted, I remember stuff, I have less guilt, less shame, things that were hard are easier… I could go on :) 

If you do decide to take them and they work for you use the honeymoon period to get habits in place"
"Go to therapy (I think you already are) and start a road to being kinder to yourself.

Edit; to apologise for all the typos I don’t have energy to correct right now"
Soweee :)
Yes
Yes it does
Diagnosed in my late 50’s and Vyvanse has been great
I wish I had been diagnosed years ago.
"I'm 27 and started this year.

It's a yes but not only a yes.It's a""WOW!DO PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THIS EVERYDAY??LIKE THEY CAN CHOOSE A TASK AND EVEN IF IT'S NOT A FUN TASK THEY CAN JUST...DO IT?WOOOW!"" kind of yes"
"Diagnosed at 26, currently 37, it was incredibly helpful"
"I didn’t have obvious classroom issues, school was easy enough to figure out, life though? I don’t know what I would do without it"
"Passing a test was easy, being a function adult was virtually impossible without meds"
"That being said, you likely need to work on tools to manage it in addition to meds even if they’re effective"
Tools are great but no tool is a fix.
Ummm yes
I got diagnosed at 45 and started meds asap
I still cant believe this is how life is supposed to be
Absolutely yes
Get the meds!!
I’m much older than you and just started on meds
30 is not old for diagnosis.
I offended by your “older” definition
"To answer, yes - it helps tremendously."
Lmao since when is 30 old?
Hey I'm older than you and started meds at 50
I was diagnosed at 45
Honestly I wish I had my diagnosis at a younger age
"I managed to survive life, have a career etc"
But I worked twice as hard to get what I wanted
"I struggled because I couldn't focus.

You are still young"
Adhd affects all aspects of your life
I finally have answers for why I do the things I do
My meds have really helped me.
I am 65 and I wouldn’t have a life without my medication
 See a psychiatrist as soon as you can get in
It may take time to find the right medication(s)
Be patient and know that you don’t have to live the way you have been.
"lol, you’re not an older person"
You’re very much a young person
Love you
"I'm 30 with inattentive adhd and meds are giving me a new lease on life, I can't believe how much less stressed I am, even that gives a huge executive functioning boost"
Since we're chronically stressed from just trying to push ourselves to do the bare basics every single day
"It's not a miracle and I had to have my miracle bubble burst first hand, but meds are very effective for a lot of us, they're extremely worth trying at any age of late diagnosis."
"Hello OP, I've been diagnosed at 38 years old as inattentive ADHD and started medication with Ritalin at the same age.

It felt like going from swimming in a mud pool to racing with rollerblades in a proper track.

Go get your prescription and start your new journey, you will be amazed by the power hidden in you."
Wow haha I guess I'm ancient! 50 here diagnosed finally at around 47
"Yes, it's worth it 😊"
"Short version?  Yes.

Long version: Fuuuuuuuuuck yes."
< 30 is not an “older person”
" That said, yes, I started meds at 48 and have had some success."
You’ve got your answer
"
The best time to know is 10+ years ago, the second best time is today"
"
50, diagnosed 2 years ago"
"
Undiagnosed ADHD took me places"
"
Diagnosed ADHD stops me going to so many weird and destructive places"
"

Honestly, knowing it has put the breaks on some of my obsessive ‘projects’ but I’m confident that they would have put me into a grave earlier."
"Tf, old?"
"Older? 30? 😆
Try 60"
yes.
"The answer is YES, unequivocally yes"
"It's at least worth a conversation with your care team.

Plenty of other responses, so I'll skip adding my detailed ""Adderall dramatically improved my life and eliminated my recreational drug use + anxiety problems"" story"
"

- 30 year old female, diagnosed at 21"
"I started taking Vyvanse, Adderall, when I was 42"
"  
With the ability to maintain focus, I'm able to enjoy life much more.

Medication is just a small part of the overall managment of your brain"
"

Sleep, nutrition (no sugar diet is a must), exercise (180 to 300 minutes a week) must be balanced to have a meaningful, fulfilling life."
I got diagnosed at 26
Did not start medication until I was close to 29
"I'm now 30.

My journey went like this:

Starting the medication, it was hard to pinpoint any effects"
"After a while, I could tell that something was different, life difficulty was turned down a little"
"Like 9/10.
We kept experimenting with dosage and type, and when we found the one I'm using now, life became 8/10"
"Found the right dosage, and I'm now at a 7/0.

Now, I can say a little more what it helps with, but it still feels like it's not all.
I find that I need less mental energy to stay on a task that's not very exciting.
Regulating myself is a little easier.

Again, it does not feel like it's all"
Just life feels a little easier.
Started medication at age 47
It was worth it.
Yes
 I’ve finally got on Vyvanse five weeks ago
"I am 42

When I was little, I was known for writing great stories"
 I dreamt of growing up and writing a novel one day
" In university, I always did well on my papers. 

Over the years, as responsibly increased and execution function depleted, I lost my creativity.

This past week, I was actually able to pull ideas together for my first novel"
 This was a part of myself I thought I lost
 It really is the most incredible feeling
 I didn’t not except meds to actually improve creativity but here I am
" 

I say give it a try"
 You can always stop and the drugs will be out of your system by the end of the day. 
I (42F) wasn’t diagnosed with Inattentive ADHD until I was 39 or so
Been on meds ever since and it has helped me tremendously
"Worth it, in my opinion, if you find one prescription works well for you."
Diagnosed at 43
 Game changer for my personal and professional life
Treated my underlying anxiety and depression and I have more confidence.
ADHD meds are for everyone
Not just children
It is life changing.
"I started taking meds for ADHD in my 40's, I believe it was"
30's was bipolar
Both group of meds did wonders
"However, you must know that taking meds is only HALF OF THE PROBLEM"
"Through the years, you come up with coping strategies, to compensate for the ADHD"
"Some of those strategies will be good, however many of them will be bad strategies"
You will need new strategies.
I am 28 and was just diagnosed and medicated
It’s worth it
"And if you do start medicine, whatever you do, don’t understate how much it is or isn’t working to your doctor"
Whether that’s it feeling too effective or not effective enough
“Better than before medicine” does not equal as good as it can get.
"Well,,, I feel very old"
I was diagnosed this year at 35 going to 36 back in March
"

Just started taking adderall a few weeks ago as needed"
"

I was also of the same thought"
I have been all along without medicine
Mine is inattentive type
It manifest very different
Like if I lose interest in what I am supposed to be then it’s nearly impossible for me to push through
"

Ironically being busier with a large number of things to do actually helps me do better in all of them but it comes at a significant cost to sleep and health"
"

I think the med has helped me stay more focused, I can still have all my things but then I can actually complete them before moving onto the next thing"
"

So maybe it’s working… not sure"
Could also be just the therapy and getting to understand more about adhd
"

I certainly benefited when I am hyper focused and would normally not have the energy to function the next few days but still needed to function."
You 100% should take at least one dose to see how it goes
"As a 36 year old, practically in the grave, yeah you should check them out."
Older person 😂
Diagnosed late and got on meds in my 40’s
Game changer going strong 8 years later!
"Yes, I'm 31 and started 1.5 ago"
It changed my life.
I am 44 and just started medication in June
"I have an ok career, and a family that I continue to grow for and become the best version of myself but also for me"
"We should never stop growing, and if that means starting a new medication then so be it."
I'm 43 and just started on medication this month for after being diagnosed last month
It's been eye opening and quite helpful.
My husband was diagnosed at 42
"It’s been a life changer, honestly."
42 year old guy here and just started vyvanse
"It’s been worth it for me, even if the feelings are unexpectedly complicated."
"As someone who was diagnosed and started medication in my late 40s, lmao at your “older person.”

Hells yes to meds though"
Everything from making phone calls to driving to budgeting to playing games without driving my friends nuts is easier now.
I wasn’t diagnosed until I was 57
It’s so worth it!
"53 year-old here, diagnosed at 49"
Meds are absolutely worth it! The negatives of adjusting are far outweighed by the positive life changes brought about by treatment.
"> “older person”

> “soon to be 30”

Bruh 💀 you are young"
I pictured at least 70+
I started meds at about age 41
Still at it
"At the very least, *try* stimulants, you will know very quickly if they are helpful and they’re out of your system quickly as well"
👍
In my 50s
It’s only worth it if you want to lead a happier more productive life
"Otherwise, nah."
I started at 58
No regrets
Would be a wreck without it tbh.
I’m 41 and while none of my family approve the of my meds (3mths in) I justify it to say my brain isn’t developing anymore
I did all the important things I wanted to do
Now all I want is a high quality of life
I’ve lived a hard life
I just want to do the things that make my life happy now.
"How dare you say 30 is ""older""

*cries in 30s*

Adderall has changed my life for the better"
"I know that it isn't for everyone and other meds work better for other people, but I truly would not be able to function without my meds"
I was diagnosed and medicated at 28
It's never too late!
LOL! Older person?!?! I'm 54 and it still works for me
" However I learned that if you have high blood pressure they likely won't prescribe stimulants, so keep yourself healthy"
" And saying you're older reminds me of younger guys referencing something ""back in the day"" and meaning 5 years ago.."
back in the day is like 50 plus years ago
OK rant over LOL
1
You’re not an older person
"Yes the meds may make a difference.
2"
Someone described my ADHD as internally hyperactive
I think clinically it’s “inattentive” which makes no sense because my ADHD is ALL the attention in ALL the things ALL the time
Inattentive is such an ableist term because it implies I’m not focusing on things the way other people think I should
My brain is hyperactive but my body doesn’t demonstrate this.
"""Older person"" 

Yeah, it's life changing if you are blessed enough to have a doctor, insurance etc"
"I've yet to see a downside to at least giving it a try.

36 M btw, been medicated for 3 years"
It can be lifechanging.
You're 29 and you consider yourself an older person? Seems like you answered your own question
Yes get on the right medication
I was diagnosed at 32 haven't looked back
Went from being a space cadet to making 6 figures within 6 months of being medicated
I was 29 when I was diagnosed and went on meds
 It changed my life
 My depression and anxiety were symptoms of the ADHD
" I was shocked at how ""slow"" a normal brain functions and without a million thoughts all at once"
 I'm 44 now and went off meds three times for pregnancies over the years
 That is when you realize how much it helps
" I started to think the meds didn't do anything, but during those breaks I quickly realized how much they helped my quality of life"
 Try the medicine and if you don't think it is worth it then you can stop
" Sometimes you have to try a few before you get the right ones, and sometimes (like me) the first day you're on it you cry because you realize how different your life could have been had you been properly diagnosed and medicated earlier."
"Yes, I thought you were gonna say you were 58"
"At 30 YES, go get on meds"
It will help you in your career
Oh and the correct term is ‘inattentive’
You have inattentive ADD.
"Late 20s and yes, its a game changer"
"I cant imagine my life unmedicated now, im 38"
Be prepared for a learning curve to get the best meds for you
Vyvance seems to be the best cause less hardcore withdrawls as it wears off
I have short acting adderall and the down slope is not great.
"Not my personal experience, but my mom and I both have inattentive type ADHD"
My mom grew up with parents that didn’t believe that ADHD was a real disorder and that she was just lazy and didn’t care about her grades
"Once she was in her mid-late 20’s, she was diagnosed with ADHD and started taking medication"
She said she wished she had someone advocate for her when she was younger and was constantly struggling with school
She has been medicated since she was diagnosed and it was definitely life changing for her
"It made her realize that when her ADHD is actually being treated, she can accomplish and complete work/everyday tasks with the same ease as a normal person"
"She has always said how her diagnosis greatly changed things for her, even though it was diagnosed later than most."
"My gosh, yes, it’s worth it"
I was diagnosed at 42 years old
My MD prescribed Ritalin
Ritalin allowed me to go from a C- lawyer (or worse) to at least a B+ lawyer
For the first in my life I could sit down for 3 to 4 hours and concentrate
"I could research and write a competent legal brief, prepare a witness examination for deposition or trial, really read my adversaries’s papers"
And I continued taking Ritalin for the next 24 years of my law practice until retirement
"

I still take medication and successfully manage real estate investments, sit on a non-profit board at times"
"Post-retirement, I enjoy sitting down and researching and writing"
I could never do so unmedicated
"

In grade school and high school I cruised along on native intelligence and the ability to score well on standardized tests"
"I could not fake it in college, law school and studying for the Bar Exam"
"Unmedicated, I was so distractible, I could not sit down and study or write for more than 10 minutes"
I had to get into such a state of terror at a looming exam in order to study and I barely squeaked by
"Had I been diagnosed early, I could have thrived (and enjoyed) college and law school"
"

There’s lots in your future"
Make your next 50 years the best!
"38 here, back on meds since i stopped when i turned 18"
It's been life-changing
"I've become a better husband, father, and caregiver"
Absolutely go for it.
I'm a human man born in a long forgotten time
"The records say the year was 1986, but who can say for sure when such a chasm of eons separate past from present? I started meds like 3 months ago"
It's been great.
"Yes, also you're not old lol."
"Hell, I'm 77 and recently diagnosed with ADHD and about to start meds"
I'm looking forward to seeing how it goes.
30 isn't old
" If you have reasonably severe ADHD, it's almost certainly having some impact on your career, and ADHD meds are worth it"
" Arguably more worth it.

The other really big thing, the meds help me to be a better father"
 I can get more house chores done and participate in my kids life more actively.
I started my meds at 53 and I am so glad I did
It's never too late.
"my meds help me with so much more than focusing, they help me with my executive functioning so much like I can do my laundry when i say i’m gonna do my laundry"
They also help my mood not be all over the place and i don’t get irritated/mad/upset as easily
I feel like My mood doesn’t go from one extreme to another (which i felt like happened a lot before my meds)
"

i also noticed i could fall asleep easier when i started my meds (not rlly that much now bc im used to them but like when i started them and finding the right dosage)"
"

to me my meds are worth staying on for more than just being able to focus or read"
They help me in so many other ways so I think you should try them and if you decide they don’t make much of a difference then you can always decide to not go on them.
You're not old
I'm 27 and just started taking it
It's a life changer
I really enjoy it to be honest
IDK it's weird
"I keep telling people, I can clean my room? Like I couldn't do that before"
Everyone thinks I'm insane
"

I'd take it slow"
Don't try and take it every day
Breathe through it
Don't feel pressure
If you're anything like me you suddenly really enjoy cleaning lol.
Umm… yes
Made me functional for once
I’ve been off of concerta for 3 years now while I have our children as I didn’t feel comfortable being on any medication while pregnant
"My life is much much harder, my depression is back, my executive functioning is a disaster and I can’t keep up with anything"
I’m looking forward to going back on it once my second is born.
Diagnosed at 39
Trust me
The meds are worth it (she says although she’s been doomscrolling Reddit for 30 mins)
"I mean, I started quite a bit before 30 (23), but it was definitely worth it"
"And at 52, I still take it every day"
"The biggest difference I see between myself (diagnosed and medicated late) and my kids (diagnosed and medicated as kids) is that I have a lot more coping skills than they do…so if I have to go without meds (because they aren’t always available when I need a refill), I can manage"
It’s harder and I don’t like it…but I can do it.
You’re still quite young! Enjoy it! I’ll be 52 in less than 2 weeks and started meds for the first time a few months ago
It’s SO WORTH IT!! I wish I would have been diagnosed and started meds sooner.
I am in my 30s and I take my meds daily
"
I spent the majority of my life without being diagnosed and without meds"
I thought I was totally fine
"I was not fine lol

Once I started my meds I realized how much easier everything could be"
"My most noticeable changes with meds, is I have far more emotional regulation skills"
"Things feel less overwhelming, I get less angry or frustrated, and when I started meds I realized that everyday I have brain fog, that I didn’t notice UNTIL I had meds and realized it felt better 

It’s never too late to prioritize your mental health or well being"
Damn I’m 30 settle down now with the older person
R u out of ur mind?! Brother u are not old
Ur in ur prime
Get those meds.
31 yr old here
For me it is totally worth it because I went back to college (long story) but I have really bad difficulty concentrating if it’s a boring subject or if I don’t understand the subject so NEED meds or else I’ll fail my classes
But it’s also extremely helpful for me at work too because I noticed I would also get distracted sometimes at work and since being on meds again (was on them in my 20’s but stopped taking them bc I didn’t like the particular one I was on at the time) I noticed it’s been helping me with my focus a lot
I say if you feel like you need them definitely try them out and there’s so many different ones too so if you don’t like how one of them makes you feel you can always try another.
34 (F) here! I was diagnosed late and started adhd medicine when i was maybe 31
It seriously changed my life
"I wish I had gotten diagnosed sooner! I have had a great experience, and the medication has helped me a lot (especially with my eating habits and impulsivity, plus I get so much more done)"
"Obviously, medication isn't for everyone, but if you and your doctor think it could help, then I'd go for it!

Also, if you try it: Don't be discouraged if it doesn't work right away! Depending on the medication, it could take a bit for your body to adjust"
"Plus, some medication works better for somw than others"
"Personally, Vyvanse has worked wonders for me (and my brother and mom), but concerta made me feel like my symptoms worsened while I was taking it"
However! I had a co-worker who used concerta and it worked great for her!
"Yes!! Like- did you know that you actually are trying twice as hard as everyone else to pull off barely acceptable work?! That is why you go into vegetable mode, your flippen exhausted"
Meds can help.
Started at 31
"I like my mind calm, emotions regulated and able to actually focus"
"Started meds at 30, definitely beneficial if it impacts you in any way day to day."
"I’m 33, just got back on it last month and can say it’s 100% worth it."
Yes
100%
Yes.
Yes! I’m in my forties and it has helped me quite a bit.
YES
diagnosed at 35- highly recommend giving it a go if you're diagnosed
 It's changed my life
I don’t think there’s an age limit to start
But it depends on how much your condition affects you.
YES
"

(Also, you are not an older person).

It will change your life"
It allowed me to actually start achieving my goals and stop feeling like life was happening TO me.
"I am 37 and I started a new medication, Concerta, last week"
" I went 3 years off medication, and before that I was on Adderall for 15 years"
" 

You are not too old."
Just started Adderall at 41
Worth it.
YES.
You could live another 50 plus years so YES
 I’m 43 diagnosed 2 months ago - the medication has changed my personal and working like for the better
It’s a massively positive change
"I can follow a recipe, read long texts and understand and remember them, switch effectively between tasks and back again, anxiety and mental paralysis gone"
I just can’t explain enough how amazing it is!
"Diagnosed at 40ish, feel like a new man"
Definitely do it
"

It's not a cure-all that will last forever, mind"
I'm struggling somewhat in not feeling as good as I did at first
I need to work out why the meds aren't working as well
But give it a go
It'll be worth it.
"The answer is an emphatic yes, it is definitely worth it"
"

But don't take our word for it"
You can start the meds and stop them if you don't see any value
It's not like you're getting surgery or something
"

You just get a prescription and take a pill"
"The pills work immediately, like within minutes"
Take them for a few days or weeks and see if they make a difference (they will).
Hell yes!  I was diagnosed in my late 40s and started Vyvanse and it was a game changer
Both in my working life and my personal life
PS why is this being downvoted? I think people are downvoting things because of the shortage of meds
Do it
Thank us later
I personally like many got off of ot at 18 but after getting back on it I love it
Things are quieteramd it's been so nice to be able to just plan and do things without thinking about it.
I just got diagnosed ADD at 30 years old and put on adderall
It’s been a game changer.
"Oh God Yes!! I thought my Dr was joking when he told me I had adhd, I took the meds bc I trusted him"
"It took me like 3 months to say, Oh! Yeah, hrs not joking! Meds are a big help for me"
It may take a bit of trial and error to find one that's right for you
"I am 48, diagnosed in college"
"I took meds for a few years, then quit for several years in order to have a couple of children"
"Didn’t start up again until my early 30’s, then quit again and started back up in my 40’s"
I’ve seen value in taking meds in every stage of my life
"FTR, the times that I was unmedicated were largely due to several state-to-state moves, switching jobs and insurance, issues finding providers etc"
"

I see no harm in trying meds"
"They enter the system quickly and leave the system quickly, so if they aren’t for you, no harm done"
"If you are reading for pleasure and ADHD interferes with that, why not try meds? The medical establishment tends to overemphasize medication for professional purposes, but personal endeavors are no less important"
"My family and hobbies deserve my attention as much as, and I’d argue more than, my professional life."
"YES!!!  This isn’t something that goes away or is “cured”, and your mental health is just as important when you’re 20 as when you’re 60"
" Unless you’re a sadist who enjoys getting by on coping mechanisms which sometimes work.

It’s never too late to be your best self!  And if medication can help with that, by all means, take it!"
I just started at 39 and it is luge changing.
"I’m 41 take meds everyday , have for 5 years / life changing - I can hold down a job and take care of my kiddo im a great wife - I was a piece of work before"
Absolutely! Diagnosed on my 50th birthday! Everyone is different and your path is yours alone
There are certainly a lot of folks who chose to not medicate for all sorts of reasons
"
At 30, your life so just beginning!"
I have inattentive type and was diagnosed last year
My life and well being is so much better after medication
Go for it!
I started medication at age 39
No plan on stopping them.
It's definitely worth trying! I'm 42 and have been taking meds for about 12 years
I recently found out I have high blood pressure and am trying to get that sorted out
I hope family history doesn't make it so I have to give up meds
We'll see.
I'm 38 and have been on medication for a little over a year now
I'm glad I started finally.
Started at 41..life changing
I’m 31 and I started about 2 months ago and yes it makes a difference
I’m someone who doesn’t like to medicate if I can avoid it so I spent a good chunk of my 20’s building better/healthier behavioral habits for work/life
But it still wasn’t enough for me
"I sought support, got an official diagnosis with a psychologist specializing in ADHD and I got medication"
It’s funny finally understanding how much energy/motivation I get from the meds BUT it’s not a cure all it’s just another tool
"You still have to have directed intention when it comes to executing a task, but it makes it a hell of a lot easier"
I was diagnosed with ADHD and started Vyvanze when I was 33
I was just about to start an mba program
I graduated with a 3.6 and multiple awards after spending months before the program started believing I’d fail out
Getting that diagnosis and medication was life changing
"In short - yes, it was (and is) worth with"
"Fuck yea, you've just learned to cope my friend"
Unlock your brain.
Following
I'm 34 and started concerta last week
Same diagnosis as you
It's an adjustment but totally worth it imo.
My mom was wondering about going on medication for the first time
She is 65 years old
"My argument was that she could live another 20 years or more, and if she could improve her quality of life then she should at least try it.

I'm 33 and I started my meds at 27"
"We aren't even middle aged, and have many decades ahead of us as long as nothing unexpected happens"
Go for it to at least try meds and live the rest of your life.
"This is obviously anecdotal but I’m in my mid-thirties and was diagnosed about a year ago, also inattentive type"
Meds have been an absolute game-changer for me
I used to struggle a lot with task paralysis; the medication isn’t a magic bullet but it has helped dramatically
"I really wish I’d sought out treatment much, much earlier"
Of course your mileage may vary but I think it’s at least worth a shot.
"Brother, I thought you gonna say 70"
"Yes it’s worth it, just be completely aware, it’s a process"
"You  need to communicate results with doctor, adjust doses or change meds"
I'm M 36
"Was diagnosed at 30.
Ritalin significantly improved my short term memory and levelled off my mood swings"
YMMV.
"If you struggle, yes"
"If not, no."
Got diagnosed this year in my 40s
Tried meds and it really obviously helped me even in the first week
I think it's worth seriously considering and at least trying to see if you think the improvement is worth it.
I'm over 45
Just started
It helps
I can actually deal with my life
"I was coping until COVID and then went off the rails, unable to focus, etc."
I'm 66 years old and take Vyvanse
It's a life changer.
A older person? I thought you were in your 70s.
I was 45 when I was finally diagnosed and treated
(Behavioral therapy and meds) Yes it’s worth it!!! Treatment changed my life
I’m able to maintain and balance life so much better
"I still have issues, but not nearly as many as I once did"
"And when things come undone for me, it doesn’t seem as hopeless as it once did"
"

And I’ve learned via therapy what mechanisms work for me"
"Daily to-do lists, a calendar, pacing myself, and routines"
"I don’t enjoy these mechanisms, but I enjoy life more because of them"
"

You’re in your 30’s"
You have so much life in front of you
Make the most out of it
"

🕊️"
I'm 46
"For me, it is definitely worth it"
"I try not to take meds on my days off, though"
It gives me a chance to practice/build good habits that help combat adhd without risking my job.
Diagnosed last year at 42
Medication has literally been life changing
"
Just know it can take some time to find the right medication and dosage for you."
I think it generally depends
"But for me, yes absolutely."
"I started at 33 with elvance and it was life changing, like I had on hard mode my whole life and I just put the difficulty settings down."
"Diagnosed after college and starting my career, life is easier"
Worth it for me.
Dude
I’m 47 and just started again after stopping in my early 30s you aren’t old
You don’t out grow adhd and in some people it actually gets worse with age… like myself
"Took my first Adderall at 30, and ended up crying for all those years lost because of all the adults who failed me."
Yes I was diagnosed in my 30’s and I have no regrets
"This was basically me, and it was life changing for work and getting stuff done personally"
"

So I would say yes 👍"
My moms in her late 40s and got on meds and said it’s a positive life changer for her
I started my meds at 24 and it helped me alot in most ways
Yes
Very much worth it.
34 and just started meds for the last 3 months
I’m still finding my dose but it’s been a game changer for me so far! Only issue is my blood pressure but hopefully can get that sorted
Go for it
"Diagnosed in mid 40's, then medicated"
" It changed my life, all for the better"
 It's been well over a decade that I've benefitted from effective drug therapy
 I can't imagine going back into the fog.
"40yo white male, diagnosed this year, started on 20mg Vyvanse then upped to 40mg"
It makes a huge difference.
Started Adderall 2 months before my 30th birthday
"I immediately noticed an immense positive difference, but over time, I noticed it made me angry"
"I talked to my provider and switched to Dexadrine at the start of 2024, and that has been way better for me"
"There are tons of ways to treat ADHD, and everyone has their own reasons for what they pursue"
"I like my meds and they work for me, and it's that simple for me"
"   
  
Over this year, I've grown to love my meds more for the way it helps me emotionally regulate, the focus feels like a bonus honestly."
I'm 49 and on Adderall
I went for a long long time without any medication
"First Ritalin, then Cylert, the stopped in high-school 20 or 25 years ago"
Now I'm on meds again and my wife says she can tell the difference
Sometimes I notice a difference when I forget or run out.
I’ll be 27 soon and it’s definitely worth it but also we are not older people lol
If you were in your 70s and retired I’d say maybe not if you don’t want to but otherwise yes it’s definitely worth trying.
An older person? Haha
Diagnosed and medicated at 36
Life improved dramatically
“Older person” 😂🤣😂
As long as your blood pressure is under control and your heart is healthy
"

Any doctor that says stuff like “you *must* be diagnosed as a child!” or “you may have had it but you’ve grown out of it” should have to put on clown clothes and give their nose a little honk while they say it"
This shit is lifelong and gets worse with the natural cognitive decline of aging
You have to develop lots of positive coping skills and unlearn lots of negative behaviors that arise from dealing with symptoms unmedicated
Therapists can help with this alongside medication if you choose it
"

Be your own advocate"
Research things
Say no to meds you’re uncomfortable with
It’s all risk vs benefit
"I was medicated for 10 years successfully, then went 18 years without it, and now I’m trying them again"
But trying meds is a long process of starting low and raising a dose slowly over months… then saying “I don’t like this one” and starting over again with something new until one feels right for you
Or you can get genetic testing to see what you metabolize best
"Also make sure you go for a neuropsychology evaluation for a solid diagnosis that can show you your strengths and weaknesses and also evaluate you for other disorders at the same time.

If you are in the US you are likely to be jerked around unless you wait for a psychiatrist and get referred to a neuropsychologist for testing"
Without a paper trail leading to a solid diagnosis you may find your prescribing physician/PA retiring or leaving the practice someday and the replacement denying you treatment
They make the process a pain on purpose
The biggest issue is the medical merry-go-round and difficulty in accessing the meds with the longterm shortage
"

I finally went off my meds after decades of successful use (as an adult) because of this nonsense"
"Caffeine and nicotine is all I’m using; they suck, but better than begging for drugs monthly."
Started it at 26
Best thing I ever did
I can focus and do tasks I never thought possible.
I’m 31 and was diagnosed this year and FUCK YES they are worth it
I cannot put into words how life changing this is
I didn’t know I had adhd cause I wasn’t the hyperactive stereotype Bart Simpson we all knew growing up
I only suspected adhd a couple years ago and finally got the confirmation and RX and I feel like the best version of me that I never knew existed
Being in therapy helps cause while being so happy with this life change I kinda am almost mourning my last 30 years cause I was kinda unknowingly living my life on hard mode and don’t know how it could have been different having medication and therapy at a young age
If they prescribe you something try it and find that right dosage and meds its worth it.
"I started at 29 and every day am grateful I finally got a diagnosis and started getting the medicine I needed.

Plus, 30 isn't that old"
I've read a few anecdotes from people who didn't get diagnosed and medicated until their 50s.
"Diagnosed in my 30's, meds were a game changer, symptoms became manageable."
I'm 50 and take 70mg vyvanse
 I can't function without it.
I was not diagnosed until I was 45
"

My 30s were a huge struggle"
"I was actively trying to improve myself and my life, and failing"
"Once I got medicated, EVERYTHING got better"
 It also enabled me to forgive myself for the entire lifetime of being a failure  - it is NOT something I did on purpose
"

I strongly suggest you get the help that can help you"
Life can be far better than just barely making it.
"I got diagnosed, and started medication at age 37"
"It was night and day difference, for the better!"
I'm 44 and I'm not old yet!
I’ve accepted at 29 it’s a thing and am working to get an official diagnosis right now
I have been on Wellbutrin for about 6 months and it’s helped me stay calmer and less stressed
I’m excited to take the next step!
"Yes, life changing for many of us"
"Dang, I just turned 38 and I still mentally feel like a teenager lol"
"In all seriousness, I was just diagnosed a few months ago at 37"
"I'll be honest, it hasn't enhanced my life exponentially, but I may require some adjustment to my meds"
"I would say, give it a try"
It may drastically change your life.
52 and nowhere near old
Yes definitely worth it!! Helps so much at work.
Got diagnosed in my 40s and now get to spend my remaining years wondering what my life might have been like if I had been better able to focus
"Not that my life is bad but so many missed opportunities because I flaked out when it came time to act.

Yeah, it’s worth getting meds."
I am 42 just diagnosed and starting on meds
Why not? Better now then after I am gone
I am 5 years older than you and started medication this year
"It's definitely helpful, even though I'm working out the right specific treatment still"
"I'm a big believer in therapy before medication in most cases, but I found that ADHD meds were essential for me to be able to implement the skills learned in and out of therapy."
"I was 33 when I started meds, and yeah, it's been more than worth it."
I was diagnosed at 45 (I’m still not an older person 3 years later!) and am doing so much better on meds.
I am 62 and have had bad experiences w Vyvanse
Dm for details.
I started my medication at 37 and I’m glad I did
It was nice to figure out that I wasn’t an utter and complete failure and that there is actually something I needed help with
I was starting to think I was going to be a loser for the rest of my life
"

Make sure you give your medication a chance unless the side effects are really unbearable"
I feel like some people don’t feel it working the first week and they want to try something else
"

I’m on Wellbutrin and atomoxedine and I didn’t feel anything except sleepy but I just kept taking it"
Finally after 5 months I can feel it working
Had I given up after a month or 2 I wouldn’t have had the chance to feel as well as I do.
Absolutely
I was on it during high school and I got off during college/early adult life
"I do wish I never got off it.

I got back on in my early 30s and have been on it since"
I'm not planning on getting off anytime soon
I wish I had never stopped taking it because I would probably be more advanced in my career by now
"Since I've been on it, my career has 10X."
I got diagnosed with 32
I can't think of a more important medication in my life
I was diagnosed at 40
Taking meds is the best thing that’s ever happened to me
Yes it is worth it
It changed my life
My brain is quiet.
Brother I didn’t start taking medication until I was in my early 30’s
It’s never too late to start getting help for things.
Um; yea! I started at 38
Changed my life for the better big time
Jesus… I’m 43… am I dead? Yes it’s worth it
"I'm your age and only started taking medication a month ago, IMO it has helped a lot. "
"Diagnosed and medicated at 43… it’s been LIFE CHANGING! 

Unlike anti anxiety/depressants, you don’t need to be on them for extended periods of time to evaluate their effectiveness"
My family doctor & I tried a few different options before settling on my current type/dose.
Yes  It changed my brother's life because he was able to focus and follow thru on things that seemed impossible for him to do in the past.
I started at 42
Totally worth it
I’m 32 and I find it extremely helpful in day to day life
I work in tech and when things get crazy it’s the difference between being on top of everything and being completely overwhelmed
And I’m only on a low dosage
I started in my late 20’s.
"I started stims when I was 38, it was life changing."
I was diagnosed at 39
"My body isn’t hyper, my mind is"
"

It takes me ~10-15 minutes of reading before i can focus enough to understand what im ready"
By then ive read only 5 pages and have no idea what they are
"

I’ve been on 30mg vyvanse for a couple of weeks and have been able to read more in those 2 weeks than a normal 2 months"
"

I haven’t been able to organize my garage for years, did most of it in a day"
"

The first week was a bit honeymoon and now that I’m settled in some of the productivity has waned as well"
"

However, my mind no longer races, i can read more easily and I’m less overwhelmed by organizational tasks."
"Goodness, is thirty considered “older” these days?! 😀 Well, for what it’s worth, the am a late-diagnosed 59 year old on Ritalin and finding it very life-  enhancing."
I was interested until I got to the part where this “older” man is younger than my youngest child.
"I was diagnosed at 33 and meds changed my life.

lol older person, you young bro"
100% without a doubt
28 and recently diagnosed
I was very hesitant to get on medication and once I did it has since thoroughly changed my life
"I can go on and on about the reasons why, but it's different for everyone"
"For me, it's been a complete gamechanger and I will never look back"
Always worth a try
"Im 29, just started meds - and it has been a LIFE altering experience - in the best way."
Yes
Diagnosed early 30's
It's crazy how much less energy I use to do the same things.
I started at 36
lol 30 as older is funny to me
I’m 37 and have been properly medicated for 1.5 years after wrong meds for 2 years and it’s changed my life
I started medication at 35
It’s definitely not too late
"soon to be 30 older person? 😩😩😩

yes it works for me an elder of 38 😂 just diagnosed this year lol"
IMO.
"I WISH I would have taken my symptoms seriously enough to get diagnosed and medicated in my 20s, once I realized I could possibly have ADHD"
"I instead decided I was ""managing"" this long anyways just fine (in my warped mind it was just fine) so I didn't even bother"
"Fast forward to the past 12 months, I'm late 30s and it took major life interruptions (one being losing the most rewarding and best job I've ever had over tardiness) for me to realize it was NOT manageable, that it had actually gotten progressively worse over the years and I ignored it over it and over"
"Had I acted sooner I would have saved myself so much turmoil, shame and embarrassment"
"
I think losing my Dad the beginning of 2024 really exacerbated my symptoms, then a new pregnancy started in August and I spiraled"
"I would definitely recommend taking action while you still feel you have at least some control, because you never know how things will be down the road."
37 years old here
Diagnosed 2 years ago
It has been a big help.
Absolutely
"This is not just my experience, but also many, many other folks I know"
Look up the driving with adhd statistics
The risks don’t go away as you get older.
Enormously worth it
Pain in the ass but improved my quality of life to an absurd degree
"I was diagnosed at 34 and started on vyvanse that same day.

First day i took it, it was like the pearly gates of heaven opened when my brain went so silent it felt hard to even have a conscious thought because I'm so used to the noise inside it's like my brain was in shock"
"

Then I started to remember where my wallet was, my house got clean, my wife and I started having long heartfelt talks again and I was happy to be around other people and felt more in tune with my body and mind than ever before"
"So yea, it's fucking 100% worth it"
I started taking dextroamphetamine when I was 50 for ADHD
Diagnosed when I was 7
"My job performance reviews went from piss poor (with comments like ""I do not know what he does all day"") to exceeds expectations after starting stimulant medication."
Dude I'm 46 and would desperately love to discover some kind of medication that works for me
None do
Take advantage of the tools you can.
Diagnosed and started at 45
Absolutely worth it
Watch your blood pressure and don’t mix with too many other substances adults tend to over indulge in
But yes absolutely worth it.
Inattentive type
Started ADHD meds at that age
It literally turned my life around
"

I used to fuck literally everything up"
I couldn’t pass basic math let alone college algebra when I was younger
"I went from that to placing into calculus, becoming an A student, and getting a bachelors in computer science"
"

I went from bouncing from dead end job to dead end job to becoming a software developer with a stable happy life"
"

What do you have to lose by trying meds?"
"In Taiwan, adults who are diagnosed with ADHD only have Ritalin as an option and cannot use other medications"
"However, it doesn’t work for me, and if I take more of it, I feel very sad and even experience depression."
lol “older person”
You’ve got to be joking.
lol older? I just got diagnosed at 38! DO IT! I was you 9 years ago… stubborn! 😂🥰I’m kidding… but only a little
Just try it
I feel like a completely new person and it’s amazing to have a name and a treatment for something that i struggled silently with for so long
"Over the course of 6 years, I got diagnosed and medicated for 5 different things that weren’t what I had and I was struggling"
"After getting a second opinion, I got diagnosed correctly and put on the correct medication for me and it’s A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE!!"
I wasn't diagnosed until I was 32
"It took YEARS to get the right meds, but it makes such a significant difference for me.

Work, housework, hobbies, conversations with friends in noisy restaurants, reading, etc"
All improved by the ability to focus and function at my best.
"I started meds at 29 and hooooooo boy! I spent a lot of years calling myself lazy, but once I was on the right combo of meds, I got really mad and asked my husband if things were always this easy for him"
I was legitimately so mad that I'd had to fight through the simplest tasks for so long thinking it was normal and everyone had to force themselves to shower or clean or do literally anything that doesn't interest them in the moment
"

Spoiler alert: no, ~~η𝐄ＵⓇ𝐎ⓣ𝕪𝕡ᶤςＡㄥ~~ (god, i forgot about this sr's supid automod rules) do not have to think about the 30 steps it takes from start to finish to take a shower and they don't have to talk themselves into getting dressed, and they don't have to force themselves to eat because it feels like the biggest chore of the day.

I'm not saying that meds will for sure help you, but something like 70-80% of people with ADHD see benefits from ADHD medications with or without additional interventions.

If you're worried about the availability of medications or starting on a controlled substance, you can try out non-stimulant medications first"
"I really like Atomoxetine, personally, but it made my brain tingly"
Vyvanse was an absolute no for me because it swung my depression into overdrive
"It likely isn't going to be something that just works right away, no matter what medication you start with, but persistence is definitely key for finding the medication that works for you"
"It took 2 years for my doctors to find a combo that works well for me.

Ultimately, it's 100% up to you, but don't deny yourself medical intervention because of your age."
"Currently 39.....was diagnosed at 38, I am very happy I started Adderall"
It has completely changed my life
Totally worth it
I thought I had been doing well without it but after being on it for a while now I can see how much it has benefited my life
I have gone back to school and I am about to start a new better paying job
You can always stop medication if you don't like.......so why not try?
Im 30 and its so worth it
I’m 36 and I stayed taking adderall when I was like 30
It’s a total game changer for me
I was able to go back to school at 33 and eventually become a licensed embalmer/ funeral director
"It helps so much with my daily work, the focus and clarity"
It lifted the brain fog.
"That is not old lol! But I get what you mean, a lot of focus goes around young people and kids"
"


I started at 28 and definitely helped me a lot"
"Focus better at work, enjoy my free time more cos I feel more present"
I started medication at 33 and it completely changed my life
I can actually do the things i need to do now
"I'm 32, and it was the best decision I have ever made"
I'll never go without as long as I possibly can.
"I feel like a grandma! 33F, didn't get diagnosed/medicated until 31"
"I agree with the other folks who say yay to checking out meds- the only thing I want to add (and I hope you see this OP since I haven't seen it mentioned but maybe it's just lost in the comments) is I did notice you mention you're a dude.

Now, I had boyfriend who was medicated for ADHD when we were in college.Due to how stimulants impact blood flow and prioritize blood flow to the brain and not really anywhere else, we had to get creative sometimes when we wanted to be intimate, if you catch my drift"
"Just something to be mindful of to discuss with your doctor- and maybe meds have changed in ways where that type of side effect isn't a thing anymore, just wanted to mention it lol."
"I recently went on meds in my mid 40s.  I wrote about it on my blog: 


https://distractedfortune.com/take-your-meds/"
"Absofuckinglutely.

Journay PM has changed my life completely for the better.

I had negative experiences with Welbuterine and Atomoxatine and an okay time with Venlafaxine...

With everything available now I'd say for sure but if your going to try you do need to be willing to take your time with the med to make sure its right for you.

 Doc's shouldn't be starting you off on high doses, finding the roght dose takes adjustment and time"
Cheers!
Ummm….I’m 57 and was officially diagnosed a year ago (pretty sure I’ve had it all my life) and meds have been a game changer/ it’s not like your life is over with
"You still have lots to do in this lifetime, you might as well be productive and feel good about yourself."
I’m 31
I was diagnosed as a kid and was medicated for a very short time at that time but haven’t been since
I JUST got medicated again this month
Absolutely not too old
I have 2 small kids to manage which was the biggest driver to get medicated again.
I am going to be 50 and i am struggling in life
"Today i was wondering the same thing, thank you OP for posting"
I wanted to make a post but forgot about it
"

I am almost 100% sure that i have ADD"
"I found out a year ago that i might have ADD, it hit me as a surprise"
"

What would be the first steps to be diagnosed and get medication?  Also from what i understand some medications work differently"
 What would be good to start with to try out?
Just started taking it in my 40s ...
It messes with your appetite but works as expected
I only started ADHD meds at 28 and they were life changing
34m and it’s the reason I found out I have BPD and adhd
"

It gave me the capacity to process without brain noise and excessive attachment social personality"
"

I no longer lie to people to gain favor"
I don’t lie to save peace
"

I’m finally getting to the person I want to be (BPD thing) after feelings empty for so long"
Arya gingival for their personality and perspectives to copy and mask
"

Now I have spun the ga or of so many people that a lot of these people hold me high regard"
I care about very few of them
"

Reason is that don’t know me"
They the character I’ve spun and score out to gain favor
"

Now I see the dissociation clear as day"
I’ve been abandoned by my dad dying on me at 10
Having to help and parent my mom to gain favor in her good moods as she is BPD and Adhd type as well
"

I see how I’ve been robbed of my childhood and I’m not over it"
It hurts me really bad but I cry in silence because I never understood
"

The very people I want to be seen from dint see me at all, they see my character"
Mask lol that’s trivializing what I did to myself
"

My character gets reciprocation I don’t"
I hate it
"I always feel empty and feeling empathy and socializing, inclusion with others gives me good happy feelings which I amount to happiness"
"

Medicine killed the mask, I am Josh, and I’m building a new me everyday"
"In not my disorders, they are apart of ME."
I just got on Wellbutrin to help with adhd brainfog at 33 and it has helped me immensely!
YES!!!!!! I’m 37
Vyvanse is life
LIFE!!!
I started medication at 36 and it essentially saved my life
"Yes, I’m in my late 50’s!"
"I wasn't diagnosed until I was 28, getting medicated was the 3rd best decision of my life behind buying my house and marrying my wife"
Do it
It's life changing.
"I got diagnosed in my early 30’s, and subsequently medicated"
"I don’t know if you’ve ever seen Howl’s Moving Castle, but it basically felt like the mental equivalent of that ooze was just… sloughing off"
36 years old
Started medication a few months ago
Life changing in all the best ways.
Yeah when you find one that works for you
Wouldn’t consider 30 old.
I just started taking medicine and it’s been a game changer for me
I just turned 40.
"I’ve started Concerta in September, I’m 29 female"
It was one of the best decisions for me
"I’ve discovered many things about me and my struggles in my working and everyday life were not about me, but the symptoms"
"It’s not crazy energy and concentration though, (because I also have bipolar and take antipsychotics), but it reset me to function hysterically as a normal person with his normal ups and downs in productivity and concetration"
Better memory and less clutter in a home too
"

If you have this opportunity, take it"
"Because in my home country it’s not available and considered a drug (narcotic that is), so I’m happy I can use it now, it’s a privilege for many people"
"So go agead, wish you best health."
I think it’s worth it if your inattention is dangerous for your safety or if you don’t live it well/if it’s making your life difficult.
I got off them as they make me feel sketchy in the jaw
Oh it helps
Haha.
"I turn 29 tomorrow, and started ADHD meds about a month ago"
" Strattera wasn't for me, made me completely emotionless, had 0 motivation, and caused other weird scary side effects"
"

Started taking 5MG Adderall Instant Release yesterday for the first time ever, twice a day, and holy crap, I wish I got diagnosed MUCH sooner!  My parents never bothered to get me diagnosed but suspected something was up growing up, they're also against medications in general for mental health"
" I moved out last year, and have been focusing on my mental health ever since"
" 

What I felt yesterday, is something I've never felt my entire life, this is what I've been chasing to feel with drinking / smoking in the past but never reached it"
" I feel calm, have far less constant thoughts in my head, can focus on 1 thought at a time, and things just aren't bothering me as much"
 I also have more energy and have more motivation
" I had a moment yesterday where I was like, ""Is this what it feels like to feel normal?"""
" Having less noise in my head is what I've always wanted, and people would never understand when I would describe the noise in my head constantly."
I didn't start until I was in my late 20s
"Would definitely recommend it, it's never too late to improve your life"
"Even if you can't do a stimulant (I can't because of heart issues), there are more non-stimulant options coming down the pipeline every year it feels like."
Diagnosed mid 40s
Adderral
Worth it.
I'm 52 and just recently got officially diagnosed and got myself of generic Adderall
Yes it makes w huge difference
I used to self medicate with way too much caffeine
Don't do that.
You’re not old …
Started at 33 and definitely worth it
Took it at 37
"Changed my life, saved my marriage"
Do not hesitate.
Adderall changed my life at 35
Diagnosed at 50
60 now
I wish I knew that my problems were not just laziness when I was younger
  I know that with meds I would have been a much better Mom
"  Sad, but true"
I was 32 when I was diagnosed and have only been on meds for about a year and a half now ( I'm now 35)
I went back to school in my late 20s and I struggled so bad with my bachelor's degree
"I had a really hard time concentrating and was not comprehending what I was reading, much less keeping focused"
I started meds and it has been an absolute game changer for me
"I'm doing so much better with my job, I got both my bachelor's degree and a dual certification in medical billing and coding and accounting/bookkeeping"
I've landed the job of my dreams and just hit my 1 year mark
I attribute it all to being diagnosed and medicated
I'm in a good spot in life  because of my meds
"There's still a ton of things I'm working on, but it's getting much better and I'm an entirely different person than I was even 2 years ago."
Oh also to add that you should not wait
I knew in my early 30s but waited
I really regret that because a lot of unnecessarily bad shit happened that could've been avoided.
I’ve been taking dextroamphetamine/salts for 27+ years now
"The sooner you can get it figured out, and as long as you’re healthy and it isn’t detrimental to your health, it can literally only help."
"I have my diagnosis at 35, I’m not old!"
I started mid forties and I don't regret it one bit
I use medication almost every day and it helps me
Good luck with your journey.
I’m 43 just started my meds a few months ago and I can see the difference between before I started and after I started.
57 here — diagnosed 8 years ago
"Yes, it’s absolutely worth it."
"56-year-old dude here, diagnosed and started Adderall at 55"
"It’s been a totally life-changing, I feel like I’m now the person I always should have been"
"I wish I’d been diagnosed at your age, even much earlier, life could’ve been very different for me"
You’ve been fighting all this time with one hand tied behind your back in world decidedly not designed for your (our) condition
"With the clarity and awareness meds provide, you’ll recognize how much you’ve been struggling without even knowing it"
"I hope you find a medication that works for you, don’t wait, at least give it an honest try"
"Trust me, you don’t want to grieve and feel angry about all the things you’ve missed out on in life like I have with my late diagnosis."
Yes
Helpful to gain some clarity and understanding
I was diagnosed this year and started taking medication
"It’s life changing, and I wish I had done it sooner"
I’m 54.
I just started adhd medication last week
Please consider it if your doctor recommends and approves it
It absolutely is a game changer
Dialing in my dosage still but I immediately felt a massively positive impact
"Bro an older person is 60+, you're 29 lol"
"Listen as long as you're in a healthy state, go for it."
44 yrs old and have been on meds for a year and a half
100% worth it!
I’m 46 and just started meds
Still working on the correct dosage.
Dude
I'm a 45 year old woman who started medication in March
Yes it's worth it
Yes I can focus and have less impulsive slip ups at work now
"And most of all, I can come home from work and not have tons of rage that my family had to tiptoe around"
"It took me like 2 years to have the strength to bring it up with my Dr, and that finally happened this spring"
I say go for it.
Older!? At 30?? no babe you're fine
"I think if you 65 and had a really bad heart I would say no stimulants, but I think 30 is still very young"
These days people generally understand it's not just a childhood disorder.
I got medicated at 25 and I was so angry because I feel like I could’ve done so much more with my life had I gotten medicated earlier instead of literally suffering without knowing I was suffering.
Everyone is different
Try and see
 I found for me I kept developing a tolerance to the dose and it didn’t feel effective
It also made it really hard to sleep and eat with such a high dose.
It's worth trying.
Its not getting any easier brother
Start working on solutions now because life will get more demanding as will your desire to examine yourself and address what isn't working
"If medication can clear some chaos and make space for calm, medicate away."
Has adhd been ruining your life? Then yes.
I started Strattera in my 30s
Absolutely worth it
I have to take stool softeners daily though.
"I started taking Vyvanse at 32, adult ADHD"
Changed my life significantly for the better.
Yes
I was diagnosed and began medication treatment at 47
 Take XR Adderall almost daily
 Part of the reason I have better relationships with friends & family today is because of medication
 IMO it is defiantly something to consider.
Hmm
"At 47 years old, I would say hell yes"
I need mine.
"There’s a whole bunch of women like me who didn’t get diagnosed until our 40s or later and, speaking for myself, medicine has been a welcome gamechanger"
It’s never too late to make a positive change for your well-being.
Why wouldn’t it be worth it? Seriously age doesn’t turn you into a dried dog turd on the lawn
Ffs.
Its indivual choice for each person
I look at it from if you have other phyiscal and mental conditions
Its judgement physcharist and yourself should make.
🤣 almost 30 😂
My dude
I started medication at 46.Youre fine.
In the process of an assessment
34
Zero interest in taking medication
Not because of my age being too 'old' but feeling young enough to spend some time figuring out how to manage and understand adhd.
"Do you want to suffer and struggle with the same things you’ve struggled with the last 30 years? Coping skills can only get you so far, it starts to take a toll on your soul"
Go for it man
  Live life to the fullest.
I was first diagnosed at 27 and began Adderall xr 20mg that year
"From the very first dose, it was the quietest the inside of my head had ever been"
It was life-changing.
older!?
"Started meds near 40.

I have partners that started them in their early 50s and one in their late 30s"
"

Do it"
"Uh, that’s the age I started"
“Older person”… WTAF
"I was just diagnosed last April, 58"
30 older you are hilarious
Of course get on meds
 Why wouldn’t you do something that helps you?
"Older man here, I think it’s a great tool to have.
You don’t have to use it everyday, and it wont cure you permanently"
"Also, it vanishes quite fast from your organism, so if you don’t like it just don’t take it again.
I always have some, and use it probably 3 or 4 times a week, the lowest dose of regular Ritalin, so it lasts around 4 hours"
(I believe we can’t say the dose here)
"I prefer not to take it when I understand I can manage my tasks without it.
After some time using it I kinda got good deciding when to take it, and it’s been a great.
One dose before an important meeting makes me so sharp"
Or one dose in the breakfast before an intense designing session makes me reeeally productive
"

I gotta confess I have also taken it before some BJJ tournaments tho 🙈"
I am 44 now and started it about a year ago
 Absolutely a game changer for me
" Does it completely solve all of my problems?  No, but man does it make a lot of them quite a bit better"
" Also, did you at 29 just call yourself an ""older person?""  FFS"
Never too late for Adderall 🤩
It has been for me
Diagnosed at 34 and started meds a few years later.
"just try it, im mid 30s and just restarted"
Yes
" I wasn’t officially diagnosed until I was 55, and it’s been a game changer."
"I have a few friends who got diagnosed in their 30s, and meds helped"
"At a certain age, the responsibilities stack up, and suddenly you can’t manage like you could"
Or maybe you realize you weren’t that good at managing in the first place
"

IMO there’s no downside to trying and seeing if you like it"
"If you don’t, just stop taking it."
"""Older person"" ""About to 30""

Huh?"
Diagnosed a few months ago at 38 and now on stimulant
I never could have fathomed how wonderful life could be and how much easier it is
"I asked my doctor “do normal people feel this way every day? Like…they just start tasks without beating themselves for weeks and months” and she laughed and said yes, sweetie"
I’ll refill your script
It’s been life changing for the wonderful.
"*Laughs in 47*

Yes."
"First of all, you not “older”, you are barely into middle age"
"Most people can expect to live at least to 70, so if that’s you then you’ve still got at least half of your life to go"
"

Second, you’ve run the first half of this race with weights on your legs"
"You just didn’t know it, so you thought it was normal"
"Someone pointed out that they were there, and now you are wondering if you should bother to take them off"
It doesn’t seem like you have much to lose by doing so.
I was diagnosed with ADHD back in elementary school and I was prescribed Ritalin and didn’t really do anything tbh
This year I was prescribed vyvanse chewables at 30mg at first then increased it to 40mg and been on it since
My ADHD was also causing sleep issues as well (mostly sleeping during the day) but the vyvanse helped it
I’m 28 btw
Try it
I was 46
Treatment changed my life.
I started at 32
 Changed my life
 My boss immediately noticed and I remember telling her I felt like I had been swimming upstream with one hand tied behind my back my entire life and didn’t even know it
 I didn’t know everything wasn’t supposed to be that hard.
Now 45 years old
and been taking it a couple years
Yes it did help mr
Adderall did but it had a side effect I didn’t like
Vyvanse is what helped me most.
Hell ya! I got prescribed at 27 (35 now)
"I had been self medicating with caffeine for years, but got to the age where I wouldn’t be able to sleep at night if I had too much caffeine, so it saved me"
I’m definitely way better at my job now because of it.
I didn’t start until my mid 20s but it has changed my life to be medicated
"I am able to adhere to schedules and complete necessary but tedious tasks such as holding down a job, learning new skills, retaining information and preemptively setting appointments and activities rather than always being surprised by them"
"It can be an intense transition, sometimes the medication makes you feel like crap and if you don’t get regular sleep and eat consistent meals and drink water you will feel the personality and mood shifts"
At first you will mellow out or get hyperfocused and excited easily but those effects chill out after a while
It’s not so much that I’m interested in focusing so much as I can now focus on whatever I decide to.
Just turned 33
"Started 30 mg of Vyvanse and my life has been changed

You're good"
"I'm 51, diagnosed and medicated since age 35"
Life changing
"Helped my work, social life"
Best decision I ever made.
Absolutely yes
It's life changing.
I was dxed at 49
I’m upping to 40mg of my Adderall XR
I’m a therapist
Running a solo practice
The clinical time in sessions is easy to focus
But it’s all the other stuff
The less “fun” or fulfilling stuff
It makes sense to medicate
" 

And if you’re not happy with the results in a few days or a week, you can stop"
It’s got a really short half life.
"Of course, it's worth it"
"Do you want your life to improve, or do you not?"
I was diagnosed when I was 33
"Medication can be life changing, but you have to find one that works for you"
"

I found that Vyvanse was the best option for me"
"It isn’t just a rush of drugs into your system like most, if not all, other ADHD meds"
Vyvanse allows your body to naturally produce the chemicals instead of synthetic versions
"It is a much smoother delivery mechanism that doesn’t feel like getting hit like a freight train.

I had tried some others like adderall and well…"
there is nothing like verbally rampaging at your in-laws for 30 minutes in the car at the holidays
That shit turned me into a monster and I’m glad that I was only on it for 2 weeks.
"ADHD gets worse with age, there's no bad time to start taking it."
I started on adderal it was a life saver
I cried
I started to realize friends that were taking it took a lot more
They took it for other reasons
 I think I followed a bit until I realized I didn’t like who I was using so much!? So I started to use less
Less is More
I then got on stratera
The anxiety went away
No jitters
Just calm…
Focus
Wow
I’m so happy now
Every now and then I have my adderal for studying or something that requires deeper focus but you don’t need the hard drugs
Yes it helps us.
Turned 40 in June and it’s made a big difference
 I spent the last 10+ years of my career being a high performer on paper and always struggling with small mistakes that have a big impact
" 

Since starting on meds in June, I’ve been able to resolve the mistakes because I can actually focus now and taking the extra steps to make sure something is complete and accurate doesn’t feel like an exhausting/monumental task anymore.


Definitely spent a week or two mourning how things could be different once I started meds"
 My wife tells me she has noticed positive changes too and knowing I have adhd makes certain behaviors easier to deal with.
"When you said older I debated opening this as a 44 yr old cause I was like I’m not gonna be old enough to answer this, op wth you aren’t old..

Dude I was not even diagnosed until 39"
Yes!! Went on meds at 37 and it was life changing
Highly recommend 🫶🏻
"I am 30 and I was diagnosed 16, but went off medication after university, so kinda similar but different"
I am also the inattentive type! Going back on my medication about two years ago was a life changer
I have found it helps me with so much that I didn’t even realize was a problem
"

Also, there are different medications for ADHD and if you don’t have success with the first one, please don’t be discouraged!"
Lol older
Bruh not you calling yourself an older person at 30
Meds for sure will help
I got diagnosed at 28 and medicated at 29.
37 here
Can't function without meds.
Meds at 30 were life-changing for me.
Dude
"I have two words "" fuck yes"" 
I'm 34, got prescribed at 28"
"It was life changing, and still is.

Do it, trust me - random Reddit guy"
Yes
" Diagnosed at 38, now a few years in, absolutely worth it"
 Has made a huge difference in my quality of life
" 

(Also when you are in your 40s youre gonna look back and be like 'wow I can't believe I called myself older when I was 29')"
ADHD uncs and ogs check in!
yes
diagnosed & started meds age 48
Diagnosed at 31
Medication has changed my life
"Day to day is still pretty normal, but it was profound to just be able to ""get on with it"" without having to struggle"
"My first day, I just did my work on my to do list, wrapped up on time with a plan for the next day, went to the gym, made dinner and went to bed"
"I was like, oh"
There was no psyching myself up or delaying until the 11th hour to get the adrenaline dump
I just was able to do stuff
"

Since then, Ivr been working on building even more scaffolding and habits in my life, so I can use medication less because my systems and structure is already in place.

Tldr - It's not too late"
Medicine worked great for me
"Might not be the same for you, but I would hate for anyone to feel like it's not worth trying because there is a reason we're prescribed it"
Because it really does help a lot of people have a significantly better quality of life
I got a diagnosis and started medication right around my 40th birthday
"I would have loved an additional 10 years of ""how it's supposed to be"" and have 10 fewer years to move what I could have been"
"Yes, it's worth it."
I started at 43 and it’s been incredibly life changing
"Had to figure out which med, but Vyvanse is awesome for me."
Me too! 39 year OLD LADY here
Just got diagnosed in the last 1-2 years
"Started meds, then got pregnant with my last baby"
"Back on meds now, and I feel like I could have gone so much further in life, if I found out/started meds sooner"
"
With that said- I think you should try and see how it works for you"
"
You may find that it’s helpful, and you may not."
"Genuinely thought he was going to say he was 75 LOL 

29 is literally only a third of the way into your lifespan and you barely even had control of the first 10-18"
Lol same - figured it had to be some late-diagnosis person in their 50s
I'm 52 and it changed my life for the better.
I’m 29 and recently got diagnosed
Wonder if I’m eligible for senior discounts on my meds?
Yeah people have to stop referring to 30 yr olds as older
Life's long my dude.
"Definitely thought the same! I was officially diagnosed at 52, and medication has been very helpful."
"Yeah , that was my first thought"
Then I saw 30 and thought so young
"lol I was diagnosised at 55 yrs old,Im 60 now  and have taken meds since"
Its been good.
Same
I almost fell over
I thought it was going to be a post from someone my mums age and then I realise they’re younger than me 😭 I was diagnosed at 34
Lmao same 🤣 then I saw he's a full decade younger than I was when I started and I felt decrepit
Older person? Jesus OP as a newly 40 person that’s as insulting as the term “elder millennial” to me 😂 Seriously though I didn’t get on meds until last year and they were a game changer for me
I’m not allowed to be on them at the moment since I was recently institutionalized in a psych ward for suicidal impulses and I feel so scattered without them that I’m looking forward to getting out of my partial hospitalization classes so I can focus again with the meds.
"44 over here! 🙋🏻‍♀️

Started Strattera a few months ago"
"For me it’s like this: yes, I COULD go hiking for a few miles in flip flops"
"But it would be uncomfortable, then painful, then I’m down until my feet heal"
"And why go through that, over and over again, when I have a really nice pair of trail running Altras, sitting in my closet? 

Medication makes presence and mindfulness more available to me, and slows the endless oppressive cyclone of thoughts speeding through my head"
"Most importantly, it makes me a better mother to my daughter, who experiences me as more silly, more lighthearted, more present, less forgetful, less stressed, less snappy"
"

As if all that wasn’t enough… I read somewhere that recent studies suggest that folks with untreated ADHD have a greater risk of developing dementia, like almost 3x higher, as well as increased risk of cognitive decline"
No thanks!
Me too lol I'm 36 and it has changed my life for the better
Plus doesn't ADHD get worse with age? Never too late to get help and change your life for the better right
"Same! Anything working-age I would say is definitely worth it, or if you’re retired and doing a lot of activities you need to stay sharp for, definitely worth it"
"If you’re just relaxing, I wouldn’t especially because it might hurt your heart"
"lol same!!! 
Omg"
"I’m 37, use it everyday (newly diagnosed over a year ago) and it’s been a game changer"
"I sure hope I’m not an “older person” lol but I am
Middle aged and newer to it and it’s absolutely helpful"
"Also validating, gives me empathy for myself in school!"
"Diagnosis at 45, but 48 now"
"I'm only realizing I'm ""older"" and an ""adult"""
Probably cause my meds.
45 year old lady here! Diagnosed and started meds 3 months ago
Wish I’d had them earlier :(
It doesn’t
My grandfather started taking his at 70yo after being diagnosed.
Same! Thanks for  that kiddo! 😂
Sweet Jesus this is well put.
Exactly meds help me feel normal
I used to struggle to do things every day ppl did with a breeze
I would walk around always tired no matter how much sleep I got
Life was good but hard
"Meds made life good and MUCH more manageable as far as my mood, openness to talk to anyone , and get done what I need to do with ease"
This gives me hope because holy fuck life feels so insurmountable all the time unmedicated and it only gets harder
I’m 37yo and just completely burned out mentally and physically
My parents always say things like “Oh well you accomplished xyz without meds why can’t you keep doing that?” yet are baffled that I had a completely mental and physical breakdown trying to complete a paralegal program after the pandemic
I just physically could not do it anymore like I used to
I was 3 classes short of completing with all As and Bs when I had my firsts seizure and had to put it on hold
It’s 2024 and I still haven’t finished
Totally beat myself up about it and where I’m at in life
This comment made me cry and gave me genuine hope for the first time in as long as I can remember.
What medication are you on if you don’t mind? I’m looking for the right one
What do you take?
What meds?
which meds if you dont mind me asking?
"I’ve been lurking Reddit since 2008, this is the best comment I’ve ever read"
Thank you for helping me describe to my kids what I couldn’t verbalise
"Excellent response.

And I think we'd all like to know which meds had this effect on you? or was it a combination of meds + therapy + training?"
Oof I needed this
I’m not Op but based on descriptions I’m basically in a similar position to OP.
Seconded
I'm 35 and just started
It's a big help
"Everyone's ""right"" medication is different, so don't be discouraged if the first attempt doesn't work for you.

Edit: medication plus other strategies have worked for me"
It's not a magic pill
But adding it to my existing attempts to build good habits has made building those habits feel possible.
"Don’t be a tease, what you landed on?"
35 and started 6 months ago
Changed the entire trajectory of my life for the absolute best!
"Me, too"
"I find that as I get older, other issues like fading eyesight and lower energy reduce my ability to cope"
"I've always had ADHD, but I was previously able to pull all nighters to make a deadline"
"With medication, I can sometimes get started on things when I should and build some momentum.

Also, as I get jobs with increasing levels of responsibility, it's more important for me to act proactively, before things get urgent and the adrenaline kicks in"
That's always been incredibly difficult
It's somewhat easier with medication.
45 here
Same
Good god
Clarity’s back and I didn’t know I missed it
🥲
Yeah OP makes me feel like I'm one foot in the grave in my 40s.
Thank god
I was just diagnosed at 45 and picked up my first prescription ever tonight!
"What an honest, helpful answer"
Thank you
"

I was just diagnosed as an adult, and just started Adderall five days ago"
"The first day was kinda profound: i felt a huge lift, a sense of possibility, and like I had gas in the tank again for the first time in a long time"
"Since then I haven’t felt much, even after increasing my dose"
"I can’t tell if I’m just not noticing the differences, or if there aren’t any"
"

I thought of that when you said the process can be frustrating, and that’s helping me to chill a bit and just see what happens."
"41 years old? You're just a kid! Listen to him, he knows everything! (sorry, couldn't resist the Sopranos vibes)"
What non med techniques work for you?
Not to mention we have double the risk of having accidents.
Thank you for this
"Ng

Pressed send before finishing the word

I’ve done th"
Same age-second or third best for me
"Stand by, will explain"
"

First is marrying a woman (honestly- letting her pick me out, lol) who saw future potential in that baby-man, and apparently has deep reserves of patience that I don’t deserve and can’t really fathom"
I was 20 when we met and… feral
😂 I am *incredibly* lucky here
"

Second was to quit being a low/medium-level alcoholic at 40"
I’ll have 5yrs sober at Christmas
"That second issue, before I resolved it, very very nearly ruined the first, and I now recognize that in some way I was *most likely* self medicating the low level (sometimes not so low level) anxiety that comes along with ADHD"
"

So now here I am- just got a formal diagnosis and medication and … geez"
It’s been a week and I can see the help
"I can’t wait to see what this is like in 6mo, or 2yrs, or 5"
"Similar to “fixing” my alcoholism (which I sincerely do identify as- I’m “in recovery” not “cured”)- I will have regrets over not doing this sooner for the benefit of myself, my wife, my kids"
"First best time to plant a tree is years ago- second best time is now, though."
"I related to every word, I too have inattentive adhd- and as you know, that translates to the 25 tabs open in our brains, thinking of scenarios and feeling two steps ahead only to end up feeling defeated on occasions  
I don’t know if this happens to you, but I feel so hyperaware of everything that it just traps me in my head"
Can you say more about the no sugar thing? Why do you deem it a must?
"I also wanted to add this (it's not medication related, so I made it a different comment)

Another thing that has helped me a lot is understanding ADHD and myself"
"I've done so much research, talked to other people, watched videos, and really saw my own behaviour.
I had many ""Ohhhh, that's why!"" experiences, which helped do tiny adjustments for myself.

I had many more things to mention, but honestly, I deleted the rest.

Just find the things that can make YOUR life easier, and f*** always having to follow social rules"
"If asked, just explain that doing this thing helps you with this and that"
I wish you good luck!!
What dose are you on? I'm in 50mg vyvanse and it doesn't seem to last very long at all and I can sleep no problem on it but that may be a different issue lol
What she said
Newly diagnosed 56 year old and *really* wishing I'd been diagnosed earlier
"Saw someone on an old-folks-with-ADHD thread talk about having to ""mourn the you that could have been."" Ya don't wanna hafta do that"
"Waiting for my meds to get figured out, and it can't come soon enough."
I agree
So many possibilities that could have been...
Lol! I got officially diagnosed at 39
I also feel I could’ve gone further if I knew sooner
I needed meds in college! But I tell myself it’s not too late to get some help/relief now!
Exactly my experience
"Diagnosed at 36, started treatment at 37, and I have since felt like i got a much later start on life than everyone else"
"Treatment has changed my life for the better in countless ways- questioned my marriage and religion, and became pro-choice"
My therapist told me I’d always used “group thinking” before and I’m finally independent and developing my own opinions on things
"

And I feel like I’m controlling my own life rather than just watching it fly by and being surprised by holidays ha"
"I just got diagnosed at 30 and I feel like I’ve wasted my life, I’m still trying to find the medication that works for me"
They’ve started me on non stimulants first so it’s taking a bit
But I’m excited to hopefully be able to accomplish something in this next decade of life.
You kids!!!
"LOL! Right, I was thinking he was in retirement and didn’t have much going on"
He’s got 38 more years till retirement (in the U.S.).
"As a late diagnosis person in my fifties now, is still say get the meds, they help me a bunch"
"Lol, right??! At 40, I guess I’m super late with my retirement…(since I’m still working)."
"I’m happy to hear that, congrats!"
I am 41 and recently diagnosed
An undertaker asked me yesterday if had written my will and written anything about how I want my funeral
He yelled in my ear and spoke very slowly and with simple words.
THIS! We cause ourselves unnecessary stress and miss opportunities because of internalized ageism
I’m 40 and about to start a new career
"There’s life to live, even after our 20’s!"
"Officially diagnosed this year, I’m 54"
Meds changed my life for the better as well.
Lol
"Congrats, I’m glad you are getting the help you need!"
"Lol, same! I was thinking a retired senior citizen with medication sensitivity."
"Lol! 😂 I got my official diagnosis at 39, I get it."
"Wow, good for him!"
Saving this for when people ask me the same question lol
"The big caveat is that YMMV on which meds help and to what degree they help, but the executive dysfunction stuff absolutely is a huge deal"
My professional reputation never really suffered but like every other responsibility in my life stopped getting effort in order for me to funnel that to my work
"With medication i don't magically have some infinite well of focus, but i can perform acceptably at work and still have a good 20% to tactically spend on different parts of my life."
You can do it!!!   Going to school and having a severe ADHD paralysis event is what got me diagnosed
 I finished a 5 year program in 2 and a half years because of the intense focus from undiagnosed ADHD and was just 1 high stakes exam and a portfolio from being licensed as a math teacher
  Went on meds and I still couldn’t pass my tests 😭 But I got my degree after finishing 2 more classes
" In the end the 5 year licensure program ended in 6 years without a license but still, I finished and didn’t realize how amazing that would feel even if I didn’t get what I wanted"
"I got this ‘well, you got this far’ too"
"Like, barely…😂 Like I’m sure I’d SURVIVE a broken ankle if I didn’t have crutches but why the fuck would you do that to yourself, because it’s not ‘taking the easy way out’? 

I also made it through a broken clavicle at like 10 or 11 WITHOUT a crutch because “it’s just sprained he needs to use it as much as possible so it’ll heal"
"No need for an X-ray if it was broken you’d know, he’d be hollering in pain.” While I couldn’t change my own shirt without bawling"
"Guess that was the right call, dr Wagner"
"Even though the X-ray ,3 weeks later when things weren’t getting better, showed it was shattered in 3 places."
"I'm on adderall at the moment, but I'm interested in looking into vyvanse"
I'm staying low dose as long as I can because the idea that over time I may become tolerant of it scares me
"I don't want to build a better life that comes crumbling down because my meds stop working.

But I know medication is just the first step, I need also work on behavior modification and lifestyle changes with it"
"I need to teach myself to be myself, how to form habits, how to manage my time, what lazy really means, how to fix all the things my ADHD required me to have cheat codes for or prevented me from knowing how to do."
Right now I'm on low dose adderall but looking to switch to vyvanse for medication that last all day
"But it's not all medication that helps, it was a lot of learning who I was for the first time, pushing myself to be who I could be now that certain limitations weren't there, learning to build habits and to do repetitive tasks for long periods of time, learning time management skills"
It's a lot of adjusting your cognitive and behavioral self to living a more normal life.
haha Mydayis 12.5mg!
"Us, senior citizens above 40 - we got to stick together"
You never know who's gonna be gone tomorrow
😂
😂😂😂
not OP but work with a psychologist
" There's so many different strategies like CBT, DBT, etc.

The thing is the meds are a stopgap (IMHO) but unless you put in the work on defining those new strategies you'll be perpetually medicated.

Some people may need to be medicated long term"
 I have 2 boys on the spectrum I'm not opposed to the reality of long term medication
 But if you make it to your adult years before diagnosis you clearly have been shown to adapt
" You're an adult so I would think you have the ability to self-assess critically and only address what needs addressing.

ie"
Meds for focus are not going to help with anxiety
" Therapy is critical at getting to the root of the anxiety and how to re-map your brain to see it ""Oh my body is having anxiety again it's not real, ignore it."""
You are good people.  5 years sober myself this year!  
Its a pretty common myth that sugar makes ADHD worse or makes hyperactivity worse
Its BS
46 checking in! Us elders need to stick together.
The grief is real
One year diagnosed
I'm 50
I was recently diagnosed in my 40s and the difference for me after being medicated was shocking
I couldn’t believe that other people just live like this
It definitely made me wonder what things would have been like if things were always this easy for me
Now I’m back in school finishing my college degree so I don’t have to wonder anymore.
38 years of old man here! I witnessed Lincoln’s assassination
It still so astonishing to me that for a lot of people being medicated is night and day
It’s not that much of a difference to me that I could have imagined being a whole other person had I taken meds earlier or hadn’t had periods of being unable to take it due to a shortage.
"Almost 45 here and freshly diagnosed! I didn’t realise I was *older* when I was 30 lol

It’s worth the help at any age"
No matter how old
I’m 42 now and a doctor because I was diagnosed at 29
"I could have been established, stable, and well into my career by now"
"

I’m so thankful that I did get diagnosed and did get treatment that worked but I think all the time about what life would have been like if my parents listened to my pediatrician"
Was diagnosed at 38 but only now at 42 started meds as the first ones I tried in 2019 had horrible side effects.
take Wellbutrin now and life is easier.
">  ""mourn the you that could have been.""

42 here"
"I do feel like that sometimes, but I have to remind myself that there's still all kinds of time to be something."
Exactly
I often wonder what I could have accomplished had I gotten diagnosed earlier in life
"I understand mourning the ‘who you might’ve become’, it’s sad."
Kids these days!
"100% def mourning process now for me, the person who diagnosed me told me they would start me on stimulant medication in January, just need ekg and blood work"
"Idk though, may see a different doc online for now"
"Being diagnosed then tells me come back in two months, strange"
"Idk if it's a test to see if i will go get the meds on my own, or to see if i can complete these tests? Idk, may just pay the extra with this doctor who doesn't accept insurance."
Totally agree
I was in my early 40s when I was diagnosed and mid-40s when I decided to start medication
It's literally the best thing I could have done for myself.
"Same here, and agreed"
I’m glad to hear that meds are helping you even though you found out later on.
"How did you find a routine in your day that allowed meds to really help you, and without impacting your sleep?"
"Same, same! Meds have been a game changer."
Me too
50 here and meds have made a big difference for me
"Seriously, I turned 39 yesterday.."
I want my 401k and my Social Security!!
"I remember feeling like I was too old to try new things in my 20's, like I haven't learnt to fish yet, guess I never will"
Shows how dumb we are when young.
"Honestly though, 40 is the new 30"
"Has anyone else noticed how in the last couple of decades, it seems like perceived age groups have been shifting down substantially? (looks, open-mindedness, etc"
"etc.)

I don't know what to attribute it to, science? People being better informed about how to take care of themselves? The internet? Medicine? Using sunscreen? :P

The average 40 year old in the year 2000 looked and acted like they were 50 I swear, now it's more like 30."
Exactly! I'm 44 and have gone back to school! I've just finished my first semester! It's never too late to better ones life in some way!
"Tell me more, please? 


51, just diagnosed. "
I don’t know if this helps but I’ve been on 10 mg of adderall for 6 years
Before that I think it was 10 mg Ritalin for 8ish years? I haven’t had an increase since I’ve been on it I don’t think.
Thanks Timely Cheesecake
Good to know 👍
The school/medical system is more than willing to let you end up in the gutter if you don't advocate for yourself
" If you had parents who didn't want to believe you had ADHD, you probably don't have a documented diagnosis, and you very well could be failing out of life right now, especially if you got into drugs, which is a way more prominent habit amongst people with ADHD than the regular populous"
" Medicated people with ADHD are less likely to be addicted to other drugs than unmedicated people, and we don't even have good data on undiagnosed people.

Getting to adulthood without a diagnosis is very far from proof that you couldn't VERY much benefit from medication."
"Hmm, I agree that medication alone will not “fix” ADHD and that addressing behavioral issues is key, but strongly disagree on a few points here:

1) That ADHD meds should be seen as a stopgap"
"

My psychiatrist once commented to me that ADHD is under-diagnosed but overmedicated"
I get the sense that that’s what you’re getting at by referring to it as a stopgap
"However, a stopgap is an inherently temporary solution"
"If an individual’s ADHD symptoms are severe enough to necessitate medicating, then medication may not be just a temporary solution for them"
"

An example of the converse: my ex also has ADHD but not so severe that his needs can’t be met through caffeinating, so he never bothered to get prescribed meds"
"In cases like his, meds wouldn’t be considered for treatment, let alone as a stopgap.

And while medication _can_ help address the most severe symptoms of ADHD enough to allow one to work on adjustments and develop new behaviors, that doesn’t mean everyone can or should go off their meds after seeing improvement"
"For example, I have circadian rhythm issues that make it extremely difficult to function in a 24hr-based society"
I actually developed delayed sleep phase disorder in my 20s as a result and no amount of sleep hygiene changes alone could address the issue
"When I was finally diagnosed with ADHD in my 30s, I discovered that the non-stimulant medication I was prescribed eliminated my severe daytime fatigue, which would occur no matter how much I slept, and I also stopped waking up several times a night.

2) That being “permanently medicated” is problematic"
"

Being “perpetually medicated” shouldn’t be presented as a negative thing in and of itself"
It really depends on the individual and what they and their doctor agree is best for their situation
"I experimented with dosage levels with my doctor, and found that a high dose non-stimulant combined with the lowest dosage of a stimulant works best for me.

3) Making it to adulthood before diagnosis means one can adapt 

There are tons of personal accounts in the comments here of adults whose methods of “adapting” to undiagnosed ADHD include alcoholism and/or burnout"
"I’m in camp burnout, myself, and while I also did DBT I never would have gotten to a stable equilibrium without ADHD meds."
It nay be I agree
But personally my brain is far more focussed when eating low carb / sugar.
66 year old here
" *You kids go out to play!!*  Don't come home till the streetlights go on!  

(I was diagnosed a couple of years ago, and was put on Vyvanse"
" Holy smokes, what a difference"
 I too get sad when I think of the pitfalls I might have avoided were I diagnosed and treated as a young man
 Specifically 30 years of self medicating with alcohol to the point of serious alcoholism and the issues that revolve around that.)
Yeah for modern pharmacology!  I am even more saddened when I think about how it could have helped MY elders.)
Lololol 47 here
Ritalin has changed my life
👵🏼
The grief is VERY real
One month diagnosed
I'm 55.
"im still getting told it's anxiety and depression, so i might be an even older lady by the time someone believes me"
"I know there are thousands of responses, but I had to jump into a subthread to vent my frustrations.

Just turned 50"
" Dx by around 2014, after years of treatment for depression, cyclothymia, hypomania, and then varieties of bipolar disorder"
" Doctors finally realized my episodes were somewhat under control, still depressed but steady, and added inattentive ADHD to my comorbidities.

I am medicated but still struggling and trying to decide my next move for treatment"
" I'm tired of struggling at work and at home but I can't seem to get my life ""in order.""  And probably being female close to menopause isn't helping either."
50 here too
Glad I'm still young tho
Diagnosed at 41 and totally agree
"Yes, exactly! 34 and same"
It's been mind blowing and also incredibly validating to feel how people without adhd can just..
do things
But then there's the grief of like..
yea
It really WAS that much harder for me but I was told my whole life I was lazy or making excuses and at some point I kinda started to believe it
The grief of what could have been and not having the support is huge
"But that being said, both my kids are diagnosed autistic and heavily suspected ADHD, so at least I can try to make sure they don't go through the same thing by validating them and helping them develop healthy coping mechanisms to support them until they're ready to start medication! 🥰 that gives me some solace."
Diagnosed at 42 here and nearly two years medicated and it’s night and day
I am able to focus on tasks and actually complete them
"My depression and anxiety have decreased to manageable levels, which I never thought possible"
It has amazed me how I ever got by before without medication.
"What was it like when the crust was still cooling? Were the dinosaurs nice?

(jk I'm 39, and the dinosaurs gossiped too much)"
I vividly remember the first time I took Adderall
"My entire life, language has distracted me"
"If I can hear the syllables in pronunciation, my brain automatically starts processing: can I understand that? What language is it? Do they need help? Do I speak even a few small words in that language? Can I identify what language it's in? Just like that, my focus on anything I was working on is gone"
I had to spend so much conscious effort on bringing my brain back to the task at hand
Cubicles are torture for me because there's no sound buffer
"I have really good hearing so even conversations one room over are distracting to me.

When I took Adderall, it's like someone turned down the volume on all of that"
"I didn't have to constantly remind myself at every noise, ""No! Focus on YOUR work, not that."" I wondered if this is what typical brains are like, being able to sit down and just.."
focus on the task at hand
"I have inattentive type, so it's easily missed and masked."
"For me the meds make a difference in one key area: executive dysfunction.

And it's executive dysfunction that's ruined my life"
"So it's not like I'm a completely different person on meds, but the symptom (which I still struggle not to think of as a character trait -- all those shamings for being 'lazy' really did a number on my psyche) that affected me the most is now a much, much smaller issue."
Same here
"I know the meds are working, because I can’t even stand myself when I’m not on them, but I haven’t found anything that makes me feel like my brain is finally quiet yet"
And the restlessness is still there big time.
"Agreed! I'm 44 and got diagnosed at 43! The meds are very worth while, I wouldn't be back at school without them even tho I didn't find them exactly life"
"Hanging like many on here, they do help"
Op doesn't want to be like I was and mourn what could have been if they were just diagnosed sooner
I still sometiems get depressed about that cos I could have maybe avoided ending up jobless and living in subsidized housing at my age if I had been
I could have had a career I could have been proud of maybe
"Don't do this to your self OP, get those meds!"
"Glad to hear you've had a positive experience, best of luck with it all!"
Nice!
3 years experimentation basically
It took about that long to settle
"

Honestly I still do sometimes struggle with sleep"
I have Valium and Ambien which I use infrequently to solve that and it really seems to work for me
If I take Dex later than 8 and go to bed around 10 I can find it takes longer to drop off
If it's impossible I take an Ambien
I don't drink alcohol so that helps.
Happy belated birthday! 🎈
"These are a few of the ways medication has benefitted me:

It has quieted my head (to a point)"
My intrusive thoughts aren’t as prevalent or dominating
"

My work requires thoughtful, accurate, and sometimes long emails"
I can finish an email before starting another
"Before, I would have 3-4 of these emails on the go because while I’m drafting one, another question would come in so I left what I was doing to tackle the next question"
Or I would simply get bored with it and have to come back to it later
"

Part of my job requires big, but very boring projects"
I do not avoid them as much as I used to and can focus better on completing them
"

My communication skills are better because I am able to better organize my thoughts before I speak"
"

I’m more productive all around"
"

Some people take a medication break on their days off"
"My feeling is, I also want to be productive at home and remain taking my meds 7-days a week."
"> I am even more saddened when I think about how it could have helped MY elders.


Your compassion is a beautiful thing, man, and pretty rare"
:)
65 now
I think the same thing
I knew I had a smarter mind that loved to learn
(Humbly) Instead Ds Fs
Skipped school for pinball pool and frisbee
I couldn't study
"
It's great that I know tho"
I wouldn't want it any other way
Yep..
nobody tells you about that
Diagnosed at 56
Wish I found out at 30! Medication gave me a taste if how much easier life is without adhd
Combined adhd and the roller coaster of grief and relief is intense
52 year old here
Stop complaining
"When I was a kid, THE WHOLE EARTH WAS LAVA."
“Easily missed and masked” excellent description!
"Thanks for that insightful set of comments. 


Tuat would all be very cool. "
45
Reading this sub has really helped me understand and feel better about myself
 It truly is a disability and I learning better to manage it and not beat myself up.
Life could have been so very different..
"But I have a daughter, a home, a job, and interests - would I want to change it? Not really"
But the grief is in not knowing what might have been.
"Yeah, I'm 57, doing adequately and while I'm certain I could have done much better with help from a young age  it hasn't ruined my life thanks to some lucky breaks and lucky career choices.

I'm not seeking a diagnosis now partly to avoid the grief/anger I'm sure I'd feel at my lost potential, but also to leave the meager resources available here to people whose lives it can still affect much more."
Yes
ADHD tax is a very real thing lol
"I bought a dishwasher, never had one b4 lol"
Gamechanger
"I think just understanding you for the first time and being kinder to yourself, knowing that you are different, not broken, not lazy, not crazy.."
thats the most important thing
You dont need an official diagnosis if you understand this already and your life inst crippled without Medication
Working with that..
rather than masking and trying to fight against it can be empowering
Medication saved my life
I was completely nonfunctional in the end and finding out why..
(I had no idea) and then getting Medication has given me another chance ..
round two..
as I learn to navigate each day being me
I don't say this lightly but I would likely not be here if I hadn't finally got this diagnosis and knowledge 2 years ago
So yes grief..
its a process..
not a place..
and it comes and goes..
I try not to fight it..
and then it moves on
But relief of understanding has been life-changing
Take special care ...
I was close to the end before allowing myself to go for help
I spent decades convinced I needed to get better
 I thought I needed to change and I looked for inspiration relentlessly trying to pinpoint exactly what was wrong so I could fix it
The guilt and shame I carried almost killed me
 I love the words you wrote
Thank you
Even medicated it’s hard to stay on point
My mind still checks out and looses direction and momentum
I’m learning to not call myself a fucking idiot
I’m not
I try to stay positive but today is tough
I’ve been doing so well
But today I am sad
I’m glad I have somewhere to share.
 And I thought it was just me as im sure you did....so many years searching for the fix! Take care..
be gentle..
rest that weary brain.

Just got my prescription and have an interview tomorrow

"I can definitely relate! Weirdly enough I don't feel any different when I had a bad night sleep and take medication, but my actions speak for themselves"
"On the days where I mess up lots, get distracted more often or miss details left and right, I always had a bad night sleep or not enough sleep"
We all know sleep is important but I'm perplexed to instantly see the difference between a long and short sleep.
My medication doesnt work when I am sleep deprived
The past week I have consistently gotten 5hrs of sleep
I literally dont feel it :( made a huge mistake at work because of that
This is my experience as well
"Especially if I’ve had alcohol, which I know is terrible for sleep quality, but the negative effects seem to be amplified by the meds."
Hi!! Recently diagnosed combined presentation pre-law student here
"I noticed an uptick in insomnia (I’ve had a weird sleep schedule my whole life, and it’s obviously affecting me more in college) and talked to my doctor about it, she put me on trazodone and it worked like magic"
I’d talk your doctor about that 😊
I've noticed that there's a drastic difference from person to person on any ADHD med
"

Personally, I've never had trouble falling asleep, if anything, I sleep too much"
Even on Adderall
I'm at 30 Mg XR
"I've never crashed at the end of the day, but I don't think I'd notice anyway because I dedicate that time to relaxing"
"

I work a 9-5"
"After 5, I don't need to think about important stuff."
"i have insomnia as it is and adderall certainly doesn’t help, it’s one of the reasons why i had to take such a long break from it"
"just take it as early as you can, vitamin c in the evening can help offset the effects and a lot of people say magnesium supplements help"
You could ask your prescriber to try clonidine at nighttime
It's a blood pressure and hypertension drug that has been approved as an ADHD medication in extended release form for some age groups
"Immediate release tablets are available and have a sedative effect, they can help with sleep when taking a stimulant."
There’s two very important factors to be able to sleep
"First, if you take a stimulant that is extended release you should be taking it by 10am at the latest"
"Second, you need to get up by 9am on weekends even though you may not have classes or work"
"This is so you are tired by a reasonable time, such as 10pm"
"

A consistent sleep schedule took me years to get down with insomnia, but it is so important! I also take anti-anxiety at night and an antihistamine"
"That definitely helps but I am already sleepy by 9pm if I am consistent in climbing into bed, tired or not."
"I assume this IS just about the sleep, not about the meds"
I’m not sure that stimulant meds make things worse or “don’t work” when you don’t get enough sleep: Stimulant meds just can’t erase the fact that you’re sleep deprived or reverse the effects of a bad night’s sleep
"Why would we expect to feel normal on a bad night’s sleep just because we have ADHD meds?

Getting a bad night’s sleep will throw anyone off"
"If you didn’t have ADHD and had a bad night’s sleep, amphetamines would *help* keep you *awake*, but they wouldn’t erase the effects of sleep deprivation"
"
For people with ADHD who take stimulants regularly, I doubt it’s the meds that make us feel crappy after a bad night’s sleep — it’s the lack of sleep itself"
"Compared to not taking meds while sleep deprived, it makes sense that we would perform better with the meds after a bad night’s sleep, just still not as well as when we slept well."
"I had insomnia before I took meds, and after that it could be more difficult to fall asleep at first or when upping the dose"
I take mirtazapine at night to help offset the appetite suppression and sleeplessness
Magnesium glycenate also seems to help with muscle relaxation and relaxing the jaw
"

Honestly I think the residual effects of Adderall that keep my brain relatively quite can be a net positive, especially when I used to stay up too late scrambling to do chores and other stuff I procrastinated with"
"That kind of feverish struggling is the worst thing before bed, which thankfully isn't an issue when medicated."
"Damnnnnn….are you me?? I also only got 4ish hrs last night, felt fine initially then real shitty and off and just weird out of nowhere this afternoon."
Ashwagandha is a traditional herb widely used in Ayurvedic medicine
"Its main active ingredient is withanolides, which are believed to have adaptogen effects, which can help the body cope with stress and contribute to overall health"
"For me, Ashwagandha really helped me sleep a lot"
"I think this can be a worthwhile method to try, but I don’t know if it will have adverse reactions with your ADHD medication"
You can consult your doctor in detail
I hope this can help you.
Diet exercise and sleep make the meds work
Coincidentally all those things help with managing ADHD too
I take vit c at supper to try and get it out of my system
I also don’t take mine on the weekend so I can sleep.
Can you discuss with your doctor about sleeping aids like melatonin?
Eat a big protein breakfast too!
"After starting stimulant medication, my sleep has absolutely tanked"
"Truly has never been worse.

Either I can’t sleep until 2-3AM or I go to bed before 12AM but randomly wake up at 5AM and can’t get back to sleep"
I have been tracking my sleep for almost 10 years and it has never been this bad
"I know all the tricks, sleep hygiene, supplements, etc"
"

I have no idea how to fix this."
"Oh just for context, I’ve had insomnia my whole life both on and off the med"
I know I’m not supposed to every night but I can sleep whenever I want to because I just chew some pediatric melatonin.
"Sleep, protein, exercise"
 Not getting enough of any of those makes your meds not work right.
I learned this the hard way
I wasn’t sleeping much and I was barely eating
I felt like I was losing my mind
Lack of sleep exacerbates ADHD symptoms in general so even without the meds it'll make u feel like shit
I cannnot sleep more than 5 hours anymore
I slept a full 8 last sunday and I felt like the walking dead for 48 hours afterwards
Correct me if i am wrong but didnt Dr Barkley say a ssleep deprived brain is like the brain of a person with ADHD
"I recall hearing something like that.

But yeah if i don't get enough sleep im screwed even on the meds."
Sleep means waking up and fuck that
I think it’s too much meds
I went off my meds for a few months and started back up with my original dose
"I think I had a manic episode, I could not sleep and my thoughts were just racing"
Your body definitely has to get accustomed to it
I try to only take my meds early morning so it wears off at night
Try immediate release meds if you’re on XR
Do you ever eat before bed? I suffered from insomnia with my adderall my whole life and I developed coping mechanisms that actually derail my sleep
Eating before bed is one of them
Prevents rem sleep
You can get less sleep but higher quality sleep by making sure you're not giving into a few traps
Hard for me to get my own thoughts straight right now though.
"Well, if youre taking amphetamines, that's kinda the point."
"Me too, you’re not alone"
Hope you’re doing okay
Trazodone has worked wonders in my life
I sleep like a baby even if I take my afternoon adderall does a little late.
I’ve struggled to fall asleep for as long as I can remember
I tried so many different sleep aids over the years but none really helped long term until my doc prescribed Trazodone in my 30s
It has made such an enormous difference for me as well!
This is kinda my experience too
Vitamin c to help sleep? Sources? I’ve been having trouble with this as well
"thank you for reminding me, my therapist just sent my prescription in yesterday lol"
What is this a vit c for getting it out of the system? Never heard that before
"Oh boy! I forgot/was too busy to take mine this morning- so at somewhere around 8 pm, I took my dose!"
"I’m no sleep expert, but I think your info is wrong"
Pretty sure REM is not what you want to avoid
REM is important to good sleep.
No she has a point
She’s saying that even though you take your meds consistently when you don’t get enough sleep it still ducks you up
"Definitely true, I’ve been struggling with the balance of sleep and meds as well"
i see you are also combined type…i wonder if that has something to do with it?
Do you feel any sort of grogginess or hangover from the trazodone? I have struggled with sleep issues my entire life and have tried multiple medications
I also have ADHD
Haven’t tried trazodone yet though.
"Not to sleep exactly but vitamin C reduces the effects of Adderall and its absorption and metabolises it more quickly.

Something like that"
Sorry I don't recall the technical explanation.
Ashwagandha is a traditional herb widely used in Ayurvedic medicine
"Its main active ingredients are withanolides, which are believed to act as adaptogens, helping the body cope with stress and contributing to overall health"
"For me, Ashwagandha has really helped me sleep a lot, so I think this is a worthwhile method to try."
Vitamin C can make amphetamines bio-unavailable even deep in your intestines
 It doesn't work with methylphenidate.
That's what they said
 Eating close to bed prevents rem..
which is bad so don't do it.
Just another data point here: I was prescribed trazodone for insomnia and it was horrible for me
"I was able to fall asleep, but the grogginess the day after… I couldn’t even get out of bed, because I was so tired"
"Personally, I would have felt better without any sleep"
I haven’t touched it since
I would just talk to your doctor about it and try it out to see how the drug affects you.
I googled it and it looks like it reduces the adsorption rate
Unfortunately this doesn’t help if you’ve had it for a couple hours prior
You just have to take the medication at the right time because taking it later will not help the symptoms
i’ve tried it and didn’t notice much difference but i also probably didn’t take it consistently enough
definitely worth trying for OP though since everyone is different!
Lol thank you
"I’m probably completely wrong, but isn’t it also that it can make your body expel more of it and faster by making your urine(?)/blood(?) more acidic, even if you take the vitamin C at a later time? Or is that just a myth? I’ve never looked for any sources on this."
i’ve heard a lot of people say it helps the effects wear off more quickly as well but i don’t know for sure if that’s 100% scientifically backed or not
but yeah for sure affects the absorption into your bloodstream
maybe people use it for xr?
That’s a good point… I’m not sure!

I was on Adderall extended release 30 MG XR for 15 years
 It became less effective over time
 I just started Concerta
" 

I think Adderall extended release works / feels better"
 I think it's supposed to hit 3 times in one pill 💊
" When you take it, and it releases again twice"
"

But that's just me."
Nurse here
 The only methylphenidate long acting that works is brand name Concerta
" The generics use a flawed method to release the medicine over time and it causes all kinds of trouble.

After my insurance company stopped covering my brand name Concerta, I switched to generic Focalin (dexmethylphenidate)"
 It was a flawless switch for me
 And my pharmacist tells me that it is readily available..
there's no shortage of it.
RN here too
My insurance refused to cover non generic concerta and it was expensive
 Same with Vyvanse

Best solution for quick reminders?

"I'm on day 7 , it's just starting to hit, but it's hitting"
"I started concerta 2 years ago a couple of things could be going on
- you need a different dose
- you just can't feel the difference yet! It takes a couple of days to weeks to actually feel and realise the difference
- you haven't been put in the right environment for it to work yet"

Thank you.

"Fair fair.

I just had a lot of ""Watch for this"" or ""You'll notice a change, right away,"" and I should've girded my loins a little better, got swept up in the miracle drug aspect.

Are you on medication? I didn't get diagnosed until my first semester freshman year of college

Always worth a shot
"The low dose is very typical, it’s to see how you’ll respond to drugs so they don’t give you a big dose and your body freaks out"
"If it doesn’t work, you can try a higher dose.

How long ago did you stop the Zoloft and how much were you taking? Your psych should’ve tapered you off of it before starting adderall."
I’m trying to find the mg but I can’t she told me to up my dose to pill and a half & then up it again to two
And I just couldn’t take the feeling on it anymore
I stopped taking it myself because I couldn’t get up & be 100% present for work
I wanna say I stopped a week ago

“Body doubling” works for me
"I have a coworker who’s ADHD presents similar to mine and we schedule google meetings, we talk for the first 15/20 minutes usually but then we set timers to keep us on track and have “quiet periods” where neither of us says a word for a set amount of time"
"

I’m always more able to focus when other people are around and working too, easiest way to explain it is the presence of other people helps the mechanisms in my brain that produce the important  neurotransmitters for focus"

Thank you this was very sweet

Finch has been working very well for me for about 2 months
They've basically taken all of the addictive qualities of horrible mobile games and use it instead to gamify taking care of yourself and completing tasks
It's honestly genius
"I use the free version, which is very full-functioned, although will probably upgrade to premium at some point just to support the devs."
There are lots of apps you *may* find helpful
I say may because one difficulty many of us with ADHD have is needing constantly new or interesting situations
You may find yourself constantly jumping on the next app that comes across your feed
Beware of any that are claiming guarantees and be sure to verify any scientific claims the apps are making
"Are you looking for comments on any specific apps you’ve seen?

I’ve tried lots but at the moment I use:
—Trello for managing tasks"
I dump anything I think of during the day in one list and then organize that list on a regular basis
"Use the Power-Ups and automations, but start simple! (Switched from Todoist)

—Balance app for meditation"
"They have a bunch of “singles” on ADHD and focus, but honestly just meditating regularly helps me so much! Sometimes I feel like I have to pause my day just for my brain to slow down and re-sync with the universe.

—Calendar reminders to meditate and eat lunch midday help me take a break and reset before aftenroon."
I don't think so
"For me, simple timers work"
"""Hey Siri 30-minute timer"" then it rings and I remember to do the thing"
"Never press ""Done"" unless you are actually doing it already."
I’m a big believer in Notion
I couldn’t ever find an app or system that worked to fit my oddly specific needs to actually work well
"Notion has a weird learning curve to it, but once you get the hang of it (or download free templates) you can adjust and modify a system that is designed specifically to your needs"
"
The biggest thing for me is having all of these tools and systems in a single place"
"You’re more, to do list, grocery list, reminders, and more"
"The options are damn near limitless.
But at the end of the day, none of these apps or organizational methods work if you can’t be consistent with using it"
"Find what works for you, and if you can’t, make something that does."
"Seconding balance, as they have a year long trial!

Currently using Capacities as my note taking app"
"The cloud sync between devices is nice and I like being able to tag notes to find them easy.

Goblin Tools is also very helpful as it'll help break down tasks into smaller steps, among other things."

"I love hobbies that allow for gradual and measurable improvement - or clear indicators of progress.

For me that takes the form of golf (infinitely hard but the progress is incredibly satisfying, and it comes incrementally), cooking (I’m slowly getting to a point where I have more control over the outcome, albeit a bit of a mess) and growing chillies - they’re like my little kids; it’s pure joy seeing them flower and fruit, then turning them into hot sauce/salsa/curries etc "
"+ and as a short term stimulant hit I love the spice - endorphin rush.

A million other hobbies have come and gone (mostly artistic)"
These three persist. 
"This sort of relates to your post and may be an interesting perspective, not sure"
But a while back I wanted to get into art and drawing
"I found a video that was something like ""I learned to draw in 100 hours!"""
"I watched the teaching videos they listed and did the same ""challenge"" myself"
This was an easy entry point for me because everything was already laid out for me
I had a 100h countdown timer as well which kept me somewhat motivated.

I spent the entire school day researching and making a family tree instead of paying attention

"

I definitely recommend writing on paper, writing physically helped my mind stay focused cause moving the pen mist have been fidgety enough (and i can draw in the corner of my paper) 

Good luck!"

I completely understand where you’re coming from because I deal with the same struggles
"I’m not sure if it’s related to ADHD or something else, but I’ve often found myself ending relationships when I feel like the connection isn’t as strong anymore, or when we no longer have common ground, like school, college, or work.

I’m always ready to help others when they need me, but I have a hard time asking for help myself because I feel like I’d be bothering them or that I don’t deserve it"
"I also find it difficult to make relationships deeper, more enjoyable, or less restricted unless the other person takes the lead first.

After 29 years of life, I’ve noticed that people generally like me and enjoy spending time with me, but I still can’t shake this feeling of disconnection, no matter how hard I try"
"It feels like it’s just a part of who I am.

What I’ve learned over time, though, is that I’ve been approaching relationships with some misconceptions"
"For instance, I used to think relationships end when you lose a shared connection, like work or school"
"But I’ve realized that relationships aren’t just about the common ground — they’re about the personal connection you share with someone else.

Another thing I’ve learned is that people don’t always think the same way I do"
"For example, when I think a friendship has ended, it’s usually just me feeling that way"
"For most people, they still consider me a friend"
"And when I distance myself from someone, I often feel like there’s now a barrier between us and that they don’t like me as much"
"But as soon as we start talking again, I realize I was wrong — they miss me, and we can pick up right where we left off.

Most of my friendships have happened because the other person took the first step or because they were introduced to me by mutual friends"
I’ve struggled to make friends on my own because I don’t really know how
But relationships are something you can learn to navigate over time
"It really comes down to loving yourself, understanding that you deserve love and respect, and realizing that you’re valuable to the people around you"
"Shifting your mindset is key, and it’s a process, but it’s one worth working on."
"Yep, I feel you SO MUCH ON THIS 💯💯"

Dexedrine at the right dose should have an identical effect and side effect profile to vyvanse
It’s available in generic as Dextroamphetamine sulfate.
Also try independent pharmacy’s instead of chain stores
My local independent pharmacy takes my insurance and can order whatever I need
They have less clients so they almost always have medication available.
My pharmacist told me that Focalin is not in short supply.
At least some Rite Aid locations will take the GoodRX coupon too
When our CVS was constantly out of ADHD meds a year ago I switched to the rite aid down the street and haven’t had a problem since
"Not a plug for them specifically but you might want to call some other, non-CVS pharmacies"
I am on Vyvanse and it’s way more effective than Adderall was for me so I know I wouldn’t want to make a change like that unless there was no other option.

Seeking guidance -Do people with ADHD not see how they hurt someone/ how do I address it?

I honestly don’t know how to answer without knowing what the breach was
Like I think my answer could be wildly different depending on what they did that was so offensive
I find that malice is generally not the explanation when it comes to impulsivity with adhd.
This is hard
"As a person with ADHD, it’s easy to feel defensive when we make mistakes because so many of us have internal feelings of shame"
"Our brains can follow a track of “I messed up, I mess everything up, all I do is make mistakes…” And yeah, sometimes people are upset with me and I genuinely can’t figure out why"
"

However, I’ve also learned how to cope with those feelings and listen when I’ve hurt someone"
"My main goal in conflict is to always try to reach understanding: what action upset them, how did it make them feel, and even how can I redirect my intentions? Maybe your friend was 

It can be simultaneously true that their disorder influenced their actions AND they hurt you"
"If they aren’t further in managing their symptoms, a productive conversation may be challenging for you both"
"You could start it by saying “I’m bringing up a problem because I care about our relationship and want to understand you,” but if they aren’t super aware of their symptoms or how to cope, it might only help a little"
"

I’d like to also note that if this is something really big to you (it seems so), its okay to not feel like their diagnosis is an excuse or reason"
Its okay to feel that your boundaries were crossed so severely that you can’t forgive them for it.
"No, ADHD does not cause people to act with malice"
"

Yes, ADHD can cause us to miss social cues due to … not paying attention"
"So if you think you are “signaling” something, they may not actually understand it, so it’s probably better to be direct and leave no uncertainty on both sides as to whether your message was heard"
"

I cannot speak for your friend but I care that I miss social cues, as it causes me personal damage in all of my relationships, mostly genuine confusion and mystification due to not understanding why people behaved the way they do, and constantly feeling like I’m “missing” something, constantly being excluded and isolated, constantly having to replay situations over and over in my head to try and guess what I missed or did wrong"
"

What are these negative feelings that you cannot get over and how are they connected?"
"In this situation it’s best to clearly explain what specific hurt you, why it’s hurtful and how you would like to have seen it differently"
And always keep it from your perspective
"Anyone who cares about you regardless of ADHD or not will take the time to listen and understand your point.

Just wanna say, when there’s a conflict between you and a friend it isnt the nicest thing to discuss it with 40 other people"
"Especially when what happened wasn’t intentional, because now you’re making your friend look bad too"
"Those people weren’t there when it happened, they will only have a one sided story which may lack context or could be told differently because of misinterpretations.

Best to just talk to the person themselves, ask for their intentions and explain why it hurt you."
ADHD definitely leeches into my social life
"I often speak before I think, which has been to my social detriment a few times"
"Never anything especially heinous, though"
"Stuff like spilling secrets I didn’t understand were probably supposed to be secrets, yapping about my own personal experiences when someone was venting, over sharing when it probably isn’t appropriate, etc"
"

I would say that it depends on what exactly she did."
"
When I do something wrong to someone, I feel mortified about what I did"
All my empathy circuits are working normally and ADHD has nothing to do with it
But a narcissist or a sociopath might not
"

If they *solely* had ADHD, they may not have thought what they did all the way through and didn't anticipate what kind of a problem it would cause"
Their proper response would be a profuse and genuine apology for the failure to anticipate it
"But if it's explained to them what they did and they *still* refuse to recognize they did anything wrong and don't feel remorse, they're an asshole"
Some people with ADHD might be comorbid with some form of antisocial personality disorder though
A lack of remorse would be a big tipoff for ASPD.
"People with ADHD are usually great at reading social nuances, but can struggle with impulsivity, rejection sensitivity dysphoria and extreme sense of justice"
This could mean something like blurting out your secret because they feel you've been wronged and passionately want to fix it or get justice (in their eyes) for you
This can seem like they're making it all about themselves but that is not their intention
"They will feel it deeply when they've messed up, trust me"
"There's a good Australian podcast episode that touches on this: https://open.spotify.com/episode/7xFZTsLVZuu3iYI1jzMrYV?si=ZfCqIZR7SPSYiRRSc_37Yg&t=4005 (your ADHD besties episode 21)

It's really hard to offer much insight with limited context so I hope this gives you some helpful things to look into to understand the ADHD brain.

Finally it also sounds like they think the matter has been resolved when you cleared the air"
"Again, without knowing what they did I don't want to be dismissive, but think about what it is you need to get out of raising it with them again"
Is there something you didn't get off your chest that is relevant? If you are still processing your feelings/the outcome that might be something you have to do on your own.
"I get the sense you are asking, ""is it really possible for someone to be that stupid, or should I assume this was malicious?"" And the ADHD is just the straw you are grasping at to try and explain how someone could, in fact, be that stupid"
I wouldn't say it's typical for ADHD but it is absolutely possible that your friend was just that dumb.
I think you've encountered a variation on being human that has nothing to do with ADHD
"If anything, we tend to be very good at pattern recognition, and that includes social and behavioral patterns"
"But people in general can be kind and thoughtful, or they can be callous and shitty; they can be worldly and well-informed about social dynamics or they can be sheltered and naive"
"You may have come up against a sheltered and naive person who genuinely didn't anticipate negative fallout from an action they saw as benign, even if everyone else thinks they should have.

In my work I've had to explain things like microaggressions to well-meaning people who genuinely did not understand that they have undermined or otherwise hurt someone they work with"
Sometimes it's not easy to grasp if their life experience is wildly different from the harmed person's
"Something like that could be at play here.

You could approach a conversation by stating first (a) that you really appreciated their apology and believe that it was sincere, and (b) that the incident has really continued to puzzle you, though, because you still don't understand the line of thinking that led to their action in the first place"
"If you're coming from a place of curiosity instead of blame, they're less likely to get defensive--if you start by asserting potential motives like ""purposely hurting people"" or ""just not caring"" it's not going to go well"
"

About that: ""Do they purposely hurt people in order to indulge on their impulsivity?"" Impulsivity in the context of ADHD means that our under-stimulated prefrontal cortex doesn't insert the necessary second or two of pause for decision-making between a thought and an action"
"It leads to us interrupting people a lot, spending time on things that are not priorities (but are more interesting than what we're supposed to be doing), buying too much, and sometimes saying something hurtful that we immediately wish we could take back"
"It's not something we ""indulge,"" it's something we fight and the primary thing that medication helps us with.

Someone who enjoys hurting people is a sadist"
"They may or may not have ADHD, but if they do, it's unrelated to their desire to harm others"
"Similarly, a narcissist is someone who cannot ever admit that they were wrong--they may or may not have ADHD, but the two are not connected"
"That kind of person is not one you'll ever get a sincere apology from.

I hope you're able to have an open and productive conversation with your friend and that you both come out of it understanding each other better"
Peace
No we don’t indulge in impulsivity
We don’t enjoy hurting people
"In fact, you implying that ADHD people might be enjoying hurting others itself is hurtful but I guess this is a social nuance you didn’t pick up on"
"Impulsivity is not like opening the floodgates, it is not deliberate.

There are some of us that work very hard to not use our diagnosis as crutches or even as an explanation"
Please don’t use someone else’s ADHD diagnosis as crutches to move on from an event you already received an apology for
"

I hope my effort to provide a response is proof enough that ADHD people care about others; even those bordering straight out insulting them."
Nope
This isn't an ADHD trait
Being stubborn and impulsive? Big yes
Not being able to apologize and admit you were wrong? 100 percent nope
Some people also try to blame their shitty attitude on mental illness so they don't have to feel bad
"Why? Because it's easier to point the finger than do the work and once you start to accept it, they'll keep doing it"
Eventually it turns into a cycle
I won't lie
"I used to be a shitty person when i was alot younger, but i grew up"
I realized right from wrong and i don't tolerate people who treat me poorly either
"I felt so bad that it took me years to forgive myself, but i apologized to every one of them"
They forgave me since it was so long ago
"You can forgive them, but i would take it with a grain of salt"
Some people are good at lying and coming off as sincere.
Your question is very difficult without even giving some context
"
But I imagine something I call 9/10 for example a friend is cheating on husband and I know telling her husband will cause a nasty fight and they may get into a physical fight… 

I have to control myself a lot, but if I act on Alice or impulsively and tell her husband that she’s cheating, and the consequences are there, I have and will apologize and not get into a fight with my friend"
"

If what happened was bad at the level I explained and the person chose to fight with you, then I guess you’re not looking at adhd as core of the problem but rather something else"
Maybe personality traits or a real other disorder which a trained person can only diagnose
"

ADHD is there for your friend, but it usually doesn’t cause the fight after the impulsivity on an action such as what I described."
"What did they do?
Every ADHDer reading this post is probably like, ""f*ckk.."
"I wonder if this is another social cue that I don't know about.""
We'd love to know, we're always looking to improve our knowledge of social cues."
"ADHD can cause someone to do things that they might not mean to do, but they should always apologize and take accountability"
"It shouldn’t be an excuse, but a leanings lesson."
Hmm never thought of this too deeply but I can be ruthless and cold if I operate without seriously over considering my impact: I thought this meant I was just a bit selfish
"I'd say it's possible they were unaware and unless they've reason to lie, it's hard to conclude deliberate malice."
Without knowing how they hurt you it’s kind of tuff say much
 People can be very hurtful and text book abusive and not think much of it 
Especially if they grew up in what they use as an excuse is a yelling household
 Or whatever 
 I get it I really do 
" 

Getting someone to see themselves and have accountability is tuff business and can split your emotional system into scattered pieces even trying"
" 

I found the only way to get things on a healthy foot is put your foot down hold your boundaries no matter what "
 You really have to be my way or the highway with things and mean it 
 Don’t be mean just make sure you’re willing to lose the relationship if you do not get whatever it is you need
 Let’s be clear there are likely relationships that do not contain whatever it is you have issue with so make that clear 
 It’s not manipulation if you mean it 
 Just a door A and Door B 
 Make them choose and base your direction with that 
"
For me and I’m the one with adhd married 20 years"
I have had to move out of my house and completely give up before I get what I want or need 
 Good communication is key 
 But let’s be real because many times that’s not possible 
 You would think simple conversation and respect is enough to get things done 
 Life is not suppose to be easy 
 And leaning into the hard shit in a hard unpleasant way has got me the most results
 Instead of avoidance 
 Don’t just avoid this stuff even if it can cause fighting
 It will come back to haunt you
 Get it all there and you would like to feel safe in the fact they will not continue with whatever behavior 
 Oh and btw if you fix one thing another will likely come along over and over just rinse and repeat the process 
 This is more of people thing than adhd btw 
 No diagnoses needed 
Just people still learning to grow up and everyone does the best they can with what they know 
 So keep teaching .
I understamd pretty much every social nuance
I think ADHD people see it more
Our brains tend to take in everything
However if your friend is also on the Autism spectrum that might explain it.
"i've dealt with a few of people with adhd saying or doing hurtful things to me because they weren't aware that they were upsetting me, as well as having it myself"
"i do understand what it's like to be friends with people who don't seem to care or notice if they upset you, but i have been on the other side of that too"
"it's like it doesn't always register with me that what i'm doing might be hurtful, but that doesn't exempt you from consequences"
"

for example, i met a person last year who was constantly interrupting me, she never seemed to remember or care if i told her something, and she was an impulsive and reckless driver"
did she mean to make me scared or upset? no
but was i bothered that i got folded into a 2-hour family birthday dinner i wasn't told about on my first night at a stranger's house? yes
was i bothered that she drove some random lady on my state's busiest highway into road rage for no reason? hell yeah
"at some point, adhd is just amplifying bad choices people are already apt to make"
"just like i wouldn't get back in the car with someone willing to be reckless at 80mph, i wouldn't blame you for still being stung for something incredibly insensitive, adhd or not"
"it takes some faith in your relationship to be okay with that person again, and i wouldn't fault you for being bothered that someone would hurt you and not treat it like a big deal"
"

as for how to talk to them, i am not sure"
"everyone operates a little differently and if it's a sore spot, i can see RSD and the time frame making it difficult for it to be a productive conversation, etc."
"It was something that would be foreseeable (at least according to 40 people) that would be hurtful, offensive and insulting"
"I know that they care about me, in other aspects, they have gone above and beyond to be there for me"
That is why I can't make sense that they were so willing to hurt me.
Thank you so much for your perspective..
You gave me a lot to think about.
I support this answer
It really depends on the situation!
"It’s a common symptom for ADHD folks to be terrible at social nuances, not least due to inattentiveness and high impulsivity"
"A lot of the ADHD screeners ask questions around this, such as not being very good at turn taking, struggling with interrupting etc.

There will be folks who are exceptions to this, which can include folks with a history of trauma who are hypervigilant for any signs in others, as well as those who ended up with a special interest around psychology or people watching in order to stop missing social cues"
"

ADHD is also commonly comorbid with autism and autistic traits, where social struggles are also part of the diagnosis."
"Beautiful response - considered, thoughtful and empathic."
“No we don’t indulge in impulsivity.” Are you kidding?? There’s a reason why one of the “types” of ADHD is called “Hyperactive-Impulsive.” Of which I am
"Yes, some of us can be detrimentally impulsive."
I am sorry that it came off that way
I am genuinely just trying to understand them
I did not mean to offend anyone.
"No, ADHDers do struggle socially because of inattentive traits"
It varies person to person
"Personally I’m really in tune socially too, yet when I’m comfortable with someone I’m almost forgetting I’m still with another person and not something to talk at"
I think the most likely answer is that they didn’t know it was hurting you not that they were willing to hurt you in the first place
There’s a difference between being impulsive and indulging in impulsivity
I never said ADHD has nothing to do with impulsivity.
You are right
 I shouldn't have implied everyone is the same
 I detect social clues very well
 My ADHD roommate makes big social mistakes often now that I think about it.

Will I ever be functional?

you can use focusmate to do it in tandem.
with another person who also has adhd.
its like bodydoubling.
Body doubling is actually so smart
I’ve heard the phrase body doubling thrown around a few times but don’t really understand it fully

"I find that my ADHD influences my depression and when I’m struggling to cope with my symptoms, my depression gets worse"
"The more overwhelmed I feel by life and unable to get caught up, the more I feel that numb hopelessness and fatigue where I just want to lay down"
"

Has anything else significant happened recently? Changes in medication, stuff in your family? If you’re in the northern hemisphere the lack of sunlight recently could be contributing too."
I think it's REALLY important to remember that depression is different for everyone
I also recommend you see a therapist or a doctor and talk to them about how you're feeling
"I have a background in psych, and this does sound like you might need someone to just vent to/need help"
"

**My experience:** 

I dissociate HARDCORE"
"A lot of times, I won't even realize I'm depressed until I've been depressed for a few weeks or months"
I have a hard time feeling anything or I feel so low that it's like I can't breathe
I don't want to do anything
I'm snappy
"I find something weird to hyperfixate on, a lot of times it's a TV show or a book or a blog"
"I forget about all responsibilities, because I just don't care"
"I don't eat, or I eat like crap"
I just go through the motions
I stay in bed a lot
I stay in my room
I hide
"I don't connect with anyone except for my ""safe"" people"
"

I hope you feel better, because I know what this is like and it SUCKS"
My best advice is to get help
"Find someone, anyone, to talk to."
Hey OP! I have diagnoses for both and can give a list of symptoms
"I have these symptoms on and off medication.

Lack of interest in previously fun hobbies"
"Frequent task switching, whether via mobile apps or non-digital"
Less energy to maintain friendships
It’s harder to fall asleep and stay asleep
Mentally and physically tired for no reason
"Adrenaline inducing behavior, like drinking, dressing risqué (not normal for me), not telling friends/family where I am going, skip college classes, etc"
"My appetite doesn’t change much other than it gets harder to make food, even microwaveable"
I get irritated easily and sudden rages
Emotional instability without the bipolar kind of mania- a combo of adhd/depression/trauma
"Trying to have excessive control when actively suicidal: like immaculate appearance, actually brushing teeth, dependable, making good grades, etc"
My mind doesn’t shut up
I isolate slowly from friends/family/peers
Sleep too much or too little
"Feel disconnected from reality or other people, not necessarily crying at all"
Constantly busy to avoid the depression hitting or not motivated at all- both dangerous in creating a spiral
My laundry isn’t done until I don’t have clean underwear for two days
I sleep on top of my quilt because I don’t have the energy to change my sheets
Life feels monotonous
When my depression was really severe and before going back on medication I was a total bitch to my family
The anger was not mild like I thought depression anger was symptom wise
I do meaningless stuff like scroll Reddit for 3 hours after classes instead of drinking water or playing vide games.
I recently noticed that my ADHD medication was initially effective for my motviation for tedious tasks
I was fairly productive despite being under stress
"

However, when the stress beaker overflowed and my mood plummeted to the point of meeting the criteria for depression rather than just being low mood, it was like the pendulum swung right back the other way and I had 0 motivation for anything at all, it was way worse than it ever has been with ADHD even without meds"
I could barely motivate myself to get out of bed or do things I enjoy
"I couldn't eat, I lived off  mostly liquids for nearly a month"
"I struggled to make myself shower, change and brush my teeth each day when I usually don't struggle with those.

Every task was completely overwhelming, even the smallest things took a huge effort and my brain fog was so bad that it was like it was crashing like a faulty computer every time I tried to get anything done even things as simple as scanning a sick note in and emailing it to my boss or signing my name on a form, those both felt so overwhelming I couldn't even think how to do them, its like my brain just wouldn't work, I don't know how else to desrcibe it.

I'm only just coming out the other side of it now where I can think a bit more clearly and do a bit more.

I'd say the biggest difference for me between Depression and ADHD is that the lack of motviation and overwhelm with tasks is also there for things I usually enjoy when I'm depressed, whereas with my ADHD it's only for tedious things, especially those which require sustained concentration"
"I also don't get that extreme brain fog or self neglect.

When im not depressed, before starting ADHD medication (I only started this year), I struggled to start tasks like paperwork or cleaning and forgot to take the laundry out etc"
Due to my ADHD
I've also struggled with my emotions and self soothing all my life but it feels very different to how Depression feels to me
"Depression feels more like an emptiness/flatness/ nothingness rather than sadness for me, though I will have crying spells with it too, I'm mostly just very flat, for lack of a better way of putting it."
I have diagnoses for both
"I was able to manage ADHD pretty well in the past, I’d be able to forcefully cut myself off from the world and get work done in cases where I had to, especially under pressure"
During university I had one of the worst depressive episodes in my life and it makes ADHD a whole lot worse
"I was unable to focus on any of my work and would end up sitting in front of the computer for 8 hours and not get anything done at all.

I’m not sure if you’re taking medicine but that’s one of the things that’s helped me; both stimulants and antidepressants"
"I find that regular exercise also helps with that depression, which in turn should improve ADHD as well"
I also find that light has a large influence on my mood and motivation as well (I have like the opposite of seasonal depression where sunlight makes it harder to work haha)
Just try and control the factors that you physically can
I hope things work out well for you.
This time of year my depression gets worse
I'd say the darker days and time change make things much harder but I know it is probably more complex than that.
"While I just got diagnosed with ADHD, I have had both anxiety and depression for at least a decade, and I have only been able to pull out of that recently.

ADHD made them both a lot worse, and it was only after they were treated that my ADHD was exposed."
Omggg I got diagonised with depression and adhd too...
I can't use medication though....
"i had depression diagnosed at the same time as adhd, but i got more depressed later on"
"i was able to study and focus when i had to when i was less depressed, but after i got more down in the dumps, it felt like my adhd was even worse, even though i actually have mild adhd"
itsuuucks
 i cant do anythigngfdgkdfj
"I have been treated for depression since I was in my mid 20s, and I am 54 now"
"I tried going off Prozac several times, but each time I did I would have a depressive episode"
So my doctor said I should continue using it
"I had been mostly good, functional,  though I did have those moments of emptiness and numbness"
"But at a certain point recently I started losing motivation for things, and consulted with a psychiatrist, who switched me to Lexapro"
"The depression has been much better.

But at the time I also talked to her about these manic-like moments I've had mostly through my life"
"It's like I'm searching for adventures and up for anything, usually involving bars and alcohol at first"
"I would also get super excited about something then completely lose interest a few months later.i thought I might be bipolar, but my psychiatrist continued treating me for depression because it was the bigger issue"
I also became aware of it being hard to focus on things and was assessed for ADHD
"Sure enough, as I read more about it, I realized what I thought were manic episodes were co.mon unexplainable moments of excitement that is common with ADHD
 It also explained the fights I was in or nearly in, usually because I felt an injustice had occurred and I needed to correct it"
I am lucky to still be alive given some of the situations I have put myself in
"Plus, I had horrible road rage, which is getting better with therapy.

I hope this helps and sounds familiar"
"Medication and therapy, plus more self-awareness have been extremely helpful."
"Have you accounted for or tried to figure out the emotional effects of receiving your adhd diagnosis? 

While some people might feel relieved or validated, it can also bring up a lot of feelings - resentment, anger, hopelessness.."
all sorts of things mixed together really.
This is so helpful
  Making me feel normal
Insomnia
Extreme pessimism
Hopelessness
Crying all the time
Easily overwhelmed
Depersonalisation (like I was watching myself from above)
Fatigue
It felt like I had a dark filter over my eyes where the world literally looks grey and glum to me
"

It was an awful 18 months"
"My psychiatrist helped me find the right meds, I went to therapy with someone trained in brainspotting (which was phenomenal for my ADHD brain), and changed jobs"
"

My bf and family were so supportive during that time as well...my bf took over chores, my mom cooked for us, and my grandmother helped me with laundry every week"
"I've been off antidepressants for almost 3 years now.

I'm sorry you're going through this right now...but I hope that you can find the right combination of support for you❤️"
"There is so much great insight in this thread!

I sometimes find it helpful to know the answer to the question “is this my adhd or is this my depression” when I JUST CANT"
"My rule of thumb is:
ADHD = I want to, BUT (I’m paralyzed on the couch/i can’t focus/i forgot/i just can’t seem to bring myself to etc)
depression = I don’t even want to, or I should (with a big dose of shame)

That helps me understand which form of intervention I need to get going.

It makes me SO MAD that one of the tried and true ways of getting yourself out of a depressive spiral is to cosplay as someone without depression lol"
"No matter how hard I tried, I inevitably failed"
"Despite new motivations, new plans, new strategies, none worked"
I'd give 110% only to fall flat for one reason or another
"

When I noticed that I was giving up, giving in to passive lethargy, quitting the battle I was losing, I looked for help"
Help helped
"Hang in there, OP."
"One of the biggest things is the abundance of mental energy but no physical energy (before depression, I was pretty energetic in both areas)"
And executive function is ten times worse
"And I think, in general, symptoms like impulsivity and inability to focus just get worse."
I am not medicated yet
I just feel like everything is hopeless and I will not ever feel secure with my life.
"Honestly, this is my base level right now."
R u me?
Always just want to lay down
Thank you for saying this.
I feel so bad for not being able to put it into words
And the worst ist that I even couldn't start crying like I want to express those feelings somehow but I am so numb it is really hard sometimes.
Thank you
Yeah I am already with a therapist
They asked me what bugs me the most right now and that we should set priorities for what to do (they said it in a different way but essentially that) and I just was completely blank slated and couldn't even tell anymore what my problem was
Like I just went completely blank.
"Definitely many, many things I can relate to."
Yeah it's always the no energy right? Or like the no caring? It's like everything suddenly becomes so freaking hard.
Honestly exercise never has done anything for me
I wonder why
Everyone is saying to do sports but I don't feel better at all
I am not on medication yet
If this will proceed I will consider it
I had bad episodes in every phase of my life and it frequently occurs
"But I am finally not fighting it, but trying to understand it and going to therapy."
If you need help reach out to someone if you didn't already
You are loved.
"Honestly, it could also be that"
Like I was absolutely relieved the first few weeks
"But now I just see a load of work and all the ""missed years"" also pull me down"
I always had issues with finding a job that interests me long-term
And I always thought I couldn't make decisions or find out what makes me happy in life
"And now that I know that it was just not a feeling but a fact and that I maybe will never know what I should do with myself in that regard sort of ""validates"" that fear, if that makes sense?

Like, I can never know if i go for a job route, if I will still like it a year or 6 months down the line because that is the latest when it just fades and I have zero to none interest in proceeding with it."
"Yeah, I definitely felt like that for a long time"
"It felt impossible to balance things, days felt so long"
"Are you struggling to do basic tasks, like showering or eating? Not doing those definitely compounds my negative feelings even if doing them doesn’t fix the depression"
I find I spiral a lot more often if I don’t meet my needs :/
Welcome to the fucking club mate
When my depression kicks in hard - seeing a way out is near impossible
My mind tells me it’s time to wrap it up and take an early exit
The shit part is that I know my mind is playing tricks on me and I just need to be patient and gentle with my mental

When I get a moment of calm, I remind myself that I’ve been here before and made it out of the hole, that there’s always tomorrow being a new day"

He just asked you are you in the Northern hempishere? If i would that hopeless I would be relieved but his comment
 If I was feeling strongly
About something
"Like ok logic, the lack of light is affecting me"
Or at least being able to rule that out
Would be comforting and calm me down even if temporarily

I get it.
"Ever think about switching therapists? I know that sounds like a lot, but it might help"
"For me, the only reason I got out of one of my depressive spells was my therapist"
"She was amazing, but I did eventually outgrow her"
"

I'm just saying, it might be worth looking into finding someone who specializes in depression, because they'll know not to ask what your priorities are"
"Instead, they'll be working on trying to help you rediscover *what* priorities are for you in the first place (important distinction if it makes any sense)"
"It's like it doesn't matter what came first the chicken or the egg, we've first gotta figure out why we care about the chicken at all."

"I don’t do sports, just regular walks and the gym on occasion"
You can’t be mentally healthy if you’re not physically healthy and you gotta start somewhere
Totally get if it doesn’t work though
Good on you for starting the process of bettering yourself though! Hope everything goes well
So kind
I am getting help
It's just a long road.
"Brushing my teeth only once a week, Yeah I guess I struggle with it"
Honestly the thing that kills me the most is that nothing is fun anymore and I just can't get rid of that doomsday/hopelessness feeling
"Like I can't take existing anymore it is so painful.
I'm way more impulsive and I get like ""depression attacks"" every few hours which make those bad feelings way more intense"
I just want to isolate myself from everyone and feel alone and extremely uncared for.
Thank you so much.
"Yes, I am in the nothern hemisphere"
Everything got a lot darker recently
But normally i like fall/winter more than other seasons so that would be weird.
"I'm just five sessions in with her but she specializes in ADHD, Depression, Anxiety but I just couldn't tell her What's up so she probably tried to figure it out that way.
I feel so take care of and safe with her and I can get by the days easier, when I have the Note for the next appointment next to my bed, so I don't want to switch rn honestly."
It takes a while to find a good psychiatrist or a good primary care doctor that is licensed to prescribe medication for depression
"There’s no questionnaire, usually you just list your symptoms or straight up tell the office that you have depression and it’ll go in your file"
If you aren’t anti-medication I highly recommend trying medications until you find one that works for you
"

It took me a long time of switching every 6-18 months to find a mostly effective cocktail"
I didn’t want to go back on an antidepressant but it ended up being my only option
I could recommend going in-patient to a short term crisis center but many aren’t reputable
I got lucky that the first and only one I have gone to was a comfortable and supportive environment
"

Best of luck OP, let me know if you need more specific help or advice on where to go from here"
"It’s a lonely, painful place I wouldn’t wish on anyone."
If I have hard times and go for a walk it doesn't help at all
"I am not obese or anything like that, so sort of physically healthy"
I get skin Irritation when I am Feeling too warm and the feeling of sweat dripping down just annoys me so much it is insane
Maybe I am autistic as well.
It is
I am on it too
"If you ever need to talk to someone, feel free to reach out."
"Anecdotally i have had issues with inconsistent brushing, my dentist recommended a higher fluoride toothpaste for me.
i have needed way fewer fillings since switching"
but i have also set myself to go for a checkup and clean a couple if times a year
they keep booking it for me so i dont have to think about it.
"More than other seasons? Why? Like I love fall and winter at it best magic, or like so are all seasons"
"
I love spring, not more than other seasons, but I go crazy in the nature"
I go wild with them wild herbs
Because around my parts there is a lot of snow and mountains
"And I hate heat, it just is a very bad feeling."

You know what would help? Medication
GOOD LUCK.
Timers helped me when my kid was 7
"When the timer goes, it means X"
"
And then a big wall clock with a countdown and stuff like that"
"
Exercise - get them out of the house and run them down"
"
Reward charts"
10 mins of focus doing x equals 1 sticker
10 stickers = a tv show or a popsicle.
"So, this is probably going to run counterintuitive to how you'd manage a 12 year old, but honestly, it might help to create more structure for her"
"

For example, morning routine"
"Now that she's 12, what does she need to do to get ready in the morning? Shower every single day, remember to put on deodorant, acne treatments, maybe makeup? Sit down with her and help her figure out not only what she needs to do, but how much time it will take her to do it"
Set alarms if you need to (and build in extra time)
And actually have her write this down (if she's willing
You could even make a poster)
"I know it sounds dumb and baby-ish, but if you want to make it sound cool and grown up, you can say that by writing things down, she's activating her limbic system, which is responsible for memory, and she not only has a written list to refer back to, but she's creating a new neural pathway, too"
"

Make a checklist for school: does she have her homework, planner, calculator, pens, pencils, books, lunch, what else? Laminate it, put a copy by the door and maybe one in her backpack"
"

When she gets home, same thing, what's the routine, what does she need to complete it? 

The thing about ADHD at that age is that they go from sort of knowing what to expect and how to do things to all of a sudden having more demands placed on them (middle school work is usually more in depth and independent), and the demand of their body changing and the demands to be more social and the importance of it"
So they now don't know how to manage anything or cope
Providing a little more structure and guidance is helpful until they figure it out again.
"Diet will really help calm them down, issue is you really can’t change that part of your just the nanny"
Both Children probably have too much sugar in the diet along with low levels of B1 and Magnesium which are the 2 best calming nutrients.
Afraid that's not my choice LOL
Also cut out any and all food colouring if you’re in the U.S
 that helps.
Their diet is actually REALLY good
Mom believes in vitamins and supplements and they're on a few
They're also not allowed a lot of sugar.

"Hi, I have a question about a symptom I feel, and if medication could help, I constantly need to change the movie, or video game I’m playing I can’t simply sit down and enjoy what I’m doing"

"Yeah, there's already a chance of a heart attack without the anxiety and if you get a full blown panic attack then it might be end game for you"

I remember when I was told dissociating wasn’t “normal” and that not everyone did that"
"My friend was like, yeah that’s only for the mentally ill 🤣🤣🤣"
"

Look, if you, like me, are going through absolute HELL right now, I say enjoy the dissociation"
Let it ride
My therapist is a firm believer in it.
"some days or moments i just feel so detached from reality though lol, but i need to be super focused"
i have a lot going on that requires concentration and my attention
but a lot of the times i just feel like i'm watching myself work and im not actually present
"like i'll be watching a lecture video, but then i realize i'm zoning out, or my eyes will lose focus and i can't focus them back in"
"the words won't sound like words, just sound"
it's weird.
"AHHHH, yap"

I'm going through the same thing and I'm labeling the peak of dissaciation

I focus on them
"Meditation helps, yoga"

But yeah, meds."
"i can't see a therapist, i have strict parents and they don't believe in mental illness related things"

I have a room full of hobbies I cycle through depending on when my hyperfixation hits on one of them
Half a tonne of half finished projects
Probably thousands spent on equipment and supplies
"Meds have made it slightly better, but I still haven't finished my coat that I have been making for 5 years."
I feel you
I've learned that my hobby is collecting hobbies
Poor me
😅
"As someone who got diagnosed with AuDHD, I feel you"
It's infuriating when things are left incomplete
 Time blindness and ADHD paralysis makes life so much difficult and nobody understands it sometimes
Delaying certain things causes fear of failure and rejection triggering anxiety and insomnia
😭 I pray everyday for a better day.
"Best thing to do with hobbies: Don’t force them, if you are doing a hobby and don’t feel like doing it, you will burn out very fast, if you aren’t feeling it, just walk away, come back to it only when you want to."
I know this
I can absolutely relate to that
I always wondered why I can't keep my hobbies
Why I don't really have any
And the only one I have (chess) is getting neglected so hard even though I don't want to
I want to pursue them
But there is nothing that can motivate me even doing the things I like
I just want to get my life together
I feel you
I’m not sure how old you are but one trick I’ve used my whole life is to turn my commute into my thing
" 

When I lived in the mountains, I’d bike to school and then work"
 I live in the flatlands now so I ride my electric skateboard
 You have to get to work or school so you can’t not do it
"Once you figure out a fun alternative commute, you start to think about how to make it better"
You tech out and dial it in
"You keep track of your times, personal bests, that type thing"
"

It’s also the only kind of exercise I’ve been able to stick to"
"When we moved to a new city I told my wife- I don’t care what hours you want, as long as I can bike to work"
" 

Here’s the other thing- chill out on yourself!  You haven’t ruined anything"
"We all have tried shit-tons of hobbies and bailed on them, who cares?  Maybe you just haven’t found the right hobby"
"

There’s a benefit too-  once you pile up enough abandoned hobbies you can find something to talk about with damn near anyone"
The delight people get when you actually know about the thing they’re into
"I can spend hours talking about bikes, skis, computers, RC cars, Rockets, sailing, surfing, fishing, climbing, politics, philosophy, forging, geology, flint napping, disc golf… this list doesn’t stop because I’m old"
" 

The learning phase of hyper fixation lasts long enough for you to engage in deep banter with people who don’t expect to meet someone that can relate to their hobby because most people didn’t spend a summer panning for gold and then never doing it again"
"

The whole “Jack of all trades but master of none” fails to mention how fun Jack is at a party."
"It's tough to ""force""  myself to do what I like most of the time"
"Exactly! And it's so hard, we dont be on one thing for long time and can't even enjoy any hobbies genuinely"
hobbies what hobbies if i cant focus on my work and end up staying later to do it? : (
I have spent way too much money on hobbies that I don't do anymore
I am also AUDHD and was undiagnosed until this year at 31
I feel your pain and sympathise with this struggle.
I was lucky enough to be high functioning for most of my life
ADHD still undermined me and my life choices in dozens of ways
"But I did have a career, a business, and hobbies"
"

Now that it has gotten worse? This is hell"
"I hear you as ADHD has robbed me of so much, including the hobbies that I used to love"
I wish there was a cure
"Vyvanse helps me at least, but as of yet I have not found a dose or combination of things which restore me even to the level I was at.

I wish I had a solution for all of us."
I have AuDHD too and I cycle through hobbies.
"So, this is how I think of it:

My main, overarching, umbrella hobby is art"
I make art
"Obviously, there are different ways to make art: painting, woodworking, pottery, performing arts, fiber arts, design, etc"
"And within those subcategories, there are various skills associated with each particular area that one needs to cultivate in order to be successful, but they all tie together"
"

For example, in theatre, you have the technical elements like lighting, sound, and rigging that require the knowledge of things like electricity, sound frequencies, how to mix sound, how to program a light or sound console, weights and pullups, tensile strength"
"Then you have design elements where you have to know about color, mood, creating an aesthetic"
"You have costumes where you have to have practical sewing skills, knowledge of historical and current fashion, how fibers move and work, how to clean and maintain fabrics and wigs"
Makeup is another department and all that comes with that
"And your scenic design and construction, which requires knowing how to build things out of lots of different materials"
"Then props, which is making, buying, or sourcing all kinds of stuff"
"

And that's all backstage"
"That's nothing to do with performing and what you need to know about how to use the voice, the body, how to convey emotions without words, to convey things about class or a relationship, how to sing with a mic, without a mic, dancing, how to do 8 shows a week and not die"
"

Like, there are so many elements to just that one overarching hobby, but it's really just making art"
"And I look at it as, what project am I working on right now"
"And I switch around my projects depending on what needs to be completed first, or just because I need a change of pace (after spending a week hunched over a sewing machine, I need to standup and paint for a while"
"

TL;DR is there one overarching category that your hobbies fall into and can you look at that as your hobby?"
"I’m sorry you’re struggling to find a hobby that doesn’t “fade in and out.” Keep looking - I know there’s something for you!

I get it"
The guitar in my office has been there for 16+ years and I play it very rarely
"Every few years I say I’m going to learn and then I lose interest quickly.

Like others have mentioned, what about a hobby that has various “sub-hobbies” to keep you entertained? I’ve loved running for nearly 30 years since starting in high school"
"

In high school I ran long sprints plus cross country"
During university I did my first marathon and a bunch of random running
Discovered trail and mountain running after graduating
"I love ultrarunning and have done some ridiculously long events, but recently had so much fun doing a local relay with my family."
">yet no one I know gets it

Same"
Perhaps we can find some solace in knowing that we strangers get it.
"My space is filled with a hyperfixation of electronics, 3D printers, laser engravers, and so much more"
I feel the pain
The AUDHD is so hard to fight sometimes and I don’t understand why it’s so difficult
"

Like you said, meds help, but the brain still does crazy things."
Gundam has been a really good hobby for me
It’s not hard
"They are cheap(can be expensive for the higher quality ones) and if I don’t feel like building them I just watch the shows in bed, still feels like I’m participating lol"
"I usually do it with a podcast on, but it’s really nice in complete silence if you get over stimulated, and who doesn’t like giant fighting robots?"
Its so draining to be rapid fire cycling through hobbies
I want a hobby I can enjoy for longer than a week! Why is that so hard?
As someone with both same as you and that’s wants to do things in life and improve I feel you
"Exactly! I've been told by so many people to just 'get a hobby', and most of them don't even realize I struggle to do things I *want* to do, like out of my own volition! Everytime I do have hobbies, or something small, they're drowned out by my tangential hyperfixations that don't last more than a month"
I have a full drawer full of bracelet-making supplies that has been gathering dust for a month now 😭😭.
I feel like my ADHD ruins dreams and ambitions more than my hobbies
"I have few hobbies anyway to begin with (reading, journalling, and gaming) but when it comes to personal projects, that becomes the issue."
"Feel that, I find it hard to keep hobbies due to hyperfixations, but also because if I'm not the best at something I get so upset with myself and give up, video games is my favourite hobby but I can't tell you how many games I've flip flopped through cause I've 'struggled' aka not been 100 percent amazing at it the minute I picked it up lmao"
I finally found one that sticks for me
I got into painting DnD minis and have adored it the last year or so
🫶🏼
"Meds are going to help you with your ADHD symptoms, but they won't teach you how to deal with you mental blocks or your expectations"
Consider why it's so terrible that your interests fluctuate
Consider why you get into a hobby
"These are important questions for most people, but even more important for us"
"For me consistency in my endeavors seems unattainable, and it might always be, though I think that by deconstructing my expectations I do give myself more room for consistency"
The biggest motivation killer is expectations
"

Through thinking about these things, I've found that what I want most out of any hobby, is to avoid cultivating negative feelings towards it"
"It means accepting to put it on ice when things get crazy or boring, it means not feeling shame for doing that, but pride as I preserve my curiosity for the next thing"
"What has hurt me the most has been to fixate on completion or achieving goals, which took up alot of time that could have been used looking at other interesting stuff"
"If it's draining your energy, don't be afraid to let it go, it's yours anyways and you will come back to it when you are ready."
"We're all works in progress our whole lives, we're responsible for coming up with strategies to do better every single day and taking small steps forwards."
"Lol, this is why I don't even start hobbies anymore"
1
"The goal of a hobby is not to get as good as possible as fast as possible.

2"
"The Internet provides too much information and stimulation towards a new hobby.

Both of these problems create an unsustainable level of excitement to the beginning of a hobby which will always fade.

The solution is to completely remove the Internet from a new hobby"
"No social media, no guides, no online shopping, no researching optimum methods etc.

It sounds harsh or even pointless, but think of it this way - if you aren't motivated enough to learn the hobby on your own terms, finding the necessary information with actual physical effort, and if you don't simply enjoy the hobby regardless of making consistent progress.."
Is it really the hobby for you?
Possible
I made rap music from 14 - 27
"I have now been playing guitar for 2 years.

But"
I also have expensive mountain bike that I never use
Stopped poker
Software coding
Tennis
"

So yeah , just find your thing"
This is why I'm a digital artist
I don't even need to get out of bed haha
Just my tablet and me baby
Currently woodworking
"Past:coin collecting (about $30,000 in coins that I don’t touch anymore)metal detecting ( $2,500 in gear)ham radio ($2,000), then the all things engine phase ($5,000 in tools and such), bought a keep to restore currently sitting in the backyard for the last 4 years, kitchen remodel have four tiles left can’t finish it and all the cabinet doors are off waiting for me to build new ones, chess, racketball, oh wait…can’t forget the “art phase” various paintings on the wall ($1,000), microbiology (microscop petri dishes), astronomy (telescope), firearms ($15,000), archery, if I sit and think about it this list goes on and on"
Every thing last for about 3-6 months
And then a new one comes along
Just for reference I am mid 40’s so I have been at this for a while.
"The thing with adhd is we can't fight it, so you have to have the tools to work with it, and finding those tools by yourself is basically impossible - have you looked into getting an adhd coach? 
If its something you really want and it's for your mental health it will be worth it, they will help you with the tools and accountability."
"I don’t have autism so I can’t relate to that part, but I know what you mean it’s frustrating to not have the typical progression on hobbies"
I’ve kind of resigned to the fact my hobbies are as seasonal as the daily weather
"

At least my interest and persistence is predictable, I’ve had on and off interest in art and drawing but the years stack up and I still made progress despite drawing a few times a year.

I believe in the concept that life can get better as you’re older"
Practicing improves your skills in anything
Here's the great news
You can be healed
Jesus died on the cross for you

have a wonderful day.

"Same, started cross stitching now my embroidery hoop is sitting next to my bed with a project i completed like 3%"
I really enjoy doing cross stitching
"I hate this disorder...

I feel like the only hobby i consistantly come back to is playing video games."
"This is exactly what I mean its so daunting and idk about you but makes me feel like a ""quitter"" or that I suck at what I do because very one is better due to practice"
"Not sure if it is/could be an additional diagnosis but unfinished projects give me massive anxiety that turns to stress, panic attacks, anger and mild/moderate depression"
" 

I’m newly diagnosed with adhd and have long hated that i can’t stick to a hobby."
"All those hobbies, is that a ADHD thing? I want to try everything I don't mind too much not finishing anything."
"I didnt realize this was an ADHD thing before I realized I had ADHD, I just thought everyone does it because I noticed my dad does it too"
" I'm not sure if its because I'm just going through the cycle again, but what's helped me start to finish my projects is seeing my pile of shame and not wanting to see the money I already spent go to waste."
I know that feeling
I have a pillow I’ve been working on for 15 years
Same
 It was actually a big deal for me to realize and accept this
 Now i don't confuse losing interest in a hobby with depression
 And it's also way easier for me to let go of an old hobby and sell off as much of it as I can to fund my newest
 Sold some collectibles to fund a guitar recently.
"It's so hard, sometimes I do wish to live a life without AUDHD 😭"
"Burnout is the worst I had that happen really bad last year among other things I crashed and it resulted in my dropping out of school, definitely don't want that again so I try just going with the flow"
"Literally and idk about you or other but then I even question if the hobbies are for fun or just to seem somewhat interesting because everytime i go to do them all I can't think is ""Wow, I really suck and don't want to do this."""
This is so very helpful I didn't even think of it like that
The random knowledge I've actually gotten from hobbies and learning random facts has actually helped more that I realise.
Exactly its horrible and istg no one else gets it
If I force myself to get out of bed and go for a jog in the morning my whole day is improved.
I'm really glad u finally got diagnosed my mother was just diagnosed last year to I can't imagine how you feel it'd a struggle
"Exactly! I'm also seen to be high functioning but Adhd still interrupted my everyday life, and still continues to"
"Its apart of me, and don't get me wrong I wouldn't wish to be ""normal"" but then at the same time I would because I'd love to be able to have an easier life"
"Especially because everyone deems adhd as ""hyper"" when it's do much more than that"
"Actually yeah kind of I guess mine would fall under ""arts"" as well poetry, writing, singing, guitar, drawing occasionally"
"I know one thing, they're all somewhat creative or force me to use my imagination even the things like gaming or reading result in my imagination being used so there's that!"
I'll be honest it does make me slightly emotional knowing there's strangers ill never meet that understand the pain
MY UNCLE HAS ADHD AND LIKES THEM! they look so cool everyone loves fighting robots lol
Exactly!! Hopefully we'll get there eventually
Yeah I totally agree
"I’m really struggling atm as I feel that I don’t have any faith in myself that I will see something through past a few days, maybe a couple of weeks"
I can’t stick to anything
"I’m a very creative and intelligent person and I want an outlet and to improve myself, but it’s at the point now where I don’t want to start anything because there is literally no point"
I have abandoned pretty much everything that doesn’t have a hard deadline/external pressure to stick with
And wasted tens of thousands of dollars at this point in my life on pointless pursuits
It’s probably the hardest aspect of ADHD for me.
I also have this issue! Trying to achieve something feels even more overwhelming and daunting than the hobby itself
"I relate so bad, the minute something gets repetitive and I can't win I dip"
Its happened with so much games that I love 😭
"DnD has also I interested me, painting figures sounds like a lot of fun!"
"Thank you, I'll try to not get upset or negative when things don't go the way I want them to including hobbies not sticking 🫶"
I have a camhs worker (idk if you know what that is but it's a mental health worker for minors) but that's more trauma related although still helpful
Maybe I'll look into getting an ADHD coach to help me.
What a crock
"Um I'm hellenistic and Jesus can't heal my neurological disorders, if he happens to be real he gave me them so..."
this is sage advice
[deleted]
Did medication not help? I left a lot of projects unfinished
"Now that im medicated, the only thing stopping me is scheduling the time and locking it in."
"YES! It's exactly that way with my ""guitar-playing hobby"""
"The only exception is chess, but for that I need to be on a chess tournament to really get into that, otherwise it's all the same all over again"
"I'm not good enough, I'm not invested enough, and I loose interest even though I'm like.."
Interested?! And I can't even explain it to myself
My first thought when reading your post was - We don’t suck at hobbies! We’re great at hobbies! I’ve had a ton of them
" :)

A bigger problem for me is not coming off as a know it all when I talk to someone who is into a hobby I’ve already burned though."
Not even my former therapist
"I know it's good, this part is covered, the issue is to actually do it for more than 2 days"
It is truly a relief to know that I am not just stupid and lazy
"Also, I have found meds that work for me."
I wish I could go back knowing what I know now and also never have it get worse
"Hyper focus can be amazing, and I think had I known back then I could have taken steps to better counter the negative aspects.

But now it’s just a nightmare without meds."
"So there you go! You're gonna write your own album of songs, perform them, and make the album art :) 

Honestly, most artists I know are always working on at least three different projects at once"
"When art is your job, it's still work, and vacillating between projects helps keep the creativity going"
Quite literally
"Your brain needs something new and novel, so when you switch to another activity, especially one where different physicality is involved, you keep activating your brain"
"

I know the hard and frustrating part is feeling like you never finish anything you start"
"And believe me, I totally get that"
I have so many unfinished projects right now
"Artificial deadlines, or even real ones can help with that sometimes"
"Like if you've been working on a song for a while but haven't had the push to finish, maybe enter yourself in an open mic night"
"I know there's two sides to it--sometimes it gives you the motivation, sometimes it's too overwhelming"
But it's worth a shot
"

Another thing that can help is sharing your work with another creative friend"
"When I'm writing, I will often send things to my friend who writes,  and they will ask, well, what happens next? Or they'll tell me how to improve if it's not coming together like I want and we'll bounce ideas back and forth"
I also find going to see the art of others really gets me wanting to work on my own art
"Museums, plays, shows, etc"
Good luck :)
For what it’s worth I change hobbies every month or so but this one’s been a constant for me!
That has been my issue since
I completed a short story compilation to be published online but I haven't done it yet
"I want to start writing to advocate mental health but I've only done that what, 2-3 days? Same"
I recall liking sketching and painting at one point and even bought the stuff for it
Only to toss it aside later on
I have all sorts of accessories attached to various interests and hobbies but have been unable to get on with it
The only hobby that has ever remained with me is my reading.
"I'm so bad with it 😭😭 doesn't help I'm so emotional with it, when I play games with my partner and I notice he's doing better than me I start to spiral thinking I'm not good enough and cry 😭😭"
"A coach differs to a therapist (I'm assuming that is?) this might help explain the difference - 
https://add.org/how-to-find-an-adhd-coach/

I've had both in the past, they both have their benefits but therapy won't really help with life skills type stuff which is where a coach comes in and I found it really helpful."
Ahh makes sense thank you so so much! This could be really really helpful!
I haven’t tried meds yet
I recently just got diagnosed with ADHD
Yeah that makes sense maybe I should try looking at it in a more optimistic light
That's amazing! And yeah my mother said the exact same thing
What meds?
You're the biggest help ever it's actually made me a bit emotional cuz I don't want to give up the only hobbies I have and let ADHD run my life honestly that's just too exhausting
They do look insanely cool maybe I'll get one and try it out!!
LITERALLY
"I was playing with my friend and had to tell them ""don't pass my level, please cuz ill get annoyed and stop playing"" because I didn't want to get mad at them 😭 literally every game I have is sitting collecting dust physically or on my desk top because I stopped playing half way through😭"
"A problem I actually had (before I knew this was just a thing we do) was that I realized that I would get into a hobby, spend a ton of money, and then get bored of it"
"When I was younger I didn't have a ton of money so it bothered me that I was ""wasting"" all that money on these hobbies, so once I noticed the trend I decided to stop it"
"But then after several years of not diving into hobbies, I started to feel like a boring shell of my former self"
"So now I let myself get into hobbies that interest me, I just think hard before spending a lot of money to make sure it doesn't end up expensive artifacts sitting in a closet."

I find years worth of psychiatrist bills to be a wonderful investment
"I don’t observe a tax return per se, but I have a pretty good idea of what the alternative would look like."
"At the beginning of every winter, I usually find about $50 worth of notes in the pockets of my various jackets I haven't worn in 6 months"
"My country is heading towards being cashless though, so it doesn't happen as much as it used to."
It's like finding money that you stashed and long forgot! Congratulations on your excellent find today!
I have lost so many earplugs it's unbelievable
Then I got headphones this time last year and I never lose them
If you can deal with the bulkiness they're so much harder to lose.
"Leaving things in your Amazon cart, failing to complete the check out, only to return to cart and decide you no longer need the item(s)"
Put a sign on top of your washing machine if you own it telling you to check for pockets.
They make a harness that goes around your neck and might help keep them in place.
I cleaned out a drawer at work and found $5 :)
My husband makes fun of me for this
"But ever since I got my AirPod pros, I can locate them pretty easily and my phone warns me if I leave  them anywhere"
"Usually one bud is in my bra, the other under my dresser or couch."
"I washed my galaxy bud pro 2s once, and they survived"
I forgot my iPad on a flight once
Thank goodness someone turned it in and I was able to file a lost item report and actually got it mailed back to me!
did you try the bag of rice trick?
Have you considered buying a squaretrade or Asurion insurance for the next set? Only issue is following through on filing out the form when needed.
"I like my skullcandy headphones with built in tile, but they aren't great through the washing machine"
 First time they came back around no problem
Took the case apart and put it all in my dehydrator after a quick rinse with some iso alcohol
" If you keep  washing them in the washing machine that method doesn't keep working forever, so I had to buy a new pair, but at least I know where they are"
 I think even their cheapest pairs have Tile now.
I have done this to two pair
I found about $100 worth of Starbucks gift cards when I cleaned my room after several years.
"My earbud trick is galaxy Buds with a long battery life and GPS, a locking carabiner, and aftermarket latching case"
Got the galaxy Buds 2pros on release 2+ years ago and every 6 months or so  it's walking around for an hour listening for chirping but always find it
I finally did my taxes after 3 years and got a tax return
I might qualify for the last stimulus that got sent and I didn’t receive since I hadn’t done my taxes 😣
"OP, get a case for them that lets you put them on your keys / on a carabiner...it was a game changer for me lol my keys are now so big (keys, cute keyrings, headphones) that its impossible to not notice them in my pants with the noise they make so now i dont accidentally wash them"
I always find computer add ons that  I put away and as weird as it sounds I always forget how many keyboards (Corsair gaming keyboards) and head sets (Astro A40) I have I found three working headsets this year lol
You’re even Steven!
Quite an interesting way to think about it and boy is it true
"Exactly what I did, bulky yes, can I put them in my pocket and lose them no."
Seconding this
I’m embarrassed by the amount of earbud headphones I’ve lost
But over the ear ones I’ve managed to keep for 1.5 years which is a record for me!
Skullcandy with tile if you need earbuds
"

A brief selection of places I have found my headphones:  Laundry Hamper"
a couple houses down from mine on the sidewalk
 In my backyard behind the shed
 Under my dresser
Under the edge of my kitchen cabinets
Wherever the heck my cat knocked them to this time
 etc.
Let me tell you how I managed to lose a pair of headphones…..
"I have the bulky ones that curl round the ears, they are my longest running earphones"
They are also waterproof
And the battery lasts for weeks
Even when they are not in their case
Perfect for the ADHD brain.
"Good idea, and wash basket!"
I found $50 bucks a couple days ago while searching for some jewelry
They are in rice now we shall see
"Ok, I’m ready for story time."
Decent return lol
"I mean, it’s not even interesting :-( I forgot I even owned a pair, and when I finally cleaned my room AND my car (both a mess again), I came across the case they were supposed to go in, but they weren’t in there or anywhere"
I believe a little people in my house took them and are making better use of them.
20 of it was in a tampon box lol like wtf?
"The borrowers, I believe I have them too"
 When I lose my keys most times I find them in the fridge
"Wellm that’s just smart thinking, that way no one can steal you key fob signal"
"Here, just take my upvote"

Pharmacy is out of my meds

I swear cvs never has it switch to Walmart trustttt or a grocery store
If you take extended release ask if they have immediate release and vice versa
My friend had trouble getting adderall but she only had to switch to the immediate release for one month then her pharmacy had it back in stock. 
Your pharmacy should be able to check for you if other CVS pharmacies have it in stock to refill your prescription
I’ve had to do it twice before and they just let you know which CVS to grab it from
Just ask then if they are able to call around and get it refilled for you
That way you’re not the one doing all the work.
Try small local pharmacies
 So much better and likely to have than the cvs that everyone is going to
"Switching from Strattera to Concerta rn and walgreens didnt have it so i had my doctor switch it to walmart but they are not treating it with any urgency, told them yesterday at 3 pm and the doctor isn't gonna get it called in by today since they're already almost closed! Its the most frusterating thing ever, I've been off adhd meds for 4 days and I'm a full time college student approaching finals like imagine if I didn't pay for my appointment upfront and said I'd get to it when I get to it? Wish the doctors office would put some respect on my name lmao."
I went 6 weeks without it
I was in tears leaving my therapy appointment yesterday and said something to the receptionist
She called a private family owned pharmacy for me and sure enough they had it
"But my Meijer, Walmart and CVS have been out for weeks."
Currently using Walmart with no issues for my adderall
Haven’t had any issues with them in the past besides my psychiatrist waiting to send the scripts over until 5 minutes before the pharmacy closes
Walmart pharmacy staff have gone above and beyond to source my medication and I have a lot of hoops to jump through
"I would seriously give them my last 

Walgreens and, to a lesser extent, CVS were spectacularly unhelpful"
"Walgreens in particular - the local pharmacist adopted a policy where, if they could not immediately fill a prescription, they would ***cancel*** the prescription"
"As in, you'd have to beg your prescriber to re-issue it"
"My state does not allow prescriptions to be transferred but other pharmacies would at least hold the scrip until the medication comes in stock.

When I complained about this, one pharmacist actually said to me ""you know, you're really starting to fit the profile of an abuser."""
Seconding the grocery store recommendation
A local one is the only one I can find with it in stock - probably because they don't have a drive-thru.
I’ll look into that thank you :) I chose the cvs in target because it’s so close to me
I’ll definitely do that! Thanks :)
"So they said the one cvs had it, I called that cvs to confirm & they said they were out of stock too"
Calling pharmacies is a hassle because they normally have that automated messaging system so I think I’m more than likely going to go in person next time I run errands.
That’s maddening!! I’m so sorry!! I’ve been supplementing with extra caffeine to help my symptoms :(
I’ll have to try that! I’ll have to look into some smaller pharmacies then
I never had any problems with Target CVS in my hometown
"Then I moved out of state to a smaller rural area, and the one here sucked"
Their hours are super shitty and they're closed on weekends
"Even if they had my meds, I could never get over there to pick them up!

I switched to Walgreens, but during the pandemic, they started sucking"
"I tried Sam's club, but the pharmacist wanted my provider to jump through all these hoops, and it was awful"
So I've been at Safeway/Albertsons/Kroger for the last three years with no issues
"I think it really depends on the pharmacy staff, though"
"They know that our family gets a lot of prescriptions, so they really try to make sure they have things in stock for us."
Ya it’s a major hassle! If you go in person ask them to call for you to confirm
I’m pretty sure pharmacy workers call on a separate line where there is no wait
That’s what I’ve had done for me in the past anyway
Hope you’re able to figure it out!!
I need to try supplementing with caffeine! Thank you for your sympathy it's honestly been the most frustrating process ever.
My next try is Kroger! I live in Ohio so I’m going to try meijer as well & possibly Costco/ Sam’s club & even Walmart
I feel like a crack head trying to get my fix but adderall is the only medication that makes me feel normal.
"Oh I get it! Having adhd & being in college is tough! You got this though! When I was off my meds during nursing school I would turn on adhd music , drink a big coffee and force myself to focus on studying / doing school work."
I like using the Costco pharmacy when I can (we don't have one where I live now 😭)
"You can always talk to the pharmacist and ask them if you brought your prescription here, how difficult would it be to get it filled monthly"
"If you have other smaller mom and pop pharmacies, they also usually are better stocked, or at least the communication is easier."

it is basically not their problem you can't remember stuff- buy a small notebook and start writing important stuff down
this is now your external memory!
"I think the reality is that despite our condition making things like that hard to follow through on or remember, these things have real-world consequences for real people.

If I were in your position, I’d start writing down these things when they tell you"
"I have a great memory for some things, but small to-do items is not one of them"
"I used to let those slip through the cracks all the time, but now I take copious notes to ensure it doesn’t happen"
"It’s not your employer’s job to find the solution for you.

I’d talk to your boss or supervisor and say “hey, I’m sorry, I realize I’ve struggled with missing a few critical deadlines recently"
I’m working on a solution so that doesn’t happen in the future
Is there any one place where all of these specific due dates are written down?”
"Remember, while your ADHD are not your fault, they are your responsibility"
"As much it sucks, you can’t blame other people for your own brains shortcomings"
We just need to work a little harder than other people at some things
"It’s not fair, but it’s also not their problem."
"Excuses are just problems without a solution my friend 

You have a problem with no solution remembering things and that causes fuck ups"
"Thats an excuse 

You have a problem remembering things so you write them down and left your notebook at the office so you have to go back"
"That’s a problem 

“I forgot all about that so I didn’t do it” - Excuse 

“I forgot all about that until my calendar alarm went off” - Problem 

No one wants to hear your excuses for a job you’re getting paid for, but most people would be happy to help with any problems that arise in the process of that"
"

So what’s your excuse for being homeless or having your car repossessed when you forgot to do your job? Who’s gonna care? Will they be willing to make your excuses their problem? 

Do you think we’re all walking around forgetting everything day in and day out and just saying “oh silly me” forgot I was running a bath and let the house flood"
"

Forgot my kids are at school because object permanence, forgot to put the leftovers up and wasted food because I left the room, I forgot to pay my mortgage because no one asked me too and I forgot"
"

Homie you’re typing this on a phone that has a built in calendar and notes app"
"

My solutions aren’t your solutions"
"You can decide what’s important to you and keep track of it instead of letting everyone around you know you think so little of them that you won’t even write it down lmao 

Get some amphetamines, a pen, a pad of paper, and get your shit together"
"I'm gonna sound like a dick, but this is constructive criticism"
It shouldn't take you 6 months to learn a new task
90 days at most
6 months to be proficient
If you cant learn task in 90 days dont do that job
"Your just gonna burt everyone else, with time and money, and possibly safety"
"If memory problems, are your issue"
"Get a white board, notebook, or something"
"I advise against anything that can close, I have similar memory issues"
"If I don't see it in front of me, I will likely forget"
"If you need to pay invoices, PAY THEM IMMEDIATELY"
"Parts come in, pay for it"
"I used to work  in a position where I had to order parts, pay for parts, look up labor times, answer phones, etc."
"Trying to advocate for more grace and less rigor from trainers, is seldom heard until they see you putting in the effort."
Whenever I’m told a procedure I add it to my notes app
Then I don’t look incompetent forgetting what to do
It’s all about managing your memory so you can still function enough to hold down a job.
"If it’s not in a location where you can print it off, you may have to write everything down yourself"
"In a lot of situations, you have to accommodate yourself rather than wait for other people to do that"
It looks like this may be one of those situations.
Use a note app of some sort
Jot the one sentence down that you need “no late fee for x until x days”
"

At the end of each day email all the notes to yourself"
Then you can search fines and all your note memos will show up
"For real and listen to me, make it simple af for you if this is too much"
Just make it easy to search through in the future.
"I agree with writing stuff down, but also, official things should be in email so we can refer back to them"
"Like, if it's important, it should be sent officially."
"As much as taking notes is important, like others are saying, it's not the only solution"
"I know that I myself sometimes forget to take notes, or focus too much on the notes and miss the next thing the person is saying.

Something I've started doing is ask people to send ""meeting minutes"" by email after a call"
This is pretty much just listing in bullet points what was discussed and what the next steps are
"Or if I get a new request/requirement from someone, I ask them to send an official email with the details so we have something to reference in the future.

Ideally, your company should also have training documents for new hires"
"If they don't, maybe that's something you could bring up to your manager"
Having these documents would save time for everyone - the new hires wouldn't forget what the rules are and the rest of the team wouldn't have to constantly spend time explaining things
It's a win-win
"If nobody cares still, that's something you could start as a side project if you're up for it (documenting what you learn so that the next employees after you don't suffer the same way)."
I love OneNote in microsoft
"I take screenshots, jot down all sorts of stuff from meetings"
If the info is new or unclear I try to ask or follow-up immediately after with presenter to confirm my understanding
"It’s not perfect but cuts down on number of these issues.

They still don’t sound nice, but adapting work to you for memory problems would probably require you to go through a formal accommodation process if they offer something like that"
"
    
I’ve not worked up courage to explore accommodations at my work despite wanting some like “Can record meetings”, “Require weekly check-ins instead of monthly.” I’m working on how to just make myself accomplish these things without asking and signaling “Hey I struggle!” My work culture not great for that"
"  

Best of luck you friend!"
I rewrite my reminders/To Do list on a fresh page every morning and last thing on a Friday
"This means nothing gets forgotten if I've taken pages of notes or meeting minutes etc.
I've also started a ""Reminder car park"" You know those tasks that randomly pop into your head when you are working on something else and you think ""crap if I don't do this NOW it will disappear into the brain abyss again""
Open a Post it on your laptop desktop and type whatever unrelated random To Do into it as it occurs to you"
Then you have a reminder somewhere AND you don't lose the damn post it note.
"I make myself cheat sheets for everything: procedures, processes, what to do in case of issues, etc"
"Or I take pictures, just so I have something handy to refer back to"
"Because I know it can be annoying to keep being asked the same thing over and over again, not to mention it makes me look like I don't care about my job"
"

The other thing I do is I approach the person and I'll say something like, ""Hey supervisor person, I know you've told me this before, but I just want to make sure I have it correct"
"When we do X, the first step is ____, then we____"
"Do I have that right?""

Most of the time, when you say it like that and put the onus on yourself, they're more likely to help you rather than scold you."
"Write it down, make it into a company document, brownie points from your boss for documenting something that has never been properly documented."
"6 months is definitely quick to be doing the ""we already told you"" bit"
"That said, you will have to come up with ways to manage this"
"There's not a lot of detail in your post, but I take EXTENSIVE notes, all the time, to avoid this problem"
"I also follow up with emails - ""thanks for talking with me about this"
my understanding is xyz
"am I tracking this correctly?"""
I echo what most people are saying here
Having memory problems or whatever doesn't mean they just need to accept whatever mishaps come as a result because you have an excuse
"It's on you to do whatever you can to help set you up for success.

  
Now if they are just being unreasonable and their expectations are too high that's another thing"
But it sounds like this may be a combination of both.
I have a notebook
Like a dedicated pen and paper notebook
I write down EVERYTHING
Detailed notes + date
It helps
I would add to the comments that using speech to text after to expand on your notes to capture greater recollection is a great help if you're in that situation
Apps that use the open source Whisper speech-to-text engine are great
"On my Android, I use the Futo Voice Input or Futo Keyboard on a constant basis and it's fantastic"
"Almost instantaneous.


I don't personally suffer from the challenge that you do, but I can tell you that it's very frustrating from the other end if someone has to train you more than twice on the same thing"
"After about the third or fourth time trying to teach someone something, I give up because I have other things to do, and I'll just take care of it myself or send it to someone else"
"Remember that any time someone is training you, or teaching you something, they could be using that for their own projects, or they could be doing it themselves, and it would be faster"
"So Even though your memory condition is very frustrating to you, always have an attitude of gratitude when someone's taking the time to teach you, or the next time, they will simply be less likely to take the time to teach you."
Agreed! Whenever I have a new job I start a notebook and/or document where I write down ALL important info
"I take notes in meetings, and jot down things in 1-1s that I add to the doc after"
Basically like an instruction manual for my job
"

I've even had jobs use these documents (or part of them at least) as SOPs or for training assistance later."
Carry around a little notebook and call it your hard drive lol
I ALWAYS note down every task I have to do even if casually told in an excel file and the file is always open
I make a checkbox before that so I can track what I do and don't
"


They're paying me to work"
My productivity genuinely improved by this simple hack -obsessively keep track of things.
Came to say this
I have severe ADHD and I take notes in every meeting.
"I agree with this, but add, if possible, do this electronically"
I have a Samsung with an s pen and I can search my notes
I'm sure i don't have to explain the paper piles and half full notebooks
And trying to dig through them to find something i KNOW I wrote down
"I can write things down,  change it to text if I think I'm gonna need it more than just a bit, and search it later"
"Plus, that drive i have to use new pens, new paper, etc it's satisfied cuz I can change that whenever I want."
"Great tip, thanks"
I have been lazy
I'll try again
Thanks for the help
I agree about it being our responsibility
"But what do you say while tryong to figure things out? I mean, some things might take years to figure out and employers don't typically have years worth of patience"
"

I work in banking and I write a lot of things down but it results in a big mess"
"Not only that, but processing the things that I'm writing down after I have done so takes a significant amount of time"
"I'm trying different strategies and I'm always experimenting because I genuinely want to do better, but experimenting might lead to new mistakes and it might still be far from functional"
"

How do I advocate for myself when I'm trying my best but still not meeting expectations?"
">while your ADHD are not your fault, they are your responsibility

This is gangster advice"
"I have been overwhelmed but lazy.

I'll give it a better effort!"
"It's honestly wild that OP's exact procedures and requirements re: as important as *fines* isn't already documented! 

Like, why isn't that already something to reference outside of a conversation?! What happens should OP and the, what, two other people leave their roles?"
Not a dick
I appreciate the straight talking
">managing your memory

Ima train it to do tricks"
"Agreed.

> you have to accommodate yourself

This is a great help, thanks"
"It's available, but my co-workets took what I said the wrong way"
Then I got upset
"

Feeling better now"
All the advice has really helped
"They've good documents but this happened due to them misinterpreting my messeges.

I Easily could have phrased it better too but it upset me enough I was stewing and just posted here.

It's been a great response"
I've a great mentality to rely on based on everyone's response
">I’m working on how to just make myself accomplish these things without asking and signaling “Hey I struggle!” 

I believe in you!"
"You might've heard this, but I've learned to ask, ""I'm most successful at work when..."" instead of ""I struggle unless..."""
">Reminder car park

Starting this"
Amazing tip
Nice
Good tips
Now I want brownies
I've been struggling to take notes but everyone has been saying it helps so I'll give it a shot
1
"I'm freshly diagnosed and am struggling to accommodate for myself

2"
"I can do better

3"
I will do better
"My coworker (also ADHD) has a reMarkable notebook and it seems like an amazing tool- I, on the other hand, cannot afford one so have 6 different notebooks with all my notes since I started work that I will, one day, organise into a some sort of coherent guide 😅"
Nice!
"No worries, I think we’ve all been in that position, it’s part of growth.

The only reason I take notes on everything now is because I’ve forgotten so many small things that got me in trouble or embarrassed"
The only reason I’m always on time to anything work related now is because I was constantly late and getting in trouble or getting embarrassed.
"Calling it 'lazy' doesn't help! You just can't do it the way other people with better memories can.

I also have a terrible memory, and - ironically - many of my coworkers think I'm very well-organized  because they always see me taking notes

Also helpful:

* If your info isn't confidential, Google Notebook now has great AI tools for quickly searching and summarizing your notes when you need them
* For important stuff, email a summary of your notes to the person you met with as ""meeting recap"" or  ""my understanding of payment rules"" or something"
"This forces you to organize and summarize the material, which is helpful; gives them a chance to correct anything you got wrong; and also covers your ass so if there's a mistake later you can say ""I told you what I was going to do - why didn't you correct me if it was wrong?"""
"Nah, it's not being lazy"
You can't help it
"I have fatigue most of the time, but i also agree with the note taking."
"I’d recommend shifting your thinking:      
You failed and you learned"
"    
Yes it was ADHD that was the cause of the problem - but your solution is to do it differently"
Not necessarily that you are lazy
"            
Continued failure will lead to you being let go"
They hired someone to pay things timely
"It is your job to figure out how that will work within your needs:      
* Do you need extra time to discuss?      
* Do you need to review your decisions and timelines regularly?      
* Do you need to call some of these companies and ask for help there in case you forget - they can remind you?       
* Most likely - take ample notes, use sticky notes to identify what you need to do before you leave each day (throwing them out as you finish) - clean desk/time to leave, schedule time to schedule all of your reoccurring dates for payments"
"      
You will need to create the system that works for you in that role"
It will be the employers job to give you extra help or assistance with requests that are reasonable
Asking for forgiveness on one or two failures will be okay
Asking them to allow for repeated failures weekly that costs money and time - is not reasonable.
"That's tough, I wish I had a good universal answer, but I'm still working on that myself.

I think it's going to be different in every situation though"
"Personally, I'm lucky to have a boss who's extremely understanding and supportive"
"He's a good guy, but I also foster it by trying to communicate really directly and openly"
"The other big thing though is that I realize I probably cause him headaches sometimes and try to make up for it.

I mostly work from home and often struggle to stay focused and productive throughout my day"
"To make up for that, I'm usually the one that volunteers myself to work overtime in an evening or on a weekend if there's an emergency deadline for a client"
I try to cure more headaches than I cause
"On the same token, some weeks I struggle to get to 40 billable hours, so on the other weeks, I work extra to balance it out."
"You got this, homie! It's harder for us, it's not fair, but don't let it make you feel bad about yourself"
You wouldn't call a runner with bursitis lazy for not finishing first place.
"We have documents but it was as we were talking about it I was curious what they decided to do.

Teams messenger hasn't been great to convey tone"
My colleagues are very literal.
Another reason why it’s exhausting to be ADHD: we have to manage our memory instead of our memory existing to help us
Sure thing! And I’m sorry your job is being so unaccommodating for you
It doesn’t take a whole lot of effort to print off a document listing which things have fines and which don’t
But I guess their thought process is that it doesn’t take a lot of effort to write it down? Idk
But I wish you the best!
Also happy cake day!
"I hope note-taking (or getting a printed guideline/etc from them) helps! Like it’s understandable they want you to be independent, but why be so rude over a simple question? Just keep doing your best to learn!"
"yes this! I tell my boss/coworkers all the time ""I'm a lot more productive if you give me a minute to write down what you need from me"
"I know it can take a minute for me to jot it down, but it's important to make sure you don't get pushed to the side"""
"It also helps with paying attention during the conversation! I zone out much less when I take notes

It does take extra brainpower and energy, unfortunately, but I sort of treat that as the cost of doing business (or at least, being successful in business) with ADHD"
You've gotta train yourself
It is SO hard with ADHD
"But on some level you gotta just practice, practice, practice and force yourself to do it."
"So, some of the science behind that is when you're learning something new, adding a physical component to it activates your limbic system, which is responsible for those higher level functions like memory"
"Writing something down not only gives you something physical to refer back to, it actually helps make the neural connections in the brain."
"That is a beautiful attitude!

I've had to create my own operational manual in three different jobs because it apparently either never occurred to the previous people who had my roles to do so *or* because they were (tbh understandably) spiteful and deleted all traces of their How-To's.

Write it all down, Heck, even typing it out will help in remembering.

I'd say, go to this guy, apologize for having to ask the same question again and say that you're ""implementing a new strategy and creating an operations manual and schedule regarding these fines and all other aspects of your position""

Unless, it already exists somewhere, then you're RE-WRITING for clearer understanding and easier reference.

PS Happy Cake Day"
"I never heard of that before, why the fuck is it 600 dollars!? It's not nearly as advanced as a cheap phone...  I use an app on mine to keep notes organized."
"I'm freshly diagnosed after years of masking so this is like learung how to human all over again.

I want to be an advocate for myself"
Recaps will be handy we have super dense info to deal with
Just being honest
People sharing with me is really inspiring
Baller
Tha ks for the hitlist
Ima fish and I will climb that tree!
Oh..
so it is!
My willingness to try is..
spotty
"No, sorry.."
lazy
I've been lazy
"The struggle has been to try not fall into masking and hyperfocus every day.

But these answers have been great.

Tough but fair."
Fair
True
Gonna have to do it now
My cake thanks you
"Yeah, it’s because they’re super niche and the competition allows for it"
I invested in an alpha freewrite for my work documentation and it cost me like 400 bucks
"I still use it thankfully, but the device is less advanced than most cheap phones"
They tend to promote these products to people who have ADHD and want minimal distractions.
This oddly secretive squirrel shares great wisdom
"Yeah, i get that, but what i'm trying to say is that calling yourself lazy won't help like everyone else says"
It's not that you don't want to do it
Your brain is basically fighting you on a daily basis.
"I agree with others that calling yourself lazy isn't helpful -- even tho most of us have that running negative self-talk in our heads, especially if you've been unaware / masking for a very long time"
"It can be something we internalise from others, like our parents, teachers, etc etc, & when we think, ""Why can't I do this shit like everyone else?"" And yeah, people without ADHD who don't do XYZ things might be lazy, & sometimes you might be actually lazy too, but try to remember that it's not always that"
What non-ADHD people *don't* generally struggle with as much is like ..
"task paralysis, terrible working memory, etc etc, but we do"
"Try to be honest with yourself, & kind"
"Even if you really are just being lazy sometimes, it still doesn't help to berate yourself about it.

What we have to do is make that extra effort a lot of the time, & to put systems in place that might seem weird or whatever, but will help you in whatever way, like taking notes even for ""simple"" stuff.

Here's another helpful comment by the original commenter:

https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/s/3aTu0lPPWD

Try to communicate openly with your coworkers & boss etc"
Show them that you're working hard to put things in place that will help you; I think that's worth a lot
"""I'm working on this because I know it's an important part of my job.""

It's tough starting a new job! Congratulations on getting it -- cos they obviously thought you'd be great at it"
"Everything is overwhelming right now & this will exacerbate your ADHD stuff & maybe make you extra tired & all that, which also adds to it"
"But you're gonna get so much better at this! You can do this! Take extra good care of yourself -- eating, sleep hygiene (look it up), speaking kindly to yourself, like you would to Little Kid You"
"As long as you're doing your best, well that's the best you can do, you know"
"Be patient with yourself, & open with others"
"You've got this!

🐨💚"
"I'll die on the ""laziness isn't real"" hill"
"There's a REASON something is so hard for you to do, and it's not for lack of caring."
"And I definitely don't want to come off unsympathetic! I had a boss once who would do this to me repeatedly, and she wouldn't give me proper time to document anything"
It was terrible - ultimately I found another job because it was just too much!
They store their wisdom very well
"I'm happy to be responsible, but I'm not being harsh on myself"
Points taken
Words hugs received
"I care enough to be upset but not enough to act.

Been very revealing"
Ah man sorry that happened
I'm loving the straight talking
"No worries, mate"
"You've come to the right place for kindness, empathy, practical tips, & even humour! I'm grateful to've found this sub, & happy you're here too; I've learned so much, & I feel seen & understood.

*hugs*

Happy Cake Day! 🥳"
"That's executive dysfunction though!

I am all for trying harder"
But we don't need to beat ourselves up in the process.
"I'm newly diagnosed so it's very new.

I'm learning between ""I've to try harder"" and ""this is my limit"""
"If you are in therapy, I definitely recommend talking with your therapist about your ""comfort zone"", ""growth zone"", and ""limits/boundaries"""
It's something I have been working on and it's SUPER helpful
"For example, my husband is a bit of a social butterfly, where I am very much an introvert, and get overwhelmed when my schedule is too full"
"My therapist encouraged me to basically go out and do something social Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, and document and journal how I am feeling after each event"
"It really helped me uncover what my ""limit"" there is, and what happens when I reach it"
"Sometimes, that limit is exactly where I expect it to be - but sometimes, I have room for growth (or even sometimes find out I am pushing myself TOO hard)."
I've had something similar
"How do you hold a butterfly

""The butterfly grip""

Not too tight, not too lax but enough to be nurturing and protective at the same time."

Soundcore Life P3i
I absolutely loved them when I got them as a gift over a year ago
"Newer models have since come out and so they’re now $35! They have noise canceling and decent audio quality, and hold a long charge"
I loved the features and still do even with high end headphones.
Moondrop space travel
25 bucks
"Active noise canceling, pass through, and a bt 5.3 low latency mode"
Plus they actually sound good and are super comfortable.
Bunch of JBL options for under that price 👍🏼 best decent cheap headphones I’ve had over many years and great customer service too
"While not in your budget, I think AirPods work with “Find My”"
"If it prevented you from losing your earbuds, you’d be saving money in the long term."
Jlab makes a good earbud
Only around $25
I've washed 3 pairs
honestly the ONN knockoff airpods from walmart are really good
They cost me $20 and I used them for 2 years
"I think they have more advanced earbuds that are meant for activity/sound cancellation for pretty cheap too.

  
JLAB also has good stuff."
"I have a pair from Xiaomi I bought for 50€, it’s been 2 years and they’re still fine"
I rarely use my original AirPods because of them.
"Do they have to ne buds? Over ear, one piece headphones are much harder to lose"
I use over ear for everything except for when I'm wearing a helmet.
Advice check your medical insurance rewards system last year I redeemed
Got myself some jlab Bluetooth earbuds and JBL Bluetooth headphones.
"I love my jlab go pop+! They are pretty good price and last forever, and the charge cord is actually attached to the case so you never have to worry about losing it"
They have some good colors too
I got these ones for cheap from Amazon and they were pretty good
The battery lasted for aaaggeees (never charged them until I lost them lol)
"But, they don’t have a lid which might not be ideal"
"

Reddit won’t let me comment Amazon link so they are called “JLab Go Air Wireless Earphones, Black”"
[Nothing](https://us.nothing.tech/pages/audio) seems nearly ideal for what you’re describing if you can stretch your budget a bit
"The Ear(a) have 42.5 hours of listening time, adaptive ANC, low-lag mode for gaming, great noise quality (from what I’ve heard), and they look awesome"
They’re currently on sale for $69.
"I got these a few weeks ago (I have the same amazing ability of losing headphones as you)

Honestly, I can't recommend them enough, I'm a bit of an audio snob, and these sound great"
"For the price, they are INSANE

"I have a set of [Mpow Flame](https://www.xmpow.com/en-ca/products/mpow-flame-pl02-sports-earphones?srsltid=AfmBOord_e-EqDa0gMzPOTc83zL9O4poxMKvpXHnTzauTlmf7zOofsep) headphones that I bought years ago for like $30 that are still great.

I use them mostly for my TV now, but they still have fantastic battery life."
moondrop space travel are like 20$ and amazing for the price
Love the $30 JLab headphones they have at Walgreens
"They are cheap, comfortable, sound pretty good, and since Walgreens are everywhere it's easy for me to pick up a replacement pair"
Although I have been on my current pair for almost a year now (little wins)
I have skullcandy push active ones ($60) and really love them for comfort (wraps around ear) and battery life.
For me (I also lose shit constantly) what works is sticking/attaching tiles to everything.
"tile is like an airtag but it works with Android, I think they're like $20 on whamazon"
Buy large good quality over ear Bluetooth headphones - less likely to get lost
I was the same as you.
"Hey fellow earbud user! 

The current gen of AirPod pros supports the “Find My” with precision locating"
It will find the case and individual AirPods
"

I go one step further and have them in a case with an AirTag, the new AirTags coming out in the future will have better tracking features.

I’ve only gone through 1 set of AirPods in the last four years, due to me abusing them and dropping them over and over again"
"But I haven’t lost them yet, and I leave my stuff everywhere"
I have custom notifications and alerts setup for when Find My goes off so I can go back and get my things if I forget.
Skullcandy makes affordable and good quality earbuds.
I've used the Anker Soundcore P30i as backups and they are surprisingly good for $49.99 earbuds
"

And damn, they are on a bf deal for $25 on Amazon"
"

Their A25i is good too, they are usually $29.99."
"I just 20 quid ones from Amazon, I've never had a good pair so I can't compare, but they sound perfectly good for me for a little bit of music and podcasts while I'm walking"
"I lose one, or the tip, every few months it doesn't matter as much, they'd never buy an expensive pair!"
TOZO are amazing same with JLab
Truthear gate
Soundcore liberty PRO 3 what I've been using little more than a year
Battery life is the best I've ever seen in earbuds
Can wear the buds for hours and still have plenty of life and case can go weeks between charges
But they're $80 on Amazon currently. 
Try stockholm earbuds
I forgot what model I have but I bought them years ago
They look like the apple earbuds that came out before the airpod so they're super comfy if you're like me and have small ears.
skullcandy rails bave tracking even in the case
i bought them specifically to be loss proof lol
I mean I wouldn’t say they’re ‘the best’ quality ones but I just get them from Staples

"Any noise cancelation I can buy within like 30bucks? And no ear phones, unfortunately new phones don't have ear phones pin slot"
So bummed about it
Oppo 11 has lasted me 4 years
 Cheap and still going strong
same
"and i used wired ones, the radition emf from wireless is not good for your brain"
I started buying from temu
Just get some 10€ ones from aliexpress or temu
I have had other  soundcore products and they have all been great for the price.
Approve this
"Got the P20i, and I'm happy"
Think I paid 16€
Agreed
"Came here to point them towards Anker earbuds, I've been extremely satisfied.

I have since upgraded, but keep my Soundcores as a backup."
"I’ve had my Soundcore Life P3 for over three years now and they’re still going strong! They were $70-80 at the time, but absolutely worth it"
The case is small enough to be easy to carry but big enough to not disappear into the void
10/10 would recommend.
Sounds amazing! It seems like I would have to wait a couple days for the delivery
I’ll order it while I still have a pair of earphones so I can use them rightaway when I need a new one haha
I bought these a few weeks ago and they are great
 Unfortunately I lost them already #oops
Another vote for the Moondrop Space Travel! I even love the little anime voice that says “connected!” Every time I use them.
Thank you!!
Unfortunately mine went under within just a year
It was darn expensive one at that too.
Unfortunately mine went under within just a year

It works really well until you (1) leave one or both somewhere really far away and/or (2) they run out of battery before you find them or (3) put them in the laundry..
 This is why I can't have nice things...
Appreciate taking time for giving me suggestions tho!
"lol i’ve lost 2 pairs of my airpods pro and currently i only have the left earphone because I lost the right in but they’ll the only ones i’ll use because of the amazing noise cancelling in a small form factors.

Find my saved my ass a couple times but once they die it’s game over"
I’ve just bought it Thank you!
I like the fact that it sells in Walmart! I can pick it up in a day
I bought Jlab this time but I’ll try this someday!
Oh yeah I think Xiaomi would be a good choice as well
Thank you!
"same, bought them cos they re cheap - 20 quids i think - and i liked the color lol"
"i've had it for a few months now, sometimes the sound isnt v good on calls etc but quite good overall"
I havent even read this comments before buying it but I apparently I just bought that! thank you!!
"Oh that’s perfect for me
I got Go pop+ for this time, I’ll try Go Air for the next time!"
"Eh, I have the ear 1, and wasn't a huge fan"
Was full of bugs and one thing is permanently quieter than the other for some reason
"Thanks a lot for the comments! But I worried that I might end up losing it in a short bit and not be able to make the money worth it 😢😅
I’ve lost two laptop mouses in the last three months haha"
I'm not sure I can find this in the US… Thank you for the recommendation!
"This looks good, especially for running! Thanks a lot!"
Please do not do this
Wireless technology needs to be regulated because it can impact your health.
There ya go lol
I am an audio guy on a budget… i was impressed by them
I showed them to on of my music and audio inclined friends and after he listened to then and i told him they were 25 bucks he was blown away lol
"

There are obviously going to not sound as good as a 150 set of earbuds but for the price they are very nice.

I have ordered two different sets on amazon and both came in 2 days so hopefully your ship time isnt too bad"
Lmao i love that
And the way it cycles modes “ssshhh” “Hey!”… ha
"Mine have all lasted well, if they’re dying under a year you need to get onto them as that would still be under manufacturers warranty"
Had various ear buds from them and lasted well
Hahaha that’s fair
"I think you get some prorated replacement if you have them under Apple Care, but that still probably wouldn’t be as cheap as multiple cheap pairs."
Yea I’ve used two AirPods before but Im never good at charging and find my didn’t show the specific location… Like I know It is in my room but I dont know where situation goes on for weeks for me 🥲
"If you download the jlab app too, here's more features"
"I Love them , can't beat the price either."
You are welcome
"I definetly understand misplacing your earbuds lol but jsyk, the Ear(a) does have Find My built into it"
I'm not sure how good it is but that's what the website states
"I also forgot to mention that there is an option within your budget, the [CMF Buds Pro 2](https://us.nothing.tech/products/cmf-buds-pro-2?variant=45068151783576) are $47 right now."
"Well, not exactly under year"
"It's like 1.2 so warranty expired and they suggested could rather buy new ones, repair gonna be expensive."
The newer models can play a sound to find them like an Apple Watch or AirTag
I have AirPod pro 2 and they do that
I think the new AirPod 4 model does as well
Gutted
Classic curse of all my devices (especially apple) which always seem to fry out juuuuuusssttt after the warranty dips 🤔
You can make each individual earbud ring too if you lose one

Let your doctor know this
It can be dehydration it can be something serious
Healthcare professional should advise.
I use to get headaches for the first month(?) of meds
I would take ibuprofen or Tylenol for it
It helped
Make sure you are eating and hydrating properly during the day
A lack of one and/or both will exacerbate a headache

Also, if you are use to drinking caffeine make sure you aren’t going cold turkey on it"
Caffeine withdrawal migraines are a b*tch.

I ate and it helped..

You go to a psychiatrist and tell them how you feel and what you think you got
Make an appointment with your PCP or a psychiatrist
"You tell the what you’re struggling with, how you feel, answer their questions and listen to their recommendation"
"They may ask for some testing or diagnostics, they may prescribe medication to try"
Then you follow up with them every few weeks to adjust as necessary

IR really helped me with my workouts but not so much with XR
Which are you taking?
I'm taking 10mg IR twice a day right now.
It might be related to your timing
I used to time my workouts and doses so they’d coincide
I wanted to workout while my adderall was peaking
And when it did they were the best workouts I’ve ever had
If you workout around the decline and crash then that might be your problem.

I'm a lawyer so I felt this in my soul
"Always hated timesheets, meds make them slightly more bareable but I still hate tracking every hour of my day."
"its all a lie, keep it up"
"

i dont do my timesheet ACCURATELY  because the portal logs you out after 10 minutes of inactivity , all the tickets, tasks, incidents, requests....time cards....all of its int he portal and CONSTANTLY logging you out"
"

so just put admin, infra management, and automation in blocks and copy it each week"
if i submit it on time i never hear a PEEP.
Edited: Companies hire people to do work
They’re willing to pay a certain amount annually for that and people are willing to work that much for a certain amount of money
"Once that has been determined, the company should just pay that amount and expect the work to get done"
"What does it matter how short or long it takes? Like, if someone is working way too much, there need to be conversations about efficiency (on the person’s part) and workload (on the company’s part)"
"But if I do your work in 30 hours a week instead of 40, why do you care?"
"By chance, are you a software engineer? I worked for a startup that had time sheets, my boss was less on the “get 40 hours in a week” and more on the “get your work done however you need to get it done”.

Also, imposter syndrome will fuck you up"
"Remember that non-adhd folks do not consistently churn out work like a productivity machine, they also fib on their time sheets a bit"
"Depending on your work culture, you may be heavily overthinking it."
I used to work for a defense contractor and had to do this
I would have the same issue with no work for days and then massive amounts of work in short bursts that matched the output of others that worked more consistently
I hated it with a passion and this is one of the reasons I don't work for places that require timesheets anymore.
"Hey man, in a similar boat using time sheets.

One thing I did was start to include my ""ADHD time tax"" in my hours and give myself a more fluid calendar (and reasonable goals) by doubling my estimates on my calendar"
"

Basically, I'll estimate 1 hr of work, convert it to 2 hrs for ADHD tax, and that's what I quote for my work"
"

Realistically, if I could just go into hyperfocus overdrive I'd probably do it in less than an hour (which is what my brain tries to estimate it on)"
"But I know if I have a bad day, I might spend more time muscling through it"
"Usually, between shifty focus and mental resistance I end up averaging out to about right in my time"
"

And when it comes to actually writing it down, I have my boundaries"
Anything beyond my 2 hour estimate is time I am willing to eat so I have motivation to keep trying to do better with my time management
"Anything less than 2 hrs is 100% billable.

Companies while try and distill time estimates down to the most strict and tightly productive definition"
Humans simply don't work that way which is why everyone hates time sheets
They just don't make sense
Things happen that cause work items to take more time and cognitive fatigue is one of those things
So try to frame your time less like 100% productivity and more like 50%
"If it doesn't work at first, play with it a bit to see if you can find a happy medium.

Hope this helps, best of luck!"
Just lie the way your manager needs you to lie
"Timesheets are ""necessary"" to figure out the blend of capitalized vs non-cap work for taxation"
The fact is that companies just want a convincing chain of evidence that groups are working at the desired ratio so they can do their accounting
As long as you get your entries close enough to the expectation you'll be fine
It's a silly dance everyone does to make the system work.
I just got swapped from salary to hourly and you'd think I'd been given double the workload the way it feels to my ADHD brain
I now hate my job 100 times more than I did when I was salary
It's awful.
"This is exactly why I am very explicit in the interview process.

"" I am not a butt in seat kinda guy, if you are looking for a 9-5 dude, you are wasting our time"" - a line said during an interview with a VP"
"Got hired.

I get 40 hours of work done In 8"
"But I don't get to choose the 8.

I am very picky about who I work for and the work I do"
"Because of this exact thing.

My current role literally has me and an exception to the ""clock all your billable time"" rule"
Customer pay for my time by the year
I literally am the product.
I learned a lot about this when I was in a coding bootcamp - that a software engineers’ billable time INCLUDES the downtime that it sometimes requires
"

Like, if our brain is stuck on a problem, we sometimes have to get up and walk away, or take our mind completely off the subject to get some clarity"
No software engineer is actively coding 100% of their day
Not one - not even non-ADHD people
"

It feels so antithetical to everything we have been taught our whole lives (i.e"
"you’re always needing to “stay busy,” or at least, “look busy,” lol)"
But it’s a truth that not a lot of people talk about
"This is also where I learned that there are stretches of time where us ADHD-ers, especially, are less productive than our peers, and there are days when we are more productive"
"

I’m currently a software tester, and there are days where I’ve been busy with myriad things (thanks, bouncing ADHD brain), but I have almost no measurable “output;” then there are other days where I file 15 or more bugs in 4 hours, for example, and have multiple productive discussions in Slack about things that seem obvious to me, but no one else has thought of before"
"That’s, like, days worth of output sometimes all in one day"
"For context, my average time to file a bug (verifying it, collecting documentation, filing it, and noting it on any test cases) is around half an hour"
"

I had a discussion with my boss when I first started that I will log my required hours per day, but it’s not gonna fit the actual time I’m at my desk"
"I told him that if I clocked in and out every time I walked away from my desk, it was going to be an absolute mess of a time sheet, AND I would forget to clock out or in and be constantly bugging him to fix it"
He said a messy time sheet isn’t a big deal
"I told him that would be a nightmare for both of us, and I would keep track of my own time with an in-browser time tracker to make sure I was meeting my hourly goals for each day"
"He agreed but it took me being assertive about it because I also don’t want that extra stress! 

He told me he honestly doesn’t care when I work as long as I’m at the required meetings, I answer my messages in Slack and Asana in a timely manner (usually same day), and get all my assigned work done"
"Thankfully, we are Agile and work in 2-week Sprints, so I have a lot of flexibility when it comes to fitting in my work.

I use a LOT of alarms"
⏰ Alarms are literally the only thing helping me navigate the confusing seas of time!
"unfortunately the only solution is to lie, especially if you work somewhere that the timesheets actually impact how much $$ clients are billed"
it's a completely bullshit system but it's the world we live in.
Only time I like them is when I can just scan a badge and even then it’s so lame
"

I remember working in a hospital where if you had 5 tardies then you were automatically fired"
You also had to badge in at your department
But they put employee parking on the top level of a parking garage with the first 3 floors being all patient parking and patient drop off
"

So you get to work 10-15 minutes early, there would be a line of people waiting to park, and then you’d have to wait for patient families unfairly have to figure out how and where to park while a ton of employees are trying not to get fired"
"

So instead they’d have a ton of workers all stopping by one of the side entrance non-emergency patient drop off zones"
Leaving their car running as they sprinted inside to use the first available badge machine to clock in so they could go wait 10-15 minutes to park
"

And admin was ruthless"
I remember a nurse going through the death of her mother and having to care for her sick infant crying because she was at strike 4 for being late and she wasn’t sure how she was going to survive another month
"

Then on top of that! 

Finished with work? Well, gotta get your boss to check in with admin to see if you can go home early or use PTO"
Because forbid you go home early with nothing else to do because if you’re under 40 hours of work that week it could end your full time benefit coverage
"

So not a whole department just waiting around at the end of a day for an hour, punished for being efficient, so we can badge out at exactly 3:55pm."
Time to lie! ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
No one tells the truth on timesheets
Even the most well organised.
I always ignore my timesheet and fill everything out literally an hour before my company tells us to submit them
And I work support for a company that sells HR/Time solutions including timesheets lol
"Probably nobody cares, they just want you to submit the timesheet for auditing purposes."
Just lie
"

As long as you get your work done it's all good"
"It's a job, they're not your friends or family"
"
Do not feel bad for doing the work they pay you for"
You are not morally obligated to give them anything more than the bare minimum
(Does not apply to healthcare or similar work of course)
"Oh, my gods, can I relate!

I'm a designer for an engineering consultant"
Billable hours will be the death of me! I work on the same pattern as you
I've basically just accepted that my timesheets will mostly be fiction.
I hate it too
"

Who do you bill for the time it takes to do your timesheets?"
I feel you
" I did this for 15 years, been out of it for 6 now and I don't think I could go back."
I'm a technician and charge different customers depending on when I leave office to when I get back to the office
"Using Google maps ""timeline"" to show exactly when I leave and arrive from one place to another has been an absolute life saver."
Yep
Timesheets are awful
I had to do this per client in public accounting but my billing rate was too high
They would bill clients based on time spent and i would always have write offs
It was so stupid
I also worked way more hours than i put in and would get in trouble
I’m terrible at all levels and totally different job types
Works done pay me
When in doubt always undersell the hours worked like I have a guilty conscience.
We are the same person.
"its not nearly the same, i work in a bar but also have to fill in timesheets"
i just lie
yesterday i got out of work at 11:23pm when i was supposed to finish at 11pm
i just put down 12am as my finish time and now they gotta pay me for it
most places genuinely just don’t check or have any way of knowing
I feel your pain
 Fortunately I don't have to do them anymore
 They are pain especially when you are working on multiple projects it is very hard to keep track on what time you have spent on each one
 Latterly what I did was look at the proportion of e-mails I'd sent on each project that week and divide the time up accordingly.
My company uses two ways to keep time and I hate it
Why two?? I always forget to submit on time.
Luckily I got a job that needs me to clock in and out
"And I’m only human, I can be 0-15 minutes under/over"
And my boss haven’t said anything yet
I feel the pain.
 coming from someone who was in public accounting and had to track their time in 6 minute intervals.
I switched to public sector engineering
I put 80 hours on my timesheet once every 2 weeks and then don’t have to think about it again.
"Yo, this fr"
"I currently work as on-site IT support, and I'll say that most of the standard employees in this building have a swipe-in system, where it automatically records your time when you swipe"
"THAT I would be fine with, because it's like muscle memory after a point whenever you enter or leave the building"
"But no, the IT team is required to physically log into the company site, and manually input our hours for the day/ week, every pay period"
"Naturally, I frequently forget to do this, and I'd guess that in the past 3+ years at this company, my boss has spoken to me at least 30 times about not inputting my hours"
So fucking frustrating in so many ways.
"I have a personal timesheet I’d started long ago to ensure I get 40 hrs and know if I’m over, manage Flex Time if I work over etc.

I use that still but when I log my time for work I usually still make it avg to 8 hr a day +- 1 hr or so on occasion"
"

Manager is ok with this and I still plug it into the type of time to be accurate on reports (ie project hours vs non-project) but my personal one is where the Flex Time shenanigans are documented lol"
" Our department is pretty flexible as well, and work is constantly in flux.

I also hate it, but started doing personal one for the privilege of Flex Time without running on “vibes” lol"
I feel otherwise I’d end up overworking on flex or something.
"I feel incredibly fortunate to have a job that doesn't do time sheets, and we have a flexi time system where I can put in more hours when things are really busy, track them on my own, and compensate during calmer periods with less pressure by taking shorter days or entire days off"
Very trust based system but it's the one I actually thrive in really well
"Sometimes someone is found to be taking advantage of that trust, but they're told off when they get found out, and they either course correct or leave."
"Back when I had to do these I would make a template for an “average” week and copy, paste, and make minor adjustments to the template with no issues."
"They are bad for me because I get shit done fast and I get it done good.

So I literally slowed down"
It sucked
My minimum is 45 per week
Only because of gf I stopped doing over time
I had OT hours every week since May
"I don't care about waking up anymore edit: I'm late almost every week on time sheets, the payroll lady is always calling me about it.."
I guess I'll add more edits when I remember edit2: the weeks that I'm depressed and don't make my 45 I just send it with whatever it's got or work weekend to catch up
I ran into this same problem when I did public accounting
Was a constant issue
Omfg this is my bane
I train dogs
"I teach lessons and I get hired to work a dog for ""board and trains"" wherein the dog stays at our facility and we do homework in practical environments like parks, trails, urban city areas etc"
It's a dream job that I didn't know was a dream job
"I've become pretty good at it and, I get great reviews and the reason I think I've stayed with it this long is because I love it"
Never had a job that I could say that about before this one
"There are a lot of things I dislike about it, I'd basically dislike everything that isn't actually going out and working with the dog/client"
"This includes cleaning poop, cleaning kennels, writing up client info sheets/contracts and of course Time Sheets.

It's fucking infuriating"
"I won't skip doing things like cleaning up poop or kennels of course, it has to get done but it takes me extra long and Im not on the clock for it (I'm paid a commission amount for the sale and I'm only reimbursed for my time in lessons or working the dogs)"
"We use a digital calender, digital booking app but for reasons relating to my boss being lazy and not wanting to find a spreadsheet app or something similar, we use paper timesheets.

Im always forgetting to write my stuff in daily, i track my time on my phone and usually write it all down at the end of the period"
I'm not the only one that does this
I almost resent paper itself because it's so frustrating.
Thanks for sharing your rant
I also work in engineering consulting and timesheets are a struggle for me too
"I'm always getting the notification ""don't forget to start/fill out your timecard!"" Most of the days im pretty good about jotting down the time I switch tasks/projects in a notebook. 


There's always the internal monologue going on in my head that the client's money is being as I do the task/work and it doesn't help the stress about how efficient I'm doing something.  "
I’m an accountant
I will never accept another job where I have to do timesheets
I would rather light myself on fire.
I used to work in IT
We had to do timesheets & I loathed it
"Like you, there were times I’d be super-busy, other times not"
"Plus I could never remember exactly what I’d been doing.  I reckon I spent a couple of hours every week running back through my email, calendar etc., to establish what I’d been working on & when"
I’d list that on the timesheet too
No one ever commented. 
I always just did a rough estimation of percentage of time I worked on each project times 40 hours.
"Just keep track of the stuff you do, like in an Excel spreadsheet or something, then use that, plus sent email, submitted documents , meetings in calendar, etc"
"to assign stuff to appropriate days.

If you have a sent email, that task needs time on it on that day, But you can put most of the hours for it on a distracted Friday before & a half an hour on the day you sent the email.

Another alternative is to, on a daily basis, put in the hours in the morning for the stuff you *should* work on, and keep track somewhere else of what you actually do, and then your principal task is to make sure the hours work out ok."
I know what you are going through from personal experience (thankfully I don't have to do this anymore!)
I just average it all out
"The people reading the timesheet won't know any better (and as a manager myself now, most of us don't even really look that closely - we're more focused on just making sure the numbers are in the right ballpark)."
I thought I was in the other adhd / programmers sub lol 😆 I absolutely HATE filing timesheets and worklogs
I can work on a single ticket for a whole day but I think they expect us to be flexible and handle multiple tickets.
but it takes me several hours (or never) for me to gain momentum to work on the next task so I feel like an impostor everytime I try to pretend on the worklog that I'm working on multiple tickets.
🫠
It sounds like your system works for you and your work output
"If you need to lie on the time sheet, lie away."
"Are you medicated?

Because the problem isn't really the timesheets"
It's the inconsistency
"

I know it's not on purpose - but you're making this problem yourself.

Do you have regular meetings? Status updates? It doesn't sound like you do"
Which is odd - to me - for billable work
Outside of timesheets I still had to give my current status to the rest of the team or a project manager
"That is what really kept me on task.

I would really try and work towards a traditional work week"
It will make your life better.
I’m impressed! I had to quit civil defense bc billing made me too depressed haha
"I typically do mine in the 15 mins before they’re due the following Monday 🙃

I have always struggled with admin type work"
Praying for the day I have an AI assistant.
"Same, I used to have a app for time tracking down to every 30minutes but got exhausted"
Now I just sit down at the end of the week and remember what I did and write it down
Don't remember? Fck it
Lump it together with the hours I do remember what I did
As long as it's contract and not billable nobody ever gave af Edit:typo
"Actually, I wouldn't do that"
"I remember years ago, before I started working on my ADHD and bipolar I, I would waste a lot of time surfing"
"At the end of the week--actually more like the next Monday because I pretty much always turned in my time late, even with bosses hounding me--I would not be able to accurately report what exactly i worked on"
"I posted A LOT OF TIME to admin, 3-4-6 hours worth"
"The higher ups didn't like that.

Instead, how about getting with your boss and discussing the following:
* You have ADHD, and because of it, your most productive hours are not exactly between 9 to 5;
* Dicuss your working different hours, say afternoon hours, for a full 8 hours.

It might just work in your favor."
Because if you can get your work done in 30 hours they expect 10 more hours and 33% more productivity from you for free.
My company wants engineers to be 80% billable each week
So 32 of my hours need to be documented on my time ticket towards specific projects
They have to be documented that way so they can bill each project for the labor hours used
"

It's annoying and I feel the same as OP"
Some weeks I'm so unproductive but I HAVE to be consistently productive
" And sometimes I end up working nights or weekends because I procrastinated and a project has to get done by the day I promised.

It's hell in construction because there are no clear timelines"
Just everything is needed as soon as possible
I need clear deadlines to organize myself
And self-imposed deadlines are hard for me to keep..
This is 100% dependent on your job
"For most senior jobs, part of your job is to come up with your own goals and ideas"
"It is expected that if you have free time, that free time will be used to generate new ways for the company to be more efficient and/or make more money.

So, the hyper focused work bursts followed by long breaks are out of reach for non-ADHD people who think that we should be hyper focused for 8 hours a day."
"Best response & I’ll add that your hours probably still average out to 40/wk considering you may do 20 one week, 40 the next, 60 the wk after, etc"
I think it’s virtually impossible for time tracking to be objectively accurate.
Get
Me
"Out.

God forbid, you clock 39.9 hours by mistake, or you charge the wrong program.

I stay because I barely do actual work, and it allows me to support my family while going to college"
I'm out of this hell hole as soon as I graduate.
Thanks for the accounting insight
The silly dance is so tiring though. 
I feel the same
"Went to freelancing, made a rookie mistake to charge hourly not per project"
"
The 15min screen capture is parallizing"
I feel this so hard
This!
"I am a big fan of ""constructive downtime"""
"I am a big car guy, and even the latest, greatest, most expensive, high tech cars that could set world record lap times at the most challenging race tracks around the world need time to cool off, literally"
"I know companies would love if were machines, but even machines need down time."
"That's so stressful! I worked at a place once with the ""tardy strike system"" and I was terrified and always rushing out the door"
I'm glad my current place is a bit more forgiving and flexible. 
This! This is the definition of a self referencing function and then my brain breaks.
I put in admin time for filling out my timesheet and my boss lost his shit
 I was told it needs to be divided up according to how much time I spent on each project...
Same here! Google maps timeline has come in clutch so many times when I need to back track what I did during the week. 
"Been there, done that, bought the poster."
"Ugh I hate the managerial idea that the managers ""own"" all 40 hours of my time"
"I'm in my 3rd year of an engineering job and it drives me nuts the number of conversations I've had that go like:

""The test environment is ready to run, when do you want to run the test?""

*First thing tomorrow.*

""Ah, alright"
"Is there anything else you want me to look at before then?""

*No.*

""Ok cool, so can I head out for the day?""

*No.*"
Yup.
I have to hit 90%
"But when I've got over 4 hours of internal meetings the company put in, not sure how this works."
Yeah as an engineer myself i see this a lot
"A lot of wasted time just because “that’s how it’s always been done”.

Like I know I would be a lot more productive tomorrow if I got to recharge a bit extra today"
"Like in your example, no work can be done until tomorrow so the company loses no money"
The employee being happier and more productive makes the company more money
"Should be a win win right? 

But I guess because they never got that luxury it shouldn’t be provided to anyone else and instead one should just rot at their desk and pretend to look busy"
"

Fuck office work culture."
I'm lucky in that my direct managers are understanding and get that meetings and training happen
"And time off!! And so far in my 10 years at the company, my billable time has never directly impacted my raises."
I feel this every day
The judgement as though I have a poor work ethic when I’ve actually left roles and had to be replaced by 3 people
"
That my role requires actual thought intellect and problem solving which is supposed to happen in the stimulating environment of a shared office and couldn’t possibly happen at 2am, driving the motorway or in the shower"
"
I’ve been sick I’m still maintaining some work tasks, but oh you weren’t at your desk for half an hour."
shuddup..

"Protein shakes(made with whole milk if possible), foods like kefir, avocado, cashews, cheese, smoked salmon and red meat"
You really have to eat even when you don’t feel like it
This will help your medication work better too and lessen side effects
Good luck!
"Hmm, not sure if this is good advice or not but my appetite increases for a period of time after my medication wears out"
"Maybe you're the same and you can take advantage of this? By timing your meals and medication in the right way, you may be extra hungry at the right time when they wear off"
I'm on instant release medication so it may be different if you're on extended release since its harder to time stuff with those because they last longer
Just some food for thought! (pun intended)
"I try to sneak in stuff that’s calorie-dense, usually stuff with a lot of fat"
"Like peanut butter, it’s generally pretty palatable even if I have no appetite and is quite high-calorie"
"And anything drinkable is usually more palatable for me when I don’t want to eat - protein shake, smoothie, yogurt, stuff like that"
"The bonus with that too is if you make it yourself it’s really easy to make it high in fat and protein.

I’ve kind of dealt with this from two different sides at this point"
First it was depression and alcohol abuse completely getting rid of my appetite (despite being constantly hungry no matter how much I ate)
"Now, my meds don’t kill my appetite, but they make me stop compulsively over-eating from boredom, and since they also allow me to enjoy things again I fall into a habit of intentionally not eating for the euphoria of it"
So for me the biggest challenge is putting my foot down and telling myself I HAVE to eat whether I want to or not
You might just have to set reminders on your phone or make a schedule for making yourself eat something
"I usually can convince myself to by deciding I can stop eating after any amount, I just have to try to eat something."
Being active really helped me
Things like the gym and running seem counterintuitive but it brings on an appetite
I still have off days where my body rather not eat but progress isn’t gonna happen all at once
Liquid calories are a lifesaver
Also sitting down with a friend or family member for a snack often really helps.
"First of all, I'm sorry you're getting downvoted"
"Second, try weight gain drinks like ""Optimum Nutrition Serious Mass, Weight Gainer Protein Powder"" or ""GNC Pro Performance Weight Gainer Protein Powder"" Use these as protein shakes or make smoothies out of them, you can really pack some calories by adding banana, peanut butter, whole fat milk, etc"
"Try incorporating more high fat foots into your diet like cashews & other nuts (and nut butters), avocado, dried fruit, olive oil into your cooking, etc"
If you only like 1 meal a day or a couple of small meals try to make them really nutrient and calorie dense
Maybe you can have a big breakfast that you take your medication with? Or exercise may stimulate your appetite (although be careful since that could lead to more weight loss)
Good luck!
"I don’t know why I’m getting downvoted, I’m starting to believe that this subreddit is not accepting to newcomers."
I had a lengthy conversation with my doctor about weight loss when I started my medication because that was a big concern of mine
"I’m 6 foot and only 135 pounds, I’ve been hitting the gym for over a year now, toned out a lot, and originally weighed 120"
So I definitely didn’t wanna lose the little weight I gained
"

Routine is very important when maintaining weight"
"Since you’re already on your medication, you can start off with smaller things that are high in nutrients"
Just make sure you are getting your 3 meals a day and it’ll start to become a habit
You can try to gradually increase your servings as you see fit
"

You could also try to start your routine when you take a break from your meds like on the weekend or something"
That could make things easier.
"I don’t know if this applies to you, but I tend to get pretty hungry when my meds wear off and I have to eat when I take them so I try to eat a good meal in the morning when I take my pill and then in the evening when it’s wearing off"
For me it’s also been med dependent
I’m petite too and I got borderline underweight when on Ritalin but gained back the weight and have stayed pretty consistent on Vyvanse even though Vyvanse doesn’t increase my appetite the way Ritalin did
"Liquid calories are also helpful, smoothies, protein shakes, etc."
"Hey guys, read through a bunch of helpful comments"
"Thank you guys so much for the advice, especially regarding specific foods + routines"
I have fallen behind on holding myself accountable when it comes to eating and setting a routine
Today after making this post I decided to be a bit more proactive
Thank you so much for all the advice :)

I'm scared of stopping my medication

Is there a reason you want to come off of it? (If you aren't comfortable sharing why that's perfectly fine too)
"

As someone new to medication I remember vividly what I was like before"
Lol
"It was hard, but I don't think the meds fix all your problems either"
"Really, it's hard work every day on and off meds"
Meds give you more space to work through those issues but I don't think they fix them if that makes sense
"

But I don't plan on staying on it forever either ( I'll give it a few years, and probably come off of it)"
I'm going to do therapy to learn how to manage my ADHD and other stuff and then slowly come off once I am in a good place
So I get it
"

Also, you should give your partner some credit"
My husband has been living with my undiagnosed ADHD for 5 years
He does a great job to steering me back to the point of conversations and helping me manage my stress and anxiety
"Your partner loves you, and yeah this MIGHT be a big adjustment"
"But I would say, make sure you're in therapy"
Keep lines of communication open with him
Let him know when you're overstimulated
"

If you need to go slower to stop taking it, it's okay"
Just take your time coming off the medication (unless it's something you really need to do now)
"

I promise you will be okay"
"If my dumbass can survive 32 years unmedicated, I promise you can do it"
❤️
"You've been on the medication for this long, why taper off so quickly? Talk to your Dr"
about doing it over a 6 month time-frame
"If you get to a point where your quality of life decreases, stop the taper and stick at that dose"
It's much easier to find your lowest possible dose this way
"

Maybe you'll get down to nothing or maybe not but don't focus on a timeline, focus on your quality of life"
Keep a journal and track how you feel
Take your time
Go slooooowly
"

Perhaps you'd be fine with a fast taper but why take that risk? I don't know anyone who regretted tapering on a slower timeframe"
"

I have allergies and take medication to manage impactful symptoms"
"When I don't take my meds, I am stuffed up and my eyes are red and runny etc"
I won't die without my allergy meds but my quality of life would certainly suffer
I wear glasses because I prefer to see
I've worn glasses since 2nd grade
Just because I've worn them for X number of years does it mean that I must now stop wearing them
Choosing to be legally blind would definitely be against my best interests
Life has enough challenges
I choose to use the tools available to me to improve the quality of my life
I'm worth it
And so are you.
Why do you want to decrease your dose?
"Thank you for your support <3
I'm so grateful for my boyfriend, as he is the absolute best"
"He told me he'll love me no matter what, that he'll help me make things easier for me, for us, and he says he's ready to put up with it"
"I know it is all true, but I think it's just my inner voice that doesn't want me to believe it, trying to convince me that he won't love me once he'll meet my true self"
I try to make it shut up but it's really hard.
The reason is that's what my doctor planned for me
"She told me to contact her if there's anything, and once I'll be done with Strattera I will see her again to talk about how I feel and how we'll continue for Concerta"
I remember she told me that really I got Strattera mostly as an antidepressant back when I was a teenager and maybe something to help me with my anxiety? I'm quite unsure about that part tho
"She has told me in the past 2 years that truly there would be better treatment than strattera as an adult to do those things, so I don't really mind coming off of it faster so I can have something else if I need it.

I will ask her to come off Concerta slower tho, as I really don't need to do it in a short period of time"
"The whole thing was for pregnancy planning, and we are not trying to do it before the end of 2025."
"Oh that inner voice is an asshole.

It always says stuff like that"
It might get hard but you have 9 years under your belt
He can learn how to handle it
It might take some time and patience on both sides but it can work
"My husband hadn't really dated before me, so he had to learn a LOT about women"
"

Your man has a head start at least lol."

I'm really struggling to know how I'm supposed to know/feel that I'm on the right dose.

I'm in the exact same shoes as you
Commenting so this might get some traction/insight.
My psy
"said that ""20mg probably be disapoint "", it is super low and agree"
"50mg felt something but month by month have to rise it by ten.
It wont work if u sleep too little.
Always remember right nutrion and somekind of sport
Water is super important too."
I'm glad to know I'm not the only one having this experience!
Thank you so much
I'm hoping when I go up in mg it will last longer for me and also have a stronger effect if that makes sense?
"yeah it lasts for a while, u know by that to rise it again.
when it dont last like used to be.😊🤗"
What happens if you get to the top dose and it doesn't last as long?
"then u ask ur doctor how much balls she/he got to go over that xdd
my dose is 90mg..."

I haven’t began my thesis because I can’t concentrate
I get ya
"That’s why when you finish a book, you should celebrate

I think you should focus on the quality and not the quantity"
I stopped reading the books I wanted to read because of this
"Now, if I read 10p/day, I’m cool"
Definitely
I haven’t read a full book since 5th grade
I am now 25 years old
I did skim through articles or required readings when I was in school
I can read aloud to a class but I don’t register what I read
When I am alone read things online etc
I re read the same line many times to make sense of what I read
For that reason and because I simply get bored haven’t read a book since
"I’ve bough them and tried, now on medication I’m simply still uninterested"
Its once of goals but I feel discouraged to read actually
You’re not alone and it’s sucks because I feel like I am smart and I love learning
Reading would definitely help with my vocabulary and overall knowledge but I just can’t do it
(Audio books either)
I still find it difficult even on meds-Strattera and Adderall
I may drop Adderall because it hasn't helped - the only reason I tried it
"That said, I do read a lot because it's important to me and a key part of my job"
But it takes a lot longer because I usually need to read things 3 times.
"Have you tried to improve your reading technique?

There are many ways to speed up overall pace of reading while not decreasing comprehension. 

These can really help"
"I used to have to focus on every word, reading in my thoughts/inner voice"
"But since learning new methods - especially useful for text books, I’ve been able to increase stamina and speed.

Still nothing like as fast as my GF (very fast reader comparatively) but a shit load better than a few years ago"
I can read novels
But I struggle to read textbooks
"I think part of that is the demand that comes with reading most textbooks, ie, it must be completed by a certain time"
"Even if it's a subject I'm interested in, I struggle to both read and retain"
What's weird is I can read research journals and studies just fine
And sometimes I will do that if they're cited in the text
"

I've heard a lot of people have success with programs that read the books aloud to you"
I know my college has some access programs that allow for this
"I've never tried it, mostly because I don't like audiobooks, so I can't comment on success."
"It’s really only for fantasy books that I usually enjoy but idk, I go 2 months of reading any book I can and then it all goes away like rn"
Meds help with focus but they don’t give motivation at all
My books are just staring at me..
I’d much rather read it myself
I had this period where I would take my meds and would be so focused on what I’m reading and visualise everything in it
It was very peaceful for my brain so I’m trying to figure out how to do that again
You should look into it
It takes effort to start
But I find it like a hobby in itself and doesn’t take long to train
There is loads of books/aufio/video on the topic - usually “speed reading” but much of them talk about general techniques needed to improve overall comprehension too. 
Thanks!

"For me, I just have to remove as many barriers as possible and stop judging myself for the way I work out.

I'm a pretty casual recreational cyclist – which is to say, I love to ride, but have no interest in racing"
I have a trainer for my bike – a device that turns your bike into a stationary exercise bike
I pretty much only use it during the cold depths of winter though
"The reason is that I always judge myself for using it otherwise because I think ""I should be riding outside, what am I doing?!"" 

The thing is though, riding outside has many more barriers for me"
"I have to check the weather to know what clothes and gear to wear, then I have to find all of that gear and put it on, fill water bottles and snacks, make sure I have my tool and patch kit ready to go, that my phone is charged, pick a route, etc., etc.

For the trainer though, I just have to put my shoes and shorts on, that's it"
"My basement doesn't have weather variability, if my phone dies I can plug it in, and most importantly, I can ride for as little or as much as I want"
And I can watch netflix while I ride
I've started embracing it and it's great!

Sleep is nonexistent

"Unisom, melatonin and Magnesium Citrate (I think that’s the one)

Best sleep of your life"
Something that's helping me recently whenever I wake up in the middle of the night and can't get back to sleep is to get out of bed immediately and stay in another room for 5-10 minutes doing something relaxing/not taxing
Then drink some water and get back to bed
That knocks me out pretty quick
"

Why this works? I don't know, but I'd guess it has something to do with reminding the active brain that it's time to sleep by following the impulse of being awake while doing something relaxing in another room and tiring it out."
Trazodone.
"I can’t take melatonin anymore, every time I do I wake up having nightmares."
what type of relaxing activity do you do?
I’ll have to try it and see how it works for me.
"It's really quite tedious, but I just doodle in the dark for a bit and let my imagination go off on a tangent"
Eventually I'll grow bored of that and go back to bed.

Don't take ADHD meds anytime other than in the morning.
My doc was cool with me doing it before bed since it wasn’t a stimulant
I can’t keep nodding off while driving man
I didn’t do that when I took it at night
I take a stimulant in the AM for narcolepsy Armodafinil and it doesn’t help when I take adhd in the morning.

What you are describing is called masking or camouflaging which is a way to fit in with the society
 This kinda works in school and work but can be emotionally draining and cause a sense of identity loss in long-term
"

I think a balance of working on behavior management while finding places, activities and people that help you thrive is needed here"
"When a flower doesn’t bloom, we don’t blame it"
We change its environment.
"Aww, love that last quote! And thank you"
"I didn't know it was masking, even though I've heard about it a bit"
I will try to be more intentional in those areas so I can have a bit more peace of mind haha
Thanks!

You are probably using a considerable part of your “brain” to cope with ADHD which can mean less “brain” for other things
 Doesn’t mean you aren’t making full use of it
" But every now and then, you do something that doesn’t require you to fight against your ADHD and viola!

Might this be it?"
This is one of the biggest things I struggle with
"I feel like my brain is this huge, powerful processing machine but it's locked behind a glass wall 80% of the time"
"I can see it running, but can't access it or make it do anything useful"
"

I started medication 2 months ago, and it really helps this feeling."
I completely feel this way
I feel this so hard. 
🤯🤯🤯🤯

I'm tired of trying too
They just don't realize how hard we are working to put on a brave face and keep going
They don't see our brains constantly fighting back our doubts and fears
They just want us to be the perfect thing we have always presented to them
"And if you think they are disappointed in you, god, you can't even imagine how disappointed you are in yourself"
"You've become a puddle, and people love stomping in you"
It is so exhausting man. 
"I do all off the ADHD strategies, I take my medication, Im hyper aware of my quirks, I do everything I can to slow them"
But idk anymore
Why do you keep getting fired?
Don't tell people you have adhd
People who are above you usually try to find any weakness to keep you in your place
Don't tell people about your ailments or tendencies / disabilities
It does absolutely nothing positive for you
 Only way I can see it make sense to tell someone is if you're a drug counselor/ therapist or artist/ musician or freelancer.
"On the bright side, you got 10 jobs in 2 years"
That's not that easy to do.
I also just lost a job yesterday
"Ok, as someone with severe combined adhd I get your struggle, frustration, anger, embarrassment, hopelessness and so on"
"I think you may want to look at your situation a little bit differently, though"
"What are things that you were good at or that you really enjoyed doing? I know that you probably have to have a job to pay the bills, but try to focus your energy into something that is attainable for you build routines intentionally"
"I dk if you take medicine but when prescribed right, this can help A LOT

don't give up just  re-strategize"
I hope this help
!
"Also I just got this book that I'm actually really enjoying because it makes you realize that you're not a person that is alone in this it's  called ""how to adhd"", it's helping me realize that this isn't something that only I go through; and rebuilt some of my confidence."
"A flag, a day, a protected status is just a way for weak people to blame others and demand sympathy....as an ADHD brained person, you are not that"
ADHD has been linked with the warrior gene
You are from a line of brave fighters that forged empires and created history
"It is not easy to put a lion in a cage, so to speak"
Society today is requesting all of your strengths be set aside for the benifit of people who would be the first to seek you out in a time of strife
I would recommend trying to find a job that allows your strengths from ADHD to shine
"Easier said than done, but it is possible"
"Try to find a hobby or outlet that fulfills your brains need for that adrenaline, newness, and need for adventure"
"From experience, the worst thing you can do is give into weakness and allow yourself to wallow in misery"
"As an ADHD'er you have gifts that non ADHD people do not, it is a matter of identifying and working with them to find harmony in life"
One of those gifts is pattern recognition and detaching information from emotion....look very honestly at yourself
"What makes you tick, what patterns of behavior you see in yourself, noticeable reactions you have to situations that continue to happen in your life"
"You are strong and brave, don't tell yourself otherwise, and don't let this worship of weakness society's developed over the past fifteen years seduce you into thinking otherwise."
I'm sorry that sucks
I'm sending a huge hug...
"Look for jobs that emphasize creativity, out-of-the-box ideas, quick thinking"
That’s where you’ll shine as an ADHDer
"Also, please know that if you have ADHD you are protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act (assuming you’re in the U.S.)"
Accommodations can be made to address your specific needs to help you be more comfortable and proud time in the workplace.
"You’re in a protected group, the trick is you must ask for a “reasonable” accommodation"
You may or may not lose some career traction/respect from mentioning you have ADHD
"Personally, I have opted not to disclose"
I don’t trust people to stay neutral.
"You may have already done this...but have you looked into vocational rehab?

I am so sorry you're dealing with this."
What happened?
"Being 28 right now, about to turn 29 in March, this one hits close to home more than you know"
"You really just gotta keep your head down, keep working hard"
Improving yourself
"But most importantly, take care of yourself"
"Mentally, spiritually, emotionally"
"You can spend every second of everyday going over the little mistakes that turned to big mistakes, just playing them back like a broken record"
"But while you do that, try to do some breathing techniques, meditate, I’m a big fan of Frequency Meditation"
7 Months ago I got lucky to get a job in Healthcare as an analyst
I’m used to doing legal or case management work
Let me tell you this job has been everything I didn’t realize I need and more
"Challenging, making me strive to be better, and they’re supportive(mainly moms and young Grandmas)"
"So I lucked out one could say, or I just needed to keep going through the dark before I finally got to see the sun."
I’ve lost a lot in my days too
Your no alone we got use our creativity to make bigger money then the 9-5
"Hey, are you on ADHD meds? Are you under any type of psyche care? Are you drinking or using other recreationals?"
"People don’t understand how hard it is to get out of bed and live the life that everyone else does, or is expected to"
I’m 41 and still just as bad as “adulting” as I was 20 years ago
"But here I am at work, actually got myself to go, and it’s so hard to act like I’m not struggling all day long."
"Attention to detail, efficiency, speed, the usual.
I used to have a tardiness problem but I put self checks in place to fix that"
"This job specifically, (unfortunately they're not the most communicative,) I couldn't tell exactly why they let me go"
"But I assume it had to be something related to my ADHD, whether it was efficiency or something.

I know a big factor was the fact that the boss didn't like me for some reason, or at the very least he didn't respect me"
I always noticed how his attitude changes anytime he has to talk to me or I need to ask a question
"And being that I can't afford too many distractions, I tend to be rather isolated on work because I spend so much energy trying to stay focused which leads me to not mingling amongst my coworkers"
"But even then, this one has me a bit confused"
I know it's something to do with me because every job I've had prior I've been fired from
And that's more than 20.
Or a student in college with late assignments to a professor lol
"Sometimes the honest answer works, and they understand."
[deleted]
Yes!  Do THIS
 Perfectly stated
" 
In a world full of, ""just shut up and do your job"" kind of jobs, many of us are forced to operate in a way that is not how our brains were originally programmed"
" 
We're not handicapped"
" 
Just not in a place where are strengths are fully expressed"
" 
Therefore, learn to adapt"
" 
Or find a new job which feels more natural to you, which you can leave at end of day feeling whole, productive and appreciated."
Exactly - I find this is really good in problem solving roles - and technical stuff.
Oh my God
Thanks for saying that
I'm really struggling because people expect more at our age
The gap between my success and that of my peers has grown so much larger
"And if anything, I feel like I'm actually getting WORSE not better"
I'm scared for the future.
"It sounds like maybe you need to try out some different career paths?  If you keep trying to jam yourself into jobs that are hung up on your weaknesses rather than playing to your strengths, it’s just going to keep sucking."
"Sending hugs, hang in there"
I wonder if you could find a coach who could observe you and help you try to identify what is giving your employers a bad impression (besides the obvious factors that you’ve already noticed)
"You sound like you are trying and you care here, but maybe you don’t seem that way to them"
"Have a lot of your jobs been customer-facing/people focused/emphasis on being part of the team? Maybe you can look for something that is more individualized and just about focusing in and doing the job, where your boss couldn’t care less if you want to mingle"
"I know it’s hard to face family after another setback, but I’m glad it sounds like you have a support system of some kind."
"What do you currently do for your ADHD? Meds? Therapy? It reads like you’re doing it all cold, which could be a big part of the problem?"
"I'm ADHD & have had what felt like terrible bosses at the time, who did not understand how I process"
" 
Having to pull me back in on conf calls, ask me, ""can you get to the point?"" etc"
(THAT never gets old) and let's not even talk about the self-imposed flagulation when I needed to be reminded why I got on my soapbox in the first place
" Shudder  
THAT SAID, I suggest you stop telling people and/or discussing your ADHD"
" 
If you fall short on certain tasks, have reoccuring issues etc"
figure out a system (like you said you'd been doing)
 Work on them quietly
" 
A lot of people use ADHD as a crutch"
" 
Unfortunately the problem now, esp for people unfamiliar with the REAL diagnosis, is everyone gets bunched together as, ""people who blame everything on their ADHD.""  
If you must, I'd rephrase as something like, ""Hey, just wanted to let you know improving in these areas is a top priority for me"
" I'm a little challenged in the focus & concentration area, so takes some extra work on my part"
" But I want you to know I'm on it, thanks for the feedback & I hope that you will continue to provide it, really helps me to know how I'm doing.""  
You don't want to be ""THAT person,"" constantly making excuses for shortcomings"
" 
OWN IT, and tell them what you're doing to FIX IT"
" 
People don't like people who make excuses, but respect accountability"
" 
Just my 2 cents."
People in the workplace only have ever used it against me in the past or when I hear from other people saying they have it or similar things I hear a sickening amount of crap talking between coworkers
" 

But yeah college is definitely an exception."
"Thank you, I get ""You must be fun at parties"" in a sarcastic tense mostly"
"It is an ADHD thing, we have the ability to shut off our emotional attachment, but unlike other non typical brains such as Autism, we have a high emotional depth and radar"
"It often leaves us with an imbalance, either to emotional or shut off"
"It is a skill if you put work into it, because you can understand how, why, and what other people will do/respond to stimuli"
I really recommend reading clinical studies on pattern recognition and emotional intelligence in the ADHD brain
I hope you interview goes well tomorrow!
Yeah that's where I am at this point
Although I've noticed that it seems no matter what job I do I have a hard time maintaining it
"My vertical is architecture and design, but I've done drafting, graphic design, tutoring, worked retail, even just a laborer in sign production, and I have the same problems across the board"
And it's worse how quickly you get dismissed when you bring up ADHD
"And for some reason I'm finding that there's an extremely high rate of ADHD in society or something because the amount of times I hear ""I have ADHD too, well at least when I was a kid, well my brother has it, umm well I just know a guy"" it must be common place"
"Although I know they're just trying to invalidate me hahaha.

I've never been an entitled person and so believe in working for your outcome"
But the most hurtful and devastating part of ADHD is oftentimes you work hard and apply yourself and you get the same results as someone who just doesn't care anymore
"It's hard not to be angry at the world, but in the end, it's just me I can help."
"I have many check and balance in place, medication, I use timers, I have alarms, I carry a notebook everywhere I go"
"I have dedicated days for cleaning, I simplified my wardrobe, when I could afford it, I paid people to do my maintenance (hair, cleaning, etc)"
All of that
"Granted i am pretty extreme on the ADHD scale and I just got diagnosed a little over a year ago, so I'm still learning the ind and outs."
What happened with tutoring gift tutoring another shirt and just be an independent contractor so you can schedule your own sessions
"My thoughts exactly :d

Like I'll do my best and then its like 70% of a normal guys light workday lol.
It is just so hard to keep it going too, normal people have no issues with a full work week and full days"
While I struggle with both lol.
I'm sorry man
" I say to friends who are down like this, sometimes, that it just feels like the universe won't let us win"
 It's all stacked against us
" If there's a luck characteristic that was assigned when we were building our characters, we got a low die roll"
 And that just sucks
  But ya know..
fuck the universe
 Fuck the dice
 You're doing everything you can to change your luck
 You're becoming self aware

 You've only really had a year of real self awareness
 Consider that other people who are your same calendar age have had a lifetime of it to build from
  So keep building; you're on the right path
" Remember, comparison is the thief of happiness"
"  One day, if you keep building and improving yourself, you'll find a path through the game that fits you, or maybe a bug in the game that you can take advantage of, or whatever, and you'll slip on in there and your low die roll won't matter"

"27yo, diagnosed at 25yo with severe ADHD-C, and have been fired from 6 out of my past 7 jobs"
"I mean, for me personally, their decisions to fire me have been primarily related to absenteeism/tardiness, and poor (lack of) communication with management"
"The second of those includes not providing updates on work progress in a timely manner, and being unable to provide updates to customers about possible delays in planned delivery dates because I'm unable to estimate how long something will take me to complete"
"Without knowing when something will actually get done, I don't understand the point in updating them with ""\<some task\> will not be completed by the time originally agreed upon, and I cannot provide a new deadline estimate that I would be confident would not also be missed."" The amount of time it would take me to compose and send such a message would just result in further delays to whatever it is I'm writing the message about"
"

Be it when I will arrive somewhere, when a certain amount of progress will have been reached, or when something will be entirely completed"
The answer is: I have no idea until I'm in the final sprint to the finish line (e.g
"when I'm in my car pulling out of my parking spot, when I'm waiting for an automated delivery process to finish running, or to sum up, when the something I'm doing actually has a distance/time that is externally predetermined (fixed).

Sometimes referred to as Manic Pixie Dream Girl?
"Everyone loves a Manic Pixie Dream Girl until she starts leaving doompiles all over, forgets about dinner plans, and redecorates the house every other month."
"They've made every mental illness ""special"" , not every autistic/ schizophrenic is a genius"
Truth is most of us struggle with our daily lives miserably
"Not only ADHD get's abused by hollywood in that manner.

A youtube channel called pop culture detective analyzes these tactics"
"His video ""born sexy yesterday"" comes to mind"
"You were right when you started with male fantasy, because that's it"
"Instead of really doing something heroic, a normal guy is a hero for that one girl, because she is so absorbed."
"or, worse IMO, the romanticization has led to more normalization—in a bad way"
"ADHD has been distilled by popular media into something illegitimate and hard to believe, seemingly"
"around me, all people seem to know or think are the following media-depicted stereotypes: ADHD = bouncing off the walls hyper, ADHD = spacey and forgetful, ADHD = childish and immature, ADHD drugs = mild, illegal cocaine (my HEALTHCARE ADMIN friend didn’t want me to get medicated because she seems to think it’s a gateway into a lifelong addiction to hard drugs). 

ADHD is rarely, with low effort or minimal explanation, understood as something that can be so severe as to debilitate a life, as to cause someone to not be able to act or think at all sometimes"
"It’s like people don’t believe it’s something serious

s/o my brain fog for being so intense I wanted to cry because I couldn’t think and for fucking up my week from meds not working + increased progesterone

Ik we already talk ab this on this sub, but the lack of awareness and understanding will never cease to frustrate me"
I get where you're coming from but it never hurt my self esteem to think someone out there might find these negative traits attractive
I find the bigger issue to be when it's portrayed as only one miracle guy/person could possibly be attracted to someone like this
These are ADHD symptoms but like they are also my personality since I have ADHD and they are not going away so I prefer a partner who likes me for me but it doesn't hurt if they find these things a bit cute as long as they also know that they are struggles for me
It's a balance really
Hard to show on TV I think.
"Sure, a ditsy and confused teenage girl can be cute"
"Her level of fuck ups will be limited, as long as she does not have real life responsibilities"
"

It's not so charming anymore when she hits middle age and is not to be dependent on by coworkers and family members, worn down by decades of financial and emotional stress, broken relationships, unfinished projects, substance abuse, job hopping or unemployment."
"Can’t tell you the amount of times my female friends have accused me of, mainly who are more of batchmates and less of friends say “Oh don’t try to act so innocent and naive”

"Even non-ADHDers get bored, all we need is a bit more patience."
It’s so frustrating how romanticized adhd symptoms are in movies and on social media rn when I haven’t been able to get my medication regularly for two fucking years now and none of the people talking about how special adhd is seem to give a single fuck about that.
"So then, what's the alternative?  
Featuring attention-challenged people as weak, troubled, mentally ill?  
A lot of people go undiagnosed and/or lack the resources to treat the condition"
" 
I personally believe it's best to acept people as whole, as is"

That it might boost someone's confidence, help them laugh at themselves and or ""feel seen,"" (again, my opinion) is better than addressing in a serious, or negative light."

That term also embraces borderline disorder lol
_eternal shine of the spotless mind_ - Clementine is very much an untreated bpd.
I hate that term tho
And even the person who coined the term now hate it
It awfully trivializes the variety of characters with interesting traits into one single trope that doesn’t really mean anything.
Ahahahaha
This is an inspiration behind my username.
Literally just the orher end of a guys fantasy of having a mentally ill girlfriend
"You have the ""I'm so depressed, I don't need anyone and im a loner..."" mentally ill girlfriend fantasy vs the ""I'm literally having a manic episode, and have multiple disorders!!"" Mentally ill girlfriend fantasy"
Two sides of the same coin 😭

"Most rom coms is about a dude showing up with a unique and  different perspective or approach that will save the girl from herself, heal her traumas, or show that her life purpose was all wrong, including having a successful career lol"
They also do this with strong women

"It's strange that non-ADHD folks think meds are a gateway, when me and most other ADHDer hate taking meds and try only talking them when necessary"

"he would tell me ""you need to come to me"" and would literally act like he needed to put his foot down sometimes to 'correct' me."
It's autism's turn.
This is literally what (almost)everyone’s opinion here is
So the opposite of controversial haha
"It’s not just BPD though - the trope is often brought up when talking about autism, ADHD, bipolar etc"
because it’s intentionally vague about the “what” in the character and uses collections of traits often associated with those disorders.

I think diagnosing a fictional character based on a single movie is legit… extremely uncool
"Armchair diagnoses are bad, and there’s really no evidence to support what you’re saying."
I think that was the commenter’s point.

"well, it is considerably easier than not being one"
"and the special dude is not very special at all, he was only raised right or something like this"
He is only special for the girl
bonus points if the girl is hot once she removes her glasses.
Ewwwwww
My boyfriend and I do that playfully like when I dump my clothes on the floor or he leaves the toothbrush on the sink
I could not imagine my man seriously making me walk up to him like a child who's going to get detention.
Autism is more like a comeback since its depiction in “Rain Man” created an awareness full of myths in 1988

You really should read scientific articles up from 2020 instead of stating prejudiced opinions as facts.

Like this part ""That or someone hurt you, and you think that PDs being neurological means that whoever that may be is just ""choosing to be that way"""""
It being neurological would mean quite the opposite
"But I'm not saying that they're choosing it themselves either.

My comment on neuroplasticity was meant to say that people's brains change with their environment and their behaviour (so yes, trauma and abuse can chance the brain.), and that those studies didn't prove that bpd was due to organic physiology (as in determined at birth)"
"The disordered personality could just as well have come first, and led to this redistribution of matter that those studies reveal"
It's just not controlled for
"I'm not saying they're wrong, I'm telling you two that those studies aren't saying what you think they're saying.

It's wild how much this set you off, and how much you assumed about me based on so little"
"I am a psych student, and as recently as this tuesday attended a lecture by a leading professor on personality disorders, about personality disorders"
He said exactly that; personality disorders are not something you're born with
They're caused by environment
That is a criteria in the ICD-10
"The two first studies are based on brain scans at a single point in time of people who have been diagnosed with BPD since childhood, and find some significant differences in specific brain areas, and no significant difference in others (where they did expect to find them)"
But that doesn't prove that BPD is a neurologically based disorder
"The brain is plastic and changes due to environmental factors and behaviour, to better fit our environment"
"Our environment and behaviour makes visible changes to distribution of matter in our brain, so this could just as easily be a result of this"
One of the studies even mention this themselves in a bit of an offhand way (could be due to publication bias)
This doesn't prove a \*\*causational\*\* relationship
"One of them is based on a sample of 19 women, and they didn't control for comorbidities.

The last study is pretty good methodologically, but again doesn't prove anything"
"It points towards there being a genetic factor, but that is again a question of perspective"
"It could just aswell be environment, or a genetic predisposition which then triggers due to environment, which doesn't mean it qualifies as a neurological disorder"
"A staggering 95,7% of the sample also had comorbid diagnosis"
"There may be genetic factors, but it would be bad scientific practice to say that because of this study alone"
"The authors themselves call for further research aswell.

\*\*The general criteria for personality disorders in the current day world of psychology, includes that the symptoms can not better be described by another organic etiology or mental illness.\*\* (in the ICD-10+11 at least.)"

"3-4 years in the UK, too"
"

The exponential increase in ADHD awareness along with a world mentally drained by COVID produced a crisis the healthcare system is not equipped to handle"
"

In short, mental healthcare demand has shot up"
But ADHD expertise to diagnose and treat is still very limited.
In the states we have doctors you can see over telehealth
The appointments tend to be quicker since they can bang out the sessions over zoom at a pace
"

I don't know what the laws are like out in Denmark but maybe look into that? That's how I recently found my doctor."
That's weird
"I'm a Swede, I waited 6 months here,, my friend a year, another friend , went to Denmark because the waitlist there wasn't as long.
She got to see a Psychiatrist in only a few weeks"
(I don't know any details about more precicely where)
Reading things like this makes me grateful that i live in the US
"I've been complaining about the cost to see a doctor lately, but now i realize i don't have it as bad"
I wish there was something i could do to help you
I was in your situation for a few years because i couldn't afford proper care so i know how you feel
I also went most of my life being unmedicated and it held me back by so much.
I hope you find someone who can help you sooner
Have you checked with your kommune? There might be someone like a nurse who can help you while you wait
"

https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/indland/guide-saadan-goer-du-hvis-du-faar-en-psykisk-lidelse"
Only good side of the privatization of medicine here in the states
It’ll cost you three months rent for help but you can get someone same day.
I'm in Denmark too
Had to go through a private psychiatrist to get diagnosed
"Thankfully got it covered by work insurance but only for the diagnosis and 3 months of follow up.

The problem now is that I want to change dosage/medication and only a psychiatrist can do it so I need to go through waiting list again or pay for a private one, and they're not cheap."
Yeah ! I’ll try looking for private clinics
I understand I have to pay but the waitlists are MUCH shorter 🙏
It’s more that people can’t afford to go to a paid doctor
If someone has no money there is no choice
Wages are extremely high in America
You may not realise but even going to a fast food place is expensive for some people in Europe
Let alone paying for a doctor
"In the EU, you can also get same-day appointments at private clinics and doctors, but that's not what OP is referring to"
"OP is waiting for state medical care, which typically has longer wait times but is free and generally provides good quality service"
No one here prevents you from seeking paid private medical care
Having access to both public and private healthcare is better than having only expensive private options
"While the US has assistance programs for low-income individuals, these differ significantly from the comprehensive social support systems found in most European Union countries."
I'm aware
I didn't get an official diagnosis until 2 months ago and i'm 28
"I was relying on a free clinic for 8 years, but i was misdiagnosed and they had the worst service so when i say i understand, i really do"
They kept pushing depression and anxiety on me because i'm a woman
The worst part is that they were female doctors themselves
"You'd think they'd try to understand better, but i realized that's not the case lol"
"One even insisted that i had Bipolar disorder, but i've never even had mania once in my life?"
Oh don’t get me wrong I hate our system.

What type of questions you don’t want to answer?
"We don’t know anything about you, so what are some things about you that we might be interested in asking questions about?"
What regrets do you have?
how long ago did you get medicated? does it work well now? what did it fix? what did it not?
What kind of things do you do for fun/decompressing?
Who are you 😁
What does medication feel like
I’ve got adhd (14M) and wonder whether medication would benefit me at school or home
"Just an update because I forgot to put it in earlier, I'm only taking one question per person"
No
"Anything involving politics, my home country/town, work life, sex life, these are ones I'd rather keep personal"
"My favourite genre of music is rock, I also have Autism, my favourite colour is blue, I prefer Xbox over PlayStation, I have an uncle and a nephew who have ADHD as well, my favourite pizza topping is pepperoni"
Not getting an ADHD diagnosis during my childhood
"I was medicated the day after my diagnosis, which was over a month ago, I was prescribed Ritalin and it helped with slowing down my mind, it made me less fidgety, more attentive and very productive.

About 2 weeks in, I started getting side effects like irritability, aggression, headaches, dry mouth, thoughts of suicide and attempting it until I snapped myself out of it.

I stopped taking it and have been medication free since, I will be seeing my psychiatrist again soon to change my medication because Ritalin did me more harm than good."
I'm either playing my Xbox Series S or listening to music
A human being lol
"I'm not on medication anymore, but when I was , I took Ritalin and I felt more attentive, productive and less fidgety but 2 weeks in, I got side effects and had to stop taking it.

It also depends on the person or the medication they take, not everyone will react the same.

It'll definitely benefit you at home and at school, but it depends on what medication you use and how your body reacts to it"
If I had a second question I’d ask what games you like on the Xbox.
Is that a decision that you regret or something you had no control over
About
"When or if someone asks me that, you can read my answer"
"I had no control over it, my parents don't really understand the disorder"

I have found that omega-3 fish oil has been a huge help with my anxiety
 It’s the only one they’ve really studied and it actually does help to some extent with anxiety and depression
" Of course do your own research to decide, but it has helped me and I can feel when I’ve missed a day or two."
Absolutely
They go hand in hand

OP i recognize this 200 procent
Especially the running into people you know
For me the adhd + social anxiety give my brain a blue screen of death in sudden social situations
As a result I come across as a stuttering high pitched weirdo
Which doesnt  help for my self esteem lol
So definitly feel your pain.
I have ADHD and anxiety and take medication for both
"The ADHD medication was not enough for my anxiety, and I need a little extra to help me"
"It changed my life, and I can't imagine being here today without it ( I take fluoxitine)"
I also have focused heavily on mental control and mindset (I know everyone says that) but telling myself particular things and imagining other people POV definitely gets me out there
I know it may not work for others but over the years I think it has helped me alot
Good luck!
Stimulant medications didn’t help? Or make it worse?
Currently I am taking atomoxetine
Will it help or will it worsen the condition
Or before bed
"Weights, stretches.
Edit to add: planks, squats."
Mine is less on meds
"I have a bit more control over my brain, but if I'm tired, or didn't sleep well, I'm definitely more anxious regardless"
I also think it's a deep partnership with ADHD.
That’s a good question
"

I’m often anxious due to being overwhelmed"
I also take stimulants to help me be productive
"But, they also ratchet up the anxiety"
The balance is worth the tradeoff most days
"I think that if I’m productive, that helps me walk back some anxiety."
I love going to bed
It means I’ve survived the day and I get to close my eyes without anyone bothering me for 8-10 hours
"If I don’t work out first thing in the morning, I get stuck in an anxiety trap"
"Ya, for me I've always exercised at night"
I used to run outside at night as well
Works well for me for decades.

Sick of myself

"If one thing's for sure, it's that you're not alone! In fact you've almost described me within this post"
"I am late diagnosed a few months ago at 28, also female"
I also have comorbid depression
"

However I DID end up addicted to drugs and alcohol both, on an impulse I applied to university despite never once in my life having any sort of inclination to attend, I didn't even finish high school lol"
I also had not a dollar to my name at the time
"Went to rehab shortly after because of something nasty that happened, then moved immediately after that to a city I had never lived in, out on my own for the first time"
"It's a big move, I'm from a tiiinyyy country town"
"

I'd like to say I really got in and pushed through my studies, but honestly it was one disaster after the next"
"After covid I couldn't afford to live there anymore, so at 26 I very unceremoniously moved back in with my parents and quit my studies"
"Except I didn't actually withdraw either, I literally just kinda up and left"
"I was newly sober, which truly did not last long at all, on my own for the first time and with untreated ADHD, broke and just couldn't seem to care less that things were falling to pieces around me"
"I continued on and off the self medication, fell into a deep depression, told my boss to go fuck himself and left my job"
"Around here there isn't a whole lot of work going so now I also had zero income, it took 3 months to find a new job"
"

I too thought ADHD ruined everything, and I didn't even understand ADHD at the time, only in hindsight can I see how it literally was the catalyst for all of these things"
I was addicted to illicit stimulants because they almost had an 'opposite' effect on me (which I did not realise was NOT everybody else's experience too until I was in a meeting in rehab lol)
I ran away to a new city because of an impulsive decision I had absolutely not thought through
I couldn't study because of it
All my money was gone because of it
"I'd lost interest in things that made me happy, so I became numb instead.

Literally every time I have tried  to do something positive for myself, it bites me in the ass or some negative thing is just waiting around the corner"
"Even as recently as this diagnosis! It was amazing to have a diagnosis, and to be treated"
Starting meds made everything make sense for the first time and I thought I could do literally anything I wanted
"The caveat? I was also diagnosed with CPTSD at the time too, and it just so happens the meds work so great that in having a clear mind for the first time in my life and an ability to focus on what I want to, the PTSD that had previously been dulled by that mess of constant thoughts has decided to make itself the centre of attention in my mind"
I still don't know how to deal with this
"

But you know what? I currently have a partner, met him accidentally"
Didn't want a partner
"Was happy being single forever, I like being on my own"
Turned out to be the love of my life
"The downside to THAT is he lives quite far away now, and it's expensive to try and move in together but we're getting there"
"I work a pretty shitty job just above minimum wage, with a small team of pretty cool people even if we literally are at each other's throats at times"
"Classic overworked/underpaid scenario, it's a nightmare most days.

But I'm getting there"
"I don't have a lot in the way of advice, but I shared all of this to let you know I completely understand and you are not alone"
"Don't look at your past as you have 'wasted' your life, because someday you come to realise all of this stuff happens for a reason"
"Right now, even the horrific situations that caused my PTSD, I wouldn't change them, because I now have the power of (medicated) hindsight and I realise that the hardships I've endured all these years have also made me a lot stronger, as much as they break me down at times"
"They have taught me skills that are unique to someone in my situation, they have given me senses that now help KEEP me out of danger"
"I can't change the past, I can't ever know what would happened if I was diagnosed earlier or didn't end up on drugs or didn't try to literally throw my life away, so instead I choose to embrace that and focus on the fact that the past is the past, but every day is a new future"
"It might take months, or even years, but I know I will get there because I have freed myself from being chained down by the past and how so much went wrong because of something that I may have been able to prevent had I been properly diagnosed earlier"
"

I'm currently also stuck in a rough spot, depression is pretty bad right now, PTSD causing my anxiety to go through the roof, work is stressful and physically taxing"
"I find myself unable to perform basic human things again, so I am not eating enough, drinking enough or going to bed at a reasonable time, or at all sometimes"
That means my medication is far less effective and man can I notice! I haven't got a clue what I want to do for a 'career' and I know I don't want to work this min wage job forever
"I have no real interests, very few friends and nobody to hang out with, so I put my energy and focus into my job"
"But you know what? As much as I am suffering at the moment, strangely enough I am also just fine"
And I really think that's because I've allowed myself to let go
It will pass
"Always has, there's always been better days"
"Been plenty of bad, but I have always seen better days before falling back in, so they WILL come"
"You're not alone, and I really hope some of this resonates even a little and that you start to make it through soon"
"If you're not already, I'd recommend seeing a therapist to help you work through it too, it sometimes helps to just have an outside perspective and someone to listen."
You have purpose and you're special
"Hear me when I say this, the shit around you, your job, business, and/or business / intellectual success is not your identity"
If you fail in a business
If you go bankrupt
"If you lose everything, you are still the same person and your identity is still the exact same"
We are not our job
We are not our papers / certificates
Accepting this allows us to be ourselves and to rarely get offended
"For me, this led me to the (limited but rewarding) business experiences I've had"
"

Odd to say and I don't know you but I feel like your calling may not be in certifying up and/or working for another person"
It may be that you're blessed to create your own thing
Genius and money are not necessarily linked
One billionaire produces lots of rubber seals that go around pipes to seal them
Your success need not be overly complex
Make a start on something and as you go you will figure it out
Meanwhile I'd try and stick with the study even if that means asking to take a period of leave to regroup and reset your mind
"

Worry about nothing"
"So hard to do but I say ""fuck it"" and ""fuck everyone:"" I care nil nada nothing about anyone's opinions, I do what I know is right I move in integrity and I do things out of passion"
I run on my own time

"Man, sugar addition is a real bitch"
I know how hard it can be
I can't provide answers but I can at least try and provide you with understanding of what you're going through
"

Since you were only recently diagnosed with ADHD, try and focus on the treatment of that"
"Depression can go hand-in-hand with ADHD, so if you can work with a doctor to get the ADHD treated, it may help the depression subside as well"
"At the very least, getting out of the mental brain freeze I get with ADHD helps me to get shit done.

I was in the place you were in in my mid-20s as well (currently 46)"
"I never really dated, never thought I would find anyone who would like me for me (after all, I didn't like me)"
"I did discover, though, there were a lot of people out there, and the only way to find someone is to take a chance"
"I did, over and over, but finally found someone"
"It takes work, but as much as I still kinda lack self-esteem, I have a decent enough life now"
"Don't try and fix everything at once, but try and do one thing, one small step at a time and things will get better."
"Don worry I can promise there is light at the end of the tunnel a lot of us feel similar to how you’re feeling right now swethart don’t shutdown or start hating yourself it will only make it worse, try to tek it one day at a time, one task at a time and see how det works"
"You're still very young and have loads of time ahead of you, you really shouldn't be so hard on yourself at the age of 26"
I understand you feel stuck but you have so many years ahead to become unstuck
"Not ro diminish what you're going through but I'm 53 and feel the same but I'm on the downward side of my life, I still have hope..."
Ok so I am not an adult (but I'll be one next year) but reading your post just idk it's familiar
I too just sometimes am sick of myself
It feels like I am in a loop
I waste time well knowing I am gonna regret it but unable to stop myself
It sucks when you can't even control yourself
But I didn't choose to comment to trauma dump
I feel like I shouldn't
Idk if reading this will make you feel better
Idk if you'll even read this but..
"here's what I wanna say:

I really can't give you an advice because I have yet to figure these things out myself"
But I just desperatly want to make you feel better
"I know I am invalid, I am not even in my 20s yet"
But Try to...try to accept yourself
"I know It's very very hard, I still havn't but I am slowly trying to.

What I have learned is that you can't escape yourself, you can't erase your existance (ok, I know this is a bit inaccurate but we shouldn't erase ourselves)"
Maybe you can make a list of the things you have ever enjoyed to do and look at that list and decide what you wanna resume
"Do you have anyone you trust? anyone you are close too?

If you have reach out talk please"
"I know it's hard (I can't do that) but just do it.

Maybe adopt a pet, a cat or a dog"
"They might make you feel needed.

Whenever you have negative thoughts remind yourself that It's O.K"
"You are not ALONE.

Maybe keep a journal, write whatever you are feeling.

Look, I don't know you, and there is no way for me to knowing what you are feeling"
I apologize if this reply isn't apropriate
"I just feel the same way as you do sometimes (i am not invalidating your struggles, your's are definetly more than mine) but after overcoming a struggle you are stronger and better than before even if you don't feel like it.

Lost in the moment again"

One day Life will be kind.

(Just some relatable lines from one of my fav song)"
"This reminds me of myself in my twenties,now 47"
I'm still the uncoordinated unpractical person with the attention span of a goldfish but I've learnt self acceptance
"I found cognitive therapy really helpful.
Relationship wise,I gave up on women,then my wife landed in my lap."
I'm also in same situation
"Doom scrolling, getting damned in life"
And I also really don't know what to do about it anymore.
"Why are your anti-depressants reduced if you weren’t ready for it? Were they tapered off properly?  How recently? Might you be in a low mood because it was lowered within the last few days? Adjusting within the first days might be rough, just wondering if there is any correlation."
Adopting a pet is NOT a good idea (in my opinion)
" 
In fact, it's a TERRIBLE one"
"(again, my opinion)  
Someone struggling to maintain, out of work, etc"
"especially with depression and/or ADHD should not take on added responsibility of caring for an animal, esp one whose temperament & behavior is unknown"
" 
Better idea - volunteer at local shelter"
" Many are short on help & need people to assimilate these dogs (many fearful, abused, scared of humans etc) so they are adoptable"
"   
And welcome volunteers to walk/exercise/play with them"
" 
In fact, I recently saw a video in which a group of kids regularly visited a dog shelter, just sat outside a dog's cage & read to him/her"
 This had a notable difference on the dog's temperment & comfort with humans
" 
If you feel ready to take on the responsibility, consider fostering"
" This is a temporary gig & while hard to say good bye after falling in love, you're literally saving dogs' lives"
" 
The BIG BONUS - we are programmed to help & give to tothers"
Why I say this - doing so has a NOTEABLE & DOCUMENTED SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECT ON STRESS
" 
Maybe a result of just focusing on something else besides ""your failures & dumb ADHD brain,"" for awhile"
" 
Or feeling productive, like you matter and you're making a difference"
" 
Maybe bc it gets us out of the house, gives a sense of purpose?  
Maybe something bigger?  
Who knows, IT WORKS"
"   
ANOTHER BONUS - it's very hard to get fired as a volunteer"
" I mean, you really have to work at it to be let go"
"   
So that's what I recommend."
Basically I was on 40mg citalopram back in July when I got diagnosed
I quickly came down to 20mg for a few months and then recently went down to 10mg
I also tried Vyvanse at this time but it just made me anxious so I came off it
This was all my idea and was approved by my psychiatrist
I guess I didn't think I needed them as much as I apparently do
"These feelings are always there though, just exacerbated by lack of medication"
I don't know what to do.
"Hey, I am sorry.
I didn't mean to give terrible ideas I just thought that a pet might make things better like could give motivation and stuff.
Yeah, she can volunteer it's her choice"
"However it's easy.
Sorry again."
"I don’t want to encourage or discourage medication, it’s not my place to especially if it’s your choice"
"But keep in mind, a recent diagnosis can bring a lot to process"
"

You are not your ADHD, and you should be conscious about what meaning you give to it"
 A diagnosis explains a lot but looking at issues with a pre-determined destination is a generalization fallacy
(a.k.a
All of my negative experiences are MY FAILURES that were SOLELY and DELIBERATELY CHOSEN by ME and this is DESERVED because of MY ADHD.)

I took 10mg extended release for a month before switching to 10mg instant release twice a day
"Never noticed irritability or rage on extended release, but there have been a few days here and there were I do feel irritated in the evening after the second dose has worn off"
Eating a meal before my second dose seems to help with the irritation in the evenings.
My friend took BOTH her kids off adderall because this is what she saw
They went from nice happy kids to assholes.

"First of all, 48h is not a normal work week, it’s quite a bit more, so there’s that"
"

Second, if you’re still in training or very early in your career that is far and away the most exhausting time b/c you’re still learning"
"

Third, there’s a high rate of depression in people with ADHD and that can be a cause tearfulness and fatigue as well"
If this might be you that’s worth talking to therapist about
"

Fourth, perhaps you need a dose boost on your ADHD meds?"
Things like electrolytes and magnesium and anything without vitamin C is good to pair with them and also after taking ur medication getting productive right after
"Thank you, I will look into this! I am not exactly starting, but my work week is getting longer every month"

If you're underweight the solution isn't to limit medication that's working
That is just accepting the issue with your diet
"HOWS ABOUT YOU FIX THE DIET?! 

I had no issues eating on adderall"
"
Is the dose too high maybe? 

2"
Is the medication original adderall? For nausea I only get this when breakfast is inadequate
"

Always have breakfast"
Ensure it has protein
"
Eg toast"
Eggs
Turkey bacon
"

PEANUT BUTTER banana & honey on toast! Protein shake on side.

Keep nuts nearby"
"Eat them all day, just a few here and there.

Laden everything in peanut butter"
It seems to make all of my meds for adhd work better
"

Finally I take a good multivitamin"
"https://www.inessawellness.com/products/inessa-advanced-daily-multivitamin

Always eat breakfast prior to first adderall dosage"
Adderall makes your brain burn all fuel inside of you
Hence you should be eating more
"The medication breaks hunger signals initially, hence do not rely on that as a gauge"
"

3"
If taking any SSRIs there are interactions between some
"

4"
If you've got IBS / bloating etc you may be enzyme deficient
Find a product with makzyme-pro in the ingredients listing
"

You matter"
Eat
Supplement
Drink lots of water fluids
"I can say, I'm never not hungry now, but I've taken adhd meds since 2018"
"I'd say it was a year or two until I got actual hunger back, before i continued to eat either way."

"I take stimulant medication, and it's not necessary to take it every day"
I feel like it's in my system and then out the same day
"

It has absolutely improved my life"
"I'm older (in my 40s) and found that my ADHD symptoms significantly worsened as my hormone levels changed in perimenopause and I was struggling to cope.

The differences I notice in my brain are that I feel like a barrier to doing things is removed or lessened (so I think ""I need to open that mail and pay a bill"" and then I can just.."
"do it instead of having to wrestle myself into it), and I feel less urgent restlessness that drives me to do things that give me the most immediate good feelings"
I'm able to tackle things that take more sustained focus or make decisions towards my long term goals
"

I don't notice a change in my personality or feelings like with SSRIs"
"The only side effects I have to contend with is less appetite and making sure I don't take it too late in the day that it disrupts my sleep.

It's been the easiest medication to try out in my experience, because stimulants aren't something you have to build up in your system over time and take a while to work back out when you stop."
"If you decide on a stimulant you don’t have to necessarily take it everyday but after taking it for a while you might notice when you don’t 

And in my experience I feel like with most of these medications they start out with a bunch of motivation then you slowly get used to it unless you change the dosage I feel like it has improved my life with myself mentally (I’m on Adderall) but I do feel dependent on it which sucks some days but I can survive without it if that makes sense

With medication I feel like I can think way clearer only thing that sucks is timing it because I know at the end of the day it wears off"

What have you found works best for improving ADD forgetfulness?

Definitely notes and for me alarms on my phone
"I have alarms set to take trash out, take medications, etc.

Phones can be a blessing and a curse with ADHD but it has a lot of tools that can help out a lot."

This is science telling me “You are so smart and have so much potential but…” all over again.
"They made me do an IQ test as part of my psych evaluation, and apparently, I scored higher than average.
When I told the psychiatrist what's the point of having a high IQ if I couldn't function, they ended up diagnosing me with severe depression and General anxiety disorder"
When I got my diagnosis I begged them to look for something else that caused this and they just prescribed me anti-depressants 🫠
I was actually diagnosed with ADD by the same psychiatrist who IQ tested me and declared me to be a genius
"He actually ran the IQ test twice, months apart"
"I scored almost the same both times but I don't remember the details of which areas I was ok in and which were worse, I just remember the numbers that I hate telling people.

I was 8 years old at the time so I was diagnosed fairly early.

He missed the autism, OCD, GAD, and PTSD though"
"And I technically have ADHD-C...

At the time you couldn't be diagnosed with both ADD and Aspergers or autism though, so I guess the adhd was just more obviously affecting me.

He also diagnosed my Mum with ADD and my older brother with ADHD.

My Mum has autism too and was actually almost diagnosed with it, in the EARLY 60s"
She was very young and the doctor told my grandmother that my Mum and her twin sister were right on the border of being classed as Autistic
"Nothing happened after that until my youngest sibling was diagnosed when my Mum was in her mid 40s.

Just over six months after the first psychiatrist diagnosed my family he declared that he had cured us all of ADD/ADHD"
Then he refused to see us again
"My Mum tried to get another psychiatrist to see us all but we were on welfare so he was literally the only one we were allowed to see.

My Mum couldn't afford to pay private prices so we just went on with our lives, knowing we had adhd but not being able to get medication or allowances at school.

I'm still angry"
He's dead
"Otherwise I'd give him an earful, I don't care how old he'd be"
Fuck you Dr Craft.
"I got diagnosed at 30, even though my 20s were a dumpster fire, because of this exact reason"
"Good thing is that every day I get closer to 40, I feel a little bit dumber, so my IQ and ADHD will match at some point"
/s
The data clearly has covariance in it
 I don't disagree with the overall findings
I didn't get diagnosed until my 50s as IQ does help mask for some people
There is also a problem with sample size
 There does appear to be a lower bound limit as IQ increases but there is higher max at normal IQ levels.
"How do I reread many times & not see typos until after I post? Constantly. 


Unmedicated"
Diagnosed a month ago
I guess I must have a very high IQ ;)
Hello to all my fellow ADHDers who recognise themselve in this.
Tbh the correlation between IQ and age of diagnosis shown in the article is really less than spectacular
"Yes, there is a correlation but it accounts for only a small fraction of the variance seen in the age of diagnosis."
"Yeah, big ""Duh"" moment for everyone"
I took an IQ test when a friend was going through her psychology program
"I scored high, but she said my results were ""interesting"""
I should have gone to a psychiatrist then.
I got diagnosed when I was 8years old
I guess that confirms my suspicion of low IQ 😔
"Not that the effect isn't true, the plot shown in the article seems to indicate a fairly weak relationship with a likely fairly weak r^2 value based on the plot points"
This seems like an example of the headline oversensationalizing the actual finding.
"After reading the comments, am I the only one that was diagnosed later in life and wasn't some secret genius through the years?"
The first thing my son’s psychiatric nurse told us was that because he was so successful academically he couldn’t have ADHD
He never got less than an A and was the senior class Salutatorian
He agonized over his schoolwork and we were his safety net for 13 years
He would need almost constant supervision and attention and he was so smart he knew this
He would melt down at the thought of staying on track for papers and assignments
It was awful for all of us
"

I knew this doctor was wrong, but I just didn’t have the knowledge or courage to back up my own intuition about this"
I felt like we failed him
"

He is finally diagnosed (as am I - at age 50) after having to drop out of college because he had no real support and couldn’t take care of himself"
"Now he is medicated and in therapy, back in school and has two jobs"
"

But it has been a very hard journey."
Got diagnosed at 8
Glad to finally be confirmed stupid.
Diagnosed at 4 so I guess I would score super low on a scored IQ test
The other side of life is affected by this
Highly functioning and smart people are diagnosed with dementia or other such things later too because all the tests for it show you’re not as bad off as you or your family thinks you are
They don’t see how far down you’ve come only you’re still better off that most folks they see
Not that there are many actually useful treatments for that but it delays getting the ones that are there.
This is very real
One of my psychology professors told me I need to get checked for ADHD when she was supervising my undergrad dissertation
I then got a masters in neuropsycbology and recognised myself in ADHD symptoms we were discussing during a lecture
Who knows when I would get diagnosed if I didn't go into studying psychology
I am eternally grateful
"


You suffer in silence when you are academically gifted, but underperforming due to ADHD symptoms"
"I lost count how many times I cried after school because teachers kept bullying me in front of other students, called me ""lazy"" and ""careless"", told my parents that I don't care about my future and that I would be lucky to even be accepted into university, let alone hope to get into prestigious ones"
"

When I was crying and saying ""Something is wrong with me"" to my mother, she told me that ""You are fine, you just need to organise yourself"""
I felt like an alien who had to pretend to be a human for so long.
"This tracks,  my IQ is 75 , and I was the first person in my school to be tested in 1983 ."
"Obvious to those who've been through it, but this really really deserves to be more widely known."
"I learned I had ADHD during the menopause, suddenly a lot of my trials and tribulations made sense (and I mourned the fact that ADHD in women and girls is so poorly understood)"
"

I was a so called “gifted” child “without discipline or application” :(  I hope that kids like me are supported to achieve their potential these days."
"me being a black woman with a high iq who was diagnosed at 21: oh my god 😧 who could have guessed⁉️

edit: i had a good psychologist actually who gave me just a multi section iq test,,, i scored badly in comparison to my other scores on the short term memory portion"
Aren't IQ test results notoriously unreliable and misleading anyway?
“You’re smart enough to mask this…” “you’re not disruptive and get your work done.”
"45 years old, diagnosed at 44"
So many things made sense afterwards
"Engineering degree followed by  JD, but couldn't count 50 pieces of candy without losing track"
"Full trifecta of anxiety, depression and ADHD"
Once we started addressing the first two and I developed bandwidth to see how much the third was dragging me down
Vyvanse has given me a glimpse of what life could've been
"
I get down sometimes thinking about how much of my life was spent circling the drain struggling but I learned some things that I wouldn't have otherwise"
I do miss that feeling of being locked and managing when the level of stimulation was just at the perfect point where my brain was at best what it was built for
Cooking and driving are a bit more challenging.
142 IQ as a kid
Diagnosed at 52
This tracks.
"Not always, i was diagnosed with severe hyperactive-impulsive adhd at the age of 4 and aspergers at the age of 8 have been identified as gifted, out of the box thinker all through my childhood into adulthood, by the time i was 20 i could already predict consequenses, organize, do household, live idependently, read social cues, budget, eat healthy and save as well as a 25 years old, by the time i was 23 i felt 30 in terms of living and making decisions and attitude"
Diagnosed at 40 - I must be a genius!
I was diagnosed on my 6th birthday in 1999
So pretty early
"And my IQ is quite high, or it was back then (129)"
"

However I was blatantly hyperactive and disruptive in class and left all my work to the last minute as the bell rang"
There’s always outliers.
"IQ isn't really ""real"" though"
"It more reflects time/resources being able to be spent on your development than a purely INHERENT or genetically set variable for life.

IQ is essentially reflective of your ability to understand non traditional analogies."
I think I probably got lucky
I tested for a high IQ when I was younger
I was in the gifted program
I just so happened to get court-ordered to go see a therapist after a chance run-in with the police when I was 14 or so
Was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder
Fell in love with psychology because it finally gave me some answers
Learned about ADHD
Was cognizant enough of my own symptoms to understand that I fit the criteria
Brought it up with my therapist after multiple spin-outs on the highway due to distractions and a noticeable reduction in my ability to hold focus on one thing
Got diagnosed around 17.
Makes sense
I never studied at all
"I bullshit my way through all of my homework and tests, usually completing things at the last minute"
I only did homework to keep my parents off my ass
"Even when I was in college, I studied rarely and still did well.

I was diagnosed when I was 24, after years of complaining to mental health professionals."
It weirdly ended up being the opposite for me? I was diagnosed in second grade because they thought I might have had a developmental delay
They tested me and saw a relatively silly high IQ and figured out I was just really REALLY bored and had ADHD.
"Yeah, I have 128 IQ (and my lower pontuation was the speed of processing information, and I was not medicated at the time, so it is probably higher) and got diagnosed last month with 20 years"
"It wouldve taken a longer time if I wasnt in the higher economic status, white maternal ethnicity and a man"
"Really sucks that the disparity of socioeconomic conditions, racism and sexism turn an already hard life even harder for longer time."
"It may have some merit, but definitely doesn’t apply to all"
I scored a 138 iq test and was diagnosed at age 6
"Could be related to comorbidities though, I also have Tourette’s which is much easier to diagnose and has an extremely high correlation with ADHD."
"I have a high IQ and only started struggling in late HS because i could barrel through most classes by just figuring it out, thsnks to my parents (obviously) it just means im fucking lazy, its so annoying to have to be told what im experiencing is fake and that im intentionally js wasting my potential for some reason, I hate it sm"
"I was 43, and I figured it out for myself"
"Yes, I have an actual diagnosis"
🤣
Yeah I had an almost perfect SAT score but didn't get officially diagnosed into 33 years later
Ppl
I feel a little called out
Grew up in a decently upper middle class environment and am not white
Was not diagnosed until end of college
Brilliant but lazy.
Glad there's finally a study proving what I've been saying for years
"My brother exhibited hyperactive symptoms, I'm primary inattentive"
He was diagnosed in elementary or middle school
I was diagnosed at..
"26.
(Guess what percentile I was ranked in for FSIQ?)"
"I did a full evaluation and got diagnosed when I was 11 or 12, and my IQ test score was 99th percentile"
"Not a brag, IQ only covers certain types of intelligence"
"Oh cool, I’m hella literate"
"I also regularly walk into walls and I do not have common sense

On the other side of it, I’m now in my early thirties and just now getting diagnosed with OCD because it’s largely internalized lol"
"

BUT I was a suuuper anxious kid and in therapy from a young age"
The dramatic disconnect between loving learning and struggling with focus and processing could be noticed despite being a girl who learned to mask really well.
Heck of a scatter on that plot
" Check the axes, too."
I got a perfect ACT score and a full-ride into a prestigious college before I received my ADHD diagnosis my senior year of high school
"I always felt something was wrong, but I was great at cramming and pulling all-nighters."
"I saw a neuropsych at 15 who literally gave me an IQ test and then told me, ""You are too smart, you don't have ADHD."" So yeah, very easy to believe."
"Nice to have science confirm what my gut knew was true.

Between this and being an adult and female, when I finally sought a diagnosis I intentionally got referrals for practitioners who already worked with adult women with ADHD who were in ""high profile""/""high demand"" careers (doctors, lawyers, academics/ to minimize the impact those factors might have in preventing me from getting an accurate diagnosis."
lol
"In other news, humans are made of carbon and water!"
Yeah that checks out
Decently high IQ and didn't get diagnosed until 30s
Always been curious to do the test again while on medication.
[removed]
This is kinda interesting to me
IQ tests have been shown to correlate with working memory tests
Some well known models also suggest that a major component of working memory is a central executive that relies a lot on attentional capacity
It stands to reason that IQ tests should be decent for catching some aspects of attention “deficits.”
I got mine at 30 and i got some 135 (top2%) in generalized intelligence (IQ) but work memory was like 95 lol (slightly below average)
It’s a massive difference with medications for me and I’m still sad I did not get them before I started and failed at university.
"Mr college degree here, i did poor in school, terrible on sats, could only make it into a small private college that just wanted my money, had to take remedial classes that i could not pass, only to fail out......next college i tested out everything, go figure"
I'd get As and Bs but always fall asleep in class
" 
Or ditch classes, bc it was so f'n BORING"
" 
A behavior problem?  
Or utter FAILURE of the education system to realize not all kids are the same or learn the same?  
Rhetorical question"
" 
OBVIOUSLY."
Stufy indeed!
"I scored high the 2nd time I was diagnosed with ADHD, though I feel like IQ only measure a certain area of intelligence"
Caption obvious
"With an IQ of 131, I had to correctly diagnose ADHD at age 38 on my own."
I am 21 and got diagnosed only recently
"I remember taking a ""professional"" (it was some sort of specialist who tested me) IQ test and somehow everyone was convinced I was autistic but they didn't actually want to test me because my mother feared a wrong test result (don't ask me about that logic)"
ADHD was never even an idea until my friend who has ADD said I might have it when I was 20.
Pretty much
"I was lucky, my friend got diagnosed while being screened for something else, and we've always been quite similar in ways that I now chalk largely up to very similar ADHD (and autism)"
"So when I started seeing lots of posts about ADHD, they all seemed alarmingly familiar, and…"
"This isn't really new information, there's been several papers on this topic already"
Nice to have another one regardless.
Yeah I have a high iq (around 120 I think) and was diagnosed with adhd yesterday (I'm 19)
I was so good at confirming everyone just thought I was lazy.
Diagnosed at 30
Never once occurred to me while in school that I had adhd.
me getting diagnosed after messing up my MSc thesis🚶‍♂️
"if i could go back in time to talk to younger me, i would tell her to start going hog wild because clearly that gets results and help"
"This checks out for me, at least anecdotally"
I was diagnosed at 31
"I sought treatment for what was simply an inability to maintain organization, or stick with certain jobs/tasks that had any degree of tedium (to simplify)"
I did this on the recommendation of friends in the medical field
"I was not administered a proper IQ test at my appointment, but I was told I  was able to remain generally functional due to a likely above average IQ"
"Further, in high school I was part of very rigid and structured programs in a small school - the problems manifested after I had become an adult and that structure was removed from my day-to-day life"
"I wish I had realized this 10 years ago, but onward and upwards"
"I'm sure there are many people in the same boat, and I wish you all the best!"
"At least for me, with good grades at school and masking all the time, people (including myself) have never treated my problems seriously"
Even my girlfriend who thinks I have mental health issues did not think about ADHD
I was diagnosed last week
Diagnosis was quick and easy as my counsellor deals with high IQ ADHD adults all the time
I can confidently say that I am on the more stupid side among her clients.
![gif](giphy|IVhivwuUT16HH7NRdP|downsized)
I got ADHD at Seven and I have an above average IQ.

This is me
"Ace tests, do no homework"
"I once told a teacher at the beginning of the year if they would just tell me homework was about obeying and not about learning, I would do my homework"
"Of course she didn’t so I spent the whole year doing barely anything, but I got an A on the mid year and an A- on the final exam"
"She told me she had to fail me because Homework was such a high percentage of the grade, that even though I aced the exams, I still had a failing grade"
And that’s when I got to show her that I was right and she just wouldn’t admit it
"Well, my mom is gonna be really surprised to find out she's black"
"I got diagnosed in my 50s, does that mean I am a genius? Spoiler, not even eligible for Mensa"
"Another ""You're not living up to your potential."" ""If you would just try harder."" ""Why won't you just apply yourself?"" all through my childhood"
Stopped doing my math homework in 7th grade after my math teacher wouldn't let me take the test to get into pre-Algebra
"""You don't need it; you will get married and have children."" Whut??? Still aced all the tests"
He always announced who got the highest grade and I know it had to have burned his ass to have it be me
Ended up with him for 8th grade math
Same
Pretty much stopped doing homework in all my classes then (and all through high school) and still aced tests
My high school graduation ranking was 119 out of 121
Fast forward 30 years later I am finally diagnosed with ADHD.
I believe it
I had an IQ test in High School for my IEP for College and it came out to 124
But when getting diagnosed with things starting in 3rd grade it was my Dysgraphia that the teacher caught first with my bad spelling
"Then, the road led to Dyslexia and ADHD-PI being noticed."
This is a really thoughtfully designed study and is quite easy to read (in comparison with many psychological studies where the text can be … dense)
"The effect size if relatively small by the looks of it, but nonetheless it’s inarguably there"
"For anyone who wasn’t diagnosed until much later in life, this provides some further explanation."
IQ in the 140+ range
Didn’t get diagnosed until my late 30’s
Things rings correct.
"I got ADHD diagnosis at 32, 137 IQ 😅"
well damn im never gonna be diagnosed properly at this rate lets be real
Teasing my husband about this because he was very hyperactive as a child and diagnosed at age 4
I wasn’t diagnosed until 28
Clearly I’m much smarter than he is ;)
"I had the same thing play out every time I got a new teacher.

I'd forget to do my homework all the time"
 I'd be constantly berated for it
" Then ~ 2-3 months into the year, we'd have a test, I'd get the highest score in the class, and they'd chill for the rest of the year.

Love ya mom, and I turned out alright, but sometimes I wonder what would have been if I could have actually lived up to my potential in high school "
The really unfortunate truth is that being really smart does help a person navigate their symptoms
The world just tells them they have to do it a certain way which is completely wrong
Do it how you gotta do it.
If you did your school like you play video games you would be so successful

"Ugh, I hate this"
"

I had one teacher pull me aside and give me the whole “potential” speech and said she was afraid I was going to end up working at McDonalds for the rest of my life"
"I’ll have her know I only ended up working in restaurants for like 14 years 🙃

My high school trigonometry teacher pulled me aside because I doing very poorly in her class because I wasn’t turning in homework"
"So, I forced myself to do it for a semester and got the highest grade in the class"
"I then went back to being useless for the rest of the year, but did well enough in that semester to avoid failing outright"
"

It’s crazy that I never put two and two together until I was in my mid 30’s."

That's kinda bizarre
"I scored highly on most sections of it, but mine clearly showed a huge working memory deficit and they were just like ""yep it's ADHD"""
"So, you're going to suffer.."
but you're going to be happy about it.
"And as we know, anxiety and depression are downstream of ADHD…"
Mine kept telling me it was all anxiety...
"yes, from not being diagnosed til I was almost 50!"
Same happened to me
I'm almost 40 and still looking for an official diagnosis
I got evaluated and the doc said its just depression even though I've been on anti-depressants for 4 years.
Same thing happened to me as a kid
Scored very high on the WISC

Yeah I got diagnosed at 41 when my IQ finally dropped into single digits
"I want to say my life all makes sense now but I'm too dumb to understand anything, like where I left my damn sunglasses."
I'm 30 and in the process of getting a diagnosis
I feel dumber every day. 
Are you me? My dumpster fire 20s was probably harmful to my IQ.
my theory is that high IQ helps you phone it in and skate when presented with things you need to learn or do that normal people would require a lot of focus so the lack of focus doesn't play as much of a role
I was scored several times by professionals both as a child and as an adult very high and was able to use it to get into MENSA (which is a giant scam)
"I was also diagnosed ADHD at a young age, but I was able to spend a good part of my life un-medicated due to this effect"
"In college I could get an A or B in most classes by just scanning the text book, pumping out some papers last minute and basically phoning it in"
It was only later in life when I realized I was doing it all on hard mode for no reason that I got medicated and since then it has been wildly better.

Is this part of having ADHD? Because it's something that happens to me a lot.
I don't know

Because it’s so fresh it knows what *should* be there

now 20 years later I found that test again while looking through my old documents and it motivated me to finally pursue a diagnosis"
"No, I know a kid that was diagnosed at age 4"
They skipped a grade in elementary school
IQ testing itself has come under scrutiny lately.
Same bestie 💓 ngl I kinda wish there was different sub for those of us diagnosed as kidz
I was diagnosed as a kid while in the gifted program! The psych who ran the eval told my parents I was very smart! I also failed a bunch of my high school classes and later failed out of college
IQ is BS and we all contain multitudes.
I wouldn’t jump to that conclusion
I was diagnosed at 9 and the psychiatrist that diagnosed me said my IQ is above average
My ADHD was just severe enough to be spotted that early
But sometimes I do feel like the IQ test results were a mistake haha.
same 😞
Same lol

"Nah, it just means your point discrepancies in your score may have been more blatant and skewed your final ""IQ"" number"

In hindsight, it's so goddamn obvious"
"But everyone around me just focused on how that was evidence for how smart I was, not for how slow I process things and how easily I get distracted."
The higher socioeconomic status got me

"“You’re not that hurt, you’re just drug seeking! I know you folks are a hardy bunch, able to work in the fields or on the job site all day!”, “He doesn’t have any mental health issues, his kind is just a bunch of trouble makers and thugs"
Who are also drug seekers!”
How did you seek a professional like this out? 
This article is about some actual research confirming what we all already know
So its *dr* obvious
:P
"For me, homework and tests were both factored into grades in a lot of classes"
" 
So in ones without homework, I'd get As  
Ones with homework I'd get Cs or Fs"
My own advisor/math teacher tried to get me kicked out of school lol
What a fucking prick
"I'd always take the class syllabus and figure out what portion of the grade was homework and participation, so I knew the bare minimum that I had to do to pass the class"
"Despite always being in the GATE program, and almost all honors and AP classes, I had a solid 2.0GPA.

It drove my mom absolutely bonkers that I never did my homework"
For a few years in high school she found out that the school could do weekly progress reports where you'd have to take a paper to each teacher and they'd leave a note to your parents about the week
"I can't tell you how many ""Does good on tests, hasn't turned any homework"" comments I got.

I made it into community college, where I quickly was placed on academic probation for being dropped from too many classes"
"My crowning achievement in college was me taking a programming class, and going to the first day of class, then not going again, realizing just before the final that I'd be kicked out of school if I didn't pass the class, going back and taking the final, and getting the highest grade in the class lol."
I was the same way I would blow off all homework and then pull off a high passing score on the tests to maintain a decent grade average.
drove my teachers nuts
"Yup, I was notorious in my High School because I would sleep through most of class and then be in the top 10%"
"I remember one time I was asleep in physics class, the teacher slammed a textbook on my desk to wake me up and then asked “What’s the law of conservation of mass?” I just looked at him and said “uh, matter can’t be created or destroyed just change forms” and he went “oh… alright” and went back to teaching class, while I went back to my nap lol"
"Apparently he’d been asking the class that question and no one else knew the answer, so when I got it right he just didn’t know what to do."
"See, I think what helped me in the end was I copied homework a LOT"
"It was never me not wanting to do it so I copied, it was me getting to class, the teacher bringing up the homework, and me realizing I completely forgot it existed"
"I really didn’t think I did it THAT much, but not too long ago a friend brought up how much I used to copy hers and I just didn’t remember it being so frequent"
"Then like you, I’d have no problem with the tests so it worked out"
"The only thing that makes me feel a little better is that I did graduate magna cum laude with my Masters degree, during which time I NEVER copied anyone’s homework lol"
" I didn’t get diagnosed with ADHD until I was 35, so I think this supports that theory"
"

I also grew up with a dad who firmly believed impulsiveness, “laziness”, forgetfulness, etc were simply character flaws and I just wasn’t trying hard enough and wasn’t disciplined enough like he was, so there was no chance of my parents ever getting me help"
It took severe depression and years of blowing it off until I finally decided to go to the doctor and got my diagnosis.
"Kyle, by any chance?"
K as in kid? 😰
Gods I remember my 4th grade teacher delighted in tormenting me
She would single me out in front of the class for things like reading aloud— it wasn’t my vocabulary that was the issue! My reading level was really high as a kid
"My eyes would get ahead of my mouth and I’d stumble over words and then the whole damn class would laugh at me, like they didn’t do the exact damn thing"
"Some of them couldn’t even read aloud at that age, yet I’m the one that got singled out because the teacher had a vendetta against me for some reason"
"

When I’d get upset or overstimulated she would lean over my desk and leer at me, “do you want me to email your mother? No? Then behave.” She was awful"
She never should’ve been a teacher and I never should’ve been placed in her class just because I was “smart”.
"In HS, I started completing my assignments before the end of the school day"
"I knew that if I waited to get home, it would never get done."
I had a pre calc teacher my junior year throw up her hands and tell the entire class “Well I don’t get it
"You guys NEVER do your homework but you ace all these tests, so from here on out any homework you do will be extra credit instead.” We felt rather victorious lol."
"I think about that all the fucking time.

If my disability had been treated seriously sooner and not blown off because ""girls don't get ADHD!"" then I might have had something resembling a happy life"
"An education, a career, who knows? This world wasn't made for how my brain works and it's frustrating."
Masking 101
This! Why can’t I hyperfixate on something useful/productive?
How is it that you can focus on video games but not on your homework? Stop making excuses for your laziness.
And..? Which one did you become?
Why are we all the same person?
"So uh, what did your therapist have to say about that? 

Signed, middle aged guy in the same boat."

The smartest people I've ever known were also the most depressed people I've known
"For me, they were “Depression +”"
The only thing they did was cause me to become obese and erectile dysfunction
2 things known to make a man feel his best! /s
"I'm laughing because someone once got so excited about helping me, and said, ""Hold on! I'm going to print something out that I know will totally help you!"" and they came back with a blank monthly calendar page, grinning like they just solved my life's problems! ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)"
Same! I did very well in all categories except working memory where I was just average
The memory dip was so big compared to the other scores that they diagnosed me with ADHD straight away
Normally you'd expect somewhat consistent scores across the different tests.
"Same! Before my diagnosis, everything was super high (80-97 percentiles), except for an average working memory"
"

When I spoke to other adhd friends they also had super high scores, except for working memory"
Some even had below average working memories
There may be bias because everyone is an educated working professional doing above average (but not necessarily doing very amazing)
"

In my head a lot of adhd folks are geniuses who can only work in spurts and for a limited time! Which sadly does not work the best to meet the needs of most jobs."
Exactly the same! Scored in the 96th percentile but working memory was average
The difference was so big that the diagnosis went very fast after that!
Yup
Did ok in school
I was in high ability in elementary but then in high school my grades got progressively shittier as time went on
"When I was in elementary school, things were easy but in high school and college (before I dropped out), I never did well because I would have actually had to have studied and tried"
"I had never developed structure or discipline because things always came easy to me.

I finally got diagnosed last year when I was 39"
"The first day after I was prescribed medication I was reading in my living room with my husband and I said, “omg, I can read without getting distracted and not have to reread entire pages"
Is this how normal people’s brains work?!?!”
51! :) 
Yup
There were multiple things at school I wanted to do but couldn't because of the costs or because it meant my single mother would have to drive me to places before and after school
She was never able to due to my other siblings so I never got to join any clubs or do any extra curricular activities
"

I also didn't run for school captain or any other position like that as it meant extra time at school before and after the school busses so I had no way of getting to the school for it.

I also couldn't afford to go on most excursions or camps so I missed out on this opportunities too."
I think they age adjust it so you compare yourself with your own age cohort
So probably we got dumber but so did everyone else lol.
"When I'm sending an important email, I schedule it for a little later like 10 minutes to an hour or so"
After I press the send button I can see my mistakes so much clearer and can edit if needed
And if it's fine then it gets sent when I'm already distracted so I won't sit there stressing as much
"As with all things ADHD, YMMV."
"I don't know if it's ""officially"" part of ADHD"
"I'm pretty newly diagnosed, and there's still more that I don't know than that I do"
But it makes sense to me that it should be part of it
"

I can re-read something as many times as I want, if I'm ""re-reading"" but my brain is actually off in a thousand other places how many mistakes am I likely to catch? 

Now add in the fact that because I wrote the thing I know what I intended to say"
"So while I'm wondering what's for dinner and what that sound was and what's the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow all at the same time while I ""re-read"" the thing, I'm often seeing what *should be* there rather than what *is.* This is why, although I just generally suck at reviewing things, I find way more mistakes when I'm doing a cold-eyes review of someone else's work than when I proofread my own"
It's not that my work is better - it's not - but because I'm not familiar with what the other person was trying to say I can't run through it on memory.
I wouldn't just assume so
"Like it seems like it could make sense, but then on the other hand, I've always felt like nearly everyone is terrible at noticing typos"
"For some reason I seem to notice them MORE than most people.

Maybe it's less of an attention thing and more about how your brain processes written words?"
"Yes, rereading and not comprehending is an ADHD trait"
 Like the words are beads and you are just sliding them through your hands without looking at them
" You know they are there, you see them, and they just pass through your mind without leaving any knowledge."
That could be dyslexia
But they are all interlinking
"

Statically If your dyslexic you have 80% change of ADHD and 30% chance of ASD"
"(It was hard not to shout out ""bingo!' during that workshop) 

Don't know what the odds are if your ADHD of having dyslexia."
This is how I live my life
That is facinating
"I always felt that I had a very good work ethic, but I think my inability to focus made me very frustrated with the quality of my work for a long time"
Getting medicated has helped me significantly with the quality of my work
I wish I'd sought out help so much sooner.
"I also think my mom was just super observant in my behavior very early on than more parents would be, which led to the diagnosis"
Maybe someone less aware would write it off as just being “hyper”
"Seriously, fuck them"
"I think they might have thought that if they shame people like us enough, then we would magically start performing better? I wonder when in their career as an educator they lost their fucking humanity and empathy 🤔"
As will mine
"

🫂"
"Damn, those teachers are angels"
"I remember the teachers from K-12 who really went out of their way, even when it did not benefit them, and they could’ve chosen to push me aside / push me through if they wanted and everyone would take their side, they still did it."
"1) I knew women in those fields who were either public about having ADHD (orwho  I was pretttttty confident did), and asked if they would be willing to recommend their/a provider.

2) At the time, I was an attorney and our state bar had a.."
"crisis intervention program, for lack of a better way to phrase it, so I reached out and asked them if they had a shortlist of providers they recommended."
I had a teacher that counted notes as 80% and tests as 20% of your grade
 I had a 20 in the class
" 100% on all tests, 0% on notes."
That reminds me of a math class I had in highschool
Tests were worth 95% of the grade
Daily assignments were only worth 5%
"I aced the tests, so I never bothered with the daily work"
"Then towards the end of the semester my teacher got fed up with me and I had to go to detention every afternoon for a couple weeks to catch up on all of the daily work.

He was my favorite teacher though"
"I'm not sure if he was a gambler, but he loved probability and talked about it in terms of gambling very often"
I still have and cherish a book by Oswald Jacoby (who he spoke of often) on gambling odds that I bought while in his class some 30 odd years ago.
"My grades were very much feast or famine, if I actually did the work and did so on time A."
I had a math teacher try to remove me from her class.  She was mad that I didn't pay attention in class or turn in homework.  She thought I was cheating since I aced every test.  And since the tests were most of our grade I still had a B.
Had a nursing professor try to kick me out because I didn’t go to class
But said they couldn’t because I was one of two people who had an A lmao
Also had a 98% in if the hardest nursing classes and they dropped be to an 88% because 10% of the grade was attendance
So stupid
"I don't remember making this alt account and posting my life story, huh."
My chemistry/physics teacher was impressed.  He said he never had a student not do labs or homework and still get a C.  He would bring the lowest test score up to a 60.  He would adjust everyones score the same amount.  I always ended up with like 130% on my tests.
"He said it was Keith, but to everyone else it was kiddy Fiddler"
" Except for my Russian friend who thought everyone was saying kidney, but he really enjoyed kidney Fiddler so nobody had the heart to tell him."
That’s definitely part of it.
Because it’s not stimulating enough
Because you control the variables and the outcome has strict rules
This was my whole childhood in a nutshell
"I ended up in care, taken away from my parents got in loads of trouble as a kid, but once an adult I created a business from scratch that 30 years later is still running (I have nothing to do with it anymore)"
So in some ways I am a failed criminal and successful business person
😎
"That a lot of my adult issues - hyperfocusing on otherwise trivial stuff, escapism, living in a fantasy world, feeling overwhelmed by anything that has to be done a specific way with nobody willing to discuss the reasoning - may stem from that"
"Low self esteem, too"
"Being told things like ""just because you got the right answer, doesn't mean you did it right"" and constantly getting mediocre grades for skipping the process and not showing my work.

It led me to an adulthood where I feel like a failure to live up to some otherworldly potential, makes me question myself constantly and clash with rigid thinkers, but also makes me almost desperate to win their approval because then I would be the ""right"" kind of smart.

Didn't really end up with a resolution so much as a revelation, but it's a big step."
"I feel like butter robot at work.  I can do so much and have potential for more.


Boss: Clean epoxy out of these pipes.
Me: Heres is my plan and budget to prevent these pipes from getting contaminated ever again.
Boss: Clean epoxy out of these pipes."
They don’t call ignorance bliss for no reason
Sadhguru says a sharp intellect is like a sharp knife
"You want a sharp knife but it is a tool, if used wrongly than you can make more damage than with a dull intellect"
Still fighting that weight off 17 years later
"Damn new set ppint from meds.


Thing is I was depressed & highly anxious. 


They didn't ask why..."
Ohh the rescuers
I’ve had a fair share of them as well
"Bless their heart but unless that paper is pressed in vyvanse, it wont be helping me.

A tip:

If I’m feeling extra annoyed that day, my inner Chandler comes out"
"So, I usually grab my phone and say, “Hold on, this is too important,” while frantically tapping away at the screen"
"When they ask, “What are you doing?” I reply, “I’m trying to find the number for the Nobel Committee—because you just cured ADHD.”

From then on, they keep their mumbo-jumbo to themselves🤗"
Me too
"My math retrieval score (math facts, quickly) was 5 standard deviations lower than my math knowledge score (real math questions)"
Working memory was 3 lower than knowledge
I still only got diagnosed at 12 because I did well until middle school.
"Tomorrow may be that day for me.


51 & newly diagnosed. 


Anything else to share about the calm? It's hard to envision. "
GenX fist bump!
Are you medicated now at all?
"This is indeed a great tip! It's apparently the approach I have to take from now on, since all the work I do I tend to send it to my boss (we work from home) by WhatsApp."
Dows this still requires you to manually go into your sent items folder to review?
Clever!!
Yeah this is pretty spot on
"I miss words here and there, swear it’s almost worse medicated"
"When I proofread, it’s like my brain inserts the word I miss, even if it’s not there"
So I ‘see’ it and don’t catch the fact it’s not really there
Weird.
">I don't know if it's ""officially"" part of ADHD"
"I'm pretty newly diagnosed, and there's still more that I don't know than that I do"
But it makes sense to me that it should be part of it
"

In fact, I am newly diagnosed with ADHD as well (around six months), and I'm still in that process of getting to know my condition and how it has affected me"
I'm acknowledging as well that maybe I'm in some sort of grief (?)
"There are many answers and many things that now make sense but many questions as well.

>I can re-read something as many times as I want, if I'm ""re-reading"" but my brain is actually off in a thousand other places how many mistakes am I likely to catch? 

>Now add in the fact that because I wrote the thing I know what I intended to say"
"So while I'm wondering what's for dinner and what that sound was and what's the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow all at the same time while I ""re-read"" the thing, I'm often seeing what should be there rather than what is"
"This is why, although I just generally suck at reviewing things, I find way more mistakes when I'm doing a cold-eyes review of someone else's work than when I proofread my own"
"It's not that my work is better - it's not - but because I'm not familiar with what the other person was trying to say I can't run through it on memory.

Yes, I can relate to all this"
"Like I've said to other commentary, I tend to verify like three or more times if the work I did fulfills with all, and if it is in a great stage"
"But no matter the times I check it, it always tend to go with some error that or my boss notices, or myself notice when it's already sent"
It's annoying.
"""what's the airspeed of an unladen swallow"" - I relate hard to this, you made me laugh, thanks"
Though you can also be hyperlexic and have ADHD
The funny thing is that this doesn't happen to me just with texts
"For example, I work as architect with 3d modellings and renders; and I swear that I tend to make many mistakes unwittingly, even if I have a list and if I check everything like three or four times"
"I used to shrug it off by saying that this is something that happens to everyone, but my boss has scolded me around three times this year by saying that ""he can't be checking if I do a correct work when he's got no time and has to be aware of what's my coworkers do as well"""
"

 My compensatory mechanism has been to be perfectionist with my work and with everything, but it's annoying that still there are errors that somehow can pass through; even if I, again, check everything three or more times."
"Umm but Google tells me it's a 30% chance of ADHD, not 80%?"
Nice
"Also, any advice for someone with ADHD thinking of applying to law school? I was recently laid off in an unrelated industry, and am thinking of taking this time to make a big career switch"
I am aware I have a (self inflicted) uphill battle
"Well, for me it's not really hill, it's more like Mt"
Everest
"But now that I am older, have professional experience and am more mature and understand myself better, I know I can do anything if I can put my mind to it."
"I've had a class where I showed up and did everything in the class, but got 0% because of not completing one out of school assignment.

The school system is set up to make kids fail."
I had a teacher who had notes set as (I can't remember) somewhere between 50% to 80% of the grade
"Thank goodness, I was able to make a deal with him that as long as my test grades were high 90's, he wouldn't check my notes"
Absolutely saved my grade.
Papers destroy me! The sitting there and thinking conceptually about things… no… I can’t think like a spider web
I need a monorail and then I can maybe stay on task.
This mentality amongst teachers is without question why so many people with undiagnosed ADHD/ASD become rebellious towards school and wind up absolutely hating the education system
"

I was the same as many of you, always dominated on tests, never did homework"
But homework being like 20-30% of my grade in every class resulted in me being a C/D student constantly riding the line between passing and failing
"Three times in high school I had a teacher give us a ""test study guide"" for our final exam, that we were told wasn't going to be graded"
Only to turn around on the day of the test and announce it was actually going to be 50% of the grade on the final
"

I could never understand how it made logical sense to treat homework as part of a grade"
"Sure, if the homework was a project or paper, that makes sense"
"But when I'm getting 100s on every math test, it seems pretty ridiculous to insist that I do busy work at home"
My opinion has always been that the nightly homework stuff should be purely optional
It should be there for kids who need extra practice and assistance
"

I learn incredibly easily and incredibly quick"
Unless I feel like I'm being forced into doing something just for the sake of doing it
"Then my brain basically goes into a flight or fight response and I say fuck it, I'll do nothing then"
But if I'm teaching myself something? It's a breeze
I'll literally hyper focus on a topic for a few weeks/months until I feel like I have the level of understanding I need to be proficient
"

It's actually been an amazing skill as I've become an adult with a home, spouse, kids etc as I apply this same ability to things like child/relationship psychology, fixing stuff around the house, money management and investing etc"
"I'm far from an expert at anything, but I'm an intermediate at everything I care enough to learn."
not unheard of for GATE kept types
Luckily I started hyper-fixating on video production and editing and now I get paid to do it
Because you deep down don’t want to do it
And instant feedback
Thank you very much for the reply
I hope it can steer you towards feeling more comfortable in your own skin and satisfied with your own life and situation
"

For what it's worth, I feel exactly the same way you do, and it sounds like we struggle with many of the same issues"
"

I think it's one thing to learn how to not compare yourself or your success against your peers, but it's a whole other kettle of fish to learn how to accept the life you have and not compare yourself to some idealized version of your own mythical potential self.
 
Thanks again, wishing you all the best."
Sounds like a good opportunity to offer consultant services to businesses with similar issues.
I got diagnosed at 33
"Not sure how I made it this far 😂

I am good at grasping and visualizing math concepts but I am basically useless for making calculations on the spot"
"I can visualize intricate 3D objects in my mind, make them interact, etc"
but make me do a very simple multiplication and I'll struggle
It's nuts.
Hahaha! Respect!
Yes I'm on dexamphetamine but it's not as effective as I'd hoped it would be
I want to try Vyvanse but it's $110 a month compared to $18 for the dex.
"Noooo! I start meds soon. 


I want spelling ""back"""
The ADHD is bad right now :)
You’re welcome
I’m glad you enjoyed 🙂
Yup
I just read the web MD description of hyperlexia and felt seen
 I could read before I talked
"Speed reader, like 100-120 pages an hour"
"Full retention of what I read at that speed, as long as a normal book"
Poetry and philosophy require slower speed
" I switched to adult-level books at age 9, like Dune, so skipped over all the youth/ teen fiction my classmates were reading"
 I have read at least a book a week for fun my entire life.
This is interesting! I would definitely read more about it since I didn't know about this term until now.
Srsly..
youre gonna pick out a typo - he just mentioned that he got the stats mixed up because of Dyslexia
It's also set up to teach kids how to memorize and take tests
The system is not enhancing actual learning
I can totally relate to the brain going into fight or flight
I am currently working on becoming a math teacher and I think homework is often given as a chance for the kids who won’t do well on a test to keep their grades up
I also think teachers don’t know how to best assess their students
They might think someone is cheating if they never do any work and then ace the tests
I already see this in students
We did a huge project in class and a student with an IEP was gone for over a week but when I was asking the class questions who do you think had all the answers?! I am trying to decide how I will grade homework in the future
It’s not equitable! Not everyone has a parent at home who can help or money for a tutor
"And, like you said, some kids just don’t need the ‘extra practice.’ And it’s not fair to punish them for that."
"I mean, this is true hahaha

What is it called when you don’t want to do anything at all?!"
"How exactly deep down? Rock bottom of human psyche deep down, where no body wants to do anything? There are a lot of stuff that i know are good for me, i know i enjoy, i enjoyed them last time, i feel good about them, etc etc, but wouldn’t be able to get up and do them."
"Are you in the US? I was put on Dex first, now I got some  Vyvanse to try, only 30mg, so it doesn’t do much"
"
My sleep was always bad so if I take too much Dex or too late, after 12pm, my sleep is impacted and I feel tired next day"
Even 30mg Vyvanse last too long
"
My son just got diagnosed 2 days ago and got Ritalin, so I gave it a go in the last 2 days"
"10mg didn’t do too much yesterday, today I took 20mg and now I feel sick and nauseous"
"I can’t win ☹️
Before I was diagnosed I managed to get Bupropion (Wellbutrin) XL"
I loved it
I felt better instantly and it improved my concentration
Unfortunately I got paradoxical sexual side-effects so I stopped it
Guanfacine also helped but I stopped it for the same reason
"
I literally tried every medication as I could get most of it from overseas"
I’m in Australia btw
"It’s manageable for me, just different"
"It’s like when I recall something I lost, if my memory image is off (color mostly, but shape, size, etc), I won’t see the damn thing if it is sitting right in front of me."
"Where?

OP should correct their original statement then."
Depression
"I'm also Australian, in Australia :)

I tried Ritalin as a kid but it made me sleep within half an hour of taking it haha"
That tracks
"Well, I got Ritalin a few years ago from a doctor friend"
I didn't know I had ADHD back than and it made me very sleepy so I tried a few times and it did the same
It means that we definitely have ADHD as our brain calms down and then realizes that we are very tired
It could go away if you find the right dose and enough rest
Having said that I got some Concerta in Croatia and it didn't do too much except no appetite and insomnia
Even when I took the maximum dose
" 
Vyvanse for a $100? I paid $60 for both Ritalin and Vyvance two days ago"
Maybe it's more expensive for higher doses
"Did you try to get it recently? The price might have changed because the patent expired in the US last year, so they already have generics"
They still have a valid patent here
" 
I'm currently experimenting with supplements and vitamins such as L-tyrosine, B1/B6, creatine etc"
" 
I'm in Adelaide, male 49"
If you're a female it might not work depending on the cycle.

There’s nothing wrong with letting your doctor know the medication isn’t working for you
"I stated in Ritalin 10mg 3 x daily and after a week I said I wasn’t enjoying taking something 3 times a day, the highs and lows of instant release were also unpleasant.

I’ve changed to Concerta 36mg and I’m having some bad side affects with that too so I’m going to ask to try Vyvanse when I speak to him next week"
"

This process isn’t a one size fits all and you should feel confident to explain how it’s making you feel"
I really would recommend cutting down on caffeine though it can really interact badly with methylphenidate.
Are you still in med/dose adjustment period or is what you are taking the result of that period? Your doctor should be actively monitoring what medication is the most effective for you (a balance of highest benefit with minimal side effects) during the adjustment period
"Even after then, there’s nothing wrong with voicing how you feel and ask how that can be improved"
You could even say you hear about people having better success with different treatments and wondering if that’s relevant to you in his/her expert opinion
"

The key is to not cross into your doctor’s professional domain without forfeiting your patient rights."
Yes I “accidentally” realised how caffeine was making me feel worse with it! I drink maybe half a cup of coffee a day now and I noticed a big difference
"

However still I feel a bit flat on it even though many times focusing is easier"
Today was the first day time I spent with my partner in a while
"(he also has adhd and is on another medicine for years)And, he observed that I still look like I have raging ADHD, maybe slightly less physically hyperactive on certain moments…"
I am taking it for two months now…I don’t know if I am still in the adjustment period
"(How long that is you think?)

I cut caffeine recently after realising one day that I had to be outside the whole day while the only coffee place there was out of beans, I felt way better overall"
"

However, I still cannot rate my experience as a nice one with meds"
"I eliminated the crash I think and my mood is not super low however, I feel a bit less motivated and a bit less interested in life than before when I was unmediated"
"Also, I still struggle with  waking up, getting ready, leaving my house and being on time for the morning classes"
"
My doctor suggested to go a bit down or high with my dose to see if it would be better"
"To me, lower dose without drinking coffee the whole day is not so doable"
I haven’t tried the higher one yet.
"Well if your doctor gave you the freedom to go higher (I assume he advised the mg for it), you should try it"
I think this is your doctor’s way of adjusting the medication dose
"Try to avoid coffee, and no juice or ascorbic acid (vitamin c) around the time you take meds"
(Decreases absorption).
Thank you :)

"Are they diagnosed and treated for it?

Practical tips and systems can sometimes work but because ADHD is an executive function disorder it can also mean that they only work initially but end up just being more hoops for them to jump through and not very effective/have the reverse effect"
"If they're struggling then the best thing to try first is for them to make sure they're on the most effective treatment by speaking to a doctor or specialist about how they're struggling.

Outside of that working something into a routine or directly working with someone on a project helps me the most, but everyone is different of course so you might just have to try a few different things.

I'm sorry if this doesn't help much"
You seem like a nice person to have come here to ask for advice and I hope everything works out in the best way that it can for all of you.
I'd suggest a good organizational tool like [bydesign.io](http://bydesign.io) to help them get control of their lives.
"This is from a credible US organization, CHADD (Children and Adults with ADHD) so not sure how practical it will be for you but I think it’s great primer"
Hope it helps
"

Edit"
Thank you for being supportive.

Is lack of passion in work a common symptom? 
Yes
 I'm 53 and in a position where I mostly have authority to set my own projects and I frequently feel like I’m having a passive aggressive reaction to my own todo list
 I find that the Pomodoro method where I set a timer to work for 25 minutes on a task and then take a 5 minute break (a cycle thst gets repeated four times before taking a longer break) helps
 I also listen to ambient music which I only listen to when I’m doing focus work helps
 I also have a long commute and I do better when I don't flip through songs but instead listen to a podcast helps
" All that to say, yes"
 I love my job and struggle to actually do it.

Pregnant now and unmedicated
I actually started Wellbutrin a few weeks before I found out that I was expecting and my doctor promptly told me to stop taking it
"

Honestly, it’s been hell for me"
Everything is harder
I thought I couldn’t focus before? Somehow my focus is worse now
I can’t remember to take my prenatal vitamins or any other pregnancy related medications (that’s normal but worse since it’s related to the health of my child)
"

I was used to eating once a day because I often forget to eat but now I’m being forced to eat multiple times a day not because I want to but because I literally get sick if I don’t.

I’ve had breakdowns about the fact that deciding what to eat AGAIN is so difficult"
Meal planning does not work bc well I have to plan
"I forget that food is in the fridge so it goes bad and I feel bad bc I’m not cooking due to lack of energy so it’s like adhd tax? Waste of expensive takeout leftovers 😔 Cooking was already adhd difficult for me but now I’m spending and wasting more money than ever on delivery and takeout.

I don’t have the energy to clean in my sporadic, distracted way so the house is even more of a mess and disorganized than it normally would be"
"That goes for my personal hygiene too, I need external reminders to do my body cleanliness because I genuinely forget and somehow the time just keeps passing and I don’t realize it.

I was horrible at remembering to reach out to friends and family before but now I’m drowning in deeper depression and deeper forgetfulness so i’m usually not responding to anyone.

Lastly, I’m pretty stressed about the reality that I could be getting fired because try as I might I can’t seem to get any work done at work"
"I’m behind on all of my deadlines because I can’t focus.

I’m also stressed about how I’m supposed to be an unmedicated parent while breastfeeding.

It’s absolutely hell for me and I don’t ever want to do this again.

(But please take this with the context that I am struggling, I’m also depressed and holding on by a thread so other pregnant people with ADHD may be having a much better time!)"
"I’m pregnant and stayed on Vyvanse, with my psych and obgyn’s approval"
My psychiatrist didn’t even want me off it since I have pretty severe ADHD and being off it would most likely send me into bad depression which would neither be good for me or baby.
"I’m working on getting pregnant, I’m grateful you posted this question"
"
I’ve had one doc say that I could stay on Adderall if it’s going to be bad for me— for example if I can’t work and get fired, can’t raise a baby with no job— she was a female psych"
"
Then I got a second opinion from a male psych and he said he didn’t feel comfortable proscribing it"
That he thought we should work on managing my symptoms
"
I’ve been working with a CBT for 2 years trying to lower my dose and eventually come off of meds so that I can function without them in case I get pregnant"
I’m working on executive functioning skills and trying to make more habits happen now
"It’s going ok, I’m lowering my dose from 30 to 20mg but I also started Zoloft which he  said could easy symptoms by removing anxiety, and eventually i might just stick to zoloft which is safer to take while pregnant …"
im hopeful but nervous either way
I was never pregnant but my psychiatrist gave me this website called embryotox
"I suffer from severe adhd and wanted to be prepared.

You can search for medication or disease"
"(adhd=adhs)

It‘s in German but very informative and worth to translate"
"
When searching for ingredients they also tell you, if there is an alternative or not.

I learned, that one can risk more when giving up on stimulants than by taking them"
"It is helpful to plan my pregnancy and gave me a lot of new aspects to think about.

I hope, this helps you as much as it helped me.

Good luck 🍀"
I was the most unproductive happy couch potato.
I am 34 weeks with my 5th pregnancy
I'm not medicated at all
I was on Ritalin until I got pregnant with my 4th and haven't taken anything since
"

I will say that my SO is super supportive of when I don't have any energy for anything"
"He will pick up my slack with childcare, cooking, and cleaning."
I take Wellbutrin and was given no instruction to stop taking it
My doctors determined the mental health benefits to me outweighed any potential risk.
It was a dream all three times
 I know that's not the general experience but I loved being pregnant
 My mental health was so much better each time
" 

Adhd wasn't even on my radar at that point so I don't know if being on and going off of medication would have made that worse"
" 

I did nearly have to be induced with my youngest for hypertension issues, but i had my two youngest at home and had a very uncomplicated 4 hour labor with my first in the hospital."
I was on adderall when I got pregnant and stopped right when I found out and I was on 40 mg and was on it for 2 years and really with how shitty you feel in the first trimester anyways I did not even notice myself withdrawling because I was just so tired either way
And idk if it was “pregnancy brain” or just myself with out my medicine 🤣 but overall I never craved it and then I am on it again 1 month postpartum
I’m 35 weeks pregnant and have been off meds
It’s been hard but I’ve been determined to make it work
I’ve been really surprising myself and making it work
I was so nervous to go off my meds but you kinda just do it when you know you’re doing it for the baby
Idk
That’s my experience
"I have inattentive adhd and I work from home which has been huge because I rely a lot on being comfy, breaks, and naps."
"I haven't been on medicine in years, but I recently had a baby, and I feel like everything was normal during pregnancy but since I feel like I have lost my marbles"
Worse than ever
Some days are worse than others.
"One of the big reasons I'm considering not having children is because I have such a hard time eating a healthy array of foods, I'm sure that's important during pregnancy and I'm not sure I could be successful without medication"
I didn't go on Adderall until after my daughter (now 17 months) was born
I'm planning on #2 next year and dreading giving up Adderall.
I went off all meds before conceiving
"Pregnancy (after the first 12 weeks) was fantastic: I felt great, I looked great…but postpartum was a bit of a nightmare"
"Be careful reinstating any SSRIs several months post: I ended up with Serotonin Syndrome (even on a low dose), and that sucked azz"
"

Good luck to you!!"
"I have been raw doggin life since my parents “didn’t want a drugged up kid” and the drs don’t believe me as an adult.
Anyway, I rely heavily on antidepressants generally and had to go cold turkey and take nothing, I was super worried.
It was the best I’ve felt emotionally/mentally in years, if my hospital experience (the staff and things available in hospital) wasn’t so traumatic I probably would have had several more kids."
"I was diagnosed in HS, took nothing for either pregnancy"
"It’s pregnancy, it’s hard- mentally and physically"
"Seriously, your emotions are everywhere and your brain is fuzzy"
That’s it
"If you were only recently diagnosed, then you haven’t been on anything your whole life"
You’ll handle it & then you’ll have a baby & your brain won’t understand life anymore anyway haha
"I didn’t get formally diagnosed till I was postpartum and still haven’t started meds, but pregnancy was rather uneventful"
"Did I struggle with my normal adhd traits? yes, but as far as pregnancy goes it was pretty mild"
"The things that got ramped up for me were hormigones, so my response to my issues, not the issues themselves"
Granted I could’ve just forgotten 🤷‍♀️ pregnancy/mom brain is real
But I did manage to take a difficult chemistry and physics class and pass them both while in my 2nd/3rd trimester
Brain fog was worst around the halfway point
"Keeping moving as much as possible, eating, and staying hydrated helped the most"
Really just needed to shift expectations and focus on the basics
Struggling more now with executive function things and trying to be productive again now that we’re 9 months out.
"I wasn’t on any medication for ADHD before I was pregnant with both of my children, but was absolutely ADHD, however, other than morning sickness, I felt awesome during pregnancy"
"Your body somehow seems to just regulate itself in a great way during this time, at least for me"
 I didn’t feel the ups and downs of periods that we feel each month and it was wonderful
 I think you will do great without the medication during pregnancy if you so choose.
I was very fortunate to have a strong support system
It was hard being yanked off my meds suddenly and seriously impacted my job
But I also was a lot more chill and just let everything else fall where it would and focused on the baby
Breastfeeding didn’t work for us but I stayed off my meds for the first couple of years since I had quit working and just focused on the kid
I had to go back on meds when he started talking because I couldn’t remember what I was doing every time he spoke to me
":(

Being a stay at home mom was tough with no external schedule"
We’d have never made it if my husband wasn’t the world’s steadiest person.
I chose to stop my Adderall/Vyvanse when I got pregnant this time
"I had an early miscarriage the cycle before and while I don’t think my meds had anything to do with it, I didn’t want to take any risks"
I was so nauseous and exhausted the first trimester anyway I just wanted to be asleep as much as possible
"

Then I discussed it with my OB"
"She was okay with me taking it as needed, with a plan to have a growth scan at 32 and 36 weeks to make sure it wasn’t impacting baby’s growth at all"
"Also, the plan was to stop taking it in the last month of pregnancy"
"Apparently babies may experience withdrawal symptoms after birth, so our plan is to wean off of them while still pregnant.

However, I’ve only wanted to take them two days this whole pregnancy"
I have the advantage that I’m a SAHM to two school-aged kids
So the laundry and dishes may not get done on time or something but it’s not the end of the world over here
"If I had a job, I’d probably be taking it more often."
"I was pregnant before I was diagnosed, so unmedicated for both"
" Pregnancy brain in the 3rd trimester was no joke, but for my first pregnancy, my life was overall simpler and my ADHD wasn’t an issue because I understood the assignment: eat well, work, save money"
 I didn’t really have time or energy for anything else
"

2nd pregnancy was harder because I was looking after a high-needs toddler (who was later also diagnosed with ADHD) and had wicked morning sickness"
" The brain fog set in earlier, I think because I was already burning out."
It was hell 💁🏻‍♀️ but I didn't know I had ADHD back then
After pregnancy and having a baby symptoms just blow to the point of no return 🫣
"Honestly I felt like my symptoms were reduced while I was pregnant, and I was not medicated leading up to the pregnancy"
Postpartum was a nightmare though with the hormones
I ended up on meds for the first time since grade school.
I was diagnosed while trying to get pregnant and haven’t tried ADHD meds yet
"I found my ADHD symptoms diminished during pregnancy, except for extreme fatigue during the first trimester"
"The postpartum hormone crash hit big, though"
"I was in a major fog basically until recently when I started a GLP-1 drug, which has made my brain so quiet it’s amazing."
There have been at least two studies that have found that the risk of taking ADHD stimulant meds during pregnancy is pretty low
Talk to you prescribing doc and OB/GYN about it.
I was unmedicated for mine
"The first trimester I was so unbelievably tired I would come home and crash, but that seems true for most people"
"After I got my energy back, I had 'pregnancy brain"" x2 .."
"I forgot my own zip code at one point, a few times I would be standing at the stove for 30 minutes wondering why something wasn't cooking only to realize I never turned the damn stove on."
I’m also pregnant with unmedicated adhd and only surviving because of my mother in law who takes care of me.
"Just to let you know, you don’t have to be unmedicated while breastfeeding! Or even in most of your pregnancy"
I’m currently 3 months postpartum
Currently on 10mg IR adderall
I was diagnosed when I was a kid and finally got medicated this month since childhood because my life was spiraling out of control with a toddler and a newborn
So far my production has not been impacted plus my baby has seemed totally normal while being medicated
I also know other pregnant women’s with adhd have taken meds while pregnant and stopped like a month before their due date and started back up at around 2-3 months pp
Please talk to your doctor about this to help you! You shouldn’t have to suffer while pregnant/breastfeeding!
To be completely honest I didn’t read every word but basically same
I felt like a zombie mentally
I would fall asleep during work constantly
"I WFH and somehow performed well enough to not lose my job, but I’ve never felt so brain dead and incompetent in my life"
"

Now my baby is 3.5 months old and I feel so much better already"
I experienced PPD - and probably depression during pregnancy too - and did get on antidepressants for a couple weeks after birth but kept forgetting to take them (LOL) and eventually realized I feel fine without them
So I am currently completely unmedicated.
My doctors were the same way
"I read posts like this and get really worried thinking I ruined my baby by taking my medicine, but I had my baby in July and we are both perfectly fine"
I took adderall at the beginning and in the 2nd trimester I switched to Concerta
"I do take a lower dose than I should, so it is still a struggle, but once I am done breastfeeding I’m going to ask for it to be raised."
This is my hope
I’m pregnant and not medicated but now a stay at home parent to two older children and I’m struggling getting things done
I’m getting more moody and more stressed out
I want to go back on meds and try something that will work for me
I wasn’t a fan of vyvanse but think I did better on Ritalin in the short time I had taken that a while back
I’m also curious about guafacine as well.
"Sorry - forgot the link! 

https://www.embryotox.de

ADHD: https://www.embryotox.de/erkrankungen/details/ansicht/erkrankung/aufmerksamkeitsdefizit-hyperaktivitaetsstoerung"
"I was sooooo energetic, but in a calm and collected fashion with my daughter"
"But omfg with my son?! Haha it’s a joke that I became “dragon lady” I blame the testosterone 😜 but truly, pregnancy is so insanely different for each one- even in the same one human womb."
Your post is confusing
"""I'm 35 weeks pregnant and haven't been off meds."" But then you talk about being nervous to go off them?

Are you on or off meds while pregnant?"
I will also be switched to Concerta at 32 weeks and can stay on it while breastfeeding
"I think the cardiovascular side effects wear off as the time passes, and I’ve been on Vyvanse for years"
"At the 20 week scan my little boy was even measuring a bit ahead, so I’m not concerned."
Wow Thanks so much
Hahaha I have been off meds lol
Clearly I’m not well.
Edited 😮‍💨

"Please be aware that RSD, or rejection sensitivity dysphoria, is not a syndrome or disorder recognised by any medical authority"
"

Rejection sensitivity dysphoria has not been the subject of any credible peer-reviewed scientific research, nor is it listed in the top two psychiatric diagnostic manuals, the DSM or the ICD"
"It has been propagated solely through blogs and the internet by William Dodson, who coined the term in the context of ADHD"
"Dodson's explanation of these experiences and claims about how to treat it all warrant healthy skepticism.

Here are some scientific articles on ADHD and rejection:

* [Rejection sensitivity and disruption of attention by social threat cues](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2771869/)
* [Justice and rejection sensitivity in children and adolescents with ADHD symptoms](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24878677/)
* [Rejection sensitivity and social outcomes of young adult men with ADHD](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17242422/)

Although r/ADHD's rules strictly disallow discussion of other 'popular science' (aka unproven hypotheses), we find that many, many people identify with the concept of RSD, and we have **not** removed this post"
"We do not want to minimise or downplay your feelings, and many people use RSD as a shorthand for this shared experience of struggling with emotions"

I took it for over 6 months before trying Stims
"I liked it, it was mild but I felt more balanced and stable in my emotions"
"

Really helped my binge eating.

Didn’t really boost my executive function a ton tho"
"And made me really nauseous if I took it without food.

I just asked my doctor about adding it back, because I’ve been suffering with binge eating."
My 13 year old started on it last spring
It took about a week and a half for him to start to notice a difference
Maybe a month or so for the impact to really be fully clear
He still takes 10mg of Ritalin in the am & 20mg at lunch on school days
"For our family, having the consistency of the everyday support that Strattera provides him has been helpful"
He deals with some anxiety and can tend towards having vocal tics
Strattera has eased that a little bit.
Started with 25 mg 3 weeks ago
I feel it coming up extremely slow
"My ADHD has gotten marginally better and I can focus a bit better on tasks, but I still have a ton of hyperactivity, inattention, etc"
Going on 40mg soon so hopefully my symptoms will get better
"It takes a while for it to build up in the system.

I had side effects like dry mouth so I drink a lot more water and pee more often"
"Nausea has never happened to me because I take it after I eat lunch.

I do in fact notice the improvement, just not as fast as I’d hope"
"If the medication does work, even after half a year, and it’s an alternative to using Adderall, Vyvanse, etc"
that we can’t even get our hands on then it’s worth it
"In fact, even typing this paragraph right now doesn’t feel too much for me"
Probably another sign that it’s working
"Me with Wellbutrin, did absolutely nothing for me I didn’t notice a difference"
"I think it's helping me some, but I'm still ramping up and it's a bit hard for me to say for sure yet"
"That said, as soon as the pharmacy finishes filling it I should be on 80mg. 


When I first started taking it, I *definitely* noticed it, but I also started at 40mg"
"It made me the most relaxed I ever remember being, the most energetic I've been since I was a kid, and gave me a raging case of insomnia the first two days"
"I also noticed noticed during those days that task switching/pausing was super easy for me, and that I was able to focus the best I think I've ever been able to.


Unfortunately, after that it has been a roll of the dice as to the effectiveness on any given day"
"I get massages around once a every month or two though, and the massage therapist noticed the differences in my muscle tension as well"
"While not as much as the first time, about a month after I started they noticed that I was more relaxed than I've been in the past, but not anything compared to the second day after I started the meds"
"This has meant my muscle tension has been a reasonable way for me to evaluate the effectiveness. 


I also have GAD and that first couple days really made me realize most of it is because of the ADHD"
"I'm hoping that on higher doses it will be more consistent, but I can't really speak to that yet"
"While I've been in 60mg for two weeks, I also have been sick the last three weeks or so making it really hard to compare"
Thankfully started feeling better today..
"Hoping it doesn't come back again like it seemed to after the second week. 


As far as I'm aware, Strattera drastically varies in how effects people"
"Some people get tired from it, some get energetic"
"I would say since the side effects are under control, try working with your doctor to ramp up the dosage"
The advantages of this medication are it's not a controlled substance so it's easier to get and it's 24/7
"I haven't tried any other ADHD medications yet myself, but I admit the shorter durations on them seem like a big downside"
"I'd really prefer being functional all day. 


Good luck!"
Ahhh
My teen started this two weeks ago
He didn’t like the Ritalin or Vyvanse because it made him too shaky so he’s just on the straterra
He says he notices it working
But morning are still awful to get him moving
Thanks for the inside of your child’s experiences
It’s helpful.

"wait so you got dignoised and your mom tells you, you didnt wtf lol"
 are you able to ask your dad for help?
I don't know how to help or what to say but you have my support And just know that once you get through this it will get better
Possibly consult the school counselor or someone like that? Maybe they can help
"Or if you have a good relationship with another ""adult"" ( just mean for a way to have someone your mom might listen to or someone who could be your ""guardian"" in means of getting an appointment with a Dr ) I would talk to them about it"
Ultimately if there is not a way to get medicine that could actually help the situation just be patient and loving with yourself
Try creative ways to make things better
I have been managing my own un diagnosed ADHD this whole lifetime and it's so frustrating at times but other times I think damn I am pretty cool
And so are you! Big hugs
Also moms like yours and mine can be very challenging to cope with
You are not alone.
"I feel like I might approach it like, hey, but I'd still like to go to a therapist, figure some stuff out."
"I’m assuming you’re a girl, based on the avatar, which is very relevant"
"I’m 27f diagnosed AuDHD, the one thing that validated my whole experience a lot was when before we started the whole evaluation the specialist told me that in women ADHD mostly manifests in hearing.

I then proceeded to ace every visual test, get above average on some of those, and completely fail at everything that had to do with hearing"
"The doc would tell me 3 numbers I had to repeat and I’d forget them immediately.

I was also a bright kid that was branded as lazy, because I struggled to listen in class, didnt do homework, but did great in tech subjects (I’m assuming because you look at formulas there)"
"

Before I got diagnosed I also had a hearing test done, because I struggled to hear things"
Turns out this is also an ADHD thing
"

Maybe have your mom look into how under-researched ADHD in girls is and how differently it presents itself"
"Also if you were diagnosed, you may have done the same tests and seen the same issue with the non-visual tests."
tell your school nurse or counselor or whatever
you don’t need parents permission to get therapy after 14 (at least in california?)
"does she know? NO! 
go see your lovely therapist"
I’m planning on bringing it up with my dad tomorrow
"He’s much more open to speaking with me about these sorts of things, and he tends to be a mediator between me and my mom, so I’m hoping he can help change her mind.

And yeah, my mom’s pretty deep in denial about my ADHD for some reason (until it actually benefits her) xP"
"I’ll definitely be experimenting with how I approach this whole thing, particularly the classwork"
Thank you so much for the advice and the kind words! <3
You can’t just be googling “adhd symptoms” you have to specifically google “symptoms of adhd in girls”
"Oh wow, I never knew this! I’ve always been much worse at auditory processing than visual"
"I always figured that it was due to the ADHD, but never would have assumed that it was such a woman-specific thing"
I’ll definitely be looking further into that
"Thank you so much for the advice, as well, I’ll definitely give it a try!"
I somehow never knew about that
"I’ll look into the age for my state, as I don’t live in Cali anymore"
Thank you! : )

"as an undiagnosed, unmedicated teenager, I give up. (Vent)"
"TLDR: I’ve drifted through life ”normal” enough to pass compulsory education, albeit being seen as lazy"
"I’ve been okay with that, even if that meant working 150% for a fucking B through the most traumatic years of my life"
"I’m in college and completely stuck now, and medication — the thing I was looking forward to by getting assessed this year — is now out of the picture."

like your head feels dizzy or actual pain?
Pain
I kind of feel like my mind is floating away or like im crossing my eyes
It's hard to explain
I'm aware that im spacing out so im not sure if that counts as an absent seizures
But when it happens my head hurts
"And in the moment it's hard to come back/focus on what I was doing, but I eventually come back"
I just assumed that It was bad adhd and I was having trouble focusing
But now I'm gonna get my brain scan
I don't know how to feel
I just want the spacing out headaches to stop
I figured it just meant I needed stronger meds.
can not relate so I'm going to assume this is not adhd thing lol I'm sure its related in some small way hopefully other redditers hop on
My friend had this
They were seizures! She only knew to get it checked out because she saw it happen to Mitch McConnell when he glitched in a debriefing with reporters
And the news said he had had a seizure.
I think this may or may not be an ADHD thing
"I used to experience similar, but not quite as you described"
"Zoning out is definitely a thing I do and I'm guessing more common with Primary Inattentive ADHD in general? 


I wouldn't have pain while zoned out, but would get a brief twinge of pain in the back of my brain that makes me think of a stiff light switch getting flipped. 


I've noticed that it happens less now that I'm on Strattera and that I don't get that pain anymore, so I'm guessing in my case at least it's related to my ADHD"
"The medication seems to have helped with the cases where there was no clear cause.


I haven't had a brain scan or anything though, so who knows"
"I also have terrible vision and work in front of a computer all day, so eyestrain might also be part of it in my case (extremely nearsighted and have astigmatisms). 


I did also notice that overstimulation can be a trigger for me, especially in environments that are loud with lots of conversations"
"Earplugs seem to help motivate that.


Curious to hear how the brain scan turns out!"

Looking for ways to use how I work to my benefit

I would try to get a professional diagnosis
"I struggled with that for 1 year until I decided to ask my therapist (a professional, licensed psychologist) about it and we did a test and it was definitely ADHD"
"We worked for a time with it, but he said I didn't need any meds, just excercises to keep my focus, and resources to help with work routines"
"Since then, I felt relieved, and I could focus on improving my life with all of the ADHD resources there are, that work for me.

Now I've recently fallen into anxiety again because of that same diagnosis, but I'm trying to get better.

But what I want to say is, if you have many doubts and it's eating you up, then seek professional help"
It usually works
Don't give up!
ADHD is a pretty common disorder
"if you your self can relate to someone with ADHD its more likely you have it then not, reading this its pretty clear you probably do have it I noticed a lot of people on here have the same speech pattern lol"
next doctors visit you go to talk to them about it you can talk to your doctor privately if you need to just ask them.
thank you i definitely will

I dont focus despite using meds

"You say you don't know how to act, but then list ways that I guess you think you need to act but just don't want to because you're above it"
Then you go on to list ways in which other people aren't good enough for you
You've made yourself so superior to everyone else that your dating pool is effectively 0
"Don't worry it's mutual, no one would want to date someone who thinks like that either.

If you really want to find love you're going to have to scrap all of that, figure out what compassion and empathy are, be able to see yourself as equal to others and treat them with the dignity and respect that they deserve (even in your thoughts), and probably figure out what love really means to you.

I'm sorry you're starting in such a bad place"
It's going to take a lot of work
I suggest reading novels and trying to understand the characters from their perspective
Get familiar with theory of mind as a philosophical concept
Try genuinely being nice to people from time to time until you can do it all the time.
Get out of your head
 Be curious about others
Be kind
Smell good.
Lay off the porn.
"I had the same problem being younger, now Im like 10 years older than you probably what I can say is, you need to start worrying less about shit and just go with the flow at certain environments.

Lets say you are at a party, people dont wanna talk about deep topics, people just wanna have fun, specially girls.."
you need to start making some adjustments when you go those places
"Its not time to talk abous nietzsche or dotoyevsky, its time to talk funny and ""un-interesting"" things to people"
"And if you are with a girl and she is vibing with you, you can get a little bit deeper with her, but keep it flirty and lightly not to be boring...

How to attract the opposite sex? Develop your own unique style of fashion, get your hands on some expensive perfum, hit the gym constantly, have a decent hair cut and be always groomed, and always smile"
"If you look you are having a lot of fun at a party, girls will feel less intimidated to talk to you, than if you look like you are not enjoying yourself at all being there.

Having high standards is fine, just know you will have less opportunity than others who dont have those, but go and talk to different types of girs regardless if you feel attracted to them or not, you wanna be seem as someone who doesnt give much of a fuck and is just there to have fun/vibe anyway...

good luck out there"
I wouldn’t say that I think I’m better than others and I never got that feedback anyway
I’m a very respectful person and always have been
People actually like me when I have the motivation to interact with them
"But you’re right about one thing: I want the benefits of being in a relationship but I don’t wanna pay the price for it, and there are definitely things you need to sacrifice"
"I may have the tendencies of being a little narcissistic, so the thought of giving up all this „me time“ in order to allow another person into my life was always a super painful thought to me"
Maybe I’m not mentally there yet
I hope that taking meds is a gamechanger
Cause I have massive interest and energy problems when it comes to being a social person
"I get it that I made a bad impression with my first explanation, but I think this behaviour is just a result of being desperate"
"It just feels like even if wanted to try to get to know and being genuinely interested in people, my brain won’t let me."
"True, this is a valid point for every person."
"First of all thank you! As I said in another comment, my main problem is just not having enough energy for all this stuff"
"On some days I struggle with basic routines, and you can notice that in my looks"
"I have zero energy to work out, I won’t even attempt it anymore at this point, it’s hard to always look crisp and clean"
I tend to wear the same things cause it’s easier for me
At least I managed to establish an own style to some extend 2 years ago
But all these things still add up
"In the end, I’m not even remotely close to being the person I wanna be."
"I would add pay attention to your shoes and your hands, which women tend to do"
"If you are wearing crappy shoes and you have long fingernails with dirt under them, women would tend to be turned off"
"These are superficial things, but we live in a superficial world."
">I get it that I made a bad impression with my first explanation

I read through your first comment again and I might have taken the part where you were saying that you have to ""lower yourself to primitive communication"" a little too literally because I didn't make the connection to it being related to alcohol"
"I apologise for the harshness.

Anyways, where I said: ""(You) list ways that I guess you think you need to act but just don't want to"""
"The reasoning behind it aside: I used the word ""think"" specifically because it's more than okay to be yourself (I guess I have to add ""as long as you aren't hurting anyone"")"
"I don't fit in either, probably for the same reasons as you, and I'm not particularly interested in talking with people who wouldn't want to simply because I don't"
I'm unapologetically myself
"People still talk to me, and I live in a particularly conservative area where a lot of people are pretty insecure.

If you aren't being yourself then you'll end up getting into a lot of trouble later on because you can't be in a relationship with someone and also hide who you are for that long, at least if it's expected that they end up loving you enough to care to really find out"
I tried to fit in for a large portion of my life
"I went to clubs, drank, had ""primitive level conversations"", and then I met someone while doing that and married them"
I was able to keep the mask on for a few years but it lasted about eight before we finally split up
"Trust me, this is not something I'd wish on anyone"
"It's the kind of pain that lets you know that no one should ever have to experience it.

If nothing else, this I am sure enough about to be able to quote Shakespeare to you: ""This above all: to thine own self be true!""

>I hope that taking meds is a gamechanger.

It usually is, I suggest making this a priority"
"It may even change you to the point where it would mean something else to ""be yourself"""
"I completely changed myself, not in just like a ""different"" kind of way, but ""the exact opposite"" kind of way"
"I used to be a huge ass hole (I internalised my parents' narcissism) and now I just want to help people if I can or at least be a ""net positive"" for society I guess.

>Cause I have massive interest and energy problems when it comes to being a social person.

I actually have a lot to say about this because, as you could probably have guessed: I've struggled with it a lot myself"
"You could say I'm ""interested"" in it"
"I will hold off for now because ADHD could really be undermining your efforts here and until you can reevaluate things from the perspective of having been treated for it, I'd only be giving you more room to beat yourself up when you shouldn't be.

>I think this behaviour is just a result of being desperate"
"It just feels like even if wanted to try to get to know and being genuinely interested in people, my brain won’t let me.

Yeah, that's 100% something I'd expect to hear from someone struggling with ADHD"
"It's literally almost word for word something I told the specialist that diagnosed me with it ~10 years ago.

I think I've probably gone on long enough here, the main take-away for you should be: please don't worry too much about this now, go see a doctor/specialist, let them do their thing, let whatever the outcome of that is to settle, then come back to this"
"You can even direct message me if you want, like I said: this topic is very interesting to me and I'd be more than happy to talk about it when you're ready.

Good luck to you."
Well not everyone
Not everyone watches porn
Especially not excessively
I think that will help you a lot with how you view women
Women can sense when men only see them as sex objects and nothing else
It feels creepy being around them
So try that and good luck!

"Please be aware that RSD, or rejection sensitivity dysphoria, is not a syndrome or disorder recognised by any medical authority"
"

Rejection sensitivity dysphoria has not been the subject of any credible peer-reviewed scientific research, nor is it listed in the top two psychiatric diagnostic manuals, the DSM or the ICD"
"It has been propagated solely through blogs and the internet by William Dodson, who coined the term in the context of ADHD"
"Dodson's explanation of these experiences and claims about how to treat it all warrant healthy skepticism.

Here are some scientific articles on ADHD and rejection:

* [Rejection sensitivity and disruption of attention by social threat cues](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2771869/)
* [Justice and rejection sensitivity in children and adolescents with ADHD symptoms](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24878677/)
* [Rejection sensitivity and social outcomes of young adult men with ADHD](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17242422/)

Although r/ADHD's rules strictly disallow discussion of other 'popular science' (aka unproven hypotheses), we find that many, many people identify with the concept of RSD, and we have **not** removed this post"

Talk to your doctor not people on Reddit
Most doctors have a care team you can call for free with these kinds of questions
"

Just think about this way"
Who are the ads paid by and what are they trying to sell you in place of your current medication?
"^^^ This,  never trust an ad that says if you do [this commons thing] it secretly causes [scary sounding problem], so buy our product instead!"
Claiming cortisol issues is the latest buzzword for these scam artists
"""Cortisol face"" is what I started getting targeted with and I just blocked them all"
Fuck these ads
"

I’ve seen similar and it’s disgusting that they’re going after the most effective  medically approved way of treating adhd"
"

These people are snake oil salesmen."
Cortisol seems to be the current marketing scam online - just in time for the holiday season which is stressful enough for most people.
Ignore any scientific claims in an ad for anything that the FDA doesn’t regulate
I’ve never seen one that’s accurate
I even saw one that claimed you could develop ADHD newly as an adult
"I wish Google required Adsense ads to have medically correct content, but it’s good business and no one is making them change, so it’s going to be this way for a while."
Ads are notorious for being false
"I remember seeing old snippets of smoking ads, mentioning its the best thing you can do for your health"
Not anymore it aint.
How do you block these ads on Reddit?
"Oh my ads on Reddit are mainly about Tech education, so I don't mind the ads I get on here, so I don't know sorry"

How has medication affected your ability to set and achieve long term goals?
"Your body is unique, as are your needs"
Just because someone experienced something from treatment or medication does not guarantee that you will as well

ADHD makes me good at “no time to think” situations
Adderrall makes me good at considering events in the medium term
My long term planning is quite amused by all of this futility
I feel like I work a lot and am overwhelmed with my job being one person doing all of the work
So most of the organizational clarity I get mostly goes to that and not making a mistake in my field throughout the days/weeks
"

Medication has helped tremendously, but I feel like much of what it gives me goes almost 90% towards my work, and I get paid decently well for it, but I have not been able to translate that to my personal life quite as much as I tend to take breaks from my meds over the weekends when I don’t work.

So short term is mostly affected by my diet, sleep, screen time, physical activity choices

Medium term is most greatly helped by my medication in giving me more clarity and focus for things that require some work/planning to be done a week/few weeks or a month in advance"
"Things that require consciousness in advance and then being present enough in the moment to act on when it comes.

Long term is a combination of the short term daily habits combined with how effective that is within the medium term results/planning over time"
Often times my short term day to day is what throws me off being very busy/exhausted with work
I tried Ritalin/MPH/Vyvanse and like Vyvanse the most
"I plan to take it long term, because it is the best at lifting my depression to a significant degree, with only minimal unwanted side-effects"
It does absolutely nothing for my longterm goal setting or daily procrastination though...

Are you medicated at all?
I def have anxiety coexisting alongside adhd
But no I’m not medicated for either currently
I have been on meds in the past

thank you 🖤🖤🖤🖤
"I'm dreading it because I have to go to work and face my coworkers and I probably won't be able to explain the bit that set me off because they won't give me the chance to and because the person that I'm still mad at because he goes on power trips all the time is related to my boss and his temper is worse than mine, so he'll just get angry and the boss will side with him and tell me to shut up and stop making things worse for myself"

well..
its better then living under dictatorship or the corruption of communism....
Ok
" What about capitalism do you find to be harmful to ADHD, specifically"
We live under the dictatorship of finance capital
"You’re just confused how it is optically presented to you and how everywhere else is presented to you by institutions.

Communism according to Marx is “the Real Movement of the People which seeks to sublate the premises now in existence.” Meaning we need to supersede the current relations to how our social relations to the productive forces are established and based within the means in how they already function.

Communist dictatorship is People’s Dictatorship instead of the current existing dictatorship of speculative bankers, aristocrats, corporations, etc."
"It is, but I doubt that it is because of capitalism, the restrictions we have in place, and America's constitution prevents some corruption and dictatorship"
"If capitalism didn't have these restrictions it would be the same as ""communism"""
"Well, when it was designed, it didn't have us in mind obviously"
"When our system was created, a lot of people weren't in mind"
Expectations put on us that all of us can't keep up with
We are forced to be productive or sacrifice our mental health for someone else's profit while not getting much of a gain out of it
I see a lot of people with ADHD saying they work harder to keep up with everyone else
We are forced to fit in which can cause alienation for a lot of people
I try to keep an open mind but I don't see how it can benefit us
"People bring up the same brainwashed argument about capitalism = freedom which it doesn't without restrictions from our government it can go bad really fast, it's better than communism even tho the ""communism"" that existed was never like what was proposed by Marx but more of a deception to power from the lack of restrictions, some arguments that communism = famine, dictatorship or any other argument but can't even define communism."
"The entire quote was: Communism is for us, not a state of affairs which is to be established, an ideal to which reality [will] have to adjust itself"
We call communism the real movement which abolishes the present state of things
The conditions of this movement result from the premises now in existence
"
 
This means to me that the movement is about moving on from how things currently are and what makes this movement happen exists in what the common goal is"
"Well, guess everyone is about to find out if that is true..."
Abolish from German to English is “sublate” or aufhebung
"Which is positive sublation, “negation of the negation”"
Yeah sooner or later
So you're saying he wants to abolish the beliefs we have now

"This is what they did for me, and I think it's because your symptoms + how you approach the test can really help them diagnose it."

They need to establish IQ score in order to determine the affect of the ADHD on her scholastic achievements.
You can have a high IQ and ADHD
"I was told those patients compensate better as they rely on their intelligence, until they can't any more"
Ah that makes sense and is helpful
Thanks
May ask if there were other tests as well?
"I don't really remember, I was 7 when I got the diagnosis"
I can try asking my parents
It can vary a lot from person to person and country to country though.
Actually I'm 50 year old male Canadian in Thailand
This hospital one the most respected or recommended
It might differ quite a bit then since I'm from Denmark! Glad to see people over 40 go get diagnosed

Actually she's much better than my previous doctor
The old doctor just wanted to diagnosis me fast and prescribe me meds
"

This doctor has been working 3 sessions helping me filter out my past trauma effects and my ADHD"
Something that I really needed but never knew that I needed it.
"It's possible to do both at the same time, though"
There's nothing that says you have to be struggling and unmedicated to address trauma you may have experienced
"

That's like telling a diabetic person that since they should also lose some weight (for example), they don't need insulin until they've done that.

Talk to your doctor about how, some you appreciate the effort to address other issues you may be facing, you've now found that your work performance and ability to focus while not on medication has deteriorated so much that it's putting your job at risk."

You did a great job describing your mind
Are you a writer? It could be what you do …
I think a little phone time before bed is ok as long as you have ability to shut it off
I listen to boring radio to help sleep
That’s way easier to transition to sleep than from a phone
![img](emote|t5_2qnwb|35055)
Ughhh i relate to this so hard
People’s advice is quite often unhelpful af because I’ve tried it all already or looked it up already
"And the sleep hygiene advice that is recommended by professionals is not helpful no matter how many times over the years that I’ve tried it again and again and again.

You’re explaining my sleep experience to the T"
I HAVE to tire my brain out to sleep bc I can only get to sleep of my brain is exhausted
Nothing else works.
"Yes I know it's because everything you see on the internet is unnuanced because you have to appeal to the majority, and us people with adhd and autism are not the majority"
I know they're professionals
Just wish I was told advice that actually works.
I could try listening to a podcast that's only mildly interesting
"For some reason, I am very good at describing my mind, but describing most other things.."
well it might just be more productive to make babbling noises
I usually watch phone until I suddenly get tired and go to sleep around 3 am.
"Do you also get ""systemic nightmares"" basically when you're almost asleep your brain trying to find systems in random stuff from the day and freaking out when they don't make sense"
Idk if this is the same thing but I get stuck in pattern loops
The pattern loops are usually prompted by me trying to find something dumb to quiet my mind - it doesn’t work but then I can’t really stop it
So it will be something like counting to a certain number over and over again
"(Sorry, I’m not sure that I’m explaining this well 😂)

Then I get jolt dreams that wake me up when I’m finally going to sleep"
They aren’t scary or anything just things that seem to be happeningbut I know they’re not happening - where I hear someone talking to me that isn’t there or see something that didn’t happen but they’re like quick lucid dreams that shake me awake because half of my brain is still awake and doing imagination things if that makes sense.

Congratulations on becoming an attorney
I guess you have too keep applying and networking to get a job aa an attorney
"

It's tough situation that you're in now but you still have nearly 30 years till your 65"
That's allot of time which you can use to build a life you enjoy.
I'm 34
"Knew school was a waste of time, I don't have what it takes to focus and study"
I make pizzas and hoagies for a living
I live with my mother but pay half the bills at an apartment I share with my cousin
I would live there but there's no garage there and all I care about are my motorcycles
"

I never thought I would go anywhere or be anything"
"The fact that I own a motorcycle, let alone 4, is more than I ever thought I would be able to manage"
"

Fuck ADHD."
"First off congrats on becoming an attorney! 

Second, I'm in a similar boat"
I work as a manager at a fast food chain and play music on the side
It's so hard with ADHD to find anything to keep my interest
You'll get in eventually you just have to network and look for a foot in the door
"I wonder how much your environment is a limiting factor here — bringing down your mental health, causing anxiety and interpersonal stress, etc"
"

Sometimes we ADHDers need to make a radical move and put ourselves outside our comfort zone to rise to the occasion"
"Something about urgency and novelty, even if stressful, can make us more functional"
"

Is there any way you can experiment with getting out of your parents’ home, even temporarily? What about trying a shorter term rental or sublet situation? Maybe someone you know needs a longer term house sitter"
"Ask your friends, your network, look online, etc"
"

Living with strangers isn’t always so bad, tbh"
Especially if you know it’s temporary
You might be pleasantly surprised
"

Getting some space from your parents might do wonders for your relationship and also your self esteem"
It could help break you out of some stuck patterns and feelings
Or not! Might be worth an experiment though.
CoL now is very expensive..
I too want to live alone or even have my own family...
I don't even have a career
"What I do isn't even really a job (reseller).

I'm currently going through hell right now, actually"
I live with my parents and recent unrelated events have triggered the anxiety aspect of my ADHD and now I'm just kind of tormented by it
"I'm going to go visit a therapist this Monday but it feels like forever.

I wish life wasn't so.."
Whatever it is
I'm not made for this world I feel
:(
I have a cat
I can't just leave him behind.
"Pet friendly housing options exist! You just have to find them.

Happy birthday btw!"

I use a smart light to mimic sunrise and set my phone alarm to go off just after the lights hit full brightness
Seems to work pretty well for me.
"Lots of people with ADHD have sleep issues, but yours do seem more extreme than most"
"

I think you should consider asking for a referral to a sleep specialist"
They can evaluate whether you have any additional sleep-related conditions.
I was where you were though
I have 5 alarms set on my phone because snooze is dangerous
"I usually get up on the first one now though, I made it a goal to not bother my wife with multiple alarms I think that helped"
"

I think part of it was age though I find the older I got the easier it is to stay awake"
Though I still on occasion sleep through one or two alarms
Amount of sleep affects it effects it
"Near nothing would wake me up in the first 3 hours 

I second the sleep study or at least a watch that monitors your sleep levels to get an idea of you're getting enough."
"Idk if this is specifically adhd related but anecdotally I have this same problem 😅

And I have also had it all of my life (and unmedicated)."
Unfortunately you could shine a flashlight right into my eyeballs and I will still want to sleep
😕
Thank you for your input
"That is exactly what I was wondering…I knew sleep and ADHD were linked but I didn’t know what was beyond typical ADHD sleep patterns.

I am starting a 2-week sleep diary to give to my Physician next time I see her, to try to explain more of what I am dealing with since it’s hard to put into words… i usually just get told to try exercise or melatonin, put electronics away etc… but it’s not the falling asleep thats hard, it’s the waking back up lol 😕"
I have 15 alarms set on my phone for the morning… I turn them off in my sleep
That’s what made me get the tabletop alarm so I’d have to walk over to it
But I just sleepwalk and turn that off too lol

You need to develop a human resources department in your company
"If you do not have one, you need to draft a series of HR policies which are clearly written, posted in the breakroom, and serve legitimate needs for your business"
"Make it clear if anyone violates the workplace policies, you'll issue formal warning with counseling, then begin issuing write-ups for future infractions"
"Most places do three write-up's before termination is issued.

As for your instructions, you need to make them clear, and outline them"
"If nobody can understand your instructions provided, you need to run them by someone else who holds similar title in the company as you, or you may need to find a partner to help run your business.

You also need to make it clear that if these performance standards aren't met, it will require a conference/meeting regarding subpar performance"
"If it isn't corrected, their are tools such as a PIP (which should be used sparingly) to correct employee's behaviors.

At the end of the day, an employee's feedback is critical and allows you to succeed"
"At the same time, nobody knows your business and it's vision more then you do"
Their are certain lines you need to draw and make clear with your associates if they want to continue working for you.
One thing that you might find useful is to start listening to Manager Tools podcasts
Start with the Manager Tools Basics casts
"

These will teach you good ways to connect with your employees, give them feedback in a way that can help early on, coach them in continuous improvement, and delegate effectively"
"

Also, I seriously recommend:

A) If you don't have an admin/assistant, hire one
B) Listen to the trio of casts about Effective Executive, Efficient Assistant"
"

Using an admin effectively can deal with some of the basic executive functioning issues we have"
"

Hm"
"Yeah, as a starting point that will help."
[removed]
"This is gonna be harsh but please consider it.

You're either hired extremely poorly, or you're an extremely bad manager"
"

This is your business"
"If you have people that knowingly slack off, manipulate you, and ignore your instructions you fire them"
"

There's also the chance that your employees are right and your directions are incoherent and sporadic"
You just seem like a crazy boss and they're just trying to get through the day
"

Try to get honest opinion on how things are running"
"Not sure if you have an advisor, someone you trust in the business to get feedback"
And it's important not to punish anyone for sharing opinions that you don't like
If you do this you'll destroy all trust for honest feedback.

You're doing the right thing to look into a diagnosis

You're struggling more now because your support systems don't exist at school - things like having your parents to keep you on track; routines; even the way your room is laid out"
If you've got a roommate that can be another major source of distraction

You'll need to build replacements, which is hard, but can be much easier with understanding and medication"

In the meantime, start with this: one thing done is better than zero things done."

"putting less stress on yourself to get things done in advance like people without ADHD and realize that you will realistically wait until the last minute and get it all done the day/night before.

Wish I had some better advice here but the best pearl of wisdom that I have is that my mental health improves when I don't try and work against the annoying (non-focused) parts of my brain and instead lean into the fact that I work tremendously well under pressure and will eventually get it done when the deadline hits.

Sometimes just letting a little of the pressure off actually makes me get more done in advance.."

omg following!! i'm sure there is a way to rig this up with alarms on the iphone too probably
On my Alexa devices I have routines to tell the time at key times like dinner.
"So I don’t like alarms because I don’t wanna have to go find my phone and turn it off like I just wanted to read it to me also like I have time blindness in the shower and I don’t wanna have to be you know, pressing my alarm every five minutes or at my reminder time, etc"
🤔
"you can set alarms to just vibrate, or you can also set recurring “events” in the calendar that will just be a notification saying what you’re doing today"
For example have an event called “dinner” and set a reminder for it on the calendar at whatever time you wake up
You can also set up text to soeech for notifications

Fidget toys are GREAT for keeping a hand occupied
I have a set from [Kaiko](http://kaikofidgets.com) that help keep me sane through the day
"I think they're having a big sale atm, too.

As a cigarette substitute, I think there are pen-like fidgets that would give a similar feel"
"Or there are coin ones that you can learn to juggle over your fingers :D Plus, that looks cool"
"

They've helped me reduce snacking while distracted, cause my hand is already occupied"
And they've been really good for letting me focus completely on tv/movies/games instead of ending up multi-tasking and missing things.
"While your fidget efforts might help, I'd lean on something like the Nicotine patch"
"I had to ""quit"" about ten times before it stuck, and nothing worked until I tried the patch"
The power that nicotine has over someone is crazy
He'll still think about smoking for a YEAR (at least) after his last smoke
"Oh, another protip: when he's ready, have him pick a date several weeks away so he can mentally get ready"
"He will likely fail a few times, and he might even be anxious about admitting that he failed"
Try to stay supportive
Good luck.
"in addition to the advice about smoking cessation others have commented, i’ve personally found having a “chew toy” works well"
You can find them on amazon but it’s basically a necklace with a rubber stick on it that you can chew on
It covers both the hands as well as the oral fixation that’s likely a part of smoking to keep occupied
"Also Lollypops and/or hard candy have helped my boyfriend quit baking in the past, since they give something to do with your hands and mouth"
And while candy isn’t necessarily healthy it’s definitely not as damaging as cigarettes
"also a bit more expensive, but they make flavored air “vapes” that’s just a tube that has resistance when you suck through it, and you can get flavor packets for"
"No chemicals or drugs in it, but the resistance  gives the same feeling as pulling a cigarette or a vape."

It definitely has been a struggle on and off
  I’m on vyvanse and IR Adderall/as needed
"  I was unable to get on vyvanse until I tried adderall, and my doctor told me most insurance companies won’t process claims for it until the patient has tried adderall"
  In regards to your question almost all ADHD meds are are on back order in LA - most pharmacies only get a select amount each month
 What has helped me sometimes is if I ask if they are able to fill different quantities
" If your doctor rights you a prescription for 10mg, can the pharmacy fill 20mg?  And then your doctor modifies the original script with less quantity"
 I’ve had to swap dosage before based on availability
  The other option (not ideal) is seeing if a different pharmacy that is “out of network” can fill it
" My insurance no longer has a contract with Walgreens, but I was able to fill my last script there and pay out of pocket, which i recognize can’t always be done"
"  However, with one of my scripts being generic and using GoodRx etc, I was able to fill it for $40"
 Good luck!
"I also forgot to say, but mail order typically has an easier time to fill"
 I was getting mine from optum rx for a bit.
Vyvanse or Dexedrine would likely be the closest alternatives you could get to adderall.
"Honestly, this is  a ""ask your doctor"" question"
"Just let them know that you're not able to fill your prescription, but are willing to try something else"
They're not going to be upset about you wanting to change prescriptions due to a lack of availability.
Don’t bother with calls
" They aren’t telling you the truth.

The only thing to do is go to the same pharmacy, ID in hand to pick up the meds"
 Be nice
 Get to know them
"When they are out, they will help you by calling around while you stand there, in person.

It’s not a thing that can be done online or over the phone because drug seekers have ruined it for the rest of us.."

Don’t give up
Progress is progress
Do your best and start looking for other arrangements
Maybe stay with a friend until you finish your class
You can do it
"Surround yourself with people who believe in you because if you don’t, you’re not setting yourself up for success"
I believe in you
Don’t listen to anyone that says otherwise.
thanks
honestly was just a shouting match
it'll blow over lol
"Once I pass the course and exam, start working, make money, pay them back whatever I owe"
It'll be completely fine
Not everyone is going to love me or see my side of the story
Just how it is
"I don't feel like getting mad for expecting my own parent's patience and support is unreasonable, but I suppose nobody really cares about mens needs anyway"
Not even my own folks.
Unfortunately that’s how it goes for people with ADHD
People think we’re faking or just incompetent rather than recognizing that our brain structure and function is legitimately different
We can’t just turn off the ADHD and say “ok brain… GO!” It doesn’t work like that
People don’t understand what they can’t see and it’s even worse to try to explain the struggles when there’s not necessarily something we can do to fix it
Like people with ADHD can be forgetful but even with a calendar and reminders it’s not always 100% fixable
We still forget even with all the help in the world
And people don’t get that
They chalk it up to laziness and incompetence when really people with ADHD are very intelligent
It’s not an intelligence issue
It’s an executive function problem that we can’t just turn off on a whim.
Thanks for replying
You hit the nail on the head
This is the absolute worst
Nobody fucking gets it
Astounding lack of empathy in this world
The only people who get us is us
Others that say they do really don’t
But I appreciate the effort.

Could I afford to be harder on myself? What do I do if I can't hold myself accountable?

I am feeling this way today too big time
Sending you a big hug  -you aren't alone
I know how you feel
This year in particular has been trying to kill me and it's taken a lot of strength and support to keep me from snapping
"We're more than the bad things that have happened to us, and there is a life worth living somewhere in this twisted world, we just have to find it"
"Took me a long time to make friends, find a soul mate, and a job that isn't destroying my body, too late to avoid chronic pain and disability, and the debt that came with it"
On top of facing felony drug charges for having my stimulants and pain medication out of their bottles
Even though I'm innocent I still had to take out a huge loan to pay lawyers to prove it
"I've had so many angry, violent thoughts of self destruction this year, but I'm still here, and I guess I'll live to fight another day."
I feel this in my soul! Want to quit my job after this week
I can’t do it anymore.
I’m gonna take a break from my meds next month bc the effectiveness wears out
"Totally feel you, I’m on dex and I think it makes things worse"
I feel like it takes all the strength in the world to do anything
Going to the pharmacy to get a prescription is like a mammoth task
I suffered a back injury earlier this year and have had severe pain since
Makes it really hard to do my job as I have to sit at a desk
I really want to quit and focus on recovery but can’t afford to
It’s extremely hard to find the will to go on some days
The only reason I have stopped taking my meds is because whenever I stopped previously I was so tired I could barely function and I can’t handle it
I don’t know what to do.
I can def relate
You're not alone
I wish I could help you
Sending all the good vibes your way.

NO.
"No, no, no"
I see this question on here way too often
NEVER tell a potential employer ANYTHING about your health
"

The only time I would ever do this is if the need arose to request formal accommodations, and in that case, I would only tell an HR person what they were legally required to know to provide them."
In my experience it's *always* better to keep your mental health to yourself at work
"It has never once benefited me in any way to let my employer know that I ""have issues."" All it has ever gotten me is more scrutiny and being treated like a problem waiting to happen"
"

Let them think whatever they want about you"
They don't need to know your most personal struggles to know if you can do the job; either you perform or you don't
Who cares if they think you're weird? I'd rather they think I'm weird but competent than think I need to be coddled or coached
"

Once you tell them, you can never take that information back, so make sure you're ready for them to know that about you"
It's not something I trust people with lightly
"Right or wrong, it will change their perception of you."
Director of HR here and abso-fucking-lutely not
"You wait until you need to ask for accommodations or if you feel comfortable sharing it.

Just remember they need to be considered ""reasonable"" accommodations for the business"
"If you have time blindness trying to ask for a ""lateness accommodation"" because you struggle being on time for meetings will not fly in most places"
"

Telling your employer you have ADHD doesn't do anything"
"It isn't up to the employer to come up with accommodations, it's you and your doctor"
And it doesn't give you some kind of pass by just disclosing it
"If you have tendency to be forgetful and your job requires remembering dates or attention to detail, if you can't do the job, you can very legally get terminated."
Dog I'm gonna give you a little piece of advice cause people are assholes
"Never, ever, talk about ADHD at work."
No
Never
Work is masking
Personal life is unmasking
Don't let them know anything.
Short answer is no
Long answer is nnNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Never tell them during the interview
"And only tell them after if you absolutely need accommodations, which should be done in writting with a note from a medical professional"
It does you no good to tell people things about your mental health that they may or may not understand properly unless you have to.
"Tips for asking for small accommodations without even letting your employer know you have adhd:

- for appointments, meetings, etc CALENDAR STUFF you can’t forget, if it’s not already a company procedure just be like “hey I can get really focused on my task - can I get a TON of incremental calendar reminders ahead of meetings?” 
- for not being pulled out of focus time, use that calendar to literally “block off” heads-down work time, that signals to your coworkers you’re getting stuff done please wait until 2 pm to call me or whatever (you can get creative with this - my work is chill and we’re all young so I set a status on Slack that just says “I’m not allowed to yap right now” lol)
- if you’re struggling with procrastination and deadlines, I’ve got a few"
"1) if the issue is it’s just too big a task and you never know what to chip away at next, call a work buddy and be like omg I need coffee - tell me what to tackle next! 2) if the issue is micromanagement or no schedule control, explain that you work better when you know what your deadline is and what the expectations are, and you can manage your own tasks within that timeframe"
"3) if you need a little “external pressure” for boring tasks, ask your supervisor if you can set little “check-in” meetings at regular intervals because they help you stay on track"
"(If you need to sell that one to your supervisor you can also say “it would be nice for you and your schedule too if I saved up all my questions for our check-in rather than calling/messaging you as they come up!” 
- be really strict about breaking for lunch and EAT LUNCH even if you are on meds that kill your appetite!! 
- get a daily or weekly (depends on your needs) UNDATED scheduler/agenda and use it to make not e of EVERYTHING you can’t forget"

Most symptoms can be played off as “lol I have this quirky trait, but I know exactly how to work with it!”Ex: “jeez, I’ve got a sieve for a brain - can you remind me what John said about x this morning??” 

Also!!! Probably your 100% at work is your average joe’s 60% so don’t get too in your head - when it comes to work it’s more important to strive for consistency than maximum production, I’ve found!! My 3-4 hours of good hyper focus is equivalent to my coworkers full day so…"

"NEVER --- half the staff has ADHD, but you won't score any points for vomiting"
Keep it under your hat ~
I knew a guy who disclosed his ADHD while working at a disability advocacy organization
Suffice to say he no longer works there
There is almost never a circumstance where ADHD disclosure will end well
Sadly disability rights and accommodations don’t really exist despite what the law says.
Absolutely not and it’s best to keep it to yourself for the duration of your employment there.
fuck no
"I'm AuDHD and, yeah, no"
I will never tell any employer that
"They WILL discriminate against you and potentially even fire you, even if it is against the law."
"I’ve never mentioned it since diagnosis, but gradually over time the subject has come up & I’m happy to share it & support others"
I have several colleagues who have ADHD &/or are n the autism spectrum & as the older colleague I like to look out for them
"
It takes one to know one, as they say"
"
It makes no difference to my job or my work record"
We’re a very diverse bunch & it’s fantastic.
Absolutely not
It is the best way to ensure you don't get the job
Reading the comments because I need a new job
I just want to cry myself to sleep now.
You bet your ass I don't mention that sensitive information.
No
"And while we’re at it, also don’t write “nUEroSpiCy” on dating profiles"
I cringe every time I see it
"If you’re properly managing ADHD, it shouldn’t be something that drives your entire personality 24/7."
"Usually no, but it depends"
"

Recently got a job where multiple people on the team admitted they have it during the interview process"
" I used it at that point to spin it as a positive during the panel interview, saw a lot of nods and got an offer 10 minutes after the last interview."
"NEVER EVER MENTION THAT!

Do not tell your employer or your coworkers anything about your health, unless they are legally required to know."
"Wait until you have the job, then bring it up"
"If you tell them that you have it during the interview, they might not hire you."
Absolutely NOT
Are other people in interviews telling about their ulcers that make them bedridden once in a while or their migraine headaches or their tinnitus or their cancer or their bad back? Nothing good can come of telling them this
"After you get hired you can tell them you work best in a certain way (no distractions, walking around not sitting all day, etc)."
Hellllllll
No
To
The
No
No
No
"

I’m an HR Manager"
Never disclose during an interview
"Wait until hired and then go through the reasonable accommodation process, if an accommodation is needed."
I wouldn’t mention it during an interview
"I don’t know what type of job you’re applying for, but in my case, it actually helped me to tell them AFTER the interviewing process"
"I work in food service and am really good at certain jobs like making the food and cleaning and washing dishes but absolutely despise being on the register because I often forget things, have trouble speaking, and most of the time cannot hear what the customer is saying due to auditory processing issues"
"So in that case, I let my managers know that having ADHD prevented me from doing that certain job as well as other people were able to, and I haven’t been expected to do it since"
"Of course, this is vastly different from an office job, and I can’t say whether telling your employer is a good idea or not in that regard."
short answer: NO
disability discrimination in the workplace is very real
mentioning a disability that you have during an interview would only harm your chances of getting the job
"if you're located in the US and you really feel like it's necessary to tell them, wait until you're hired and ask HR for accommodations for your disability."
"Saying you have ADHD sounds like giving an excuse to perform bad at your job, even before you get the job"
"So no, never!

A company has the obligation to hire competent people, if you have ADHD, it's your responsibility to manage it and perform well in your job, not the company's."
I'm going against the grain here
"Sometimes, though very rarely, it's fine and maybe even beneficial to share during the interview process"
"Again, RARE"
"It depends on the position, the company, the people, the tasks and responsibilities."
"I disclosed my diagnosis during the interview for my current ""job"" (I'm technically a freelancer, not an employee) and it sealed the deal in hiring me and it's been an incredible fit."
not now and never
learned the hardway
"just no..
stay silent if somebody asks."
I didn't tell them during the interview
I got the job but as a temp to permanent status
"Once I was permanent, I still didn't tell anyone but didn't lie on the paperwork they gave me"
Don't tell them beforehand as it might affect you getting employment even if they are equal opportunity employment or some shit
I got lucky as my job is high stress fast pase most times and I can get by.
"The very luxurious position...

I'd say yes, because I see it much like I see my trade union activism: I don't want to work for someone where my ADHD (or TU work) is going to be a problem for them"
"It's one of the litmus tests for whether I would like working there.

At this stage, I also simply can't be bothered to hide it.

As I say, though, I'm conscious that's the luxurious/privileged position, and only really works if you're not desperate for the/a job."
"I would avoid mentioning it during the interview, at least directly, but if you have to, I like to describe it for myself as how my brain thrives on a very well-defined task, and really hates disorder, as disorder makes my attention span go to zero.

Although instead of mentioning it in a negative sense, like what your brain doesn't like, I would recommend reversing that and saying, using my example again, that my brain performs optimally when there's lots of structure in what I'm doing"
I think it depends on the job
"I am a school psychologist so I mentioned it during my interview because I discussed how it related to my time in school when I was not identified, what that was like and how I can use it to be able to better relate to students and their families.it also helped explain my reasoning for wanting to be a school psychologist and wanting to identify those kids who fall through the cracks and get them help before it’s too late"
I say don't disclose it upfront
Get a feel for the vibe first
Or bring it up if and when it becomes relevant
"""Why didn't you disclose this earlier?"" They ask- because my medical information is none of your business and I am under no obligation to disclose it unless it stops (key word- stops) me being able to perform the duties on my PD.

I ended up disclosing my ADHD to my job and in a lot of ways it bit me on the arse- but in the end it saved me from being fired by an aggressive upper management prick who didn't want a discrimination charge against him.

My direct manager was originally a bit baffled by it but now if she really needs something done fast and accurate, as a hail mary, she'll slide up to me and clandestinely say ""wanna break out the hyperfocus goblin?"" 

She knows that shit will get done but that I'll be lost to the mortal realm for the foreseeable future"
"

She's even been a great support while I adjust to my meds; checking in on me, pointing out areas of improvement and accommodating me when the side effects kick my arse.

So results are mixed and complicated but I don't think that there's a blanket right or wrong to disclosing your ADHD status."
I did at my last couple of interviews and was offered a position at both (still happily working at the one I chose)
"In my case it happened to be a plus, but these were very small companies that were desperate for qualified help and I think AuDHD isn't unexpected for accountants anyway."
Do not offer that information ever
"They do not need to know ANYTHING personal about you, and them asking would be illegal"
"If you ever need “reasonable accommodations” under the ADA, then you would speak to HR about that after you’re hired."
"I told them, but then I’m a Service Manager in mental health, so I’d expect them to be good with it"
"They are, our head of HR also has ADHD."
NOOOOOPE
"If you need accommodations at work, put in a formal request with HR *after* you get hired"
Never mention it during a job interview
"

They aren’t supposed to discriminate against people with disabilities but “they didn’t hire me because I have a ADHD” is very hard to prove unless they outright say that’s the reason in writing.

If you do disclose that information, be prepared to have it used against you"
My manager would scapegoat me whenever she forgot to do something after I told her about my diagnosis.
"Yeah, in terms of any sort of invisible disability, I would refrain from disclosing this information whatsoever unless you would obtain some sort of concrete advantage from doing so (e.g"
"certain positions/jobs being reserved for people with disabilities in the government, etc.)"
"And honestly, even if you were to get the job, I would not even share this with an employer unless it dramatically affects your work performance as a last resort measure."
"As someone that is fully open with both my boss and my minions about having ADHD, I would probably not mention it in the job interview unless it specifically came up"
"Like maybe if the interviewer shares about their own ADHD first, maybe? Idk"
I've been sitting on the other side of the table in interviews for a few years now and I'm not really sure what circumstances I would mention it as the interviewee.
No please don’t.
100% no
"I am very open about my ADHD at work, but I would never disclose the condition if I was going for an interview"
"Even if they dont care, if just another thing for them to decide against"
"

It's generally good practice in the job interview to stick to the skills they are looking for and say nothing about any downsides of your behaviors"
"I mean, no one would disclose in an interview that they're not a morning person"
"

If they ask ask about personal weaknesses, stick with the classics, I always feel I can learn more, rather than enough to solve the problem/do the job, but once somethings done I'm ready for the challenge"
"I have to really watch myself from saying yes to everything, I just like to help my colleagues when they need it, but I'm getting better at fighting my better nature and protecting my time...blah blah"
Stuff like that.
NO.
You know that phrase “everyone’s a little ADHD sometimes” that we all hate? Here’s where you use that thinking to your advantage
"

The stuff you described sounds like stuff any person could deal with"
Just focus on the individual circumstances (e.g
"“I doodle when I listen, it helps me concentrate” or “can you email me so I don’t forget about?”) Yes, having ADHD may be why you have your particular cocktail of quirks, but the only people I’ve seen connect those dots are other folks with ADHD 😆"
The problem with announcing “I have ADHD” is you’re letting people stereotype you and often not positively
"You probably don’t have every problem that is common with ADHD either, but they might start assuming you do, or they can overreact to your struggles, etc"
"

Note that If you need a workplace accommodation that requires disclosing it, that’s a different thing and you should probably  do it"
"But I think in casual conversation it’s better to focus on the specific interactions than the diagnosis, if that makes sense."
NO x 1000
Absolutely not
"Most of the time, they do not need to know that."
No
They have no right to that information and you have no obligation to give it to them
"Generally you should never disclose a disability before you’re hired, and it’s illegal (in the US at least) for them to require that info."
Almost never
There are one or two exceptions I can think of
I’m all for embracing every part of who you are
But ADHD’s definitely got some stigma with the general public
One exception I can see is if you work in a social services agency of some sort
The place I work is a mental health agency
These places will generally have a more liberal view of it
Often times a lot of people who work in mental health or social services in general do it because they’ve struggled quite a bit in their own past and want to help others overcome these things too
So it’s not uncommon for a lot of people working in mental health to have ADHD
The other situation I can think of would be MAYBE bringing it up if asked the question about describing a time you struggled and how you worked to overcome it
But even then you’d want to be very brief about the ADHD struggle part and largely focus on the “how you overcame it” part
"Like, “I have ADHD"
In the past that’s meant I’ve struggled with xyz
"So in order to really help myself, I did a, I also did b, and I now do c too"
I’ve found that it’s really helped and I don’t struggle with xyz anymore because of it.”
No
"
Unless you’re applying for a position with lived experience, But that Is typically peer support work."
"You will be giving them a big red flag, and they will pretend it was a different red flag than that when they let you know they're not interested."
Why would you? Not being snarky/ just wondering.
No
Any short term gains will also bring long term consequences
"Anybody with hiring power or is responsible for hiring input that knows about your accommodations could be biased enough to select someone else for a lateral move or promotion that you want.

Biases shape decisions and limit your opportunities"
"You will seen as a difficult or lazy person even if you don’t seem like you are, or someone will assume you will become problematic."
Hell no
Only mention it after you get the job .
No and your medical history is none of your employer’s business
"""Hey,  just so you know, I won't be as good as other employees if you decide to hire me""  🙄"
"No, I see it as a personality trait"
I’m funny as fuck and I don’t mention that either… they’ll figure it out 🙃
No
Never
"If you have to, bring it up after you've started, with HR, to get protected accommodations."
Nope
An interviewer is like any other normal person with their set of preconceptions based on life experience
"They may be trained to be unbiased but at best this information will be unhelpful, at worst it’s going to count against you."
No
Never.
"I wouldn't, you will still be expected to deliver the same results as non ADHD employees so there's really no reason to let them know up front."
I wouldn’t mention it til you have a problem
I wouldn’t give them any reason to consider another person over you.
Nope
Never discuss disabilities or medical conditions during an interview phase
"While discriminating against you for it is illegal, that doesn’t stop that"
They’ll document another reason
"And yes, they may find out any way but you have a lot more legal protections."
Nope
"I briefly spoke with my manager, but only after having established a good enough working relationship with her to know she also has it"
Note that this was only via call (nothing written)
It doesn't really give you any benefit so I wouldn't normally discuss it
"

You can admit one or two ADHD weaknesses WITHOUT calling it ADHD"
Nice coworkers are more likely to be gracious about making mistakes if you've already jokingly mentioned something
"

For example, joke that your greatest weakness is sending emails without the attachment"
Or that you have a dozen alarms for meetings
"Just small things, and only one or two."
"I personally would to provide a reason for the fact I have the memory of a quail, and so will not be able to answer the competency based questions amazingly well"
No legal requirement to disclose it
Get hired and pass probation first.
No
No
Never
No
Treat that info like you would your religious or political affiliations in a job interview.
Absolutely not.
"The short answer is no.

The correct answer is “would that help you land the job vs a second equally qualified person?” That test works for any and all optional disclosures in the interview process"
"Unrelated things like hobbies can help you relate to others, so bringing up a hobby can help you land a job.

There are probably a few cases where it may be helpful"
"Say you wanted to coach people with adhd about managing life to their satisfaction, the personal experience is a plus"
"

In most cases, it brings into question a lot without adding any value to your resume"
"Meeting deadlines, following meetings, showing up on time, impulsivity, etc"
all come into question
"You can still be so qualified for the job you still get hired, but the disclosure hurt your case"
You’ve got to give yourself the best odds you can.
"Why would you admit in an interview that you will probably/likely perform some task at a sub-standard level?

If your ADHD is controlled then they shouldn’t ever realize you have an issue"
"

If your ADHD isn’t controlled then they won’t be thinking ADHD when you don’t perform well"
They will assume that you just aren’t performing
"

Unless you have a way to claim some kind of accommodation regarding the ADHD and they have to accommodate you (or you are really sure they are the type of employer that will make accommodations out of the goodness of their heart) there’s really no upside to telling them."
The jobs I go for traditionally drug test
I'm medicated
Pretty much have to tell them.
Well it depends on the way you frame it
"I actually did mention that I had ADHD in my behavioral interviews, but I used it as part of an anecdote highlighting how empowering it can be to overcome your challenges"
But if you're bringing it up to foreshadow future weaknesses..
don't
"

  
Everything you say in an interview should highlight the positive solutions you bring to a team, not the potential problems you could create."
These comments saying no are scaring me now because I keep getting advised to disclose it to my employer 😵‍💫
"Never, never, never."
"NO!

In my opinion you should be able to do the same job as the rest"
"And if I were an employee I would expect that too, and someone mentioning their diagnosis would be a huge red flag, and it would make me wonder if you said it because you are going to use it as an excuse or expect me to give you some slack"
Or if you're stupid
"And then why would I hire you? I don't think it's about people being assholes as someone else mentioned, I think it's about people hiring the ones who seems to do their job, and your diagnose is none of my business."
"Never ever, ever"
"Not once, unless it’s related to the job, such as being an advocate"
"

That’s it"
No other exceptions
There’s another candidate in line who doesn’t have ADHD eager for that job
And millions of desperate people offshore who the employer is ready to exploit for half your wage
"

Don’t mention it"
Your job only cares that you are the best available choice for creating marginal revenue.
never
and don’t tell your coworkers either even if they become close to you within the workplace
it’s a trap
Employers are not your woke friends
They won't think you're cool for broadcasting disabilities
They won't hug you and take care of you like a mommy
It's actually so wild that people ask this all the time.
Ffffffffuckkkkk no
Never
Nope
"Not during the interview, and only if after getting the job you don't think you can do it without accommodation"
"Personally, I'd ask even if I thought the accommodation would only moderately reduce anxiety"
Stress kills
"For me, so far, telling my employer and asking for accommodation has been a net positive."
No
Don’t do it
No no no
I am from Canada
I wouldn’t disclose it during an interview and gauge your workplace culture before disclosing it to anyone at work to be safe
I started a new job this year and didn’t get formally diagnosed until months after starting
I have told my managers now that I have ADHD because my company prides itself on being inclusive and I want protection for myself should there be any issues in the future
The company I left wasn’t very inclusive or supportive of mental health so I knew I wouldn’t have been protected there with that kind of culture.
Absolutely not.
"No

Never

Why would you?"
Absolutely no
"Chose job wisely tho, as little administrative paperwork as possible"
"Hell no, interviews are a time to sell yourself and bentonite your adhd will give them a reason to deny you because of the stigma surrounding it true or not."
"Its probably not required, and depending on the experience of the people, it may lead to being overlooked for potentially better applicants"
"

I mean if the stigma is that you can't work, show up late, work slow, refuse to learn,  and offer nothing but excuses or just ""lol adhd"", would you want that?  


Obviously that's not going to be everyone,  but there definitely are some people out there like that."
depends if it’s relevant through the conversation
Sometimes I’ll bring it up as an example of some challenge or hurdles I had to overcome
"They’re gonna find out real quick I have it when I start fucking up, so I just tell them right away."
Definitely not.
No
 Not necessary
 Don't overshare lol
"No! Every time you screw up, it’ll reinforce your reputation as a fuck-up, whereas anyone else who occasionally slips up gets the “oh well, it happens to the best of us” reaction."
No dont do this
"Generally, you don't  **unless it is relevant to the workplace.** 
For example, if you're applying for a job working with ADHD children or an ADHD advocacy organization, you can phrase it like ""I personally resonate with the responsibilities of this position / mission statement of the organization.""  They'll likely know what you mean"
"And if they ask you to elaborate, phrase it like a strength, they'll you'll be able to use your lived experience as a connection.

That should be the **ONLY** circumstance when the Job relates to ADHD, where you disclose it in an interview, and only in a way that suggests strength"
"Otherwise, saying you have ADHD when it's not relavent will be perceived as a weakness, sadly"
"

I gave this tip to an Autustic/ADHD friend of mine when they applied to be an education aide for special needs middleschoolers this year, and they got the job!"
No
HELL NO
Lol
What? No.
No
 Fucking NO.
F NO!!!!  That will blow your whole interview to pieces!  Wait until you're hired on for at least a few months of you decide to disclose
"Then it will be discrimination based on a disability if they don't work with you.

Edit to add:  I work at Amazon and have told them about my bipolar and ADHD"
 They've been so accommodating
 I've even moved up.
No
"Hands down, no"
"If a specific symptom makes you great at a certain job task, highlight the symptom as a “quirk” or something"
I.e
"you’re going into a leadership role that requires a lot of vision casting, and you’re one of those people with a 5-acre hobby graveyard who can see the finished project in their mind but never finishes it"
"“All my life I have had an uncanny ability to create an intricately detailed vision of any idea, no matter how unfamiliar the idea is"
I find it more effective to focus on one project at a time and put all of my effort into that project (hyperfocus) rather than attempting to juggle too many ideas at once
"I thrive with a strong team who can help bring vision to reality, especially through collaborative sessions (where your team can point out practical oversights).”

Remember a person without ADHD often thinks that someone with ADHD just “needs more discipline” or something similar"
It leads to them micromanaging you and that’s likely to decrease your productivity
"Even if they hire you, they are more likely to “keep an eye” on you vs any other new hire."
Mental disabilities typically aren’t a good idea to mention unless asked specifically about them
"If they can’t tell, they don’t need to know"
"




ADHD in particular is one that I wouldn’t mention"
"For one, lots of people don’t even believe in it"
"Two, it’s a very heavily misunderstood disorder"
"And three, there is a common idea that people with ADHD are drug addicts"
Any of these can make you lose a job regardless of if it’s discrimination or not
"






Also because a lot of us diagnosed ADHDers are prescribed amphetamines or other stimulants it can create drug seeking behaviour potentially in your work place if word gets out which you just don’t want"
"Regardless of if you are medicated or not, that’s just not something you want to deal with.







That said, I would really just avoid mentioning any flaws in an interview that pose long term consequences to your productivity"
"When I’m asked about flaws I typically mention something that I can immediately follow up with: “but I’ve been working on it for a few weeks with (insert aid in fixing problem) and I’m getting much better at it.”






They may notice you are slower than others at things but come on, that’s not the conclusion people draw"
"Maybe they think you are tired or something.




I know that during my job over the summer my ADHD kicked my ass and no one batted an eye"
"Forgetting keys in door, forgetting my FOB in a locked room twice in 25 minutes only for the PSWs as the building to save me both times with a key they weren’t supposed to have lol"
"Being late for 3 weeks straight until the bosses pet lady threatened to rat me out, being absolutely dead tired on days people were talking to me but having tons of energy on other days, anxiety attacks, forgetting instructions mere moments after receiving them, being incredibly hesitant about even small tasks, and even one time when I was listening to my coworker talk to a tenant at the building I was at while also daydreaming as I do the lady said “you look really bored” and my coworker gave me a job to do"
"Nah I’m not bored, I just like to multi task lol"
"Anyways yeah, people don’t draw that conclusion"
"In fact if you look around at your coworkers you will find flaws in them to, but I highly doubt you would pick a mental disorder to class them under because that’s just not how people really think."
Nope
"If asked about inconsistency- your response should be - I’m human, it’s to be expected"
Sometimes my genius is sudden and exciting and other times I can’t seem to come up with anything
" 

If asked about being lost - I’m human, we have days where we can find all the puzzle pieces and fit them together and other days where we are struggling to locate one of them."
A job is not a human being
You don't need to be honest about that stuff like you're going on a date
The real world doesn't work like that
They honestly would probably rescind the job offer and make up a reason so you couldn't sue.
"Never or afterward either.Would you tell them you have a heart condition? It's not the same, but the same."
Wow wish I was reading this a year ago.
No.
"I do, but I spin it to a positive; with my medication I remain very focused on tasks, and it really tickles my adhd when I have lists of tasks I can cross off every day, it also never let's me rest while I'm ""active"" so I tend to keep going throughout the day, if anything I struggle to take breaks"
"And the best part is, I absolutely *love* routines, doing the same menial tasks every day is way easier to me than unexpected changes or any sort of variety, so put me somewhere, give me a list of things to do, never change anything unless it's permanent, and I'll be the happiest employee you have.

Employers love that, and I've gotten every job I've ever applied for and had an interview.

Edit: I should add that I'm from Norway, so it may not be as accepted or protected against discrimination where you are."
No! Fake it till you make it.
No nonononono
nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
No
Generally you should never tell them
There are very few reasonable accommodations that they could provide without just excusing you from parts of the job
"

A work lunch conversation turned to coffee, and I mentioned I don't drink caffeine which was a mistake because a clueless coworker asked me in front of my entire team if that was because I take Adderall"
"I don't take Adderall, but I am on ADHD medication which is mostly the reason for not drinking caffeine"
I was so shocked by the question that I basically didn't answer and just said nothing
So they probably all think I'm on Adderall now which doesn't bother me on its own but it's impossible to know what prejudices people have against people with ADHD and what they think about me now
Many people are not educated
"Most adults know you can't/shouldn't ask people shit like this at work but it could happen.

If you know of things that help you then just ask them to do those things without saying you have ADHD"
Just say it will help you be more productive
It will make you seem self aware as long as you are respectful and can still cope with the job if they decline your request.
No!
Absolutely not
"It will never make you more likely to get a job, but it might stop an employer from hiring you based on discrimination against stereotypes"
Even if you are perfectly capable of doing the job as well as or better than a person without adhd.
NO
NEVER
EVER
EVER
NO ABSOLUTELY NOT
NO
unless the job requirements say “must be ADHD” never do that
Ever.
Oh hell no.
"Could you yes, should you depends on if you are comfortable  doing so"
In the UK you can mark for reasonable adjustments in the application and if you are qualified you will get an interview and it theoretically shouldn't affect if you get the job or not
However they also legally can't require that you give them details.
I highly suggest you don't bring it up
"Simply put, in a professional setting you need to be responsible for and mindful of your own needs and limitations"
"If you forget to do something important because of your ADHD, the consequences will still be the same as for any other person"
"Therefore, it is important to find a job that works for you and your specific needs/limitations"
There's no shame in that
"Would you expect a deaf person to excel at sound design? Then don't expect someone with ADHD to thrive in a time-sensitive, high-speed environment."
"I feel like a lot of ppl don’t rly understand/know what ADHD can be like, and unfortunately it is still (at least where I’m from/live) connected to being lazy, dumb or unorganised"
"So no, I’d never say it during an interview"
"

I might say it once I’m comfortable enough at the workspace, my probation time is over and the subject comes up naturally"
"Otherwise, absolutely not"
Fuck to the no
"Absolutely not.

In a perfect world, employers would be understanding and empathetic of something beyond our control.
But it will only add as a detriment in the interview stages.

Put it this way, if an employer is presented with two equally skilled candidates and one has disclosed ADHD, the preferred candidate will 9/10 be the one without the 'mental health issue'

I say this as a person with ADHD who has told multiple employers about my condition, after I have been hired & & have job security, even then only when I believe it is safe / in my best interest to do so.

Unfortunately prejudice is strong, especially when people have a limited understanding of the intricacies of ADHD"
Which is unfortunatly the majority.
No
Fuck no
No way
I'd say it depends
"They technically don't have any right to know (at least where I live), but transparency about stuff like this can be an advantage in some situations and a barrier in others"
"It completely depends on the type of position you are applying for, the work environment and past experience of the interviewers and workplace with other diagnoses"
"

So I'd judge how many of your strengths are tied into your ADHD and how many drawbacks it has for you"
"An example from my own experience, is that my AuDHD traits allows me process things differently and sometimes pick up nuances or reach conclusions faster than my peers or that my peers just wouldn't have seen"
"But it also means that my social battery is a big contributor to whenever I burn out, so while I can participate, help organise and facilitate, and enjoy big social and professional events and gatherings, they're super expensive for me and usually takes me a while to recharge from"
"As in, a one-day event, like a project workshop, will take me at least 5-10 workdays of low-intensity work, before I can start getting back in gear for another big event"
"I can compensate for a little while during peak busy times, but I cannot run that forever without needing serious downtime or causing harm to my mental health"
"I was still in the process of getting my diagnosis, when I was hired, so I didn't mention it at the interview, but made sure to tell them what I would need to be an effective employee, which was largely supports to deal with my ADHD.

Similarly, my mum was bullied out of a previous workplace and went down with a severe stress reaction and burnout"
"When she got better and applied for a new job, she didn't tell them in advance that she had had these experiences or that she was still technically on sick leave from the job (union rep helped her get a generous severance"
"They'd continue to pay her her monthly salary, for the duration of her illness and up to a year)"
"It didn't take a lot for them to realise she'd been through a lot when she got the job though, because they had a work environment where they gave a lot of praise, which my mum was not used to getting"
"When my mum finally told them about her past experience, they didn't judge her and told her that they were happy she didn't tell them in the interview, because they weren't sure they would have taken the chance and given her the job if she had, but they were so happy to have her by then"
"

So I'd leave it to a judgement call, but whether you tell them about the diagnosis or not, you should still and always, advocate for yourself and you needs"
"Asking for certain accomodations to help you be efficient, are not inherently a barrier."
If you can spin it as a pro sure
"

If you’re trying to get a “cog in the wheel” job then fuck no."
I have not done so until now
"I will however, make sure I'll mention it when interviewing for my next job.

There are a lot of people I know that have been open and honest about their AD(H)D at work, which has worked very well for them"
"If they decide to hire me, knowing full well I may sometimes struggle with ADHD, that's a place I'd wanna work"
"
Moreover, teams consisting of both ADHD and non-ADHD employees tend to perform better on creativity and lead to an increase in organizational performance, so there's a silver lining for employers too."
No
"Never mention it, ever, for any reason

I made this mistake at one job and I felt like from then on, I was treated like a mentally challenged child"
"Keep in mind, I worked as an L6 engineer at Amazon at the time, which is considered like top 1% of engineers

People are not understanding"
People are not kind
"They don’t want to “deal” with someone, and would sooner replace you than try to understand you"
"Hell nah, i sure as hell don't mention im borderline as well."
They'll work it out soon enough.
I have been on a lot of hiring committees
"Do NOT bring it up, they will put your resume in the trash."
Just focus on what you’ve learned from adhd
The word itself gives bias
"No, that is medical and your employer doesn't need to know."
I don't think I would at the interview
"That's where you want to sell yourself, you don't want to tell then anything that will give them an excuse to look over you without even giving you a chance to show what you're capable of"
" After your hired, if ADHD presents any struggles for you, then you might consider it"
Especially if you need accomodations
 I had to disclose to my boss about my ADHD about 2 years after I started working there
"I was able to mask it for 2 years successfully, but some major life changes, and moving to work from home, made things stick out that I was able to mask better before"
" It worked in my favor to disclose only because it gave my boss a tangible reason why my performance suddenly tanked in administrative tasks, and saw my efforts to address the issue by going on meds and doing some changes to my routines, so he didn't have to fire me"
I was still promoted because he really likes my troubleshooting and scripting skills even though I suck at the administrative tasks and being one-time to all meetings
" His words were ""things always seem to get fixed faster when I'm on the troubleshooting call"" but had I disclosed it at the interview, he may not have hired me at all not giving me a chance to show my capabilities despite the condition."
"not during the interview 

I do tend to tell people, but I assess that once I'm working there and have got a feel for it.

part of why I tell people though is that it's **extremely obvious** to anybody with even a passing familiarity with ADHD"
"If there are drug tests involved, maybe, but I am sure there is a way to do it, without telling the employer."
Absolutely not
100% no
Other people don't understand
Drop it if it comes up in conversation but don't tell them for no reason.
"No, you don’t disclose"
"When you are hired, you can as for some accommodations or requests like be them being crystal clear in their directions and provide a deadline"
Absolutely NOT!
No
Not their business.
Gonna give a different opinion
I get the feeling it varies by country
America has pretty terrible employment laws and culture from what I have heard
I imagine it also depends on the industry
"

I live in Australia and I have been upfront at every place I have worked and it has always worked out really well for me.

Personally I find that it helps my anxiety a lot, as I don't feel like I have to constantly mask and hide my issues"
I can work with my boss to find what works for both of us e.g
"I generally agree with my bosses to take breaks more than the average person.

I am a leader, and I always disclose it to my team"
"I often have people opening up about their own mental health issues because I have opened up about mine.

I can see how it is probably a bad idea in America"
"But I don't think it is true everywhere.

P.s"
most countries have laws against discrimination against disabilities
Although that isn't always easy to prove.
No
Absolutely not
I wouldn't
They have no claim to medical information of that kind
"You're either a good fit for the job, or you ain't."
It is a protected class under the ADA so mentioning it may give legal protections
 I am not a lawyer though.
Absolutely not
"They do not need to know this and the only thing it will do is hurt your chances, unfortunately"
"

Imagine hearing from someone, either on a date, job interview, etc"
“I have a minor mental illness/disability but like… im on meds so it’s fine lol”
"

I know this is blowing it out of proportion, but that’s the optic to some people"
They don’t need to know.
No
Absolutely not
The only thing that matters is your ability to do the job
Bringing it up in an interview as some sort of disclaimer/explanation for your behaviors is a red flag
"Not because you have it or brought it up, but because you felt the need to “warn” me about it"
"

You don’t give warnings in an interview"
"The interview is where you show/find out how good a fit you are for the job and environment, and you can ask the questions you need to know if this place will be good for you without disclosing"
The HR office/email inbox is where you go to disclose such things while you are telling them the reasonable accommodations you need
"

Someone mentioned they said it in their interview and it helped likely cause the person also has adhd"
"That is the exception, not the rule"
"It has happened similarly where my bosses have had adhd and thought we’d work well together because of how mine shows up - but I did not need to tell them! They could tell and most importantly they could tell I managed my symptoms well enough that they wouldn’t be an issue.

You do not need to and should not disclose in an interview that does not have ADHD as a job requirement"
Ever.
Capitalism is not made to embrace your difficulties or to respect your human nature
"It's made to make money even if that means crushing lives, hopes, dreams and ethics in the process"
Anything that gets on the way of you making more money to your boss will be seen as a defect and will immediately get your CV in the recycling bin
"If you ever mention anything that could put you at a disadvantage against other candidates, you're literally telling them ""I have issues and you'll have to find ways to deal with them"""
"It's obvious they will prioritize anyone else over you.

Even if you only talk about it after you get hired, that will probably prevent you from going up the corporate ladder or giving you opportunities and responsibilities, because they will be afraid about your capacity to handle them.

Don't be dumb."
"if they don't ask, don't tell f♧ck em"
No
Autistic or adhd here
God no
They'll never hire you
"If you need accommodations, you tell them after you've got an offer letter in hand and after your few first days"
I've learned this the hard way
"They can't technically not hire you because of things like that but they can always just say you ""weren't what we're looking for"" or whatever."
"Absolutely not, you will not get the job if you do"
Start asking yourself: what is the outcome I want here?
I have never disclosed this to a workplace
No
Disclose when it becomes a problem.
Absolutely NOT
I got diagnosed 2 years after starting my job
My whole team has ADHD (except 2 people) and we all have talked about our meds and dosages and stuff
It's pretty funny
But I wouldn't have told anyone if my team weren't cool- I got lucky.
No
Lmfao
NO
You might as well not show up because they won't give you the job
"Also, if I feel like someone needs to know why I am the way I am (which is never going to be something I share in an interview) I tell them I have a learning disability or a processing disability or a neurological disability, etc"
"Whichever term best fits the situation, that's the one I go with"
"If I say ADHD, some people are understanding, but many will either take my diagnosis seriously and see me as a liability or not take it seriously and see me as lazy or dumb"
I'm not going to give them that opportunity
"Like, I can't get a commercial pilots license or work in ATC, both things I know I'd be great at even without the meds because ADHD"
"Why would I ever tell someone ""the American federal government sees me as a liability that could cost hundreds of lives"
"Job, please""?"
No stupid
"The world doesn't care, only what it can benefit from you."
Nope
so if i asked for accommodations for coding interviews am i cooked?
I tell people I’m autistic in an interview if it becomes apparent they are going to make me take a coding test (I’m great at my job but terrible at tests)
I find that admitting to Autism usually works in my favour and they will make allowances for me
"

I usually tell people at work I’m ADHD eventually but I keep it quiet until they know I’m good."
No because I notice they skip my application or if you telling during your job they lower down your hours and they fire you.
"No but I do tell things about myself that are a part of ADHD, not all the ""bad"" stuff but just things like ""I need you to tell me with no sugar coating if I make a mistake"", or ""I can get easily too absorbed in my work"" or ""I need directions given to me in this way"" because average people are never going to understand what having ADHD truly entails and even if they did, they wouldn't know how to help us get around the challenges unless we told them"
"

I HAVE casually told them later on after establishing a good relationship with them and after getting to know that they are open minded, but not everyone has coworkers or bosses like that, much less a healthy work environment."
I am very forthright at my current role
I even have workplace accommodations in place that allow me to keep the current flexibility that my manager has afforded me over the past 3 years
"This is to protect me from being re-orged to a shitty boss.

My ADHD diagnoses came after I had been here a while, and I only got diagnosed because I felt safe doing so.

I've long suffered from anxiety and depression though"
"And I have been up front with recruiters and HR ahead of the interview, and it usually goes something like ‘I am very confident in my skills and ability to rock this role, but I wanted to let you know up front that I have some mental health concerns that make this part of the process rough for me"
"It doesn't affect my day to day work, but interviews and tech screenings are extra hard on me’"
"To my knowledge this has never cost me a role, and to be honest, if it did, I wouldn’t be want to be there anyway."
Idk I see people on here saying no but when I went to my interview I told them and I also told them how I overcome my struggles and how I understand my weaknesses
"I got the job too🤷🏻‍♂️, the most important thing is being confident and being able to work with your weaknesses"
It’s better than being arrogant and not understanding your weaknesses that will eventually come out.
Not of your job entails lots of organization lol
I disclosed my AuDHD during the interview process
"I got the job and I'm still there.

It's been the least toxic and most accommodating workplace I've ever had"
"Not perfect, but as close as I've gotten.

I'll remain cautious about everything but so far every interaction seems to have been in good faith on their part.

When disclosing, I talked about my health management strategies, what work style works best for me (basically, I need structure, sprints and tickets/written tasks on a project board) and how I've found my AuDHD complements my field"
I think they liked my self-awareness and my proactivity with managing my disability
"It does unfortunately lean into that Inspirational Disabled Person trope but it worked for me.

If you can't be picky with your jobs though I'd be less open about it."
Absolutely not
HELLS NO
" 
Immediately signals, ""problematic.""  
And your resume/application immediately goes in the round, circular file for other people who said they had ADHD first time we met"
" 
DO NOT DO THIS, unless job your applying for is to study people with ADHD."
"I didn't explain it on the first interview, but once I could tell that I had made a good relationship with the owner (guy who interviewed and vetted me) I casually said ""oh yeah I'm a bit adhd, but that shouldn't be an issue"" and funnily enough, I've been commended for my productivity and punctuality at work"
I don’t
"My professional colleagues know me as someone who is energetic, artistic, and curious"
I lean on my personal strengths to keep my weaknesses contained
"For some reason, my ADHD lets me be organized at work like I could never be at home, which completely smooths out my attention/focus issues or hyperactivity."
"NO, DO NOT SAY BY ANY MEANS"
Even if they ask you about it.
I’m actually about to have a formal discussion with my boss as well as a senior colleague who I work with  closely
"BUT I’m coming at it from a specific angle - I want to improve my communication with my team and work more effectively with each other.

I am doing this specifically because they’d be receptive to it and are all about working better.

I’m in the camp of not everyone has to know this about me, and those I share it with it’s a privilege."
Depends on a lot of factors; do you want the job?
"IIRC, if you live in the US, ADHD is covered under ADA"
"So if at any point you do make it known to anyone, even HR, and shortly there after,  you are fired, terminated, or let go, it would be highly recommended to seek legal council"
"

Always remember, do not ever trust HR"
HR is not there for you
They are there for the company.
Interviewing while having ADHD is difficult enough! Do not disclose that in an interview
A good piece of advice that was given to me is that in interviews employers are looking for reasons to not hire you so the less you say the better.
"If you do, you are an idiot"
"No one else is responsible for the collateral of our symptoms, absolutely no company will take profit risks because you believe you need adhd accomodations in private working spaces"
The only scenario that would maybe be benefic are the ones that deal with  last second emergencies.
"While you're at it you should mention your sexual preferences, current living situation, and maybe your favorite memory of your childhood hamster."
"Ah yes, victim mentality will get you far"
"Okay, okay! don’t scream it scares me Dx"
"I’m genuinely confused about all the people saying no, but it also makes me aware that I’m probably very privileged and lucky about past experiences, the culture and my confidence"
"

My first reaction was that you should consider telling them for a few reasons"
"I never use my adhd as an excuse, but it helps a lot to avoid masking and crashing"
It helps me a lot that people around me are aware that my fidgeting or sudden bursts of energy has a cause
Something which I’m aware of and working on
"I don’t care if they judge, that’s up to them"
And says more about them than me
"It helps a lot to be transparent with close collaborators to make sure that we make the best use of when I’m the most efficient, and that I can sometimes take a break – no excuses but if I can’t focus then I’ll take a break"
"

I also think it’s important in terms of protecting yourself from people unintentionally hurting you"
"Which can be a lot, working in a toxic environment five days a week"
"

The other day I was working from a clients office, and two employees, a desk away from me, was talking about a famous person, assuming that they have adhd and starting to joke a lot about it"
"I didn’t really care, it doesn’t really bother me"
"But after sometime I felt that they were embarrassing them self, and I felt sad that if others in that big open office space were dealing with something for themself"
"So I joined politely into the conversation with a smile, and told them that I’m diagnosed"
"And then the conversation and room flipped around to talking openly about it, being a place for inclusion and respect"
"I think all of us should actively try to break down stigmas little by little, if and when we have a small surplus"
"But I also know that often it’s not worth the fight, and that I might be lucky in terms of industry, country etc."
"This!!! If you are struggling and do need formal accommodations speak to HR, not your manager"
I was laid off 2 months after telling HR I needed accommodations
All I asked for was clearer instructions because I couldn’t “guess” what my boss wanted
"I didn’t even say ADHD, I said neurological conditions."
You make a really good point
Thanks for that :)
"Quick follow-up Q, I created an alternate reddit account cuz I'm looking for work as a graphic designer (""Must be good at time management, attention to detail, juggling priorities!"") and just got an ADHD diagnosis"
I'm a bit afraid my socials might be looked at as part of the hiring process
"

Too paranoid?"
Employers forms hit as having to hire a certain amount of disabled ppl
" Are their any medical conditions that could be if it you due to that?  Or is it still a trap?  

Like IBS, or dyslexia for example"
What if the medication shortage causes you to be unmedicated some days
Is that something worth bringing up?
"Is this true even for live coding interviews? Because they're usually scheduled for late afternoon and can be 2-3 hours long.

This amount of continuous effort under pressure, combined with my meds wearing off around this time, erodes my attention span so much that by the end of it I can't even implement bubble sort if you ask me to."
Ahhh nothing like a reality check to make me feel depressed and hopeless about my ability to ever escape poverty
Heh.
Wow
You don't seem very empathetic or helpful to other people with ADHD
I'd agree though
Employers won't accommodate people with ADHD
A lot of the difficulties are very contextual.
"Also, google “goblin tools” - there’s even a time estimator that will estimate how long a task will take you, with a slider scale for how hard you find it to focus on that task."
"I wouldn’t try to score points, I’m just not trying to get weird looks or have people question my intelligence (for a lack of better words)"
I could tell my coworkers thought I was very dumb and slow at my last job because of the way they treated me vs others
Also sending hugs.
Sending hugs
"If it makes you feel better, I disagree with everyone here"
I found a way to market it as a plus but my field is very progressive
You can navigate your disability with obfuscation language to great effect I think
No but seriously sending hugs my adhd friend.
I can’t manage my ADHD but I would add that to dating profiles
"

This would make an interesting conversation, when do you tell a potential partner?"
"If they don't, that's a good reason to not want to work there in the first place."
That’s a good point
"I’m cooked! Dx I’m going to be doing front desk :( and I have the same problems you mentioned Dx I forget things even if they teach me how to use them multiple times (unless I mess with the software myself, but that software is usually private and expensive)"
"It sounds like the people you're working with have adhd or autism too, thus it's a positive to them"
"Thanks, I’m glad you figured it out and things are working out for you"
I already messed up when she asked for my availability and mentioned I’d have to leave early some days for therapy :(
I agree with this
"I disagree with them, but it depends on what your job is and how open they are to it"
I wouldn't mention it being adhd though
Obfuscate it in whatever way is convenient.
"Even then only if you test positive, then u can just show your script"
This makes sense
"If I were to (like really need to) do you happen to know if it needs to be diagnosed in order for it to count (in the process of it, but taking long)?"
I feel like I kind of messed up already because I told them I’d need to get out early certain days for therapy Dx I should’ve said for personal reasons instead
"Very good advice, actually"
Having a big heart means thinking that others do too Dx
This is GREAT advice!
You can disclose that AFTER hiring if you feel its necessary
HR here and this is absolutely not true
I posted a comment yesterday expanding on it.
Exactly
"If you have the interview, you probably meet the “hard” requirements for the job"
"After that, half of the interview is deciding whether I want to sit next to that person for the next five years."
That’s pretty passive aggressive of you
no
 Don't tell your manager or coworkers
" If you need accommodations (extra time on assignments, written meeting notes preferred seating, additional break), then work with HR"
" He has the responsibility to keep your medical info private, your manager and coworkers do not."
http://www.nooo.me/
"Not screaming, just trying to be firm"
To tell them is to set yourself up for failure
This isn’t school
Figure out the lay of the land
You might not even need accomodations.
Yes
In an ideal world
But this is not how it works for a lot of people
Sure
Some people might have an open mind
Probably a lot of them
But people's perception of you will change based on their views of ADHD
It is a chronic condition
And it brings a label that cannot be removed
Especially in a work environment
"

I am a firm believer in being open about mental disorders"
"Which is why I happily told anyone that wanted to hear that I had ADHD after my diagnosis.

The issue is this though"
Whether you want it or not
And whether they want it or not
Sooner or later it will bite you in the ass
You can mess it up yourself
Or someone else can also (falsely) attribute something to your ADHD
Either way
"At some point you will be reduced to the label.

You might be the best of the best"
Or the worst of the worst
Or make the smallest mistake ever made
Or pitch the brightest idea they ever hear
"They'll go ""this MF has ADHD"
"That is why X and X"".

If it were really a neutral thing"
Imagine this scenario
You and someone else are up for promotion
You are equal in everything
They decide to list the Pros and Cons
I can guarantee you on which side of the list ADHD will end up.
in the end it's a risk / uncertainty
"And people tend to avoid that.

Break all the stigma you want"
Name all the positive things about ADHD
End of the line
It's a chronic disorder that comes with a lot of challenges and struggles
"

Tell who you want to tell"
But don't tell your boss or manager
Ever.
"if you tell people at the **interview** stage, it's very easy for them to get away with discriminating for it in hiring."
"I’m with you, I disclosed my adhd as soon as I was diagnosed (I was in trouble at work thus the diagnosis)"
However I was also diagnosed bipolar and it took me a year to disclose that one
I was much more scared about that than the adhd lol if someone had a problem with my adhd I don’t wanna work there anyway because it shows me right off the bat what kind of close minded bs I will have to deal with.
[deleted]
In my experience HR is not your friend
You do see your mistake
Right? I can understand you probably felt the ADHD was not their business
"Saying ""neurological condition"" is way worse though"
It leaves them room to speculate
Their job is risk reduction
"So naturally, they will assume the worst"
"

Please just tell them it's ADHD next time"
If you have to go official
Be clear about it
You are identifying yourself as a risk
Make sure that they do not flag you as a bigger risk than they are willing to take
Even if that means you have to downplay things
"You can always go ""oh lol"
"It was worse than I thought"""
"But you will never be given the opportunity to say ""No"
No
You are wrong
"It doesn't impact me THAT bad""."
"Sounds like good riddance - for you!!

I guess you work in an at will state?"
If you must tell that you have something then you should clarify what it is
"""Neurological condition"" narrows very little down and make people assume you have something much worse than it is"
"I'm so sorry that happened! If you don't mind me asking, what were the accommodations you requested?"
"Did you have a written request from a doctor asking for specific accommodations for you condition? If all you did was tell HR you wanted accommodations, I don't think that would really carry much weight or meaning."
"I feel sorry for the younger generations that were given social media as children, before we had the cultural understanding of its effects"
"

What you should do, if you choose to have a social media presence, is:  

1) have an online persona that is “you”—this is the one that people find when they search for you on linked-in"
"Dissociate this from your college Instagram account where you’re going kegstands, twerking in a bikini on the table, etc"
"

2) have an “alter-ego” persona who is the “normal” you, and posts in your local subs, talks about pets and other things, but be careful to not give too much identifying information, so that someone who knows you would guess it’s you"
"

3) create separate identities for all of your other interests, shit posting, etc"
 so you  compartmentalize your private information and it isn’t tied back to you
"

For example, I have a linked-in, blogging, and professional forum identity all related to my job"
"

I have 3 Reddit accounts I use regularly (since 2008, I’ve had at least 7"
"one is alter-me, the other two segregate my interests"
"If you combined the accounts, anyone who knows me would strongly suspect it’s me based on my city, profession, education, etc"
"

I have 3 discord accounts, one for gaming, one professional networking, one for “other” interests"
"

I have 5 email accounts, tied to the personalities"
You’re not safe if some data-broker can tie your persona to the email you use for writing anime fan-fiction
Expect that email to show up somewhere: Lexis-Nexis was displaying the very first internet  email address I received in 1990 along with my current gmail and many in-between on my public profile.
Always keep your professional accounts separate from your personal ones as much as possible
" 

Failing at this is like failing to hold in a fart in a job interview"
" It’s embarrassing but not uncommon, and it might not have any consequences"
"

Still, if you wouldn’t be comfortable saying it at an office lunch, it’s uncomfortable to put it in writing on your professional account."
I have epilepsy but I've been medicated for it for 26 years and haven't had a grand maul in that time
I didn't know I was AuDHD until last year
But..
I still won't mark that I'm disabled because it's not worth risking
" I would say it was a good idea but sadly, it's a trap."
I've never worked for a company who has a disability quota
Maybe more so on the government side? Those EEO forms are for metrics they can report on and nothing more.
Yes I would in that case
But it's still not a get out of jail card
If it happens multiple times you may need a note from your doctor
"

Don't be surprised if your work product is subpar they request you take FMLA if you and your company qualifies or short term disability if you have it."
You can tell them but that opens you up to a ton of bias
you will have no way of proving that they didn't hire you because you disclosed that
"As the candidate you control the schedule, just let them know you aren't available at certain times."
It sucks that we have to work harder than other people at things that come so easy to most
"It is possible though! Im 41 and it took me longer to get to my position than other people, but I did it!"
I'm trying to explain how the laws work so people go in understand what the expectations are
Folks think because they announce they have a disability they are protected and BY FEDERAL LAW that is very untrue and it ends up hurting them in the long run
"I also have epilepsy and I see people time after time on the subreddit here losing their jobs because they didn't request an accommodation but would just not show up for work because of their seizures and end up losing their job.

Employers CAN accommodate ADHD --I've done it a ton! But you have to bring the accommodation to them and there are limitations"
"If you say you just can't remember things and therefore miss deadlines, that could damage the company -- cost them late fees, revenue, reputation"
If you can't be at meetings on time you are impairing your coworkers from doing their jobs
"There are SO many accommodations that can be made, but using a blanket symptom and saying well I can't get in trouble because it's a disability is categorically untrue."
HEY...do the best you can
"NO ONE is as harsh a judge on us as we are to ourselves !

RELAX.."
and make Friends with your interviewer(s)!
"They wouldn't treat you any better if they knew why that was, they'd probably just see it as an extra layer of incompetence.

Find a place that allows you to excell at your own pace :)

You may take a minute longer than they'd like, but that don't matter so long as the result is worth the wait."
You tell it when you start an actual conversation and getting to know each other…?
True
But it's hard finding a job as it is
Having ADHD just makes it worse.
"Take notes! Taking notes has helped me so much!  
If a customer has a complex issue: Take notes! Now at the end of the interaction you can double-check with them that you got everything right"
"No chance of forgetting, and the customer can confirm that they don't need anything else!  
Take notes while being trained! This also helps with recall, and now you have a reference!  
It doesn't directly help auditory issues, but repeat back what the customer is asking for"
"""Okay, so you want help with \_\_\_\_? I'll be happy to do that for you."" It demonstrates that you're listening, and gives them a chance to correct you if you didn't quite get it"
" 
As far as trouble speaking, customer service is pretty scripted"
"After doing it for a bit, you'll notice that most conversations follow the same script"
"It always took me by surprise when a customer asked for something new!  
A lot of working around ADHD is working around individual problems"
"Instead of just accepting ""I'm bad at this because of my ADHD"" instead try to think of it as ""I have to do this differently because of my ADHD."" I always take notes when given verbal instructions, and repeat back my understanding of the instructions"
Because I struggle with verbal instructions
No one has acted annoyed about me..
trying to better understand them
"But if you just wanted me to \*just remember\*, lmao that's not happening."
I hope you find something similar 😊 (Preferable without the drama I had haha)
Be careful
Many out there don't see eye to eye
Don't lose your job because of it
Stay safe.
Which part? HR will always do what's in the best interest of the company

 https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/career-advice-qa/hr-doesnt-exist-to-help-employees"
You are very correct on your interview sense
"All interviews basically boil down to ""would I want to work with this person"""
"Ya,  I'm from Seattle with a Swedish family"
 Passive aggressive is basically my love language
"I was one of the fortunate few, my manager figured it out entirely on his own BUT he only figured it out because he also has ADHD so we both keep it on the DL and we look out for each other"
"By all means though, don't tell people."
You can also ask for some accommodations or mention you struggle with something without linking it to adhd
"

Like „I have trouble remembering X type of thing, can I/we do Y to make sure I don’t forget?“

Rather than  „Because I have ADHD I have trouble remembering X type of thing, can I/we Y to make sure I don’t forget?“"
It’s not always possible
Accommodations need manager input in my role.
Why was I not told THIS 🤦‍♂️
"Here's a scenario that is basically described in the post:


You and someone else are applying for a new job"
"You both seemed equal on paper, but then you disclosed that you have ADHD"
"Nobody who interviews you knows you, so who looks like a better candidate for the job now? "
As I said a lot of times: I am aware of my privileges and I’m very aware of the challenges and struggles
Also aware that what I’m actively searching for might be an utopia
"

I’ve witnessed on my own mental health how exhausting and damaging it can be to not be open and transparent"
"

I can only speak for myself and I’m not gonna advocate for anything"
"Because you’re right, it might harm your career being labeled"
"Personally I would rather succeed talking openly about my challenges and struggles than risking another burnout caused by masking and pretending.

This applies to anything, not only a diagnosis"
It’s easier for everyone to navigate personal difficulties if they know the cause
"If a manager will label me for my diagnosis, then it’s not an environment I would see myself in anyways"
Again… This is a privilege and I understand that the majority is not in this position
"

I think your world view is first of all; correct! You are right.."
And it’s dark and conservative
Stuck in the past
The world doesn’t have to be so black and white – always
"  
  
Imagine this scenario: You and someone else are up for promotion"
You are equal in everything
They decide to list the Pros and Cons
"They decide that your transparent and open communication about your ADHD, or struggles and challenges, values you as a great candidate for the job"
A teamplayer who is performing even while having challenges
But also a person who is actively seeking help and is working on improving and takes themself serious
They know a lot about you in comparrison to the other candidate Average-Joe
They also take into consideration that there might even be ways to make you an even better candidate
By being good managers and figuring out if you have any needs which will make you even more comfortable in the job
They see a greater potential in you and hope that giving you more responsibility and flexibility will make you perform even better
They believe in you and will try to enable your talents even more
" 
  
Again… I know this is not how it is in most of the world or industries"
"But try to imagine, and try to make little efforts for improvement"
If and when you have the surplus and can do it without any risks.
Yep
"I’ll tell coworkers who I have enough experience working around to know how they treat/feel about people who they consider “different”, but I’ve been burned by multiple Boomer managers who still associate ADHD with the  “hyper little boy knocking things over and yelling” stereotype"
Good point and very true
I completely missed the job interview part… Whoops
Never disclose anything which has a risk of being perceived negative at a job interview
I agree.
Do you really think they are going to tell you they are discriminating against you because of your ADHD
That’s not how real life works
Much more likely you get passed over for the promotion or viewed unfavorably and the reason is never articulated to you
"You’re right, they’re not"
You’re not looking for a friend or validation at work
"HR is there to protect the company’s interests, which includes making sure that they comply with the requirements for how they treat employees."
"they’re not, but if they’re good at their jobs they’ll help you with accommodations to avoid a lawsuit against the company."
"True, they are not but it’s their job to make sure the company is following the work laws"
So I’m sure they’d be much happier to accommodate someone’s needs than getting a work lawsuit for discriminating someone for their health issues
Providing necessary accommodations for employees who need them literally makes them more productive
It should be in their interest to do so because employees being productive is good for the company.
"You are correct that HR is not your friend, but what they will do is uphold the law"
"I know every workplace is different, and I know there are certain laws that vary from location to location, but in my experience, this is one of the few things that they do fairly well, because the potential for lawsuits is so massive if they don't."
There were a lot of assumptions made here
"Because of how bad my manager was at communicating, answering questions, and assigning tasks, I was literally not able to do my job because of him.

For example, when I was just starting out working there, I had next to no training and nobody went over the codebase  best practices with me"
I was working in web development
When I asked him specific architectural questions he would answer with things like
"“well, how do you think we do things here? For the entire year every time I would ask a question (after exhausting myself trying to find the solution and asking other peers) he would always make me play these guessing games"
As a person with ADHD I need direct communication
I cannot work under that circumstance
I also work just fine alone and typically don’t need a lot of help once I’m shown something one time
"But he refused to show me, even in the first weeks"
"

Fast forward to the end of the year"
He would berate me and ask me why I did things in a certain way
Me: “Because you wouldn’t accept my meetings to clarify your setup with me
"You told me I was being disruptive by asking questions to my peers.” I was asking peers one time, not repeatedly"
And after exhausting all other options
"

After a huge project didn’t get delivered on time because he was on vacation and nobody in the entire company knew the correct place to put the code I had wrote"
"I ended up going to HR not to attack him, but to say I can’t work without direct communication"
"I need an accommodation of written instructions, clear one-time examples, and better feedback from my managers"
"

I hope that this gives more context to you"
Canadians don’t have to divulge our reasons for accommodation
We give a doctor’s note that is general to back up our request.
"I'm going to need everyone telling this person that ""neurological condition"" is ""worse"" than ADHD to cool it"
"Are you saying that someone with a ""worse"" disability deserves to be fired? Further, it's not even incorrect."
No
Canada.
Montana is the only U.S
state that doesn't have at-will employment
In Canada disabilities are covered under the privacy act and we don’t have to divulge what the condition is.
"I did have documentation from my doctor and submitted it, yes."
Holy guacamole this must be an absolutely legendary kink you have
"> I have 3 discord accounts, one for gaming, one professional networking, one for “other” interests

So you're a huge degen, got it"
"

Why the fuck do I need a ""professional"" Discord account? If I have to communicate with my employer via Discord, I'm quitting.

No work-related social media is one thing, I've personally seen people fired over things they said on Facebook"
"Work communication on Discord though? Piss off, no."
"Cabin in the woods it is! 

But seriously, thx!"
"Okay, I've wanted to ask someone this for ages"
"I'd really appreciate some advice-

I would like to do YouTube videos, but I want to keep my identity a secret because I have a psychotic ex who would probably leak revenge porn of me if I gained literally any internet fame"
"(Yes, it's illegal where I live and I'm trying to alert the police, but if he leaks it, it's over"
"Even if he's arrested) So, that means it's pretty crucial that I don't get doxxed or have someone leak my identity"
"I thought about making a new account obviously, but because of the way Google connects fuckin _everything_ on your computer to itself, I'm worried it would be easy to ascertain that my YT account is connected to my personal account"
"I'd have to keep track of the password so that I don't have to enter a recovery email or phone number, but idk what else I can do apart from getting a completely separate device (which seems overkill?)"
I have epilepsy too! Over ten years without a seizure
Don't even consider a disability anymore.
Good to know
It's true
But it sounds like you're advocating more for your company than the employees
"And like I said, the problems with ADHD can be contextual"
It's not as neat as getting a note for noise cancelling headphones
It has a lot to do with interpersonal relations
"

Nothing you said would make me feel comfortable going to you for an accommodation.

What type of ADHD accommodations have you provided and were they helpful for the employee?"
"Very true, cheers :)"
"I've always taken notes during meetings (even if they weren't important meeting) or training, and always said it helps me remember better even if I never looked at the notes again"
"I was diagnosed 2yrs ago and now it makes sense.

I also recently read something about when you have to focus on one thing like a person talking in a meeting, you have ""too much focus"" and that's why it's so difficult"
Taking notes is like a version of fidgeting
"It takes some of that focus away from the part of the brain used for listening and give it to your other senses allowing you to better focus on the primary task, which is the speaker"
"

I'm going to go look for what I read to link because I'm sure it just sounds confusing lol."
This 100%
"When I was taught office stuff, I'd have a notepad where I'd scribble in each step, I would also use my phone to take a picture of each new change on the screen to make my notes easier to reference"
"I'd never say I have ADHD, I'd just say I don't want to miss any steps and stuff anything up, so I do this to make sure you don't have to teach me again tomorrow"
Nobody has ever given me a hard time for putting in the extra effort to remember instructions.
"SHRM is a racist organization which just removed ""equity"" from their playbook"
"I wouldn't trust anything from them.

HR advises the company AND employees what rights they do and do not have"
"I'm not HR for anyone on here so I don't see why you think I'd be ""for the company"" when the company in this situation is irrelevant."
None of the mentioned things could stop a candidate from performing well in an interview
"However, informing them of a condition that could stop you from performing well in an interview for a job you are qualified to do, only seems logical."
"I had a manager who I can only describe as an Elite ADHD Boss while I, in comparison, was a basic ADHD"
He still picked up my adhd quick as lightning
ADHD people have freaking ADHD radar I swear lol
It’s not always possible so don’t sweat it
I’m in the process myself and had to disclose it to my manager and had to get a doctor’s recommendation even though I asked for mediocrely normal stuff 🙃.
And this is why you should never disclose
"Get the job, prove you can do it"
"If (later on once you proved you can do the job) you decide to share your diagnosis to help others explain why you rock at some things but cant do others, then do this.

But I have ADHD and - as much as I hate to admit it - I know that I would question hiring an ADHD person because of my own realisation that I cant be trusted to do some things that just need to get done"
"  
  
And it's not rational, the things I do well I do extremely well.."
but the things I miss can often be important.
Are you saying discrimination will be the problem instead of your eligibility? There are other disabilities that people have as well.
Exactly
If you need accommodations I don’t think you should shy away from it.
"work is hard and there’s a reason the ADA exists!! 

if they fire you because of ADHD related reasons and didn’t disclose it there’s no legal recourse you can take, but if you provide a doctor’s recommendation for accommodations and they fire you then you can at least try to sue their asses."
[deleted]
"Sounds like you had a shitty manager, possibly at a shitty company/department"
Sorry you had to deal with that
:( Too many folks get fired when their manager is the real problem.
I think the issue here is that your manager was actually bullying you
I've seen this before
It's covert and subtle so it's hard to pick up
"I had this with a manager where she would never give me a straight answer, but as the person who decided ""what success is"" it was frustrating to never be told what it was before hand"
Eventually I broke down after she tore my work apart and tried to pretend she had no idea why I was upset (because she did it with a calm professional voice and never swore or used rude words)
I was moved teams and have been fine since
"

It *may* have helped to be more specific"
But I think your manager had it out for you more than anyone here has realised.
Thank you for the additional info
"And while my post was based on limited information, I do not believe that the context you provided changes the essence"
Its HR job is to actively identify (potential) risks to the company
"By speaking up, you put yourself in the picture.

By being vague about your need for accommodation, no matter how much you are in your right, it put you under additional scrutiny"
They assumed the worst case scenario and put you in the 'batshit crazy' box as this covered their ass the best
Your skewed performance reviews further strengthened the idea that you were a risk
Including the feedback they received from your manager
"All they needed was to find a valid reason to fire you.

My first advice would be to never disclose your ADHD"
My second advice remains that if you have to disclose it for whatever need to downplay it to the max
Big corporations do not care about you
Nor are they likely to provide a safe environment
All most of them care about is the bottom line and their investors
Any threat to that
"And you are out the door faster than the time it takes the average ADHD person to change hobbies.

Don't get me wrong"
I am on your side
My advice is nothing short of me wanting you to succeed
I completely understand that you did not want to fully disclose your diagnosis
Nor do I believe you should
My point is that there is a difference between what I believe and what I see as the harsh reality.
Thank you
"As far as my personal medical documentation and the DSM, ADHD is categorized as a neurological / neurological developmental condition"
😂
Do not mistake your disagreement with my words as a mandate to dictate what I can or cannot do
I have little patience for those who presume to tell me what they 'are going to need' from me
This is not kindergarten
You are not the teacher
"I would appreciate it if you treat me as an equal.

You are twisting my words"
Which is both unhelpful and disingenuous
At no point did I say or imply that anyone with a disability deserves to be fired over it
My post isn’t about ranking disabilities; it’s about addressing a specific situation.
Oh wow I can't believe that you can get fired so easily in Canada?
Professional networking = programming discords & slack accounts
I’m with you on communicating with employers on discord
"

I keep that separate from any ID I use to discuss anything political, religious, etc because I don’t want there to be overlap in those areas of life, it is of no benefit to me."
"Would you not even show your face? 

Don't do it if you have any reservations"
I have a TikTok account that only had a few thousand followers at the time..
"The only thing on there is my first very common name, I never talked about where I work or even the industry, I didn't put my location"
I made a vague video saying managers should listen to HR when they warn them an employee may leave (bc it had happened to me that day) and an employee at my tiny 30 person company at the time saw it out of the millions of f videos posted on the app
Fortunately she told me and no one else but I could have easily gotten fired
"

If your face is on it, it's never going to be secret."
That's awesome!!
I'm speaking in generalization because 99% of companies probably don't have a head of HR with ADHD who can help make suggestions
"It's going to depend on the company and the job but I have gotten employees flexible working hours (doesn't mean you can miss or be late to meetings though), ability to work from home, outside coaching, work with their manager to show them how to give them definitive tasks, a request to follow up all verbal meetings with email"
"

But this isn't going to work for every struggle someone with ADHD has"
It isn't as black and white as a disability like using a wheelchair
"If you have a job with shift work and you are chronically late, that isn't something they need to accommodate"
"But if you have a hard time waking up you can request an accommodation for afternoon shifts.

If you are assigned to XYZ project and you still can't turn it in on time, asking for no blame is not an accommodation"
You can request shorter timelines and more meetings with your manager to make sure you're staying on task
"

And some are just things we have to work harder than others on"
I have a horrible time with impulse control but I still can't interrupt my peers when they are speaking
That is not an accommodation
"I work extremely hard every day to be aware of it and it's exhausting.

And none of these things are up to HR in the end, we can only make recommendations and trust me we are ignored more often than not"
"If they want to get rid of someone the call lies with the manager, head of that department, maybe even the owner or CEO"
"They don't even check with us when they want to terminate, they ask a lawyer"
"We just get the unfortunate task of scheduling the meeting and handling the paperwork.

HR relies heavily on retention and employee engagement metrics"
It's in our best interest to keep employees on and make them successful and happy.
Sources?
What world do you live in where living situation couldn't impact your ability to work consistently? Not to mention the trauma of hamster death...
"After I got diagnosed and began to learn the many faces of ADHD, I have silently diagnosed  several of my co-workers of having ADHD"
Most of them do not know they have it.
"Can 1000% attest to this, I've met so many people in college and a solid 85% of them probably have ADHD"
Yes as people with ADHD we know with certainty the downsides of ADHD
In the scenario I described I would also hesitate to hire the ADHD person
I imagine for somebody like the spouse of an ADHD person they might be even less likely to hire the ADHD person.
ADHD is legally considered a disability and is protected under the ADA
"At least in the US it is.

So idk wtf you're on about"
I wasn’t asking for advice though 😅
I was saying I would never disclose or ask for accommodations again.
"I'm extremely surprised to see people up your ass about this terminology, especially in this sub"
"I think there's a major resistance from a lot of people with ADHD and other mental illnesses to see themselves as ""disabled"", simply because of the societal phobia of disability."
I am using a colloquial phrase to disagree
You are the one being condescending
"You are talking to u/gringogidget like a child - 

>You do see your mistake"
"Right? 

Further, you are being condescending to me as a retaliation of my perceived condescension"
"You tell me ""do not mistake"" in the same breath that you tell me not to tell you what to do, and to treat you like an equal"
I speak to my equals this way
"If I wanted to condescend, I would use the extremely ""teacher-y"" tone you have decided to use, instead of a casual one.

And I am not twisting your words.

>You are identifying yourself as a risk"
"Make sure that they do not flag you as a bigger risk than they are willing to take.

You literally implied it is their fault they were fired for being too big of a risk"
"

Not to sound like a jerk, but I am literally shaking as I write this reply"
"You claim I was talking down to you, but I was trying to speak like a friend"
"Your comment is so mean, and I am so upset."
It’s all done below the belt and they cited another reason for layoff
"They said there wasn’t enough work, which wasn’t true"
Then they have me severance
"Not too bad, but stung me enough to not ask for accommodations again."
"Ah, so industry-specific"
Fair enough.

Same
It's annoying that there's so much stigma because I can see for many people it would change their lives if they knew
I can see one manager has it
"She's even sympathetic to me because her son has it, but it's never occurred to her that she might have it too lol."
Sure
"I missed the job interview part… 

But depending on the industry, job position, culture and what so ever"
"One might as well hire the person with a diagnose, medication, methods and self-awareness, than another candidate with a lot of other possible struggles or hidden challenges.

A lot of factors and a lot of approaches"
"

Some large corporations in my country even favor people with diagnoses or challenges for certain positions"
Positions which is considered good and honest jobs
"They are aware of the personal benefits for the employee, and therefore the dedication and the possible longer running relationship there’ll be"
Mutual benefits
Compared to employing the freshly graduated person who is already on the lookout for better opportunities.
I have ADHD
There is no way I can suppress the need to hurl myself into a conversation and interject some unsolicited advice
But fair enough.
Thank you ❤️ you get it.
"I think what he says is, management is not your friend, don't give them information they're going to use against you"
"He may not have expressed himself correctly, give him the reasonable doubt lol"
Not as industry specific as you'd think
I do some casual work for a property management firm that has mostly remote workers
"Discord is the easiest way for us all to talk, while having a record of it all for others to reference if need be."
You deal in a lot of absolutes it seems.
"I like to assume the best, but this commenter doubled down multiple times.

Further, they did not give me any ""reasonable doubt"" and decided to berate me over a pretty commonplace phrasing they perceived as condescension."

I fully understand this and I also get absolutely nothing done all day after school
I don’t know how to fix this but I’m sorry this is also happening to you
I hope you’re doing well man.
Getting on medication has helped some people with adhd 
"Medication and therapy , it’s worth a try"
Omg same
"It feeds into my procrastination because every tip I get is ""just do one small task"" - mfer if I could do one small task I'd do the whole thing, it's getting started I can't do 😭 Do you also only get things done if you have many, many hours available? I used to go to the gym - every day of course, because that's the reasonable way of starting a fitness journey 🤦🏻‍♀️ I had to stop because some of the courses were at 4pm, and I got nothing else done those days, because I'd get up, shower, be ready by say 11AM, then in my mind I thought I need to start getting ready for the gym at 3:15PM, and somehow that just wasn't enough time to start anything, so I did nothing except go to the gym"
"I'm so jealous of people who can look at 30 minutes, and use that time appropriately. "

EDIT:  a bunch of people have asked for specific links and I just responded with Amazon short links because that's what the share thingy gave me..
Some of them might be removed though because I've been notified that's not ok
"When I have time to sit at my laptop, I'll add clean links for the specific things I bought in my list, but honestly if you search for the terms like ""shower clock"" or ""pill bottle last opened"" you should be able to find them"
"Super happy that my suggestions have been helpful to others! 

______________

I am so stealing this idea"
"I'm tired of bumbling around in the dark!

I have a few things that really help me at home though I'm not sure if calling them hacks is overkill:

1"
Digital assistants / Google Home in most rooms
"Pulling out my phone to check the weather, the time, or my calendar almost always results in me getting distracted by something else on my phone and forgetting to look up what I meant to"
I like that I can just shout my request into the air and get an answer
I also use it for timers and reminders and created routines to remind my ADHD kid in several intervals when it's time to start getting ready for bed
"


2"
Clocks everywhere
I'm time blind
I also take a really long time with showering/makeup/hair because I have no concept of how long I'm taking
"I used to play music and try to keep things to a certain number of songs, but waterproof clocks have become an even bigger help"
I have one in the shower and one attached to the mirror over the bathroom sink
I also have one of those giant text clocks marketed towards people with dementia on my work desk because I often forget what day it is on top of what time
"So it says in huge letters ""WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON"" and then the time and date"
"


3"
Wastebaskets everywhere
I got this tip from a book for ADHD people but I cannot remember which one
"But the author had pointed out that instead of trying to force our habits to fit our environment, we should try and adapt our environment to serve our habits and behaviors"
"The shower is not near the wastebasket next to the sink, and as a result I would leave empty shampoo bottles, drain hair, old razor cartridges, etc for ages"
I got a second bathroom wastebasket and put it right next to the shower so it's within arm's reach
"Now things go in the trash! Likewise my kid was always leaving snack wrappers and misc garbage on a side table in the living room, so I put a nice-looking wastebasket right there"
"Now it goes in the trash! 


4"
Pill bottles that tell you the last time they were opened
I can never remember if I actually took my ADHD med or just thought about it
I bought some pill bottles on Amazon that reset a timer every time you open the cap
Absolute game changer.
I always start laundry and don’t finish it
Most of the time it’s because I get distracted and I forget
So recently I’ve been shoving a dryer ball in my pocket (they’re kind of pokey and big) and I’m not allowed to remove the dryer ball from my pocket until I have completed the laundry I started
I now get at least one or two loads done a day!
"*Clocks everywhere in every room.

*Small random empty stands in every room"
"So that whatever things I throw and forget randomly can be searched easily later without losing my mind.

*When have to leave house to do some task, I first start with taking 2 mins to get all the items I have to take with me, and all the keys of course, put them in living room table or near the entrance door table (I know we all had tons of times we forgot vehicle/house keys)

*Do whatever we can if it can be done in 2-5mins"
It helps a lot
"It helps normal people, and us even better"
"Because after 5 mins we will completely forget about it for like a decade.

*Keep water bottle near to us, and maybe in every floor and every room"
"It changed the game to me

Anyone found any solution to phone gadgets and tv addiction?"
"Perishables like produce in the door of my fridge (more visible), condiments in the drawers"
"If I need ketchup I’m gonna go looking for ketchup, but I WILL forget about those strawberries I bought 3 days ago if they aren’t super visible"
Makes finding a snack easier when I realize I haven’t eaten all day too.
Garbage cans all over the place
"Anywhere that junk tends to accumulate.

Multiple laundry baskets for the same reason"
I have a small basket right near the front door because I like to take off my socks as soon as I get home so they don't collect cat hair
"

Hooks instead of hangers"
Less work
"

Get only black socks so you don't have to worry about matching pairs"
"

Don't fold any laundry that doesn't need to be folded"
"Toss underwear socks, etc in drawer without folding"
Only fold if it something that you wear that's visible and that wrinkles
"

Multiples of cleaning supplies in every room so I don't have to leave the room to grab the required item"
"

Keep things where you use them"
"Bedsheets in the bedroom, not linen closet"
"Mugs beside the coffee and the coffee maker, not with the plates and bowls"
"

Clocks.

Have a large tote that you keep with you when tidying up so you can toss in anything that doesn't belong in that room"
Then put the items away when you're done
As opposed to leaving the room every time you find something that doesn't belong there to put it away then you get distracted
"

Corral small items like your skin care products on a tray so that when you have to clean the counter you can just move the tray instead of having to pick up each individual item.

Avoid unnecessary decorative items"
They collect dust that you will have to clean and they are also a barrier between you and dusting whatever surface they occupy
You can get pretty versions of necessary items to act as decor
Like a nice napkin holder or whatever other household item you need to act as decor instead
"

Keep your cleaning supplies out and visible to remove the barrier of having to go into a closet or cabinet to grab them"
 Plus seeing them out will remind you that you need to clean
"If they are ugly, you can try to get nicer versions like decant your bathroom cleaning spray into a nice glass spray bottle or get a wood broom instead of a plastic one.

Edit: I learned a lot of this from the book [Organizing Solutions for People with ADHD](https://a.co/d/bOMCjf0)"
I have lights set up in my house to change color depending on I should be doing
"

Bright white/blue to wake me up 

Natural white to work 

Blue/green for lunch time

Amber for winding down in the evening 

Red for bedtime"
"

(The red and blue thing helps particularly as they’re some of the cues your body use to judge when to sleep)

And I have pink and blue for sexy times but that’s just for fun"
😆
Just wait until you get hyperfixated on Home Assistant like I did
"

You'll have pressure sensors under the mattress in no time.

Edit: I can't spell."
All keys are on one lanyard
"I put all things that I need together, in one space, near the door"
"Shoes, lanyard, backpack, yeti, lunch, etc"
"All in a box near the door.

If i have something that needs to go upstairs (i.e"
"restocking TP upstairs, clean towels, clean sheets), i put it on the stairs so that I take it up with me.

Force myself to do dishes before bed"
"Empty dishwasher/hand-wash big dishes while my breakfast is cooking.

Do NOT sit down until it is safe to potato.

Do NOT go home (esp do not sit down) if I have plans in the evening.

Frequent, smaller grocery shops and call boyfriend to confirm i have everything i need for dinner.

Have pets that force you to function"
"My dog is a better alarm clock than my phone.

Trash bags & cleaning supplies on every floor"
"I have 3 magnetic white boards, so I can externalize my brain"
One next to my computer on the wall
I put my to do list and things I want to remember there
I only have to turn my head to the right and I see everything
Also there's one on the wall where if I look a little to the left I can see everythign I wrote down
"Ideas, things I want to remember"
"

And then a calendar whiteboard that I keep in the hallway"
"

Anything I can do to give myself permission to forget is my favorite."
I take the doors off my coset so I can see my hanging clothes
I no longer fold anything that goes in my dresser drawers
(If it needs folded it gets hung up) I keep all my daily work clothes in an open basket next to my dresser
Socks have a bin in/on my shoe rack
"I currently use a bookcase as my pantry, which has been great being able to see my food"
"And instead of organizing groceries by food type, I sort and store by meals/things to be used in the same meal."
"# My ADHD Home Hacks:

* **Automations** \- for lights that come on at sunset and turn off at bedtime, timer for bathroom fan to go on at times I generally have a shower"
"I also have a salt lamp on a timer to be on from sunset to sunrise so that it's like a nightlight in the bathroom.
* **A lip balm in every zone** \- I bought like seven Aquaphor lip balms - one goes on my nightstand, one for couch side table, one for each and every purse I use, one for my work bag.
* **Multiple Context Alarms** \- For every work day, I have an alarm to wake up, one backup alarm, a get-ready alarm, and a time-to-go alarm.
* **Logical Homes for Home Items** \- coffee mugs go above the coffee maker"
Coffee goes beside the coffee maker
"If I want to remember to take a vitamin, I put it where I'll see it.
* **Garbage Bags** \- I fold about 10-20 garbage bags and place them at the bottom of the garbage bin"
Then I put a new bag in the bin
"I never worry about leaking garbage so that's not an issue, but I don't have to worry about friction (when a simple task is difficult due to too many steps which makes you not want to do it) when taking out the trash.
* **Shower Sponge** \- I throw a Scrub Daddy sponge down onto the floor and use my foot to clean the bathtub while in the shower"
"This sponge is easily accessible WHERE I WILL BE USING IT on a shelf with my toiletries in the shower.
* **Shower Squeegee** \- I squeegee the walls after a shower"
This prevents me having to clean the shower and it's fun
"Squeegee is stored in the bathtub hanging from the showerhead.
* **Standing Dryer** \- If I stand at the dryer and fold there, I will fold and put my clothes away"
"If I dump dry laundry in a basket, I accumulate multiple loads of clean laundry and it will never get put away"
"Sometimes I do use the basket if I am tired and I give myself some grace.
* **Kitchen Sink Handsoap & Dish Pump** \- I have a kitchen sink hand soap dispenser because I hate washing my hands with dishsoap (sensory), and I save shampoo pumps and use them on my dishsoap dispenser and it's way faster and easier to wash dishes.
* **Five Minute Speed Run** \- New game I started playing where I set a 5m timer and I try to speed run putting stuff away"
That's it
"Because it's a *game* I don't feel like I have to do it, and it creates momentum to continue if I want.
* **The Everything Hanger** \- Got annoyed having to fold so much and so often so I bought a tie and belt hanger and I use the hooks for bathing suits, tank tops, bras, underwear, bodysuits"
Life's so much easier now

I'm sure I've got way more than this list, but that's all I could think of for now"
"I try to always make my life as easy as possible because life's already hard enough as it is.

  
ETA - another item to the list !"
"Adderall, Wellbutrin, Google calendar, Alarms, my wife, my backpack full of creature comforts, andddd being medicated"
Did I mention being medicated?
I did the same thing! Magnetic motion lights that stick right to the metal bed frame lol
"Counter space is more valuable than any other aspect of your home.

Have a counter or shelf of some kind in every room if you can"
"Close to the door and roughly waist high.

If you set something down, it will be incredibly more likely that you'll set it there over somewhere else where it's easier to lose.

Now you always have only a small handful of places to look for your keys/ phone/ cup/ what have you.

Now, if someone has a hack for keeping those counters clean, I'd love to hear it."
"I forget to switch the laundry, so I keep my cats food near the washer and dryer so that at least once a day I will have to go into the laundry area, which helps me to remember when I need to swap the wash into the dryer"
"Also, I fill the dish detergent compartment as soon as I empty the dishwasher so that if I am unsure if the dishes in there are clean or dirty I just have to check if there's soap in there or not."
I use my phone as a grandfather clock
It announces the time every half hour
Great for time blindness.
1) doubles of personal care items that I routinely forget/lose
"Most doubles go in my bag because I'll forget to use them before I leave for work, others go in my nightstand or my desk so that when I remember them I wont have to get up and therefore  end up distracted and on an epic side quest"
"

2) the routinery app"
Keeps me on track while getting ready and doing chores.
I only keep two of each cutlery and crockery items in rotation in my kitchen at any one time
That way I have to clean them up as I use them
"

(I live alone"
If you live with another you might want 4 of each)
Laundry is really the only thing I have a hack for
Everything else is a mess lol
But I have a hamper for clean clothes and a hamper for dirty clothes
"And when I do get the motivation to put my laundry away but not enough to fold it, I got one of those cube organizer book case things with the cube fabric boxes and just throw a certain type of clothing into each box (shirts, pants, socks, etc.) and call it a day."
"Multiple laundry baskets!  And a floordrobe, as I call it - basically multiple clothes baskets in lieu of a dresser"
 My husbeast folds my clothes and pops them into my floordrobe
 Occasionally I'll put it away but if I don't it's fine
 They're in the closet under his hung up clothes and I find things just fine
" :)

And don't worry, we are even"
" He does laundry (and honestly a lot of the day to day stuff), I do deep cleans and house projects like refinishing a floor or building the deck"
 We both have ADHD and luckily our strengths align.
I find you come up with the best hacks when you admit that you won’t just miraculously get better at remembering to do things or out of sight not being out of mind and ultimately try to just outright remove the need to remember
"

Some of them are easier / cheaper than others"
"On one end of the scale, I buy (sometimes rather expensive) things to help save me from myself"
My most recent purchase was a heat pump combination washer / dryer so that the clothes will be done in one cycle
No more will I open my washer to find stinky clothes I washed a day or 2 ago and forgot about
Bonus points as it has a dispenser you can fill up for detergent and a smart app to start it remotely
"

I’ve taken a similar approach to most household appliances that I could"
"IE: Smart robot vacuum that can also mop, will self empty, empty dirty water, clean mop pad and then fill back up with solution from reservoir.

I also have a coffee machine that has a grinder attached that is smart and can be set to auto brew or done via smartphone / Siri"
If only I could also get it to empty the old coffee grind (but now I’ve made it a hard rule to dump it BEFORE I make my coffee)
"

Also know that you don’t have to start at the biggest and best / most expensive one (especially if you can’t afford it)"
"I love freshly ground and brewed coffee, but I had a keurig for years since it was cheap and allowed me to get coffee at home because it was fast and easy (forget going through the process for a conventional coffee machine)"
Though being able to afford the machine I have now was a big goal / stretch at the time and celebrating those wins makes me push harder
"

On the cheaper / free end of the spectrum, I try to give myself rules that will prevent me from building up a task list or letting me forget"
"For instance, I won’t go downstairs and leave my bedroom until I’ve fully cleaned it up"
Any dirty clothes that I’ve thrown on the floor before bed I take and throw down the stairs (I can’t walk down or I’m not coming back up)
"A lot of people may do things like put hampers in their room, but I find that just creates more out of sight / out of mind and builds up a future task list or things to remember you’ll forget about"
I do the same for empty water bottles or really anything I have to take downstairs that wont break throwing it down them first
"I do have a small trash can in my room that at a minimum I throw any garbage into, but I also try to make it a habit of bringing that down with me when I go (especially if full / near full)"
"

Other things are trying to avoid putting things in cabinets or behind closed doors / out of sight"
I also try to locate things near where I will need (or remember) them
"For instance, I have daily vitamins or supplements lined up on my counter in the kitchen near my cups / glasses (which are also next to my refrigerator / water dispenser), not in a medicine cabinet in my bathroom"
Melatonin gummies are on my nightstand (can’t be pill form because sometimes I’ll forget water)
"

Things that aren’t part of a normal routine and have ad hoc / specific uses are what I relegate to cabinets or hidden storage"
"Instead of putting condiments in the highly visible shelf when I open the refrigerator door, I put them in the produce bin, because when I need ketchup, mustard or whatever, I know where it is and will get it"
I now have prime real estate for all the fresh fruits or veggies I buy that used to go bad before I remembered I had them and ate them
"

While I’m not really sure if this is an ADHD hack or not, I also try to remove or limit choice wherever possible"
Clothes for next day are laid out and ready the night before
I’ve found those meal delivery services like hello fresh were also fantastic
I picked the meals I wanted and it shipped all the ingredients and recipe cards and I just followed it
All I had to pick was which of the meals I would have or prepare that day
"With that said, I got a bit tired of always cooking so I paused it"
"The premade meal options they have now is interesting, but rather expensive"
I’ve been experimenting with AI and apps to essentially develop something similar I could do on my own when wanted
"IE: Pick a few meals, asking it to generate an ingredient list and suggest order to eat them in to minimize waste for freshness for a given week, etc"
I then use this in combination with reminders or daily calendar scheduling (IE: Put in what I’ll have each day and the recipe and stows to follow for it)
"Siri intelligence getting better has helped a lot, cause I can naturally and quickly verbally ask it to do more complex things it wasn’t able to do before"
"If I had to go into calendars and record everything myself, it wasn’t happening"
"

I know that was a lot, but I got hyper fixated and excited sharing, lol"
"If you made it this far, hopefully this helps spark some ideas or help some others out."
I always forget if I turned something on/off or whatever when I leave the house
So I knock on the wall 3x or do something weird to celebrate that it was done
"I will forget if I turned off the thing, but I WILL remember my celebration."
"About an hour before bed, I sit in a comfy chair, slightly reclined, and let my brain race."
"Small baskets in most rooms- I get overwhelmed when shit is all over the place so we got baskets we can just toss things in that don't belong in the room, end of week I gather the baskets to put things back in place"
"Small dry erase boards in the bathrooms, kitchen, and laundry room- when we notice something is running low we can write it on the board so when I make my shopping list I don't forget a million things"
"Master dry erase board in the kitchen- I write down what's going on this week and the following week, our dinners for the week, shopping list, to do list."
I took the doors off the kitchen cabinets that have food in them
All food visible always
No more “what should I make?” And forgetting about everything I have.
"I take my clothes out of the washing machine and hang them straight on hangers to dry, so I don’t have to hang them on the line, then onto hangers."
White board on the fridge
Throughout the week my wife will write stuff on there that needs to be done or I need to buy and it helps tremendously
"

It’s not that I don’t want to tackle those things"
"It’s just that I forget, especially the ones involving rooms I don’t spend a lot of time in"
Out of sight out of mind
"

Honestly that’s been my biggest ADHD pro tip"
"Recognizing that I’m likely to forget about things I don’t have to literally walk past, and creating ways for me to have no choice but to notice them (like the white board.) 

Tip on a similar note; have something you absolutely can’t forget to take with you when you leave? Either leave it with your keys or leave your keys with it."
"I hang almost all of my clothes, what can't be hung up goes in pocket organizers"
I found ones that fit on bifold closet doors that I'm forced to deal with for now.
I have WhatsApp chat with myself
I use it as a to do list mainly
I also share flyers of concerts etc
in there
It’s pinned on top of WhatsApp so I always see it
When a task is done i can erase it
It’s not the end all be all solution but nice to have.
"I bought 5lb wrist strap weights and put them on everytime I need to fold clothes.


Killer shoulder work out"
"I fold it all on the table then switch the straps to my legs.

Since I speed walk, it truly puts some strain in my steps and helped give me the V shape.

Everyone hates folding, my work around was using this as a way of working out so it's a symbiotic relationship and works fantastically"
I have all the same kind of sock so I never have to pair them.
Adderall
Investing in a full second sheet set
"Pillows and all
On Sunday I change the sheets and I have a full clean set ready to go, no putting them in the wash and then inevitably forgetting and being faced with a bare mattress to make when you just wanna go to bed"
"

I toss rhe old ones in the laundry and have a full week for them to eventually end up washed 

Rinse and repeat each week"
"3 laundry baskets.

1 for dirty and urgent (underwear, uniforms, socks)
1 for dirty and non urgent (towels , sheets, whatever)
1 for clean clothes you just took out of the dryer but don’t want to put back"
The clean basket alternate with one of the dirty baskets.
- I don’t really use the drawers in my fridge unless I’m out of room
"One my lady moves in we will probably start using them tho cuz she will absolutely remember 

- I started utilizing the reminders app on iOS devices"
"Getting an Apple Watch has been a game changer, I get all my reminders on my wrist and I’ve made it a mental game to check the boxes off when the task is done"
The fact that I can just immediately speak to my watch to set a reminder as well is fantastic
"

- in the same vein I started using the calendar for events so I know when I’m booked"
"If it’s something small and soon I don’t really use it but if I know it’s something I might double book in the future add it!!

- setting an actual routine, if I don’t have structure I fall into chaos and will just do nothing as soon as I get home"
"These also use the reminders app but the biggest point about this is we need routine, otherwise you will let yourself down"
"Bed time, time slots to work out, hygiene slots, meditation, wake up at a certain time everyday"
"

- changed my schedule at work, I was doing 6am and 7am shifts for so long thinking it was great getting off at 2:30 or 3:30 but I’ve come to realize, I’m not the type of person that can get up that early, it just ruins my day and starts me on a bad foot"
"For the 8am shift it’s perfect, I can stay up to a reasonable time and not feel like I have to go to bed at 8pm to feel well rested and I get up at 630am which is damn near my normal wake up time when I’m off"
Consider your work schedule and adjust if at all possible
"

- this might be obvious but important thing I need to get done get left where I can 100% see them"
Out of sight out of mind
"Also set a reminder lol

- in terms of a relationship, just talk about your feelings and what is difficult"
The other person will just get frustrated if they don’t understand where you are coming from.
"I have tile/key finders on both my keys, purse, cats and phone"
"Saves sooo much time trying to hunt down my phone because I can usually find a cat, a key or purse, push the button and it finds my phone and vice versa"
"

Also on days I can't be bothered to finish putting my laundry in the dryer, I open the lid and stir it around/drape a good hand full outside the machine"
Reduces how stinky laundry gets if I don't finish for whatever reason
I also moved my cats main water dish right next to the sink where it can be reached by the sink sprayer so easy to refill
I also have multiple boxes of disposable gloves so I cut down on how much I wash my hands while cleaning up
"

Not sure if it's an ADHD hack but I use multiple hampers"
"One is designated for clean clothes only, 1 is for stuff from the car and 1 is just mish mash , and of course the biggest one is for dirty clothes"
"

I'm not good at changing my bedding but I figure that if my bed linens fall off from me tossing/turning/getting in and out, it's time to change them"
"I average about 3 weeks, not the best but I've heard worse"
"

I also walk my cats outside 1 to 3 times a day so they not only get entertained but also cuts down on how much I have to clean the litterbox"
My boy favors dead leaves and the girls go potty in the box outside I have sometimes
"

Disposable plates/cups/silverware is obvious"
Also an electric kettle only filled with clean water cuts down alot on pots/pans/coffee makers/etc when you just need to make something simple.
"My wife has complained for years about me leaving shoes / slippers / socks next to the couch in our living room.

The core problem is that I'll go to sit down, take off what I have on my feet, then forget.

I've been joking for years that we need a couch with a sock drawer.

This summer I finally decided to do something about it.

We have a small 2 person chair next to the couch - I tore back the upholstery, cut off some of the structure, rebuilt the bottom, and then put back the upholstery.

For slippers there's a shelf on each side, including one I can access as I walk towards the couch to stash them when I go to sit down.

For shoes / socks, there's a drawer in the middle you can pull out when you go to sit down to put on shoes or take them out

It's been wonderful and left me wondering if there's an untapped market for practical ""storage furniture""."
I have a setting on my WiFi router to turn off the internet at 11pm.
Load the dishwasher as you use your dishes
The sink will pile up in no time and finding the motivation to do the dishes can be a challenge.
"Living small & not owning many stuff.

Now you have less space to lose stuff on and less stuff to lose.

It's also less work to clean."
Waterproof alarm clock hanging in the shower
💯💯💯
I can not believe I’m the first to say this but paper plates
It keeps the sink clear (or close to it)
When the plates stack up the sink sits full for a week
But if I only have to wash a pan and some forks or something it’s much easier to stay on top of it
Felt wasteful at first but honestly since I live alone it doesn’t equate to that much waste and is an absolute game changer for keeping my kitchen clean.
I have a shortcut on my iphone for when I misplace it
"When I say ""hey Siri where are you"" it says ""at your mom's house"" so I can hear where my phone it"
I have those digital clocks for elderly people with massive numbers (they’re like 6 inches x 10 inches) always in my line of sight
Like I have multiple in every room I spend more than a few seconds/min in
"

People who visit our home think I’m visually impaired because of it

lol"
I announce where I’m putting something
“I am placing my keys on the table with intention!” It’s annoying but it works
"Same with my reading glasses, cell phone, and kindle"
"If I can be in the moment, I won’t end up putting something important in the freezer."
This dude going to f****** the boogeyman's whole game
1
"A hamper in/outside of the bathroom to immediately put laundry into when stripping to shower.

2"
"My meds live where the mug sits for my Keurig, so I have to pick them up to make my morning coffee"
There is also a water bottle that sits next to them
"

3"
"I use the drawers of my fridge for beverages and condiments, produce goes on the door"
"

4"
Hooks and bins by the front door
"I need a “dump station” to be able to hang my coat, my bag, my keys, and put other random things that I’m often taking in/out of the house"
"Otherwise those things get strewn everywhere, cluttering my space, and I can’t find half of them because theyll never be in the same spot twice"
"

5"
Google Home + lamps with dimmable lightbulbs
"Being able to turn on/off lights from my bed is amazing! 

6"
An extra regular sized trashcan lives in more of my main living space
"I have one in the kitchen, but having a trashcan in my main living space is also just SO helpful"
"

One of my biggest ADHD/sensory struggles is showering and it is ALWAYS a battle to motivate myself to shower
Reducing some of the barriers has been a huge help
I have a lamp in the bathroom for softer lighting
I have a waterproof wall mount for my phone so I can watch TV while I shower
"I am VERY picky about shower gel so I allow myself to splurge on shower gel I love.

8"
An airtag for the car so I never forget where I parked.
I finally decided to get a washing machine that also dries the clothes automatically
It cost too much money but I found myself needing a new washing machine and was finally able to get one
Gone are the days of forgetting my wet washing and needing to do it again
Now I can forget about my clothes in the machine for days and it doesn’t matter because they’re dry when I remember them
"

I think it’s probably less efficient than two machines, but hey you know what’s REALLY inefficient? Doing the same load of washing 4 times"
"Honestly, my at home hack is my wife.

She somehow knows where both my phones, iPad, computer, and meds are at any given time"
"While I’m over here losing more things trying to find one of them lol

I guess opposites do attract?

But in all seriousness, I love AirTags"
They’re killer.
"I have Alexa’s around so I set timers and reminders 

I have clocks everywhere I spend time cuz my time blindness has gotten me too many times 

The fridge door thing I’ve seen multiple people write here 

Trash cans in every room - the big kitchen ones for all rooms but the bathrooms

Toothbrushes in every bathroom and in my shower
Shower chair - I swear it’s a game changer

I have hand sanitizer everywhere- I have OCD and dirty hands is hard for me so it’s a barrier to me eating"
"the sanitizer helps me solve that 

Snacks everywhere in the air tight containers so I remember to eat"
1
"A clock right in my face on my desk and near my bed
2"
"Lights and fan controlled by remote Bluetooth control from phone so I can just immediately switch them on or off or customise the lighting
3"
"Keeping a running task list notebook or planner open at a focal point on main desk

So happy to learn more from the comments on this thread :D"
"Post its, especially for important dates"
"I keep them in my studying space, but when the date approaches, move them to the kitchen so I’ll be more aware."
 Two toothbrushes- one in the shower and one on the counter top
Setting little alarms for myself on my phone throughout the day if I get adhd stuck.
#Someone on reddit suggested a “house purse” and now i have one too
10/10 would recommend.
"You can put settings in Google calendar that automatically adds alarms to anything you put into the calendar, so I have set mine to give me a 1 week, 1 day, 3 hour, 1 hour and 15 minute alarm for everything I need to do."
"https://a.co/d/43zhFhP

This book has helped me with quite a few areas of my place"
"I don't employ everything, but there are a few that have really helped me, like labeling the edges of my drawers, etc"
"Plus, there are pictures for easy visual reference"
I even bought a copy for my little brother and another for a friend with ADHD.
House full of ADHDers
We have a basket/milk crate in common rooms to collect random items that belong somewhere else
Instead of rando crap everywhere we have a clutter of rando crap in the corners
We have one for small items on the counter as well
More than not they stay full until over capacity or someone digs in to search for something. 
"Putting organizational tools where I'll use them, not where they ""should"" be"
So a craft cart by the couch for my laptop and current knitting project
Stuff in clear bins so I can see it
I use Android Auto to send reminders and notes to Google calendar and Google keep.
"I, 33M, shave my beard in the shower"
The idea of shaving and having to clean the sink afterwards literally deters me from doing it
So I have a hand mirror in the shower now for this purpose
"Never thought to do that for years on end, including when I was in the Army and had to shave everyday."
Spare house key in the car just in case I lock myself out.
"Tile trackers on everything (remotes, keys, vape, etc)"
I have finally found a way to keep track of all my things with Tiles and the app on my phone
Life changing!
i learned over the years when i get home from work i can’t sit down or that’s game over
so i always try to do one or two chores before sitting down so it’s less build up
"

I have smart lightbulbs and outlets cause i forget to turn off lights, fall asleep with the tv going etc"
everything it programmed to shit down at a certain time everyday
also have smart thermostat so i don’t forget to turn down the heat at night etc
"
when i replaced my washer and dryer and last spring it links up with the app so i get notifications on my phone when somethings done if i don’t hear it go off."
Et wife started putting things in my way so.id.do them
Want me to fold the laundry? Put the hamlet I
"Front of the couch! Want me.to take out the recycling? Leave ir at at the top of the stairs, blocking my way out the door"
"

She used to getad at me for putting things out where I'd remember them for next time"
Now she's take on this power!
"I’ve also gotten disposable everything - cups, plates, bowls, cutlery, sometimes those baking plans, straws etc 

I have regular of those too and when I have the ability I use them"
But sometimes you just can’t do it and fuck it
Amazon is killing the planet more then my red solo cup
I have a trash and recycling bin in almost every room
And the recycling bin is a big tote
"

The fewer times I have to empty it, the more likely I will keep on top of it."
"I used to have a motion sensor light in the hall way cause I'd always forget to turn it off before I sat down, so that helped me get out of the sit down get up sit down stage for a while"
"The other thing I use is about a 15"" bowl on the counter to throw anything I need to have access to without putting it in a drawer because out of sight is out of mind"
"So keys, sunglasses, mesuring tape, pens, etc"
"No rearanging of furniture, becuase you forget and if you're not paying attention boom, ouch"
"Laundry gets done by item, out of socks then all socks get washed etc I don't wait until a hamper fills up"
It's wash on demand not schedule
I use Alexa alot
"I use a food prep glass bowl to stage my morning meds, I line up each pill bottle next to it as I put one in the bowl and I leave the bottles there until the time is well past after I've taken them and do the same thing at night"
The bottles get moved from that postion back to their starting position to the left of the sink
If I get distracted making my breakfast I'll know if I had bypassed taking my meds.
"Google calendar that buzzes my Fitbit and tells
Me what to do"
Repeating tasks on your to do list just simply for the reminder and satisfaction of checking the box if/hopefully when you remember.
I love automation! Can check all the things from my phone after I go to bed and the turn off the lights! Also I have hue lights that are set to change color so I know what time it is!
"AirTag on keys, wallet and work access card."
"Motion sensor lights are such a smart idea! For me, the [Pillo app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.rtrvr.pillo&hl=en) has been a lifesaver"
"It’s perfect for tracking meds because it not only reminds you to take them but also keeps a log of when you did, so you’re never second-guessing yourself"
It even lets you adjust reminders if you take something late or need to change the schedule
"If you’re like me and tend to forget things easily, Pillo makes it so much easier to stay on top of medication routines"
Highly recommend giving it a try!
"A place for everything and everything in its place… for things like phone, wallet, keys otherwise I was the day looking for one thing, then finding it just to completely forget where I just had it"
Like my phone?
"My hack to prevent constant stubbed toes, ware crocs around the house always"
The one day I couldn’t find them I stubbed my toe so bad I had to ice it.
"Any important physical document I receive (business cards, phone numbers, etc.), I take pictures of on my phone immediately because I just know I’m going to misplace the physical copy"
This has saved me so many times!! I also love the search function in photos on my iPhone because it makes it so much easier to find what I’m looking for
"

All of my keys (home, work, car, parents’ keys, etc.) are on one lanyard"
"Is it obnoxious? Yes, but I never misplace my work keys like my coworkers (they have two sets of keys, personal and work)"
I also have every key I could possibly need at any point
"

I bought command strip hooks and placed them in my dining room"
"As soon as I come home, the first thing I do is put my keys on the hook"
Sometimes even before I take my shoes off lol
"I never misplace my keys (unless my husband uses my keys because he never puts them back on the hook lol) 

I also have a specific location where I put my work bags as soon as I get home"
"If I take my wallet out of my work bag (usually on the weekend), I will put my wallet back in my work bag as soon as I get home"
"This makes it easier so I don’t lose my wallet but also, everything is good to go on Monday morning.

I always keep my morning and afternoon medications in my work bag"
"On the weekends, I will take my medication and put the bottle back in my bag immediately after.

I take my evening medication at the same time every night"
I have reminders on my phone but they’re not very helpful
"What is helpful though, is looking at the clock to see it’s 10pm or almost 10pm and that’s an instant reminder to go take my medication or to watch the clock because it’s close to 10pm.

I am notorious for leaving clothes in the washer and for forgetting to put them in the dryer"
So I usually have to rerun the washer so many times
I will text my best friend that I put clothes in the washer and she either reminds me or honestly just writing it down helps to remember
I also send an update when I put the clothes in the dryer
I also sometimes tell my husband and have him remind me of the clothes.
Motion sensors but got cats.
“Notice and Do” sessions with a timer
So many things I notice but don’t do - so this makes time for that
"(Learned this from The Lazy Genius, who learned it from someone else.) 

If something keeps landing in one spot, change your storage so you’re almost there"
My kids have drawers for shoes in the kitchen near their backpack cubbies
I have a laundry hamper in the laundry room for the socks that end up everywhere
However - I will REGULARLY find 4-5 pairs of my own shoes under my work desk
Have mercy on my crazy brain.
"My home hacks are:

Separate clean laundry baskets for all the family

Reminders set for changing duvets/water filters, putting out the bins for collection, taking medication, when to leave to collect the kids from school, appointments, etc"
"

Getting a cleaner in every fortnight"
"If anyone has an idea how to remember you put food on the stovetop and not to walk away and go do other things, lmk 🤣 I should use a timer, but i would forget that too"
"Manipulate yourself.

Don't want to clean out the dishwasher? Just tell yourself you only need to do one plate, that's easy, that's quick"
Once you've started it's far easier to keep doing and funnily enough this work even though you know you're lying to yourself.
I have a basket underneath my mailbox so that I can immediately throw away all the junk mail and it doesn’t sit in a doom pile in my house
"Then I just empty the basket each week on trash day since it’s on my way to the bins.

I have another basket in my room specifically for clothes that are not dirty enough to need washing but that I’ve worn once and don’t want to put back in my closet"
"That way I don’t have random piles of clothes on the floor or my doom pile chair.

I really love baskets!"

Auto lock deadbolt on front door.
"Is there an ADHD hack that comes with a free personal assistant that makes all your appointments, remembers things for you and does your laundry.

I want someone to take care of ME for once"
Cuz god knows ICANT.
I leave my keys in my car in the glove compartment
"Since I park it in the garage, there is no risk of l car getting stolen"
No more misplacing keys
"

I store items that go together in close proximity to one another"
"Example - I love candles so wherever I have one that I frequently light,  I store a lighter or matches in the cabinet directly beneath the candle"
"

My medication is sorted into 2 pill dispensers, which I put in my bathroom on the counter near my sink"
"I take my Adderall immediately after brushing my teeth, and since I'm in and out of my bathroom, I'm bound to see my pill dispenser, which reminds me to take my Zoloft in the afternoon."
"My bedtime trick is I have smart lights that go on in various rooms at sunset, but then shut off at 11 pm, along with my digital assistant reminding me it's 11 pm and maybe go to bed soon."
I'm in love with ChatGBT lately
"I just used it to plan my entire Ireland vacation, I'm about to use it to give me a wardrobe breakdown too."
I have a simple home automation that turns off the lights and other unnecessary electrical devices when I leave the house
"The mantra ""keys, phone, food, wallet"" before I walk out the door everyday."
"For me it is all about streamlining and organization - basically making basic things as easy to do as possible with as few steps as possible, and not moving things from one place to another"
"

A lot of this entails buying multiple copies of things unfortunately"
"Call it ADHD tax, but if you can afford it up front if you have 3 of a thing then it takes 3x longer to wear each one out, and you always have a backup.

* dont just have one charging cord"
"Have one in each spot that you commonly charge your phone (on the couch, at desk, on nightstand) plus one permanently in your bag/backpack/purse"
"You’re never without, and never looking for a charging cord"
"Earbuds - I have one dedicated to my gym bag, one for work, and one at my desk"
"Etc etc.

* streamline basic systems so they are easy to do in fewer steps"
Store replacement garbage bags right next to the garbage can
You can unroll 5 or 6 bags and fold them over the edge of the can so they aren’t sitting at the bottom; when you take a full bag out they are right there
"Now you don’t go digging in the closet for the new bag, forget halfway thru, and then go 2 days without replacing your garbage bag and letting bits of trash stack up because it’s too mentally taxing to think about digging the garbage bags out from way under the sink… ask me how I know… TLDR keep high priority, more frequent things in the most easy to access places.

* get some wall mounted key hooks and put them RIGHT NEXT TO THE DOOR"
Always put them there - they’re already in your hand when you unlock coming in
"I never lose keys at home - they’re second I travel somewhere, I don’t have a regular spot to put them, I’m back to losing them all the time.

* Also, charging station right next to the door"
All plug types you might need
"This way my bike lights, headlamps, battery packs, earbuds, watch, etc are always right there and charged"
"I guess I have a lot of doodads to charge

* good organization that is ACCESSIBLE"
"If it’s too hard to put things away, it won’t get done"
Clear boxes are important to me so I can see what’s inside
"Can’t be stacked up in the closet - moving more than one other thing to get a box out is too much.

* multiple bags/backpacks for different purposes, pre-loaded with stuff I need for that puspose"
E.g
travel bag already packed with travel charger & travel toiletries and other travel specific stuff
"A pouch with running stuff I can throw in my work bag (headlamp, gels, soft flask, shorts+shirt, clip it  to shoes)"
Gym bag
"For me, packing takes a lot of mental overhead and finding stuff, getting it out, etc so the more of that I can have ready in advance, the better.

* Streamlined laundry system"
Dedicated place to hang dry stuff (or easy to set up) close to wardrobe/dresser
"I found this thing on Amazon that’s a wall-mounted, retractable clothesline"
"Mount on wall, then on the wall opposite it you mount a little hook"
"Just pull the cable out and attach to hook, instant clothesline, breaks down fast so you don’t have permanent drying rack or something making clutter.

* generally keeping things uncluttered makes me just FEEL so much better"
"If it’s messy, everything is harder and all that stuff out in the open is taking up mental energy"
"If I have something taken out and set on a surface somewhere but “haven’t got to it yet,” (for days/weeks…) honestly I’m probably not going to any time soon and it’s evidently not that important"
So I try to just throw it in a catch-all bin so at least it’s out of the way instead of making everything else in my life harder
"This is just about being honest with what you are truly going to get done, and just getting rid of all those momentary flights of fancy for projects/tasks you came up with"
E.g
"getting something totally unrelated out of a closet, you notice your old collection of Pokémon cards and think ”I’m totally going to organize those so I can sell them” and you take out the box of cards and it sits on your table for 3 weeks"
"You think about it every time you see it, beat yourself up for not having time, and it makes using the table more annoying for everything else the whole time it’s there"
I try to work on being honest with myself and just put it away
Write a task down in a notepad app if it makes you feel better.
I've started really leaning into using reminders on my watch
"I always wear it, and it's extremely low effort to hit the crown and do ""hey siri, remind me to \[insert thing here\]"" and now if it tell it date/time, it'll also go onto my calendar"
(thank you IOS 18 update)
"

I also set alarms on my watch"
"One for 5 minutes after my alarm clock goes off, one for when I need to stop couch rotting in the morning to get ready to leave, one for when it's time to head out to team meeting, time to go home; I use the timers for my breaks and lunch"
I also use the timers for when I'm doing laundry
"I've gotten MUCH better about not leaving a load of laundry to rot in the washer since I started doing that.

While mine is an apple watch, I'm pretty sure most smart watches can do similar :)"
Autopayng bills is the best hack I use
Open top bins and washing baskets
"I used to use a large bag for washing but I'd never put it in, I'd always just throw it on top"
Same with bins (except not food bins)
"Have to open a lid? Nah, goes to the side of the bin.  It seems obvious now but I struggles for years with this lol"
Now I can just throw stuff in and I've never had washing or rubbish on my floor since (...mostly).
I have a pill organizer case that has individual removable snap-top boxes for each day of the week
One door for morning and one for night
I only take pills in the morning so I can fit two weeks’ worth in the same organizer (meaning I only need to fill it twice a month)
I stay at my partner’s 3 nights a week so small and portable was paramount
"When I take my meds for the day, I flip the little compartment for that day over so the day name is not visible"
Meaning I don’t have to open the box to see if I took my meds
"I’m less good at taking the little gummy packets of vitamins but I always take my pills! 
I have a small travel toiletry bag with needle and thread, yarn needles, tiny scissors, lip balm, hand lotion, floss picks, a pen, hair clips, liquid IV etc inside for use at both my partner’s and my own house"
I now remember to floss at least 60% of the time when watching tv and knitting
"

Leggings hangers in the closet for t-shirts (arched with ten strong clips) for when I’m inclined to actually hang up clothes"
A hamper for clean clothes and a smaller one for dirty which forces me to do laundry more
"

I just bought vacuum seal bags for all my yarn and am about halfway through making use of them"
I made sure to pack them in only one layer so I can pick up a bag and see exactly what’s in it
The bags go in cube basket ikea shelf cubby things
Space is extremely limited in my little house
Next will be fabric
"

A basket just for seeds in the garage"
I have a binder with clear pockets that I put seed packets in at the beginning and end of garden season but I WILL NOT put them in throughout the season so one dedicated basket keeps me from losing and finding seed packets in random places
"

Visual cues for doing dishes"
"3 person household so we all take turns, and we have a little laminated sign with all our names and a clean/dirty magnet"
"

Keeping all-purpose cleaner wipes under the kitchen sink and also under the bathroom sink"
I clean the bathroom a lot more now whenever I think of it
"

A dish in the bathroom for regularly-worn jewelry and a jewelry box elsewhere for less-worn"
I’m a silversmith so I have a lot lol
"

I was only diagnosed two years ago (I’m 42)"
So a lot of stuff is self training/adapting that I was forced to do before I knew I had ADHD
So my routines are well built in by now
I used to be annoyed by it when I first got diagnosed but now I see that I’m a “learn the hard way” person and so I kind of appreciate it now? And then getting diagnosed and making peace with it has made me allow myself to work WITH the way my brain works with some level of understanding instead of berating myself for how my brain works
"Be kind to yourself is my best advice! I can’t take stimulants rn due to an inhalation injury at work (I’m a welder) which makes my pulse high, so have been without my meds for 7 months"
"Repeat after me, “it is what it is”!"
*I have my car keys on the same carabiner as my apartment keys
That way I can't start my car without my house keys and I can't leave my apartment without my car keys
Super helpful because I detach the apartment keys from my main lanyard when I walk the dogs to have fewer things in my pocket
"

*I put my condiments in one of my crisper drawers instead of my fruits and veggies to help remember to eat the fruits and veggies I buy"
I'm also going to rearrange it so leftovers and items that perish quickly are on the top shelf and things that I will go to the fridge for specifically will be in the spots that stuff gets lost in usually
"

*I keep my med organizer in the kitchen in an easy to see spot so I don't forget to take them"
"

*lots of notes on my phone

*todo list app that can do push notifications, repeat Reminders, and schedule due dates"
"It let's me see what i have due today and when I make them off, it will keep a tally of how many items I got off my daily list"
"I can also see the items that are scheduled in the future either as one big list, or by each day that has an item due"
"

*each of my purses that I have in rotation has its own lip gloss and lense wipe so if I swap bags, I just have to grab my wallet and put it in the one I want to use."
"Taking clothes out of the dryer, if I do not fold them as I'm taking them out, then it's game over 😭

Lol it makes it so I actually put them away!"
Alexa everything
Dump boxes
"I have a plastic basket tub thing in the kitchen, dining room and upstairs"
"If I need to tidy something away but I’m not near that location, it goes in the dumping boxes to be sorted later"
"It gets sorted maybe once every 2 months, but I usually know to look in these boxes for certain items, making it easier to find lost things, but also my ‘crap’ is contained to the boxes making the place feel tidier."
A brightly colored phone case
If I put my phone down I always put it with the back facing up
"When I look for it later, I can never notice it if it's just the black screen facing up but it's easy to find if I'm seeing a turquoise or bright pink case."
"Apple Watch, iPhone"
"Apple reminders, calendar, notes, alarms"
Lots of great advice here already so I'll just add a darkroom
Preferably a little soundproofed too

I realize not all of these are clear cut home improvement hacks but they're good so I'll share anyways"
They have motion-sensor night lights
I got a free one from my new electric company when I signed up for service
They are in stores.
2 Giant magnetic full month calendars on the fridge that you use white board markers on
Directly in my face as I open the fridge so I can't forget
"They have sort of become part of the furniture now so my husband has taken over writing on it, but it helps him to remind me.

I bought 4 pairs of the same earbuds so I dont have an internal frustration meltdown when I get into bed everynight and realise I've lost them and have to get up and look for half an hour when I'm tired"
"In the evening, I take some pills before bed"
" When I do, the pill sorter goes onto my keyboard where I am pretty much guaranteed to see it when I get up so I can take my morning pills."
"Not sure what color the lights are that you use but I got some led lights from Amazon that are blue and the light is way less harsh at night, I can still see perfectly in a dark room but it doesn’t wake me up nearly as much when going to the bathroom"
My wife has ADHD far worse than I do
Makes me feel positively “normal” some days.
I have things like my iron and hair straightener plugged into a timer that automatically switches them off
Game changer
"Sort of off-topic, but what a beautiful, loving partner"
Do you lend him/her to people?
Wtf that is so touching and sweet...
"That's such a great idea, stealing it."
"Apps that announce the time, especially when you’re trying to get out the door https://apps.apple.com/us/app/1timer-voice-timer/id1357874791"
I run small loads of laundry and dishes
It's much easier to unload the dishwasher when there aren't many dishes
"Same with clothes, I fold the laundry as I take things out of the dryer"
 It's easier to talk myself into getting these chores done when the job is smaller.
One of my favorites is to have a “drop zone“ (this is in addition to one of my personal favorite hacks of having a full-size rock climbing carabiner to keep all of my keys and similar items in one place) that can be attached to a belt loop
"(USB drives and two FA physical authenticators as well as house, keys and car keys and anything else that you use on a daily or semi weekly basis) My “drop zone“ is where I put those keys along with my wallet and literally everything else I need before I leave for work"
As long as my car‘s keys are in the same pile as all of my other “important stuff” I’m basically guaranteed to not forget about it existing
Not a bad idea to use a basket or something similar if you have one to store everything.
"As other mention, Apple Watch."
I invested in home automation
I found a way to integrate different home automation systems to the point where it updates settings on my phone
"

I have motion sensors for some rooms like bathrooms/restrooms"
"Basically, if it detects motion between certain times, it will reactivate the lights, if it doesn't detect motion within 5 minutes, they turn off"
"

You can even set up ambient light sensors"
"

I have both always and google displays"
"So it helps me with notes(usually thoughts/ideas and shopping lists), it reads my schedules (mostly work meetings since I WFH)"
I can also set up automation for timers
"So I can say ""hey Google, focus time"" it'll trigger settings on my phone like DND"
"Then I have other automation like ""break time"" where it sets a 15 minute timer"

Everyone told me to get special mats that trap kitty litter, so they don't track it everywhere"
"Never got any, because walking on kitty litter is such a nightmare, I'd rather vacuum twice a day"
"Also, STICK VACUUM! Soooo infinitely more convenient than one you have to drag around"
"A partner that does all the laundry, dusting, window cleaning etc"
for me.
"It's multi factor: Partner, myself, and two children are all ADD/ADHD.

Got partner a tile bundle for Christmas"
He was unhappy
"But now it lets him make the block when he forgets his work badge, wallet, car keys, or phone"
He now says it's the best gift
"We got the kiddos tiles for backpacks, violin, and other important things"
"

Then Alexa: our dogs run for dinner for the Alexa alert"

Also, when they were younger, I would bargain how many books to read, then read my ""two or three,"" then put Audible with a classic"
"

I was also working full time and in grad school full time, so we would also do homework together"
"Yes, I got nothing done, but I taught them study habits, and helped set the example"
"So while I did get frustrated, it was also good to know they got their needs met and then I could focus on my studies."
I went wipe my arms/legs/feet whenever I step into the house so I don't bring in dirt from outside
"I use  that same wipe to wipe that few floor tiles I was stepping on with my foot before throwing it away.

As such, I don't bring as much dirt into the house from outside and I have to vacuum/mop less often."
Haha I have those lights under the bed frame
"I didn't think of them as a hack, just something that made sense"
"I guess like most of my ""life hacks"" that ended up discovering were my adaptations :-) 

The most obvious ones are to have a specific place for keys and wallet"
"They can only be in my pocket or in ""their place"", nowhere else"
Specific place for the remote

When I'm doing laundry I put any extra detergent softener, dryer towels whatever that I have not in use and put it next to my toothbrush/toothpaste cup"
So at the end of the night it would remind me if I left something in the washer or dryer that I didn't pick up.
I have pretty severe sound sensitivity issues
"I'll get distracted by any noise and it destroys my workflow.

I went online and I purchased these acoustic blankets"
"I can get you the specific brand I ordered if interested by any acoustic blanket should work.

Basically, I created this buffer outside of my office door"
I work from home and need minimal sound to stay in the flow
"By hanging one of these over the doorway like a curtain, I basically blocked out 90% of the sound coming from the rest of my house.

I did the same for the window as well.

The best part is I used velcro and hooks so I can just take things down whenever I need it gone."
"A locked door at the front means I also locked it in the back

Keyless lock pad on the front door because I can’t handle keys
"Put a timer to everything, 8 minutes to boil an egg, I’ll vaccum in that time"
"Microwave running for two minutes, I’ll take out the laundry in that time"
I race the clock continuously and that is how I get most chores done
"Also, if I do not feel like doing something at the moment but has to be done-I’ll do it on a certain fixed time for eg it is 7:02 and I have to start doing something, I’ll allow myself to start doing it at 7:20"
That way I am also allowing myself some sulking time but also getting work done.
"Automate anything you can to make life easier

If I do it all in one go it doesn’t work, if it’s in two stages then your sleep is already disturbed and it’s harder to ignore the second escalation.

The other one, make more hanging space, turn shelves into drawers"
"I don’t fold tees I hang them, and I replaced all the shelving in my wardrobe with glass front drawers so I can pull them out and get to everything and nothing ends up in the doom of the back of the shelf.

Then the final, write the dosage of all medication on top with sharpie"
"Gotta take my medicine? Or just multivitamins? I know I need 1x1, or 3x2 or whatever the dose is for the day off the lid without having to read the instructions every time."

Can't find a gas lighter for lighting the fire? A block of wood with a custom shaped hole to stand it in, painted pink, and placed strategically on the mantelpiece.

Can't find a pencil or a pencil sharpener?  Three metal rings on the shed door so a pencil can be placed point down, with the lower ring being smaller to the point rests there without falling through"
"The sharpener is placed inside a block of wood on the inside of the door, with a hole in the door aligned with the sharpener"
"A large steel washer surrounding  the hole makes it clear where to insert the pencil.

Various screws and hooks for things like a dustpan and brush, broom, tape measure, spirit level, with the outline of the object drawn on in Sharpie."
"Multiple water cups (usually two in use at a time) so I start my day with two filled up and when I finish one I don't have to go refill it to drink more, because realistically I probably won't bother to do it until hours have passed and now I'm even more dehydrated.

Also smart light bulbs and plugs, and Google home devices"
"I've got my morning alarms setup with a Google assistant routine that turns off my fan, and later turns on the lights when I'm still not getting up.
It also helps with the process of going to bed because having to go turn off the light is something that has kept me from going to bed many nights, but as of the last several years it isn't an issue!

"[OK, that doesn't always happen, but we have a dog sticker on it so when it does end up on the fridge or somewhere else, we know where it belongs!]

Higher than the star on the Christmas tree
In my kitchen I have installed a rod under my cabinet to hang all the kitchen utensils I use in plain eye view.
"My ADHD husband /thinks/ he has a home hack- he uses an antibacterial sanitizer spray as an all purpose cleaner, especially keen on using it on our carpets for some reason"
I have tried to explain countless times that it is a sanitising spray and not a surface/carpet cleaner but he just doesn't get it
"In his mind santizer and cleaner are the same thing. 


It's particularly obvious on the kitchen surfaces- the grease is still there after he 'cleans', you can feel it if you run your hand over it, but the crumbs have been picked up by whatever he's wiped with (usually an anti-bac wipe) so he thinks it's clean"
"He went through a similar phase with using a steam cleaner to clean- I tried it on the kitchen surfaces like he insisted on doing himself but I found much harder work and much slower (practically ineffective) compared to using a regular kitchen cleaner and a cloth. 


Unfortunately it is a well known brand which also makes cleaners so I think he's confused between the purpose of santizer vs cleaner, the marketing is especially confusing as they're essentially advertised the same way. However his rejection sensitivity disphoria is really kicking in and he gets wound up whenever I try to explain the difference.


He thinks it's great for cleaning dog vomit off the carpet (it's not, he's just making it harder for himself)"
The only practical purpose I can see to it is if our family has a virus or bug and you want to sanitize common areas- even then I'd probably just use dilute bleach.

The ADHD subreddit is extremely toxic
"The only opinion you are allowed to have about your own ADHD in that subreddit is that it’s the worst thing that’s ever happened to you, and that medication is a necessary and almost always excellent choice, and that any kind of non-medical coping strategy is just “neurotypical advice” even if it has been empirically demonstrated to be helpful for ADHD"
A lot of “i tried it once and it didn’t work therefore that doesn’t work for ADHD”
"Same vibes as “I exercised once and didn’t lose weight therefore exercise is pointless for me”.

Obviously this is an overgeneralisation, but I find the mods here to be incredibly reactive and intolerant to the slightest suggestion that ADHD can come with strengths as well as weaknesses (even when framed as only my own PERSONAL experience and not a generalisation) or that things like meditation, regular exercise, and using a planner can actually be hugely beneficial if you can successfully form the habit"
Forming habits is fucking hard with ADHD but not impossible
There is a real sense of learned helplessness there which leads to extreme defensiveness against anything that doesn’t align with their worldview.

Number 4 has my mind BLOWN
"I'm gonna bookmark this and never look at it again, while I read the rest of the comments and completely forget this one existed.

Edit: I just realized how much my comment resonates with my user flair.."
🥲
Okay now these are the hacks I can get behind! Also I think the book you’re referring to may be “How to Keep House While Drowning” which I just recommended to someone in another adhd sub this morning.
"I thought of a couple more, so I'll add them here: 

5"
 I stay up too late because I get so tired that I don't want to get ready for bed...so I stopped waiting until bedtime to get ready for bed
"I get ready for bed almost immediately after dinner and just hang out in my pajamas with clean teeth and face, then when I'm tired I can just flop into bed"
"

6..I set alarms for everything"
 NOT reminders/notifications which are easy to ignore
"Annoying, persistent alarms for everything important, such as the time I need to leave the house to walk my kid to the bus stop, the time I need to log on to work, the time I need to leave to pick up my son, etc"
if I have an appointment I set multiple alarms
"

7"
I use the Alarmy app to make it so that I can't dismiss an alarm without thinking about it
It also keys me label alarms so I know what it's reminding me to do
"

8"
"Smart outlet for the toaster because I almost always wonder if I've accidentally left the toaster running when I leave the house (if you turn it off and then a tiny bit past off, it goes to ""stay on"" mode which is really annoying and makes me nervous"
This way I can just shut off the stupid outlet
"

9"
Important things do not leave their places but they also have Tile trackers
My keys are ALWAYS in the back pocket of my purse
My wallet is always in the inner pocket of my purse
The yellow epi-pen holder is always in the big compartment of my purse
The red epi-pen kit that goes wherever my kid goes hangs on a hook ATTACHED TO THE FRONT DOOR so you cannot go out without seeing the bright red case
The second it comes back in the house it goes back on the hook
"

10"
" MY ADHD kid has ""grabby hands"" where he picks things up without thinking and wanders away with them and puts them down without even realizing he was ever holding the object"
"To try and break the habit with the TV remote, we got one of those hotel room style remote tethers to attach it to the coffee table with a coiled cord so you could have it on the couch but not walk away with it"
"It successfully broke the wandering habit, after removing the tether he still leaves it on the coffee table"
"

11"
Certain things always happen together
My kid ALWAYS eats breakfast so he ALWAYS gets his medicine at the same time as his breakfast
I do the timer pill bottle for myself because I don't always eat breakfast
"

12"
Automatic litter box so I don't forget to scoop
It also yells at me when it needs to be emptied
I'm a fan of things that yell at me.
I got this fantastic digital clock thats about the size of a tablet for my kitchen
"It has the time, date, whether it's morning, afternoon or evening and lots of other things"
It's so big you can't miss it
It's meant for elderly and alzheimers patients etc
I can never get focused or settled into what month it let alone date and it's really helped
I actually got it before I even thought I had ADHD and way before my diagnosis.
"To add to this, having the cleaning products you need for that room stored in the room! 

I used to store all my cleaning supplies in the laundry but would get distracted between the room I was cleaning and the laundry so I’d not end up cleaning"
Not having to leave the room makes it a far smoother and fast process
Sure I need multiple bottles of the same cleaning products but it’s way more efficient
Number 3! Not just trash cans! Any small inexpensive thing you might need in multiple rooms should follow N+1
That way you don't need to walk out of the room with it and forget it elsewhere and never find it again
"Some examples of things I find this useful for are scissors and measuring tape (1 for every room+a bunch in the craftroom), deodorant (my room, every bathroom, above the washer, backpack), notepads (every room sans bathrooms) 

Also, get a labeler or a permanent marker and mark which location each one belongs to"
This way when a few inevitably get vortexed together it's easy to know where they came from
That “too long in the shower” part called me out.
"#1 and #2! I have an Alexa in the bathroom, but no clock"
"I ask for the time so much, I'm waiting for the day Alexa responds ""Seriously? Two minutes later than the last time you asked!"""
"I used the pill bottle caps when I was taking care of my dad when he was on hospice and they are fantastic! Of course I managed to lose them one by one after he passed and I tried to use them lol, but for him they were great!"

Big fan of 3 and 4
"I take a med that is extremely dangerous if i double take it, so i have a timer for that one"
"For 3 i have a can in every room, at least."
I’d love a link to the waterproof bathroom clock! I take way too long in the shower
4 is cool… I just use a Webster pack
Fill it up once a week and there’s a pop open box for each day.
"Like other folks, I’m blown away to learn that #4 exist"
"Plus, I’m about to have a pretty big surgery and I have 9 meds to track! I’m getting on Amazon right now to find them!"
"Oh imma incorporate number 2 and 3 in my life immediately! Sounds so obviously great ideas and almost the normal thing to do given my needs now that I read them, but I never thought of these."
I have a note in my phone to write down when I took meds or I would accidentally o.d
myself on anything 🤣
Just found out me having multiple wastebaskets is related to my ADHD!! I had no idea.
On Amazon now adding large display clocks to my cart for college aged son and me! Absolutely brilliant idea! Thanks for this info.
I don’t do pill bottles anymore
I’m now an old lady who has pill organizers! I don’t know how I lived before
For 30 minutes every 3 weeks I fill them in and now I don’t even think about it
"If I look over and it’s not taken, I know I messed up."
"A game changer for me was programming my Alexa to say the time twice every quarter hour, 30 seconds apart.

“It’s 10.15 am … it’s 10.15 am”

Anywhere I am in the house I get verbal time anchors.

At the hour, she says the time but then she chimes like a grandfather clock the hours, so I don’t tune her out as easily.

I also have two ginormous analogue kitchen and open area clocks with day and date, shower clock, digital living room, office and bathroom counter clocks and a smart watch.

Plus my brilliant 120 minute Time Timer, that has a 20cm face and a handle I can carry around the house when I need to stay focused on being ready to leave by a certain time."
"Yep, I also use much bigger bags than most because if the bag gets overfilled, I don't want to touch it"
Those are great tricks esp #4
If you remember the book please post it.
These are awesome
In what science future world do these pill bottles exist?
"Instead of no 4, I just always fill my bottles with an even amount of meds"
As I take one in the morning and one at lunch I now know if I've taken it based on if it's even or not
It doesn't work if I forget completely but thankfully that doesn't happen as much.
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|surprise) Do you have a link for 2?
Can I have the link to the bottle 😂
Are there pillbottles that don’t look like fishfeeders?
"So, bins"
"One of my massive issues is getting up to the bin, there's rubbish everywhere"
I need more bins.
I set up Govee smart buttons on my washer and dryer and connected them to to strips lights that run around the door of the laundry area
"When I start the washer,  I press the button and it sets a timer and the lights glow green so it stays in my mind that I have laundry going"
When the timer is up the lights switch to rainbow colored party lights so I remember to switch
Maybe a little over the top but I have fun playing with smart home stuff and it has been really helpful.
"When my dryer died,  I bought a combo unit"
Does the wash and the dry in the same machine
Takes up half the space and is way more efficient
Takes like 3 hours to do one load but I never have to redo them because I forgot them in the washing machine (repeatedly)
It also texts you when it's done and has a feature to keep the clothes from not getting wrinkled when you don't empty it right away.
"Ahh! I do something similar by placing something unusual in the middle of the floor of the room i’m in, so i will remember to remember something"
"🤭

Like, oh yeah, that peanut butter jar in the doorway was so I remember to feed the cat before I go to the party."
I just recently started a bracelet system I saw elsewhere
"Got a bunch of stretchy wristbands for cheap with tags attached (look up ""key tags"" if you don't know what I mean) and labeled em with things like ""washer"" ""dryer"" ""fold laundry"" ""dishes"" etc"
"They're useful both as reminders to move stuff over/take it out, but also as todo lists to annoy you by jangling around on your wrist until you do them lol"
Working so far!
I wouldn't be able to keep that promise to myself
Kudos
That ball would have been thrown and lost LOL
I just start a timer whenever I start the load
It helps.
I set a timer on Alexa
It’s really helpful.
I have no idea how long my washer takes 😭
Your comment reminded me I need to go move my laundry to the dryer
Thanks!!
Thanks for reminding me to take my clothes out of the dryer
Just remembered I put it in yesterday
Dammit.
How much laundry do you have that you need to do two a day??? Do you own a bed and breakfast?

This made me lolll"
It's sadly not even that much of an exaggeration.
I use a time lock box to imprison my phone and TV remote
It’s been fantastic for my sleep

I love these ideas! My screen time is still way too high but I found removing all my apps from my home screen (I have an iPhone) and using widgets help
"I only have my clock, calendar, weather and notes widgets on my first page, second page of my home screen is only a big widget displaying screen time so at least I’m reminding myself of my screen time before I do swipe over the App Library"
"

I also have time limits set on my phone, focus modes set up and put a shortcut to switch to black and white mode by tapping the home button three times (which is handy when you want to take photos)"

"

Same with phone screen addiction - when I didn't have data, unplugging the wifi router helps"
"When I did have data, I put the phone in power saving mode (texts, calls, alarms nothing else) after a certain time of night"
"I reward myself with a treat! I set alarms to start this, but after a while its.."
"easier to relax into and I look forward to it.

I also I'd say this might be adjusted with a multiple person household (lol)"
"I think the biggest thing is, I feel SO MUCH BETTER when I have downtime doing something with my hands and no tv/screens, so it feels easier to keep going after the first week."
for 3 - I've started using a pretty basket my mom gave me to collect my items
"now I feel so fancy with a little basket I bring to my car, it's easy to carry everything in one arm, and I don't have to worry about getting everything put away in my bag before I leave the house."
"Some of these are just general (not adhd specific) life hacks but:

Alexa turns the bedroom light on at the same time that my alarm goes off, I’m terrible at getting up"
"Really just automate anything I can, turning lights off at a certain time that I know I will be asleep or not home every day, automatic dog feeder, etc"
"

Separate area in my closet for work clothes to make getting ready easier in the morning when my meds haven’t kicked in yet and I’m blurry eyed trying to convince myself not to quit my job and go back to bed lol

Dump basket at the bottom of the stairs to dump stuff that belongs upstairs in and I take it up once a week and unload it"
Keeps the stair doom pile contained
"

Multiple laundry baskets since one is always sitting in the laundry room either waiting to be washed or waiting to be loaded with clean clothes to take back upstairs"
So I trade off one in the bedroom one in the laundry room and I have one spare.
I have a dry erase board on my fridge and I like to write down all the really perishable produce when I get my groceries so I am always aware of what needs to be eaten first
"

Or I write down the meals I had planned so I make sure to use up the odd ingredients I specifically bought for that meal"
Otherwise weeks go by before I realize there's a moldy box of mushrooms because I forgot I wanted to make stroganoff once upon a time.
Out of sight out of mind
I keep my vacuum out in the open so it’s easy to quickly vacuum
If it was put away in the closet I’d never vacuum
This is fucking godly
You just changed my life
clear produce drawers help
"Or, there are clear produce storage boxes available if you want to get the benefits of a produce drawer."
This is SO SMART!
So smart!
"Yessss I did this too and it changed my life! 
The drawers are now condiment hotels, not vegetable hospices!!!"
I will write on bottles and jars the day I opened it
"We had to do this at a job I worked at so it just makes sense.
If I meal prep I will write on the calendar when I made that food.
If I'm freezing food I made I always write the date it was made on tape and stick it on the container.
This has helped with a lot of food waste issues because I never knew how old something was."
I do a lot of these
I also have boxes for my kids’ stuff and  my wife’s stuff in the living room so I don’t have to leave the room to put stuff away
"

My wife never understands why I asked her to only to buy the same socks"
 And I don’t understand she doesn’t understand that sorting through a basket of unmatched socks is hell on earth
"

I also have lanyards for my keys and work badge"
They live on my neck or a specific hook
I haven’t lost my keys in months
"My wallet, however is … somewhere"
I think i need to add it to one of my lanyards
"

Apple Watch keeps me from losing my phone.

I carry and use a physical notebook everywhere"
"I’ve accepted that my memory is shot, and I need to externalize everything possible"
I don’t go to the store without a physical list anymore.
Omg I hate hangers with a passion
I have learned all of this after the last several years
It takes so much to learn these things
Thanks for taking the time to write this out for the rest of the world
💗 it would have helped younger me out a ton!
>Get only black socks so you don't have to worry about matching pairs
"

Always buy the same socks"
"Problem is, as you wash them they lose colour"
I have to spread out all my socks on my bed and match them by shade for how many times they've been washed.
"I tried the red light before bed, and sunrise setting for my wakeup alarm"
"

The red light fades down to 1 percent then turns off, but if I forget something and need to turn the light on it goes right back to 100 percent white light."
"I was like, wtf is a pressure senõr?

🇲🇽"
Please tell us more! What else is linked to your home assistant?
Wait wait
Can the pressure sensors tell what phase of sleep I’m in??
I resemble this remark! Just this week I got a five pack of smart plugs and spent ages setting them up to turn various things on and off automatically
My favourite is that my coffee nook light now comes on automatically when the kitchen lights come on and go off when the kitchen lights go off
"For some reason the fitters installed this little LED thing that could only be controlled with a remote and I would always leave the kitchen but forget to turn it off and then have to get back up to turn it off, or sometimes even wake up the next day to find it was still on"
"Now I don't have to use the remote and I don't have to think about turning it on and off.

I also have automations to turn my office lights on and off when I walk in or leave the room"
Next I want to automate my blinds so that actually get some sunlight instead of sitting in the dark all day like some kind of goblin.
Do NOT sit down until it is safe to potato needs to be my motto.
How do you reconcile “have dog” with “don’t go home if you have plans” ?
Ooh I like all of yours!
I removed the closet doors and replaced them with semi/sheer curtains
It’s just enough to cut the visual clutter without putting the contents of the closet out of mind.
I am using your garbage bag tip
My bathroom bin is always overflowing and annoying me for weeks until I finally take it out
(I typed out this comment and then went and got four garbage bags and folded them and put them into the bathroom bin and then came back and posted my comment
I also took my vitamins and put some mail away along the way.) Thank you for posting!
My wife is my biggest ADHD hack
VIP status.
You're lucky! Make sure to tell her and show her some nice appreciation often
Great minds (have terrible spatial awareness) 😄
"This person here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/s/YCDxYH8xBj

Put little trays out"
Especially for collections of stuff that's small
Then you can just grab the whole tray when you need to clean
"Also, in a similar vein, you can get drawer trays, some come in sets with multiple sizes that all kinda fit together in different configurations -- could help especially for that junk drawer we all have"
Obv IKEA / Amazon has stuff like this
"I'd prefer bamboo or something rather than plastic, tho -- more long-lasting, but also trying to cut down on unnecessary plastic in general."
The only cure is more horizontal surfaces! This is why I got rid of my desk.
"Nice one! I'm currently doing house cleaning as my own business, & I can get really stuck into certain tasks, being a perfectionist *and* time-blind, so I have my phone go off every 20 minutes with like a million snoozes to last however many hours I'm on the job"
"I wear a watch when I work, too, but the phone is better cos it tells me the time when I even forget to check the time 😜"
What app do you use?
I've started doing that too
Came up with the idea myself when I bought a new joint and decided out with the old and in with the new
 It works well - though my dishwasher remains my crockery and cutlery cupboard
But I still forget or put it off sometimes.
Where do you put the boxes after? On a shelf or just stacked on top of each other?
I desperately wanted the attention span to read all that
I made it to the second paragraph.
Which vacuum is that? Sounds amazing!
"Or, announce it out loud to yourself… somehow helps us remember the action"
“the stove is off at 10:14 am” or “my work badge is in the front pocket of my backpack”…
I really love this
lol
This
I have mostly everything in wardrobes and cupboards etc without doors or with glass doors. 
"This is a great idea, even for line hanging -- less wrinkles, plus just one move instead of pegging on the line, removing from the line, remembering to put them away, hanging on hangers, etc"
Nice one!
I got over trying to exactly pair socks when wearing long socks some time ago
"After years of frustration, near enough is close enough nowadays."
"There 100% is here in my house.

That’s brilliant."
Air tag for the car is a great one!
I figured out I can wear an earbud in the shower
I only shower now with a podcast playing
"

I love your other hacks!"
"Awww, same with me & my boyfriend"
"He knows where stuff is, what day it is, when my appointments are, other stuff we gotta do, etc etc"
"I literally set reminders with him before bed for stuff I've gotta do tomorrow, like people do with Alexa or whatever"
"""Hey, boyfriend, remind me tomorrow I've gotta do XYZ."" Or, ""Hey, boyfriend, remind me in an hour to get the clothes out of the washer."" etc etc"
"I tried writing stuff down, but then I have a thousand sticky notes & ignore all of them"
"Same with many alarms -- but I've managed to put like 5 snoozes on my meds reminder, & I'm pretty good with that now.

Looking for everything in the morning / whenever we go out, tho.."
that needs work
"I've started keeping doubles, like in the car"
"I'm not really a handbag girl, so I can't keep doubles in one particular bag -- but that would definitely help, or even having a tote bag on a hook near the front door or something"
"You know, stuff like spare glasses, hair brush, deodorant, one pair of socks, stuff like that, which I routinely lose.

But seriously, a supportive non-ADHD partner is great! That said, someone in the same boat can really empathise, even tho you are both a little chaotic, which is nice too."
"me too! my at home hack is my husband, he always reminds me what I have to do and where I put my stuff."
What’s a house purse?
It's on hold at the library so thanks for the reminder!
Here too!
Definitely need to do this with my phone
"

“Ok, it was in my hand a minute ago…” Sometimes when I search for it I think “The universe is obviously playing a trick on me and has rendered it invisible.”"
I leave the vent hood light on so I don't forget
I love the idea of adding a basket for clothes you’ve worn but don’t consider dirty.
Goblin Tools is a personal favourite of mine
What do the lights under the bedframe do? Why is it an ADHD hack?

I use those pill bottles too
"Turns out my allergies are much better when I take medication everyday day, and don't skip days I don't remember if I took anything or not."
"I bought some from Amazon, but the batteries only lasted a year"
"I managed to get them changed but my god those were the tiniest screws I've ever seen, far smaller than in a phone even."
My mind is still in the process of being blown by what I just read

"Can't get those in Europa, so I ordered them from the US and they were definitely my best purchase of 2023"
Made my life so much easier
"Also, the description says you can't change the battery, but with a small screwdriver it's absolutely no problem to do so anyway"

For a cheaper solution (that also works!) I just got one of those pill organizers from a drugstore that lists the days of the week on top of each compartment
I always take my pills in the morning when I first get up and go to the bathroom
Bonus from the pill organizer: now I can double-check what day it is!
They are life changing.

"I lost count of how many things i’ve screenshotted cause I figure itll be useful later, only to realize 80% of my storage is now filled with it.."
Laughing at this as I had just saved the post when I got to your comment :)
"Yes, exactly what I did"
😅
LMAO
KC Davis is amazing
She has helped me tremendously.
"I have this book but have never read it, much like the hundreds of other books I've bought."
"This is a great book to listen to on Spotify.

Especially the chapter about cleaning your car."
Opening a new tab so I won't forget to buy that book!
I always went to be between 1-2 in the morning
"Nowadays, it's 22:30 at it's latest"
Sometimes I miss those late nights
"However, I just made it into a routine (partly because of having kids but also needing the 8 hours) to go to bed around 22:00 - 22:30 and get up at 07:00"
"In the weekends a bit later.

  
I think the biggest ADHD hack of them all is to mzake everything a routine"
"After that, it becomes really hard to get away from it"
"

  
This works also the other way around"
If I decide to eat some candy from our kids at 22:00..
"before I know it my brain says: ""22:00 is candy eating time"""
Litter-Robot has been a game changer for me
And for my cats
They're happier now.
I need 12
What brand do you use? 
"For litter we went with the low-tech brute force option - we put 3 large storage bins in the basement so that if we forget for even a week there's still plenty of capacity for the cats to bury things and it's not a big deal.

Takes a little over 100 lbs of litter to fill everything up."
Would you mind to share the link to that clock? Thank you!
That's exactly what I have on my desk! I love it so much
(saw your Amazon link below and it's the exact one I have)
I hung an old tablet on a cabinet door with some 3M strips
"I keep the clock app running all the time, but can also pull up recipes or listen to YouTube or stream music."
We did this as well
" Don't limit yourself to just things like bottled cleaners.

We put perfect tear paper towel holders and grocery bag holders in each bathroom and it's been great.

Have been considering adding in rubber glove dispensers as well.

For those looking for where to put stuff, over the door racks work well (we picked a bunch up when Menards had them on sale for $1)"
I have a million scissors and pens 😆!
This is brilliant!
I just got out of the shower about 10 mins ago
"The entire time I was in there, I was thinking about the 4 empty shampoo and conditioner bottles I have in there and how I really need to throw them out"
Spoiler alert: I forgot to throw the out.
"Visual timer helps me, my mind starts going and then I don't realize how long I've been in the shower"
"Watching the timer helps keep me focused on what I need to do before it goes off.


I initially bought it for my students to use in class but then realize, hey I need this too lol 


https://a.co/d/4NvTFRs "
2 minutes later?  I'll ask Alexa the time right after I asked her the time because I asked her and then forgot to pay attention when she told me lol.
I put an Alexa that has the light up clock in the bathroom just because of this!
Guilty of the same thing
I will ask a question and just literally forget to listen for the answer
😂😂
"Bathroom Alexa is also great for when you remember things for later! I'm constantly telling her to remind me of things in like 30 minutes when I know I'll be out of the shower, lol."
Alexa sounds like my wife 😂 except she adds “you’re wearing a watch”
"Yeah, I take both Wellbutrin and Adderall and both at high doses, so taking extra presents a high seizure risk"
I'd always erred on the side of not taking it if there was a chance I might have already
The timer pull bottles have given me such peace of mind there.
"This is the one I have, but there are loads of options if you search for ""shower clock"":

https://a.co/d/fxXN68g"
I have Spotify playing on my phone within range which also keeps track of my blood glucose  and use the song lengths as my timer 
I'm usually out in decent time but sometimes I need to just breathe and listen
" 
  I keep certain meds out and then most in a hero dispenser (I have a referral code if interested) , which is not the cheapest option but my cats know to wake me or check on me if it goes off and I haven't taken them "
I keep them in a different room to make myself get up 
I keep my as needed/more potent meds separate and pair them with my multivitamin or another daily thing 
"
  I keep a toothbrush and toothpaste in the shower or move in and out so I can brush my teeth while my hair mask sits ."
"Good luck with your surgery! 

This is the particular pill bottle I bought, though there are others:

"It was in How to Keep House While Drowning, but I think it was also in Order From Chaos by Jaclyn Paul, which had a lot more straightforward ""getting organized with ADHD"" advice, whereas the first one has some great practical advice but to me was more about changing your mindset about home and self care tasks and being gentler with yourself
 

Both excellent books"
"I didn't actually finish the Order From Chaos one, but I read an awful lot of it."

Laundry disco!!! I love the lights idea! I just tell Google Nest to set a laundry timer.
This would be brilliant to remind my hubby to do the dishwasher before bed.
This is soooo cool! I have alarms set for everything and leave the laundry room light on.
Omg I love this idea! I want rainbow party light reminders
I’m so sad I didn’t get one when my washer kicked it
"My mom and aunt were horrified saying they break down blah blah 

I might still get one but I spent so much on my current set ugh 😭"
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes) Drop the model name!
This sounds really helpful
Do you have the make and model of this machine?
What did you get
"We have a wash/dryer but it is old and barely dries, so I am thinking of replacing it."
"I always remember that episode from two and a half men, when the housekeeper resigns"
The owner of the house has to do the laundry and his brother teaches him how to do it
He then jokes that the washing machine will text him when it's done
"Cue the laughter.

Now that's a reality."
I have a red rubber clown nose in my car (why and where did it come from? no idea whatsoever but it's definitely an attention-grabber)
I leave it in the middle of the driver's seat when I get out if there's something urgent to do on my next time out (buy gas because the gas light came on just before I got home or we're on the last roll of toilet paper).
Same but google nest/home
Same!
It probably takes around an hour
If you set a timer for 1.5 hours it will almost certainly be done unless it’s a super heavy duty load.
Nah I’ve just been severely depressed for the last five years and I’m still catching up.
"I’m a normal household and have four busy adult sized people, plus pets"
"Four beds bedding, towels, etc… One load a day at minimum, two isn’t out of the question"
You don’t have to be depressed or behind to have a lot of laundry.
I do a similar thing
I recently got a new phone
The old one I've stripped of every app except the alarm and Google voice and use it as an alarm clock and put the turned off new phone on a charger across the room
I've been using the voice number as a backup for years and everyone who might need to contact me knows it so can call it in an emergency
"But I can't doomscroll without either fetching and turning on my phone or going thru a few hoops to first reinstall the play store on the alarm phone and then installing whatever app I wanted and then login, both are enough of a barrier to stop me once I've put the phone away for the night"
“Frustratingly well” LOLZ 😂 I feel that in my soul!
"\*It also gets harder to enforce screens off in depressive times or seasons, so I adjust"
"If it's hard, sometimes tv is comforting even if I'm watching it hours a day"
"There's a reason, sometimes, and it serves a need"
"So, YMMV"
If I'd tried to do this 6 years ago I'd have hated it so much.
My soul dog intuitively learned to get me up in the morning
"No joke, she would pull my covers off if my alarm went off more than once"
Or maybe she was just annoyed by the noise lol
🤔🤷🏻‍♀️
">Separate area in my closet for work clothes

Largely the same idea, but using the currently available space to create a separate area: We hang all of our clothes and drawer space is reserved for undergarments"
I bought a multicolor pack of hanging clothes separators
Think back to old K-Mart clothing racks with the size rings keeping everything organized
"I have a label maker, so my husband and I sat down and made category labels that made sense to us"
"Then I stuck them on the rings, and we organized the closet"
"It's so easy to flip to the section labeled ""work pants"" or ""work shirts"" and the way we shop everything is eyes-closed-mix-n-match from there."
"> Separate area in my closet for work clothes to make getting ready easier in the morning when my meds haven’t kicked in yet and I’m blurry eyed trying to convince myself not to quit my job and go back to bed lol

My work shirts and pants literally hang on hooks on the wall so I can just grab 'em lol"
I got specific shirts that are basically wrinkle-proof so I don't really need to hang em on hangers.
Great ideas
"Ughhh.

I want to redo my central vac"
"

Currently, 1 outlet on both floors, and a long hose that can reach the whole level"

"The only issue is that when you're with people with iphones they 100% will get a notification that someone is tracking them, but its worth the explanation for me to not be having weekly panics about losing my wallet"

One of my favorite recent additions: I discovered that all the traffic cameras in my state are accessible online
"It turns out, a few of them are on the roads I take to work.

Now, I’ve got those cameras added to my home assistant dashboard, and I can check live road conditions before I leave in the morning"

I have a significant other who works from home so she gets plenty of attention
"If we go out together, I stay in the car and boyfriend comes out (sometimes bringing dog, when appropriate)."
"I'm glad it helped! Going under the sink to find a garbage bag is so annoying to me and it's enough friction to make me not want to do it, so I figure if I do it once instead of every time, it's saved me time."
You're lucky! Make sure to tell her and show her some nice appreciation
Hahaha I'll have to tell her I'm a VIP in the ADHD reddit community because she is a living Life Hack 😂

Yeah exactly!
"I got a shower Bluetooth speaker, it works really well!"
"Just a purse you keep “your stuff in”:

- tablet
- vaseline
- chapstick
- daily medicine
- charger

I feel like a crazy person
Like “I JUST had it and actively tried to remember where I put it…then like somehow blacked out that whole transaction…”
Not a bad idea if I remember to go back in the kitchen lmfao
I didn't consider it a hack
"For me it is just part of getting to bed without waking up my partner as she usually goes earlier, as she goes to work hours earlier than meq"
For OP sounds like it is because the impulse to jump out of bed for something forgotten makes them injure their foot/toes/shin in the dark.
Oh.and what they do is that they turn on with motion
They stay on for 20-30 seconds after motion stops.

Be careful
There is increasing amounts of research showing a relationship to a history of regular use of antihistamines and a subsequent Alzheimer's diagnosis.

"It comes in a two pack, I use it everyday twice a day…treat yourself!"
I just replaced two! Needed tweezers..
Have two more that need replaced but haven't gotten to - they are each with a different group of meds for me or my kid
Still so worth it
"No more did I actually do that and with stimulants, more importantly, when did I do that"
My other less time sensitive meds are in a regular pill box
Do meds typically come with those kinds of lids? I've never checked mine for that
"I turn my pill bottle upside down on the counter when I notice it needs refilling, so maybe the 5th or 6th time I see it, I'll remember to go to my computer & request the refill."
"So whenever I find something that works, I use gmail to send myself a scheduled email in, say, six weeks time to remind me about it."

 Places to visit and travel with my wife
Group finances with my wife and several others
Also groups with my kids for example projects
I have a few groups with myself ...i have 2 phones
One of them is health all my screenshots about health related stuff or reddit links or yourube links or screenshots i put in there
 That way i categorize everything
" Health, recipes, projects...tgen i can use the search function in the whatsapp group to find limks or screenshots."
I plan to go through all of my screenshots and hundreds of open tabs on my phone Internet browser to see all the forgotten things and write them down
Wish me luck
omg me too

"For sure! I just read the book on Thursday, and I cried three times just getting through the intro"
It felt like she wrote the book for me and I just felt so relieved reading it (tbf I cry a LOT lol)
I’ve recommended it to several people already and have already noticed a major difference mentally when I’m confronting messes
And my laundry is actually getting put away now that I’ve given myself permission to be flexible with my system
"It’s only been a week but it just felt like a much needed perspective shift that I can implement over time, rather than a destined-to-fail guide for the “right” way of doing things."
"It’s worth it! I think read the entire thing in 2 hours 15 minutes, but the author specifically inserts shortcuts for skipping chapters, highlights the most important takeaways in bold, and uses an easy-to-read font."
I think that was my favorite part 😂 I sent a picture of that page to quite a few people

I always just throw em right out of the shower
"Right now they go straight into the sink since it's right next to the shower, at the house before that they just went on the rug outside the shower (much harder to forget about either way even if I get distracted immediately post shower, because they're right in eyesight any time I go into the bathroom after that)."
"I unfortunately still live with my parents, but my mom and I trim each other’s hair because salons around here kinda suck"
" I asked her to trim mine tonight and she said I could take a shower instead of just washing it over the tub and showering after, but I wanted to style it (aka scrunch some mousse into it) after she trimmed it and I also knew she wouldn’t want to wait for me to get done in the shower.

It was easier for me to just have her trim it first and then let her be free while I shower after"
" I also just remembered I need to put shower curtain liners on the list for the store, but I’ll probably forget again by the time I finish in the shower"
" Whoopssss.

Fortunately I don’t have any empty bottles in mine…"
At the moment
 👀
I put the empty ones in the bathroom sink so the next time I need to wash my hands I see them and put them in the thrash before I wash my hands.
"My friend actually got me one, so I do have one"
 But then the timer runs out and I’m still not done
 😐
"Lol, same meds!"
It’s the worst when you really can’t remember and have to resort to counting them out

I never connected those timers to being used by me for adhd, bc they always show an elderly person in the pictures"
"This is a nice “duh!” moment, thank you! 💯"
"You can take both Wellbutrin and Adderall?? Everything I read said no so I never brought it up with my doctor.

Wellbutrin has helped a lot for consistency but there are definitely days I could use the extra help of Adderall.
Thank you!

Same here but we have like 3-4 loads every other week
Unless you wash your towels after one use I don't see how this happens.
"My soul dog just keeps snoring 😴 that girl will not give up sleep and cuddles for anything!!! It makes getting out of bed 1000x harder, but I know if I was her, I’d do the same 😂😂🥱🥱🛌🛌"

He comes back when I am asleep
"
  He also knows to alert me to laundry as my units make a chime when complete"
He alerts to packages delivered and when someone is at the door

"Like, most people use it to tell everyone where the cops are 😜"

Yeah i used to use a great phone app but it’s switched from using the accelerometer to using the microphone and that’s a problem for me because I use a CPAP and it just confuses it.

"Like when it comes to updating the software and you don’t have the 12GB required to even download it so have to waste hours deleting 10GB worth of random stuff, which still isn’t enough to download the update and so you delete more stuff and repeat the cycle forever."

Nope
Never ever
I buy storage instead.

Meditation isn’t about suppressing your thoughts directly through willpower
The important thing is that you make an effort to stay aware metacognitively
Noticing that you’re distracted or that your thoughts are racing is enough
Over time things will slow down naturally if you manage to sustain this metacognitive perspective
"

But yes, I agree that listening actively to something helps a lot"
Imagine trying to hear a very faint sound and your thoughts usually quiet immediately
Meditation could be described as ”listening” not just to sound but to all senses.
Look into Pink noise
It has been noted to improve focus in ADHD
Same
"I could finally meditate with some beads, but even that was hard"
"
And like you said, some music helped way better"
"Whether it be relaxing, mindful, chants music or some specific destress, anxiety and adhd free music"
They seems to be working better for me as well
"Two things I'd like to share here:


https://youtu.be/20ReDOxIoEs?t=143&si=MS8ByOBch40zGqLR


https://youtube.com/shorts/AP_3nc8seEI?si=WXYqfbRXf9KEDwAn


Meditation is not about ""blanking"" your thoughts or ""emptying"" your mind"
"When you get past that, it becomes easier because you don't feel like you're failing by doing something that isn't expected of you anyway."
I’m happy you found some success in meditation :) it’s less about “clearing your mind” and more so about acknowledging thoughts without feeding them and then refocusing on the breath
"I’ve found in time my mind does become more clear, but with adhd it operates in different speeds sometimes, so it’s still hard"
I’m huge into meditation and yoga and they have been huge help in my life
"It’s not a cure all by any means, but a powerful tool in our arsenal of tricks.

Best of luck to you! Have a good one"
"The sound of silence is a good internal source of this! Basically try to focus on the ringing in your ears, it's  nature's white noise"
"When you get distracted just try again! Alternatively there's the ""Buddha's discourse on distracting thoughts"" one of the oldest Buddhist texts, where the Buddha's last resort is basically to smash your tongue to the roof of your mouth as hard as you can, because thoughts really do be annoying sometimes.

Meditation is a brain muscle workout"
"The point isn't usually to stop the thoughts, just to keep redirecting to your ""practice/area of focus"" and make it happen faster/easier over time! With enough practice monks can evoke a state of mind at will.

Make it a game with breath counting, can you get to 5 without losing count/ a distracting thought? How high can you go? Can you follow and pinpoint how the breath travels? Where does it go? Woops distracted, restart"
"Do a body scan, is your scalp relaxed? Eyelids? jaw? Lips? Can you hold all those all at once? Woops my temples are tense restart! Visualize your breath like a flame in your belly how far can you stretch it with each breath? Can you make it reach your elbows?

Source: special interest +friend of meditation teacher."
"Another way to think about meditation involves acknowledging the thoughts as they arise, and let them pass"
" You and I are probably similar in that the thought stream rarely stops flowing.

I am not saying “you are doing it wrong.”  It’s more about being exactly who you are, right now, thoughts streaming."
"Another potential option for anyone else struggling to meditate: I found the cadence of guided meditation in Headspace to work well.

It felt like every time I was starting to struggle, the guide would pop back in and redirect me back to the meditation."
"I love meditation, but I'm just gonna put this here though and hope that it saves someone"
"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/03/31/1241784635/meditation-vipassana-dangerous-mental-health

Extreme meditation and sensory deprivation can lead to depression or extreme sensitivity to stimuli"
"Things ADHD-people are extremely vulnerable to.

Just a heads up"
Meditation isn't all upsides
I recommend the NPR podcast on the subject.
I just call meditation “controlled zoning out”  when I use that approach it’s a lot easier to tap into
"For me those spikemats work wonders, because I can focus on how that makes me feel."
"Meditation isn't ""blanking"" your thoughts, it's being present with them"
This and practicing Om ‘ing (idk how to spell it properly) during meditation has helped me
"It gives you sounds but if you focus on big deep breathes and long Om’s, you get more into your body and out of your head"
And the vibrating in your torso has a calming effect and I always feel much better.
Binaural beats work as well!
"Problem is.
Focusing on sound alone never works for me personally.
Music, sound in general is always an accomplice to some other activity.

That’s just me though."
"Walking meditation works well.

Walk while counting your steps in sidewalk squares"
"

Find an outdoor labyrinth and walk it into the center and back out"
It's just lines on the ground and there is no way to get lost
Focus on each step
Silently say lifting as you lift yoir foot
Then moving
And finally planting
Then the other foot
 Very very slowly
"

Find a zen meditation group"
You don't have to be Buddhist
 Do a four day retreat
It is all silence and you spend your day in between sitting in front of a wall or doing walking meditation going in circles around the room
"After a couple days, your mind will be screaming at you"
 Ut as a beginner you will probably be tasked with counting your  breaths up to four and then back to one
Over and over
You will feel like falling asleep and in that dreamy state start having vivid hallucinations temporarily
They go away after you take the breaks in sitting to walk
"If you are fortunate, you may find that your monkey mind stops chattering"
"Just you, sitting quietly and counting"
The peace I felt was overwhelming and I found that after the retreat I could tap into it occasionally
I did this practice for a couple years and the biggest change was that I lost my propensity to raging anger at stupid people
It just went away.
"Bilateral music is helpful, also meditation with eyes open fixated on a point in the visual field"
Kind of like Brainspotting.
"Not sure if this would work for meditation, but I find the birdsong on the YouTube channel Birder King helps me focus when working from home"
"I started using it during lockdown (when I started wfh) to keep my cat entertained while I worked, and kinda Pavloved myself into needing it."
"An alternative to meditation - like the most light alternative - is doing the 4-7-8 breathing exercise.
I recommend the use of the free app Breathe (blue icon).

As a figure of speech, this doesn't reset your mental operating system but it does close down programs and boot them up again"
"It makes some free space available again to continue your day.

I simply can't meditate and I decided to just accept the facts"
"4-7-8 on the other hand is what offers advantages similar to meditation, maybe just on a slightly lower level."
I find [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hLvU7ppM4vE) to be most effective technique to meditate
"No need for any external stimulus, can do this anywhere at any time even when waiting in line."
Closest I’ve ever come to anything like meditation is running for at least an hour with no music or audiobook or podcast
Just me and the run.
Did you try walking meditation?
"You can also meditate with your eyes open, this may also provide enough stimulation to perform your meditation"
It doesn't always have to be done with your eyes closed.
I fall always asleep
That is a very nice approach.
I just found this too!!!!
"[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DZ06evO3zEPYs](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DZ06evO3zEPYs)

i recomend this playlist"
I love watching guided meditations
"I’m not sure if it’s the same type of meditation you are describing OP, but I can easily tell when my mind is wandering and become very aware of the way my thoughts move."
The ADHD subreddit is extremely toxic
"The only opinion you are allowed to have about your own ADHD in that subreddit is that it’s the worst thing that’s ever happened to you, and that medication is a necessary and almost always excellent choice, and that any kind of non-medical coping strategy is just “neurotypical advice” even if it has been empirically demonstrated to be helpful for ADHD"
A lot of “i tried it once and it didn’t work therefore that doesn’t work for ADHD”
"Same vibes as “I exercised once and didn’t lose weight therefore exercise is pointless for me”.

Obviously this is an overgeneralisation, but I find the folks there to be incredibly reactive and intolerant to the slightest suggestion that ADHD can come with strengths as well as weaknesses (even when framed as only my own PERSONAL experience and not a generalisation) or that things like meditation, regular exercise, and using a planner can actually be hugely beneficial if you can successfully form the habit"
Forming habits is fucking hard with ADHD but not impossible
There is a real sense of learned helplessness there which leads to extreme defensiveness against anything that doesn’t align with their worldview.
This is exactly it
"Meditation isn’t not being distracted, it’s the process of noticing you’re distracted and refocusing on the present moment."
"Yes! In the same way that true confidence is more about being aware of and in control of insecurity rather than not having any, meditation is about changing your relationship to your thoughts rather than eliminating them entirely."
"If you're seated on the ground, turning on a tiny fan blowing at your legs has been super helpful to me"
It gives that little restless part of my mind something to focus on.
">focus on the ringing in your ears, it's nature's white noise

NAD, but maybe you should get checked for tinnitus?"
Vipanassa is just one way of meditation.
"While I appreciate and I agree with the caution, your sources state that it's only as dangerous as trying most other types of therapy.

 ""8 percent of participants had a negative effect from practicing meditation, which is similar to the percentage reported for psychological therapies"""
"""Buddho""= one who knows/the observer is also a good one!  Mantras are great for grounding whatever they are, I too find that if I'm chanting I have less brain space to wander with."
Find sound with no focus point
"I stay too grounded with music, but white noise helps distract your brain’s active listening mechanisms."
"""as much as 98% of the population will experience tinnitus in a room that is quiet enough""

Source: https://neuaudio.com.au/title-2/"
"Yes, and the dangers of meditation very likely apply to all forms of meditation"
Not just the one
This has only been studied recently.
I can't find what you are referencing
"But it sounds like a single study?

The major study looking at the last 40 years is pretty clear"
Anyway we clearly haven't done enough to see the full picture
I'm just advicing caution.
Dangers of *extreme meditation.
"There's a meditation where you visualize your body slowly decomposing, and then there's breath counting"
I agree with your warning but I think it's equally as dangerous overstating danger and making that broad of a generalization.
"Tldr:"" investigators found that the mindfulness practices were not more harmful than receiving no treatment.""

""6,703 participants) and found that 55 of those studies reported negative experiences related to meditation practices"
"The researchers concluded that about 8 percent of participants had a negative effect from practicing meditation, which is similar to the percentage reported for psychological therapies"
The most commonly reported negative effects were anxiety and depression
"In an analysis limited to 3 studies (521 participants) of mindfulness-based stress reduction programs, investigators found that the mindfulness practices were not more harmful than receiving no treatment.""

From the source you listed: https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/meditation-and-mindfulness-effectiveness-and-safety"
"Nope.

https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/meditation-and-mindfulness-effectiveness-and-safety

Here's some more info on article form

https://theconversation.com/meditation-can-be-harmful-and-can-even-make-mental-health-problems-worse-230435"
I'm not sure why you think I am overstating the danger or generalizing
It applies to all forms of meditation
For example using apps to tell you to breathe or going on retreats with no-contact
"I mean, sure if you say your meditating while listening to your favorite hiphop and doing a dance I wouldn't argue, but that generally isn't what we consider meditation."
"I'm saying its overstating because the studies themselves say it's hard to get data because meditation practices are so varied, so it doesn't apply to all forms of meditation"
"They also said 8% negative experiences is about how much doing any sort of therapy amasses.

Tldr: headlines like to headline, if you're being more mindful of how anxious you are....you're going to notice you're more anxious...but dangerous is a strong word."

What do I even do? Can I even get a career?

I started a new job a year ago, and while I was happy to be progressing in my career and blah blah blah, I couldn't stop making mistakes, forgetting stuff, not being able to follow instructions.."

I don't know what hacks could help in your line of work"

"definitely see a doctor! don’t feel as though your symptoms aren’t valid! just because you weren’t diagnosed at a young age, doesn’t mean you can’t have adhd"
"for starters, adhd is genetic and as your son has it, he could’ve inherited it from you"
majority of females with adhd are diagnosed in their later life while males are usually diagnosed as children
"boys are three times more likely to be diagnosed, and around 50-75% of women with ADHD go undiagnosed"
"this is because symptoms present differently, especially in childhood"
"females often have an inattentive type of adhd and display less characteristic symptoms such as forgetfulness, daydreaming, disorganisation, and many more"
"males often display symptoms like hyperactivity, inability to sit still, and intense emotions and outbreaks"
"most people, even nowadays think adhd is just about being hyperactive"
this is why symptoms in girls often go unnoticed as they arent “disruptive enough” to be adhd
the symptoms are often passed off as anxiety or hormones
so it is totally possible that you went through this as a child/teenager! don’t be scared to go to a doctor
i can assure you that you will have immense support
"if you get a diagnosis and have adhd, you’ll finally have an understanding of your symptoms, and medication will be extremely beneficial to you! from what you’ve said, adhd is definitely a possibly so don’t be scared! good luck!!"

"Emotional ups and downs can definitely be linked to ADHD, as it often affects emotional regulation"
"Many people with ADHD experience intense feelings that can shift quickly, sometimes called “emotional lability.” This is normal for ADHD but can feel overwhelming.

What you’re describing—knowing that your feelings will eventually even out but feeling unsure in the moment—is common"
"It doesn’t mean your reality isn’t valid; both the highs and lows are reflections of how emotions influence your thoughts at the time.

If it’s causing significant distress or making it hard to navigate relationships, it might help to explore strategies for emotional regulation, like mindfulness, therapy, or even ADHD-specific coaching"
"You could also talk to your doctor about this, as some ADHD treatments can help with emotional regulation"
"You’re not alone, and there are ways to make the emotional swings more manageable!"
ADHD indirectly leads to many unhealthy thought patterns as it impairs skills that would lead to healthy development
"ADHD increases risk of many other disorders and issues, however, this specific example / pattern isn't a feature of the disorder itself"
" 


It's normal to react to fights or upsetting moments with reflection, but it isn't normal to be so lost on 'what reality is.'  and take minor disruptions as cues that it's all a mistake"
"There's too much missing information to make any kind of comments on why you're reacting the way you are, but I do think it's worth looking into."
Being emotionally dysregulated is common for ADHD
Splitting and being reactive and sabotaging your relationship is not ADHD but you didn’t devalue him in your post so not sure if that’s what’s happening
"It sounds more like you had big feelings about losing the feeling of how lucky you are and how strong the relationship really is, as if you are grieving the loss of that feeling, especially since hes your goto when you need to coregulate and now you don’t have that during times of conflict"
The emotional distance from him sounds painful for you
You might try calling a trusted friend or family member for emotional support when this happens.
I’ve been working on emotional regulation
"I’ve always been sensitive and emotional, but over time I’ve learned how to manage it for the most part"
I have really strong relationships so I don’t think it’s to the point where it affects them negatively
"Probably the opposite, I’m very empathetic."
That’s really spot on… my husband has a tendency to lash out and withdraw and that’s really painful for me… I think I have some abandonment issues
I also feel like I can’t tell other people much because I don’t want people to judge him
My family is protective of me
It’s a tough situation… that’s why I mentioned we are incompatible in that way… I’m very sensitive and emotional and crave connection and he has anger issues and is critical and pushes people away at times
That makes it sound worse than it is… we’re compatible in many many other ways and we have been together for 16 years and love each other deeply
But I would say that is the main incompatibility we haven’t been able to overcome despite it improving over the years
We both have ADHD so emotional regulation is a struggle.

"If you have a diagnosis, most schools have student services that can help with coaching and accommodations for ADHD"
Most schools also have counseling/therapy services available which can help you from a very personal level
"

For generic advice, here are some things you can do:

1"
Talk to you professors - let them know you are struggling
Ask for support
Show up to their office hours and ask for extra help
 Maybe even ask for extra credit if you are able
"

2"
Talk with other students
" Join/form study groups and use ithers to hold you accountable for studying and getting work done in time.

3"
Live by a calendar
Put everything on it
Assignment dates
Test dates
Block off study time for each class
Set riminders to work on assignments before they are due
Put literally everything on the calendar so you never get surprised by deadlines
A lot of tomes you can do a lot of this at the beginning of each semester or immediately whenever anything is assigned
"

Also, a D is still passing"
No need to retake the class unless you need the credit to transfer or maintain a specific GPA for program or scholarship reasons
Getting your diploma with a 2.5 is equivalent to getting it with a 4.0 for 99.9% of people.

My story and rage is 100% like you
Only one did that to you
4 did it do me
Completely rejected the idea
Like at least explore the idea if the patient or client is repeatedly mentioning something
Ridiculous.
You should sue his ass!!
I'm sorry
"I also wasn't diagnosed until around 41 or so -though the signs seem rather obvious in retrospect...Still seeking the right treatment years later and seemingly will be paying for my illness (financially and otherwise) for the rest of my life...

It's heartbreaking."
I self-diagnosed **correctly** at 32
It took 10 months and 3 different neurologists 🥺🫂
"Freshly diagnosed at 46! I will mention that 20 years ago ADHD was still mostly considered something boys grew out of. 


I had to clarify with my husband that people don't grow out of it, we just figure out tools for coping.


Congrats on your diagnosis and I hope life improves for you."
"Yeah my father is a GP who called me lazy, disorganized, destined to be a failure all my life"
"Not only I was diagnosed when I was 30 coincidentally, I also made him seek diagnosis."
"Ok I'm a bit younger than you(24) but I had the same experience you did, when I was 12 I had read a few articles about adhd and I was 100% sure I had it, and I talked to my gp about it and what I was experiencing, and the bitch basically told me that adhd was not a real condition and that I was just being lazy and needed to put more effort into school, 7 years later got diagnosed with adhd, and  2 years ago I decided put a complaint for malpractice and apparently as there were other people filling in complaints she was fired not long after(needless to say I was very happy to know that because full on untreated adhd fucked me up for several years)."

You’re going to hate this answer but you gotta go to the gym and get some of the hype out of you… possibly even twice a day
Sleep well and eat snacks
If that doesn’t work talk to your doc to see what they suggest and come up with a plan
"Also, good to ask yourself what will I do differently in my next job? Btw have you heard of Goblin Tools? A great place to start to breakdown overwhelming tasks/life."
 I could have written that myself down to the age I got diagnosed
I’m finding more that the office life isn’t for people like us and maybe you’re place of work is something with a lot of action and not in the confines of an office
"I hear you though it can take a disaterous toll on your self esteem as it did mine.

Keep going friend you got this"
"You’ve got to use this moment as like a turn around thing, look I just turned 15 and I don’t have a lot of good advice but I was doing like mid and then I got my diagnosis and just knowing helped me now I’m on vyvanse 30mg weekdays and when I’m not to get motivation and turn your life around you need 

Fast upbeat playlist no sad music
Natural light
A vision board (worked for me ) because it shows what you want to work towards 
To ask for HELP WHEN YOU NEED IT your ego can recover and people won’t see you as incompetent for asking my mum says it shows iniatuve and willingness to learn
Put quotes etc on your wall that motivar or make you happy
Have a calandra and a plan and try your best to follow it
Hit the gym or find a physical activity that you can enjoy with others maybe a run club or like a sport sports really help
It’s okay to not be like people with not ADHD they aren’t like u so don’t compare yourself
Talk to your doctor and maybe change ur meds if it feels like it’s not doing anything for you or take a break from them

If it’s not okay it’s not the end"
I am sorry this happened to you
This is actually the fault of the company
They didn't train you properly and then expected you to be able to work as if you were trained
"Yes, some people will be horrible to people they think they are better than, but that just means that they are the shit ones"
Please do some self care.
"Switch to vyvanse, it will give you the energy you’re lacking to keep up"
It’s been a game changer
You’re going to hate this answer but you gotta go to the gym and get some of the hype out of you… possibly even twice a day

If that doesn’t work talk to your doc to see what they suggest and come up with a plan
"Also, good to ask yourself what will I do differently in my next job? Btw have you heard of Goblin Tools? A great place to start to breakdown overwhelming tasks/life."
"Ah yes, I've definitely felt that ""shit at life"" disorder, or as I call it, ""lazy sack of shit"" disorder"
"I'm in this boat with you so I don't have much advice to give but this is where therapy becomes more effective than medication, for me at least"
"I've heard people say things like meds make things easier but you still have to learn how to do things and have strategies, and that include how to cope with the emotional disregulation that can happen"
"Sad to hear what happened to you...
34mg concerta is so low, no wonder it doesnt help you, switch straight to vyvanse, it is true life changer.."
"The gym is boring, I can't go to the gym"
I like walking
"

I have no problem sleeping either, but yeah I might need to talk to my doctor about my medication"
"It helps me stay awake during the day as I am often borderline narcoleptic without meds.

>Also, good to ask yourself what will I do differently in my next job?

Find a job where I can work at night maybe? Or set my own hours? I tried really fucking hard"
It was just overwhelming
"

>Btw have you heard of Goblin Tools? A great place to start to breakdown overwhelming tasks/life.

No, I haven't! Please do tell :-)"
I’ll +1 this
"Bought myself a barbell set and wow, its like instant medication"
Lifting really eases the tension of ADHD
I don’t have much life advice but I hope this helps I’m jus a 15yr old girl l
I hate the gym
I am also borderline narcoleptic
"Professional nap taker, anytime any where even with ADHD meds during the day… 

I love Pilates cause it is the easiest for me and almost like a nap of a workout- the only thing that has toned my nap figure and won’t miss! 

Goblin tools is awesome- check it out!"
Go run
Makes my brain chill
Do it in the am.

Different doses require a new PA
"I agree, it’s annoying."
"Damn, I didn’t know that"
"

I never needed the PA for my Vyvanse"
I just had the Adderall PA done a few weeks ago
"I guess I need ANOTHER one now for the dosage increase!? 

My doctor never mentioned it though, so I thought that was weird"
She mentioned the first one
It’s also weird bc I was on 10mg for a few days prior to my last appointment when  she decided to increase me to 20mg
"She told me just to take 2 of the 10mg pills until I run out, and let her know a couple days before I need the 20mg prescription sent in"
So I’ve already been on 20mg for a couple weeks now
This whole thing is annoying.

If every ADHD person in the world suddenly gets the hyper fixation to cure ADHD it might get done.
"Oh my gosh, I feel you"
So much
It’s soul crushing
I’m sorry
I love you 😢
"I don't think ADHD will ever be ""cureable"""
"You're basically asking for other genes and another brain.

Our brain is not sick"
"It's different.

Since ADHD is quite a widespread disorder, odds are that it had evolutionary benefits to either people with ADHD or communities with ADHD members.

Maybe right now you don't see the benefits yet, but things are chaning so fast in this world, you can never know where you will be in 10 years with your different brain."
Sounds like it's time to start working towards radical self acceptance and creating a life you actually want to live
Therapy might be a good start.
Ugh I feel for you (with you!) and I'd love to help
Can I ask if you're looking for empathy or solutions? I can offer both/either depending on what would help more
":)

Signed, a Neurogenetics PhD student with ADHD (medicated since high school)"
"What sucks is that in the past, It didn't matter so much if you had ADHD because most jobs were not office jobs"
"Now where everyone who wants to be successful is expected to get a college degree and largely have an office job, which is not good for most people with ADHD."
"It's genetic, and as somebody else here has said, any 'cure' would fundamentally change who we are as people as we wouldn't have the same brain anymore"
"

Now sure, some might try to argue that it's not that different from being medicated, but the thing with being medicated is that it's just a management of ADHD related symptoms and you have to keep taking stimulants every day (or whenever our clinicians said to take them)"
I know if I stop taking my stimulant medication that I'm pretty much back to square one even if I'm without them for a day and a half or so
"

It sucks.

Lastly, obviously I'm not a doctor nor expert on the matter, this is just my perspective."
We’re in the same boat
"My life has been hell for 29 years dealing with ADHD.

Shit I got fired from my new job today because I was working too slow which I thought I wasn’t the whole time"
"

"It gets worse if personal weaknesses aren’t addressed, and it gets manageable/better/good when learning to cope with the experience through trying strategies over the long term"
"

It’s a bag of a lot of hard things to deal with, but one can develop strength, perspicacity and practical wisdom from it"
"Once one gets stronger in a certain area, one keeps building on that new basis of strength.

As a 50 year old with ADHD there are days in which I feel I get crushed and want to curse everything"
"Then there are the other days, where this topic doesn’t come up mentally, or during which one sees what is working and what’s not, and it just becomes the road of life one is traversing"
"And as an ADHD guy, the openness and unwrittenness of the future part of that road is attractive in itself"
"

It doesn’t make me feel *good* to focus on what negative things I’ll have to deal with, it’s where a lot of negative ruminations and worrying comes to torment as one allows oneself to stay in those places.

I keep being surprised at what it means to have this thing on a long term basis, but after all is said, done, forgotten, misplaced, and lived, it’s normal to have those bad days"
"

It’s even statistically impossible for most people to stay in that negative headspace over long periods of time (unless it becomes a depression)"
"At some point, the brain is going to want to break into resolving manageable aspects"
"And depression is treatable.

"My cure was finding a career that was challenging, which for me involved going to college later in life for a dual economics / mathematics degree and getting a math heavy job"

Atleast adhd has meds to reduce the symptoms
I have asd and is stuck with it
I know it's frustrating
"I feel the same sometimes, and even medication sometimes for me is too much"
"It feels that I am exchanging some temporary peace of mind for a piece of my character which I like and I don't at the same time.

For years I was taking Ritalin and Concerta, and I felt that I could only function through taking the medication"
"Then it came to a point where I literally felt burned out by the medication(and other life factors), but I couldn't really stop.

The more I was thinking to go away from the medication, the higher the doses became...

I kinda feel lucky that through this process I stumbled upon a meditation up"
"Not in the sense of spiritual awakening or anything in that direction, but in the sense of mindfulness"
"It was hard, especially in the first 3 months, as my brain was doing its own thing while I was trying to be mindful, it was at some points horror"
"But I was still taking some medication, and slowly slowly reducing it without even noticing it, because I felt more and more and more okay with my scattered thoughts and constantly destructive attitudes"
" 
  
I came to a point where I would find it incredibly hard to focus on simple things whilst I was going through this process, but at some point, it just clicked.

I meditate almost every day for almost 2 years now"
Consistency is key here
"

However, being the ADHD junky I am, I never set myself rules or routines to keep up with, so it had to be whenever I remembered to, and I set time aside for it(10-15 minutes) at that point"
" 
  
I did not take any medication for at least 1.5 years, up until curiosity came back about, what would happen"
I felt awful
"It felt like someone was pressuring me to focus and it felt wrong.

I don't recommend this to anyone, and I am no doctor or an advise source"
This worked on me after years of struggling to battle ADHD
"Meditation brought me clarity and allowed me to step back and not identify with my thoughts, while allowing them to run freely and selectively choosing which one to onboard.

Again, consistency is key"
"And everything around the culture of meditation(given that you follow legitimate sources and practices), helps a lot with just accepting how things are, and dealing with them in a more permanent way kinda.

Once again, I ain't no doctor, or anyone that can guide you through your own journey"
"However, I felt this frustration, and I was this frustration for years"
"Personally, nothing else helped me as much as meditation"
"

Hope you get to find your way around dealing with ADHD! If you want some recommendations on meditation DM me and I will give you some sources"

It's a neurodevelopmental disorder
Our brains have developed differently than non-adhd individuals
"Since most of our brain development is done during childhood, there will most likely never be a cure, only treatments for the symptoms"
"Symptoms tend to lesson as you get older, presumably because we find ways to work with it"
"Many of of us, myself included, medicate to help alleviate the symptoms."
I’m just waiting until ai can be my own personal secretary
 Bothering me about appointments and such.
Lol cure.
its like trying to find a way to turn somebody's blue eyes brown without the use of lenses.
"my point is, it's not curable since it's not a disease"
I just really wanna give you a hug
"If you ever wanna talk, please reach out."
Embrace it my friend
Just know that your brain operates at a higher rate than most people so they need to catch up to you not you slow down for them
Once we try to slow our brains down and operate at the same level as normal people then depression forgetting everything etc
If you mind is telling you go then go once you start going it's easy to stay going
If this makes any sense
It makes sense in my head but reading it doesn't sound right lol
"Just remember, it could always be worse"
"You can have adhd & T1D, no cure for either of them"
"Me, I have them both"
"For someone with adhd having to do calculations before everything I drink & eat so I don’t accidentally kill myself with insulin, is a whole other level of mental 💩"
Learn to accept
have u tried using a planner?
"It's like diabetes, you can overcome it"
Heck most successful folks has ADHD/ASD take Bill Gates and Animators :) somehow you can get inspired by ADHD
The ADHD subreddit is extremely toxic
"The only opinion you are allowed to have about your own ADHD in that subreddit is that it’s the worst thing that’s ever happened to you, and that medication is a necessary and almost always excellent choice, and that any kind of non-medical coping strategy is just “neurotypical advice” even if it has been empirically demonstrated to be helpful for ADHD"
A lot of “i tried it once and it didn’t work therefore that doesn’t work for ADHD”
"Same vibes as “I exercised once and didn’t lose weight therefore exercise is pointless for me”.

Obviously this is an overgeneralisation, but I find the folks there to be incredibly reactive and intolerant to the slightest suggestion that ADHD can come with strengths as well as weaknesses (even when framed as only my own PERSONAL experience and not a generalisation) or that things like meditation, regular exercise, and using a planner can actually be hugely beneficial if you can successfully form the habit"
Forming habits is fucking hard with ADHD but not impossible
There is a real sense of learned helplessness there which leads to extreme defensiveness against anything that doesn’t align with their worldview.
Civilization is the one with the problem
"Between capitalism and religion, the twists of conformity are absurb"
So many pointless rituals are intertwined in even simple stuff.
I feel this
Too much.
I hear medication helps a lot.
Mine was “cured” for a couple of days before
Keeping it very vague for obvious reasons but I took a bunch of something to try to shut it off and it like factory reset my brain when I came to

"> Since ADHD is quite a widespread disorder, odds are that it had evolutionary benefits to either people with ADHD or communities with ADHD members.

Scientific research does not seem to agree with this"
There seems to have been a small but significant selective pressure *against* certain genes associated with ADHD pretty much throughout the existence of our species
"It's just not enough pressure to have removed ADHD from our gene pool.

Think about it - yes, it's a serious handicap, but it's not strong enough to reliably prune those who have it from the gene pool - it doesn't kill you before you can reproduce, it doesn't make you significantly less attractive, it doesn't impair your fertility, so you still get to pass it on to the next generation"
"The impact is small, but it's not zero, and as far as we can tell, ADHD was probably more common in paleolithic homo sapiens than it is today"
"Not by a huge margin, but still.

It's not an evolutionary advantage, it's just not enough of a disadvantage to be eliminated quickly."
Our brain is not sick
It's dysfunctional
"
With a neurodevelopmental disorder."
"I don’t think they meant it literally, I think it was more of a way to say “this sucks and I hate it.”"
I wouldn’t be surprised if a big number of explorers had ADHD.
No
"No benefits, stop romanticizing this disorder"
"Nothing is great about it.

I can’t remember this study but it pretty much said, it isn’t because of an evolutionary purpose but really random mutations, hence why it doesn’t leave the population"
Strongly disagree: ADHD is a combination of generic and environmental factors
"Some of those environmental factors, they've already shown can be minor things that cause fairly moderate changes in the brain and body, such as the gut microbiome, and specific dietary specifications"
"On the other hand, the generics of ADHD are complex, yet gene therapy is a thing already for several conditions, and emerging and a tentative option for others"
"I'm pretty optimistic that *some* more specified and direct treatment, at the least, will present itself on the next decade"
"Outright ""cure"", maybe not, but we can probably het pretty close to that."
>Our brain is not sick
It’s different
" 
  
And then, in nearly the same breath:  
  
>ADHD is quite a widespread disorder  
  
🙄 Do people even think about the words they say?"
Yeah i feel like it is becoming so widespread that it is part of our evolution.
yep i feel like the slightly extreme version of that is those digital nomads...
i feel like adhders could be a few of them living in the modern world THRIVING..
probably never diagnosed or know they are adhd...
"dam this thought bring me to remember about Casey Neistat....

//you can ignore this comment its just a random thought i had"
Yep.
our brains aren't cut out for 95% of the current capitalistic work force ..
Other way around
I think it’s also important to point out that ADHD is like one of THE most treatable psychiatric conditions
"From a societal standpoint, ADHD really sucks with today’s standards"
"But on the other hand, medication for ADHD is way more effective than a majority of psychiatric medications"
"If it weren’t for the government’s scare tactics to make ADHD meds look evil, there would literally be no incentive for companies to even work on finding alternative treatments and medications for ADHD—there’d be no point, there’s already reliable, effective medications with much less/more tolerable side effects available"
"

Consider other conditions like depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, OCD, PTSD, etc—the reason there’s incentive to keep working on meds for these is because there’s so many people that it’s not working for, because the treatments are ineffective or intolerable"
"

I don’t want to dismiss anyone who’s had negative experiences with ADHD medications—I’m discussing this on a population level, not a personal level"
There are still going to be people who cannot tolerate or do not find ADHD medications to be effective
"But overall, ADHD meds work really fucking well."
It's not entirely genetic
"While it does appear to be highly heritable, there is a minority of people who clearly have ADHD but do not seem to fit any of the identified genotypes.

Moreover, twin studies have found that while if one identical twin has ADHD it's about 80% likely that their twin will as well, there's still about 20% of identical twins who have ADHD and have a non-ADHD twin"
We don't know why.
It makes perfect sense!
I currently have like 5 and don’t know where I wrote the info I need and where it could be so I gotta track down all 5
I think I’m gonna put notes and photos in Evernote but keep winding up on app deep dives and my phones almost out of storage but I can’t focus long enough to learn the ins and outs of one of them well
"And I might be missing out on the GOAT if I limit myself to that one! So I need to evaluate all apps, pick perfect planner, find and rewrite or photo & organize old notes once I decide on app(s)"
THEN it will be so easy for me to tackle my 1 year behind to do list! I also have several magnetic lists and a giant white goal setting white board and a mess of ripped out magazine pics for my vision board that I will start once i tackle my to do list! Cant be fully fun and creative til then! So I’ll just spend 5 minutes flipping through this magazine and rip out just one image for my vision board to remind myself how great it will feel when to do list is done and I can be the creative person I wanna be and used 10 boxes of hoarded art supplies
But first I gotta find & take the insulin I should’ve taken hours ago before Reddit and eating and all the other bs I just wasted 5 hours on
FML
I can’t stand myself most of the time
I can’t even schedule the appt to hopefully begin medication process cuz I dread the judgment despite being diagnosed at age 6 in the 80s I didn’t wanna try meds until a few years ago and then adderall shortage and dr shortage and all this bs making my life further unmanageable…
"dont put us down! we would get all the way, but forget to save it, or spill a drink on the hard drive."

There are many kinds of love
You can say you love someone in a supportive and platonic way.
Yes
They are OP
Everyone in this post knows and loves OP!
It seems most plausible that the traits were at least somewhat beneficial at *some* point given that they continue to be present in roughly the same portion of the population across many geographically isolated ethnic and cultural groups
"It is likely, though, that whatever that benefit they provided ceased to be advantageous sometime in the prehistoric period."
Why are you getting down voted? Is it because truth is a hard thing to grasp?
Pointing out specific strengths of people with ADHD is not “romanticizing” it
"Meanwhile,
Only considering the negatives and viewing it as just a curse isn’t helpful to anyone!

Personally, I LOVE other people with ADHD"
"My best friends all have ADHD, and I work with ADHDers as a therapist with for a living"
People with ADHD tend to be much more interesting to me
So I see one benefit right there
"Lots of star Athletes have it, like Jordan, Kobe, Michael Phelps, Josh Allen and Simone Biles, and the ability to hyperfocus seems to have been critical to their success"
Not to mention guys like Bill Gates and Richard Branson
"Exceptional creativity, resilience, performance under pressure and outside the Box thinking are other common traits that tend to come along with ADHD"
"

We shouldn’t minimize either the disadvantages *or* the advantages!"
Random mutations constantly happen and go all sorts of directions
This is one reason why people differ so much
Ours just cause us problems and distress in our specific environment
"

We’re not romanticizing our disorder"
We’re de-stigmatizing it
De-pathologizing it.
"I’m sure you’ve heard the stat that by the age of 12, kids either ADHD will receive 20,000 more negative messages than those without.

Nobody is romanticizing ADHD"
"We’re trying to tell ourselves that our brain aren’t broken, they just work differently"
We’re trying to appreciate those differences
"I spent too long shitting on myself, please don’t put others down for trying to make the best of their situation."
I feel like being able to hyper focus on specific tasks for hours at a time is definitely a benefit in certain situations
"Back before technology people had a lot of times on their hands and I'm sure many technological advancements and art were made because of that ""dedication""."
"Gene therapy is currently for monogenic (single gene) disorders, which ADHD is almost definitely not"
"It’s also only safely applied to tissue outside the body, for example if we extract immune cells and then put them back in the body, or we edit skin in a Petri dish"
"We *definitely* are nowhere near gene therapy for disorders of the brain, that is both feasibly and ethically a pipe dream at this point in time"
"1) it is extremely difficult to get things past the blood brain barrier and into the correct brain tissue, and 2) the potential for off target effects (such as brain cancer) mean there isn’t a regulatory body in this universe that would approve this.

Also none of those things (eg microbiome) you discuss have been shown to be part of the cause of ADHD"
"It’s more likely that ADHD *causes* an altered gut microbiome, not the other way around"
Studies can’t really shown xyz causes ADHD because ADHD is present since birth and therefore can’t be induced in a lab.
>combination of genetic and environmental factors
"

This could be said about pretty much any normal part of an individual human’s development."
Nobody’s brain is suitable for the modern American version of capitalism.
How? Many more jobs in the past involved working with your hands.
"Oh, I wholeheartedly agree"
"I still don't comprehend why I didn't bother getting evaluated, diagnosed (for ADHD, I didn't get officially diagnosed until a little bit more than a year ago now), and then prescribed stimulants a lot sooner but it's better late than never"
So much unneeded suffering (not that I think that suffering is a good thing Lol) I went through thanks to ADHD as well as time wasted that perhaps wouldn't have had to have been wasted if I had just gotten diagnosed and medicated sooner
"

I don't disagree that those who suspect that they have ADHD should get checked out, in my case I vehemently am somewhat still upset that my former self actually thought that being medicated would turn me into a zombie or have unbearable side effects when in fact it's benefited me far more than I could have imagined."
I see
"I don't doubt the possibility of what you say, but, do you have any citation? I ask so that I may be informed/educated and for future reference."
I feel ya
"The amount of journals, planners and calendars I have sitting unused all over my house is embarrassing.."
"Consistency just isn't our strong suit eh

I hope the meds get sorted for you, they haven't totally fixed my executive dysfunction, but they definitely help a lot"
"I can actually sorta (sometimes) do some of the things I need to without spending days or weeks trying to get myself to do them.

I got diagnosed earlier this year and the first thing my boss told me literally ""Have you tried using a planner?"" and when I told him I have many, many times he said I just needed more ""discipline"", shits great.."
To someone you don't know? I find that strange to love a stranger
Myopia is also hereditary and Down syndrome is well-distributed
" What would be the evolutionary advantage of nearsightedness?  Or in the case of ADHD, impaired verbal and non-verbal working memory?"
"That’s because ADHD is a phenotype which is realized via multiple alleles - and just because you remove all those alleles from the gene pool at time A, doesn’t mean mutations won’t occur (or re-occur) that cause them later at time B in conjunction with recombination. "
"Because thé evolutionary advantage theory is at the heart of a popular book about ADHD, written by someone who is not an expert on evolution.

The book is a good read, but it doesn't mean it's always accurate."
I can’t hold as many things in my short-term memory as my co-workers and I have to work around it
"My brain is broken, not just different"
What I do is accept it and work to become the best _me_ that I can be in spite of my limitations
And that’s something I’m proud of
"At its best, the community is helping us learn to prosper in spite of those limitations."
ADHD is a sickness that needs to be eradicated and if there was a cure for it I would do anything in the world to have it.
Hyperfocus <> flow state
"When I’m in a flow state, I’m the best damn programmer on my team"
"When I’m hyper focusing, I’m spending two hours trying to squeeze a few more milliseconds out of a process optimization I should have checked in this morning because the challenge interests me."
This
The only positive I can think of is the ability to hyper focus
I think of it as my secret super power
"As long as I find the topic interesting, give me a day and I can be an expert in it"
"I agree with most of your comment, but bear in mind that there are currently a lot of ongoing clinical trial regarding brain-targeted gene terapy"
I know that because my wife is affected by a single-gene mutation that will led her to early onset dementia
It’s pretty simple to get things past the blood brain barrier if you use a siringe to deliver a viral vector directly in the cisterna magna!
One of the many things I melted down about when I started my period 🥲 i swear to God I hate being a woman and wish I can end my periods
"speak for yourself, I got my math equations and my adderal"
I love getting lost in thought
"I have a few, unfortunately most of them are paywalled"
Here is one from Dr
"Faraone which fortunately is open access:

[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-018-0070-0#Sec14](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-018-0070-0#Sec14)"
"People who are blind typically develop more acute hearing than average as the brain finds other ways to use the visual cortex.

It is plausible that myopia could similarly afford the brain slightly better capacity for other tasks, which could be advantageous if better distance vision isn't useful in the local environment"
"There has been some research on that topic, although it's not conclusive at this point.

In the case of ADHD, the hypotheses mostly revolve around herd safety from predators afaik."
What you say makes sense but you’re doing your self a disservice if you think the short term memory is the yard stick to measure the effectiveness of your brain
"Your brain creates your reality and everything in it, it senses your surroundings, it defines your ideas of good and bad"
"Everything you love is created in your brain, every great memory, every great moment"
"The person you wish you were, your brain created all that and more"
"Fuck working memory IMO, where we’re going you won’t even need to remember because you will be too busy trying not to get killed by massive animals or by “savages” coming over the walls, etc"
Who hurt you? You need a hug
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|put_back)
"Ooh that’s exciting, do you happen to know the study group? I’m very interested in their delivery method, it’s difficult to get the gene therapy constructs/viral vectors into neurons without damaging them so it’s very cool that it sounds like there’s something in the works"
"You’re totally right, it is easy to bypass the blood brain barrier through direct injection, though it’s considerably more dangerous and hence I don’t think would be approved for ADHD, whereas it’s relatively easy to get approved for conditions such as AD and motor neuron disease.

I’m very sorry about your wife, here’s hoping this trial is successful, it would save countless lives"
"Early onset AD has some of the most brilliant minds working on treatments, I do think it will be a thing of the past within our lifetimes"
Is it APOE e4?
"""speak for yourself, I got my anti-ADHD medication 😎"""
Thanks.
"This is great, thanks for the link!"
"lol I’m short sighted, have tinnitus and poor hearing"
Definitely would trade it for 20:20 vision
"Blind people HAVE to develop other skills as a coping mechanism, it’s not that they’re born that way, and they don’t develop them to a superhuman level"
I wouldn’t call coping mechanisms advantages. 
"That’s interesting, especially about myopia"
I have read about the possible “herd” advantage of altruism 30+ years ago when that idea was popular
I had never considered it in the context of ADHD.
"The study I’m monitoring is ASPIRE-FTD from Passage Bio.
She’s affected by a mutation in the GRN gene, involved in the progranulin encoding.
It’s not AD, her disease is called bvFTD"
"
That said, even if a “cure” via gene editing was available, I won’t consider it"
"
My ADHD is pretty severe but is not a life threatening condition and is manageable with current therapy."
"Yes, I hate having ADHD,"
Even then it won't expand my mental stamina
I am also nearsighted and would readily give it up
"It's definitely *not* an advantage in today's society.

However, you should keep in mind that we aren't evolved for today's society"
"Evolution takes tens of thousands of years and it is possible that distance sight was not as important in parts of our species' ancestral history as it is today.

It's possible there were periods in prehistory where some humans were more nocturnal or more active in the twilight hours, and in those times of day sight is less important"
"Our genetic material is largely optimized for a time period thousands of years ago, not the modern culture that has arisen in the last two centuries.

Traits that have ceased to be advantageous but aren't being actively discouraged by natural selection will take hundreds of generations to disappear from the population."
That's because your brain isn't suitable for the modern American version of capitalism.

"The constant circle of ‘run out of meds, need to go to the pharmacy, need meds to get to the pharmacy’ is over"
Now I order my meds online for next day delivery and everything has improved.
Has the med shortage ever affected your ability to get your script on time? I’m trying to decide if it’s worth it to switch insurances for a higher copay that offers mail order.
"Yes, it has at times"
I’m in the UK so it’s probably a bit different here but we have been affected by global shortages
"In desperate situations, I find that hospital pharmacies are always better stocked than high street ones or online"
"That being said, online pharmacies will dispense meds as soon as they have them, which saves you the legwork of constantly checking in with physical pharmacies to see if they’ve re-upped"
"I’ve also found it easier to slightly over-order my meds from online pharmacies to cushion the blow of shortages.

Edit: forgot to add, I’m not sure about the insurance of it all"
"My meds are prescribed via our national health service so maybe if I went with private healthcare I could avoid the shortages better, I’m not sure"
It would be 10x as expensive to purchase the meds tho so I don’t think I’d bother.
Thank you for your insight
I really appreciate the reply!

"Hi! I had this exact situation! I started on the same extended release and tried 18 mg, 27 mg, and 36 mg with not much luck"
I had the best results with 36 mg but was still all over the place without help with focus
My anxiety was feeling a little better but I needed more
My doc switched me to 20 mg XR Adderall and it’s been a night and day difference
Now my mind is actually quieter and I’m remembering things and answering work emails on time without procrastinating for days
"It’s not perfect, I still hate starting my day and it takes me forever to get ready"
I still can nap on my meds and feel low energy at times
But I think I have the results of what I need for meds
I’m also realizing nothing will be perfect for me
"Some people talk about being able to work for hours without stopping but maybe I’m just not built that way? Lol either way, hopefully you can try another med soon! It helped me a ton."
Nurse here
 The only methylphenidate XL that works right is brand name Concerta
 Period.
okay thank you so much! my psychiatrist doesn't want to give me adderall but ill see if a higher dose on methylphenidate works for now :)
Yeah I think it’s worth a try! 36 is the most common dose for adults so totally normal if you didn’t feel results before then :) I’d give it a shot first before switching!

my boyfriend wants to break up with me because i'm lazy with chores

I've been there
It's horrifying
"

But also, this sounds like abusive behaviour"
"The not-abusive way to deal with this would have been to raise it calmly at a normal time of day and even - just maybe - come to you with solutions, rather than making it a complete dealbreaker.."
A true partner wants to work on problems together
"

Also, he's not your maid, but you are also not \*his\* maid.

When my ex did this to me (kept snapping at me about messiness, undermined my efforts, never suggested solutions, and then used it as part of his reasoning to break up) I also tried to think of anything I could to fix it, but you know what? Seriously: good riddance."
It's ok for people to feel frustrated their partner isn't doing chores in a timely manner
  It's not ok to wake up someone at 2am to yell about some clothes on the couch
  It's also not ok to refuse to speak to you for 24 hours because he's punishing you over chores
   His behavior is not healthy or loving
"    

His aggressive attitude probably isn't helping your self esteem"
   It's not ok if he's calling you names such as lazy
"   

You're doing the best you can"
   Beating yourself up won't change who you are
"    If he can't accept you as you are, he needs to leave."
I know how hard it is to not be able to do chores and also when the person you are living with gets mad about it
"I'm not even that bad, and he doesn't do anything, but that's another story 😅 If he's right, I think the most important thing is to acknowledge that it is a problem for you"
"Tell him it's hard but don't use it as an excuse, that will probably only make him more frustrated, I get irritated when people are making excuses"
Tell him you know you are that way and that you will try to be better.
"You might very well be lazy with chores, but you might also have a shitty boyfriend"
The first time someone I'm in a relationship with woke me up in the middle of the night to scream at me about stupid shit like chores would be the last day of the relationship.
"As others have told you, waking you up at 2:30 AM to yell at you is just not right, that's not how an emotionally stable person behaves and it's not something to be overlooked.

I have been living together with my boyfriend for almost 2 years now, he knew very well how messy I was before we moved in together, but he has never made me feel ashamed about it"
"When the house is getting overly messy with my stuff or I haven't done chores I'm supposed to do, he tells me in a playful way to clean up, or we clean together on the weekends, and so far it has worked.

I recently saw the book How to Keep House While Drowning recommended here in reddit, I bought it and it has good tips to get chores done and not feel overwhelmed, it's also very easy to read or you could get the audiobook.

Don't hold to the idea that he is your one and only love, that's how I felt with someone for years and after we split and I said I was done looking for love, my current boyfriend, now fiancé, said ""Hello! 😉"""
He's 10x better than the other person I thought was my one and only
We just don't know what life has in store for us.
His behaviour isn't ok and definitely doesn't indicate that he's someone worth fighting for
"Obviously I don't know the details of your relationship, but the loving and understanding way of confronting you about this would've looked way different"
Sounds to me like you might be better off without him.
Dump him
"I know, I know, I know that this is what we all say on reddit and I am not saying you shouldn't be concerned with how you keep your home, because that is important, but what you just described is not ok"
"You can try your hardest, but no matter what you do, that guy you love so much with still feel entitled to wake you up in the middle of the night and yell at you like youre a kid"
"You are not a child, you are a grad student who is also maintaining a job on the side"
You do not deserve to be treated that way AND the fact that he's yelling at you and threatening to leave you is a HUGE RED FLAG! That is not normal behavior
Get out of this before it is too late
Trust me
I was made to feel horrible about myself because I can be messy and I spent decades of my life with someone who made me feel like crap because he knew he could
Get out of this now
"Trust me, there are better men out there and even if there isn't, you will be happier without being yelled at or having love withheld from you for not being tidy."
"When we met, she was diagnosed already"
"In the beginning I saw, how much she tries and that it just don’t work"
I knew It’s not her fault
So I just accepted that certain things are in my responsibilty
Also how I feel and act
We could improve the situation a lot by hiring a household helper
"So we can split the money even and no ones feels, that one does more than the other"
There are still things
"We also have the agreement, that her room stays her room"
I don’t clean or make comments
"Only sometimes if I search for our plates 😅

I am now also diagnosed"
"My way which works somehow, that I can’t get realaxed it things ar visible-to-do"
No idea it this can be helpful for you to define a clean-up-space together were both can put things and one has to do it
Then with a cross system taking notes if it’s balanced
"

Personally I accept how things are and try to focus all the great things we have together"
You two are not compatible
"You can’t really go back from having yelled at someone, regardless of how righteously frustrated he may have been"
"That will always hang over you as a couple.

Now that you are medicated, you can take some time out to get your routines in order"
That’s just something that needs to be done if you want to share a home with someone else
"As Master Yoda says, “Do or do not - there is no try”"
"It’s a prerequisite of cohabitation.

I’ve been single for over 20 years because I couldn’t do this while undiagnosed, no matter how I tried"
"Now I can, and I do"
"If I get sick, it piles up a bit for a few days, but then I’m right back on the horse again.

It will be a lifelong struggle, but keeping my home pleasant and presentable is doable with meds and routines"
"Now I just choose to remain single.

Don’t beat yourself up for not being naturally organized, but also don’t kid yourself; above-average messiness is not acceptable in a partner or even roomie for most people.

Try the resources people have recommended"
"Also perhaps meditate a bit on what *you* want, what makes *you* feel good - in your home and in a relationship.

Best of luck to you! 💎"
Are you medicated?
It's not an office
you aren't work-mates
"If that is his attitude, I'd question not only his motives for being involved with you, but also his ultimate plans for your relationship"
"I have a friend who married a guy who really seemed to have his stuff together, then it turned into her own little handmaid's tale: she was a photographer, but he didn't allow her photos to be displayed in the house; she had to cook, clean and take care of his kid; despite her extreme efforts, he was constantly disappointed in her"
"I'm not saying that will happen to you, but he sure sounds like a similar type."
Waking somebody up at 2am to yell at them for ANY reason is INSANE
I would immediately leave that place and go sleep somewhere else
If you can't sleep in peace how the fuck are supposed to do anything else? He sounds like a horrible man and a child
Refusing to speak is child behavior
Communication is key in a relationship and refusing to speak makes everything worse
You should leave him
"i tried, but he didn't say anything in response and still wants to break things off anyway.."
"i really really am determined to change now, and i didn't use it as an excuse as much as i tried to explain why i might be so inclined to avoid clutter and the mess, but i think a bit now and i realise it may have just all come across as an excuse when i just wanted him to understand.."
"i don't know how else to convey my sincerity if im not given the time to prove it, you know what i mean? but youre right i should not have brought it up in the first place"
And You’re absolut okay how you are
Don’t try to promises things which are such a big leap to make
Better start with something which works and he sees it too and going together further
And he needs to help you with it
"yes, on concerta, since may"
“I tried” yeah um you were supposed to do it… not sticking to your word leads to trust issues and is a huge red flag
" It’s understandable for someone to break up with another if they don’t clean up after themselves, but not sticking to your word on top of that is obviously going to lead to a breakup.


You clearly didn’t respect his word when you were with him, what says you are if you get with him again?"
Hmm
That's very relevant
"

Distribution of chores is a really common frustration point for couples"
"I don't have any great solutions, but a professional might help get you on the right track if you're within network for one and he's willing to see if it'll make a difference!"
"i think i would appreciate a professional, i might have to seriously consider getting back into therapy 😭 thank you so much for the suggestion"
For sure! Good luck with everything - hopefully he cranks down and chills out!

30mg was already too high for me and I didn't like it at 30mg
But I love it at 20mg or even 25mg
"15mg was also ok for a while, but less effective than 20mg.

Google ""vyvanse water titration"" and I would start on either 15mg (half of a 30mg dose per day) or 20mg (2 x 30mg split accross 3 days) and then go up or down 5mg after a week, depending on how you feel.

When I took too much (30mg being too much for me back then), I felt ""zombified"", lost all desire/appetite/interest and felt like a drone"
"Somewhat content maybe but also not happy or ""alive"""
"At the right dose it just makes me overall less depressed, and more happy and alive.

It is possible that different ADHD subtypes *need* to get into the physical mechanism that for me was too much, to get sufficient symptom relief"
In terms of the classical ADHD issues like procrastination etc
"it does nothing for me unfortunately.

When you first start taking stimulants you might feel euphoric, but (sadly) that doesn't last longterm"
"Consider it a pleasant side-effect, but not the intended effect."
"I really appreciate this post, I will review and respond with my feedback and let you know how I get on"
Thank you so so much for taking the time to tell me your experiences.

talk to your doctor! you probably just need a higher dosage
"i felt minimal difference in dosages until i reached 40mg, where i felt more differences but definitely not as many as i should have"
i’m now on 60mg and feel a huge difference. 

What do you guys use for reminders?

I add things to the calendar and add a reminder notification for 1 week before and a second one for the day before!
If you’ve updated to ios18 you can schedule text messages up to two weeks out
So I schedule texts to myself to send for when they’ll actually be helpful
"Here are some strategies that have helped me:

-literal alarms with noise or, just titling your alarm that morning as the event"
"In this instance I would label it “therapy!!🚨”

-calendar reminders (add events in your calendar and you can get multiple reminders about the event before it happens)

-writing a “to-do list” in my notes app, screenshotting it, and setting it as my Lock Screen

-having a large whiteboard in my room 

-having MULTIPLE calendars (I have a paper book copy, whiteboard calendar and a calendar in my phone)— it forces you to write it out a couple times and have many places to see the events (it’s also kind of fun for me haha)

-sticky notes on your wall"
"I also have a little jar that once a task/ event is completed, I can crumple up the sticky note and put it in the jar"
"Once I fill my jar, I get myself a small treat! (Ik, sounds childish but it’s very effective lol)

All of these might sound a bit excessive but I’m going to be a teacher right away here and have to MAKE SURE I can stay on top of my life events haha"
I hope at least one of these can help!
I double triple remind myself
"I put the appt in Google calendar with a reminder notification an hour before, and then I schedule an alarm in the clock app, and I put an alarm on my watch."
Following because I did the exact same thing yesterday..
I used to use apple reminders but then some settings changed or something and now my phone doesn't remind me...
i put appointments in the calendar on my iphone and set the reminder alerts it has on the calendar app
"i'll usually have it remind me the day before and then an hour before, or if it's scheduled really far out i'll have it remind me a week before and then an hour before (i do wish you could do 3 alerts, idk why there's only 2)

not sure if this would work for everyone but it's the only thing i can do that kinda works"
I’ve got an app called Due
You set reminders and it basically keeps going off every five minutes until you mark it as done
It’s the only thing that’s worked for me.
Apple Watch and SIRI is a game changer
"Actually the Reminders app on my iPhone, it somehow ended up the only to-do list app I could use for more than a month.

Now that it’s integrated with Calendar, it’s even better and I can go take a look at the past days to see what I’ve done when, which gives me some perspective"
Super helpful with my time-blindness.
"I second the setting an alarm and naming it something, putting things in my calendar with reminders is helpful too"
I would also let your therapist know you didn’t get the text and make sure nothing happened on their end
You can also ask if they can send multiple alerts like texts and emails
"Personally I keep trying new things but i always go back to a good, classic paper planner!! 

I am picky about my planner, I need a whole week per page and lots of room to write on each day so I can write down all the little things too and I like it big enough I can’t lose it in my work bag lol"
I have Gcal and two other calendar apps that I link to gcal so I end up getting all the notifications a bunch of times each LOL
Outlook
I use the calendar app on my phone and set like 3 reminders.
"I am a paper planner girl, through and through"
"I have it with me at home, I take it to work, I even take it on trips! I used to color-code it back in college but nowadays I just make sure everything important gets written down."
Things (only for Apple devices) has been managing my life for years
"Without it, I don’t even know who I am."
Calender with reminders on Android
"reminders hours and days before, depending on what it's about"
 In some cases I add alarm clock app on Android
"
I it's with tickets I hang them in plain sight"
"
I try to maintain a habit to check my Calendar every morning.
I was also using a 2nd brain program called logseq, I love it"
"I use it as info hub, reminder and dairy"
"It's like obsidian and notion, bit for cool kids only😎"
I use a widget on my phone screen to pull up my calendar
"Firstly, give yourself some grace"
"I’ve done this so many times lol, luckily my therapist is pretty chill and usually jumps on a zoom after calling me to ask where I am.

Lately I’ve been using the app Finch, it’s the first one in a long time that I’ve stuck with"
"Great for daily habits AND reminders, and they’ve made it fun :)"
Hope that helps x
"Calendar event that reminds me 1 week, 1 day, 2 hours, and 1 hour before"
"

My best hack is an Amazon Alexa though"
It’s super easy to set up a reminder if you’re home because you just talk to it so you can’t get lost in something else on your phone
Also mine is set up so it texts me so I get the reminder even if I’m not within earshot when it goes off
"

If I’m not home and I need to set an Alexa appointment reminder I text myself so I’ll see the notification later and set it up."
Old school pen and notebook
Check your calendar every day! Put your appointments in your mobile calendar all the same color
Set an alarm to go off at the same time everyday
If you remember an appointment a week out set an alarm reminder for that upcoming day and time
"

I love the app structured so much I paid for it for a year!!!

I also use google keep and label my notes"
"I carry a notepad on me too for miscellaneous questions I get in college classes or to ask my doctor.

Still though I messed up an important appointment time by over an hour recently"
It sucked and I was lucky my psychiatrist had an opening the next week!
Thank you sir! You've just made me realize I had forgotten mine yesterday! 😅🥲
really simple but the reminders app and post it notes really help me
i place a lot of post it notes on my bathroom mirror so i’ll remember it when i wake up and start to get ready yk
" I’m not sure if there is an app where you can set alarms days in advance however setting an alarm that is labelled with what you need to do is a good way to remind yourself, but REMEMBER to label the alarm the amount of times I’ve set an alarmed and not labelled it and just turned it off because I’m like “that’s weird why is an alarm going off” jsndkdn"
Alexa! I can verbally say ‘remind me of this at this time on this day’ or ‘add this to my shopping list’ and it automatically goes to my phone! Life changing
Calendar and reminder app on my phone
"Do you use a digital calendar app (Google Calendar, or Apple Calendar)? If not, that’s where I’d start"
"A good, up-to-date digital calendar that is checked at least once a day is absolutely indispensable for me"
It allows me to offload a ton of information that my brain would otherwise waste time worrying about
"

If you already use a digital calendar, then what’s worked for me is 1) reviewing that calendar every morning, and 2) setting alarms on my phone for when I need to start getting ready for the appointment"
"

I use a habit tracker app to help me establish a few really important habits every day, and one of them is “Review Today’s Schedule”"
"If I accomplish that, then I’m golden for the day"
Even if I’m spacing out/hyperfocused/etc my alarm will save me
"

Pro tip: you can use Siri to set alarms on iOS, and you can also give the alarms a label so you remember what they were for"
"“Hey Siri, set alarm for 3:15pm for Get ready for therapy” is what works best for me"
"

So it’s “Hey Siri, set alarm for [TIME] for [LABEL]”"
Just make sure to specify AM vs PM so you don’t get a 3:15am alarm waking you up for your nonexistent midnight therapy.
I have to use my calendar app on my iphone...synced with my google calendar
And I set a couple reminders
"One for an hour before the event, and one for 10 minutes before the event"
I do this *sometimes*
When I remember
"On the times I don't remember, I focus on my mantra ""Be with yourself"""
ADHD is a tricky bastard sometimes.
My Apple Watch has been a lifesaver
Between having what’s next up in my day on the watch face and being able to utilize Siri for on the go reminders
It also reminds me to drink water and take my meds.
"“Hey Siri.”  

Hmmmm?

“Set a reminder for whatever date I have something”

Repeat for “Set a reminder to remind me I have an appointment coming up”"
I recommend Google calendar if you have an iPhone because I find the Apple calendar to also be confusing and it’s harder to use than Google.
I just ask Siri to remind me at a certain day/time or add events to calendar for me
"I also use the built in reminders app, but I’ll have it tell me multiple times in the days leading up to the appointment or thing I have to do"
I will also set a titled alarm if I have to or it’s very important to me
"I had to reduce the number of things that shows on my Home Screen to increase visibility of reminders, delete reminders I don’t need anymore, try not to use daily reminders, etc"
"I also will write paper notes and stick them by my keys or on the top of the toilet tank, etc"
my husband and a big paper calendar.
“Hey siri set a reminder to blah blah blah” and I keep it on the first page of my iphone
"I set so many reminders on my phone, and I have a work phone where I set work reminders"
"My personal reminders I always clear out, but sometimes my work reminders just pile up"
"then I started putting reminders in my work calendar on outlook, and the same thing happens.

cut to—I currently have a post-it stuck to the back of my phone I’m typing this out on with the two tasks I NEED to do tonight that I will not let go of until it’s done."
I use the calender widget on iPhone
I have an android phone so I don't know if this works the same on iPhone
" 

I put things in Google calendar and add a bunch of notifications"
"I do one the night before, and at like 2 hours before, 1 hour before, 30 min before.."
also if it's something I need any sort of prep for I do a notification a day or two ahead and don't clear it until I do the thing I need to do
 Basically I just make the phone keep reminding me so it's at the top of my mind.
I'm an android user
"

But I use a combination of things to help me be on track.

For this case, i have several things"
"

1.) A reminder to complete my intake form"
I'm required to complete one before the appointment
I have a reminder set to 10am
Why? Because 8am is too early
12pm the link expires
"10am is the time when I don't have much going on (on average) so it's easier to complete tasks instead of saying ""I'll do it later"" because then I don't do it"
I also get a text for the assessment link
"

2.) A reminder to get ready for my appointment

3.) A reminder to leave to my appointment"
"

4.) Have a calender entry with 3 reminders (day before, one hour, and 15 minute because my therapist is 10 minutes away)

5.) I use both alexa and Google home devices to audibly reminder me of reminders and calendar events"
"


It's overkill but I learned years ago before I knew I had adhd that I could not keep up with my life"
"So if it's not in the calendar, 90% chance I'll forget or double book"
"Which then causes other types of problem like ""can I afford to lose my job if I miss this meeting because I found out about it 30 minutes ago"""
I use calendar reminders on my phone
I check my calendar every day (monthly view)
I also set alarm reminders the day before for the next day
Alarms to wake up
Alarms to remind me to leave the house by a certain time so I'm not late
"After the one-time event, I delete the alarms."
"I use several different apps, including Reminders.

One app that is worth looking at on the iPhone is Due"
One of the good things about Due is that you can make it nag you lots
You can tell it to keep reminding you about a thing until you check it off as done
"It is harder to ignore than Reminders is and probably a little more simple to use for just basic reminders.

[https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/due-reminders-timers/id390017969](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/due-reminders-timers/id390017969)

But that said, for things like appointments I use the calendar on the iPhone"
I personally use the Fantastical app to manage my calendars
"But even the built in Calendar app will let you set two separate alerts for an event, so for example you can set one the day before and one an hour before:

[https://imgur.com/a/Nbl1XS1](https://imgur.com/a/Nbl1XS1)

(you can also have it take travel time into account, if you set it to alert you “At time of event”)"
"My smart watch, it's linked to my calendar and I put pre-meeting reminders when I have to leave, so my watch buzzes when it's time.

It also works great for my meds, 3 times a day buzz buzz buzz 😂"
"This is my method, but more! I have different categories of calendar events, and each category has its own reminder scheme"
"A dentist appointment for example, goes under Misc Appts, and I get reminded one week before, two days before, morning of, and an hour before"
"

Important Birthdays are their own category, and I get reminded every week for a month before, so I can remember to send a card or a gift"
"Causal birthday are just day of, so I can send  a text"
"Etc, etc."
"That's it? I set a reminder for 3 days before, 8am the day of, an hour before, and 20-30 minutes before."
Genius!
"I’m curious as to why you wouldn’t just use the Calendar app for things like that ?

There you can set it to send you alerts for events, without the two week limitation and you’d then have a calendar with a list of events/appointments in it."
"You can also put Notes or Reminders on your home screen, using widgets"
"I use different focus modes on my iPhone to have a different Home Screen show up depending on the time of the day, with the right set of reminders showing."
"^^ I do this as well, and will do reminders leading up to the event/task at uncommon intervals like 16 hours before, 3½ hours before, etc."
Same here
"A lot of programs will ask if you want to put a reminder in Google calendar, so I just do it right then and there, and it pops up on my phone so I don't forget"
The act of writing it down also helps to cement it in my brain
"

I also set the clocks in my house to be at least 5-15 minutes fast."
💯
"are you using google calendar or something to have this many reminders?? the calendar app on iphone only has 2 reminder options and i'd kill to have that many, but i haven't been able to get into google calendar"
"> A dentist appointment for example, goes under Misc Appts, and I get reminded one week before, two days before, morning of, and an hour before.


Do you also need the reminder a week before so you can start flossing and don't get called out too harshly when your gums bleed."
I do
But the novelty of a text message vs a push notification coming at me makes it more likely for me to look at the text quicker.
"Oh, I would drive myself crazy doing the weird intervals"
As an audhder it needs te be familiar lol
I tried that trick when I set the clock back for winter time
Not even 2 weeks later my wife is annoyed because the main clock was 3 minutes fast...
"Yes, in Google Calendar you can create multiple calendars and each calendar can have its own default notifications for new events"
"

When you create an event you select which calendar you are adding the event to."
I just put a second appt in with all the same details and different reminder times
"Not ideal always, but it works for now lol"
"I'm using Proton Calendar to do this, but I imagine most calendar applications will let you set up default alerts"
"I get the alerts on both phone and desktop.

[https://proton.me/calendar](https://proton.me/calendar)"
You can get multiple alerts on the iPhone without using Google calendar
"If you use the brilliant Fantastical app, it lets you set more than two alerts.

Fantastical uses the iPhone calendar database, so any events you create using Fantastical will also show up in the builtin Calendar app.

Fantastical is a far more powerful (but potentially more complex) app than the builtin one"
It also has a subscription for some of its more advanced features.
"i honestly feel like the multiple calendars thing in google calendars is what lost me in the first place bc it felt overwhelming, but maybe i can try to use it again if it means i can have different numbers of notifications for things"
thanks!
"oh that's a good idea too!! for the appointments that are a few months out, i'd love to be able to do like 5 reminders to really make sure i remember them, so i might have to try this"
"oh i've never heard of proton, i'll check it out thanks!!!"
thank you!! i didn't know there were so many different calendar options so i'm definitely glad i asked! i will be looking into all of these that everyone has suggested!

"I rarely forget things behind nowadays because I started doing a pat down for everying i have, and leaving everything in one place in somewhere where I'd see it when I leave"
You have to change your routine
Once I started doing a mental checklist before leaving somewhere I very rarely ever ever forget things
I’m going to work
I know I need these things
Food store I know I need these things depending upon where you go
The checklist could be different
It’s the actual process of thinking about things before you leave
Always make sure your water bottle is on the checklist.
My ADHD dad had some insulating bottle sleeves with clips on
"He kept the sleeve clipped to a belt loop, and mostly remembered to put his water bottle back in the sleeve."
That’s exactly what I do
" Of course, there was the time rather recently when I left a plastic water bottle on the roof of my car and drove away….and the recent time when I left my phone on an elliptical machine in the gym until the end of my workout (fortunately no one else had used that machine)…I lost a knee wrap a few weeks ago there as well…I guess I’m not in a good position to give advice here"
Thank you
I think that would solve it
I have to add water bottle to my checklist
"It’s been a long time since I’ve lost phone/keys/wallet, but for some reason water bottle hasn’t clicked yet"
I will try to be more intentional about it.

I got put on propanolol to combat the high HR and ease the physical effects of anxiety & now I am doing alright, however I switched to Adderall recently"

I would suggest telling your doctor how you are feeling because these are more of the serious side effects of Vyvanse"
Maybe they would be able to put you on a medication like propanolol or hydroxyzine (these just lower your heart rate and blood pressure at very low doses) if you choose to stick to Vyvanse

Yep that’s pretty much it
Always feel awkward except with the closest of people
I’m 50 though and don’t know I had audhd until late 40s
So it’s been kind of a mind &@$”
I’ve tried a few anti depressants and stimulants but the downsides always get me to come off of them
Maybe it’s because I was unmedicated for so long already
I’ve actually upped my coffee intake as a stimulant to help and it actually does make a noticeable positive difference in my life
"Other than that, I try be less hard on myself but even that is a challenge after 40+ years of feeling shitty (and thinking shitty things) about myself"
I think just knowing from such a young age will hopefully help you accept yourself in a way that I may never
Good luck! We are all worthy and awesome!
I was unmedicated for the past year and half and thought it was better than medication because of the side effects I would experience and just wanted to do it myself and be better
Every day I was never better and lacked motivation to do anything
Finally went and met with my doctor and got put on Wellbutrin and it has changed my life so far
 Meds work different for people but I highly suggest you try medication to help you out!
I don't bother
"ive taken a slew of different meds, and even beginning, they only end up lasting a few hours"
even with azstarys and vyvanse
I'm sorry it hasn't been working out for you
I've been drinking coffee too however it doesn't seem to have any affect on me
"That's good youre being less hard on yourself, keep it up"
It's not your fault you have have AuDHD
I hope things get better for you
"Thank you for the encouragement, I wish you good luck as well!"
I'm glad you're doing better
"Recently I started working on myself, with my anxiety and all those things that have been holding me back"
"I do feel like medication could help, but I'm not sure if I need it or if I'm able to manage things myself."
I will speak with my doctor about it though.
"Aw man, that's a shame"
Is there anything you've been doing instead to manage your symptoms?
Ahaha.
drinking helps it a lot.

"She’s twelve, and the world’s already trying to turn her into some kind of productivity machine"
Screw that noise
The fact that you’re stepping up to see her as more than just “distracted” is everything
"Whether it’s ADHD or not, what she’s dealing with is real, and you’re doing what most people won’t—actually paying attention to her as a person."
Yep good point
"I skated under the radar my entire childhood and into adulthood because I could do my schoolwork with good grades even with an attention disorder, the only time i became concerned with it was when I was coming up short at work, every place I worked besides retail and food service.

Once my productivity was the focus it became clear that there was something off.

I am more myself when off my medication, goofy and chatty and easily amused, my medication can turn me into a robot depending on what's going on which is very not like me."

Yeah you can fill it
I’ve had 828272 dose/med changes since I just started a few months ago and I’ve had 0 issues
"This happened to me, and my psych had to talk to them to explain the situation, but it turned out okay."
"I changed dosage earlier this year a week after refilling, and had no issue picking up the new prescription nor was I asked to return the old"
"

Having those extra pills helped with that same monthly anxiety leading up to refill day, wondering if it was going to be in stock or not."
Please call your pharmacy
They are the only ones who can answer this question.
"I’ve always been able to fill dose changes right away, have changed plenty of times, and have never had a problem"
I have ADHD & I've had to tell my doctor that I had to took both my Adderall and Xanax like a couple days before the script was ready due to work and family stresses she was fine with it but I wouldn't make a habit of it
Gosh do I feel this.
"but I think I finally got it dialed in, in addition to the vy finally having a generic 🙌🏽"
Did you have to return the old meds for a med change ?
Thanks for the reply
Do you remember if it took longer to refill due to having to clear things with the insurance at all?
No I didn’t have to do that

Meds don't seem to work

when i was first diagnosed i was put on ritalin (methylphenidate)
"i was put on 20mg IR (instant release, meaning i had to take them twice a day)"
"i had a very similar experience to you, it felt like the meds weren’t working at all"
i’m also very hyperactive
"i spoke to my doctor about this, and i was changed to 30mg LA (long acting, one pill a day)"
i still felt minimal difference
"on my next appointment, i spoke to her about it again, and i was put up to 40mg"
"this did work, but i felt as i wasn’t reaching my full potential"
"on my most recent appointment (a month ago), i mentioned this and my doctor put me up to 60mg"
this is working well for me
i definitely recommend going up in dosages! when you first get diagnosed your doctor has to start you on a low dose and you have to work your way up (gradually!) until you reach your perfect dosage
"see how you feel on the 30mg, and if it doesn’t help as much as it should, talk to your doctor about how you’ve felt minimal differences and they’ll most likely suggest a higher dosage"
don’t lose hope!!

Ive done this before… the other commenter saying to go back is right
They can see that you didnt get any gas and will set it up for you again.
lol I can absolutely relate
"Trust me, gas station attendants have dealt with far worse"
A dose of honesty will be appreciated
Go back.
"I'm sure that if you go back and explain, they'd understand!"
"I did it with a drive through bagel, just paid and drove away, oh the embarrassment! Didn’t go back to that place for months…"
I withdrew 80 dollars from the atm once and immediately drive away after I hit the amount I wanted..
the person behind me must have been delighted that day.
I’ve driven off with the pump spigot still in my car - twice.
Last week I paid for lunch at the drive thru then drove away
Ten minutes later I went back and she gave me my food.
I forgot to get gas twice yesterday! Good thing I was still 15 minutes out from the gas station I was driving to
I was literally going there to get gas and “dammit! I was gonna stop for gas! Oh yeah…”
The next thing I’m going to say will sound dismissive but I promise it’s not
"

This type of stuff happens to everyone"
People without ADHD also prepay and then forget
"
Now, with ADHD it happens more often but the strangers you meet don’t know how often it happens to you"
"Why does this matter? 

Because for all they know, this is the first time it’s ever happened to you and it only happened because of stress or something so there is no need to be embarrassed when going back to get it fixed!"
"Man, that sucks"
I’ve paid for and forgotten groceries at the store before.
"That’s okay, I’ve lost 3 gas caps because I would put them in the top of my car while pumping gas and then promptly forget about them."
That’s what we call the ADHD Tax!
I walked away from an ATM after it spit out my card and I was long gone before I realized I didn't wait for the $200
I used to leave cards in ATMs all the time when the $ came out first
Wait prepaid gass
"How does that work? How do you even know how much money you need to fill it up and what if you have money left on it?

I am so confused by this way of getting gas"
"I just filled up my tank today, paid, left and maybe cried a little because I almost paid 2€ a liter."
Once i withdrew 20€ from the ATM and left the money there...happens
Damn....
Your post just made me realize that I did this maybe 5 years ago
"I know I had cash but I spent so long on figuring out the correct amount of gallons that I celebrated by grabbing a drink and the prepaid 7 gallons of calculated gas stayed at the pump.

I also realized that I also took someone's calculated gas because in the middle it started to pump out really really slowly."
I did that one night at a drive thru
I paid and then drove away
I never went back to that Taco Bell
😂
Yup
 I’ve done that
 Fortunately only once for gas
 (Twice at the grocery store.)
"this reminds me of all the times i paid for my food in the first window, and then drove past the second window."
Fuck I have done this exact same thing!!! The gas station was awesome enough to call me (it's a co-op so they have my contact info)
This is why I hate prepaying at gas stations
"If a gas station wants me to prepay, I'll literally go somewhere else"
"Also, I always wash my hands after touching that nasty nozzle lol."
"Me too!

The other day I paid for my food at the drive thru and drove away instead of stopping at the second window"
I’ve done this too many times
The thing is.....society is painfully slow we operate in the speed force so waiting for the cashier to put the money on the pump while you stare at him and wait was a no go for your brain lol everytime I see my doctor omg it's torture she talks slow and repeats alot of the same shit or I already know what ahes saying a couple words in and she feels the need to fully word the question or statement when I understood 20 min ago..ugh
Done it
reminded me of this gas station scene lol [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcqQV1ZoW2g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcqQV1ZoW2g)
Left the engine running after I came home cause I was wearing my headset
"My neighbour went to the gym, came back and said my car was running when she left and when she came home.

It’s hard, but it’s a tax we gotta pay sometimes"
"(The experience I mean,)You walk it off like a hockey player"
Best advice I can give you
Other than trying to get your car filled.
I did this the day after my husband's funeral
"I realized my mistake when I was across the street at a drive-thru, waiting for food, staring at the gas station"
"When I went back, I just told the cashier, ""It's been a rough week."""
lol… don’t feel bad I have done similar if not worse
 For some reason this made me smile because I can relate to the struggle
"After reading your post, I now recall something similar that I did in my early adulthood.


I went out with friends drinking and playing pool or darts at a local night spot"
"I wasn't old enough to drink yet, so I was the DD.  My friend drove and after the night had concluded I was driving him home when he said he needs to get some gas in his car.


We pulled up at the pump at the next gas station, he got out, left the car to pay cash inside and I sat waiting for him to come back.  I think it was fall or winter in southern California, we were in high desert area near the 5 so it can get cold at night during that time.


After paying he came back and start pumping gas, left it on the automatic feed and hopped back in the car to stay warm"
"We started talking and after a few seconds of conversation, I started the car, put it into gear and pulled away from the pump.  Luckily it had a breakaway hose, which I guess is a federal regulation in the US.  Anyways, I stopped after my friend exclaimed at me "" What are you doing!?""


I answered, ""You got back in the car, so I thought it was time to go"
"Crap man, I'm sorry"""
The ADHD subreddit is extremely toxic
"The only opinion you are allowed to have about your own ADHD in that subreddit is that it’s the worst thing that’s ever happened to you, and that medication is a necessary and almost always excellent choice, and that any kind of non-medical coping strategy is just “neurotypical advice” even if it has been empirically demonstrated to be helpful for ADHD"
A lot of “i tried it once and it didn’t work therefore that doesn’t work for ADHD”
"Same vibes as “I exercised once and didn’t lose weight therefore exercise is pointless for me”.

Obviously this is an overgeneralisation, but I find the folks there to be incredibly reactive and intolerant to the slightest suggestion that ADHD can come with strengths as well as weaknesses (even when framed as only my own PERSONAL experience and not a generalisation) or that things like meditation, regular exercise, and using a planner can actually be hugely beneficial if you can successfully form the habit"
Forming habits is fucking hard with ADHD but not impossible
There is a real sense of learned helplessness there which leads to extreme defensiveness against anything that doesn’t align with their worldview.
"Prior to prepay being everywhere, I got gas, went inside to pay"
Decided to get a drink and chips
"I went to the cashier, paid for the drink & chips (forgot about the gas) and walked out"
As I was opening my car door the cashier came running out yelling at me
She was totally justified in doing it but I was so embarrassed.
They may even just return their money anyways
That prepay is returned when you fill up in exchange for the correct amount.
The embarrassment of something like this is far too high to just go back
You have to take the $30 ADHD tax and suck it up.
I once (semi-recently) did this at a McDonalds drive through
"It was embarrassing as heck to explain what happened at the microphone ordering spot, and I think all the teens had a good laugh at my expense."
Been there too
I’ve ran out of gas 3 times this year doing just that
“Oh I’ll get off at the next exit
7 miles later- oh shit I’m completely out of gas!”
It's not ADHD tax
"It's ego tax, because protecting your ego is the sole motivator in refusing to go back"
ADHD tax is things that are unavoidable because of ADHD actions - choosing to not go back is not at all an unavoidable situation.
Needed cash back at the self checkout......left without taking the money smh fml
Some of the old stations don’t take a card and make you go in
The pump won’t turn on until they activate it inside
I hate those ones because they ask how much you want
Like how am I supposed to know? I always just fill it up.
If you’re paying cash you guesstimate and if it fills up for less you go inside and get the change
It’s a C pain in the butt but makes sense why.
"I bought a whole cart of groceries, asked to leave it by the reg while I used the bathroom"
"Washed my hands and walked out, drove home and then realized it"
Luckily I’m not far from the store.
This is why I hate self-checkout lol
"More than once I have scanned my items, bagged them up, and then started to walk away with them before I was reminded that I haven’t paid for them.

But alternatively, at cashier-manned lanes, I’ve paid and then left my groceries behind and the cashier has had to chase me down"
Multiple times.
"Nah, screw that, people do it all the time"
"No reason to be embarrassed, OP should go get their gas or money."
Nope not at all
It isn't a big deal whatsoever and they're not gonna give a fuck
You just go back and do it and realize you aren't the weirdest or most memorable customer they'll have all week.
I've learned to accept myself and not be embarrassed when I screw up
 Only thing that makes me uncomfortable is when people respond poorly to my mistakes without being understanding
But I have to remember that's their problem and their bias and not take things personally.
The ADHD tax is the extra gas you wasted leaving and coming back.
"You can call it protecting my ego, but it’s more like an executive function deficit"
The steps it would take to turn around and go back
Calling work to tell them why I’m late
Explaining the situation to the gas station clerk in HOPES that they understand and it will work out… All things considered it was too much at the time
Way easier to eat the $30 and move on with my life.
Omg same
Never even thought of this as an adhd symptom idk why!
Logically you are 1000% correct.
Accurate
But that's not gonna be $30 worth.
"I was referring to the ""too embarrassed to go back"" part."
I understand where you were coming from originally
"I would be a bit embarrassed too, but I also I worked at a gas station for a bit after high school"
"People have done much more embarrassing stuff, like driving off with the nozzle still in their car"
"

Luckily they have fail closed breakaway connectors in the line, but those were always the most second hand embarrassing ones."
I used to work at a gas station and we've seen genuinely stupid things
Something like this would be just a tad funny to us and I don't think anyone I worked with would have a problem helping them lol
"

I also have bad anxiety and 100% understand not going back tho."

It just seems like such a waste to have that stuff floating around my blood stream all the other hours
When I was on er I used to wake up at 5 or 6 to take pill and go back to bed… maybe that plus afternoon bolster would do the trick
Guess I’ll leave it up to doctor
I just miss my old one so much! Thank you again.

"In my personal experience I was never really nauseous, just more tired and the worst thing was that the medicine didn't do anything noticeable except for the side effects"
Haven't had to vomit once and I don't think its that common if that reliefs some of your fears
Atomoxetine is a really weird drug because it can take months to notice a change and personally I didn't notice anything really
In the first weeks you might be tired and maybe a little emotional but that's it
The biggest problem factor here is your mind and reading stuff that scares you
It's not a stimulant so it isn't nearly as much of a risk factor for most people
"Thanks so much for your reply.

Well, I'm kind of out of options now"
A non stimulant is the next step
I'm happy to take it for months to try and find something that helps
Even if it helps my anxiety a bit (I've read that it can help)
"Yeah, I'm constantly looking for the reassurance and control due to the GAD"
Double edged sword really
"Definitely try it out and give it a chance, there are people who say it works great for them"
"For me Atomoxetine and Methylphenidat both didn't work, I'm taking Vyvanse now and it feels perfect for me"
I don't have a disorder but I am also very anxious and scared of being nauseous so I'm glad that Vyvanse is a drug that is metabolized in the bloodstream and not the stomach
"Ritalin is, and it made me feel sick whenever I didnt eat enough, and then I couldn't eat anything and it made everything even worse"
"With Vyvanse the effect is excaxtly the same Everytime and I can plan my day around it 
Atomoxetine can work for you because it was originally designed as an antidepressant which are supposed to mainly relieve anxiety, just give it enough time but don't be surprised if it does nothing.
Good luck to you!"

"Not taking a paracetamol daily might help if that's the case for you, they do make you tired and Americans tend to have a problematically close relationship with these kind of painkillers"
"Caffeine is a drug just like any other if it wears off there is a minor rebound, if you build up tolerance you need more and a break for one or two weeks can bring back it's effectiveness"
A bit of Exercise or drinking water can also help wake you up
ADHD meds are basically a cheat code for being tired so I'm sorry if these tips are basic because I don't really need them 😅
"If you’re feeling exhausted all the time, my first recommendation is to get checked out by your doctor to make sure nothing medical is going on (thyroid, anemia, etc)"
"If everything is good on the medical side, then the most logical cause is the exhaustion/ burnout that happens when you’re always having to compensate for the ADHD.

If no form of medication is an option, I suggest finding a therapist that specializes in neurodevelopmental disorders to help."
"Thanks, I wish I could take ADHD meds"
"I used to and I loved them but because of other health reasons, I had to stop"
Thanks.

I think it's about perception
" 

For me meditation feels different when I'm on medication, but it's not necessary worse"
" 
It's like watching a painting with sunglasses on or off, the subjective perception is different while what you're doing is the same"
" 

At least that's my experience, is there any other kind of detail that makes it feel 'off'?"
"Do you only notice that while praying, or do other emotional things feel off too?"
How are you praying/religion denomination?
[removed]
What meds do you take? I recently started ritalin and it makes me distant and lack passion towards everything
"When I'm on it, everything is just another chore."
I feel the opposite of it
Without medication I forget to pray even I remember praying I forget how to do it
It is a serious effect
With medication I can schedule my praying.
Most things
"Truthfully, I appreciate this"
I am a VERY empathetic individual and medication allows me to still feel that but not be ruled by it
I can introduce logic into the equation which is honestly necessary
Just a side note!
SSRI
"Ok so to me that sounds like either your medication dose is too high or it’s the wrong medication, or you’re so used to feeling emotions to the extreme that a normal amount seems weird."
An antidepressant? I thought those worsen adhd for a bunch of ppl..
"In any case, it might just be the med not working for u"
Discuss it with ur psychiatrist and they might explore other options.

"My heart rate was already a little elevated, and did get marginally worse when I went on adderall"
"For a bit I was on too high a dose and started having anxiety, I went down but got a bit foggy"
"

Now unrelated to the adhd, I also had a horrible flare up of my psoriasis, a chronic rash most of summer, and increased hair shedding"
"Adderall can increase hair loss, but the other stuff was odd"
I saw a dermatologist and she ordered bloodwork
You know what else increases heart rate? Low iron
You know what is incredibly common with ADHD? Ding ding
"

Low iron also can cause cold fingers and toes (a side effect of adderall, easy to miss), increased hair shedding (again, easy to blame the adderall), fatigue, cognitive impairments, chronic itching skin and irritation, etc etc"
"I’m not saying you definitely have low iron, I am saying discuss non-stimulant options to treat you ADHD and request bloodwork"
"Common issues that mimic / heighten adhd issues and can cause heart issues are low iron/ anemia, thyroid issues, hormone imbalances (think perimenopause / menopause), vitamin D imbalances, just to name a few"
"

It could also be increasing anxiety, but I like to rule out physical, quantifiable possibilities before I dive into psychiatric considerations."
Methylfenidate does increase heartrate like you've most likely have read on the information pamflet provided with your medication
"

So while it is normal for your heartrate to go up I'd recommend just waiting till you can discuss this with the professional that guides you through the medication process"
"

Dont start taking additional medication on the side without consulting with your doctor first incase of substances having a potential reaction."
I had my iron checked last week
"It's gone down from 85 to 61 in the last few months but still within normal range.

I had a cold recently and I started taking ritalin about a week after that and that often elevates my baseline HR for a week or so (I have long covid so that happens)"
So I wonder if my baseline was just too high and the ritain put it way over.
No I'm definitely waiting to see my Dr before taking any more I was just more asking for experiences rather than medical advice :)

"I would always try to eat something before taking meds, even with a non stimulant"
Your brain chemistry is being altered and you brain needs energy to deal with that
Not eating enough is the main reason people feel a sudden crash after taking medication
"If you struggle with hunger in the morning like me, I suggest small snacks like Bananas!, protein bars, nuts or cereal even a little bit helps and drink enough too"
"for me Ritalin was a constant up and down because of the full ness of my stomach, that's why I switched to Vyvanse"

"huh, where i am right now, im going to fail if i don't try

its not like i can just ""do the work"" though"
I was in a very similar situation a couple of years ago
Managed to scrape by but i was feeling horrible
"I think therapy is a great move, other than that i just want to say you're not alone"
Stay strong and remember that it gets better with help from others.
"You need to find the combination of environment and launch which works for you.

Here is what I do for usual work (interesting, complex):

* Calm environment where there are other people around
* Standing desk in afternoons
* Noise cancelling headphones, 180bpm music
* Notes document where I narrate what I'm about to do, what I've done, and what I'm in the middle of when I stop/pause

When the work is less interesting, or I'm struggling with a difficult bit I sometimes need extra tools:

* Pomodoro app (I use 18 minutes on/4 minute break)
* Talk through what I'm doing with someone else
* Interest rewards - I can do this interesting thing in the break if I can stick to the task during the 18 minutes
* Do a crappy/piecemeal/skimmed version first just to get to the end

In class, it may help to sit at the front where there is less in your field of view, doodle while listening to absorb impulses, and retell a summary what you've just been taught into a voice recorder or notepad immediately after the lesson.

Also, I've found cutting out all sugar and sweetener helps, and drinking black coffee"
"Sometimes fasting until mid afternoon, but listen to your body on that one and drink enough water."
"I (m22) also thought about dropping out and taking a GED test around your age (God I feel so fucking old saying that, basically one footnin the grave already lol) and I'm glad I didn't"
my parents told me I won't get the same treatment as someone with a HS diploma and I should stick it out since its the easiest time to do it
"could totally be something else but this sounds pretty textbook and sounds similar to a lot of my experiences (been diagnosed at least a decade now), including the horrible burnout and it's easiest to get diagnosed if you're not an adult"
I'd bring it up to your parents or your doctor alone if you think your family would give you pushback
meds aren't a universal solution but they help a lot of people
"even without that, being able to recognize adhd and talking to a specialist about it could help as well"
It usually never hurts to understand more hoe your mind works
"

Maybe the worst for me in High School was I had a semester-long film class I got a B or a C on a film class I took"
I did all the worksheets and participated in class and the homework as watching a movie every 1 or 2 weeks and I was only able to do it ONCE
Hopefully it makes you feel at least a bit better knowing there are lots of other people who have experienced the same thing as you and there probably are people in your school (depending on the size) who are going through the same thing as well
it's definitely not the end of the world and you should be able to make it through this
"

your family sounds very unhelpful and I'm sorry about that, shaming you isn't okay and even if you did get your GED you still can have a happy life, it'll just be a bit harder for you"
if you're burnt out I'd highly recommend taking a break after HS but don't let that turn into not going to college like it did for me
"try not to stress about it too much, aside from Harvard or other super prestigious universities, no one will care about your high school transcript."
Get a note pad and write two circles within each other
"Draw a tiny circle right in the middle and label it ""me"".

The first circle is the circle of influence"
That's all the things you can control
"Write down all the issues and problems you have that you can do better with: writing notes, remembering what assignments you have etc.

The second is the circle of concern"
It's going to be bigger by design
"Write all the things that you can't influence - subjects you dislike, teachers who are shitty etc.

Then look at the first circle - make a list of things you can do to handle what's in there"
"

Review the second circle and make peace with it.

Now every day make notes in a note pad of things you have to do"
You can do this on s weekly basis
If you need to re-listen to lectures or whatever knock it on the list
When you've completed it cross it out
"

You'll find you make progress when you identify what your issues are and what you're doing to solve them."
Are you medicated because the answer is probably drugs
" I see you’re doing therapy, which can help (although only CBT has been shown to work)"
But the general advice is medication first.
"Talk to your family doctor, explain it like you did here"
Hell have them read this post
"ADHD is best understood not as the inability to pay attention, it is the inability to choose what you pay attention to, or lock in as you call it. 




My personal experience is that I am unable to not give it 100%, so when I am told it isn't good enough I am like: this is all I have, I can't go any harder"
This is all of it.
Who is telling you that you are going to be a disappointment?
pretty much
What have you tried and what success have you found?
honestly might be the move
i just started therapy again on monday so i'll see if there's anything she can do.
my own mother lol
constantly.
"When was the last time you took a break and took a step back from things?

ADHD burnout is never a good experience"
"

Your brain is just like nope not today."
so we both know it sucks
"im not joking when i say ive tried everything, all expect the meds"
"Good luck, remember to try not to put a happier face on"
"If you mask and don't appear so bad, they may not see past that. 


Be honest with how much you are struggling and shit"
"You aren't there to impress them, they are there to take care of YOU."
That sucks.
"might not be good advice but my parents were pretty disappointed in me throughout my time in education, I found it easier to pretend like everything was more or less going okay until I eventually ended up retaking a year or dropping out of uni or whatever"
Kept my parents disappointment limited to short bursts instead of constant reminders which I are harder to ignore
If your mum wants to constantly remind you that she thinks you’re a disappointment then she maybe doesn’t deserve consistent truthful updates on how you are doing.
I found I had to combine a lot of things together for it to work
"Not saying it would work for you, but perhaps to expect that it may take a combination.

If meds are the right answer for you, hope it gets worked out quickly for you."
"it hasn't worked since elemetary

its not about to work now

honestly though, meds might the the answer"
They probably are to be honest
ADHD meds are some of the most effective treatments for any disorder out there
Vyvanse also was the only thing that significantly improved my depression and I've tried over half a dozen meds for that.

Vyvanse - when will you know?

For me it takes almost three hours to work
Then only lasts like an hour or two
Idk not my favorite
I’d be curious what others think
You should mention this to your doctor in case you haven't
30mg is the starting dose and it hit me pretty strong at first
"I recently upped to 50mg and it gets me pretty high around 1-2 hours after taking it and lasts for several hours then, mostly after lunch and a quick post lunch crash it goes to the second stage where I am more calm"
The initial high mainly energizes me to an insane degree
"I don't tend to be as forgetful and clumsy but I wouldn't say it relieves all ADHD symptoms it even makes some of them worse, like for example I become incredibly impatient and emotional.

Vyvanse is a pro drug meaning it is instantly metabolized and the slow release works through enzymes in your bloodstream turning it into the wonderstuff"
Every body and every brain works different and you wouldn't believe how different
"If you're a large person 30mg obviously is less effective than for a 60kg person like me.
Edit: Just read that you have a male fiance so assuming you're an average hetero woman you shouldn't be that much heavier"
Vyvanse is known for having a smoother peak than most substances but generally it sounds a bit weird that you don't have an initial high
It's common that most peopme have a medication they don't respond to at all or in weird ways so maybe it's just not your type of medication
"That doesn't sound right at all, Vyvanse is supposed to last up to 14 hours"
Obviously the last 7 hours aren't as intense as the first 7 but Vyvanse does not last only two hours
Either your dose is way too low or you're body is not made for this drug
I haven’t felt high at all
"My eyes are a little dilated, but no high, no energy boost, and no crash"
"I certainly don’t expect it to take all my symptoms away, but I thought surely I’d get more than I have so far"
"

Yes, I’m 5’7 and 133 pounds (60kg) - you were right on the nail! I’ve had this issue with so many medications"
I’ve been on 28 different SSRI/SNRI/mood stabilizer/etc
"medications throughout the years before I learned of this diagnosis with my new psychiatrist, and they either did nothing or gave me really horrible side effects"
"It’s frustrating! 

I did elect for Vyvanse over Adderall *because* I wanted the smoother onset/offset, but dang!! I have my follow up with my psychiatrist in two weeks, so I’ll discuss this with him then!

Thanks so much for talking with me!!"
"28 different medications? Wow you're obviously more experienced with this stuff than I am, I hope you find something that works! In my country aside from Vyvanse the only two options for ADHD are Ritalin and Atomoxetine, both didn't work and gave me a really bad time, luckily Vyvanse works mostly"
"
I'm not a doctor and I don't know what your prior diagnosis was, that you had so many different stimulants, but I am pretty sure taking so many different meds will have some effect on your brain chemistry in the long term, maybe 50mg is just not enough or you need to let your brain catch a break and try a more therapy centered approach"
"But your doctor hopefully knows better about that stuff, just be honest with them and good luck to you!"

How to cope with employment? ADHD friendly jobs?

Smaller family owned/mom-and-pop types of places are usually more forgiving of ADHD symptoms like forgetfulness and time-blindness
"That can be a bit of a double-edged sword because for some people(like me) the lack of structure involved with them can feel like they encourage your symptoms.

They can be a bit harder to find and don't pay super well compared to corporate jobs"
They rarely advertise that they're hiring or have listings on job boards
"They're basically the only types of businesses that still use the ""boomer method"" of going door to door, speaking to the owner, and handing them a resume"
"So if you feel like your applications are constantly being autorejected from other jobs, you may have better luck getting a job that way.

You could also try farm work if you live near the countryside, but it can be even harder finding someone who wants help on farms😅"
"Flight attendant!! It’s very fun, easy, you get to meet and talk to new people everyday and get the explore some of the coolest places"
It’s also a great career to get into in your 20’s as seniority is everything in this field.
"I've come to realise I thrive when I have a fast paced environment, ownership over HOW I get my work done, independence (i.e no manager talking shit about how I dress, how I sent this email or whatever), and of course a lot of interest in what I'm doing.

I'm a project manager and while my anxiety is usually spiking every day at some point I feel fulfilled and love the challenge."
What are your interests?
I was 19 living with my parents
Depressed
"

I started writing down my likes and dislikes, my strengths and weaknesses, and my dream/goals in life.

I am 50+ now and I am glad to see that I have achieved most of my goals in life"
"And all started by writing down when I was 19.

First, define your likes and dislikes; what are you good at and enjoy doing.

If you hate something, you will not survive doing it for any amount of money"
"

Second, what strengths do you have? Ability, interest, language, skills and education, experience - this part you can develop along the way"
You can always learn a new language or get a skill you need as well as an education
"But I suggest building up on your abilities and interests.

Third, goals: what will be your goal for the next year, five years and ten years"
 And in twenty and thirty years
I am not joking
"I knew when I was writing,  I want to get married, work in hollywood, and in media, live in a rural area close to beaches, travel the world, and be free (e.g"
work at home not in a building or in corporate world)
I hate working 9 to 5 but do not mind working late hours or at the weekends as long as I arrange my own schedule
"

Although I wanted to get in media, I knew my freedom meant a lot so being famous and getting attention was not for me"
"So, I stayed behind the camera jobs from the start"
" 

Dreams will turn into targets when you write down and start taking even one tiny step towards them"
"

Do not despair, you are too young"
Life is an amazing journey
Enjoy it.
Can totally relate
So many work environments are not Adhd friendly.
"This is just my perspective, but every time I’ve tried to ask stuff like this or taken suggestions from other people, I end up in jobs that are actually a poor fit"
We aren’t a monolith and our symptoms can be experienced in so many different ways
"

I know people with ADHD who absolutely love fast-paced work with as little down time as possible"
That type of work has never fit well with me
I need very little structure and lots of room to be creative
"

The thing I see more consistently is that we struggle to engage with things we aren’t truly interested in"
I’d look into your areas of interest and see about ways to make those fit into a career
"I know that’s easier said than done sometimes, but I think we thrive more when we focus on what works for us as individuals rather than trying to approach it like a formula that works the same way for everyone."
"In my experience, a kitchen can be a pretty good place to work with inattentive ADHD, assuming you can find one that doesn’t have toxic management (so you’d want to avoid any chain - corporate sucks - and stick to small local businesses who actually want to treat and pay their people better).

Most of what kitchen work consists of is small, short tasks, you just do a lot of them when it’s busy"
"It can be easy to stay organized because you’d have all the tickets on the docket to refer back to, you don’t have to put on a face for customers because it’s back of house, and so on.

The big problem with kitchens and food service in general is the hours"
"You’d need to be ok with working weekend evenings, and if you aren’t a morning person it sucks to not have work as a reason to get out of bed early."
"Operation manager, or any job where you can hyperfocus on datasheets"
I work in a creative field
"Yes, they’re hard to get into - so hard that it took over a decade to get to where I’m actually “comfortably” employed"
"But I knew early on, years before the ADHD diagnosis, that it was the only way I wouldn’t be absolutely miserable"
"Like even as a kid, just the thought of any normal “business office”, or “blue collar” job, was mortifying"
I didn’t even understand why at the time
I just “knew” I HAD to do something where my mind was actually being “entertained” because my life might literally depend on it
"

To be clear, I’m not suggesting that someone with ADHD couldn’t be happy as a plumber etc., but for the specific way I had learned to cope with unmedicated ADHD (like constantly drawing in class), I knew I had to do something that wasn’t typical"
"So I basically put 90% of my life efforts into making that happen, often at the expense of having normal friendships and relationships"
"

Had I been treated earlier, it’s possible I would have been fine doing more menial work, and that it wouldn’t have been the terrifying nightmare I imagined it to be, but you work with what you got and what I had at the time was a brain that was desperately screaming at me to do everything in my capacity to work in a creative field"
So I did.
"I personally am getting into being a truck driver, I enjoy going places and seeing things, and I get to be in my own little world inside my truck, it's also a job where you do exactly one thing and nothing else, you drive from A-B and that is it"
In my experience it's all about interest
Interest = motivation
"What do you like to do? Do you like to work with people? Do you have any hobbies? Would you like a job where you are physically active or could you sit in front of a computer? How are your chances for getting education? You have to find out about these things, and more before you decide"
"And also, you are young, don't stress about it"
Think of it as a way of making money until you find your path
"I worked for 5 years at a job I found rather boring, then got 2 kids and became a nurse"
"I freaking love my job and couldn't have done anything else, but I was not ready for that when I was 20"
"Don't put so much pressure on yourself, you have many many years left working"
If you find out about it when you're 30 you still have 3/4 of your working years left
"But don't quit your job, not going to work is the root of all bad things in my opinion"
"You might get social anxiety, and you might get into a pattern that's not easy to get out of"
Best of luck! 🫶
Earlier this year I made a career change from nursing in a busy (chaotic) hospital to a 9-5 desk job
Huge mistake
In fact it’s what led to my recent ADHD diagnosis
"

I really struggle to sit in one spot at day staring at a computer screen"
"My previous job had a lot of variety, I was constantly moving and flitting between one task and another"
"My ADHD never hindered me, in fact looking back I think it was an asset in that environment"
"

Now in my new role I have to be jacked up on amphetamines and have a bunch of workplace modifications in place just to be able to do the basic functions of my job.

So I’d suggest things like nursing, care work, child care, hospitality, etc"
Anything where you’re not bogged down doing one task for too long and where you can keep a bit of momentum going.
I find that physical jobs keep me better focused than any desk job.
"For better or worse, I picked the hospitality trade all those years ago cos I couldn't just do it.."
*I could do it well*! Lots of short-term tasks with no option of procrastination..
"And I've always been more comfortable around folk that have a drink in them - it evens the 'living in the moment' playing field, imho.."
"Granted, my 'bad days' were still pretty damn rough tho.

I only discovered the inattentive side of ADHD  a few years ago at 40yo"
Now diagnosed and waiting for titration but I have no regrets about my career choice.
"So, I know you said no high pressure or stressful, but business is booming in Emergency Management so it’s not super competitive or over saturated (yet), it’s paid super well, and there are various of training programs to get your started"
"The ADHD mind lends well to emergency management because every day looks different, every disaster or event is different, there’s lots of coordination and talking to people, travel, and best of all, you’re HELPING people"
I found my way in here and it’s honestly been a lifesaver
"During covid when everyone lost their jobs, I had 10 jobs offers and doubled my salary and got 2 promotions within a year"
"If you like learning something new, there’s always improvements to be made"
"And finally, yes, some areas can be stressful (disaster response), but areas like disaster recovery, mitigation, and preparedness are much slower paced with lots of options to work remote, in an office, or travel onsite"
"

Just a thought bc not many people know about it yet! And it’s a great career"
Good luck 🩵
Honestly? It very much will depend on your interests and background
Even a “good” field or position will also heavily depend on your work place environment
"

With that being said, I enjoy more data driven and computer application driven jobs."
The worst part if have to deal with is the anxiety
Am
"I good enough at my job? I have so much to do.

Why don't I have any work to do now? Did I forget something?

Should I interact with people or they might think I'm weird AF?

Oddly it's easier at the start cos there is new stuff to learn but suddenly it's just.."
Bleh boring routine.
A good starting point is to find something that won’t have you sitting at a desk the entire shift
It’s good to be up and moving and physically grounding yourself by using your body
"

If you’re in the US you’ve got 5 or 6 years left to be on your parent’s health insurance, but after that point you’ll need a job that offers health insurance or you’ll have to go without or go with an extremely expensive plan both of which are unacceptable"
If you’re living at home I’d go to school or seek a certification of some sort that will help you achieve something closer to a living wage
"

Once you need a job that gives health insurance it may have weird hours and shit pay but the insurance may be so essential that you feel trapped and it could make it feel impossible to do an inflexible school program or limited certification classes"
Take advantage of this very important window in your life
Go shadow careers
Go to college job fairs
"Ask questions about day to day workflow.

I cannot stress enough how important your living situation and age is to your personal development"
You have no idea what the future holds and you may not have this opportunity 5 years from now
Don’t tie yourself down to debt or that will trap you as well
If you go to school or do a certification look for what’s in demand now
Don’t go for a degree go for a career
Talk to people in those “in demand” fields and get their opinion on it being labeled “in demand” or if that’s old news
Ask what they would do if they could do it all over again
They may reveal a path they hadn’t considered but would have been better now that they’re older and wiser
Being a researcher is nice for me
"But not the experimental kind, working with data on a question Im vaguely interested in"
"Its fast-paced, lots to do, little down time to stimulate me out of executive dysfunction but enough flexibility to skip times when Im a mess"
"Hard for sure, still working things out, but overall good! Crucial to find a supervisor who isn't an insane overachiever"
"You have a roof over your head, you have parents that care & a job"
"Congrats!


You don't like your current job so you have the opportunity to try something new"
"Lucky you!

I'm in my 30s looking to switch jobs.
I might fail you might fail but either way we will learn"
Unless you're working in a dangerous job there's nothing to be terrified of.
"You have a roof over your head, you have parents that care & a job"
"Congrats!


You don't like your current job so you have the opportunity to try something new"
"Lucky you!

I'm in my 30s in not that much better shape"
"


I might fail you might fail but either way we will learn"
Unless you're working in a dangerous job there's nothing to be terrified of.
Do you need a degree though?
do you work in film/ tv?
"It depends on the workers, because they love to shit talk about you, because I work with good management but the workers are assholes, who like to talk bad behind everyone's back even if the other person doesn't impact your job"
And the low pay.
This is a bit different but essentially the same thing but on a much but fir companies if you find the ppl element a bit much
"It's also a niche role but Buisness Continuity,  Disaster Recovery, Incident Management (you may see these referred to a BC, DR, IM).

But basically it helping a buisness manage thing and plan for things going wrong"
"This can be everything from big things eg a flood or system downtime, to small things eg a sub office can't get in because they've lost a key"
Theyres lots of variety and also urgency as things need to  fixed
"

These are 3 seperate but overlapping roles so you may see this advertising one thing up to all 3"
Though you should be aware that due to the fact that this is a specialist area it tends to be large companies that offer this sort of role.
Nope
Just highlight your customer service experience and be safety oriented
Also true
"Yeah unfortunately a lot of kitchens don’t pay great, that’s one of the reasons to avoid anything corporate"
I should have added
 Go FoH for bartending
" Higher paying, don’t need to be organized"
 Can be super social.
"In my time in foodservice I really wanted to do that but never got the chance, so I didn’t want to suggest it given my lack of firsthand experience"
"That being said, I agree on the condition that the social aspect is wanted"

probably just helps you relax
I'm sorry but this is such a funny question 😂
I don't think it's necessarily the sauna but just the fact that Saunas are supposed to relax you? It's healthy so why not 😅
Yeah I know lol but there is something magical about it for me
Does way more than medication
"True relaxation is powerful, I notice it when once every few months I become extremely responsive to ASMR"
Most of the time it doesn't work for me but sometimes I get tingles all over my body and afterwards I feel so relaxed without being sleepy and it lasts for hours sometimes
I believe most of the hype about meditation comes from the relaxation and Sauna or bathing is basically the same aside from the physical effects sweating has on the body
Interesting! For me a sauna has very similar effects to running so could be the relaxing effect

"Are you taking IR or XR? XR at 10mg for me only lasted about 5 hours, and that was when I first started medication"
"To avoid the slump near the end of your work day, you could talk to your doctor about upping your dosage"
"If you are on IR, then you can either switch to XR so it lasts longer, or try a booster like you were thinking"
"

Either way, you should definitely talk to your doctor about these problems, they’ll help you out and get you taken care of."
It's XR
"I guess after many months now, my body is probably used to 10mg"
But that's scary
At what point do you stop upping your dose? Lol
This is why sometimes I take medication breaks just to reset my system
"But I've noticed if I go 4 days without it, next week I'll have a much worse response time, cos now there's no residual of that medication at all in my system."
And yeah I meet with my psychiatrist monthly
I guess every two months now that I've been on it for quite a long time.
"Well, you can’t get anything higher than 30mg in one dose, at least in America, so that answers your upping dose question"
"40mg is typically the cut off, I know people that take 30mg XR with a 10mg IR booster but they have such more severe symptoms than me"
You’re most likely adjusting to the medication and getting used to it
"Now that doesn’t necessarily mean that it isn’t effective, you just can’t perceive it the same way you used to"
"If you’re still getting your work done etc, then your only real problem seems to be the duration it’s lasting now"
So I think you’re on the right path about what you’re gonna talk to your doctor about
I take 20mg XR right when I wake up and that takes care of me for the day
"What you could do is not increase your dosage on the XR, take it in the morning when you wake up like you’re planning, and get a 5mg IR booster to push that slump closer to your bed time so it doesn’t interfere with your day to day"
Good point
I'll talk to my doc about adding a 5mg IR and not XR
Also does it matter that I take cvs brand generic ones? My insurance covers generic at a much better price than brand name Adderall
Like it's 9$ a bottle for generic for a month vs 40 or 50 for brand name
Name brand vs generic effectiveness really changes from person to person
"One person will preach name brand is the only way to go, while another person will shout that they’re the exact same thing"
It’s subjective based on YOUR experience
My insurance covers the name brand stuff completely
"If I had to go out of pocket for my medicine, I’d definitely be on the generic brand"
"From the sounds of it, you’re doing great on the generic ones"
I’d try to tweak your current dosage of the generics before jumping to name brand
"If all else fails, then maybe name brands for you, or maybe even a completely different medication in all"
But I’d stick to what you got for now.
Thanks
I appreciate your response.

Definitely worth mentioning to your doctor
"My partner, her Dr"
had her buy a heart monitor for blood pressure and heart rate when we were trying out different stimulants
"

She was often between 70-100, and when we checked with the doctor they said it seemed reasonable"
"Unfortunately, with heart rates and pressure, it seems like something pretty conditional to the patient, so as always, best to talk to your doctor about your specific situation"
"

That being said, I would say regularly & consistently over 100 is what would raise an eyebrow for me"
As would “never under 90”
"If either of those are the case, probably talk to your doctor soon- otherwise, just bring it up with your psychiatrist"
"

Disclaimer: I am not a doctor, this is not medical advice."
"Do you take other stimulants such as coffee, nicotine, tea, or soda? If so, what may have been a normal amount to you before taking your medication?

"Last week, I had an appointment that was supposed to be in-person that got switched to virtual"
She told me I don’t have ADHD and just have depression and anxiety
"

I had an in-person appointment elsewhere to get a second opinion on Monday, and he told me he knew I had ADHD within the first 10 minutes of me sitting in his room"
"

I think this speaks volumes and leads me to believe that it’s important for the assessor to be able to see you in person - your body language, your movement, etc., all are important factors in being assessed properly in my opinion."
Virtual assessments can be just as effective as long as the person doing the assessment knows what they’re doing
In the same way that an in person assessment can be completely useless if done by someone who doesn’t actually have the competence to evaluate for ADHD
"Sadly though, a lot of the “virtual ADHD evaluation clinics” are just diagnosis mills and are extremely unethical"
Basically scams
"It can be hard to tell which one is which :\

I would look for a licensed clinical or neuropsychologist who specializes in neurodevelopmental disorders/ assessments"
Biggest red flags to look out for: if they diagnose based off of only a couple questionnaires and only evaluate for ADHD (don’t go through the differential diagnosis process).
I wouldn't go there expecting to get a medication
"You will have to fill out tests first, come again a few weeks later and if they turn out positive your doctor will discuss the options"
"If you say you've come to get a certain med, it's likely they think you just want to sell them"
"If they ask you what kind of therapeutical approach you want to take, say you want to try medication and that You've read about these two online"
"

ADHD tests can be very unscientific and Doctors too regarding this topic, especially when you say ADHD is not recognized in the UK"
"Just answer the questions truthfully, maybe try to not sugercoat things because this almost resulted in me not being diagnosed since my symptoms were apparently ""barely strong enough for a diagnosis"""
"
Maybe you'll find out you have something other than ADHD, maybe you have ADHD, maybe you need to go to another doctor or even a 3rd one to get a diagnosis, just be honest to them and yourself"
The main reason you're going is to be prescribed dexedrine? Sounds like you're just trying to get access to drugs to abuse...
Thank you so much for expressing
"If it's not private, how did you manage?"
No ? I often hear of the different drugs as a band-aid for the mental health and life overall and that raw dogging life in society with adhd is quite hard
He is maybe convinced he has adhd and expect to already be taking the medication
He is young and maybe in a environment of excessive study and the struggle is really noticeable
Only after the assessment will he gets his answer.
That seems pretty judgmental
I also sought a diagnosis so I could get medication
There’s not much material benefit to having a formal diagnosis otherwise
And the medication has been really helpful since I do in fact have ADHD.
"I went all my life without any medication and have tried everything, yes I want access to drugs, not to abuse"
"I want to live a normal life, where I don't forget simple tasks, and where I don't fail in simple academic procedures."
Sure! I’m an open book
Could you elaborate on what you mean by how I managed?
"I am diagnosed, my diagnosis is also translated to English, I am just striving to get Elvanse and Dexedrine"
I'm saying that you can't walk in there and specifically say you want dexedrine
That's going to set off alarm bells.
Okay that's fair - I would just say be really cautious when talking to your psych
They will be wary if you do in there looking for specific drugs when those drugs can be abused
"What solutions has the doctor offered than medication?  
I am fearing that if I attend the assessment online that I won't be diagnosed the Dexederine and Elvanse that I want."
Thank you for your warning
"Maybe it's because English isn't my first language, that's why I might come off the way I am"
Forgive me.
"Oh ok! By the way, I am in the US"
All that he is able to offer is medication management since he is a psychiatrist
"I told him I was uninterested in Adderall for right now, and did not want to start off with Straterra, so he put me on Vyvanse, which is what I was hoping for"
"

A psychiatrist might suggest you seek therapy with a psychologist/therapist/counselor"
"Psychiatrists (in the US, at least) very rarely spend time talking with you about how to get better outside the use of medications"
It does sometimes bode well for you if you do have a therapist - it shows that you are putting in the leg work to try and develop coping mechanisms and skills to improve the way you handle yourself.

Thanks for sharing
Great Job on your sobriety - I was unofficially suggested I had ADHD by my Psychologist a couple years ago at age 50 and like you went back through my life and it all made sense once I learned about it
"Also like you, 24 years ago I was drinking a lot and decided enough so quite"
Shortly after that is when i had my first panic attack and was prescribed anti depressants
And like you I do not talk to anybody about it because of the stigma.
Always looking for new ideas

U are taking about the same dosage of vyvanse
Maybe even a lil stronger
"But if I were u, I would go up to 50mg"
Why the 50 for mydayis? Honestly the 40mg of Vyvanse felt slightly too low as well haha so I could have probably been on 50mg of Vyvanse.
Because mydayis is divided into 3 doses and u will feel it more
I take adderall xr
Have you tried mydayis before?
No but I have researched it
I know it’s weaker than my adderall xr
Interesting
Yeah I feel it kind of giving me some energy but i also just feel my usual bad executive dysfunction and scatterbrained self
"I really hope this med will work for me, I’m hoping it’s just that the dose is too low"
I am also ovulating so maybe that has something to do with feeling kind of blah
Yes that definitely has something to do with it
Is it normal to get extremely tired and fatigued about 4-5 hours after taking mydayis?

"This is an internal version of when my parents said ""You want to be DEPENDENT on a PILL that people get ADDICTED to!?""

Yes"
The answer is yes
"

""Oh no I lost both legs! At least I have my trusty wheelchai-"" ""YOU'RE GONNA DEPEND ON A WHEELCHAIR YOUR WHOLE LIFE, HUH? SHACKLED TO THE WHEELS!?!?"""
"Why is the brain the only organ we do this to ourselves about??

If you needed a pill every day to keep your heart functioning properly, would you beat yourself up about being dependant upon it as well?"
I’ve been taking Adderall (pretty much) daily for 3 or 4 years
I now can even have a lower dose because I found that after 2 years on it I learnt the skills I have and capabilities whilist on it
"So days I don’t take it or forget are still productive! Just my mood isn’t great so it helps with that mainly but my point is that whilist it sucks to feel dependent on it, think about the present and don’t dwell on the medication being something you’ll might use everyday"
"Been on it almost the same amount of time, same dose too"
I feel what you’re saying
"If you are working with a counselor or therapist, as I am, this could be something to discuss, as well as with your doctor.

FWIW, in my experience the days off are “worse” than “before”, with a lot of the same symptoms you describe"
"I just plan for it, and communicate it with my loved ones"
"

I’ll also say that I’ve been trying to think of my medication the way my spouse thinks about her eyeglasses - there’s no amount of wearing glasses that will “fix” her eyes, and while it’s true that she is dependent on them to see, as long as she remembers to wear them, they’re incidental to her life - they don’t define her life."
"This is common.

I’ve been on adderall for 20 years"
I hate it
The side effects are gross
It makes me irritable
It dulls my creativity and my emotions
But I need it
It lets me be who I need to be
"I take tolerance breaks and try out new meds on occasion, but I always come back to what works despite the negatives"
"

My advice as an internet stranger is to journal about it.

Write down all the pros and cons that come from the meds"
Write when you’re fully on the meds (an hour or two after taking them) and while totally off them (on a day where you haven’t taken them)
"Write down what “dependency” means for you and what you’re getting from it and what you’re giving up in exchange.

You’ve already started that conversation for yourself in the first paragraph of your post"
"Try to expand that thought as much as you can for yourself.

Goal is to understand what you’re doing by using medication"
"And to feel comfortable with your decisions, whatever they are"
And to give yourself a snapshot that you can refer back to whenever you feel the need to revisit the question
"See if things have changed over time.

Post back what you learn."
"I have to use an inhaler daily to control my asthma, in the same way I take a pill every day to modulate my ADHD.


I make no distinction between the standing of either medicine and neither should you."
I'd rather be dependent on a pill than go back to who I used to be
ADHD is a life long invisible disability and your meds  are a treatment for that
"It's normal to be stressed and fatigued when faced with the fact that treatments make such a huge difference and may be needed indefinitely, but that's just how it is.

Adhd is a chemical issue that you can not will your way out of"
"You can absolutely learn to live with it and create systems that help you function, but it's not going away"
"

Stimulants are for ADHD what mobilty aids are for people with a physical disability and no one expects them to just give up the things that help them live productively just because they may always need them."
"Vyvanae turns me into a “ productive robot “ which during the week , I enjoy"
"Im aware that it is still me , but I function on the things I would otherwise just be procrastinating about"
"Right on queue , I can feel “‘myself” return , like my mind is telling me it’s done its job and I can now go back to the relaxed person I am.

The pill doesn’t make you a better person , it just allows us to keep up with the easy over stimulation the world has to offer now as opposed to a world we would generally thrive in unmediacated.

I take vyvananse Monday to Friday."
on weekends I usually stick to my dex or nothing at all.
the medication doesn’t not change who you are.
Let me rephrase it this way
"

You have a permanent chemical imbalance in one of your organs"
They’ve developed a medication that allows you to live practically normal with that imbalance
"

Your brain is no different from any organ"
Don’t feel bad for taking medication to treat an issue with it
Sending you love
🫶🏻
I always have pills for 2 days in my purse in case a forget to take them before I leave for school
"You don’t need to stop taking them, it’s your decision"
"Lots of people take medication, my father who is diabetic would literally die without insulin, this isn’t any different."
"I have noticed after two years of taking my adhd meds regularly that in the periods where im sick or broke and cant afford them, I have built much better skills using those medications"
"

These skills are harder to use and more exhausting without my medication, but the fact is I used a tool to learn a technique, and I personally learned that technique, not the medication"
"

Whether you will be on this for all life is not decided"
"And I grieve for my heart and body that thos is the trade off sometimes, but mostly I am so appreciative"
"Like its hard on my heart, but with adhd meds I am able to go for a run three times a week, and when I dont have the meds on me its still great cardio i did.

You're going to be okay"
I'm so happy for you that you found a tool that works.
I’m ‘addicted to/ dependent on’ my glasses.
but only bc I like to see well 🤷🏽‍♀️
When our brains can't make the proper bain chemicals to help us do the things we need to do STORE BOUGHT IS FINE.
ADHD is a disability and EVERYONE needs to be on medication to feel normal
Our brains are different than everyone else
So what if you have to swallow a pill every morning to make your day “normal”
I’d give anything to feel that
I’m still trying to figure out my med dose
 Just take it and be happy
Maybe see a therapist too and talk about it.
"First off, it's awesome that the meds are helping you! That's great!

Second, six months is a really short time in the scheme of things"
As time goes on you will learn different skills and habits than you had before the meds
"

I was on meds for 8 years when I decided to quit due to side effects and I haven't been on them since"
"They helped me a lot, but I felt like I'd learned what I needed to learn from them and was really struggling with the appetite suppression"
"15 years later I stand by both of those choices, to take meds and then to stop taking them.

Medications are a tool"
"It's your body, it's up to you which tools you want to use"
As long as the benefits are so good I think you should keep taking them and not worry
If later you feel like it's not helping as much you can always change your mind then.
Okay but you're stressed and over tired which also affect concentration
"

You need to get yourself focused on routine of eating somewhat well and sleeping at a decent hour to give yourself the best chance of focusing on the day,  meds or no meds."
"You wouldn’t say this to someone with spectacles, would you? You wouldn’t tell someone with a broken leg not to use a crutch because they might get dependent on it? You wouldn’t tell someone with diabetes that they’re weak for using insulin.

So what’s different about you?

The meds aren’t a crutch"
You’re not dependent on them
They’re an aid to allow you to function like everyone else
"They’re no different than a wheelchair or an insulin pump or a hearing aid or an inhaler.

Why don’t you think you’re worthy of that support?"
"I only recently got on adhd meds (not vyvanse) and because my dose got adjusted, I ran out for a few days (it’s one that’s ok to miss doses of without risk of withdrawal) and had been thinking “nah I don’t think the meds are doing much.” But on day one of not having them I had the “OH MY GOD THEY DID SO MUCH” moment and started to get the same worry about “am I really tied to this for the rest of my life?” 

But as others have said, it’s an accommodation that helps a disability"
"I’m not addicted, and I have to remind myself of that sometimes"
"They help make my life easier and it’s currently accessible to me, so why wouldn’t I use it? The meds aren’t making me h*gh/buzzed or anything, just making my brain actually able to focus for the first time in 27 years"
"

Be easier on yourself, and try to think of meds as a tool or accommodation."
I don’t think you have quite grasped your disorder yet.
"I second the general sentiments here and would like to add that your symptoms and circumstances are also going to change over time, which means your need and relationship with the meds will as well"
"That feeling of “is this gonna be forever?” … the answer is no! Like, you’re not gonna be in uni forever"
Some jobs may cause you to need more support for your symptoms than others
Etc
"

When I have big changes in my life I almost always follow with a change in dose or even a med break a couple months later.

If the pills make your life better now, keep taking them! And remember that “now” isn’t how it’s always gonna be!"
"I mean if a pill every day allows me to be the person I want to be and to live my best life, wouldn't it be kind of silly to NOT take it?"
"If it’s medicine that we need to function, I’m failing to see the downside"
A diabetic wouldn’t stop taking insulin (I hope not at least).
"The great news is, you actually don’t have to stop taking it! I’ve been on stimulant meds since I was a teenager and am now pushing 40 and thriving while still taking stimulant meds"
I have a great family and a career I love and no worries about using medicine that makes those things possible.
But sometimes it just is what it is
The ADHD isn’t going away
Ever
"If you want to function more ‘normally’, you just gotta do it.

I’m deaf"
I have to wear a hearing aid every day for the rest of my life to function better
It’s okay
🤷‍♀️
I depend on my medication to function the same way I depend on my glasses to see
There’s no shame in that.
I was on 50mg of Vyvance for maybe a year and was productive af
"However, my insurance changed and I had to take a 2.5 month break starting at the end of August"
I was more unproductive in those 2.5 months than I had been in years
So much so that my boss noticed a dip in my performance
"

Fast forward to last week, I just got back on meds, but this time through my PCP"
I also requested 30mg instead of 50 to see if I could operate at a similar level
So far I’m loving it.
"Look, you were born with this condition"
It’s a lifetime thing
Would you say someone with diabetes is shackled to their Metformin / Ozempic / insulin? Of course not
Same with ADHD meds
That doesn’t make you a lesser person! Makes you a lot more interesting person IMO
"

Background: 50 y.o"
woman diagnosed just 2 weeks ago
Been on meds since September
I had worked previously (for years) on accepting myself as I am
So this diagnosis is just learning something new about myself
I find it pretty cool
And I love that I can finally concentrate at work and am not longer struggling with brain fog.
"Your body acclimates to the presence of Vyvance in your system, so when you take a break, that's not an accurate picture of what you were like before you started medicating, that's what it feels like to have ADHD dialed up to 11"
" After about a week of being off Vyvance you stabilize, and you will feel less like a slug"
" Vyvance isn't really addictive in the sense that you don't have strong feelings of needing it, or that you would go to great lengths for another dose.."
"It's not painful or biologically stressful, it's just irritating to feel drowsy and unproductive"
" That being said, I don't think you should feel pressured to plan for vyvance not being a lifelong part of your life now"
 I'm just saying don't have anxiety about being an addict
 Vyvance is addictive to ADHD people in the same way a hammer is addictive to a Carpenter
" It's a useful tool which we appreciate the utility of while we're using it, but if we don't have it, our life doesn't collapse around us, we just do our best to find other tools to get the job done.

I don't recommend intentionally planning drug holidays with Vyvance, it just results in wasted days, and I've never experienced any type of rebound effect where the medication becomes super effective after it has been stopped for a while"
" If anything it's slightly the opposite.

My experience comes from forgotten days and a few times forgetting my script while traveling."
I wear glasses everyday because I need them to see clearly
"

I take ADHD medication everyday because I need them to think clearly.

I could walk around with blurry vision and headaches.."
but why would I when I have a solution right there.
Some of us need medication to survive to supplement what our bodies can’t make on their own
" It’s not any kind of fault of ours and we need to stop acting like it’s terrible to be dependent upon a healthy brain chemistry to survive.

Accept it"
 Accept yourself
" Harm comes when we reject our nature, for only then can we become the best version of ourselves."
"I was originally diganosed when I was 25, but didn't start taking meds until 45"
"On top of the school years I wasted *before* I got diagnosed, and the 20 years I wasted *after* I got diagnosed, there's no way in hell I could ever go back"
"Sure, I'd *like* to be able to be this version of me without having to take meds, but I'd also give anything to have been diagnosed when I was back in school to where I could have lived a better life"
I take Vyvanse and it has been a game changer for me
I have less anxiety and depression while taking it
I am so grateful for it
I keep it in my car so that one days when I am rushing I can easily grab it when I realize I didn't take it
"Maybe you could put it in your backpack or something? 

Science has shown that people with ADHD literally have a different brain"
We require additional tools to navigate life
Getting to a point of accepting that brought me a lot of freedom.
I feel you
I’ve been on vyvanse and adderall IR for a couple years
I get my meds delivered and sometimes between me forgetting to make a payment or it being out of stock I’ve had to go without and the withdrawals are bad!
"Take it from someone that did the whole, ""I don't want to be a slave to medication"" thing, for about 15 years"
" Most all of us have this internal struggle, but if you want anything for yourself, you must do something"
" Medication is the first line of defense, but some forms of behavioral therapy can also produce some results, as well as careful discipline and planning and management, the acts of creating a structure to build our lives around"
" Accountability+support is also a key aspect.

But doing nothing will only result in a downward spiral, I can only act as I approach rock bottom, and I've had to accept that medication helps me to take action much sooner."
Idk why people get so worried about being dependent on it
"My brain's natural state is being an anxious depressed scatterbrain that can't communicate, focus, or relax"
The Vyvanse makes all of that better
"I've lived that way for way too long and I don't care if I need a pill to live a better life, as long as I can get it for an affordable price and it's not gonna kill me then what's the problem? I'm not going back I'd rather be a happy drug addict with a better life."
"I remember hearing some of this while I was looking to finally get diagnosed and medicated.

The thing is, of course you are going to feel better with medication that makes you function like a person"
Society isn't setup for people like us
"ADHD is a chronic disability.

Like, if you had to take medication for any other chronic condition would you think the same?"
"As someone who is dependent on vyvanse to function, don’t worry too much about being “shackled to medication”"
"It does suck, having to take a pill everyday to perform at the same level as everyone else, but at least that pill exists"
"I try to practice gratitude and remember that I live in a world that provides me access to accommodations for a condition that never even used to be recognized, let alone treated"
"But I know it’s hard to be grateful sometimes, and it’s okay to be frustrated"
Let yourself be frustrated
"

Just remember, adhd is called a disorder for a reason"
It “disorders” what you are capable of as person
"I see adhd medication as allowing me to be my true self, who I am when I’m “ordered”"
"

This is just my perspective though, I’m not a doctor or professional of any kind, just someone who experiences the same thing."
Like a diabetic addicted to insulin.
"Vyvanse has help me fix my diet lose weight with exercise it has changed my life,definitely for the better I have lost 60 pounds so of course I’m addicted to it."
"If it makes you feel better, why not?"
Insulin diabetes.
Try to find a way to get over the stigma you've placed on yourself
There's nothing wrong with staying on a medication for the rest of your life
" Plenty of people with plenty of conditions or disabilities do it.

It demonstrably helps you"
 Use it to live a better life than you'd have without it.
"It's not addiction, it's dependence"
Could you live without it? Sure
"But, you depend on it for the best quality of life."
I hear you
I couldn't fill mine (Dexedrine 90 mg/day for 3 years so far) for 4 days and literally slept day and night but would wake up and stuff my face then go right back to sleep
Everything started out great
3 years later I regret it
it really helped me get my life together for the first year
Started on Adderall 20 mg twice daily
"Now I just feel constantly overstimulated, chew my tongue all day which I'm sure is sexy and I uncontrollably think out loud at times"
Pretty embarrassing when your inner voice starts spilling out of your mouth but being unable to control it for longer than 5 seconds
My moods are all over the place
I startle easily
If someone drops a spoon or my phone rings I jump out of my skin
I have a substance abuse history so it's both addiction and dependence
"I also oddly crave bud every day to extreme panic levels whereas before I used to smoke it here and there.If I ever muster the courage to get off of these things, it won't be for a tolerance break"
It'll be a permanent goodbye lol but some people do well on stimulants for decades
"I am definitely not one of them and the feeling of being handcuffed to it sucks, I hear you"
You’re not shackled to anything
Our brains are wired differently and you’ve found something that lets you function with the non spicy
Celebrate that.
"Your brain is lacking a chemical, the pill contains the means to get that chemical"
This is just how life is
"Having to take meds is just like having to eat, having to drink, or having to sleep"
Each give something your body needs
For some odd reason people think pills=bad
You can take these as long as doc says it's ok
"I've been taking ADHD meds for 30 years and still am, I'm doing fine."
Usually it takes a few days off meds for me to get back to baseline
 You can try working with your dr to try different meds or XR vs ir or dosages so it's not as pronounced if this is an issue for you
" But yeah I think dependent is the right word and what you're experiencing and feeling are pretty normal.

My understanding is it takes some time for brain chemistry to go back to normal and for us to remember coping skills"
Also you are probably more aware now of the dropoff then before
 But probably best is just take your meds daily or as directed by Dr.
Stop allowing society to beat you down
If the pill makes you the best version of yourself so be it
"You’d be surprised how many people are prescribed medication, but just keep it a secret due to the stigma"
"Look at how many celebs are taking Ozempic, you think they feel bad about losing weight the easy way and looking the best they’ve ever looked in their life"
"I watched a documentary on adhd the other day on Netflix called “Take Your Pills,” and the thing I’ve come to find out about the medication is that it works extremely well and is needed even by those who don’t have adhd, but the social stigma and unknown from those who have never taken the medication launches everyone into a guilt trip to the point they rather see themselves suffer instead of doing what helps them the most"
Every individual on that doc and that I have seen provide testimonials has said the medication works
I think it works so well it’s to the point it scares some people
End of story
Screw everyone else and do what works best for you
Only god can judge.
I actually look forward to my days off from Vyvanse
"Some days it’s ok to just sit home sleep, vegetate, and sleep more."
"But said 'stupid pill' makes you functional otherwise?

Might be time to work on your perspective."
I'm definitely taking it for the rest of my life.
You will definately notice not taking it when you are used to taking it
But if you try without for a longer period the difference will be a lot smaller.
"Oh how i envy you, I probably need it just so badly but the side effects are just so so brutal for me"
Vyvanse was definitely my favorite years ago though
That stinks about feeling tired
I thankfully don't feel tired when I forget to take my meds
"That'd be not fun.

After a few days off your meds you'll even back out to your normal baseline, but hopefully you have made some new mechanisms to help yourself on or off meds."
"You weren’t able to do anything without the pill, you needed the pill for that very reason"
Isn’t that so?
Why do you have to stop taking it at some point?
"There is a ""rebound"" effect when you take stimulants every day then stop taking them, but it goes away after a little while if you decide you don't want to take stimulants any more"
"For now, it sounds like the medication is working so just take it every day and you'll be fine"
Vyvanse works wonders for me but it’s (generic) either out of stock everywhere or  costs me $404 WITH insurance
😕
What you were feeling was exaggerated because ypur body is used to having the medication at hand
"But yeah, if you want your brain to work like you've described, then you'll always need the medication"
And that's ok.
"""I don't want to be shackled to a medication to be my best self for my whole life and I don't really know what to do about any of this.""

A doctor once told me, 25 years ago, you may have to be on this antidepressant pill for the rest of your life"
"I have been and it is Hell without it.

The choice is:

1"
Not Hell with a pill
" 
2"
Hell unmedicated.
“Limitless”
I really wish this could work for me
It made me feel like I was in hell.
"It's okay to take the meds, the same way it's okay to wear glasses most of your life for poor eye sight"
"

Plenty of other conditions rely on a lifetime of other drugs"
You'd be surprised how many daily pills a 60 year old had to take for example
"If this is the only one you're on, you're doing well.

You're not shackled"
It's okay
You can live your life to the fullest now.
I was in a similar headspace about six months ago
"I was thrilled with my progress but worried that I might eventually reach a point where my medication “just gets me back to normal” like you hear about with people who are addicted to recreational drugs.

But now I’ve been medicated daily for over a year and things are only continuing to get better"
"Everyone’s experience is unique but this is mine, hope it helps!"
"If you had diabetes, would you plan to not take your insulin forever?"
The crappiness you felt was the beginning of withdrawal
"When it’s time to go off, your doc should step you down and then you will need to plan for the withdrawal symptoms until they pass"
The craziness you felt is temporary.
I have the same struggle
It took some encouragement from my therapist (who specializes in ADHD) to consider taking my medicine more often
It starts with accepting the reality of the situation and reprogramming the brain to accept yourself
"I recommended getting an actual therapist, though"
"

Willing your greatness"
💛
Your first day off Vyvanse is not representative of living without it
Your body will have a tiny hangover
I personally notice physical fatigue a lot more when of it sometimes
"(usually only because i forgot to fill the prescription or took too few on a trip.)

But I plan to take for for hte rest of my life"
"The benefits far, far outweigh any minor negatives."
"I’ve been on it since September 2002

The longest I’ve gone without it is probably about 3-4 days…

When I’m not on it, I go through different phases"
"

I’m pretty sure this is an addiction, but it’s like an addiction to feeling normal."
That sounds like an awful day :/ I totally get why you don’t want to have to take meds long term
"I also don’t like taking meds and hate the idea of needing to take a pill for the rest of my life lol 😫

I just wanted to say that my doctor once told me that taking medication long-term combined with a good support system & routine can actually help you to be able to not need the meds one day, because it helps reinforce the brain pathways help you function"
"

In my personal experience, it’s been more like there were years where I needed meds and then years where I don’t"
Years where I needed meds tend to be when I had a job or was doing school that doesn’t work for my brain
Years when I didn’t need meds were when my lifestyle worked well with my brain and I had good routines and support systems in place
"

So there’s hope for you yet"
Hang in there! ✊
"im also a bit jealous of people without ADHD, who basically have the “pill” active naturally 24/7"
Aka a brain that isn’t annoying -_-
Vyvanse costs me $168 in the US…
With insurance…
I had to go back to methylphenidate because we couldn’t afford it for longer than 3 months
Vyvanse is by far the best one for me
"

United Health Care sucks!"
I empathize
I've been taking that same pill for years
"
Keep back ups in your car and school bag and even at friends houses you go to often.
I would think about adding a multivitamin with b vitamins in it"
I feel like when I take multivitamins memory is better plus by half way through the day I don't feel like crashing
"
I drank matcha tea when I wasn't on my ADHD medication"
It helped push me through a bit
I had to keep drinking it constantly
But the come down is easier than coffee.
"It’s okay!! Try to think of if it was a physical issue, you wouldn’t mind as much to take it every day"
"For example,  taking a blood pressure medication every day"
"It’s not necessarily an addiction, try not to let the mental health stigma get to you :)"
"The ""I can't do anything without this stupid pill"" is facts though."
The crash when not taking them is REAL
"When I forget my Adderall, I, similarly, can’t focus"
"In contrast, I am the opposite of tired"
I become hyper and can’t sit still
And I talk A LOT.
"If you had diabetes and required insulin to live, you’d take it for life"
Meds for ADHD is kind of similar
"Just  “required to live” would be “required to have a life”, Is it not?"
Saw a video podcast where a Dr
"Who specializes in ADHD put it this way: People with poor vision are not crazy, or weird, theh are different and they need glasses to see life in focus"
 People with ADHD are not crazy or weird and they need medication to focus
"

Take the meds, wear the glasses"
"See clearly, focus!"
i felt the same way when i was a teen
i was diagnosed with adhd since i was like 8 but my parents for whatever reason decided to put me on anti-anxiety/depression medication to treat it
"when i was like 15 i told my parents i wanted to stop taking the medicine because i felt like if it was doing something, then it must be making me someone i'm not"
"and if it wasn't doing anything, then i was wasting everyone's time and money being on it"
" 
now as a medicated adult on my own accord, finally on a stimulant that helps me focus, i can say...yeah, ""shackle"" me to this if it's going to motivate me to get up and participate in life day-to-day"
"wish i was on it sooner, my grades would have been way better."
I feel ya
"I hate that I am addicted to, and dependent on, water, food and oxygen"
Totally sucks that I need these to live a normal life.
don’t beat yourself up
man this is a thought that was put there by the boomers who don’t understand mental health
we shouldn’t be demonizing something that provides relief and allows people with imbalances to build confidence 
"as long as you’re not making decisions that’ll put you in a bad situation on a medication, then there’s no reason to feel guilty about taking something that helps you manage life."
I need contacts/glasses to be able to see
"Am I ""addicted"" to them? No but my life is immeasurably better with them than if I had to do without"
Would I survive without vision assistance? Yes but I would be legally blind
I wouldn't choose blindness for myself just because other people don't need glasses.
"I can't see anything without these stupid glasses, either"
"I've several relatives who can't hear a thing without their hearing aids, or walk without walkers or canes"
*There's no difference*.
"Others have mentioned, and it’s very important: meds help your brain function at its best"
"You wouldn’t take your glasses off that you need to be able to see, you wouldn’t remove mobility aides required to get around, etc.

Another thing that’s very important in growth and development with ADHD is multi-modal ‘treatment’ approaches"
"While meds are critical to function our best, pills don’t teach skills; some kind of therapy or maybe coaching, or some other approaches to identify and learn how to navigate things like organization, communication, self-regulation, introspection, etc"
are all equally as important
"Pills help us learn skills 🫡

I put ‘treatment’ like that because I don’t feel like that is a good word for something that we can’t change about ourselves which is a part of us, and ‘treatment’ typically implies negativity to what is trying to be treated"
There’s nothing wrong with ADHD.
Another example
 Insulin
 Type I diabetics don’t stop needing insulin
 I’m glad you found a pill that helps you
 There are plenty of conditions that we just don’t stop needing to do something about
"Hang in there and enjoy when you can feel alive and if you need a break, then plan for it and know that you’re not gonna get a lot done."
That's like saying I can't do anything without this stupid insulin syringe as a diabetic
It is a disorder and low doses of stimulants are part of the cure
Don't feel bad about getting treated
"It is, unfortunately, for life"
"Our brains remain as they are.

What you've experienced is a rebound effect, which is actually a lot worse with methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta)."
"Better that way then what I am having unmedicated, been waiting 3 years for that pill.

I have done barely anything this week.

Give me some adderall and I work more then I have in a month in a day."
The ADHD subreddit is extremely toxic
"The only opinion you are allowed to have about your own ADHD in that subreddit is that it’s the worst thing that’s ever happened to you, and that medication is a necessary and almost always excellent choice, and that any kind of non-medical coping strategy is just “neurotypical advice” even if it has been empirically demonstrated to be helpful for ADHD"
A lot of “i tried it once and it didn’t work therefore that doesn’t work for ADHD”
"Same vibes as “I exercised once and didn’t lose weight therefore exercise is pointless for me”.

Obviously this is an overgeneralisation, but I find the folks there to be incredibly reactive and intolerant to the slightest suggestion that ADHD can come with strengths as well as weaknesses (even when framed as only my own PERSONAL experience and not a generalisation) or that things like meditation, regular exercise, and using a planner can actually be hugely beneficial if you can successfully form the habit"
Forming habits is fucking hard with ADHD but not impossible
There is a real sense of learned helplessness there which leads to extreme defensiveness against anything that doesn’t align with their worldview.
I seriously feel like it does nothing for me and I’m on 40mg
What am I doing wrong?
I imagine diabetics feel you on this one.
I feel you! I’m not on medication right now and definitely on the struggle bus too
I’ve been looking into lifestyle changes to help manage things
"One idea could be to create a plan to taper off medication while incorporating lifestyle changes gradually.

Research has shown that a plant-based diet can be associated with reduced ADHD symptoms, and there’s also growing evidence about the connection between gut health, the microbiome, and ADHD"
I highly recommend checking out Pam Popper at the Wellness Forum.
Imagine if a diabetic person complained about being dependent on insulin
It’s just an insane pov
"You need this medication to function, so you’re going to have to take it for the rest of your life"
Period
"

Not trying to be harsh but you have to adjust your outlook on this"
"Be grateful that this medicine exists and you have access to it, because there are plenty of people out there who are “stuck as their worst selves” as you put it."
This is ironically the dilemma I am in at the moment
"I stopped taking medication (50MG, Elvanse) when the shortage happened last year (UK)"
I have managed to cope and feel better off the meds
"They changed me and turned me into someone I didn’t recognise, but I kind of liked that person"
"I was so much more active, did really well at work, finally lost weight etc etc"
"But they made me overthink, I stopped finding certain things funny"
"They kind of dulled me as a person and I didn’t like that.

My psychiatrist said he wants me to try again but I’m really really nervous"
I really hated the half way stage and am just terrified that I don’t actually know who I am when I’m in the tablets
"I’ve lived for 33 years without medication, got a pretty good job, amazing relationship, I don’t want the medication to affect that"
Feels like such a first world problem but I wish I didn’t have to worry about this.
"Listen Hun, I get it, it's scary - you've slipped into a couple days of that bad end of things, and m being reintroduced to those negative emotions WHILE under the influence of a tattered mind starts to feel like that gut wrenching fear of being stuck again"
"

A fear so strong that it starts to gaslight you and manipulate you into believing the ONLY REAL escape from this petrifying nightmare.."
"is to lock yourself IN it, because it can't ""make you"" scream in desperate terror if you're already bleeding and screaming..."
"


The you you like isn't a different person, it's the REAL you that just gets buried underneath the side effects of an untreated illness"
"

LIFE itself is what is PLAGUED with a list of soul breaking negative side effects.."
"The pill isn't giving you a clear self as a side effect, The pill is what is FIXING the side effects that kept you from BEING clear"
"


And most importantly, why does it matter? That's the problem with ADHD, when you're unmedicated, you are prone to a weird state of self destruction"
"You can't take a magic pill that makes it possible to do good for yourself, because it's YOU, and therefore having anything or doing anything makes you inherently scum.."
" Anyone that has a problem with you having something that helps you, just needs to be GONE from your life"
"

You are doing amazing"
"It's okay to get scared, but that's the one battle you need to not let win"
"You deserve to be okay, not to suffer"
"


(Ps, do you have a jacket or bag you bring with you? Pack a water bottle and an old matching prescription bottle with half of the current amount in it"
Now you can take one wherever You are when you remember you forgot
)
I hate that I like who I am better with meds
" 
The mindf***  this thought can cause  is excruciating."
"I appreciate all the positive responses but the nuance is you've still got hours without their effects (if not days or even weeks with factors like med shortages) that you've got to live with, no amount of top ups can make the effects all day permanent and even if they could some of us get unpleasant side effects which are just better than the alternative"
"

I still struggle with feeling like the uneducated version of myself is inherently less worthy and it can be hard to get over that."
I relate to the feeling like a different person
"on the pill I am very logical and feel less empathy.

Currently I’m using it to get through my masters program"
"I’d love to be able to stop it after that but will likely need to continue as I can barely get anything done when I’m not on it as well.

![gif](giphy|tZyxxR4lUIRnTgIzl9|downsized)"
Im 24 had this feeling earlier this year when I starts taking adderall
"

You are not shackled by any means to your medication, it’s not a bad thing and is very very freeing for myself and many others - you included it seems"
"

As others have said ADHD is considered a disability and the medications we take are not holding us back but rather supporting us and making us stronger"
"

It was a rough day and a missed medication day"
"They happen and it’s okay, they’re challenging but they exist"
"

There’s no way as far as I know to achieve the same productivity and clarity that comes with medication"
You have a different brain and trying to override it is impossible and will only lead you to exhaust yourself - trust me
"

Different but similar, imagine someone who needs to use a cane to walk around trying to donut without"
They would struggle and not be able to walk like everyone else because they can’t without the support
"

It’s okay"
Take each day at a time and like others have said seeing a therapist would probably help too.
Medication is supposed to be paired with therapy
"I don't know many professionals who do this, though."
“Shackled to a medication to be my best self”
The issue is that your brain chemistry NEEDS the medication to run properly in this world
"But if you are going to come off it, make sure you don’t yo yo back and forth with it"
It’s really bad for your brain to go back on forth on these meds that help alter your brain chemistry.
"Just take your meds, sibling in arms"
"Would you be talking to yourself this way if you had to take a mood stabilizer or an antipsychotic? How about even just an antidepressant? Do you judge everyone else who's medicated for ADHD? You deserve grace and to be able to exist inside of your brain, just like the rest of us.

If you're looking for things to help on days you miss or skip your meds that's a different thing"
"I do extra exercise, that requires mental focus, and eat extra carefully on days that I'm still struggling after taking my meds or when I miss them completely."
That's like saying that you would stop taking the prjescribed meds if you suffered from depression or bipolar disorder or any other mental issue
"Or cancer, etc"
"

Why would you feel you need to stop taking s medication that helps you function better to in society?"
Don't worry about that now-- just get yourself through college through whatever means necessary
"Eventually you might find a career that is exciting enough in itself, that you don't need medication to focus on it"
"That's what happened to me- - I only use caffeine, but over the years I've had jobs that are very motivating to me, jobs I was passionate about, so I didn't have any problem focusing"
"Now if I had a job that was not incredibly personally fulfilling, I probably wouldn't be able to focus."
Dude it’s kind of scary how much those pills help us live a relatively normal life.
I took medications all throughout my childhood and teenage years I quit taking medication when I was 21 it took me about 3 years to teach myself how to function without it
And honestly my wife really help me focus on what was important
When I had to support more than just myself and made me a lot more motivated
I'm still incredibly off task all the time but I can hyper fixate long enough to get an extraordinary amount of work done and be a valuable member of society.
I’ve been off meds for a week now and my husband has been on a work trip since Monday
I feel useless lol
"Luckily, the kids are being good"
I forgot how sleepy I get in th early afternoons
Such a struggle keeping my eyes open
"I hear you speaking from shame, there is nothing wrong with relying on the pill"
Some people already have this naturally on their own with their own DNA/biochemistry but others like us need extra support and there is NOTHING wrong with that.
"I ended up quitting adhd meds and although I will never function like a non adhd person, I’ve just decided to accept that I can’t deal with having to be dependent on these meds and the doctor visits constantly to get more"
If this means a not very successful existence than I guess this is just how it has to be
"Whatever is meant to be for me in
my natural state is all I can do"
😂
People with other conditions have to take their pills everyday for the rest of their lives
Why is it wrong if we do?
"Hey, I'm here to tell you that you would be back to normal by a few months after quitting, especially if you taper down"
  The pre medication you is still there.
"I don't understand why you have to stop taking it at some point? Is it affecting you adversely in some way?
From your description, it does its job when you take it, and when you don't, you suffer from symptoms of your adhd"
"that's just how the medication works.

i have a couple of pills i will have to take for the rest of my life, because my thyroid isn't going to suddenly start working properly, my asthma isn't going to spontaneously disappear, and my adhd brain isn't going to rewire itself"
"we have a disorder, our brains function in a way that works against us and we have to find some way to supplement this deficiency.

adhd meds aren't bandaids, and adhd can't be ""cured"".

if i were you i would think long and hard about why you want to stop taking meds, and if it's anything like ""i shouldn't have to take meds everyday to function"", that is counterlogical bc ignores the fact that you have a disorder"
"you shouldn't have to take meds everyday to function if your brain was ""normal"", but it's not, y'know?"
"also, i think it's worth noting that ""feeling like a different person"" when you're on your meds, as an anxiety, is truly the product of thinking too much.
do you do things you don't want to do when you're medicated?
do you experience major regrets for the things you do when medicated?
do you not understand the motivations behind what you did when you were medicated? does it feel like a stranger made those decisions?
chances are, you're doing the same things your unmedicated brain would want to do, if it had the resources (energy, attention span, not being overstimulated, etc) to do them.
i would talk to a therapist about this, bc it sounds like maybe you have internalized that you're lazy, or unmotivated, or unfriendly, or scatterbrained, or any of the other myriad of negative traits that gets put on people with adhd—to the point that the you on medication doesn't feel like ""you"" anymore bc you don't recognize a ""you"" who is productive, motivated, talkative, or focused."
"It's common to feel this way, but they help you feel better"
Accept reality and think of your personal responsibility
You owe it to yourself to take care of yourself because you deserve it
"

I can't do anything without this stupid pill either"
"

I also can't see shit without my glasses"
"

We need our aids."
"As a first time mom, I had to stop my adhd meds during my pregnancy and during breastfeeding"
I felt so slow and sluggish and confused
"It might have been mom brain too but I know that when I stopped breastfeeding and resumed taking medication, I felt saved"
I was struggling a lot without it
I was still able to function and do what I was supposed to but ouuuuf it was so hard and painful (mentally and emotionally)
I’m thankful to be able to remove from that pain with the help of adhd meds.
"Same , can’t skip a day because I won’t have any strength to do anything beyond a few hours "
Plus the anxiety that comes back 
"Not worth it , I finally feel normal"
"I was diagnosed in my 40s, and Adderall definitely makes me feel like the person I always thought I was."
I am happy your pill works for you
" 
This is an example of success."
"Do you genuinely feel this way about yourself or is it some sort of internalized stigma against mental health disorders (and treatment of them, esp pharmaceutical kinds)?

I hear you and in a perfect world we wouldn't need anything except fresh water and sunshine to curb inattention lol, but we don't live in a perfect world"
"Alas, I think med-induced functionality is better than none."
I have to take mine everyday because of my chronic fatigue
My fatigue makes my mental health so bad and I can sleep for days and be bedbound at some point
I hate how dependent I am on it and how much it could have helped me if I had the resources
I don’t know how I did it for almost 27 years
"I still dropped out of university because of so much stress related to money and even getting and maintaining employment, but it makes such a difference"
"I went down to 30mg (my original starting dose, which got bumped up to 40) because I ended up losing like 30lbs because of the med and stress"
Self care is still important especially when the med can make me do everything except eat and drink.
"> I don't want to be shackled to a medication to be my best self for my whole life

'Shackled to' is a strange way to describe liberation."
"I mean yeah, they are medication"
"It's fine being dependant on them, they are a fix to a problem.

I think everyone should learn how to live without them, just in case of shortages etc"
"But generally I don't see any problems with what you have, just that I'm very happy they work so well for you."
This thread is gold
Ask yourself how much of a life you want to live? Your medication provides you the opportunity to be your best self
Taking it is not a dependency
It is your choice
Stupid is not taking it
I have been taking Ritalin for 35 years
I am grateful
I would do it again.
You started at 50mg?? Bro I’m on 30 and it works amazingly I started at 20mg (I’m also sensitive to meds so keep that in mind) and it only needed one dose up
"Please look into some research about how to use stimulants long term, because I feel like so many doctors don’t highlight the plan for the next 20-30 years"
If we start off with such high doses without practicing skills we’re gonna max the meds out super quick.
"IIt has already messed up my life too much without treatment for decades, i hope i can use forever."
It is good that at least you have something that helps you
"In my country we have just Concerta, which doesn't work for me, so I had to cope by myself until I reached burnout and now I am a wreck."
"There are only 2 ways you ""have to stop taking it"" 1"
Your body has physical health responses that are either long term or worse than your ADHD symptoms or 2
"Stupid medication shortages force you to stop taking it because you can't get your dose
I am currently in reason #2 forced to stop taking my meds"
"I'm still me, just a lot more frustrated and stressed. 
What I will say is before I ran out I would deliberately not take medication on Sundays so I didn't have the possibility of physical tolerance, and to give myself a day to work through managing things without meds as practice in case I needed to"
"This also allowed me to have some backup when the shortage started. 
So if you are really feeling like you need practice handling things without meds or a break for another specific reasons talk to your doc and, try 1 weekend day without them"
I know a lot of pediatricians will suggest that to parents because of food and eating concerns. 
Wow 50mg in 6 months
"I suppose that isn't crazy, and every body is different"
I stuck at 40mg or a little more than half a year (titrated up to that point over another 6 months before sticking to 40)
"If anything, if you want to wean yourself off Vyvanse, do a slow taper with the supervision of your care provider"
"Not sure what the general taper looks like for Vyvanse, but I suppose you can aim to lower your dosage to 40 or 30 in a few months"
"

I guess other things you could try, is take a few days to 2 weeks off vyvanse, for a tolerance break, so when you get back on, perhaps you can start with a lower dosage."
Both adderall and ritalin made me heart uncomfortable but FUCK i miss doing things
Like trying out Qelbree now bc of it and it's just....
worthless in comparison
Like I feel a little better yeah but I still can't do anything rly so I still feel like shit
"Can't wait to see my psych again :,)"
My suggestion would be talking with your therapist about other coping strategies for when you’re on a day off or forget to take it
"
I similarly struggle hard when I don’t take my Vyvanse"
It’s taken me a long time to realize that growing up I relied on inherent aptitude and talent and skated by without developing skills to support those traits
It’s only been this year (I’m now 33 and started meds at age 9) that I’ve begun exploring other ways/routines to help me outside of my meds
"
I hope this helps"
"Regardless if this post, I hope you can find what you’re looking for."
"I wish I could have the effect of the meds forever, but they stop working after a few weeks"
"It's an awful feeling, being so productive on them and then feeling as you describe, constantly tired and unproductive"
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|feels_bad_man)
"as someone who also takes vyvanse, i also feel very weird if i have school or work and forget the pill"
most times i forget or straight up skip to take it on the weekend (i like to sleep in and if i take it any later than 10am i Will Not Sleep that night) and the main difference is that i tend to be unable to focus on anything (duh)
"

if i were you, i would talk with my healthcare provider abt this"
"you could try a lower dosage, and see if the benefits are still there, while helping you not feel so different without it"
"i personally take 40mg, which is my sweet spot"
"30 is not enough to really do anything, and 50 was wayyy too much, i was productive as hell, but i couldn’t sleep and my anxiety was through the roof."
">I don't want to be shackled to a medication to be my best self for my whole life and I don't really know what to do about any of this.

I get that"
It really is difficult living without it
I switched to raw dogging life because I didn't like the side effects
But you have to stop fighting the adhd when you're not on meds in order to get through life
"And it's still really, really hard.

My unsolicited advice? Simplicity"
"The simpler your life, the better"
"But even after figuring all of this out I still want to go back on adderall because it's the most normal I've ever felt ;-; I fit in with others better with it and I got sh!t done.

Without meds, you can figure out what really actually matters in life.

With meds, you can do so much more and be so much more."
They're great comments here
I was just diagnosed at age 55 and the look back on my life was unreal to me
The thought of a diagnosis like this 40-30 even 20 years ago was out of the question even though I've been a self-improvement seeker my whole life and probably as a result of not being diagnosed with ADHD
Now being diagnosed with that as well as PTSD and resulting anxiety and depression it all makes sense that in many ways extend from this lack of medication
"

Watch this video it gives a lot of insight but also talks about the difference between being addicted to a pill and the need for a pill by two psychiatrists I thought it was very informative"
"Good luck and stay on the meds it only matters how you feel about what other people think.

https://youtu.be/370ZBjvu_7U?si=CDNaKOKExxIVSNv_"
I feel like I could have written your first paragraph
 I am always surprised by how talkative I become on adderal
 I am usually extremely quiet and don’t participate much in conversations especially group conversations
" Anywho, all that to say that yes while it sucks to need a medication to function it’s the cards we’ve been dealt"
  There’s no cure for ADHD so if you want to function normally medication is your best bet
 There are definitely others things you can try that don’t involve medication but it will require a lot more effort and time and it won’t help with every aspect of ADHD
 You’ll figure out with time what works best for you
 It’s ok to just be on it while in school and take breaks when you can
 It’s also ok if you don’t want to take breaks because of the disruptions it causes.
Most (or the few I read) of these comments use over the top analogies that are commonly used by psychiatrists and others in the field to explain away concerns patients have about taken medication - controlled substances in particular
"However, I don't think it translates very well, based on the comments I read"
They sound dismissive and mocking vs when you are having a conversation with a professional and they are able to adjust how they explain things based on your concerns/responses/reactions
"Also, a conversation is much different from a bunch of people on the internet who have either never felt as you do or don't remember how it felt if they did"
Your concerns are nothing to joke about
"They are valid, understandable, common, and dare I say, healthy, in my opinion.
There is a lot of stigma, but I don't think that is where the concern originates"
"Medication, especially ones that have noticeable effects quickly and a short half life, are naturally more likely to bring up this concern"
"Separately, this is also a very normal response to any medication that gives you assistance in being able to alter any type of intentional cognitive process.


The most difficult thing though? There's not an easy answer"
"Based on your description, I absolutely understand your fear, and I, not a medical profession, do not think you currently have a problem with the medication.


I am quite impressed, actually, that you were not only aware of the things you mentioned, but also that you were able to write about them with such clarity"
I believe that shows you are much more likely to be able to taper your medication than most people are
"I guarantee nothing, and everyone is different - being comfortable with your own situation is everyone's goal"
"It's completely individual from needing medication or not.


I would make a list of the items you listed and add anything else that you notice"
"What do you like about yourself that you notice is different on the medication, what do you dislike about yourself when you miss a dose.


Then, I would strongly recommend counseling and even if it is a hard no, at least consider counseling as an option"
People have limitless reasons on why counseling isn't for them in addition to what they think happens in counseling
"I once physically dragged my sister (she was probably three times my size), who I referred to the counseling center"
"She tried to bail at the last minute, but that was in 2013, and she had gone willingly since then (different people over the years and now she's a lawyer and certified social worker, in different states)"
Many Universities offer free session and/or will work with you to find an option that works with your situation
"For example, my University offered ten free sessions per year"
"When I got to about session eight, I'd get a form with a few questions about income, and then would be approved for free sessions until the next fall semester started"
"They were always transparent, upfront, and confidential.


You will be able to learn and practice the skills that will help you be the person you want to be"
"If you and your doctor decide to try a different dosage or medication you will have all the support you need whether it's celebrating, adding additional skills, or working on accepting yourself for needing medication in this moment"
"Not everyone has to be on medication forever, and since you have been so observing about what you do and do not like about yourself, choosing a trait to work on, with or without additional support, you can strive to be a person you like better little by little.
Also, at the end of the day, working on yourself is complete separate from taking medication"
"However, why not work towards being a person you like better? You have full control over that."
ADHD is a lifelong disorder that should be treated
 It can really cause a lot of problems and peoples lives if it goes untreated
 I understand not wanting to take pills every day but sometimes we have to understand that we are better off treating our condition than worrying about the medication we are taking and how long we have been taking it
Best wishes ❤️
Im on the same MG and also take a booster of Adderall once a day.
As someone who was diagnosed in college (I was 21) and have taken it for 2.5 years consistently you have no idea how much better I feel reading these comments
"I just graduated college in the spring and am in a ""beach"" period right now in between starting my first full time job"
I've been taking meds since graduating though and I decided to give my body a break for a week and not take any Vyvanse
I have felt nothing less than horrible every day since being off medication..
the last few months I have consistently exercised 3-4 times a week and was hanging out with friends and now I don't have the energy to really do anything that isn't completely necessary for survival
"(I'm sure if I had a job or external obligations I'd be doing more but right now I don't have anything motivating me to get up and moving).

Thank you guys for making me realize that it is okay to take medication"
Seriously
"In my head I still have a stigmatization about medication that is really hard to undo, but I'm slowly working on it"
"I guess I feel guilty using medication in low stakes periods, and I can't fully articulate why, but what I do know is that I deserve to feel happy and productive (especially as a Virgo who thrives on productivity lol)"
So I think I'll start my meds again in the next few days..
maybe
:)
I used to keep a small pill bottle with a few days' worth in my bag at all times just in case I forgot to take it before going to work.
Headed into my 25th year taking some kind of ADHD med
 Will never look back
 Days I forget or choose not to take it are for doing mostly nothing but napping
 You are not addicted.
Whoa this post came at a crazy time for me
I was literally just thinking this after a week of being in medicated and utterly miserable
Like - does this make me an addict?! And if yes - do I even care?
"“I can’t see anything without these stupid glasses”

“I can’t get anywhere without this stupid prosthesis”

“I can’t eat anything without this stupid insulin” 

“I can’t hear anything without this stupid cochlear implant” 

Are there other chronic lifelong conditions people beat themselves up so badly for getting treatment for? "
"When stopping medicine you do have to taper out slowly, when stopping from day to day you will get some withdrawal symptoms"
So that is probably a big part of what you were feeling.
ADHD is neurodevelopmental
"The dopaminergic and adrenergic signaling in your frontal cortex is abnormal.

Your shackled to a medicine the same way a diabetic is or someone getting replacement thyroid hormone.

It's not a moral failure, be kind to yourself."
I will not mind been addictive to a legal drug that makes me a better person
There is nothing really more to add.
I literally just had to drive an hour to give my adhd kid his vyvanse because we both forgot this morning
So fucking tired of it.
"The fact that you can tell there’s a difference, and more importantly a difference you like, means it’s WORKING"
That’s such a good thing
Don’t let society tell you that being on a medication that makes your brain and body work the way you want is bad
You might be dependent on it.
"but if you had to wear glasses to see, would you resent that because you would be dependent on them?"
I can't do anything even with it
"I try not to take my adderall on the weekends and on the days I work from home but holy cow, if I don’t I am exhausted all day, I just want to sleep and I have zero motivation"
My adderall is my saving grace
I just keep my pills in the bag I take with me every day to avoid this
I can always remember and take them at home but if not I have them when I get to work
Trip - get yourself a medicine key chain and only put 1 pill in it
Attach it to either your keys or lanyard
You could also keep the medicine pill keeper in your pencil case.
"ADHD is treatable, not curable"
"Before you had medication, this was probably how you were most days"
"Isn't that why you sought treatment? 

Your unmedicated days likely seem worse because access to medication has raised the bar of what you can do, so the contrast is more noticeable"
"

You have ADHD every day, so unless there's a medical reason to skip days, it makes no sense  to do so IMO."
The people in this sub who try to persuade others from taking their medications that only benefit them need to stop
It only adds to this stigma and causes other people who most likely would benefit from medication to never try it
I was also one of these people who were extremely hesitant to try based on the accounts of their stories
Medication may not work for you and that is okay but for the countless amounts of other people please stop fear mongering.
I started taking medication in the second grade
I'm now a sophomore in college
"What started as one daily medication evolved into 3, two of which are anti anxieties"
"If I don't take my meds I end up trapped in a loop with every muscle in my body tensed, barely processing any input, with 10 different thought trains bottle necking and turning into a giant pile up"
"

I would either be dead, in jail, or committed without my medication"
"It truly is the difference between functioning and not for me, and that's okay"
"I do worry about losing my insurance and not being able to afford my medication, but only because the life that I already struggle through would get infinitely worse"
"

You can either be at peace with the fact that you need a medication to live and function, or don't take it and increase your suffering and your struggle tenfold"
It's your choice
"the world likes to tell us otherwise, but remember that there’s no shame in depending on medicine to get through your days"
"we have a chronic condition – it can be managed, but it’s not like a mental health disorder which might go away after we take our meds and do all the “right” things"
just the same way any other chronic condition will always need support and management
"it’s okay to continue to be supported by medicine throughout your life, that’s why it’s there and it’s nothing to feel shame for (though i understand the instinct to, it’s built deep) 

if you want to create a stronger foundation when you’re off them, certain nutrients are known to help adhd symptoms (zinc, gingko baloba, can’t remember a few others but google should help!) as can all the annoying, difficult stuff like regular exercise, meals and sleep (the catch-22: even though we struggle with it, it all helps a lot with unmedicated management)"
"i personally also kind of take a few unmedicated days here and there on purpose (or when i forget) so i don’t feel like the change on/off meds is quite AS jarring since i’m used to myself off them, but i’m not sure if that really helps or is just in my head 

at the end of the day we are going to feel the heat of our symptoms without our meds and that’s okay, as much as it sucks"
"you don’t need to try not to depend on them unless you want to, but try not to feel shame and beat yourself up for taking them"
you’ve got this OP
You feel this way because it’s a highly addictive substance and you are addicted
It’s super important to monitor and practice self control when taking any stimulant ADHD medication
"Take healthy breaks from it, you’re only human"
Of course I'm addicted
I'm addicted to feeling like a normal person who can fit in
"

Why wouldn't I want to be addicted to that?"
My brother is dependent on his glasses.
"As someone with ADHD in a wheelchair, this, all of this lmao."
I wear glasses because I like being able to see.
"A ton of stigma around mental health and medication, and general public act like that’s old news and we’ve defeated it"
Far from correct lol generations of work ahead.
"I’m highly dependent on my legs, too."
"Oh no! My pancreas is on strike! I got diabetes, at least I could get insulin shots! ""YOU'RE GONNA DEPEND ON INJECTIONS ON STUFF THAT COULD KILL YOU IF YOU GET TOO MUCH BY MISTAKE YOUR WHOLE LIFE?? ARE YOU A GAMBLER???"""
We don’t shame people for needed glasses and actually legally prosecute those that refuse to wear corrective lenses if they want to drive
Glasses are to eyes with vision impairment what meds are to the brain with adhd
My parents have been trying to get me to kick my addiction to these glasses I wear… but I keep going back to experience the ecstasy of perfect vision.
Imagine if you were diagnosed with diabetes and that suddenly clears up why you'd been feeling like shit and maybe had some complications that were attributable to the diabetes all along
"

You wouldn't say to yourself ""You want to be dependent on INSULIN your whole life? A HUMAN HORMONE? "" Would you?"
"“Oh no, i got diagnosed HIV? Good thing modern therapy exists but I need to take it for the rest of my life…”
“YOU WANNA BE DEPENDENT ON TABS FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE? Why won’t you do walks, exercises and let your immune system fight with viruses?”
Also I’m bipolar2"
"
So far I need to take Lamotrigine and Biktarvy for the rest of my life or I’ll either die or die because of suicide"
Taking one more pill which will also let me be functional is not a big deal…
I’m on a walker for a chronic condition
"People do say that about mobility devices as well, especially if you “look healthy”"
You’re just becoming dependent on it because you aren’t forcing yourself to “exercise” the issue.
"Oh man, and then if you tell people you have ADHD and they hit you with the ""you know, it could be from worms in the digestive tract"" or ""it might be all the red 40 dye in your diet causing your symptoms"" I've started responding with ""yeah, it's probably because I had lead poisoning as an infant"" (which is true! But not likely why I have ADHD) and they tend to stop talking after that"
I like you
I'm already on something else I'm going to be taking the rest of my life
"I don't see it any different from my Adderal.

I mean, some idiots will say I'm addicted to estrogen, which sure, if liking something that makes me like what I see in the mirror and care about basically anything is an addiction than sure, I'm addicted to my HRT."
Ask them about their morning cup of coffee
Ask them to go even a week without it
"

They won’t"
"

I love bringing this up because people say “oh ya I bet you haven’t”"
"Well yes, yes I have"
Been coffee and caffeine free for 5 years
And adderall DOES NOT save you from a bad nights rest
Instead you just feel like a semi productive crackhead until you crash and burn like nobodies business.
“Shackled to the wheels” im crying that’s so funny
"I prefer the glasses analogy personally...


it's like u wouldn't tell someone to just deal with their poor vision instead of wearing glasses."
"TAKE THE GLASSES OFF BLINDY, YOU NEED SPECIAL HELP TO SEE HUH?

This is literally what med shamers sound like to me now, I might just take to laughing at them instead of feeling mad tbh"
I'm totally addicted to wearing my glasses and being able to see things.
"I've had these glasses on my face for 23yrs now and still can't see any better without em, weird lol."
"As a wheelchair user, actually you would be amazed…

I can’t speak for other countries, but in the U.S"
"being dependent upon *anything* outside yourself is seen as a negative thing, it’s ridiculous."
Great analogy
 I feel so blessed that there's such a a simple solution for my serious problem.
Thank you
Your comment is so validating to how I feel about being on medication and now I have an excellent response for people who question it.
![gif](giphy|w0a2yc75Ye90DhEZY3)
"Reminds me of Dr House lmfao  
  
""I do not have a pain management problem, I have a pain problem""

Like if I need to take pills to feel normal, wouldn't getting addicted just make it easier for me to remember to take my dose in the morning?"
"Oh no! I am diabetic!

DO YOU WANNA DEPEND ON INSULIN YOUR WHOLE LIFE? DO YOU WANT TO BE TIED TO A SYRINGE?

WHY CAN'T YOU JUST MAKE YOUR OWN INSULIN LIKE A NORMAL PERSON?"
"my dad: you know, you won’t be able to think normally after you take that, right? it’ll mess with your brain 

me: yeah, that’s the entire problem"
I can’t think normally anyway
"so you’re right; if I suddenly stop taking it, I will be back to my normal self."
Thank you for putting that into perspective
"I worry about the idea that people think I'm gonna get addicted when it's like, I literally can function better with it. "
😂
"I feel like this title could be reframed as, ""I can do so much more now, because I have access to a medication that helps me!"""
Best analogy for this I’ve seen
Where does tolerance fit into your view?
That's my thinking as well
"Why do people  think they can will themselves out of chronic conditions just because it's mental? People absolutely should use other tools to help manage symptoms, but just because a diabetic has a really healthy diet doesn't mean they should stop taking insulin."
I mean I have diabetes and just got taken off of metformin
A goal I was trying for
"It's not just the brain, the goal is to try and be on the least amount of medicine possible"
But for a lot of people and maybe myself included ADHD meds are absolutely necessary.
It's because the brain is associated with the mind and therefore with the self
"We don't think of it as an organ but as ""who we are"" and, as such, physical problems with the brain are considered to be moral problems or willpower deficits"
"It's stupid, but that's the answer."
The brain is definitely not the only organ we do this to lol
"

In addition to having ADHD and being on stimulant medication, I am also a chronic pain patient and am reliant on a wheelchair to get around outside of my home"
"I’ve gotten comments about my ADHD medication, my pain medication and even my damn *wheelchair* a couple of times.

Society (in the U.S"
at least) looks negatively upon dependence and reliance on *anything* outside our own proverbial bootstraps
Which is unfortunate for those of us who don’t have any other option if we want to survive and have any kind of life.
"because brain doesnt llike pills, so it does everything to avoid them"
"Heart like pills, I mean it cannot decide nor think"
"I guess maybe a part of it is that it’s up to us to say how our brain feels and aside from like severe mental illnesses it can be hidden, and hiding it is a sign of strength since it impacts your social life and not your physical health mostly.

whereas with other organs, it causes more physical symptoms and it’s easily diagnosed with tests, you can’t really hide your organs not functioning as well as you can with your brain if that makes sense?"
I dealt with so much guilt about not taking my meds on days where I didn’t do much and my therapist asked me “does it help you function and would you tell that to yourself if you were a diabetic and needed insulin”
Really changed my mindset
Yes
I would.
Well done! This is word for word what my therapist said to me when I had this exact issue!
"Because we think the brain can be controlled, use you will, work hard and it will listen"
As if
"It’s not just us, it’s the unwarranted advice the world gives us to be better and not be lazy and just do it"
Beats me.
"Because the brain is a little bit different (more complex) than other organs, the heart or liver won’t tell your body to stop working just because"
Been taking Adderall since 1993
" My dosage is exactly the same as when I started (20 mg), although like you I have also developed strategies that allow me to cut the tablets in half and take 10 mg on some days"
" Things like doing that and regular medication ""vacations"" have allowed me to remain on that same 20 mg dose for 31 years now.

To add to what you said.."
"I have friends who have to take things like anti-depressants and lithobids every day to reach some semblance of ""normal"""
" Frankly, only needing to take something as old and well understood, and with such few side-effects, as a therapeutic dose of of an amphetamine to get that ""normalcy"" is something I'm pretty OK with.

Incidentally, for worries about ""addiction"", a couple of things to note:

1"
"Problems with ADHD and addiction _to anything_ are substancially _lower_ for ADHD individuals being treated with stimulant medication:  https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4147667/ and https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4340791/
2"
It is unusual to become addicted to an amphetamine while taking a therapeutic dose:  https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1185/030079908X280707 ..
"""When oral formulations of psychostimulants are used at recommended doses and frequencies, they are unlikely to yield effects consistent with abuse potential in patients with ADHD.""

I would add, as someone who has experience with both medications, I think of Adderall much as I think of [hydrochlorothiazide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrochlorothiazide), one of the single most common medications used for high-blood pressure"
" It has a handful of generally pretty minor side-effects, you take it every day, it does what it's supposed to do, and you mostly don't really worry about it and get on with your day."
I totally agree with this! As long as systems are put in place and routines are established then the days medication can't be accessed it's not as bad as it used to be
That's nice to look forward to
Thanks
🙂
What dosage did you start with?
Yes!  This is why we old-timers try to get the newbies to get a therapist and a life coach
"I, too, take less methylphenidate than I needed when I was younger"
 And it's not a physical age thing
I just need a lighter touch now.
I agree that my symptoms are “worse” on my off days
"But, those days are still better for me than before I started taking medication because they’re not nearly as stressful"
"Usually, I took care of the big things that I had to get done on my on days, so it’s not such a problem if I’m distracted or unmotivated."
"Same here as both of you lol, except I’m on 70"
"On the days I don’t take it, I’m practically worthless, and I feel like I’m in a worse mood as well"
I don’t like who I am without it
I just recently went two weeks without it and they were brutal
My work suffered and my mood definitely suffered
"For me, all day felt like I just woke up from a deep sleep and just couldn’t wake up"
I think it’s worse now than it was before because we know what it’s like to actually be able to function like a normal human being.
"This ^^^^

I have to wear glasses every day to see, and I take a prescription for my asthma daily, and another prescription for thyroid hormone replacement"
" I will never be cured of these 3 conditions, and if I quit taking my thyroid meds, it WILL kill me"
"If I stop taking my inhaled steroids for asthma, a week with temps below freezing will land me in the ER.

Lifetime dependency on ADHD medication is no different or 'worse'"
"I will always have ADHD, so I will always take medication to treat it."
I ran out of my prescription 2 days ago
"I'm still in the titration phase, but I don't feel I've reached the correct dose or am even using the correct medication"
"

I have had small glimpses, the first day or 2 on the most recent dosage increase, of a more typical, better functioning life.

The last 2 days have been in a fog again, but I  think sometimes the reason it feels worse than before is recency bias"
"We just didn't realize how bad it was before until the meds helped us feel better.

I understand and support the decision of some to limit their prescription drug intake based on their own beliefs and advice of doctors"
"

I do also however support the long time, even permanent use of properly prescribed medication."
"I think a big part of might also be that we get used to the abilities we have on meds that when we go a day without them we notice the difference way more and thus feel worse than before, because we feel incomplete and below our usual competence level"
"It's just that with meds our baseline is much higher.

That's not to say that withdrawal symptoms don't exist, but for me that also happens after only a few days on (new) medication, so it's not just withdrawal."
Strange
I never had issues of it making my emotions dull or creativity
In fact I feel more creative on it
"It helps my emotions in reducing how impulsive I respond to emotions, which I take as a good thing"
" For example, a situation the might have made me mad and lash out at someone I can usually control better under meds than when I'm off of them"
 I'm usually pretty easy going anyway and it's hard to get me mad
"But when I do get to that breaking point, I would usually snap when I'm not medicated"
The Adderall helps me not do that
"To put it another way, it doesn't really change when or how I get mad, but it changes how I react to getting mad."
Saving this comment because wow that’s great advice
"Have you tried changing meds? Adderall made me irritable, but Ritalin doesn't."
Does the exact opposite for me
"Did you try different doses, formulation, or Ritalin"
Just curious cause I’d like to understand your experience or link back to this post for others!
The willing myself to write when the meds aren't working is the hard part.
Exactly! My mental health was so bad for so long there's no way I'm going back.
"My meds aren't working, I've been backsliding, and I forgot just how miserable it was to be in this state"
Like yeah of course people are going to be dependent on something that lets them live a better life.
"How effective is it for mitigating executive dysfunction in your experience? That’s my main problem with ADHD, I’m hoping Vyvanse will be able to help but I haven’t tried it yet."
I think it can be helpful for some people to realize that we don't need to take these meds to avoid dying
And I say that because we are making the choice to care for ourselves
We can stop
But we have active choice in this and that feels freeing for me
Could someone go without a wheel chair? I mean...maybe but what kind of life would that be? Stuck to your couch waiting on someone else to do everything for you
"I have a choice, and I choose my better life every time I take my meds."
Like how much does it cost you monthly?
what chemical is missing?
true
🤦‍♀️💓
Time to switch meds
Not all meds work for everyone :).
Eat
The dose may not be right or it may not be the best med for you
I was on 70mg vyvanse and switched to 30mg focalin IR and it is worlds different with effectiveness
Maybe talk to your Dr about trying a different dose or med.
These top two comments are such perfect replies
Exactly how I feel
You're confusing the definition of addiction
"Just because a medication makes you feel better and you are miserable without doesn't equate to an addiction.

Addiction withdrawal is an adverse physiological reaction to your body not having the medication"
"

Feeling like you did before taking the medication is not withdrawal and not addiction."
I am starting my meds tomorrow and that is a big concern of mine is relying on this medicine forever.
though I’m not sure how it’ll make me feel as I’m 27M raw doggin it up until now
So I suppose it wouldn’t be so bad to feel “normal” for once
"""If I was addicted I wouldn't need an alarm to remember to take it"""
Disgraceful
He should stumble around blindly and be true to himself.
Did he try drinking more water?
We will take his license if he refuses to wear them but don’t punish unmedicated drivers who need it
*Addicted*
"Have you tried optical talk therapy? It's great! They teach you to believe you can see! If you see a red blob in front of you and you can't tell what it is, you learn to just believe in yourself and visualize whatever you want in front of you"
Makes the world such a safer place
I only hit two mannequins on the way to work today.
My problem is toothpaste
"I just feel like I need to use it *every day,* ya know?"
"I was shamed a lot for wearing glasses - as a kid.


Times have changed."
"No no, you don't understand, you just need diet and yoga"
Forget the fact that the side effects of your sugars being crazy make it impossible to exercise or follow/cook for a diet..
You just totally got to do them
"

I can assure you that my ADHD is getting cured by buying that gym membership I went to twice over a year ago that I'm still paying for every month!"
"I literally have chronic digestion issues because I ignore my body’s cues 😭 I think it has more to do with autism, which has a big correlation with digestion issues and typical avoidance behaviors."
Ugh
I’m desperately trying to get on HRT after learning that SO MANY of my other symptoms are because of menopause
And I’m just finishing a bunch of cardiology appointments to see if they’ll still allow me to take my ADHD meds
"😫

Edit to add ‘At my age’"
My T rx took away my horrible PMDD and PMS symptoms that were unaddressed with other medical interventions
"Obviously hard to consider if you don’t want the side effects of facial hair, voice, etc"
but it’s worth it so I don’t have the constant thoughts to kms…
Did/does HRT help with any ADHD symptoms?
Funny I was able to give up coffee much easier when on Adderall
"It doesn't exactly replace coffee exactly, but I don't like the feeling that coffee gives me while under aderall"
"I can drink at most a cup, but even then I still feel the effects though weakened"
"I still like the taste of fresh roasted coffee though, and it's hard to get what I like decaffeinated."
If my brain literally stopped being affected by Ritalin I'd talk to my psychiatrist about it since they're the professionals; that hasn't happened
I think because of the intrinsic differences between physical and mental/emotional issues
"When a problem is expressed that seems or feels to be related to personality or behavior, it feels more like it's something we should be able to change or adapt to on our own or with enough time or effort"
The mental struggles that come with having ADHD feel less like an issue or defect of functioning (of the brain) whereas physical issues or defects are much more easily seen and quantified as an issue of functioning that requires outside intervention to fix or assist
"

People can develop the discipline to become less lazy, procrastinate less, can decide to do and follow through on things like cooking more at home to eat healthier, or tidying up their home, etc"
We know this to be true and have maybe even seen it happen with other people in our lives
"These things are inherently possible, even if they feel or are ""impossible"" for some people (those with executive functioning issues, like myself and everyone else in this sub lol)"
"Whereas you literally, no matter what, *cannot* will or discipline yourself into no longer having faulty heart valves, no longer having diabetes, no longer needing glasses, into no longer having amputated limbs, etc"
"We also know and can verify this to be true, that these things are inherently impossible (some people may argue you can fix and change things like your vision, or diabetes, but that's a different discussion)"
"

Also I would argue that the physical issues are more tangible by their very nature whereas mental challenges that come with issues with the brain are more abstract"
This also makes it harder to realize or accept that dysfunction with our brains causing issues in our lives is an issue of functioning rather than a changeable personality or behavioral trait
"

Bonus point: almost all bodily issues can be tested and verified"
"Your A1C is high and your glucose is whack? Congratulations, you have diabetes"
Can't read these letters on the wall but when we put these specific lenses over your eyes you can? We can tell you exactly what your lack of vision is and you're now the proud new owner of a brand new shiny set of glasses
"But for something like ADHD you just get asked a bunch of questions and depending on how you answer you either have it or you don't, OR you have depression or anxiety instead that just looks like ADHD symptoms, OR you don't have ADHD or depression at all you just weren't given enough structure and taught discipline as a kid so you just have similar struggles to it but you absolutely can teach and train yourself to no longer have those issues"
"It's a wishy washy system at best and so many people easily go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, or get told by a professional that it really is just a lack of discipline rather than an issue of function that needs medication"
"Even when a professional does diagnose it accurately they'll often offer ways to try and adapt yourself or your life around you to the diagnosis rather than suggesting medication, further compounding the issue of feeling like it's more of a behavioral issue than a functional one"
"Not to mention you could see 5 different psychs and 2 out of the 5 may agree on a diagnosis, but you can still get 3-4 different diagnoses from providing the exact same information and answers to all of them"
"It's INCREDIBLY subjective and unverifiable whereas on the flip side you're either missing your legs and need a wheelchair or you aren't.

Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk."
> That's my thinking as well
"Why do people think they can will themselves out of chronic conditions just because it's mental? 

Because they have the incorrect idea that something that's ""them"" divorced from physical reality controls their thoughts without recognizing that they are in fact just their brain"
 And in this case their brain is not working normally.
"Sure, if you *can* eventually function without it and there's a path to get yourself there, it's definitely worth striving for"
"But if it's just something your body isn't doing on its own (producing a chemical necessary for a certain biological process, for example) and there's no other way to function well, I don't think there should be any reservations about using medication"
"And even for those whom it's not a permanent solution, if medication can help reach that goal of functioning without it, that's great too"
"Most importantly, there should be no shame in it"
"

Also congratulations on meeting that goal! That's big!"
It would help a lot if the common idea of the self would shift towards one that's compatible with the brain being just another organ and the self being a super precious but nonetheless physical/chemical product of that organ.
I know exactly what you mean here!
"It's because you can throw money at ADHD in other ways and it might as well not exist whereas the heart doesn't accept cash or card, only eating right, exercise, and medication"
Can't manage your time? Pay someone to do it
Can't manage your personal needs? Pay someone to do it
Your heart is failing? Can't outsource pumping blood to another person (though we're close to being able to outsource it to a more efficient artificial form)
The rich have a history of solving their problems by outsourcing them
"

Everything shameful in this world is something that is only a real (unsolveable) problem for the poor"
The rich just throw money at it until there is no problem
It's what separates the worthy from the filth
"If it's a problem for both classes of people, it's accepted as a sort of universal human fault that can only be improved upon by human made solutions"
Although there's probably less stigma if you're rich around being medicated in certain manners as well
Turns out it pays off to have money
"Everything social can be tied to social status in general.

But relying strictly on medication to resolve something that the rich have numerous avenues to resolve? That's a poor person thing to do"
Which makes it shameful
"Because as someone without financial security, you should be inherently ashamed, don't you know?"
That's heartbreaking
"

No pun intended."
"I do not worry about addiction too much, I have (and am tappering off) an addiction with xanax, and I started taking it after my ADHD medication, funnily enough its easier to get xanax than adderall but so much more addictive and the side effects are really bad"
"Adderall is a walk in the park in comparison! 

I take medication for my depression, an SNRI, as well"
Adderall has helped me so much with depression and PTSD too.
Yes!! Also anxiety over a task doesn’t get compounded
"Like, if I can’t get myself to do it on a non-med day I don’t get that self-loathing dread"
I just push it to the to-do list for a med day and know it’ll get done.
I only started taking it daily 4 years ago to manage my PTSD symptoms
I have adhd but it can be used as a mood stabilizer as well
"I would say when i started taking it daily it was at first 40mg which didnt do much, then 50mg (30mg XR 20 IR) but its been so hard to get XR I am perscribed now 60mg IR (3 x 20 mg pills) a day, but thats mainly because of my doctor wants me to have backups incase of shortage, travel etc"
"I would say I am back to taking 40mg a day.

  
EDIT: That is to say i was taking 60mg a day for over a year, but still have that perscription but dont need all of it :)"
"Well, it’s also because you are physically addicted to the drug, so you start going through withdrawals when you don’t take it"
"I’m the same way, and so I choose not to purposefully not take my medication, as it can really ruin my fragile mental health and put me behind"
"It would take weeks for you to no longer have negative side effects, and on top of that, you would still not be as good as you are on the pill, since the pill is helping to alleviate the problem in the first place.

But the biggest factor is probably the withdrawal, atleast initially."
How long have you been titrating?
I feel like adderall helps me control my emotions better
Things brush off my shoulders better as far as anger/sadness/ any really..
I also feel like it makes me more creative in things I’m INTRIGUED by
And doesn’t make me fake being creative about things idgaf about
"For me, the creative and emotional dulling came with Ritalin when I was a kid"
I don't really feel that way on Adderall
"I'm on 20mg of Vyvanse now, and I'm starting to feel like it's blunting my emotions since I've noticed how passive and foggy I can sometimes feel on it"
Don't know if it's too high or what
Had to stop taking it to confirm
It's a strange balance.
"Good to know, I may want to give it another shot.

I had a bad experience with Ritalin as a teenager, so I've been cautious"
Vyvanse was impossible to get last time I wanted to try something new
"None of the non-stimulant meds have been good long-term solutions for me.

How does the ritalin do with numbing emotions and creativity? How long have you been on it, if you don't mind me asking?"
"Not the original comment poster, but I can tell you my experience"
I have terrible executive dysfunction when not medicated
"

I currently take 30mg Vyvanse"
"Executive function wise, it’s helpful"
"I still have issues starting the task, but it’s much easier to start than without"
I’m much quicker when I start doing it
I’m much more organized and keep things tidy
I can actually follow a cleaning schedule
My emotional regulation is so much better if that’s any issue for you
I can also eat which is important for me & weight lifting
"I always liked being in the gym but couldn’t get myself to go, now I have zero issues with that"
"

YMMV :)

P.S for anyone who might be experiencing vyvanse capsule shortage, check around to see if your pharmacies carry the chewable! They’re typically prescribed for kids so not as affected by the shortage, but your doc can still send in a script for them! They’re also cheaper for me on GoodRx, I buy the generic form."
And yet treatment tends to lead to longer lives as an outcome.
"I mean, untreated ADHD will likely kill you"
It just takes longer.
$30-$100 depending on my med at the time
I’m glad doctors are now aware of antidepressants withdrawal and that’s all I will say.
Yeah they’re both good
I think it's clear they're jokingly saying they're addicted as a way to take the venom out of people accusing ADHD people of being addicts
"If we jokingly say ""well yeah, of course I'm addicted to feeling like a functional person"" it immediately shows them we don't care for them getting in our personal business and insinuating things about stuff they know nothing about."
i think that’s the point they’re trying to make if i’m understanding correctly
"it’s NOT an addiction, it’s help"
but people think that having to take something that makes you live better everyday (when it’s not hurting you) equates to being addicted to it when in reality it’s just using your resources.
"Thank you for this clarification because I've recently been anxious that I'm addicted to my medication, and it's been haunting me like all I worry about at times, so anxious"
Thank you I appreciate your time writing this comment
Thank you
"Yeah, I say I'm 'addicted' to a certain fattening  treat flavor--not just anything, mind you, it's very specific"
It's a good thing I don't gain weight the way I would have before the meds
But I also know what real addiction is
"
It's the context, and lack of visual and auditory feedback here (or any online  text-based discussion, for that matter)."
"Thank you for this clarification because I've recently been anxious that I'm addicted to my medication, and it's been haunting me like all I worry about at times, so anxious"
Thank you I appreciate your time writing this comment
Thank you.
Exactly
"Even with alcohol, if you are addicted to alcohol and suddenly quit cold turkey, you could have a lot of adverse effects including seizures"
"Stopping adderall cold turkey for me = I sleep in too long and notice my cognitive slowing more, forgetful and more tired during the day"
Not life threatening.
"Okay, so I just looked up the definition of addiction and it definitely fits"
I think there are varying degrees of addiction
"I'm addicted to my meds, but not in an unhealthy way"
Pretending I'm not just makes me feel worse when I can't handle my own shit
If you want a slightly less negative connotation you could say dependant instead of addicted but it's the same thing.
Same as you
27m and never took ADHD meds
When I was maybe 19 or 20 I tried some antidepressants and they just really didn’t work for me
I tried for a few months but ultimately ended up hating them
Just didn’t agree with me
"I am now almost through my first full month with Adderall and wow, it’s like night and day honestly"
"

I was getting to a point where I was doing my job, just not as effectively or productive as I knew I probably could be"
"And that compounds… so, I knew I had to change something"
"

My psych ended up prescribing me Adderall and told me that I could take these just on weekdays and skip weekends if I truly wanted to"
And that first weekend I did skip my dose
"But now, I’ve been just taking everyday and I feel like my emotions are way more regulated and I feel so much more efficient and productive and finally feel like a normal person"
Idk how to explain it other than that
It’s just incredible being able to finally sit and do whatever it is that I want or need to do
"I don’t interrupt people, I can intently listen without my mind wandering, I feel more present in the moment… the list goes on"
I have had very minimal side effects as well
Almost nonexistent
"

I hope the same for you"
Good luck to you bud.
The world is full of people who rely on medicine
Medicine is there to help you
"If you can't make your own neurotransmitters, store bought is fine."
I started meds at 28M
I’ll happily take adderall for the rest of my life
I never understood how poorly I did _everything_ until I started taking adderall (with the right dosing)
Good luck!
"If you don't use these meds, you're going to use much less healthy stimulants for the rest of your life anyway.

These are clean without long-term health risks, unlike nicotine or caffeine."
"How many people drink a cup of coffee every day until the day they croak? 

Also, want to be miserable? I don’t"
Virtually every aspect of my life improved after meds
"

Side note - you won’t have to take it every day to function"
"If you’re having to take it every day to function, maybe, just maybe you’re in the wrong line of work"
I can do my job without it
"I’ll be less productive, but I can at least muster my way through"
"

And another thing is if you feel that bad when not taking it mentally or physically; I would argue there’s something else going underneath like depression or a nutrient deficiency which needs to be ruled out before slapping meds on top"
"Zinc, electrolytes, etc and hydration all impact ability to function"
Most people are just dehydrated 24/7 lol
I do try to tell him that he's not putting enough effort in as often as possible.
Only for a couple days a week though
The unimportant days we all have to spare.
I'm not sure because every time we talk I ignore him and tell him to try mindfulness.
"🤣

I'm sure that would work well with my aphantasia."
"> I only hit two mannequins on the way to work today.

lol"
I’m sorry
I was the kid who was jealous of kids with glasses
"ADHD tax, baby!"
"Honestly I have no science backing me, but I have big opinions on that being correlated to an increased stress response from living in a world not designed for us"
"But idk, I have big opinions on everything lol"
"I'm transfem, so I've unfortunately experienced all the uncomfortable, at least for me, side effects of a T puberty and have been working to correct those as much as I can.

Still, the brain fog I had running on T went away within 2 weeks of starting E and I just generally felt.."
more
"Better, but also more, like my emotions were no longer turned down"
"The lows were a bit lower, but the highs were way higher.

It's what finally made me care enough to get an ADHD diagnosis and that had it's own amazing feeling."
Not really
"I'm trans, so my experience might be different"
"Rather I was a bit more motivated to do things than before, including finally seeking out a diagnosis and treatment"
"Mostly in that before I just sort of existed with little enjoyment or care about anything.

HRT let me finally care enough to lose weight and do more than basic hygiene, eventually caring enough to put effort into my appearance.

The last couple of weeks with the recent event we apparently can't talk about and  me rationing my ADHD medication because of the shortages has been a stark reminder how crappy depression and ADHD go together."
🥇
"TLDR: people think mental issues are separate from physical health issues.

But this is not true, it's simply not true"
ADHD also has physical manifestations
"Caffeine also affects many us differently, now why might that be? A drug that usually overstimulates people, can often calm our bodies down to the point where a coffee nap is now a meme"
"

Mental health is not separate from physical health, mental health issues are just primarily symptomatic with our behavior and mood."
"Absolutely, and I feel the same people who feel that way would not encourage a schizophrenic person to stop taking their mental health medications"
"

I think ADHD is so heavily disregarded by people (including those of us who have it) because it effects our ability to be productive and in today's society the worst thing you could possibly be is unproductive, so people can't cope with the idea that they are just inherently out of sync with the world they are forced to participate in."
I mean we're not far removed from the general consensus being that the heart is where love comes from
In relative terms our understanding of the human body is moving forward in leaps and bounds in recent times so I'm confident we'll get to a better understanding of mental health as a society in the near future
Have to go back and look at dates but I think a little over 2 months.
"I got a BA in Studio Art on it, YMMV"
"Even if Ritalin isn't it, there are soooo many now"
"I went through 7 or 8 different variations (higher or lower dosage, fast-acting versus all day, etc.)"
The one I'm taking now is the best and I have no negative side effects
"Adderall prevented me from sleeping, methylphenidate had almost no effects, Vyvanse made me less stressed but dumber, and now I'm taking Strattera.

It completely took away my stress - night-and-day"
I don't feel anxiety anymore and am clear-headed most of the time
"I still bounce around, but I'm more relaxed"
I am not overthinking as much and can handle most stressful things.
"> Good to know, I may want to give it another shot.

Definitely experiment"
" I take Concerta and sometimes a Ritalin booster for flexibility and after narrowing down the things that actually cause the side effects for me (dehydration, not enough protein, not enough exercise, not enough sleep), the drug is flawless"
"No side effects at all, because I don't need a high dosage when those things are right.

If you're getting side effects on all ADHD drugs, look at those areas first and see if you're coming up short and taking more drug than you need to try to make them work better"
" You can power your way through a lack of clean living with a higher dose, but then the side effects start mounting.

>How does the ritalin do with numbing emotions and creativity? How long have you been on it, if you don't mind me asking?

I've been on it for 34 years"
" It definitely gives me more emotional control, but I don't experience blunting unless I take too much"
And I'm just as creative as I ever was.
Vyvanse is amazing and even off brand.
I get that it probably was meant to be a joke
"

However, the pain we feel when people make comments about ADHD not being real or serious or just get over it or everyone has a little bit of ADHD, can have the same effect on someone struggling with real addiction by this statement, even if it was meant as a joke."
I won't repeat what I said but see my other reply to the other person that replied to this comment.
"The problem I had is that there are people really struggling with real addiction in these types of subs, and these jokes can hurt as much as someone taking your ADHD lightly"
Have a great day.
I feel this
Thanks for your input.
"Potato, potato"
Wish you the best!
I also got prescribed Adderall so hopefully I can have a similar outcome 🤞 thanks
"Idk about you but I do need to take my meds every day to function, even on my days off when I go birding"
"I have to drive, for one thing"
If I don’t take my meds then I just…sit there.
there’s nothing wrong with not taking your ADHD meds everyday (or not taking them at all for that matter) but everyone’s baseline in terms of symptom severity is different therefore we all have equally different needs
i take mine nearly everyday and feel good about it because i know that it is an act of kindness towards myself to do what i need to take care of myself instead of settling for a worse life just to prove myself to people who can’t and don’t know what it’s like to live as me.

It's just the overall and unfortunate perception by almost everyone
"If science had started focusing on mental issues (instead of turning them into character flaws or calling it demons, possession, spirits, or whatever else) as soon as it did physical health I'm sure we'd be in an incredibly different spot today"
I get why it didn't happen though given how tangible physical issues are and how abstract mental ones are
Doesn't make it any less shitty though.
I dunno
" 

I do feel addicted to my meds/the feeling that I get from having them regularly"
 The thought of not having them AND the thought of needing them are both terrifying
" 

Our bodies are physiologically dependent on these substances once we commit to taking them regularly"
"

Psychologically, I don’t love who I am without my meds and that’s a deep thing to sit with."
"except they aren’t saying addiction isn’t serious, so i don’t see how it’s comparable"
"when someone says something, they are responsible for what they have said."
"on the other hand, the person hearing it is responsible for their own emotion and how they deal with it"
 many forget that
Also humor or making light of a situation is helpful
 Humor can be positive
 If we all worried about how what we say is going to hurt or offend other people constantly.
it can lead to silence
🤫 We are not responsible for other people only ourselves
"There are exceptions, nothing is really black and white."
I just see so many extremes now where I feel it’s getting to the point that we are bending over backwards to not hurt other people and murdering ourselves instead.
So you just sat there till you got medicated?
Fair enough
"I know this is the case for some people, but not a majority in my experience."
I agree with you 100%
Im just saying you won’t be stranded on a desert island if you take them regularly and forget a day or can’t for a day here and there
Although I also recognize there’s a few people (my good friend being one of them) who I would not feel safe getting in a car with if they haven’t taken their meds
I know a lot of very ADD/ADHD people and this person is the only one I know who has it that bad lol
"By their most common definitions, Addiction and dependence can coexist, but “addiction” is not the same as “dependence”"
"

Addiction is effectively Abuse/misuse of a substance and involves compulsion, harmful use and negative behavioral changes"
"

Dependence is a reliance on a substance to function, and can features things like physical “withdrawal” symptoms and tolerance"
" After 25 years, I certainly have physical dependence on stimulant meds, but I never abuse them or use them compulsively"
"

If I miss a dose, my functioning for that day is usually relatively crappy and I *feel* tired and kinda lethargic, lacking motivation and EF"
"That doesn’t mean I’m “addicted”, it just means that I take a medication that significantly impacts and benefits my daily functioning, so suddenly stopping takes away its benefits as well as causing some mild withdrawal symptoms"

I feel you..
Addiction is MILES away from physical dependence
"Not EVERYONE abuses pain meds, but within the chronic pain community, Drs treat us ALL like addicts"
"Even though many of us have taken our meds responsibility for DECADES & have ever only experienced bodily dependance, even when facing withdrawals from abruptly losing meds"
I don't like how other people's addictive behaviors have so tremendously impacted my own experience with pain and disability..

I just find it offensive even in jest to say someone with ADHD is addicted to stimulants, just like saying someone with diabetes is addicted to insulin.

Sorry that you feel differently."
"I never said, the phrase you put in quotes in your response to me"
"I don't believe I responded to them inappropriately, because they engaged with my comment first telling me I'm completely off base"
I get this as a sensitive subject I have ADHD as well
I'm just going to move on now.
I’m obviously in here because I have my own ADHD struggles
" 

You can’t say that our experiences are the same"
" Hell, one/both of us might even have co-morbidities that affect the way we experience these things"
"

Whether you like the way I characterize the feeling is fine"
" 

However, coming into a forum where a person is being vulnerable and pulling out the DSM pedantry will maybe win you a sticker but it doesn’t help the OP"
" 

You are obviously intelligent, but generally people need understanding"
"I find it helpful to make corrections here and there, but there’s a point where taking the general point being made or just letting it be is most compassionate"
" 

I’ve never walked away from a situation where I basically state (and then double down) on something, implying my superiority and feel better at the end"
 Sometimes it feels *right*
"But, when I get to that kind of rationale, I know I’ve actually veered far from the actual point"
"

I’m not going to wish you the best because it always sounds like a patronizing version of stomping off"
"

I will invite you to talk about the BS of our minds f***ing with us, how much insurance/pharma sucks by allowing us to be lulled into security of having their meds and then having shortages or denying claims or hiking co-pays…

Being smart is awesome and can be fun when not taken too seriously"
" 

Sounds like you’re in the suck; guessing you don’t want me to say “well, actually…”"
"You probably want me to just say “yup, I get it"
Sucks”
" 

But, what do I know?"

School is very difficult for us adhders because we do enjoy learning, just can’t do it from reading a book and flash cards"

"

Basically make every lesson interactive in some way"
I’ll do matching or grouping games with actual physical cards
I’m taking anatomy right now and I have a skeleton I use during classes to literally see what we’re learning about because I can’t connect those dots afterwards
I am investing in a big skeleton poster so I can stick labels onto it with Velcro and make a game of it
I say things out loud and talk to myself when I’m doing work because it makes it ~that~ much more tangible

"You talk to your primary physician, get a referral to an ADHD specialist and get a diagnosis"
You'd have better odds convincing a police officer to not give you a speeding ticket after getting clocked at 90 then to convince a psychiatrist what meds you need lol
"If they still refuse after that, get a new psychiatrist, and ask said specialist for one."
Depression can come from untreated ADHD
So sometimes it’s really not depression
Tell them you’ve been reading about ADHD and that you feel like you have it
And then go from there
They may want to do further testing or sometimes they will diagnose with you telling them your symptoms
Good luck!
Do not ask for stimulants.
it is a huge red flag
"If you’ve been diagnosed , you deserve treatment for it and a good doctor should work with you on finding what works for you"
"

My diagnosis involved a lot of different tests , not in order to find out if I had adhd , but each were to eliminate the possibility of me not having adhd."
this process is understandable if you’ve had different diagnoses in the past.
Ask for it
Just ask
"They will probably reply that stimulants are not recommended when there is also a history of depression, they prefer a non-stimulant like atomoxetine"
But that practice varies from country to country.
I've decided to decline any treatment for depression they offer and pursue any treatment they offer for adhd
"I may not walk away with a stimulant today, but if I was ever going to focus on a solution for my problems, it has to be now"
"If I get anti depressants, I'll just end up getting comfortable with how I live, and I don't want that"
I want this drive behind me telling me to get up and do something
I just want to be able to do what I need to do.
"Turns out, it never mattered"
They took my blood pressure and sent me to the er without a script for anything
It's pointless
I give up.
"I did that when I had a pcp, I was too scared to follow through"
I'm not good at making phone calls.
"I was diagnosed as a kid, but I don't have access to the medical records, my pediatrician only kept records for so long and I don't know how to contact the doctor that diagnosed me as a teen"
My mom doesn't either
I need a fresh diagnosis and I've been having trouble following through the steps to get there.
"You're right, and that's what I was thinking, that it's a red flag"
"That's the way I always think, though, and every time, I follow their advice and get stuck with feeling comfortable at failing at life because I'm on anti-depressant meds that take away this stress.

I don't have a problem with the stress"
It wouldn't be there if I could operate properly
"If I stop feeling this stress, I'll stop looking for help, and I don't want to do that"
"I need to be treated for the cause (adhd), not the symptom (depression)."
"My last doctor gave me that (strattera, right?) I took it for a month but lost my insurance"
I took what I had while I had it but never noticed a significant change
I'd be willing to try again if it's my only option.

"There are both stimulant and non-stimulant options, with some of them being used especially for people with a history of substance abuse, as they have very low to non-existent risks to cause addiction"

I suggest you find a good psychotherapist who is open to discussing ADHD"

I took my 2nd Medikinet pill today with food
"
Yesterday I took it without food and got restless in about an hour.
Today it feels a lot better than yesterday.
Often times medicine might be recommended to be taken with food because it might irritate your stomach"
With Medikinet you need to take it with food so the delayed release can work the way it's supposed to
"Otherwise the delay might not be enough and you might get too big of a dosage too fast resulting in the symptoms you described.

Disclamer: I'm not a doctor and this is only what I've learned from my pharmacist wife.

Yeah I do the same
It's so frustrating
hAvE yOu TrIeD uSiNg A pLaNnEr? Man I've tried the planners the notebooks the sticky notes the alarms the calendars the reminders the to-do apps the note taking apps and stuff that I no longer remember
Always excited that the new shiny thing is gonna ✨ fix everything ✨
This is the dream! Can you share the apps you are using and any other tips that helped to get started and maintain?
I love when lists become part of my hyperfixation in an attempt to fix my life.
I’m not but have considered options for keeping track of things cause I just can’t anymore
" What apps do you use?  I was using MS Notes in 365 but I’m not consistent and not sure how best to organize thoughts / ideas from others, notes from different days"
" I think if what you’re doing is working, I hen good on you!"
"A whiteboard on my office , a white board in my kitchen for family stuff, on the phone reminders, calendars, also I sent to myself scheduled emails as well if I want to remember something later on , some apps but not use them anymore"
"I had a couple of CBT sessions on organizing and planning.

The very first rule was: use only ONE app for tasks, and ONE for calendar.

I used to have a million todo lists, in Google Keep, in OneNote, in Notepad, on physical notes, etc."
"I regularly had tasks on my to-do lists that said ""organize todo lists"" lmao.

I switched to TickTick, a todo app, and committed to use this one app, and this one only, for tasks.

It works great, as long as you have a daily/weekly system to add/organize/schedule/and EXECUTE tasks.

 And that's where the big problem is (for me): a tool can be perfect, but if you don't use it consistently, it's worth nothing"
"I still find myself adding tasks, planning them on a certain day and time."
"and then delaying them and clicking ""do tomorrow"" indefinitely..."
I really appreciate keeping track of tasks in Todoist and all of my notes In Obsidian
"

It took awhile to set everything up and establish it as a routine, but my brain has accepted that “Todoist” is where tasks go.

I still have lists on my refrigerator for things to buy at the store and stuff like that.

I feel your pain though"
"I used to have notes across word documents, 3 physics notebooks, Google Keep, Google calendar, email reminders, etc"
"

It feels so much nicer to centralize everything but we’ll see how it works in another 3 months (hard to keep my habits going in the winter)."
Are they all for different purposes or contexts? It would make sense that's the case
I have one for home; one for grad school; and one for projects outside of grad school.
I create only one at a time
"Two weeks later I have forgotten that I created one, and will create another"
"Months later, I find a number of different notebooks with Very Important lists, and digital notes spread out on 5 different apps"
All forgotten
Sigh.
Microsoft to do list is my personal go to
I also use Google calendar with notifications of when it is going to happen
Useful as on mobile you can set it to have travel time to stop time blindness
"I use music alarms for when I have to get ready for bed, then 10 minutes before sleep"
I also use a music alarm for getting out of bed (a default alarm for my actual alarm as to not end up hating any song) and then another music alarm 10 minutes before I should be done getting ready
"

I also time out each step and how long it takes me to get ready for the day, and get ready for bed"
I can then make that a solid block in my schedule to block out and time properly
"There are days where I go through ruts and don’t properly use the schedule, but I know it’ll be there the next day when I’m back at it."
"Hero status, OP"
The struggle is real..
"I got into home automation with the thought that we could use it to track tasks (one thing I wanted to do was report on tasks completed, because.."
Apparently that's unbelievable)
"Turns out, tasks are pretty limited in Home Assistant"
But it's been fun measuring temps and creating lighting scenes
"Meanwhile, I'm back to using [kanbanflow.com](http://kanbanflow.com) (and sharing my kanban with my wife)"
And notebooks
Stickies
Google Keep
Index cards
Envelopes
Sigh...
Why are we like this?
Oh yeah! I'm great at making a plan and a system
"If I followed the plan, I would struggle waayyyy less"
Unfortunately it's executing the plan that's the problem
Neverending cycle 🥲
Jfc yes
My new go-to is trying to get AI to do things I can't do
I've spent months trying at this point
Training agents and what not
"Much longer than doing the thing itself would have taken, if I could just GET STARTED. "
Willing to share which apps? 😅😅
You're definitely ahead of me! I loose everything
Yes even in my phone 🤦‍♀️
What are these for and how are they helping? I'm a novice with adhd help and also tech
So do give me some insights guys!
I’ve realized there is no true “fix” but different methods and techniques really make quality of life better
I always have an open notebook on my counter
Just a plain 1$ notebook
This helps me see what I have planned for the day
"Also a few random whiteboards around the house, whiteboard calander, sticky notes scattered about, I then use iPhone for reminders, notes, and calendar"
"I have all my apps organized by categories on my homescreen on the last few pages, then I have huge widgets for the calander/notes/reminders.

It’s what’s best works for me atm"
I’ve tried so many apps and fancy planners and it never sticks
I actually just found a giant box of planners and notebooks from the last 20 years piled up in a box in my closet
"It’s funny to look back and a random week or so of consistency in my notebooks, only for the next few random entries be months later"
This would be a pattern for most of my life
"I was convinced that if I just did “x,y,z” that I’d finally figure it out and not suck at life.

I was only recently diagnosed in adulthood, so we shall see how the consistency lasts now that I’m taking advantage of all treatment options.

At the end of the day I really believe it’s about creating a system that works for you, and everyone is so different."
"I’ve tried all kinds of apps, it seems like every other week for a while I was downloading list and to do apps"
"But I never ended up liking any of them, and they didn’t do what I needed.
And then I found ONENOTE  that is Microsoft and is free"
" 
I freaking love it !  Finally now I’m trying to organize all of my other notes I have into this one"
"Because I finally found something good.
I lots of times save Instagram or TikTok post that I like and you can even share that post to ONENOTE, and then as long as you make a decent title, you will be able to search your notes"
"  And that’s one of the best parts, because I might forget where I even put the note at if it’s not in the right category, but I can always search and then find what I need right away now"
It’s been working very well.
"""ADHD people aren't good at planning...""

FALSE"
"We're incredibly, frighteningly good at planning"
Planning is so important
"If we don't get our system set up now, we'll just be doing things mega inefficiently for the rest of our lives.

So when the time for doing comes around, but our plans aren't just so yet, we make a noble short term sacrifice in the interests of the long term good"
"Just for an extra few days though bro, we'll be all sorted out by then"
(I've been saying this for three decades now but trust me this time bro I'm just one plan away from finally being ready)
The ADHD subreddit is extremely toxic
"The only opinion you are allowed to have about your own ADHD in that subreddit is that it’s the worst thing that’s ever happened to you, and that medication is a necessary and almost always excellent choice, and that any kind of non-medical coping strategy is just “neurotypical advice” even if it has been empirically demonstrated to be helpful for ADHD"
A lot of “i tried it once and it didn’t work therefore that doesn’t work for ADHD”
"Same vibes as “I exercised once and didn’t lose weight therefore exercise is pointless for me”.

Obviously this is an overgeneralisation, but I find the folks there to be incredibly reactive and intolerant to the slightest suggestion that ADHD can come with strengths as well as weaknesses (even when framed as only my own PERSONAL experience and not a generalisation) or that things like meditation, regular exercise, and using a planner can actually be hugely beneficial if you can successfully form the habit"
Forming habits is fucking hard with ADHD but not impossible
There is a real sense of learned helplessness there which leads to extreme defensiveness against anything that doesn’t align with their worldview.
"1 calendar, 1 to do list app, and alarms works for me"
Too many is overload
"Hardest bit is staying consistent with it, and not dropping it after 1 bad day."
Microsoft to do list is my personal go to
I also use Google calendar with notifications of when it is going to happen
Useful as on mobile you can set it to have travel time to stop time blindness
"I use music alarms for when I have to get ready for bed, then 10 minutes before sleep"
I also use a music alarm for getting out of bed (a default alarm for my actual alarm as to not end up hating any song) and then another music alarm 10 minutes before I should be done getting ready
"

I also time out each step and how long it takes me to get ready for the day, and get ready for bed"
I can then make that a solid block in my schedule to block out and time properly
"There are days where I go through ruts and don’t properly use the schedule, but I know it’ll be there the next day when I’m back at it."
This
I ask Siri to remind me all the time.
Immediately I use my calendar app to record things
"

Can't wait to do it later"
Do it as Immediately as possible.
It's like our past selves left little surprises for our present selves
Not frustrating at all
/s
It is really easy to get distracted and forget what tasks you have to do
I put another comment on here about what I use and how.
I've implemented that same strategy many times over the years and the results were vastly different from yours
Different brains
Really glad it works for you though.
Appreciate the kind words <3

I nearly fell asleep because the sounds of the MRI were sounding to me
Also weird haha
"i hear you, and remember having an issue with this before i even knew what ADHD was."
The fact that they had weights and straps on hand shows that they’re needed often enough to need to have them on hand
You are certainly not alone!
I had an mri two days ago on my knee and I kept trying to move my feet to the music 😆 That was a no go
They kept yelling at me to stop 😅
"Yeah, I had an MRI for my liver, and it took almost an hour because I couldn't stop twitching"
"😂

Today, I had to get an ultrasound on my testicles and didn't move an inch because I was paralyzed in embarrassment.

My tech was truly awesome, though, and made me feel as comfortable as possible considering a stranger was fondling my boys with soundwaves.

So far, there is nothing to report.."
results are tomorrow!
lol I’ve had a few MRIs and had similar issues
Also after a while it was even harder bc my arm was in weird positions and I just really wanted to move it to stretch it out a little! Eventually they’ll get it
Tried to keep my eyes open on my last one
It's weird nothing but white plastic
Then I started to see things that I can only describe as my blood flowing through my pupils.
looked like those movies where there in a colorful psychedelic trip
Except only green tie dye.
Semi different issue but I needed a full torso CT scan
after the first image the tech asked me if I’d put something in my cr0tch? I was obviously like… no! Until I realized my headphones in my sweatpants had migrated into the cr0tch region
Completely forgot I had them
The tech literally said that was the “first time [he’d] ever seen this”
I wanted to crawl into a cave
Me too!
Yea it’s calming.
XD
True 😆
lol!!!
Lol!!! I hope results are good news!
Eventually😆

No advice only solidarity
I cannot get enough sleep no matter what
So much of my life has been damaged by that!
"You probably have tried all these, but I'll go throught the list just in case:

* does your ~~piss~~ look transparent, if no then drink more water
* do you drink caffeine after 2 pm? Don't, it messes with your sleep quality making you feel more tired.
   * it takes at least 10 hours to get it out of your system
* do you get at least 30 minutes of exercise in a day? Just walking to the store and back is enough
* Do you wake up and go to sleep at the same time every day? Try your best
* Do you take naps during the day? Try to avoid it, drink water or go for a walk
   * if absolutely necessary, sleep no more than 20 minutes
* Do you take your ritalin at the same time every day? Only take it in the morning, it destroys sleep quality
* Avoid alcohol

  
You may just be severely depressed, in any case I would see a doctor if none of the above work.

"Vitamin deficiencies 

Get blood work done.

When I got tested, my vitamin D measured at 11"
Normal range is like 30-100
"I was always tired, depressed, anxious.

I also had low iron, had to be put on 1,000mg/day.

Literally life changing"
"

Get some sun in the morning, at least 20 minutes"
"Drink a lot of water, too."
Have you been tested for sleep apnea? What about anemia labs? Vitamin levels?
Are you on prescription stimulants?
Same here
This has been one of my greatest struggles in life
Always tired
No sleep is ever enough
Please read up on the effects cafeïne has on ADHD
It will blow your mind.
Get blood work done
"Full thyroid panels, iron levels, b12, etc etc"
"If results are all within the appropriate range, get a referral to a sleep specialist and get an overnight study done (sleep apnea, RLS, etc) and a daytime study called the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT)"
I ended up having narcolepsy in addition to my ADHD.
I felt this in my soul
I had similar problems until I got a CPAP
Now I'm great with 6.5-7.5 hours of sleep
I didn't have apnea but I did snore a lot
It probably started around 22
"

Depending on your age, you may just need more sleep"
Teens need around 10 hours of sleep a day
24-40 7-9 hours
"After 40 it starts slowly going down.

Also check the quality of your sleep in general"
I had to stop letting the cats in the room with me because they'd fight and wake me up a little and one would try to sleep on my head.
Honestly? You probably need to stop taking all of it
Wean yourself off caffeine completely
You're probably not getting restful sleep
I did this many years ago and felt SO much better in the morning when all I was drinking was water.
I feel so heard.
"I had never felt awake, stimulant meds were amazing, but the crash was horrible, I forgot how tired I felt all the time until they wore off"
"I’m now on Strattera, which takes away the tired feeling, it’s been great for me"
"Can feel a bit nauseous when I first take it, so I have it at night just before I go to sleep so I can mostly skip feeling sick."
" Hypersomnia is a lesser known symptom of adhd,


 some get hyperactivity or Insomnia, or a mix.


some get hypersomnia and  just sleep all the time until the right med mix is found.




You said Caffeine makes you sleepy,  but get some temporary boost from 5 hour energy.  If your doctor doesn't know this, tell them.


 Those B vitamins in 5Hour may be what your body is screaming for.


My husband struggled with Hypersomnia and was constantly getting fired for falling asleep at work until he got his ADHD diagnosis and found the right med.


I hope you find a doctor that takes your symptoms seriously and is willing to adjust or change your meds."
"Sounds potentially depression and burnout-like 

For me it’s a cumulative feeling of not getting the shit done I want to get done , despite applying effort"
 With adhd the task efficiency can be low
 High effort with low efficiency is a recipe for burnout.
Ye
Have you had a sleep study? I was like this and turns out it was sleep apnea
"Vitamin deficiencies, sensitivity to caffeine (which takes an extremely long time to leave your body"
Do NOT drink past 3pm)
Taking stimulants too late
"Breathing problems, temperature problems"
Are you eating well before bed? Hunger will try to wake you up
"How's your blue light habit? 

Tldr, get tested for everything and enforce sleep hygiene."
This is a huge issue for me too
Have you tried taking a bit of a caffeine break? Try to lower tolerance a bit if you can and avoid the energy drinks
"(this coming from a person that used to have a goal of downing 2 red bulls before 10am then switching to soda)

I have also been trying to wear my body down with exercise, taking magnesium supplements a few times a week and really trying to hit 7-8hrs of sleep"
"If I sleep 9-10+, I’ll be groggy all day"
"

I’m finally feeling what I have read so much about for years and struggled with, that sleep cannot be fixed or help within a 1-2 day span"
"You have to make consistent habits and avoid looking for big surges of energy through the day, trying to aim for slow and sustainable energy"
"

At least that’s some of what has worked for me
recently"
Trying to keep consistent habits or remember what I’ve learned/experienced is my struggle
When I fall off I’ll spend months letting anxiety run me.
"I start every day with a 12oz sugar-free redbull and two cups of strong, black coffee"
"About 4ish hrs later, I have another 12oz sugar-free redbull"
No increased heart rate or shakiness
It just makes me feel normal
"Doesn't matter how much sleep I get, either."
It's the volume of thoughts you have and the amount of tabs you have open in your brain's browser
And the amount of battery that your brain is consuming.
I don’t have advice but just wanted to let you know you are not alone
"I’ve done every single lab test suggested here (iron, vitamins, etc) I had a sleep study in 2020 and was diagnosed with sleep apnea so I’ve been using cpap for 4 years"
"My usage is perfect, but still I have such intense fatigue"
"I went for a sleep titration study and that came back perfect, so no issues with the apnea and it’s well treated"
My doctor will not look any further into my fatigue so I ordered some of my own labs like cortisol and acth to check adrenal function and those were normal as well
I feel so defeated :( I’m also on Ritalin 30mg ER morning and 10mg afternoon
"FWIW, not all sleep is equal, and more is not always better"
A lot of us deal with insomnia to some degree
"Do some research on general sleep hygiene, and if those tips don't help, talk to your doctor"
Maybe get a sleep study done to investigate whether the sleep you are getting is of impaired quality
One of the most impactful things to me is consistency and habit
Try to get a consistent amount of sleep -  too much can make you just as groggy as too little
" And try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on the weekends.

Personally, I gave up caffeine entirely several years ago and never look back"
"At first it was no caffeine after 12pm because insomnia, then it was just none at all"
"To be clear, I am still taking stimulant meds first thing in the morning, so it's not like I have no chemical assistance"
"That said, I never really felt much kick from caffeine before, and now I have FAR fewer days when I feel like I even need a kick to get going"
"Obviously YMMV, but something to consider."
Have you talked to your doctor? I was having serious fatigue issues and a round of bloodwork identified things that helped fix it
Along with upping my Adderall because I had felt like it was no longer doing anything at all.
I have gone through many periods where I've felt the same way
"

A few things that help: 

1"
"Any extra movement, even if a full workout or walk isn't feasible"
Just a little something
"

2"
Sunlight and fresh air
"When the weather permits, I try to have my coffee on the deck in the morning"
I also have a happy light on my desk in the winter
"

3"
"Water with hydration packets because plain water didn't seem to ""stay"" in my body"
"

4"
Sleeping with a sleep mask to try and get more deep sleep.
This is me
"

Turns out I have sleep apnea (that was missed on my first sleep study) and narcolepsy type 2"
"

I'm currently on 40 mg Adderall XR, 100 mg Modafinil, and 150 mg Wellbutrin, and I could still fall asleep at any moment and never feel rested"
"

No improvement from using a CPAP"
"

I feel your pain, It's hard, man."
"Have you tried supplements like Vitamin B (complex) and Magnesium? (don't get the Magnesium oxide, the body can't absorb it)"
"Curious if you’re doing much exercise? I can feel like this and it’s counter intuitive but your energy system gets fired up with exercise and it really helps balance things up (alongside medication too, possibly)"
Maybe a different situation but I also would sleep 16 hours in a day and I got put on Ardmodafinil
It’s been absolutely life changing
"Highest dose (200mg) and it’s been amazing, I now sleep 9 hours a night and wake up actually feeling awake"
"If you don’t already have a psychiatrist I would get one and request to try that medication, it’s honestly changed my life"
Before I felt like all I did was sleep and work but now I have 6 more hours every single day to actually be a person
Not sure if this will help but hoping you’ll get it worked out! I know how miserable it is living like that
This is a large part of why I haven't gotten an associates degree despite ten years of trying.
"I am very dehydrated, regardless of how much water I drink.

I try to avoid caffeine altogether because it actually puts me to sleep extremely quickly.

I get basically no exercise ever, because just walking from my bed to my door makes me breathe heavily like I just did a 200m dash.

I do have a rigid sleep schedule enforced by my automated pillbox.

I don't and can't nap during the day.

I take my methylphenidate at 6 am every day.

I have no reason to use alcohol, and I don't even like it for the most part.

Chances are I am just severely depressed, but it only shows in my energy level as my mood is very positive (unless someone pisses me off)."
I feel your pain OP and this is a good list to follow
"The exercise and hydration components seem to help me the most, but it's still a struggle."
"I do have both central and obstructive apnea, and am being treated with a CPAP"
"No anemia, and vitamin levels are normal."
"Yes, I'm currently on extended release methylphenidate, which I had to start coming off of Vyvanse because of an unrelated issue, and I find it to be far less effective than the Vyvanse."
"I already know that caffeine can have a paradoxically sedative effect on people with ADHD, which is why I specifically picked the generic of 5-Hour Energy that has only as much caffeine as 8 oz of coffee, but a heavy emphasis on B complex vitamins."
"Hmmm...ok! I'm already working with a sleep specialist and being treated for central and obstructive sleep apnea with a CPAP, but I have not yet had the MSLT done."
RIGHT??? Sleep is life
I don’t know what else to say.
"On the weekends when I don't have anything going on, I can easily sleep 14 plus hours a day and still wake up exhausted."
I can't afford to get any less sleep than I do because I'd have to drop out of school yet again and delay starting my career yet again
I want to start a career before I need to retire
😭
I'm certain depression and burnout are at the very least part of the problem
"Especially since I've been in college for literally the last 10 years trying to get anything done, and yet I'm still only about halfway towards an associates degree that should take two years."
"Yes, a few times"
"It's been confirmed each time that I have sleep apnea, and I use a CPAP for it"
Still doesn't help.
If I did that my parents and all of my doctors would lecture me that I'm slowly giving myself heart failure or something.
"The funny thing is, I'm already implementing everything you say here"
"I have a very rigid sleep schedule, enforced by the automatic pill box that I have so that I remember to take my meds on time, and I make sure to avoid stimulants of any kind after 3:00 p.m.

It's almost like there's not enough sleep in my sleep, if that makes any sense."
"I have talked to my doctor, and they aren't sure what's going on"
"I know that energy drinks that contain large amounts of B vitamins, but especially focus on B vitamins instead of caffeine, are what works for me"
My mom has recommended I investigate some kind of magnesium supplement.
I'm doing absolutely no exercise
"Mostly because doing as much as walking from my apartment to the laundry room is extremely exhausting, it makes me pant like I just got done running a marathon."
You should probably see a doctor about the out of breath thing friend
Sounds like there may be something else going on
Blood work would be a good place to start
"I came here to suggest strength training, vitamins and higher protein as it helped with my energy but you should def get some medical advice before starting anything"
Do you get cold frequently or lightheaded? That may indicate low iron.
">I get basically no exercise ever, because just walking from my bed to my door makes me breathe heavily like I just did a 200m dash.

This is almost certainly both the core of your issue, and also it's wild to me that you said it as a casual aside"
This is a **big problem**
"Like, potentially deadly or majorly (20-30 years) life shortening level problem"
"

The water thing is honestly a huge issue as well, and would warrant a doctor trip on its own"
"But with the no exercise and shortness of breath from normal movement? It's just gravy.

You need to see a doctor and start getting some low intensity exercise in asap."
The getting out of breath thing sounds like me a couple months ago before getting my iron infusions
"I had low vitamin D and was anemic, taking care of those things has helped so so much!! Go get your blood work done and make sure everything there is good!"
I also felt dehydrated no matter how much water I drank
I started adding a hydration packet to a couple of my bottles of water during the day and it was the biggest improvement to how I felt physically
Have you given them a try? I use Nectar ones usually but have tried a bunch.
I strongly and urgently recommend seeing a doctor! There's a very high possibility you're suffering from myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME)
The ADHD symptoms will enhance the negative effects in this case
I wish you the best of luck!
Came here to talk about hydration as well
Particularly low potassium
"Processed foods high in sodium cause our bodies to push out excess sodium, taking potassium with it"
"Potassium is found in lots of fresh fruits and veggies, but I eat poorly and really struggled before I sorted out my potassium 

Also,anyone drinking high dose vitamins needs to water badly"
All the caffeine is also a diuretic
"Plus, just the act of drinking such tiny beverages, makes me think he's still thirsty"
CPAP or ASV? CPAP isn't good for central apnoea
"Have you been keeping an eye on the data from the machine through OSCAR to make sure you're not still getting problems like flow limitations? Having a low AHI/RDI reported from the machine doesn't always mean it's working, you can still have residual issues that aren't highlighted via that metric"
"if you’re unopposed to amphetamine salts, adderall instant release may be the extra kick w caffeine that u need to get up n moving"
"i find neither to be very stimulating on their own, caffeine or adderall, but taken together in the morning it gives me the heartbeat AND focus to get my day started"
"it makes me a much more directable force than just caffeine, which solo makes me sweaty and annoyed."
I cut it out completely
Quiting cost some serious willpower
Now my energy levels are way more balanced and consistent throughout the day.
"Pretty sure B vitamins give you ""energy"" to do tasks that require it, like exercise"
It's not going to do much to help you focus IMO
"Regardless, get some blood work done and see a doctor perhaps?"
"Where did I say get less sleep? All these chemicals are making the sleep you do get worthless and making it super hard to get out of bed.

Also if you're on stimulants you shouldn't be taking ANY caffeine."
"How long have you been using it?

All other bloodwork checking out okay? Iron? Thyroid (free t3, t4 not just tsh) 
Electrolytes and vitamins?


You know I am diabetic and felt like this until I started using GLP medications and it felt like something that was missing snapped into place"
"Lucky for me, I don't speak to anyone in my family and I don't have a doctor currently."
It absolutely makes sense and there can be a lot of reasons for that
"For example, CPAP machines exist to help people that have airflow problems during their sleep"
Breathing interruptions can make your sleep much less efficient and restorative than it otherwise would be
"

That's just an example though"
There are plenty of other ways your sleep might not be giving you as much bang for your buck - or..
hour I guess - as it should be
The best way to get to the bottom of it is to talk to your doctor and perhaps see a specialist.
"Nah, I'd rather go for the supplements than the energy drinks 😉 
Also, I had seen a video where a doctor(?) didn't say directly that ADHD is made up, but indirectly 🤦‍♂️ and the tl;dr of the video was basically: vitamin B(6 IIRC), magnesium, and potassium are in shortage, hence the symptoms 🙄 me being who I am thought ""what daheck, what could possibly go wrong, right?!"" So I started taking those on a regular basis, and I feel better, that is - less tired and exhausted."
"I don't get cold or lightheaded, and my iron is normal."
"In high school I was on the track team and I could run a 400m dash (with difficulty), and that was after I had just finished cancer treatment.

My metabolism is broken."
"You know, I should mention that to my doctor as well, maybe ask if they can add an iron check"
"I'm already taking vitamin D supplements, so my vitamin D levels should be relatively normal."
"Yeah, any kind of flavor packet that I can add to water both makes it interesting enough for me to want to drink and makes it feel more satisfying"
Hashimoto's runs in my family so I'm going to get that tested first.
"It's a CPAP, which I think my doctor chose because I do snore quite a bit, but I also have central apnea to some extent because I do occasionally stop breathing as if my brain just forgets to remind me to breathe"
"Vyvanse, which was very effective while I was on it, is basically just Adderall with an extra ""protecting group"" tacked onto the molecule to make it last longer, so I can confirm that amphetamine based medications do work for me."
I can agree with this
It’s the only way I can function.
Are there any energy drinks that have all the ingredients of 5-Hour Energy except caffeine?
Maybe the effect I'm experiencing is just a potent placebo effect?
Ah
"I extrapolated from what other people have told me about how getting too much sleep can be worse than not enough, and that 12+ hours a day is almost twice as much as what I should get."
"About three years.

All other blood work is normal, but I haven't had an exhaustive thyroid panel done yet"
Mom has Hashimoto's so that might be part of the answer.
Interesting
"Even though I'm with you in rolling my eyes at how that doctor seems to have dismissed the existence of adhd, I'm also with you in being curious about supplementing B6, magnesium, and potassium"
"

Is there any specific form of magnesium that this guy recommended? My mom has recommended both for and against different types of magnesium, specifically she cautions against magnesium citrate because that'll give me the runs, but I think she said she found magnesium glycinate to be more effective."
Weird
I would def ask the doctor about the out of breath thing that’s odd.
What I do is put on an entertaining 10-15 minute YouTube video and just walk in place until it's over
I also watch powerlifting motivational videos as they help me get that mindset ready to exercise
"Im also very glad your cancer treatment is completed, wishing you the best man!"
"I'm playing it safe here, you might know this and just have been making a joke.

Your metabolism is not the health issue I'm worried about when it comes to you being out of breath"
"While I *hope* it's not the case, that can absolutely be a sign of your cardiovascular system failing, and **it will either kill you or shorten your life by decades**.

Please see a doctor"
Especially since you're a cancer survivor.
No idea
"I stay away from energy drinks, juices and sodas"
It's all water and tea for me.
"Possibly, placebo is very strong"
I too have struggled with a situation similar to yours and it still is hard to manage but trial and error and talking with my doctors to change things has helped
You might have to advocate for yourself but I wish you luck friend!
Well..
12 hours is a shitload of sleep
8-9 is more typical
But again if you're sleeping that much all the energy drinks on top of stinulants may be part of it because you're not actually resting properly
"Also could be depression.

At this point we're well past the point where reddit can help, you should really be discussing all of this with your doctor"
Though I'm 100% sure he will tell you no more energy drinks while on stimulants.
Ahaa.
would definitely chase that down
A lot of doctors will start with just TSH so try to get one who will run the full panel and also test for hashis
"> Is there any specific form of magnesium that this guy recommended? 

No"
"What I found out on my own, though, is that supplements containing magnesium oxide should be skipped"
"I've now been using dissolvable tablets containing magnesium carbonate, which should be better absorbed by the body."
"I've already been tested several times for cardiovascular problems, with echocardiograms and EKGs, and several times the doctors have confirmed that there are no abnormalities in my cardiopulmonary system"
Thats great! Then I guess it's time to start taking your cardiovascular health seriously
"If you can't sleep, and you get so little exercise indoor walking gets you out of breath, I'm afraid that your only real option is to start increasing bit by bit with low intensity"
"(not a doctor) while reducing caffeine.

If you still feel exhausted after a couple months getting to a healthier active baseline (\~4-5k steps a day) then I would return to the doctor again specifically for the sleep issue"
"If you go now, and are honest about the exercise, they'll probably just say the same thing I did."
That's what I will try then
"I will try doing as much exercise as I can currently tolerate, and keep doing that until it becomes easy enough for me to attempt more."
Godspeed
I know it sucks ass
"Exercise was what was causing a lot of my sleep and energy issues as well (it's how I have a good guess what doctors will ask).

Everyone works a little different, but I found it easiest to keep up by getting one of those alarm apps that makes me do squats to stop it (alarmy), I printed the [Darebee ""I am up"" Bathroom friendly stretch guide](https://darebee.com/workouts/i-am-up-workout.html) which I do during my morning and evening getting ready routine, and I have a walking pad.

Generally the idea is that the fewer obstacles to exercise, the less likely executive dysfunction is to interfere with it"
I highly recommend looking through the darebee site if you need a place to start.
"Since I currently spend the vast majority of my time at my PC either trying to do homework or screwing around, I could set up some kind of system that makes my computer make itself unavailable when I need to take a break, and it doesn't unlock itself until say 20 minutes after I have gotten up and walked away."

What do I do now?

There’s no order and all the bees are buzzing around in chaos and they’re MAD”
"

What the psychologist who diagnosed me said was that the DSM-5 just hasn’t kept pace with how rapidly our findings on ADHD are updating"
"The thing only gets updated every so many decades, meanwhile ADHD is currently the most researched condition"
"The DSM-5 also only includes quantifiable data, like cognitive impairment and frontal lobe variances, which leaves out many emotional symptoms, like emotional regulation, RSD, etc"
"So take to heart, it’s not that the diagnosis is “wrong” it’s just trying to put a common, understandable term on something that is barely understood"
"From what I was told, the name will probably change again soon if international psychological conferences get their way"
There is a big push to rename it “Regulation disorder” - because that covers all the “types” of ADHD and how they present more accurately.
I like this idea also!😆 I had to focus just trying to write this post smh.

I’m 21 from the US
I saw a psychiatrist for anti depressants to start with and I got put on Wellbutrin because regular antidepressants with serotonin didn’t work well for me
"Because of this, my therapist and psychiatrist agreed on testing me for ADHD because of the improvements I made on Wellbutrin and how it affected my day to day, as well as my therapist seeing how my anxiety and depression symptoms rooted from being undiagnosed"
They did my test from the DSM-5 and it took about two session specifically for testing to get a proper diagnosis
"If you truly think you have it, definitely get tested for it because it could change your life but if you think you only have little symptoms that could be baseline for everyone, I would save the money and hassle"
You’re still young so I would say get tested early because if I did I’d be sooo much better in school.
"Thank you so much, yeah I would definitely go test it"

Can’t get back into taking meds

🥲 sounds too home for me
"Wow! this sound exactly like me even the same job! I'm currently taking Strattera, and it has been a huge help"
"I would also suggest some YouTube podcasts and reading a book or 2 about Adhd explaining exactly what is happening in our brains when we experience these ""glitches"" or when our brains decide to hijack themselves"
The understanding gave me a deeper awareness to at least try and address each symptom

Hi! What really works for me is listening to a podcast or drawing/painting
It doesn’t have to be perfect
I love sketching things and people that I see around or just create something dumb like a frog reading 😅
"I know it’s hard to quit social media,  it it really feels great once you’ve done it"
I also try to do sport and walk around the neighborhood
Hope it helps!
Hi
"You should really exercise, and I can't stress this enough"
"If you don't have the energy for a particular day, go for a walk or multiple walks per day if you can"
The ADHD brain recharges itself with regular exercise and being outside if possible.
"Hi OP, I think you're me? Except I'm 35 and I developed the habit of doom scrolling relatively recently"
"That said looking back I've always done something else that makes me feel good right now instead of focusing on what really matters.

* Play fruit ninja to beat my high score until 3am the day before an exam in grad school.
* Not study something cos it was boring instead study again and again what I've enjoyed and probably already know.
* Put away important but boring parts of my job just cos it doesn't feel exciting.

During covid, when I had a lot of downtime socially, and WFH meant no commute time and can take 40 min 💩"
Ofc the actual task was only 10 mins
Rest was doom scrolling until I couldn't feel my legs
"

Please do this now before you destroy your personal life like I have:


1"
"Delete your social media accounts.
2"
"Add timers to the apps you need but don't wanna spend a lot of time on.
3"
"For books, I have recently begun this, but I got a local library membership and they have thousands of free audiobooks to checkout, and since you're already in school, you probably have even more on all the topics in this world"
Begin with short audio books that will help you
"I find books read in soothing voice helps me focus so much better at work.
4"
Put your phone in another room
"I do this by fluke at times and because it's out of sight, it's out of mind and I'm not reaching for it every minute"
"


Feel free to reach out for any other ideas"
"

You got this"
I got this
We all got this
Cos what else we going to do? 🤣
"I run an app called ""screen zen"" that allows you to set time limits, open limits, and other things for apps you select on your phone"
" It's free, and it works.

I have benefited.immensly from the setting that makes me wait 7 seconds before choosing to open Reddit or whatever"
It keeps me from using it when I should be doing other things by blunting the initial impulse.
Something that helps me is doing something I enjoy that requires me to also be busy with my hands and other senses
" Two things I like are baking or cooking,  or building those little fake Lego sets I get online  (they are smaller and cheaper!)  Because I need to sort of concentrate on each thing I need to do them without my phone as I am either cutting/chopping stirring or building.."
" Both of these things are not a big project,  when I bake I get a finished product in a few hours, and the little sets can be anywhere from a few hours to no more than 2-3 days so I can finish them and feel accoplished."
Try deleting the apps off your phone
Set a time of day or a set of rules when you can log in to your social media using your phone's browser
That makes apps less accessible
One day I checked my screen time and was flabbergasted.
"Maybe I should keep crayons and a coloring book within reach and keep the phone far out of reach! I can’t even successfully draw a stick figure and my perfectionist brain won’t let me sketch, but coloring or painting may work. "
I am a workout fiend (to the point it can be a hyperfocus 😬)
I generally do about an hour of resistance training 6 days a week and supplement with walking and barre
I do try to go outside a few times throughout my work day (I work from home)
I should have included that I struggle to the opposite effect
"I can’t stop and do nothing, that’s what keeps me doomscrolling. "
All of this is painfully relatable! I need to put the phone away
"Deleting the apps sounds freeing, I’m not sure I’m there yet but maybe one at a time 🤣"
I love this idea
Going to try it out.
Do it cold turkey
First few months I would still install fb occasionally cos I was bored
Now I get my fix on reddit
"Well technically, I'm very new to reddit"
But I am on the blind app a lot
It's the social media app for tech workers
At least I learn something instead of mindlessly scrolling videos
"

Also find a YouTube playlist, a meditation chanting, gospel, prayers whatever you find brings you to a spiritually calm place"
I'm not talking about religion
So you could still find something that soothes you
It really helps get me going
Today I got a block and just couldn't get working
"I knew if I turned the playlist on, I'd be good"
I resisted but then gave in
Knocked out a ton of work in 2 hours

Paralysis?

I also suffer from ADHD and for me it has been an excellent career
"Constant variety, the competitive element keeps me engaged, and you can make a lot of money"
"You’re not tied to your desk, you’re not doing the same boring thing over and over"
The thing I’m not good at in business are the little things like completing my time cards and expense reports
"So don’t let those get behind, but selling is really fun"
Thanks for sharing! I actually work as an admin assistant currently (albeit with some performance issues…) so hopefully I’d be able to keep up with the admin side of things okay! This is really helpful :)

what are some ways you’ve been embracing your adhd?
Thank you so much for this post
I was just seeking advice because I'm having a tendency of using the diagnosis as an excuse for when I feel awkward or I miss the mark
I've been struggling
"But this was an answer so, thank you."
Accept it
Understand the limitations and work with them
"

For example, ADHD results in poor working memory"
"So, I take lots of notes all the time"
"I told my family about this limitation, so they know about it as well and try to help me when they can"
"And if there is any discrepancy in recollecting any information, I give the benefit of doubt to others.

Another example, ADHD makes me appear emotionally detached"
My wife hates that about me but it is what it is
"My siblings and parents have come around to accept it as well.

When the expectations are set clearly up front, there is less scope for misunderstanding and conflict."

I just started medication at 22 and procrastination has been something I’ve done my entire life
"The only reason I started is because I’m an adult and I’m multi tasking a lot, school, full time work, I also live on my own so just regular day to day stuff, and I put a lot off and I’m not getting what I need to do in a day done.

That being said, (before I was medicated) and I was in school, and only school, or, when I was working full time and only had work to focus on"
Something I did was give myself a small break in between long sessions of high focus activities
It made my mind kind of refresh
The con to this is my breaks would sometimes turn into a hyper fixation on something else and I would spend all my time doing something else rather than what needed to be done
"But with some self awareness, it can be a good tool.

Other than that, I really don’t have any other advice on procrastination, I’m a tier 1 procrastinator"
"Maybe give yourself a deadline that’s sooner than your real deadline, I’ve done that many times and it worked out well"
"

Sorry if that doesn’t seem very helpful, but that’s just my experience with my battle of procrastination."
"Medication helped, CBT did not so much it just created a pressure which I know wasn't the intention but it did"
"

Meds just help shorten the length of time I procrastinate, and I even break down tasks now"
"I dare too ""sit down"" for a pause and know I will get back up and carry on because when I do something, it's at a high level of intensity"
"Prior to medication, if I sit down, the day was over 😂"
"Otherwise, channeling that sense of urgency to get stuff done is the key"
"Sometimes, I'd message friends and invite them over, even if I knew they were busy"
After asking I would put my phone down and do what i need to do cleaning and chores because I have the sense I'm expecting someone even if I know they'll probably have something else on there's a slight chance they'll say yes
"If I don't check my messages until it's done, then I don't know any better"
"Worked well, still works pretty well"
With other things like work I need a quiet room I always sit in the corner and crack on once the momentum gets going people remind me to take my breaks 😂😂
Whats helpful for me is not even trying to do anything for a long time
"I put in a lot of 5 minute breaks where i give myself and my mind freedom to do or think of whatever i want to/ is interesting

Like, 10 or 20 minutes (if you can do it) of concentrated effort on the topic/task at hand, then 5 minutes of freedom.

This way tasks become a lot more bearable instead of dreading the drudgery, so I procrastinate less as  well

Hope this helps!"

I just realized the paradox of being sensitive to noises while being regarded as the unruly kid that makes too much noise
"

As for your question:

- Seating the student in an area with fewer distractions where he or she can focus on the lesson"
"For example, near the teacher’s desk, away from windows and the doorway, or in another area that has few distractions.

- Seating the student next to positive role models, peers who are less likely to provide distractions and can help them stay on task.

- Allowing them to take tests in a different room, one that is quiet and has few distractions"
"Or using aids such as headphones or privacy boards to create quiet spaces in the classroom.

- Provide opportunities for other students to see them in a positive light"
"You might ask the student to help you with a task or give him or her a leadership role in the classroom for a day―anything to help the student feel connected to the classroom and the school.

"It sounds like you aren't working, and the first change I would make is obtaining some employment to help rekindle your socialization skills, and give you some purpose day-to-day regardless of the job.

Socialization is like riding a bike"
"If you learned to ride a bike and stopped doing it for a period of time, we lose the small motor skills and habits we had when we regularly rode which can make it feel scary"
"If we keep riding through the uncomfortable period, those little skills will come back until we feel confident riding a bike once more.

Having a job and a wage also cultivates goals to work towards that ultimately helps with our sense of purpose.

"as I got older, my coping mechanisms stopped working as well as they used to, so I feel like meds are what actually allow me to be myself again."
Should a cancer patient feel shame for wearing a wig? You don't feel shame for trying to compensate for something you cannot control or fix.
Nah
I love overclocking my brain
It feels good
Everything runs smooth.
I dont feel like I'm not me.  I just feel like all the barriers have been taken down and I can now be the best of me.
Honestly I get so depressed without my vyvanse I’d def kms if I didn’t have it
"I’m not taking it to be like everyone else, I’m taking it to stay alive lol."
"My old self is miserable 24/7, I prefer to be on my meds as I wonder is this how everyone else feels? Just feeling content?"
"When you get your brakes fixed on your car, do you feel like your “old car” is judging you when you don’t crash into things?

Sorry for being cheeky, but adhd is a disability"
"There should be no shame in getting help for your difficulties, and no one should tell you that those difficulties are the “real you.” We all deserve the same level of opportunity and comfort."
"I absolutely get what you’re saying because I feel that way too, but I also think you need to look at it more clinically"
"If you broke a bone, you’d get a cast that would repair that injury back to what it should be"
"If you got cut, you get stitches to repair that skin back to what it’s supposed to be"
"If you’re diabetic, you take insulin to correct your bodily chemicals to be at the appropriate levels they should be"
Mental variations are no different but get such a worse stigma
"

Getting medicated actually gave me a serious sense of relief"
"I went from feeling like not being impulsive, focusing, being “lazy” was something to be ashamed of, that I should be able to just get over with will power and that it’s MY FAULT for not trying hard enough"
That I was suffering from depression because I didn’t try hard enough to be happy
"Now being medicated, I don’t feel like it has changed who I am, but rather it’s removing the impediments that kept me from being myself"
" My body needs more serotonin than it can produce naturally, so I take extra and that’s totally ok."
My old self was a mess
"I deserve to not be struggling, damnit."
I feel this sentiment very strongly
"I was diagnosed in adulthood, after many things had failed, including my job and marriage"
"I sometimes think that if I had been diagnosed as a child, before I experienced major setbacks, I might have had a different self-image."
Adhd is a struggling mental illness
It's not a personality trait or peculiar quirk that makes me special and unique
"I don't want to be like everyone else, I wanna be able to start and finish my shit and have some mental clarity"
"

I truly have grown to hate these kinds of posts."
Have you seen The Substance? I feel like that
And I am sort of worried it will end similarly.
You'll never be like everyone else
"None of us will.

So why the shame?"
"I have adhd inattentive type, meaning my whole unmedicated life was living with a mask on"
Stims actually allow me to express more of my inner self without fear of social repercussions.
"As someone who got diagnosed late in life, no"
I spent a majority of my life self-medicating by abusing drugs and alcohol to cope
Being medicated and diagnosed has helped me move forward with my life
"I’ve never felt normal a day in my life, but being properly medicated helps me feel a sense of control and a sense of safety I never had before"
What you are describing is kind of how I felt most of my life trying to fit in.
"Not at all, I feel like I get to be a better version of myself that I like much more, because I'm far more able to follow through on what I want to do and how I want to act"
My unmedicated self feels like there's a goblin in my head overriding my actual intentions and wants.
I don't feel like I'm cheating on myself
"Medication doesn't perform miracles, and the lowest working dosage is usually the best dosage"
I have a love/hate relationship with my ADHD
It's given me success and an ability to always land on my feet
"That being said, it has also caused problems for me -- espescially while growing up."
"no, I'm better in every way and my ""old self"" is happy, very happy because he's seen me blossom as he always knew"
"Not at all, someone with asthma doesn't take an inhaler to be like everyone else, they take it because they require it to function"
"Same thing for someone that uses medication for their heart condition, kidney condition or for mental conditions like our ADHD"
"Why would you be ashamed for this? You need them to function so you should take them, like the millions of people that require medication just like we do."
yep
"My meds make me nowhere near ""normal"", 
I also dont feel that different, its not like im a diffrent person when i take my meds, actually quite the opposite, sometimes when i dont take them i get so overwhelmed/ unfocussed i cant even answer a simple question or choose what to eat for dinner, that's when i feel not like me.

Also OP, did you start meds at a young age?"
"Treating my ADHD had brought out my previously well hidden (undiagnosed but highly highly likely) autism, which causes a new set of imposter syndrome symptoms, but I also feel like I’m more myself, with less fear/anxiety I’m letting everyone down"
Adderall me LOVES THE SHIT out of regular me!! “He” KNOWS how hard regular me is TRYING and wants to HELP! We are a team
"He knows who I am and I know who he is and we are a PACKAGED DEAL! 

Regular me is the only me that be beating myself over stuff I can’t control.

Let it go"
Accept yourself
"And most importantly, love yourself"
"I know I do when my mind is working how it’s supposed to! 

Only love and goodness to follow OP today"
Sending only positive vibes your way and wishing only growth and abundance for your coming week.
"I do not feel like a different person or that I’m somehow disguised as a “normal person.”
If anything, it helps me be more myself rather than constantly trying to mask the mess I feel inside"
"Masking is still a thing I have to do to adapt to the world, but taking meds cuts down on some of that work"
"

Besides, I already struggle with other learning disabilities that I also have to work around; I use aids for those, too"
 Taking medication is also an aid.
I don't feel different at all on my ADHD meds
I literally just feel stupid without it
Medicated me is just me who remembers why she walked into a room and can find her phone.
"I've been on meds for over five years, at this point I feel like the opposite, in a way"
"Going off your comparisons, my medicated self feels like my normal self, who I've always meant to be"
"I don't feel like I'm under the influence of my meds, it's just unveiling ""me"" from behind the curtain of dysfunction"
"My ""old self"" isn't watching me, it feels more like my medicated self was the one watching me back then, wishing to come out.

Getting diagnosed with adhd can be really tough because you end up thinking about so many things, the past, why we do certain things or why we feel how we do"
"For me, the best thing was to start working to the future, recognize my difficulties and what I can do to help myself, and know that there are different ways to go that (including meds)"
Yes
Everything I've accomplished must be because I tricked someone or myself or I'm just an addict who tricked people into having ADHD and needing meds but really I'm just doping
"Everything I failed at I failed at because I *am* a failure.

It helps to rationally know it's not true, but the feeling never really goes away"
^ This..
"Being medicated, doesn't make me a different person"
"It gives me the help I need to function in a society that was not designed for me, and where being unable to function within the space I occupy, can have severe consequences for my existence"
"Things like unemployment, homelessness, mental and physical health crisis, financial issues and social conflicts, are all things that I have to work a lot harder to avoid when I don't have that help.."
"Sure, a beautiful goal is to somehow manage to create the circumstances that allow me to function in a healthy and safe way while unmedicated.."
"But I don't have those circumstances yet, right now I just have a job I love and want to keep, bills I need to pay and a cat that deserves to be fed, and I don't have the resources or safety net to provide the help I would need to achieve the same quality of life without the meds.."
"

It really is no different than providing people who are hard of hearing with hearing aids or giving people with mobility issues with the proper tools to allow them to navigate the world under their own power..."
Same ! Before medications I felt like I never was Really myselfbut now im the best me i've ever been
Exactly this.
Same!
Best me to it by 8 hours
Damn West Coast time.
Exactly this
I take meds for high blood pressure and I couldn’t care less
I also take meds for adhd
They work and popping a pill once a day is of no concern to me
A lot of comments in this group are by people who let adhd own them.
SAME
"Thank you for all your answers, in fact taking this medication is like putting on corrective glasses for a visually impaired person, or for a diabetic taking their bad insulin, we should not stigmatize ourselves so much for my part it is thanks to this stimulating treatment that I was able to stop alcoholism, tagasime, drugs, addiction to anxiolytics, and resume my studies at 24 to pass my baccalaureate, it's never too late and your comments in response to mine remind me of usefulness of the treatment, which I sometimes tend to forget, and also to self-stigmatize it."
Do you get withdrawals though? Generally our stimulants are at doses a tweaker would laugh at
They'd finish our month's worth in an hour
"Personally I don't feel any withdrawal at these levels, so I don't consider myself an addict"
"An addict doesn't have a problem remembering to take his drug like so many of us do! Sometimes I'll forget and my husband will go 'hey, are you okay?' and I'm like 'wtf yes I'M FINE why would you even ask me that weirdo? ....ohhhh wait, I forgot my pills this morning..."
"Lol brb' I can't tell until my inattentive-type propensity to nap all day kicks in around noon, but he can just look at my face and see that I'm unmedicated.."
An addict wouldn't have to have other people remind them to take their drug.
I wish it didn’t affect my personality so much ngl
"It helps a lot but man I just feel so antisocial and like a zombie on it some days, I always eat before I take it and drink lots of water, I’m not sure why other than brain chemistry maybe"
"Well, honestly? I was diagnosed in my 30s"
"In my 20s, I did amphetamines illegally, often taking too much, because I didn't realize I'm self medicating and that there's a more sensible way to treat my issues"
"

Now I don't take as much"
"I'm also not prescribed amphetamines, but atomoxetine and methylphenidate (easier to be prescribed that than amphetamines in Europe)"
"

Sometimes we can be addicted to something *and* legitimately need those substances"
"Having used frugs liked that and having been labelled an addict just makes me hate myself more and impostor syndrome harder.

I also never forget to take my stimulants (unless I leave the house without taking them with me or something)"
The Atomoxetine I forget sometimes
But not the stimulants
"The effect kicks in almost immediately, no way I'd forget that."
I didn't feel like it affected my personality to get on the meds..
"It slowed me down a little, gave me time to process and allowed me control of myself and my impulses, that I had otherwise only been barely controlling with some serious masking, and I've spent months in my therapist's office unravelling that.."
"

So maybe it's wrong to say that it hasn't affected my personality, it just hasn't made me feel negatively 'altered', if that makes sense? Instead, it has allowed me to start unmasking and getting to know who I am without this mask that I don't even remember when I started wearing, and without blowing up my life in the process.."
But I meant it when I wrote that it would be beautiful to create for myself the circumstances I'd need to function safely and healthily without the medication
"I am not inherently disabled by my ADHD, but by the society that wasn't designed to make space and give grace to people like me..."

"Hey! Firstly, I feel your frustration and I'm proud of you for taking this step to seek a private diagnosis"
I went the same route
On the NHS waiting list for 4 years after a decade of suspecting ADHD
The NHS waiting list is never ending and I had almost lost all hope
Going private felt like the only option
"And it was the best thing I've ever invested in.

To answer your questions:

1) I personally have not applied for any reasonable adjustments as of yet, and I'm not sure I intend to"
Medication has helped beyond belief (even though I am still in the titration phase) - so much so that I am feeling much more functional at work and with my other commitments
"In a way, I don't think I will need to even apply for reasonable adjustments at this rate"
"That being said, everyone is different"
It feels as though a company/university must respect a private diagnosis as much as a NHS one since the diagnosis is recognised and has been carried out by a lisenced provider
"If there were to be any push back from the company/university then I think you'd have a case there.

2) For I months supply  (28 days) of Elvanse (Lisdexamphetamine), I pay between £80 - £95"
It gets delivered to my home address (no extra charge)
"Something to consider though it when you begin titration, your provider will want to see you probably monthly to check how the medication is working for you"
"Those appointments are mandatory for them to refill your script, and can go up to the £300+ mark (depending on provider)"
"After you have stabilised on the medication, which may take some months, your psychiatrist/provider will contact your GP to ask to get you on a joint care agreement"
"You will have to continue to purchase the medication privately, but your NHS GP will then take over any check up/follow up appointments you might need, which cuts the cost a lot.

  
3) Can't say for myself but would be keen to hear other's answers! I want to pursue this soon"
My psychiatrist has encouraged me to chase my NHS referral (to get another \~NHS\~ ADHD diagnosis) so that they can take on full care plus medication supply
"I would say check the cost and obligation of any follow up appointments with your chosen private provider, to make sure you brace yourself for the costs while titrating on meds.

Good luck and feel free to dm me if you want!"
You can get a diagnosis with a private provider through the NHS using Patient's Right to Choose
This way your meds will definitely be covered by the NHS
"It might still be too long of a wait for what you need.

This website is run by the charity ADHD UK, and has a detailed explanation of the process as well as the current wait time of each provider:

https://adhduk.co.uk/right-to-choose/"
The NHS will never diagnose you
The NHS ADHD diagnoses process will drag on forever punctuated every three years with a meeting with someone who doesn't even know what ADHD is
" 
I was diagnosed too long ago to comment on the price, but once I had the diagnoses I went to my NHS GP and had them fill out the prescription."
"For me: 

1) No negative impact on support from work (and work at a uni: it would be the same for our students)"
"In fact, I don’t think they have anyway of knowing how I was diagnosed without me disclosing that"
"But regardless: a professional private diagnosis is as legitimate as any other kind of professional diagnosis.

2) For what I take (Elvanse slow release and a quick release top up) it’s around £130 a month.

3) Moving onto shared care now, and GP has no problem with it and has been v helpful so far.

Hope that’s some help! It is an expensive process and I wish the NHS was better able and supported to get diagnoses through quicker"
I appreciate how lucky I am to be able to go private
"I’ve never had private treatment before, and it was a more than noticeable hit to my finances"
"The results of medication, though, have also been priceless"
"I have no regrets at all; though I appreciate we all have our own circumstances, limits and considerations to weigh"
Lots of luck to you!

Lots of luck to you!
"This is really helpful, thank you so much for taking the time to reply! Re the monthly appointments, are you saying that you paid £300+ every month for the appointments until you were stabilised? How long did that take? The price lists for the provider I am looking at has “follow up appointment” as £225 - is that likely to be these appointments? 

They do a free consultation so I think I will book one of those before I commit to anything, I’m sure they’ll be able to answer my questions re pricing"
"

When you first started with the meds, did you have a period of adjustment where it negatively affected you until you got used to it? I’m thinking because I have these exams coming up (they’re not for around 8 months but still need to be very productive until then with study) I wondered if starting on medication just before my exams is potentially a bad idea ? Or did you feel like the started helping you quite quickly?"
"Adding to your helpful post: despite the website being run by ADHD UK, the Right to Choose Option described is only for patients in England"
" Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales have different processes."
"For the monthly appointments - these are basically med reviews, scheduled in as 30 min appointments every 4 weeks while I stabilise on meds"
This is still on ongoing process as I onyl started meds around 6 weeks ago
There was '3 months' flying around but I've forgotten (lol) if they said there was any specific length of time/amount of appointments I'd need
"Depends as well if you need to keep switching your meds or amount.

Free consultation sounds great, then you can ask them about the whole process and what sort of commitment you would need to make after a diagnosis if you decide to go down the medication route.

In terms of adjusting to the medication - I felt the positive effects straight away (focus, clarity, increased confidence and lowered anixety)"
"The first 3, maybe 4 days I had the classic 'elvanse crash' at around 2:30/3pm (I had taken the meds at around 7:30/8am for reference)"
"Crash is: VERY tired, brain fog, a bit anxious/worried/ruminating, low mood"
"However this only lasted around 45 mins while it got out of my system, and then I was back to my normal adhd self"
After the first few days the crash got less and less until it wasn't really noticeable at all
"Now I am moving up to 50mg I have noticed a slight crash (later on in the day, around 7pm), but not so bad at all"
Overall my functioning and quality of life have improved so much more than any negative side effects
"IMO you should be good to start meds ahead of exams, maybe give yourself some buffer room of a month or two to be sure"
You don't wanna be in the middle of a stressful period while your body adjusts to new medication
Idk if this is useful to know but the same day I was diagnosed with ADHD i was offered meds
my psych wrote the prescription the following day and I got my prescription 5 days after my assessment
so it was a quick process
"(you can choose to hold off on meds if you prefer though)

also just a note - while i personally adjusted very quickly to meds, everyone is different"
"A lot of factors go in to how wel the meds work such as eating enough protein for breakfast, avoiding vitamin C in the morning (may be an old wives tale but idk), sleeping well, and making sure not to burn yourself out when you first get this new lease of drive and focus"
"I also have ony tried lisdexamphetamine (elvanse/vyvanse), so can't speak for the other kinds including ritalin/adderall etc."
Super helpful thank you so much! Really appreciate it.

Elvanse/vyvanse makes me talkative for the first few hours

It feels normal
"

My mind races less, i feel less dread over completing tasks, i feel less urge to drink alcohol and snack to fill time, and it’s much easier to focus

EDIT: 30mg vyvanse btw"
"The first one both would react probably the same, and second time, couldn't really tell"
You can't base it of such a high dose
"If you wanna make really shady diagnosis then take 10mg, see how you feel, if nothing 20mg"
Increased attention span is normal in both but in adhd it allows us to direct our attention better and not get distracted for 2h randomly without really noticing
Overthinking is gone
It is a myth that people with adhd don't get energy and more talkative from adhd meds
I know many people say that that way you can find out if you have adhd
"The effects you are experiencing are different, one time you were productive talkative and energetic, second time you felt calm etc"
I experience both when I take my meds and I definately have adhd
Depends on the day and how the meds kick in
"Though many people without adhd or people with adhd symptoms, but not enough to have the diagnose, can have those effects too"
"Anyway, I think it sounds like you should have a second opinion, because sometimes they are wrong when diagnosing people"
Depends on how people describe their symptoms
"Some people tend to say they have severe anxiety if they are a little scared of something and some people are quite the opposite, and I think that is somewhat related to how you grew up, age etc..."
Self-controlled
Interesting
I may consider that
There are some things that makes a lot of sense
"Constant overthinking, nothing is managable, hard to focusing because my mind is 13 different places, constantly needs stimilus

I just have 2 friends who have it and when they talk about i don't relate to that extent at all"
"It could me a less intense add maybe

Thank you a lot for your response"

Are you just telling this as a story or are you asking for help and advice?
You need to tell your doctor
To take the medication like that can be dangerous and the likelihood of becoming addicted is big.
Go see addiction therapist
"Don't tell about this to your psychiatrist yet since they might or might not be sensible about the situation and what you should do - they should be able to talk you through it on what to do.

Most likely you will need to drop stimulants for a long while and swap to non-stimulants"
The longer you will delay this the harder it will be
And I promise you it can get very very hard once you get deep into the addiction process
"Fighting part of your brain that is very motivated to obtain 'the thing' is exhausting, and the smarter you are the harder the cat and mouse game will be"
"

Also - the longer you abuse stimulants the more likely you are to reduce their effectiveness and the likelihood of the awesome side effects of abusing those like paranoia and auditory hallucinations.

Go see addiction therapist - the sooner the better"
This is something that is hard to deal with even with proper support.
How long do you go without medication?
More as a story
2-3 weeks at most
"Nevertheless, stop doing it"
"It might feel good but thats only short term, Long term you're setting yourself up for a lot of trouble besides this being straight up dangerous behaviour."

How to keep track of and stick to long-term goals?

Try to look at it from a different perspective
"There's people without ADHD, who also have those qualities, and probably people with ADHD who dont have those qualities"
"And by your example, what do you mean with ""special interests""?

If it helps, I have some examples of people I know and what traits they have"
"

My boyfriend REALLY doesnt have ADHD, but he has a heightened sense/understanding of his own and other people's emotions, and is working on having less rejection sensitivity.

My mom doesnt have diagnosed ADHD, but I suspect she might have the primarily hyperactive/impulsive type"
"She doesnt have the best emotional sense/understanding (and not due to lack of trying or caring).

Two of my friends are really well-structured people and are good at doing things that arent necessarily fun, but are necessary"
"One has pretty strong symptoms of ADHD when unmedicated, and the other doesn't have it at all.

Edit to add: the two structured friends and I are all university students, and we also all still struggle from time to time."
This is a struggle im still learning to face too
Ive seen therapists and they always say to show myself kindness
Ive gotten better with it but occasionally I let some self loathing slip up but i always follow up by telling myself to be kind and i did the best i could
"

I get you feel lost"
I asked the same question of where i began and my ADHD ended
Ive masked my ADHD for the most part of my life and i wasn’t really sure how much of my genuine self was there
And i questioned again when i got medicated
But after the honeymoon phase of the medication my ADHD started to bleed through
I realized this is me whether i liked it or not
These are the cards we are dealt and we just got play with it
"

Your ADHD has always been with you and it has shaped every experience you have ever had"
Good or bad
So it is essentially is you and you are your ADHD
I like to use the psychological concept of the inner child in these situations
Where my ADHD is my inner child who carries the ADHD related traumas I experienced
I have to ask myself if i want to be the adult who yells and scrutinizes at this child that doesn’t know better but is constantly making an effort despite his adversity or do i want to be the adult I never had and build this child up
"

Be kind to yourself stranger."

I'm in my mid 30s and was only diagnosed recently
"However, I grew up in a time and a place where ADHD testing was not common and I have been plagued by the ""what ifs"".

Looking back on my life now, it's so clear that I had ADHD"
"So much suffering, so much wasted potential"
"I have self sabotaged myself out of pensions, high 6 figure salaries, and entire career paths"
"There is a lot of pain.

That being said:

You need to understand that you can't change the past"
"No amount of overthinking or extra work will change it.

You have to accept it and be grateful that you have so much life left to enjoy and tailor in a way that is true to yourself"
Don't feel guilty for struggling
"Those feelings you had and things that happened are not character flaws, they are symptoms"
"They do not define you.

Attempting to make up for lost time will almost certainly lead to burnout and begin a cycle"
"Break it before it starts.

And lastly, maintain perspective"
"Many people in life face hardships, whether those be illnesses, disease or external"
"Everyone has regrets, everyone has invisible scars"
"The people around you are not living a perfect life while you struggle; we all struggle in different ways.

You have nothing to make up for, just move forward and be kind to your past self."
"I feel you so much with this.
I too was diagnosed as an adult and before that wondered what was wrong with me, why I couldn't function like everyone else, why I struggled with life so much.
When I started with meds I also felt the same as you, it was nonstopp go go go.

But the lack of rest, pushing myself all the time and stress resulted in severe burnout 2 years after starting meds"
I was put on sick leave for 3 weeks in july and I'm still recovering
"Not only was I utterly exhausted mentally and physically all the time, I lost all joy and the most scary part was the physical symptoms, I developed irregular heartbeat, severe insomnia, my blood pressure was so low I fainted regularly and I had frequent migraine like headaches.

All of that got a lot bettet, but that was one hell of a wake up call"
"Don't make the same mistake as me, take care of yourself, rest, take time to relax and recharge.
At the beginning its hard, because you feel like you ""waste"" your meds if you don't do enough ""productive"" things in a day, but this is not true and you will get used to it.

I wish you the best."
"such a great reply :) In my experience, being kind to yourself is really hard but also the only way forward"
"Also I discovered that meds give me that amazing capability for sure, but when I remain stuck in my old ways of thinking (judging myself etc), they become less helpful"
so therapy is a great idea!

I swear it is the manufacturers
"You may have gotten one that does not agree with your body, and that is why it doesnt seem to be working, and why the 2 week break was not effective"
 I am experiencing the same
" If trying to not take adderall, would recommend taking a lower dose (like 20 or 40) on those days so you are not a complete zombie"
"Then one day maybe you can decrease your daily dose, and decrease your ""off day dose"" too"
" It is hard going from 60mg to 0mg, try something in between"
since when you’re on your meds tho? i agree that maybe u should talk to your psychiatrist to switch to another medication which might work better for u
also a blood count could give u a hint if you’re low on iron
remember that meds aren’t the solution for everything
"it should increase your ability to focus, but if you’re for example struggling with a depressive episode it can’t help that"

I dropped the hint that we should ask for ADHD assessment when I go for my autism diagnosis to my parents

Hey dude there’s nothing stopping you raising that question with the doctor assessing you.
ADHD is 80% comorbid with autism
"(Not the other way around though) 

So, yes, if you got the tism, it's very likely."
Absolutely - you will have alone time with the psych during the evaluation where your parents aren't there
Just float the idea and see what they think!
And good luck
"There's a reason a lot of us are ""AuDHD"""
"I went in for an ADHD assessment and came out with ""ADHD with suspected autism"" (they weren't specialised in autism so didn't do the full test and I have no real interest in perusing it further)"

"Appearing self,centered, any suggestions?"

\*if it works\* usually within 30-45 minutes for me
"If it doesn't work (which is often), it doesn't ever kick in and usually makes my focus worse."
Could you tell me what are the things your ADHD makes impossible to do compared to when you take Adderall?
I feel like the adderall just makes my ADHD symptoms worse lately
It did not used to do that
" I feel like my head is in a cloud when I take adderall, it is difficult to do much of anything"
I hyperfocus more on adderall.
"What about before? It may help me understand what was the things that were worsened like for example, if you play video games, where you able to see improvements like being more faster reacting? or if you study, have you being noticing a difference when studying like have you being able to not get confused when reading something or trying to complete an assignment?"
"I would say I was baseline struggling, but manageable"
 Like I would often lose focus while reading and need to reread a section; seems on adderall I am not comprehending nearly enough to even get there / am no relaxed enough ever to sit and read
" If I am hyperfocused on a video game off adderall, I can more easily tell myself okay time to move on and do something else; on adderall, I lose that ability"
"Without adderall, I find it really hard to initiate tasks and do tasks in general; this doesn't change on adderall, still hard, arguably harder as my brain is in a fog and I am hyperfocused on things that don't matter."

What do I do with my kids high Cogat test scores?

"Don't have kids, but I was your kids"
"If you can find a school that emphasizes independent study or lets them focus on their interests, with the other stuff being taught but...less...somehow? I wish I were an educator and knew the technical terms.

Barring that, realize they're probably going to struggle in school regardless"
"My experience with ""more challenging"" is that it's the same stuff every other kid gets taught, with all the same work and homework, just faster"
"For instance, I took 9th grade math in 7th grade; it was new stuff I mostly didn't know, but my grade still depended on the tedious homework I didn't need to do to learn the material.

I don't know, maybe things are different now.

In any case, if they struggle, be understanding and do what you can to get them through it"
"If they get C grades, they get C grades"
"Just keep them from failing too much while making it clear that they \_are\_ required to do as best they can, and not just blow everything off"
"At the same time, you let them study whatever they want however much they want at home"
You keep doing what you're already doing
"Make sure they gain knowledge and learn how to think and communicate.

Not much of a solution, but it's a tough situation."
"Are they in any sports?


I used to work at a daycare and one of the most unmanageable kids in my class had ADHD, but during the time of year he was in wrestling he was an absolute angel and his intelligence really shined.


On top of that, you'll find a lot of people in this subreddit that say their symptoms improve when they regularly exercise."
"Any public Montessori schools(we’ve got one) around or can afford? From what I understand they’re self-directed, allow for lots of time for running around etc."
"Hopefully, your school has a gifted program"
"Usually, the CoGAT is administered to students to determine eligibility in these programs"
"Where I worked, 99th percentile is automatic eligibility and requires no more testing. 

What do you do with them? Well, you’re probably in for it as far as parenting challenges go"
You’ve gotten some really good suggestions
Physical activity
Supporting their interests
"If it’s accessible, I’d also recommend counseling here and there, or more regularly if they seem to be struggling"
"Twice-exceptional kids (behavior/learning problem + giftedness) can find themselves really confused by the conflicting messages they get, and disheartened by their struggles when they fail to meet the high expectations that accompany giftedness. 

I was this kid and I’m parenting this kid"
All we can do is try our best and reinforce that we love and accept them. 
"As a side note, even before these results came back, I had reached out to my kids teachers"
"They're both due for re-evaluation on their IEP, and I've asked to get the ball rolling sooner rather than later, as second grade is a big change from first grade academically, in a way that's challenging for kids like mine"
I have already started the conversation about getting testing accommodations.
"""Electron VALENCE problems"
😆
I know when I was initially diagnosed with ADHD at 5 1/2 I had ADHD combined type moderate at my autism evaluation results got downgraded to primarily inattentive type mild it’s possible you child when they get older may possibly get milder
"Ya, I also don’t have kids, and while I wasn’t quite like OP’s kids, I was similar"
"I’ve never been very physically hyperactive, but my mind has always raced and wanted to jump from thing to thing to thing, learning everything I can about anything that comes across my field of vision.

I was homeschooled for my elementary school years and honestly it was perfect for exactly the reasons you mentioned"
"My mom was qualified as she was a former elementary school teacher, and we bought a whole curriculum from a ritzy private school"
"I don’t think we actually got through much of the curriculum, but when I went back to public school in middle school, I was reading at a college level and remained way ahead of most of my peers in every subject for the remainder of my academic career.

I think the big keys for my success were that my curiosity was fostered and strongly encouraged"
I was given lots of freedom to explore the things that were interesting to me and my mom found ways to direct that interest into some educational benefit.
"Basically, you can't stop the chaos, but you can direct it a little and minimize its negative impact."
"Oh, and that's also the unmedicated version"
I'd have to let someone else speak to the possibilities if they're medicated.
"Thanks for this! It's nice to have someone point out that we can increase the difficulty level and still not be bothered to push them to ""do well"" in their classes"
"Honestly, I really DGAF about their grades, other than making sure they don't become an impediment"
I just want them to be engaged and to walk away knowing they're capable
"

As a bonus, it would be great if we could develop some semblance of study skills, as I know lack of study skills and being TERRIBLE at testing has been a serious hurdle in my own life"
"Though, too be fair, it hasn't prevented me achieving my goals"
It's just made things harder and caused me to struggle with my confidence.
I cannot recommend sports highly enough
"I went undiagnosed into my 30's and I'm convinced my high activity levels are what helped me manage a lot of BIG feelings.

Sports can be frustrating too though"
I wasn't great with team sports because I wasn't into winning
I enjoyed having activity without focus if that makes sense?
We did Montessori in preschool
"It had a lot going for it, but they're was almost too much flexibility"
"That said, this was before we got them on meds"
"We've talked about moving back to Montessori, but it's private and not cheap"
"

Our current school is our neighborhood school, and we live in a fabulous community with lots of local engagement"
We like that the boys get to walk to school with their friends and feel like they're a part of something locally
"

Our elementary also has a great SPED program and an AMAZING SPED teacher, while the Montessori doesn't have any SPED resources"
"In fact, in preschool, after we got the IEP set up, the kids ended up getting bussed to a public elementary for half the day to access more resources, which left us wondering what we were paying so much money for.."
"😮‍💨

Honestly, sometimes I wonder if we need to move to a bigger city with more options"
"But we still might consider going back to the Montessori, depending on how things go the rest of this year."
"Fingers crossed! 😅
Unfortunately, my own Adhd is still quite rampant as an adult"
"I've managed to be successful anyway, but it's really not been easy."
I wish we could home school
"My husband has a background in education, and we've talked about it"
"Unfortunately, my kids definitely have the ""twin bond,"" and in manifests as an echo chamber of insanity"
"Even on meds, every time we have tried to have them in a shared classroom, things go very badly very quickly"
"

I do wonder about partial home schooling though? Basically just taking each of them out of school for a portion of time so that we can do field trips and stuff to give them more space to explore and engage their curiosity"
"Seems like that's not a done thing though, probably for good reasons..."
They're 100% medicated 😆 We had to get them on meds in kindergarten in order to keep them in school
"

One of my sons was also developing some severe anxiety and depression (at age 5!) because he could tell he wasn't meeting expectations, etc"
"He told us he was bad and nobody liked him, he couldn't ever have friends"
"He kept waking up at night with terrible dreams, crying, telling us ""I tried to build it but I couldn't"
"I just kept breaking it and breaking it and everyone was mad."" Ugh"
It broke my heart
"Thankfully, it totally evaporated when we started meds and he was able to get more self control."
"Ugh, this damned sub and its stubborn refusal to let us talk about the darker aspects of ADHD"
Removed my comment about something extremely important
"

I’ll rewrite it later to get past the automod, but I have to go cut firewood at the moment."
I have zero study skills apart from a high reading ability
I haven’t needed any for the most part
But the times I have needed to have been excruciating
"A lot of times homework is supposed to be studying, I guess, so that hurt my academic achievements in middle and high school"
"

But I could usually ace any test because I was able to pay attention in class, mostly"
"

From academic standpoint I should have just been allowed to test out of school"
"School isn’t just about academics, though, and it was important for me to socialize and learn how to be patient and otherwise interact with people"
"If my parents had let me skip grades like the school suggested, I’d be a complete mess because I was probably behind my peers emotionally, and I needed that time at school to develop."
"100%

We've trialed wrestling, but they couldn't pay attention to the instruction enough"
Teachers got frustrated with them because they were just messing around
Other kids didn't want to wrestle them because they wouldn't do the moves right
Seemed like a poor fit
"Team sports in general seem like a no go, at least right now"
"They DO want to win, and they get very angry and upset if they lose"
"Holy emotional dysregulation.

Jujitsu was a better fit, but the timing of the classes in our town ended up not working out"
"They do running club at school, but that stops in the winter"
"We've had good success with Rick climbing, but it's so expensive, and I only feel comfortable taking them when they're pretty focused"
"Right now, I'm thinking about trying to get them more involved in swimming"
"

Did any individual sports work particularly well for you?"
Finding out I have autism at 31 isn’t easy either it’s been rough parents knew at 3 1-2 never told me until now
"Ya honestly despite my having a fantastic educational experience with home school, I pretty much always recommend against it – I got the perfect situation of a qualified attentive parent, my having the exact right personality for it, and by being a child when the History Channel still aired educational content.

Idk what to do about the schooling question, but in general, foster and support their curiosity! Help them pursue the things they're interested in and that will go a really long way"
I think that accounts for 90% of the benefits I got from being homeschooled
"The reason my reading level has always been so high had nothing to do with any specific curriculum, it's because I was encouraged and validated when I read, and because I was so curious that I wanted to read everything I could find on whatever special interest I had at the time."
"Tbh when I was a kid, I tried EVERYTHING"
"I think just getting the chance to try lots of stuff was good for me too?
The one that stuck with me for years was horse riding but I know that's really unaffordable for a lot of people (I didn't get to do anything else / have an allowance during that time).

I also loved swimming, I did scuba diving when I got older too, but it's really just find what's a good fit for the individual, and that might change a lot as they grow.

Cycling might be good if the kid is old enough and the roads are safe"
Can give them a sense of independence as they get older
"I do mountain biking too but again, gotta be focused!"
"That's wonderful to hear ❤️ makes me feel like I'm doing something right! And, let me tell you, when you've got highly curious, creative twins with adhd (who yes, literally climb walls and have a strong tendency to break things, not always on accident) in a world that values quiet, mild mannered, polite children, validation is usually of the self variety 😅"
"Seriously, fostering a love of reading is one of the greatest things my parents did"
It’s so important.
"We've started some cycling! It took a loooong time to get them interested, but after they got the hang of it, they loved it"
One of them in particular seems to really be a natural
"After they got the hang of things in our neighborhood, we tried to take them out trail riding, and OMG was that fun and SO SCARY"
These kids have NO IDEA what they are/ are not capable of doing
"They just went full speed at everything, and after only about 15 minutes, we had to walk out of the woods because they both had broken their bikes (though thankfully not any bones)"
"

For crazy smart kids, they're a couple of knuckle heads"
"They're only 7, but I'm already deeply dreading the day they start driving..."
100% agreed
I really think that's the driver behind like 85% of my professional and academic successes in life
"I've always done well on standardized tests, but for example when I took the GRE for grad school admissions, I scored basically as high as you can on the verbal section (mostly reading comprehension and vocabulary)"
I had friends ask for tips on how to improve their verbal score and who asked about what I did to prep
The only thing I did to prep though was to read a lot from a young age.

Its not the end of the world
"The trades that failed highschool are driving sportscars and golfing, while the smart kids i knew are stuck working for managers that barely scraped through highschool."
"Ask yourself are you a person who has to needs to finish school right now, or can you see yourself in a trade job?   
    I'm not sating or telling anyone that blowing offbschool is a great general ideal , but if a trade is if mote interest at the moment."
"Hey, I’ve been there"
You can totally take an extra year and it’s okay
It’ll suck a little but in the long run the grades don’t even matter
Unfortunately it does matter for you to pass high school IF you want certain careers
"If not, there’s always trade school and you can do well in life with that.

School sucks, honestly"
Not designed for everyone’s brains
You’re not a failure
You should probably figure out what’s blocking you though - sounds like there’s some underlying anxiety.
"Oi little goose, high-school isn't the be all and end all of life"
"There are many other ways to get an education, to end up where you wanna be! 

When one door closes, another opens! It will be okay! Go outside, look at the sky"
"See all that space you have to freak out in? Your problems don't feel so big now do they? 

Everything *will* work out"
"One way or another, but it always does"
"

*HUG*"
I had a really hard time in school because of focus
It’s so so hard to focus on things I have zero interest in
My daughter is the same way too
If it’s things we’re interested in we can focus the hell out of it lol
Maybe think about getting a GED? Please know what you’re experiencing is widely experienced by others
Now that my daughter is in college and can pick her own classes and only taking a couple at a time she’s excelling
She was going to to go straight into the navy but changed her mind
Trade schools are also excellent
"In the meantime, don’t hesitate to talk to a guidance counselor, someone who will listen without judgement"
Schools push push college etc
But there are so many options for you
"I always told my daughter to try to keep as many doors open, so you do have those choices."
hey friend
"I get it, we've been there"
"To be honest with you, high school isn't all it's cracked up to be"
You will pass if you just don't quit
I failed my last year and it sucked..
Had to retake 12th grade at 19
Embarrassing
Went to an alternative school and looked up every answer on a computer until I passed like 15 credits worth of failure
"It's not the end of the world!

Ask for an alternative school"
"It's great, easy, it's how a lot of kids passed including myself"
"Screw meds, they aren't proven to do anything but keep you stimulated during school hours"
You're grown
Don't let school keep you down
"Also, I failed highschool"
Forgot to mention that
It’s why I replied to you
I’m 45 now and life all worked out
When you’re 18 it’s so hard to see past hs and grades and all the stuff they shove at you
But I promise you’ll get through and the next phase of life will be better because you can decided what YOU do!!!

"Object permanence is a thing, unfortunately (not for everyone, but I've seen it quite a few times and have it myself)"
"
And it's not personal he still cares about you he still loves you, but it's an out of sight out of mind kind of thing if I start thinking about people I miss it can spiral pretty quickly and put me in a bit of a hole"
"However, when I see them again, nothing has changed"
"
The feelings are all the same"
I never forgot about them they were just popped in a filing cabinet without sounding to robotic about it
"
When I start missing someone actively, it can interfere with everything I need to do that day, and to balance the two can be quite stressful"
"
It may be an idea to communicate with him maybe to just for both of you to put 30 mins (just a suggestion it could be 2 hours but that's to discuss between you two) aside at the same time every day to catch up when you are out of town.
That way, there's a time when he can focus on missing you ""actively"" and talk to you as well and visa versa"
"
This is only a suggestion, but I would want my partner to communicate this to me, and I'd probably even set an alarm for it every day if that is what they would like me to do.
Because in my head, I miss people for like 2, maybe 3 days, then poof"
"I still miss them, but the distractions/work/friends in my vicinity take my attention"
"
I hope I phrased most of this okay"
It's a difficult thing to describe without sound insensitive.
"If he texts a lot when he is travelling but not when you are, it sounds like it's an issue of routine"
"He's not used to texting you in his everyday life, so it needs more effort.

Or maybe he simply has more time to text when travelling (when he's home, he's probably eorking / at school / etc and its draining), or travelling gives him energy, etc

Have you tried telling him what you need with an I statement, not making it into an accusation? ""When I'm out of town I feel distant from you"
"Could you help me feel more connected by texting more often?"" or something like that"
"Without oversimplifying - maybe, likely, yes ? On meds or off meds, if I’m in the zone or trying to get my day in order my phone is either dead (because I forgot to charge it), lost (because I put in that particular spot that I thought would be a great spot) or on mute"
Sometimes I hate texting because it’s exhausting trying to type everything I want to say as quickly as my thoughts are going through my head and I hate talking on the phone because people always think I’m upset or being quiet when really I might be doing something else or thinking of what else I need to do today
"What helps, with my partner and I is FaceTime"
I don’t need to verbalize that I’m exhausted or
"It feeling talkative, I can just give him that look or we can sit and be quiet and not feel pressure to fill the empty space"
It feels closer to how we communicate when we’re together
"

You could also just ask him how he prefers to communicate"
"To be honest, when my wife is away (i'm the one with ADHD), i don't text all that much"
"I find other things to do, and, as is the nature of ADHD, forget"
"It's nothing personal to her, and she understands"
"

When I am away, as there are less familiar things around me (not my usual distractions), I text more"
"I'm not great going out by myself sometimes, for ADHD reasons I can explain if you want, but not important now, so I probably text my wife more as a bit of a 'security blanket'"
"I like having her 'nearer' when i'm away, but I can cope better when I'm in my 'safe place' (i.e., home)"
Hope that makes sense
"

I'm sure he probably doesn't even realise there is a difference in communication, and if he texts more when he is away, perhaps that's the reason he needs you more then."
It’s called „object permanence“ and it’s not directly linked to adhd
"So people can have it or not, regardless if adhd"
But a friend of mine has it in extreme too so if her boyfriend is „out of sight“ she almost forgets him completely
It’s kind of frustrating for the other person for sure
"

Maybe if you feel a little bit out of emotion, you could tell him? Like „i don’t feel you right now"
Are you absence with your thoughts“ or similar
Don‘t
I personally don’t struggle with this issue at least when it comes to people
Both me and boyfriend have adhd
"We live together so it's not an issue for us, but maybe a little in the beginning of our relationship"
"His kids live in another part of the country, and he always says ""out of sight, out of mind"", so maybe that's the thing with your bf?"
"Oh wow, well thank you for sharing! I learned something knew."
"Hi, I appreciate your response"
"I'll be sure to let him know, thank you!"
"Hi, I thank you for your response and sharing! Oh I know he hates talking on the phone"
Luckily I don't get offended by him wanting to make the call short
I'll definitely ask again he's preference- I know it's texting but you may be right about him just bring in his zone.
Thank you I appreciate your response! This actually really helps me understand him better
He doesn’t travel but when I do I try to remember that he’s not doing it on purpose
And the love resume when I return
So I guess it’s for me to better understand.
Thank you for your response and thank you for sharing this!
Thank you for your response and after everyone’s comments I’m beginning to think the same thing too.
You're welcome
It would be good to clarify with him if this is something he experiences
Because it is easy to blame the disorder itself
"Personally, I try never to use it as an excuse, but sometimes, I am unaware of what I'm doing until it is pointed out to me"
Just give him room to explain as its very difficult for me to explain why I do what I do sometimes
"I love using metaphors for it, but it's not always so transparent"
Understanding is key to all of this
"
If he pars it off to adhd (for the quick getaway), then ask him to explain how the adhd affects this behaviour"
"Whatever he says, try not to be upset he may just be explaining it badly, but later on, he'll have an epiphany of how to describe it."
"Having ADHD isn't easy, and it's not something one can control (especially without meds, but even meds are not a miracle cure)"
"Meds help focus, which may help him stop for 5 seconds and think 'i'll just send a text to (you)', but someone once likened ADHD to 'a Ferrari brain, with bicycle brakes '"
"I have 50 thoughts in my brain at any moment, so narrowing down to just one...not easy"
"I applaud you for sticking with him, as ADHD people sometimes mess up relationships, not because they want to, but just because 'they do'"
I wish you both all the very best.
You‘re very welcome
Hope it helps to undertand him even better
It’s kind of you
Of course! He always says how much he appreciates my patience and understanding
So I am aware to not take it personally
"I will bring it up but I noticed something he's reluctant, kind of like ashame to acknowledge things related to his adhd or anything that seems off"
I try to always reword my way of speaking to him but I do want to bring it up to him.
Thank you for sharing
I’m sure it’s not easy getting criticize
I learned that people with ADHD are one of the strongest people
"You guys do so much that we don’t see or experience yet you guys get up everyday and give it your all.
And thank you for the best wishes!"
"Definitely helps! :) 
I appreciate it, thank you."
"Well then, he doesn't like to blame the adhd either, which is great, like really respectable"
"Although I don't like doing it, we excel in some areas but have limitations in others"
We are all looking for someone like yourself with patience and understanding
"He may be ashamed because he took the step to come off his meds, which is also really cool it'll be another decade before I dare try that"
"But in doing so, he wants to prove he can function day to day in all areas without them and if he can't that may be something that is difficult for him to admit but he has to figure that put for himself"
(That's only my view on the limited information I have
"It could be something different).

It may be best to approach him in a normal, comfortable setting and bring it up casually don't give much warning on the matter because that could lead to overthinking"
"But if he doesn't give an answer and maybe walks away or changes the subject, best believe he is thinking about a response and probably an explanation"
Sugarcoating stuff can feel patronising to him (it would to me anyway)
"I would just want to be approached ""organically"" and In person of course, just have an honest conversation about it or open with ""may I say my piece and I'll give you time to think (followed by reassurances of things you know he may consider)"" , he may have an explanation ready, he may apologise profusely and try his best to do better or he may yeah change the subject and come back to you, it's possible he can walk away to think more intensely"
"I know sometimes anger can come with adhd I don't have that, thankfully, but if this is a possibility, timing is way more important"
But I feel he will listen and hear what you're saying it just may take some time to process
"

Long winded, sorry for the essay but it's interesting to me"
I'm happy to give my view
Objectively speaking.
Don't apologies for the explanation
I really appreciate you taking the time to explain
"It's definitely given me alot to think about, approach wise."
"Well, I hope it all goes well"
"He definitely deserves someone such as yourself, going through the time to actually come to a page to ask how and why he may be behaving this way"
And trying to fully understand
It's nice to know there are people willing to do this as sometimes it really doesn't
"

Best of luck"
I hope he's okay with it (he should be
"We are just regular people just a little different, that's all)"
Let me know how it goes if you remember otherwise take care
"
😁 (put it in the wrong place 🤣)"
"Thank you and of course! He's been nothing but amazing, respectful and sweet"
We've never have gotten into an argument in our 2 yrs together
It's been very well balance
I appreciate everyone's input and welcome to me asking.

Pay attention to if you both are making an effort to acknowledge each other's feelings and points of view before arguing against them
" Are you both owning up to your own contributions to the issue at hand or does only one of you say ""sorry""?  Are you addressing the problem when you both have the resources available to be present for the discussion?  Are you each offering up alternative options to what the other person is asking for if you don't like their suggestions, or just shutting them down?

Look up the importance of acknowledgement in conflict.

Ask the other if they need to be heard, helped, hugged, or humped."
I’d say this is a general relationship issue than an ADHD issue
Communication breakdowns are as old as time
You guys could probably benefit from counseling to help you guys phrase better and hear each other out.

Okay
Deep breath
"And again 

Not insane, the stories we tell ourselves to protect our own self worth includes dragons"
"

Is the alternative to not taking them all that much better ? 
Just because you feel control of your own suffering does not make that suffering anymore or less meaningful.

If you expect the meds to clear your wall of shame they won’t"
But they give you the basic fundamentals to start working on it
"

I think we should also be talking to ourselves a little more gently"
You aren’t pessimistic and idiotic
You are rightfully worried about putting a new chemical into your brain
You may even be scared that this medication is not going to fix what is you think is wrong with you
"So why even get my hopes up in the first place? 

You are exhausted of this friction"
And the meds can help make that feeling of friction feel less insurmountable
"
Please be patient with yourself!"
I’ll take them off your hands if you don’t want them! 🙋🏻‍♀️😂
"""Basic fundamentals to start working on it"""
I needed to hear that
Needed someone to tell me that
Makes me actually believe it
"Thank you, really"
I'll try to be nicer to myself as well
"

Just went to take my first dose before submitting this reply!"
Wowowowowo so glad I could help
Really
"
And how did it feel?

I think it’s important to stay reflective in the early stages of the meds and don’t plan to do too many things"
I don’t know if it is an ADHD trait but I certainly often bite off more than I can chew and tend to blame myself when I cannot cope with it all
"

Do normal stuff around the house and see how the meds influence your experience in these tasks"
"

Read a book/article and see how quick/often you feel distracted and how long that distraction lasts"
"

This journey is never ending"
That can be daunting and empowering

I have the same symptoms
"I had hyperhidrosis before starting Vyvanse, and it sent it into high gear"
But the benefits outweigh the cost
Get Lume deodorant
I swear the unscented version works better than any of the scented
And they have an antiperspirant now and it’s great.
I haven't experienced that but I wanted to mention that [this](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/science-vs/o2hmd7m) podcast episode really clarified some things about body odor and how it works for me
"Basically, the odor isn't coming from your sweat, it's coming from the bacteria that lives on your skin and more or less eats your sweat"
My guess would be more sweat has led to more bacteria which then produces a stronger odor
"If you have any skincare products with salicylic or glycolic acid, you could try using those on the parts of your body that tend to get sweaty to wipe out some of the bacteria"
Just be careful not to overexfoliate
"I use red Stridex pads, no more than once a week.

Good luck - I hope you find meds that work for you <3"
Vyvanse is a CNS stimulant
I don't know how common excess sweating is but it fits the effects profile that comes with these kinds of meds
" Thankfully these effects go away when the drug is out of your system, so it's not something you're now stuck with."
Stimulant medications can increase your body temp
This could be impacting your sweating production
I do think I am more sweaty but I’m not sure if it’s a Vyvanse thing or a change to natural deodorant because they occurred around the same time
"Either way, a bit annoying but nothing I can’t live with"
"Yea, it's a side effect"
"I did sweat like mad, especially at night when I started taking it"
"It was the worst during the first 6 months, and more or less stopped after the first year."
Lol @ “uncommon”
" During the summer, I feel like the sun"
" I am also a mosquito magnet, so I like to wear pants and a light long sleeved shirt when I do yard work"
" If I did that while on vyvanse, I’d probably self immolate."

So now that's over and I'm still single after all these years"
But I'm not complaining
Being single is pretty chill.
26 male and I’m like this too
I have social anxiety that stems from masking my hyperactivity
I make terrible first impressions with making friends let alone potential romantic interests
I usually appear to be stoic (but I’m really just heavily masking)
Those that stick around to meet a fraction of my personality are usually surprised by the chaos i hide
I notice it’s difficult for people to joke around with me
I can be funny and sociable
I just need practice because masking effectively stunted my social skills
Still waiting for an extrovert to adopt me
"  

Also i always assumed my evasiveness towards relationships was because my undiagnosed father ruined it for me"
He is the type that engaged in “Risky Sexual Behavior” that jeopardized his marriage to my mom and he believes it is justified because “all men cheat”
I never wanted to be like that so maybe this and RSD are the main reasons i am hesitant to pursue one.
im 39 and I too still dont know how to date too XD
"Have you tried ""Just being yourself"" ? /s

I'm 37 and I went through that"
"  
Here's an advice: don't aim for dating, aim for improving your overall social skills"
that worked for me.
only had one partner my whole life am terrified to date tbh idk i don’t understand the concept it overall seems like a waste of time which is why i don’t do it
We need a dating app for people w/ ADHD or Autism cuz I don't know how to do this shit either.
Is OP me? Am I you? Did I write this? 😔
I was like you but female so i got chased but never by the one i wanted until i made my move
"I'm 34 and have been in multiple relationships in the past, not sure how that came to be to be honest"
As I've always been super weird when dating
"Won't kiss, totally freeze when someone makes sexual advances"
"And in general I act super strange, struggle with cues, eye contact, ""normal"" and flirty conversations"
"Everything gets weird once I like someone, or even don't like someone that likes me"
"Then I have a hard time rejecting that person, due to low confidence and guilty conscience"
"Like ""who am I to turn this person down"""
"The weirdness around anyone I like, trigger my stressresponses so much, I truly hate dating"
Feels way worse than any job interview
"Dating should be fun and exciting, am I right? Have therefore decided not to date no more, at least for a long time"
"And if the day and time comes for me to want to date again, I might not find anyone interested.😅"
Same
"M31, never been in a relationship, never had sex"
"I've been on a date once, through Tinder, but it led to nothing"
I have no concept of what I am supposed to do
"I don't know how to court, how to flirt, how to show interest"
I have no connection to the opposite sex.
I’m gonna share about my own experience
"

I have add but I’m kinda similar to you"
I don’t know how to talk to women in a way that convey my attraction the right way
And I feel like I’m invisible to most women I come across
I’m so scared to come off as a creep or weirdo and then get called out for it
Or just being made fun of
I think it stems from a trauma that my ex gave me
"

She never did anything I described above but she really hurt me when she dumped me, because she dumped me without saying why"
And I really loved her so I was crushed
I also got bullied by women when I was in school
"

But now, I gotta get over that trauma so that I can live my life the way I want, and that means talking to lots of women, and getting shot down many times"
"I’ve been talking to this gorgeous blonde at work, but I won’t lie, sometimes I go to her on trembling legs"
"Cause it’s scary as hell.

I’m 31 and this is a fear I’ve had since my late school years"
I want the pain gone!
34M and have no idea how to do this either
"Growing up i learned to ""MASK"" my adhd self to be accepted"
Having friends is important but very few ever really knew me
"I put on a front that i knew was acceptable and went with it despite my struggles.

Fast forward decades later, diagnosed with ADHD, medicated, and can now be ""normalish"""
"As an adult, I have no fucking idea how to be me and be accepted"
"I've had a couple longer relationships, as someone i'm not"
"Eventually they figure out that i'm ""different"" as a result of my struggles when the medication wears off, and boom..."
"Back to square one.

Spoiler alert, being someone you're not while trying to find authentic connection...."
"DOESN'T WORK.

Forever lone hobbiest.."
"🤣😅 If you figure it out, let me know"
The struggle is real!
I’ve only ever had success with other adhd people.
"Just like everyone else, people with ADHD come in many varieties"
"I’ve always been jealous of people with ADHD who didn’t grow up in restrictive, punishing environments and are just loud and proud and goofy"
"When the environment is permissive to expression and encouraging your authentic self you’re less likely to become anxious and down… more likely to socialize, and more likely to see sex as another stimuli to chase with all the good and bad that comes with it"
"

I think the key to connecting with other people is to connect with yourself"
Learn what you like and pursue it so you have common ground to connect with people
You will be hard-pressed to connect with someone just based on the fact that they’re the opposite sex
You may want to pursue something you liked a while ago but stopped because it seemed childish or you decided not to continue because it was outside your comfort zone
"This might mean prioritizing the things you like that lead to in-person interaction.

If you have regrets now those feelings will only deepen if you stay on the same course"
"When it comes to socializing (or anything else really) sometimes you just have to eat shit, pick yourself up and continue on"
If you fear bad social interactions and avoid the source you also cut yourself off from the good interactions too
Objectively view what behavioral traits you’ve developed to protect your ego and evaluate if they are still working for you
If they aren’t you may have to push yourself outside of your comfort zone and actively work to do the opposite thing
And eventually it gets easier
"Once you’re waist deep doing something you love instead of just banging your head into dating you will naturally run into people that you develop connections with on multiple levels and that could lead to something.

Ok relevant story time so I don’t seem like I’m just preaching:

I decided I wasn’t getting out enough because I was becoming a bit of an agoraphobe with my work schedule"
I forced myself to go to card shops and play Magic because I used to play YuGiOh when I was younger (but was always anxious at events all the time zzz)
Maybe the second or third night I was paired against a woman who seemed rather prickly at first (card shops are a rough environment for women)
But chatting during and after our match I learned she was a karaoke DJ
"She said “you should come out sometime, I’m actually doing a show after this”"
I decided *well I’m here to socialize and I don’t think I want to sing but I will not turn down this invite*
"

We spoke about music we liked and our formative teen bands"
She encouraged me further out of my shell and I started singing here and there
And oh boy did I suck (and I’m still too critical about my performance; she always says I’m too hard on myself)
But my dad always sang in bands so I was always passionate about vocalists and their nuances despite my social anxiety restricting me
So I kept going and kept pushing myself to go up there even if I was more anxious about it than usual
"I discovered how great an emotional outlet it is, like releasing pressure that’s all but ready to explode… and people clapped and would come up to me and say things like “that was great, I’m too nervous to sing”"
"And I’m like *uhhhh me too*.

That DJ became a good friend and eventually when I got married she DJ’d our wedding"
We go floating on the river in the summer with karaoke people
We do Friendsgiving
I still go and sing because now I want that outlet
All because I forced myself out of the apartment and forced myself to the show
Just saying
I can easily socialize with those people about music and encourage others even when I feel awkward as hell
But I never went out with a singular end goal
Just pushed myself in the direction of my discomfort
Whatever you do don’t create an island and stay on it.
"Why don't you create a support group and try to practice?
You have a good sample size of people who are actually facing the same problem.

Rather than suffering alone lets suffer together"
"I have 4 ex girlfriends and I can still relate (26, M)

I have no idea how to date, 3 out of those 4 I met occasionally in social places and things just happened but I have no idea what I did right lol"
"

Only the last one I met through a dating app, and the only reason it worked in my opinion is because she thought I'm above her level.."
When I date women that I feel equal to them it's never work (look + personality + career)
"

Btw I only realized that I have ADHD a month ago, maybe after I'll start meds things will be different.

I always felt that there's something wrong with me that destroys the attraction, now I guess it's the ADHD (my appearance is more than decent, I'm a good person, till my business collapsed I also had a fat income and even then dating was the same)."
"DD-MM-YYYY of course, anything else is weird, but that’s probably me being aroace…"
"I thought I posted it and forgot, I'm also 27"
I'm 20 and just have never tried..
"So, Same boat"
28m and I also am lost with how to go about dating at this point
"Also anxious and depressed, might be more of the anxiety and depression than the ADHD then? Seems to be common in here?"
"My main problem with dating was I'd psyche myself up about the person I'd get infatuated with, and then my normal witty and funny self would just shit the bed when trying to talk to them or I just wouldn't say anything.

I'm nearing 40 now, and tbh I found the hellhole of online dating helpful only in the sense that you can like chat with a screen between first"
"So, I feel like I can feel someone out and expose them to my ""extra"" personality.

A lot of women were like, ""Why do you divulge so much and overshare it's weird,"" - fair enough, but the person I'm with now thinks it's perfect lol just took me a few years to find her 😅

A first date is usual a little awkward, generally speaking, I think"
"I have told dates that I get unnecessarily nervous on dates, and vocalizing that to them right at the start helps me assuage the bad feeling in my torso"
"It's was usually well received and if it's not fuck em.

You gotta let yourself feel vulnerable and just go for it"
"I was rejected a lot, and I basically don't really care anymore"
"I used to care *ALOT*.

I also have to take my meds on dates because it's really hard to fully engage in a conversation without, at least at the start of a thing.

Edit: it's early, and I skimmed the post and assumed you were looking for advice"
"If you weren't, sorry for the advice word vomit, lol"
"40, M, and I have no freaking clue either"
"And not just dating either, just having relationships is so hard but I get so lonely."
I'm bisexual
"
28"
"Never had a girlfriend or a boyfriend.
Well I'm demisexual too and need a strong emotional connection to be attracted to begin with"
"So...
I'm on apps and just making friends instead 😂"
Maybe one day it'll be more than a friend.
Us😅 I don't manifest ADHD that much but no skills in that department or that my method is more I don't wanna date I wanna marry someone but how do I marry without date xD
"My advice is keep working on yourself, your image, yourself expression, join communities and it will happen sooner but you have got to be intentional or picky with your feelings because we feel too much and too hard sometimes"
"Am 29, and same experience"
I tried to date from about 20 to 25 but never got anything to last more than a couple months
"Some of the issues were eventually explained by my diagnosis, for example, hearing “I feel like you’re bored with me” and not understanding why they felt that way"
"I haven’t dated since the beginning of the pandemic, for obvious reasons at first, but the time alone and learning about ADHD after my diagnosis made me realize that I’m not really fit for a relationship"
"I understand now that bringing another person into my life will always cause chaos because I struggle enough when I’m only responsible for myself, and it’s really not fair to others"
I can do other things with my life and try to make things better for the people around me in other ways.
I never went on a single date
Just had text convos that went nowhere for 25 years before I met my wife
"Spent the night the first time I went over to her apartment, then she took me to see the sunrise over the river.

I had given up dozens of times, but as others said it's just about dusting yourself off and trying again"
Difficult when rejection stings so much but there are people out there that we'll fit in with
Just have to find them.
I feel that it has little to do with ADHD (or if it does I would guess ADHD is not the main culprit)
"

Many men feel the same….some subconscious attitude that puts dating on a pedestal and overthink its importance"
"The reasons for that are complex, from upbringing to role models, be it discomfort around women due to them playing a huge role in your family life or fear of rejection due to some trauma or just simple shines"
This is important to keep in mind going forward to avoid an unhealthy relationship once you do get a partner
"

If you enter a relationship with the mindset of “this is huge, I got to work hard to make this work, I’m so lucky” you may end up missing the tell tale signs of a mismatch, or worse end up being hurt by someone who may take advantage of you.

I think what really helps is to get a few things out of the way first"
"

Firstly get comfortable with rejection and play statistics"
There are  many people who are either not for you or you are not for them
And that’s ok
But you won’t find out until you try
And at this stage if you haven’t had much success in your love life it pays to play the numbers
Try dating more often
"And don’t be afraid approach, providing it is appropriate"
Each approach may feel scary but you will quickly desensitise to people saying “no”
More importantly you will learn from your mistakes and become more comfortable with the way you communicate with people
"Also you will quickly realise that the basic dating ritual is pretty much the same:

1"
"You start up a chat, be it on the street or on the app.

2"
"You see if you have anything in common.

3"
"You decide to ask him/her out on a date

4"
"You talk about things you found in common at the outset.

5"
You talk about yourself or let them talk about them
Listen
Relate to your personal experience
"Bounce the same questions back at them.

You can be funny and animated"
Or silent and mysterious
Loud
Quite
Shy
Extroverted
None of these reduce your chances of finding a partner
"

On the other hand being rude, boastful, insensitive, jealous, overly emotional and overly sharing are type of things that may be flagged up against you on the first date"
"Though these are traits that we all share to some extent they are on the whole seen as negatives and a person would need to reevaluate themselves if they exhibit these on regular bases.

Most importantly you just need to be yourself"
Not pretend
"This will help you meet someone who you really click with.

And then see how it goes.

Keep in mind that dating on the whole is stressful for everyone in one way or another"
Both parties experience anxiety before the first get together
Both parties want to like the other person AND want to be liked by them
"And to be honest both parties want to get laid providing the person is safe, a normal person and they feel attracted to (though the latter isn’t necessarily a deal breaker for men or women)"
"At the core people just want to connect.

So yeah, start dating"
Be bad at it
Until you get good at it
"Don’t commit your life to the next person you date purely because you snagged yourself a REAL woman/man, unless it’s genuinely going well"
"

Remember things change"
"And sometimes relationships don’t workout because people change, or feelings change or situations change"
"Be prepared to work for it BUT be prepared to let go; you can’t control another person, how they behave or feel, you can only control your own attitude and willingness to be a good partner and a positive influence in their life."
Well let me start by saying i was petrified also at a young age
I got rejected and it hurt
"Finally, I decided to just randomly talk/hit on women (appropriately with nice gentle compliments) to get used to the rejection"
"It actually helped a lot and a couple of the girls actually gave me their numbers, real numbers too"
So maybe try to practice and expose yourself to rejection or the uncomfortable feelings in the pretense that this is a learning experience for you.
"Me neither, I did it once but was Hella confused by everything"
Just do it make yourself desirable and someone that people wanna be around
 Met multiple women fron kik in real life that became a regular thing.
"i’m only 20, but i’m right there with you"
i have AuDHD and have been in a few relationships before
"

i’m not being dramatic when i say they were all dumpster fires and ended badly, it wasnt all my fault but i certainly played a role"
"

i don’t know how to date, or hold conversations and small talk, touch makes me want to tear my skin off 90% of the time, i don’t understand social nuance or context clues, and i prefer to be by myself most of the time and i absolutely cannot find it in me to do the whole sex thing"
"i find most people utterly draining sometimes, which certainly doesn’t help"
"

i’ve just entered a new relationship with a guy whom i very much like and honestly i’m shitting bricks about messing it all up"
"luckily he’s been very kind and understanding about how my brain works and all the odd boundaries i have, but the fear is still there"
"its going well so far, so fingers crossed with this one"
"

its hard to find someone compatible, but the only solution i’ve found thus far is to just date someone who also has ADHD or similar diagnoses, they tend to understand us far better than anyone else."
"Same boat as you, what really helped me was being upfront about this and finding partners that understood and also were similar"
Really changed the game for me
i get it....
"I just gave up lol.

I don't understand shit about it."
We didn't date we just hung out like friends and sometimes she would sleep over in my dorm rooms cos it's near campus.
"find a local sex educator!

over in DC we have the Pincus center."
27 too and never had a partner
Got social anxiety and low confidence and only recently realised a lot of it stemmed from intense masking
Got no problem making friends tho
I had this problem as a teenager and young adult and in hindsight the issue was just lack of confidence and fear of rejection
" Once I actually started asking girls out at age 21, I went on quite a few dates, had a semi-serious girlfriend for awhile, and met my now-wife when I was 25"
" We celebrate our 16th anniversary in January!  I recommend being willing to take risks, ask single female friends on dates if you are attracted to them, try online dating, etc"
" Like others have commented, you miss 100% of the shots you don’t take."
Are you me? But seriously I have the exact same problem
I want to feel close to someone but I have no idea how closeness works.
"full same

i had some dates and the lack of spontaneity felt so weird to me

being aware of the fact that we're studying each other to see if we find each other attractive makes it so uncomfortable

the only possible scenario of me starting to see someone is when i meet someone and the main event isn't to find somebody to date, and while talking there's a moment where we both understand we like each other and spontaneously kiss and decide to keep contact

it happens rarely but i like the feeling that it came straight from wherever our love comes from

the process of dating feels so ""forced"" to me

i'm not sure if it's related to adhd tho"
Have u considered you may possibly also have autism? It seems very common that people with ADHD and Autism don't completely relate to others with only ADHD or only autism
I have both and it makes it very difficult to socialize
I found a youtuber recently who has been helping me
Julienhimself
"I don't know much about him, I just discovered him last night but he taught me a lot about loving myself and finding out why I am the way I am, why I care, why I mask and how to deal with these issues.

I think a massive portion of the loneliness epidemic is the fact that we all wear these masks, and we don't even know who we really are inside and the steps to take to put yourself out there are super simple: all you have to do is love yourself the way you want to love someone else"
"Find out what you like, treat yourself right, take yourself out on dates, find hobbies, and go places"
"You'll find people, and even if you can't talk to them outright, you're in the pool, and from there, it's just working on starting conversations and seeing where it goes."
I’m not really interested in girls in general
"Then I meet a girl who really vibes with me, then I mess it up with all the overfixation and rejection intolerance"
I hate it.
Same
I have an objectively easy time making friends
"I'm horrible at maintaining friendships (grateful to fellow adhd and such friends who get it, so friendships that last kind of maintain themselves)"
And i do not understand how dating works
I'm 31f
My family thinks I'm hiding my personal life from them and it's been like this for as long as I can remember
"With like random grownups when i was a teen, and now just with family (i live abroad, so they have a bit of extra FOMO)"
"Like it's unbelievable to them I'm not seeing anybody and so it's always like ""fine, keep your private life private"""
"And it never made any sense to me especially when younger, because such strongly convinced reactions imply that they think I'm irresistible or something??? Or that dating just naturally happens out of nowhere??? Both of which end up feeling insulting, because irresistible or unavoidable- and yet single 😅 

Anyhow"
"I have had partners but not only do I not have the spicy dating type of ADHD, I also don't develop attraction to people that way all that often"
And when I do it's like a hyperfixation that can last for many years even if it's one-sided
Sooo.
" yes, I get you"
I do not relate to the super outgoing ADHD type either
And I have no idea how anybody meets and dates anybody.
Perhaps ADHD has nothing to do with it?
How’s your career?
"I get ya, man"
I’ve come to realise that at a formative age I learnt being myself was not safe
I was bullied pretty heavily for being odd at primary school and people always make a point of pointing out my eccentricities
"

Even though, unlike you, I am sociable… I really struggle with dating because the moment I have to tell someone I want something from them (sex, romance, help, respecting a boundary) my body starts to set off alarm bells.

Not all ADHD people are hypersexual"
I think it just depends whither the RD section out weights the adrenaline
Personally I’ve never had such easy access to sex that I’ve bot feared being humiliated or rejected by it.
"Few days late to this thread, but it's really resonating with me. 




24M, I do feel like ADHD (and subsequent anxiety/depression) has caused me to struggle hard with this aspect of life"
"I've had 2 formal girlfriends but we dated only a few months each time, so I feel like I've never had a ""serious"" long-term relationship"
"My most recent relationship got started around 5 years ago now, so it's been a long time and I've been lonely for a while. 




I can't help but feel like ADHD has contributed to this, but it's hard to pinpoint how"
"It's discouraging when searching for ""adhd difficulty with finding relationships"" brings up either 1) articles talking about how to handle a relationship with someone with ADHD or advice for those already in relationships, or 2) threads on this sub full of people indicating they have long-term partners"
"With my short relationship history it's hard to wrap my mind around dating for *years*.




Maybe the worst part is that it's a compounding problem - the less experience you have, the more you fall behind, and you're less likely to find a relationship, the cycle repeats"
I've spent virtually my entire early 20s single when it sounds like this is the time of life one should be most active with dating
God I hate having this kind of brain sometimes.
"29M and I've never ""dated"" either, I've just always felt that if I like a girl I should make obvious non-verbal advances and everything will be fine (at least it always worked well this way)"
"However, I'm in a long-term relationship with my current girlfriend now and she's the first girl who told me it's fucking weird that I've never invited her to restaurants or museums (which is the dating norm in my country I guess)"
"But if we ever break up, it'll be fucking hard to find a new partner without this conventional ""dating"" game which I find fake and boring."
"I don't know if anyone has mentioned this, but have you looked into asexuality? I might be reading this wrong, but it definitely comes across like you have problems with comparison and lots of aces feel that sex was what everyone wanted before realising they were ace"
"

If that's not the case, are you maybe getting in your own head? Nothing made me better at dating than accepting me for me, with my flaws, and just trying to have a good time, low expectations"
"I used to have awful self esteem and now, I mostly love myself."
"Well, didn’t expect ADHD to be a deciding factor for stuff like this but that describes me almost perfectly as well lol"
"From experience, just make more advances - that’s literally it - you’ll miss 100% of the chances you don’t take, but you may well succeed with 10-20% of the chances that you do take"
"Same, and I'm bi"
I fear rejection from all genders 🤣
People who want to date will date
Here's a crazy conceopt: Tell them how you feel it solves all questions and gives you all the answers
"Friend or Girlfriend? Talk to them about it.

There is 100% a woman who probably shares these exact same thoughts as you but here's the kicker..."
That doesn't mean she's right for you
"The person who is right for you may have completely different tastes in music, jokes, diet, etc.

Dating should never feel like work.

If you're spending all your energy working hard to impress someone that's not sustainable"
" If someone is REALLY into going to the gym and you're not, how long do you think you'd last if you actually hate it? Meet in the middle"
"That could be post gym food, or joining them once a week, or connecting in an entirely different way.

The problem with online dating is everything thinks they know what the perfect match is and they have too much information and they're too picky"
In the real outside world you might sing a song at a bar and someone will join in just because it felt right
"Or you may exchange glances and have an awkward conversation where you get their number and meet up for coffee one day.

As for the difference between a friend and a relationship..."
"A relationship should always start as a friendship, but it needs to evolve in a timely manner"
(Make your intentions known
"If you're struggling cliche romantic gestures like flowers, an embrace / hand holding while together etc is probably a start.)

Tldr;

All of the worlds problems can be solved with a little bravery, over communication, and a little effort."
Dude .
"I'm m,24 and that's so me 🥲"
I’ve seen those Youtube shorts/Maybe tiktok (idk i don’t have the app) of those British couple where the wife has really chaotic ADHD and the husband is a very understanding norme
My ADHD is not even as chaotic but i need to find a patient and understanding person like that
ADHD or not
You get it
"Anytime I would ""miss a match"" on a dating app, it's almost always someone who wants kids or is in a poly relationship"
"And like good for them, respect, but not the life I'm looking for

Slowly giving up on the apps now though"
"It doesn't really work well with how my brain works, it feels"
"Yeah other people’s lives seem overwhelming to me, especially travel and kids"
But unfortunately working 7 days a week because I need all that time to get 5 days of work done and refusing to buy a car because I love my routine bus trips hasn’t been a major selling point to anyone looking for a partner
I get unwanted pity a lot more than I get romantic interest lol.
This
"I've even been polyamorous and at least then those people are less likely to want kids 😅 but now I realise I barely have enough meaningful time and energy for one person, I need it several steps simpler than a polycule 😅 just someone compatible to be relatively introverted nerds together with 😅 but no luck"
"Wait you never wanted on a date ( like going out to eat , movies , park walks , events , etc) with her but decided y’all were in a relationship? Or did I misread this"
That is..
Scary
"I'm also 26, stoic when first meeting followed by an absolute degenerate goofball once I'm comfortable around someone"
"Mask-on default, undiagnosed father that ruined our family, dedicated to not being like him so consciously adverse to hitting on women, paired with RSD & stunted social skills"
"

I hate it :)"
100% - Pretty poor use of time in my brain as well.
100%
"🙋‍♂️ 

I will admit, it takes one to know one"
And i feel much more comfortable around like minded females likely also struggling.
Damn
I was told by my family members that I was a pretty outgoing kid but the when I was about 6 or 7 I somehow changed
I turned into a much more introverted and shy version of myself
I don't have many memories from that time so I always wondered what happened
I started school when I was 6 and there was a bit of a baby boom around the time I was born and the educational system wasn't prepared
We ended up with 30+ kids in each class with just one teacher so goofing around was shut down pretty quickly
I wonder if the environment once I started school was the reason for the change.

"Genuinely curious: what would that look like exactly? 

I'm not OP, but I tried to just envision how someone would go about creating a support group and what they would do exactly, and I'm lost 😅"
"lol, wasn’t expecting this"
Definately not alone! That's for damn sure!
"Any specific things you feel make you different from another ADHD people? I’ve been considering this but I don’t feel like I relate to a lot of the autism characteristics, only about half of them"
"I get annoyed by very loud places but not in a way that is impossible for me to handle, I don’t have problems with sarcasm, eye contact is complicated or course, but what I mean is, I feel like I don’t relate completely to it? 


I have considered asking this to my psychiatrist, but our next session is in 3 months from now"
"
I also relate more to AuDHD influencers than ADHD only influencers"
"But dunno, it’s probably in my mind till I confirm something like that? If I had to say, I’ll say I’m not autistic, but who knows!"
Very probably
"However, I recently read an investigation paper about people in my situation and about 35% turned out to be in the autism spectrum"
"I am not autistic, however, it made me wonder if ADHD had an effect on it as well!"
"I have looked into it, but it’s kind of weird because I have a high libido actually and I absolutely love women, but I just can’t get into a relationship or even a one night stand"
It’s been like this since the last 8 years
Had an “almost relationship” back then but we never had sex or something.
This
I was awkward when I was young
Afraid to ask a girl out
Missed the signs they were flirting with me
I was afraid of rejection
I was a decent looking young man so girls approached me sometimes and I didn't know how to react
"But my life changed when I just realized it was a numbers game.

 If I saw a cute girl, I would just talk to her"
I would ask her out
"If she said no, then so what? It didn't matter"
I'd move on and talk to another one
It worked
"Like a charm! If we hooked up and it didn't work out, so what? We had a nice couple of days.

This was in the 90s so it's different now, with phones and social media  but women still want to be persued"
 Don't listen to the ones that are mean about it
"There are girls that are shy like you that wish someone like you would come in and say hi.

 Don't be a creep, but just smile and say hi"
 Ask her name
Then just start talking
Close the deal
Ask her if she wants to hang out
"Don't skip this part!  If she says no, rinse and repeat"
"  One of them will dig you.

Go to a place where girls are hanging out"
"Like local music fests, etc.

I wish I figured this out way sooner."
"I mean just don't do things that make them uncomfortable, knowing they are interested in you before is a must."
I would like to add that a great way to ease some of the rejection sensitivity is to subject yourself to repeated rejection over something stupid
"My solution to this in high school was jokingly asking people for a dollar, at least a few people a day"
"It was a win win, I either got to work on being rejected or had enough money for a couple cookies from the cafeteria"
"I’m sure there’s less annoying ways than asking for a dollar, but find something that’s easy for them to reject you but also easy to accept"
Then try it with people you would like to pursue
Worked for me and now I’m in a happy relationship of over 2 years
"Yeah, my best friend is poly and I love seeing how he’s able to be happy for people he loves finding joy with other people"
"And I did a lot of reading about poly at one point to see if it was for me, but i’ve realised it just wouldn’t fit with who I am

Yeah dating apps aren’t healthy for me"
"I used them on and off for a year, and now I’m trying to figure out how to increase my chances of meeting someone without going back on them 😅"
"Shiiit, yeah that’s a full week!! I do hope whoever I fall for next has a fair amount of time they’re able and want to spend with me"
"But my last boyfriend theoretically had lots of time available, but in practice, I didn’t get to talk to him nearly as much as I wanted"
"So… I mostly just want someone who will make me a priority, however much time they have"
Well we eventually did do date things but it was more like hanging out with friends
But at first it was just me doing my usual things.
![gif](giphy|eYcVQMJ2GMpmn4DNPx|downsized)
"It is not that difficult imo, 

1.We create a group chat on reddit of everyone who is interested.
2"
Then we ask everyone their nationality and what they would like help with
"In this case relationship or work life or any general topic, putting them in broad categories.
3"
"We pair up in groups of 2-5, based on our nationality and preference, nationality because of the time difference etc.
4"
We form smaller chats on reddit where the buddies can bud together help each other out
"

Just my opinion."
"It’s a relevant point about autism actually, a number of people I know with adhd display some traits of autism (I am not assuming or attempting to diagnose anyone, that’s a doctor’s job)"
"So yep, it could be a factor"
Relationships can be complex as it is.
"I hate one night stands too tbf, I get emotionally attached to people I sleep with"
I'd rather have a casual situation that isn't a one off
What is it that is stopping you getting into a relationship out of interest? Is it a lack of desire or more that it's an exhausting process?
It’s the “don’t be a creep” part that worries me
"Like I’d rather not risk it instead of potentially coming off creepy and not realizing, it feels like it’s too easy to be misunderstood in those situations."
Don't hit on people at work
"Otherwise, if you aren't being a creep and she thinks you are, who cares? Move on"
People wouldn't get together if someone doesn't walk up and say hi.
Dont hit on every girl at a party
Thats creepy
But they are just girls
Just striking up a convo isn't creepy
"Again if they think it is, that's really on them"
"Who cares? Of she thinks you are cute or funny, she will engage"
If not move on

I can’t cry for long periods of time because I start overthinking the fact that I’m crying and I’m way too aware of everything I’m doing. Normal?

"get a new medication there are plenty of other adhd drugs that can help you focus

side note i had to reread like 4 times i was stun reading that you drink to take Adderall that's nuts lol"
Adderall isn’t the same anymore
A lot of adhd meds don’t feel the same
I’m sorry you’ve had to go through all of this
Good job not drinking
It sounds like you were medicating the unwanted side effects of perhaps too high a dose using the depressive effects of alcohol
Maybe I’m wrong though
Have you tried playing with the dose/cutting out caffeine/etc? Also the pec tightness might be an anxiety symptom but it might be worth doing a stress test with a cardiologist
"I used to get this & had one done before I would start on any stimulants because I was convinced I had a heart problem but it was just anxiety/weird muscle spasms.

Anyway good job not drinking and be careful with your brain’s association between your meds and alcohol"
I recommend using the next couple weeks to experiment with a lower dose.
Do you drink coffee or caffeine with it?
"I’ve not tried Adderall, but I’ll either take stimulants or drink (or other depressants), I’ve never felt the need for both"
Hell the craving to drink doesn’t happen till the stims wear off…
Try a new drug?
I’m not proud of it
It felt like the only way I could keep pushing in school
I’ve tried pretty much every ADHD med due to me trying to get rid of the uncomfortable feeling I get.
I appreciate it
I’ve gone to a cardiologist and had a heart monitor for a month because I was convinced I had screwed up my heart and they found nothing
I take an anxiety med at night as well
I’ve played with the dosage a 100 different way
I’ve taken the beads out and just swallowed those and I have a 10mg IR as well and it consistently seems to do the same thing
I feel like I don’t get the super focus at a low dosage either
"I really appreciate your advice!

I could just have the wrong idea of how focused I should be and have been taking too large of a dose all along or not waiting for it to kick in."
No - I never do
The most annoying symptom is the weird chest feeling I get but my heart has been checked out.
The pain could be precordial catch syndrome
I would consider asking your doctor about taking a break and retitrating slowly in your next 2 weeks
 Also with doc supervision you could try adding some supplements to offset your side effects
"Some have had success with magnesium

Edit: I had put if you are a woman it could be precordial catch syndrome, but I didn’t realize it affects men and women"

I just don't know  what to do anymore

Stopping helped me
It's good for a quick serotonin boost
"I believe it’s good to go some days without it, it definitely makes it better the longer you go without.

I believe you may be right, it can help focus"
"By removing pleasure sometimes, the smallest things become more enjoyable, and those things we do without become amazing once reintroduced.

That’s all fine and dandy until you run into someone you are attracted to while doing a dry run.

I find that it becomes a wee bit harder to concentrate on the situation at hand.

If this is working for you, I say you’re doing great!"
"I do not know about focus 

But i did do it sometimes when feeling overwhelmed, then i will feel less overwhelmed and less noise in my head… its important there to make a plan or figure out what i want to do with my day during this short time of relief or else i will get overwhelmed again"

I had to start forcing myself to eat breakfast
The dizziness/lightheaded feeling was awful and I couldn’t take it anymore
I was also getting really bad headaches that would turn into migraines
"I’ve found that if I drink a liquid IV and eat at least a banana and some toast before taking my meds, I have a much better day"
I also don’t crash as hard once it wears off.
Very important for me
My brain doesn’t really start until breakfast
Getting enough calories everyday is more important though
"Your brain burns calories too! Feed it and give your ADHD meds their best shot at helping you out.

And yes, if you’re feeling lightheaded at the end of everyday, you should be eating more!"
Even when I sleep in (this is embarrassing to say but I am receiving a severance from a past job and all I really do now is hang out at home and job hunt) so I sleep in until noon sometimes
" I’ve worked since I was 14, I’m 50 now so enjoying this break"
 So even if I get up at noon my body still wants coffee and a bagel or cereal so I eat it
 I’ll then eat a lunch size meal at 2-3 then dinner around 7
 I’m really off my normal schedule but I just don’t feel good if I skip breakfast and just go into lunch mode
My body must need that caffeine and carbs to wake you up and get going
To answer the title question: I don't feel overloaded by stimulants when I eat breakfast and regularly throughout the day
I often have to make a conscious effort to eat a piece of bread and butter
"

I've found that I usually enjoy savory foods for breakfast rather than sweet"
"This often means eating foods that my mother scoffs are ""not breakfast."" Last week I had Alfredo for breakfast and it was delicious."
Prep easy to microwave food or buy freezer stuff
I’m a fan of egg bites and waffles
"Set 20 minute timers, take pill, make breakfast and eat when it dings"
Don’t allow yourself to go to the next step until you eat.
I don’t like eating breakfast very much either
I make a chai latte with a full 8 oz steamed milk and collagen powder to get some protein in to start my day so I’m not starving and to make sure I have something going before I get down solid food
Sometimes I also have some toast or eggs but if I forget to eat at least I’m not completely going on nothing all morning.
I HAD to start eating something in the morning because my meds murder my stomach with no food in it
But I've found i can eat a very small amount of high protein things and it does the job
Usually it's a slice of cheese or a gogurt
Then I live on coffee the rest of the day
Lol
But seriously just that slice of cheese makes a world of difference in my mood and my energy.
I'm pretty much the same
"No appetite in the mornings, at worst even the thought of food makes me slightly nauseous"
"Used to skip breakfast/lunch and got more nauseous and lightheaded until I got some bad hunger pangs and was forced to eat (at this point eating once again seemed almost repulsive).

Now that I take meds all that is even worse (especially the lightheadedness and side effects from meds) so I just force myself in the morning"
The negative physical feelings are my main motivator
I know I just have to do that one uncomfortable thing in the morning and I will feel so much better the rest of the day
"I am also more likely to eat during the day if I have breakfast since I feel better and have energy to cook, without breakfast it's often 0 appetite.

Here are some tips that work for me:

* protein shakes (liquid is easier to get down, I use oat milk which feels easier to drink)
* just try to get a few bites down, you might feel more like eating once you start
* drink water or tea after waking up (chamomile or anything light and herbal makes eating easier), drink more during the day also
* decide the previous day what you will eat and get stuff ready so you have to make minimal effort in the morning (I mean prepwork or gathering ingredients)
* easy to make stuff like yogurt with berries, sandwiches, reheating leftovers, fruit
* less fatty foods when I feel nauseous, otherwise eggs/bacon/toast/fresh tomatoes are my usual go to"
"If you dont like *eating* breakfast, then *drink* it"
"Same for during the day, have yoghurt drinks, protein shakes, meal drinks, smoothies, or soup"
Easy to make and can sip slowly.
most are not the healthiest but goingball day until dinner with no food is worse...
I’m in a breakfast routine where I eat a bowl of cereal no matter what
Almost always cheerios
"Could be a little bowl, could be a big bowl, just depends how I feel, but it says to me that the day has started"
I feel more ready to interpret information
"Without that its like I’m dreaming all morning, nothing gets saved."
You NEED to take you breakfast with some protein and avoid citrus food with most ADHD medication
"  
  
If you have a hard time eating in the morning **get a blender.** 

Mix some banana with oats, milk(or alternative) and for example some Cacao and sweetener"
"  
(banana chocolate smoothie)

**The ''hack'' here is to drink it right away before the oats ''absorb'' the moisture"
"This way you eat(drink) a lot with your body thinking you only had something light!** 

This actually made me realise I forgot my breakfast, thanks."
My meds run out of gas in a couple hours if I don't eat a protein breakfast
They just plain stop working.
Easy fix for me was to just buy a case of the 30mg Muscle Milk protein shakes
"It's super difficult for me to think about eating those first few hours after waking up & taking my meds, but drinking one or two of those will start your day off right with some protein & vitamins"
"Not a total substitute for food, mind you, but it will give your body something to work with until lunch & when you're not on that initial stimulant peak of the morning"
"It's just easier for me to *drink* something rather than eat something first thing in the morning, may work for you & help with that awful crash at the end of the day."
"I've fallen out of the habit of eating breakfast too, it's so hard"
"but I remember what an impact it had on me years ago, long before I realized i had a ✨️spicy brain✨️, I was in a program at school that I enjoyed, but it also gave me anxiety like I'd never experienced before"
for the first few weeks I was too nervous to eat and never ate before school
"once I started forcing myself to eat breakfast, I was so much better equipped to handle the stress and anxiety, not to mention the physical demand of the program"
it was a huge game changer
"

hmm"
maybe I should start eating breakfast again.
"I HATE eating breakfast but when I don’t my symptoms are soo much worse: can’t focus, negative thoughts, etc"
Protein bars when I get to work but switching up the brand and flavor frequently is where I’m at right now but I don’t love it
"I literally cannot function without breakfast because I feel like a car with no fuel, once I do get fuel I can run"
I literally didn't eat til 530 today
I am failing.
I gained 20 lbs.
I’m in the no breakfast club too
"I have weird work hours so I’m up at 4:30 to walk my dog, have my first cup of coffee and get into the proper headspace for work"
At 5:30 take my first round of adderall and follow it up with a second cup of coffee in the car as I drive to work
I work for four hours
"Then if I don’t have any appointments, come home and nap and eat lunch"
(Cereal usually) then it’s back to work and a second booster dose
And then I finally eat a real meal at dinner
"

For as long as I can remember, I never really had breakfast"
Just a cup of coffee before school
"Even as a small child, I was drinking coffee and not having breakfast."
Eating something first thing when you wake up is one of the things that starts the clock on your circadian rhythm
It sets the countdown for when you start getting tired for bed.
Eating breakfast only helps me if I’m eating something protein-filled and nourishing
If I eat anything super sugary or heavy on carbs it’ll render me useless even with my medication
I don't make any excuses and I just remind myself to eat because I know that's one of the side effects
Hold yourself accountable bro
I will let you know.
I recommend Sustagen or Up'n'go if either of those are available to you
"Decent calories that you can suck easily through a straw - when I or my kids don't feel like eating but I know we need the input, the liquid breakfast (not the alcoholic kind) is usually tolerable."
Important note: it doesn’t have to be “breakfast” (which has so many steps) so long as it’s “eat something”
"I find it REALLY difficult to drag myself into the kitchen, decide what to eat, prepare it, and then eat it, right after I’ve woken up"
"Instead I keep protein bars or breakfast bars by my bed so I can just wake up, take meds, chug some water and eat a protein bar, and then it’s all done"
Usually I’ll make breakfast an hour later when the meds kick in and I can do things without thinking about them
I notice a huge difference whenever I run out of snack bars and take meds on an empty stomach for a few days
I feel so much better just having eaten something. 
"you should definitely eat something, especially if you’re lightheaded by the time you do eat"
"that’s a sign that you’re starving your body and brain.

honestly, get some protein bars"
"that’s what i do, i take my meds and eat a protein bar"
it helps kickstart my appetite so i don’t go all day without eating
"(i also get sick if i don’t eat within an hour-ish of waking up) grab one from the kitchen when i go to bed and set it on my nightstand with my meds and water, so i don’t have to leave my bedroom until i’m fueled"
you could also just store the box in your bedroom if you want.
"I've always eaten breakfast and I feel sick if I don't, so even when I'm alone and nobody can prepare it for me, I still try to eat some loaves of bread or just anything so at least I don't feel nauseous"
Next time I'll be home alone I should really try preparing breakfast the night before so that I can eat decently in the morning.
Fewer hypoglycemic episodes.
"i literally cannot function without breakfast, It's very important to me to get a nice big breakfast to start my day"
"I've noticed that high protein foods boost my mood and energy levels much more throughout the day, so instead of just breads and cereals, I've opted for rice and chicken (very commonly sold breakfast in my country)"
"its a bit costly, but as a budget substitute i just load up a sandwich with eggs, cold cuts or processed meat and wash down with milk"
"any breakfast is better than no breakfast, even if its just biscuits, i found that i stay much more energized throughout the day if i eat something, also helps to control overeating during lunch and dinner.

edit: summarizing the differences i notice if i dont eat breakfast:

- very unstable mood, cant even pretend to be happy
- unable to focus on anything at all, tune out of most things and I'm barely conscious in my own world
- will pass out on severe occasions
- entire body feels like its weighed down
- nausea (side effect from bloating)
- jittery hands
- heavy craving for sugar
- binge eating dinner
- stomach ache in the middle of the night due to the binge eating

found out all of these the hard way when i was struggling for cash and during a very difficult mental health phase"
also was starved when a school activity didn't allow students to eat breakfast even after waking them up at 6am so i just passed out in front of everyone 🙃
I joke that my stomach doesn't wake up until lunch
I actually feel ill if I get up too early or try to eat too early :( I hate it.
energy level sustained
I have protein heavy and light carb breakfast
Gets my day going but if I have heavy carb I feel bloated and struggle to start
"

If I have no carb though it doesn’t carry me through to the next meal."
I started the food rampage earlier in the day T_T
I've been skipping breaky for most of my life
It turns my stomach on I want to eat all day. 
"I don’t like to eat in the mornings, but I don’t mind a smoothie"
I make them with vegan protein powder
It helps keep me full during the day and makes my meds work a lot better
"There for a while I thought my meds weren’t working anymore, but it was just that I needed to eat when I take them."
Do..
"do y'all not even eat a lil snacky? You never wake up in the middle of the night and have to give your brain a fig newton? A sip of juice? I swear my body wakes me up if I don't have enough energy to keep dreaming, gotta eat a peanut butter pretzel about it so I can go back to sleep"
"

I currently eat a packet of oatmeal for breakfast but I think I'm going to switch back to something with more protein"
"The fiber helps wake me up for sure, but I think I did better with tofu or egg bites."
"I delay eating until around an hour after taking my meds because it works better for me that way, but if I don't put food into my body during the day I feel like shit by 5pm and can't get anything done after that point"
"Feeling exhausted and lightheaded is you depriving your brain of energy and nutrients it needs to function during your daily activities, and stimulants acting as an override to push you through until you hit that exhaustion point and fizzle out"
"You'd also feel like crap unmedicated if you didn't eat anything during the day.

I do struggle with getting myself to take breaks from working and get a proper lunch in front of me, but I make up for it by having protein bars and shakes, drinkable yogurt, fruits and nuts, smoothies etc easy-to-shove-down foods available and easily accessible while I'm busy.

When you eat, you have more stable physical and mental energy levels through the day, your meds work more evenly, and you don't hit a wall hard later in the day."
"Stimulants do this to me as well.

I would just say, start slowly"
 Try a handful of nuts or a boiled egg and build up from there
 Make sure it’s protein to control blood sugar and stabilize the absorption of your meds
 This in turn will help control your appetite. 
"My meds, make me forget to eat or rather I don’t really have any desire to"
Which has been fantastic in losing some weight but I am also and endurance athlete and I notice that most of my runs now do seem to be a little harder because of that
"I am in a slow quiet training phase now, but in a few weeks when I crank it up for the season, I will have to make sure I am eating properly which I guess means setting alerts on my phone to remind me to eat"
Never thought I would have that problem.
"I'm not sure how to convince you if you feel lightheaded on the days you don't eat before dinner - focusing on how bad it must be if it's that apparent maybe?

A quick google says high protein and good fats are what's good"
So maybe just start with a spoonful of peanut butter late morning?
I just started on Ritalin and had a bad episode of Vertigo
Made me realize I need to start eating more and probably best to have something for breakfast as well
"It's not easy, but it's worth it."
Unironically- I don't feel insane
"I've always been a bfast person so I can't say much on the not hungry part, but I do notice I think clearer once I eat"
"Even if it's a glass of water and a quick protein bar / shake / smoothie, something is better than nothing"
Maybe start your mornings with a little bit your fav snack just to get your body expecting food in the morning- on mornings I'm not hungry I usually have a bit of candy and I'm starving half an hr later
"Bfast also kickstarts metabolism and your internal clock, which your hormones rely on, so emotional and physical regulation is dependent on that"
"Your brain needs SO MUCH glucose to function, so not providing any via diet means you're likely pulling from other stores to generate the glucose you need to function, which actually requires more energy from your body and might be messing with your energy that way too."
"I hate eating g in the morning and find, for me, the greatest and clearest mind days I have are when I don’t eat until after 1500-1700ish"
 I find my body prefers small meals spread out
 But I am still drinking my morning coffee(s) which don’t seem too distracting for me
" If I do end up eating, I feel it slows my brain down giving me more fog and less clarity."
"Hi there, random question for you all"
How did you manage to get diagnosed and given medication? I called so many places to try and schedule with a psychologist and no one has reached back out
I’m so frustrated
Seems like everyone is booked up and I need help.
"I mean I never stopped, breakfast is the first thing I do when I finally get up from bed

Recently, I make it while listening to the daily show on YouTube"
I usually take my medication either 1 hour after breakfast or 30-40 minutes after breakfast
"

Both seem to hedge against the worst side effects of the medication, but I find the I feel better for longer when I eat first, then take the meds an hour later"
"

If I take the meds too soon after eating, I find the meds don't tend to work as well."
"I just have a small smoothie & protein powder, I’m never hungry early morning, but I do make a point of not taking the meds on an empty stomach"
Extremely vitally important
"In fact, I won't take my medicine unless I have it with breakfast"
It metabolizes better with protein
I never skip lunch or dinner either
I don't eat massive meals either but the constant food intake massively helps to regulate my energy/emotions/focus/etc.
I try my hardest to have a protein heavy breakfast right when I take my adderall otherwise most days I don’t eat til lunch.
I started gaining weight
"So, I stopped"
Came right off.
"Anything is better than nothing, grab some granola bars and take them with you everywhere.
Stuff thats doesn't need work and you can take with you/ leave in your bag without any trouble."
I do a meal replacement drink every morning! I do one with higher protein
I used to do the ones with more calories in them because I was not eating enough but now I'm at a comfortable weight
"Highly recommend them, I'd even bring one for lunch if needed"
"

I order boost right now on Amazon and it's a subscription so I don't even have to remember to order it."
I haven't eaten breakfast regularly in 40 plus years
"I've only been recently diagnosed, and on medication, but even the last few years of being on medication I don't eat breakfast"
"

I'm not hungry in the morning, which is a shame because I love breakfast food"
But I never have a problem making it until lunch
"

Oftentimes I'll have a late lunch, and make it my only meal, if I'm trying to lose weight"
Otherwise I just eat a normal lunch and a light dinner
"

So I guess it just depends on how the medications affect you, or how you're feeling"
Listen to your body!
I don’t feel like complete utter shit and can concentrate better
"That’s a given though, eat to fuel your body and give it energy for the day"
Our brains need it
"My meds are just a collateral.

Of course, a meal with more protein works better compared to, say, a bowl of honey bunches, but I feel that’s also no surprise lol"
I DO however have to make sure I eat within 20 minutes or similar to you my appetite is blown for the day.
I gained 80lbs in ten months.
Singing the Liquid IV praises over here too! So important to get electrolytes.
Wait this actually sounds lovely
"Don’t let the guilt tripping voice get to you & enjoy your well-deserved break, friend"
You’ve worked hard enough.
"As a kid (and still now), leftover pizza from last night = today's breakfast."
"You know when they say ""best is fed"" for babies about breastfeeding vs bottle feeding? The same thing applies for my adult self and breakfast"
"Leftover mac'n cheese, Half a can of chickpeas with lemon juice and salt, lasagna, oatmeal cookies, cheese and salami, these are all breakfast to me"
"

I struggle so much to eat in the morning, if I have to discriminate against breakfast food vs non breakfast food I would never make it to lunch."
"welcome to asian breakfast, most if not all of our breakfasts are quite savory"
"one of my favorites is a simple salmon rice bowl, or sandwiches with cold cuts, eggs and a singular leaf of salad 😂"
"I have been having a hard boiled egg, an egg bite (egg, cheese, meat), or even just a protein shake"
"If I am feeling hungry, also a bowl of cereal"
But that protein boost is huge
Makes my day so much easier
"

About an hour before bed, I often have a slice of cheese (mmmm cheese 🤤) to take with my magnesium and fish oil"
"It's small and it means I don't have to go to sleep on a completely empty stomach.

I do struggle with hydration, though, all day every day"
"I have mio flavoring, electrolyte packets, etc"
I don't hate water I just struggle to remember! And it also has such an impact on my day with meds.
ohh bless you for the protein shake tip
i didn't think of that
i started meds and i eat even less now than before:( i will buy protein powder today !!!
Muscle or fat? Were you skinny and trying to gain or was it unwanted?
Absolutely! It definitely makes a HUGE difference in how I feel throughout the day.
oh yeah it was a real life savior for me!
Fat! Just fat
Pure fat
From healthy weight to severely obese
Luckily I've since lost a lot of it..
But not all
And yes
I skip breakfast now.

52M AuDHD comorbid with severe anxiety
"Diagnosed earlier this year.

I spent a year or so on Lexapro after work instability induced major depression and anxiety"
"While it was useful at the time, I was very eager to get rid of it.

Since starting Vyvanse (50mg) it's mostly been my experience that I don't directly know it's there and working - I notice when it's worn off"
"The largest change I've noticed is that because it helps me with focus on tasks which have caused me anxiety (because I couldn't start them, or if I could start, then I couldn't finish), my anxiety related to those things has decreased"
"

Unfortunately my work anxiety has massively increased in the last 6 weeks because my company has had a round of layoffs and my part of the org has lost 1/3 - and I'm part of the leadership team picking up the pieces.

When I was in highschool, the meds available for kids who had ADHD were definitely awful and numbed you"
However in the 40 years since then our understanding of brain chemistry and the pharmaceutical industry's ability to craft more carefully targeted drugs with lower side effects means that we have many more ADHD medication options available
"While it's certainly possible a particular ADHD med could make you numb, there's more than one option so you can go back to your treating doctor and ask for something else."
ADHD medication made me feel like my black and white world went to color
" I am happy, funny, charismatic, focused, and balanced"
" Some meds made me feel numb, which I couldn’t tolerate, but Mydayis helps me the best"
 It’s all about finding your right med combo and it often takes time and figuring out changes with your provider when necessary
" Welcome to the club!  Drink a lot of water, eat a lot of protein, try L-tyrosine, magnesium, a good multi, and you’ll be fine!"

Anyone know of small vibrating fidgets/relaxation tools for managing overstimulation?

This sounds like more of a communication and awareness issue
Wait for a window of opportunity to talk with her openly about this when she’s not agitated or focused on another task
Tell her that you are happy to help out with whatever she needs but if she’d be a little more patient or able to communicate the urgency of her request you can respond more appropriately
"She may not realize how it seems like she’s demanding things of you, so gently nudge her and see if she starts being more mindful of how and when she’s making these requests."
"Intellectually, it seems like you understand the why behind the ADHD behavior, which is awesome and puts you ahead of many people in ADHD relationships (including the ADHD people!)"
"So, I'll venture a guess that part of the issue for you is maybe the way your girlfriend is requesting things (the tone of her voice, body language, volume, urgency, choice of words)"
"As you correctly surmised, she's probably worried that whatever she's asking of you won't get done at all"
"Alternatively, what she may be experiencing is what I call the lynchpin task"
This is a task that keeps me from doing all other tasks
Accomplishing this task will allow me to keep working and finish all other projects
"It's this barrier that I need to remove, and ideally, it would happen immediately because it's holding up the works"
"And it really sucks that I need another person to accomplish this task, as I wish I could do it alone, but I can't, so here we are"
"

So this is where you, the non-ADHD partner--or rather, the partner with executive functioning--can help reduce anxiety for the both of you, as well as putting up and maintaining boundaries for your own piece of mind"
"

First off, does she ask you to do something or tell you to do something? Saying, ""hey, can you go take out the garbage,"" is different from, ""take out the garbage, it's trash day."" If she's asking, it's a request, not a demand, and you can respond with something like, ""hey, thanks for the reminder"
"I will take it out after I ____ (complete this task, finish this show, do this thing)."" That way, you're acknowledging the information as well as giving her a timeframe for when the task gets done"
The key is following through
"Do you do that? I don't mean to be rude or anything, but speaking from experience, part of the reason why people with ADHD have urgency around their asks of others has to do with others not following through"
"Can she trust that you'll take care of things in a timely fashion? 

Secondly, if your GF is phrasing her asks as demands, the conversation around that can be tricky, but that's true for most couples and people, it's not specific to ADHD"
"So, in a moment when neither of you are stressed out or busy, ask to have a conversation and use ""I"" messages:

""Hey, babe, I hope you know that I want to help you in any way I can"
"I was giving it some thought, and when I hear someone telling me to do something, it makes me feel on edge"
"I feel pressured to perform, and it makes me not want to"
"It would help if it came across like the person was asking for a favor, instead of giving me a direction."" I know, it's wordy, and you might lose the person's attention"
"But it's helpful when you want to work to change behaviors.

 I'd also honestly suggest text messages"
"As a person with ADHD, I love having something written to come back to"
"What did you ask me to get from the store? Boom, I can pull it up in my messages"
What time is that birthday party? Search in conversation
"I can also look at when I ask for something to get done and how long it actually takes my husband to do it, and vice versa"
It keeps us accountable.
It’s something I’ve worked on with my partner on my “immediate” items
"It takes effort, but start by calmly asking her if it needs to be done now or if it can wait"
"If it needs to be done now, start doing it (keep everyone calm in case of panic), but nicely ask (at a calm moment) “when did you *first* know this needed to be done?” Most often, when I was asked these questions by my partner, I began putting it together that I need to communicate these things “as I become aware of them” instead of “once I’m reminded of them.” Then, I practiced (and failed - lots), but have gotten better so this doesn’t happen as frequently as it did"
"It still happens sometimes, but within range of any other normal person I suppose"
"It also helped me realize that sometimes my “immediate” thing isn’t really a need, but a presentation of my impulsivity, making it a want"
"This kind of stuff stuff wasn’t something I was ever personally aware of or intentionally doing, but I don’t know that I was aware of it (or even could have been aware) had these questions not be asked."
My ADHD means that I don't trust my brain
It has proven again and again to be entirely unreliable
"Instead, I trust (mostly) my systems for capturing tasks and remembering to do things at certain times"
"Because of the relationship I have with my brain, I don't necessarily trust other people's brains either"
"So, when there's something that I need my partner to do, I can't really ""let go"" of it until I know for certain that it has been or will be done"
This might mean I watch him put said thing into his digital planner or set an alarm
Then I can relax about that task
"

I guess where I'm going with this is that it may be a trust thing (not because you're not a good person, but because people are fallible!) If you can prove time and again that you will, in fact, take out the trash after you finish your video game (for example), your girlfriend may find it easier to wait."

"I think it used to be that in-person appointments were required for controlled substance refills, but the requirement for in-person was temporarily changed to allow telehealth because of covid"
"I think it’s been extended for another year or something like that? 

I moved to another state recently and unfortunately ran out of meds before I could find a psychiatrist (still waiting on my referral)"
I also looked at online options but found that most popular telehealth platforms don’t prescribe controlled substances or don’t accept insurance
"if you’d still like to try that route though, donefirst.com was one I came across"
"but my advice is to print all your prescription records and documentation of adhd diagnosis, try to find a primary care provider with sooner availability, and ask if they can refill your prescriptions until you’re able to get ahold of a psychiatrist."
Thank you! I’ll def check out donefirst! Unfortunately the earliest appointment with a PCP I could get was for March :( seems like wait times for anything in-person are just all horrible where I live lol

No
You probably won't be as sedated from your Xanax but it will still have the same anxiolytic properties.
I read somewhere that taking benzos after stimulants is actually neuro protective because they kind of have opposite effects
"However you could get into a gnarly cycle pretty quickly if you have to take a benzo everyday just to cope with the stimulant. If you’re having anxiety that badly it’s probably not a good fit for you or your dose is too high.

To actually answer your question, when I took adhd meds with Xanax I felt completely flat."
like I had virtually no thoughts going through my mind
I sat outside for a while just taking in how strange it felt and then I power mopped my patio
"So both meds worked, just didn’t really work well together if that makes sense. 

The best way to use both in a day is to take your adhd med and then when you start to crash take the anxiety med"
Make sure you’re eating and staying hydrated
Sometimes I start to get really anxious and realize it’s because I haven’t eaten all day and feel all of the symptoms of hunger except the desire to eat
Stimuli can also make you anxious or hyper vigilant. 
You can take Xanax at night to wind down but that’s not a drug you want to be on for much time…

I actually can’t do anything

Can you talk to your school guidance counselor? The love getting involved
"hang in there❤️

I still get stuck and can’t keep my brain from shutting down"
sometimes doing a cardio workout or even taking a walk helps with stress and when your mind is racing
"is there anything that calms you down or helps quiet your mind—music, listening to a podcast, a creative activity?

when I get stuck, it also overrides all my coping mechanisms so sometimes just accepting it and trying again tomorrow is all I can do"
"taking the pressure off can help, just being patient with yourself instead of constantly trying to fight against your brain"
"it’s like when you can’t fall asleep and get stressed out about not sleeping.

sometimes I feel like my brain is a toddler I’m babysitting"
all I can do is let it do its thing and try to guide it along the way.
Hey I'm going through the same thing
"I know how hard it can be, especially when no one seems to understand us"
I'm currently waiting to be tested for ADHD and I think you should consider getting tested
"In the meantime, I've found that breaking tasks into as small as possible and taking it one step at a time can make things abit easier"
"Also, it could help to change your environment and instead of studying at home, go to a library"
These the few things that have somewhat helped me and could help you
"

But please do speak to a specialist and get tested then go from there"
I will be doing the same

I think my 7 year old son has it and it breaks my heart so much
I don’t let him see it but his struggles make me extremely sad

"For example, these days He has this obsession with locks and keys"
"He is constantly locking/unlocking doors, playing with keys etc"
he often damages the doors and walls of our house in the process
Not a big deal but I don’t know how to may be divert his attention

"I don't understand why ""they"" ""made"" your parents disown you? That sounds very sad and strange"
My school never did anything like that to me or my classmates.
Have you ever looked up the term 'Polymath'? It sure seems to describe a lot of people with ADD/ADHD
"

And would mean that it's the teachers who suck and not the students.

And then, how many kids are being drugged when the teachers just don't have a clue how to teach them?"
"Oh man I was the other way around, did really well in k-12 cause I thrived on the structure of school and completely lost it at uni"
I am a teacher in high school now lols and I don’t thrive with the admin tasks.
"It's the system of how schools work and what they teach us.

At least india and especially the private schools won't focus on developing moral values and shit like that ain't no way so many students commit suicide just because of a goddamn exam(JEE/NEET).

I just hate school they killed my interest I was depressed in school; had toxic friends, teachers always used to judge me"
"They made my parents disown me at a point😭

Even my parents don't understand me I have always felt alone and left out."
It's actually the engineering colleges
"Most are illegal and also don't provide industry relevant knowledge and skills and also the indian parents want they kids to become engineers JUST TO MAKE MONEY not because they like to make shit or engineers can help develop country.

Parents make they kids selfish"
?
"I know I like STEM I want to get a phd in physics(computational)

Although the concepts like calculus maybe hard but it is doable if u or I just dedicate enough time for it and destroying calculus ass is in my bucket list 🪣 📜 

And about the education system in india it's just marks and I can study my way to get good grades(if I have time flexibility which I do now).

And also schools here only focus on engineering/medicine and marks"
"Character building, developing civic sense, teaching how to respect women and shit like that isn't taught in our schools especially private schools and that's why we have so many registered and unregistered rape cases, road rage cases and shit like that.

I have been thru a lot and seen a lot"
"I just want to be a good person and keep learning and do something for my country or people(in the village area)

I don't give a shit about money and success I aim to develop values

Albert the oldies Einstein once said ""strive not to be a success but to be of value""

Rest up my old man 💪🏽"
It's india so...
"I was a substitute for a while- one of the schools had three hour long class blocks, and I thought I was going to crawl out of my skin!"
me too
Making money is a reasonable thing to do
 It sounds pretty important in a poorer country like India.
I’m just indicating I agree that schools aren’t for us.
"Unfortunately, cultural norms and ethical values can be restricted geographically"
Just look at “honor” killings and other dress code brutalities in staunch Islamic areas
"

Be the change you want to be"
"

So long as the caste system exists in India, there is no equality"
If there’s no equality in a general sense IE we are humans and we should be equal to other humans
You can’t expect to change the inequality women face in India
"Just look at the US, even they can’t give their women equal rights for abortion"
"

If you’re stuck there, then work hard get yourself out of the system in good standing and you can work towards going to another place where you’ll experience a different life/societal norms"
"

Every place, has their own quirks, positives and negatives"
You may think going to Australia might be a nice change
But you’ll also have a good chance of experiencing racism and stereotyping here
"

School is important, just do your best and have a plan on where you want to be and what kind of life you want to live"
"

Then go for it"
"

Good luck"
You can be whatever you want
Nicola Tesla didn’t go to school he just worked in a  bookstore so he could read all the books and then he completely revolutionized the way people thought about electricity
"I am a sub 😅 3 hours would end me, for sure."
india ain't poor and there are other ways to make money(maybe follow ur passion)
You'll be surprised to know that gamers in india make more than engineers graduate from the top institute in india
And engineers don't make money they solve problems that's what they do and that's what people don't understand
"

Money is important I know but there's more to life than just that you can be a geologist or meteorologist or something like that or help people or something.

Fucking hate these people they only think of themselves"
👍🏽
India is hindu
His parents prolly didn't care but my parents do
I just want to get into a college and then I'll study all the shit I want.
Making money is very difficult for plenty of people
 A lot of passions don't make money.
✊
Ik
But you don't always gotta be an engineer bruhh

My Pharmacy at home used to do this for most of their patients
 Anyone who was elderly or had ADHD would just need to mention it once and she’d make up blistering packs and even have it delivered to the house every time
I never missed a dose back then and I didn’t realise I could just buy them! I have refillable plastic ones but they’re just not as good somehow
I’ll be looking for these for my early morning pills
That's great
Now I need to remember to order these blisters packs.

"[""Hyperfocus"" is a very poorly-defined word](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00426-019-01245-8) that, in the context of ADHD, generally refers to two superficially similar -- but fundamentally different -- mental states: flow and perseveration.

Flow is a positive, beneficial state of deep immersion and high engagement in a task or activity, and is also usually accompanied by enjoyment of the task/activity"
"It's something almost all people are capable of, and specifically is not a benefit imparted by ADHD"
"

Perseveration, on the other hand, is part of the ADHD disorder"
It is the inability to switch between tasks or mental activities
"It's that thing that makes you spend 10 hours doing something non-stop even when you know you need to stop and do something else.

But also: isn’t this a question for your doctor or prescriber?"
"How long have you been taking 40mg? When I got bumped from 20mg Adderall XR to 30, this is *exactly* how I felt"
You described it perfectly
"Work felt great, rather than getting overwhelmed I looked forward to new emails and tasks coming in"
"When 12pm rolled around I didn't want to get lunch and ruin my flow state...

  
But this did not last more than maybe a week and a half...and when that euphoria went so did like 80% of the focus benefits I was getting"
"To the point where I'm seeing my doctor next week about potentially trying Vyvanse because I'm simply not getting the improvements I need.

  
Moral of the story...if you just upped your dose give it a few weeks and see how you feel."

Omg
This is what I am dealing with too
We need our own support group 🥹
"Yes, we do! Sorry you are going through this."
I had a meeting last week with the VP at school and asked what resources the school has - they have some that they will introduce my kid to - had I known this I would have pushed for this ages ago
Apparently my kid is a good kid and flies below the radar
"
We’ve also just recently tried a med change from a stimulant to straterra"
We’re on week 2 of that
"
My biggest challenge is getting him to school"
He won’t do therapy anymore
"
We’re going to have a follow up meeting at the school next week with him, which is going to be a mid term reality check where he sees what work he hasn’t complete"
"
Give me a dozen toddlers to wrangle any day"
I’ll take it
This is brutal.
Same
"Today was one of those days where I spent most of it telling myself he’s a good kid having a hard time, and this phase will pass"
"😟
My ex has reached out to a friend who’s a pediatrician that specializes in adhd and I’ll share any insight we get."
Yes they are good kids! I would definitely be interested in hearing what the pediatrician has to say
Thank you!

"Finding your rhythm takes time, but it gets easier"
Just focus on small wins.
"Crashing into this new reality is hard, but manageable if you know your limits and develop the right strategies.

You mentioned talking to new people"
Socializing is gonna suck until it doesn't
"Be kind to yourself, but push forward, and keep in mind that people tend to mature into abandoning the high school mentality of ""being popular"" and ""avoiding cringe"", but some don't, so avoid the latter.

Don't force yourself into doing what works for others"
"You're an adult now and most professors will treat you like so, so make your own decisions"
"I decided that attending classes frequently wasn't for me; many professors are very boring and their didactics suck, so it was actually easier for me to learn with other methods instead of forcing myself to get 100% attendance"
"Videos and textbooks worked, but the real banger was group studying with my friends"
"But what worked for me might not work for you, so experiment.

For the love of god, use a calendar, post-its, tattoo it on your wrist, I don't care, but DO NOT rely on your memory to remember assignment deadlines and test dates"
"It's like not wearing a seatbelt: it takes one accident to fuck you up.

I can count on my hand the amount of people I know with no flukes and mostly excellent grades, and they're unquestionably geniuses"
A few of my friends were honestly pretty bad students and still got successful -- they had enough passion to get into extra activities and network with the right people
"Some failure is reasonable, expected, and not a big deal if you chose the right career for you.

Learn about the laws and rules that can support you"
"Here, people with ADHD have the right to receive extra time on tests"
"Teachers here are usually considerate too, and can grant you things like extra time on assignments.

Oh, and I love chemistry"
Especially organic.

2021: 10mg to 28mg ATX, TCA.

I have a tub of vanilla yoghurt with a scoop of chocolate protein powder mixed in

"Super easy to do, and if you add cottage cheese (just use a blender if you do) you can get a lot of protein in each."
Can you drink a protein smoothie before you leave for work or take it with you?
I don't
I take them on an empty stomach
They work better for me.
"I'm still weighing the pros and cons between taking Vyvanse on an empty stomach and taking it with some high protein beef jerky and water when I wake up.

Some people also take their meds early in the morning and then go back to sleep, I don't set disruptive alarms at 5 AM or anything, I just sometimes take my meds early and go back to sleep when the opportunity presents itself, and this morning was my first ""Vyvanse nap"" in months"
I woke up ready to clean my entire house and organize my Google Calendar and fight God himself if necessary.
"If you are going back to bed, I think based on personal experience I can recommend taking the meds with a few sips of water on an empty stomach so that you don't wake up your digestive tract any more than necessary, since that can make it harder to return to sleep , I have heard.

Another variable is stomach acid breaking down certain amphetamine compounds, I'm not sure if stomach acid breaks down meds more when you do or don't have a little bit of food in your stomach, like, does your stomach add more acid when it detects food? Or is the acid single mindedly focused on attacking your Adderall if it's the only thing in your stomach? Clearly I don't know enough about stomachs or acid to give any advice on this matter, but I have been occasionally taking Tums anti-acid with my Adderall or Vyvanse and I haven't noticed major differences."
"Greek yogurt made into a parfait, or a Ka’chava protein/ super healthy ingredients, and a multivitamin basically, all In one I add some extra protein powder a little extra kale and some frozen mixed berries and it goes down super easy on meds when I don’t want food and I feel full for quite awhile and feel like it gives me plenty of energy my days definitely feel markably different on days I don’t drink them."
"No, always on an empty stomach"
"Most meds work better that way, I thought."
"Yes always or I get v swimmy, floaty, light headed and lose all access to motivation"
Protein before every dose.

"It could be unwise advice to follow when the other party has it in for you!


Be up front with him about what you've done - own it, don't try to hide it, don't be cocky"

Someone once told me to look at what I'm telling myself at times like this (that I'm a waste of space, a disappointment to everyone), and then ask myself if that's how I'd speak to a close friend that's having some difficulty.

The long term goal here is to learn to make friends with yourself, and treat yourself with compassion and understanding, if that makes sense"

"I’ll say this, my son is autistic and adhd, methylphenidate made him EXTREMELY irritable, we gave it an honest shot for like a week and just gave up on it"
He became super noncompliant and would refuse to speak to us
My other son who is a bit lower support needs does absolutely fine with it
But it took several meds for him to find something that worked for him.
I am very irritated and nervous when I take ritalin
So because of this reason I am going to doctor tomorrow to get dexamphetamine.

Question do your symptoms feel better after eating these?
My cravings? No I have to stop myself so I don’t get diarrhea lol but it does give me a little burst of energy/happiness after eating it (kinda like opening a present or something lol) which is kinda weird I guess

Stimulants raise blood pressure
"I know dehydration can lower it, so I guess if you are dehydrated and it’s because of the medication then he’d have a point, but it sounds like for whatever reason they have an issue with this"
"Honestly if I hadn’t been through something similar myself I wouldn’t have said it was worth looking into a new doctor, but having experienced this I can’t say it will end up well.

Bottom line he is pressuring you to do something that is not best for your health and goes against all scientific medical consensus for treatment of adhd"
"I’ve had a doctor that seemed awesome growing up, except he didn’t believe hpv vaccines were worth it"
He convinced my mom not to let us get it and I resent him so much for that
He moved and we switched doctors and went to a really great one but she ended up being really weird with stimulants 🤦🏼‍♀️ it’s really hard but honestly I can’t trust a doctor that doesn’t follow medical consensus

Are you in the US or elsewhere? I got into testing in two weeks in the US.
That’s ridiculous
"My doctor gave me a list of neuro psychologists in my area and I just called one, made sure they took my insurance and could test me, and got in and diagnosed within two weeks"
Maybe call your insurance company and see who else you can get seen by?
Out of Ohio
They have me with Lifestance.
Def what I'm doing
Bullshit on that noise
" Call your doctor and insurance company and demand an ""in-network referral to an adult ADHD diagnostician."""
Ask your doctor for other options
"If they say go, see what your insurance says"
I did my testing online from home.

Be glad you can literally phone it in
 A lot of Americans have to have monthly appointments to get their refills.
This isn’t so bad.
Been on adderal 20mg xr x2 for 25 years medication checks every 6 months
I can’t phone it in
It’s just the text reminder to let me know the check is due
I can do my weight at home but they do my height and blood pressure.
Been on my meds (Dexedrine) same dose for 24 years
Have to check in every three months
It’s hell.
Why every 3 months not six months
I’ve been told it’s a legal thing
I’m in California and I get my meds from my primary care doctor.
Me too I get my adderal refilled by my doctor they are both stimulants I believe wonder what the difference is in California
I don’t know
When I was in NC (pre-2015) I only had to go to my doctor (neurologist) every six months
In California I started with a psychiatrist and had to go every 3 months - eventually they suggested my primary take over
That primary was part of UCLA system (as was the psychiatrist)
And I had to start going to her every 3 months in person
I thought this might be a UCLA health rule
"When I switched to a small private practice for primary care, I hoped it would go back to every 6 months"
But it’s every 3
She does let me do every other appointment virtually
"Again, I’ve been on the same meds/dosage for 24 years"
It’s SO HARD to stay on top of the logistics of just getting my prescriptions on time.

I try to stomach a meal or protein shake in the morning before I take my meds because I have the same issue! Protein shakes have been helpful for me and are less daunting than full on meals

"WHAT THE FUCK FUCK THAT GUY


It's also misogynistic since the implication is being a homemaker is just ""easy women's work"", like there's no deadlines, appointments, reports, & requests all the time! 


I hope you're able to find someone else & get help 🌸"
"sounds like you need a new psychiatrist, lmao"
"Tell your family doctor, insurance company, or whoever that you want an ""in-network referral to an adult ADHD and autism diagnostician."" You have a right to see one"
That's what I did and that's who diagnosed me.
"Ah yes, the standard “you’re too smart and normal to have ADHD” response"
🙄
Im literally in a depressive episode rm bc I feel like I’ll never succeed at any job bc of adhd and the first thing I see is this lmao
"I recently read an article that when women become mothers and they have to deal with child rearing and housework, they realize they have ADHD"
Looking after the house and kids requires executive Functioning.
What a giant bag of dicks that guy is
"Just saying, my working memory is bad, like 5th percentile bad"
I work in a high paced job with a professional designation
"I think the dynamic and fast paced environment actually helps me, I am never bored"
"Well, rarely"
"Early in my career had a supervisor come and talk to me after I expressed difficulty with executive functioning, she showed me how to use a calendar, organize my outlook, categorize emails and use the flag tool"
"It was embarassing actually, but very helpful.




 I'm still not perfect, but I am effective and have a positive impact"
"Whatever your limitations, there are ways to work around them, you just have to figure out what those things are and ask for support when you need it"
Don't let that dipshit put limits on you. 
Bruh
"As a housewife with ADHD, this shit is hard"
"I have a cleaner! I take laundry to the dry cleaners! Sometimes instead of putting something away, I'll just throw it in the trash to get it OUT of my way"
"If I can't find something I need, I'll just go buy a new one and have two if/when I find the original"
I have FIVE bottles of toilet bowl cleaner because I forgot to cancle a subscription for cleaning products after I HIRED A CLEANER!
"not only is a a sexist ass who should be reported to the board, he also completely underestimates and taks for granted the significant amount of skilled work and executive function it takes to be a ""house wife""."
My wife’s psychiatrist recommended she lower her stress and work as a barista
She’d just finished her second masters and had been recently promoted.
Get your vitamin and hormone levels checked too if your symptoms have worsened
Psych meds apparently need a certain stable amount of certain hormones to work
"

And find a psychiatrist/ neuropsychologist who does computer-based testing in addition to self-report and neuropsych testing"
I coughed up for private testing with a neuropsych group that does remote testing and did the computer-based and working memory testing
"Hours of it, fully caffeinated! First series of tests I’ve fully bombed since high school physics"
Apparently many psychiatrists haven’t had any/ a lot/ recent training in ADHD - so ask about their approach and what they know
Better to shop around and get someone good than waste time and energy on poor quick hits.
I was a SAHM
It's what broke me and finally made me get treatment for my adhd because it was so hard
"I am good at my job, and my symptoms are less when I'm at work"
"I got treatment and it helped drastically, to the point where I could function at home, but I also realized I will always at least be part time"
"

I'm sorry, OP"
Obviously I think it's time for a different opinion from a different provider
How many kids do you have? You need to focus to be a housewife too
Lol.
"Also like being a housewife is a a full time job, you just don’t get paid.

He’s way out there
Run"
This suggestion isn’t even FEASIBLE for a lot of women or households
"It’s making a LOT of assumptions, particularly that you have a partner whose income is high enough to support two people.

I also recently saw folks with adhd function more optimally when they’re relatively busy, and this fits my own experience…"
I've tried the housewife thing
"Kids were dirty, chores weren't done, house was a mess, I forgot to make appointments, forgot to keep appointments, dinner was basic, etc, etc"
"

Now, my goal is to make enough money that my boyfriend can stay home with the kids (which is actually what he'd prefer)"
"

Turns out that I actually do very well when employed full time and I'm making decent money in my chosen field."
"Hi, I’m a psychologist who does adhd evals (who also has ADHD) - if you’re in the US message me I’m happy to help you find someone more qualified than this dickhead"
I’m part of many many groups that I can reach out to for referrals for you.
"Wow, becoming a housewife? “Thanks” to my ADHD, household tasks are much harder for me than working as a teacher"
And teaching is already considered to be a hard job…
Um what? Being a housewife is not an ADHD friendly profession AT ALL
I had a doctor tell me that maybe college isn’t for me and I should consider factory work :-) I feel for you!
"This is horrible, I’m so sorry"
"Someone I know had to do that too- her old psychiatrist retired and her new one decided that her 20 years of an ADHD diagnosis was suddenly no longer valid, and made her get retested/redisgnosed to continue treatment"
"And of course they said the (pointless, expensive, and unnecessary) neuropsychological testing was inconclusive"
"Funny how tests that aren’t made to diagnose ADHD aren’t good at detecting and diagnosing ADHD!

In short, you’re not alone"
This is sadly a common experience
I’m sorry you had to face sexism and medical bias
Ditch this guy
Healthcare thats essential for you to function every day is being barred from you because of the whims of an ignorant person
It’s so fucked that this is a reality for many people.
I would be THE WORST housewife.
"You should do you, live life, fuck the psychiatrist, get another one"
sounds like medication could in fact be the answer
im....
very much as you described
my gp wouldnt give me a referal for ages because of the same reasons
lo and behold a decade in i talk to a neuologist who says there isnt even a doubt.
I know I may get downvoted for this but as a woman this is why I exclusively see female doctors
I cannot trust men in an already sexist industry
"Don’t get me wrong, there’s a lot of internalized sexism and I still struggle with finding doctors who take my concerns seriously (ahem gynecologists)"
 I guess men are comfortable being open about their misogyny now
What a setback huh? Makes me sick and afraid
"

I’m sure many comments have told you to follow a new psychiatrist"
I hope you can even report this one for his misconduct and misdiagnosing you (esp if you have proof).
"Reminds me when I was talking to my 1st and only psychiatrist last year, about being evaluated for ASD (my brother has it and probably my father too - mom has ADHD and I do too)"
"The psychiatrist was like ""you can't be autistic because you aren't gibbering in a corner rocking yourself in a psych ward"" but he did give me meds for insomnia but fuck that guy."
The executive load of running a household is insanely high
You’d be better off with a job.
"Ok but apart from all the gaslighting, ableism, and sexism....

As someone who has been a stay at home dad with untreated ADHD, just no...? Doing laundry, cooking, balancing accounts, all freaking impossible for me untreated."
Report that fucker to the board
This is horrendous.
Please report him/file any complaints necessary
People are only spared from providers like this if other people report their experiences
"Then, find a new psychiatrist."
Find a new doctor
Not all doctors are smart.
"Lmao the irony that so many of us women with ADHD struggle in the SAHM role because it’s lacking in any structure whatsoever.

That’s like my worst possible career outcome"
One-way ticket to depression.
"I know I'm preaching to the choir here but...being a housespouse isn't employment! No one hires or pays for housespouses!

>than to get treatment for disability

Or accommodations"
🙄 https://askjan.org/disabilities/Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity-Disorder-AD-HD.cfm
I'd imagine being a housewife would be as bad if not worse than working a day job with adhd. 
Are you in the United States? Try circle medical.
Yo
Sister
I felt this
"

I (38f) was a good little housewife, for a minute (14 years) and found myself disconnected and miserable"
"

I'm not going to say I have found any solace in my post divorce world, if anything it's been more chaotic and challenging and has damn near killed me"
"(Post history will testify)

But isn't it just fucking disgraceful"
It's horrible to be so vulnerable and offer yourself to people and hope to be heard and understood and validated and supported
And..
on your care team
You poor bugger
"

I'm beginning to wonder how much our ADHD impacts us, truly, as adults"
Because I fucking struggle with trusting myself and my feelings and thoughts
I have very little confidence or sense of worth - because we're all too much
Feel too much
Speak too much
Need too much
"And when you get to see a professional and word vomit your problems, you're apparently masking too much..."
"

The lack of confidence and ability to trust my judgement is currently fucking me over a lot"
"

Fuck this"
I'm fucking furious for you
And me
And all of us
We're battling along with a disability for christs sake
"Just because you can't see it as keenly as someone missing a leg, doesn't mean it's not bloody well there"

Fuckin hell"
God forbid we have ovaries and a disability.
Are you in the UK? If so the Equality Act 2010 applies here and you can definitely take this further as you have just had the pleasure of being discriminated against on the basis of gender
"

Was that  man btw?

Also if you are in the uk, I wouldn’t mind being PM the name of that psychiatrist so I can be sure to avoid them!

I find my memory is pretty good but dependent on things like sleep and much better with adhd meds"
"

For instance without adhd meds there is no bloody way I could participate in therapy like CBt and things like yoga and mindfulness are hell on earth unmedicated and I’d rather chew my own leg off than do yoga unmedicated"
"

I’m angry for you"
"I actually can’t believe I’m
Reading this"
"

I want you to complain and take it further"
Don’t let this incompetent sexist genderist tool get away with it.
I’ve never had burnout harder than when as a housewife with ADHD I jumped from one to two kids.
First of all fuck him to the highest degree
"Secondly, you’re an excellent writer"
I enjoy your writing style
I just want to validate your feelings here
I have been a skilled masker of my ADHD- inattentive type for my entire life
"Finally, one day I just broke"
My work was too intense and too important ( pediatric acute care ) to fuck up
I’d white knuckle it all day and end my shift in hives on my arms
Nobody should live like that or give up their life’s work.
Everyone please just be nice to me after this
I'm simply sharing my experience as an ADHD housewife
Being a housewife has been the best thing for my life
"I can't speak for the housewives who have kids because I don't have them (whole other conversation there), but since I quit my job, I've been drinking less, my house isn't cluttered, and I'm much more organized mentally"
"Yes, it's scary to think that I will be screwed financially by relying on someone else"
But I genuinely know that this is what I need to function
My life was a huge mess when I worked.
"That is not a psychiatrist, that is an incompetent who provided you with a prescriptive sexist stereotyped piece of bullshit instead of a medical opinion.

He shouldn't be allowed treat patients.

Find another psychiatrist"
"This is lowkey killing me lately :( We both have ADHD, but I'm better at keeping on top of house stuff and my partner is in a way higher earning career"
"If we have kids, the obvious thing to do would be for me to be a housewife, but.."
I really don't want to
"My financial independence, and connection to the world at large, is so, so precious to me"
I'm hoping we can somehow both work part time for the first few years of the kid's life and make that work financially if we decide we want to have one.
Ah just seen you said federal
I assume you’re US then
Not sure whether you have anything like equality act there
Sorry
😢
I’m a SAHM and when I can’t get my meds the entire household goes to shit
"I have to make my own structure, so of course it doesn’t work"
During Covid none of us did anything and it took me literally years after lockdown ended to climb out of that hole
"That guy doesn’t know what he’s talking about.

Rrrgh, I wanna give him a piece of my mind"
With force.
"It’s wild that this psych thinks being a housewife is less work or requires less planning/organizing skills, etc than a job out side the home"
My toddler is a harsher boss than any paid job I’ve ever had
They must not have children or be delusional.
No one tells you what to do with your life !
"I agree with others, definitely report him"
What an ass! He shouldn’t be counseling others with opinions like that.
jaw is on the floor
what the actual fuck. 
"I wish, so where is the one will pay for me?"
Fucking RUN
And also report him to the board.
I don’t what kind of handmaids tales crap this psychiatrist is on but I pray to God you file a formal complaint or something!!!! I can’t believe this!!! Holy eff!!!!!
"That’s wild, get another"
"The comment about holding attention in session is also wild because unless they can look into your brain how tf do they know what’s going on , do gp they expect you to upjumo up and down and climb the walls mid sessions? I remember a psych said same in a report and said I don’t think she has it she’s just depressed"
I didn’t argue it tbh but my GP said cos I had a diagnosis before it doesn’t matter it’s just his opinion and he’s not actually specialised in it
"The next time when I actually considered meds again from a diff place, they said the same thing"
"So just get a different opinion.

But the housewife comment is very wild and unprofessional sorry he said that to you"
❤️❤️❤️
"I'm not sure where you're located, but my primary care provider does my prescription"
"I believe primary care providers can also evaluate for ADHD, but that might need more research depending where you are"
"For adults, getting meds can be a lot simpler than for children and if you have been previously diagnosed four times, I imagine some might take you at your word if you just tell them your symptoms"
"

Also, that psychiatrist is an asshole and I would report him to your state's medical board"
That is an insane recommendation and completely inappropriate as well
The things you mentioned struggling with are a part of the reason people with ADHD need meds and acknowledging you probably can't remain employable while also saying that you don't have clinically significant symptoms is some really strange doublespeak.
What he said was unacceptable
But I'm curious if you could tell me about the various tests you took? I was diagnosed back in the day when it was basically a vibe check.
"I am a stay at home dad for the time being, and I love it.

But I wouldn't be able to do it without meds.

It ain't a vacation, and it ain't necessarily easy"
"It is easier in the sense that I have way more time to do the household stuff that needs to be done and is therefore less stressed about it.

What I am trying to say is: Fuck that guy, what an asshole."
"Where you live, must an ADHD diagnosis come from a psychiatrist? In California, you can get one from your regular doctor."
That psychiatrist can frak off
"

WTH?!?"
He’s terrible
That’s just remarkably bad.
I couldn’t be a housewife because I am over 50 and single
"Who would pay my rent? LOL
What a retro doc! 😂"
Never been married but in the brief period of time when I was collecting unemployment and chilling at home all the time OMG I went totally insane
It’s boring as all hell and boredom really isn’t good for ADHD brain
And the sheer monotony of thankless housework? No thank you
Domestic labor sucks
You couldn’t pay me to be a housewife
If I had the money and didn’t want to work I’d hire help.
WTAF is up with that doctor
Homemaker is probably the worst thing for a person with ADHD
"We need externally set routines, deadlines and expectations"
"The endless cycle of cooking and cleaning is literally the worst thing for a person with ADHD, we literally always complain about the chores we neglect that then become impossible and our difficulties with maintaining healthy eating habits"
"You will probably need to continue to pursue treatment with another psychiatrist, maybe you can find a good GP or psychologist to write a detailed referral so they are forced to take you seriously"
To try be a bit more 'employable' you may want to reach out to a psychologist who specialises in ADHD coaching or an OT
Good luck!
So glad to see the tradwife movement is having such a far reaching impact

"obvious misogyny aside, being a “housewife” is difficult as hell, and requires a lot of self regulation"
So screw that guy
"
Yeah we have to make do with what we have, but there are more than a few things we can do to help"
"
With meds, I’m actually on a stimulant and a non stimulant"
Strattera and Adderall XR
There are creative solutions to be had
"I use an app called dubbii that helps me to stay on track while doing stuff like getting ready, cleaning, etc"
as well as to start tasks that I’m having issues with starting in the first place
"It uses body doubling, or following someone else doing the same task as you"
"It has everything from waking up and getting a shower, to going through mail and cleaning big accumulated messes"
"
It’s about 30 bucks a year, but it’s not to a big corporation, so I’m personally happy to pay it"
"

My point is there is hope, and you have so much you can do with proper help."
I have been in a similar situation
"I am a man, so the did not tell me to be a houswife"
But  they told me something similar
"

It was humuliating and a punch in the gut"
 The therapist just made me feel worse and I felt betrayed
"

I am sending you a hug."
About a year after my first was born I was struggling bad with mental health and at the time untreated for my already diagnosed ADHD
"Living in a new city as well and not working outside the home.

I found a psychiatrist and explained my situation"
Her response was that ADHD is incredibly hard for stay at home moms
I found that so interesting and it made so much sense
I hope you can find a more supportive shrink who actually knows wtf is happening
I wish I could just be a house-husband with mine TBH
"Unfortunately I still probably wouldn't get anything done around the house until about 30 mins before he got home from work though lol.

Get a new psychiatrist"
It’s all fun and games until you forget to pay the bills and accidentally burn the house down
 What a jerk.
Fuck that fool
Holy shit! That's the most red flag doc of all time!  ADHD isn't a spectrum like that
" You aren't ""a little ADHD"" or ""a lot"", you just are"
" 

And accusing someone honestly seeking help of malingering is so toxic"
It sounds like this person doesn't have a clue what they are talking about
" 

Remember being a psychiatrist only means they went to med school, it doesn't indicate fuck all about what the specialized in or if they kept up with the current research"
" 

If you've been diagnosed that many times, odds are you have ADHD"
It presents differently in women and can co-exist with other disorders that make diagnosis tricky
"

If you are able, seek someone else ASAP."
You can (and should) report this guy
He’s being a sexist douche
"I had to report a psych who dismissed my previous ADHD diagnosis and said I can’t have autism “because [i] have a boyfriend.” 

Absolutely let the hospital know that you’ve already been diagnosed and this doctor’s dismissal of your abysmal mentor memory as just “something you have” and not a CLEAR SYMPTOM of the disorder you’ve already been diagnosed with is negligent, sexist, and bad medicine"
Sometimes you gotta swing that hammer down so these idiots learn.
"In addition to the bs psychiatry, sexism, and lack of interest in reality (the fact that you said in another comment that you have no kids and are single)....

I'm a house spouse (I'm nonbinary) specifically *because* my partner and I are both AuDHD, and if we both worked (which we did when we first moved in together), we'd eat take-out every night, constantly run out of clean socks, be unable to see our bedroom floor, and clean the bathroom maybe every six months"
"House work is *hard.* It is *time consuming* and *never ending.* We are incredibly lucky that my partner's trade union job pays enough that we can live on just their paycheck, so that I can make sure our needs are met and our home is enjoyable to live in"
"I can't imagine the additional struggles of ADHDers living on their own, having to work full time AND meet all of their physical and environmental needs.

You are so valid in your struggles, OP, and you've hung on this long"
"Hang in there a little longer, until you can find a specialist whose head isn't up their own ass and actually get the treatment and assistance you need."
"As someone who had to become a househusband for the exact reasons you're laying out here, I cannot stress how difficult THIS JOB IN PARTICULAR is for us with ADHD, particularly those of us who really struggle with remembering when things are supposed to be done.

Keep your job or stay in work, as chaotic as it may feel the overarching structure of work can help AND you get paid"
Dumb guy gave you awful advice I'm sorry about that.
To hell with that one
Go to a different psych
That one should NOt be in that roll
Also what N ass hole! You're amazing and can do anything you want!!!!
"You know, I’ve really come to loathe psychiatrists"
A licensed clinical social worker who specializes in adhd would be able to help you
I’m not gonna say what he said is valid but I would like to share my mum’s experience
"

She is the most professional house wife"
Idk any other word for it
We live in two different countries due to certain circumstances and she’s aware of both houses all the time
She has a list of everything the houses need all the time
She is constantly budgeting for both houses
She isn’t earning but she’s aware of our finances
She knows where everything is in both houses to the dot
It’s scary sometimes
Any maintenance that happens she remembers even tho she doesn’t have the receipts
She rmbrs the person who did it as well
"If I mention something needs fixing she will be like, “it was fixed two weeks ago"
Call that person again”
"

Ppl underestimate the amount of work that goes into being a house wife"
She tries to make savings too
She tells each house what groceries to buy
She’s absolutely awesome at it and has never faltered
"

What I’m trying to say is that; that dum psychiatrist thinks being a housewife isn’t taxing"
By God it is
ADHD needs maintenance too regardless of circumstances
"""1 federally convicted psychiatrist"" - i stopped reading right there and came straight to the comments"
wow!
What the hell does this psychiatrist think being a housewife involves? 🧐 house chores and appointments and whatnot are like…the hardest part of ADHD for me
"Fire that shrink.

My best unsolicited suggestions are to externalize every time commitment you can to either your phone's calendar (if you have a smartphone) or a planner you can keep with you"
"Set alarms for when you need to get ready for the next thing (pad your time estimates) and try to make a habit of stopping to update/check your calendar/planner, and maintaining lists of to-dos"
"More often than not, people appreciate when I pause the conversation to take notes.

Routines help a lot, as does having a designated place for everything in your residence to return to."
That sucks! What a jerk
"Ironically, many women finally get diagnosed when they're trying to run a household for they family because that's when the number of balls exceeds their ability to juggle them, and the lack of structure as a housewife / SAHM makes it *more* difficult to manage ADHD"
"He's an idiot.

I was able to get diagnosed fairly quickly by booking a telehealth appointment with a Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner (NP)"
"Most of those who do video appointments also do online booking, so it's easier to check availability as you're researching them"
"I found that first practitioner through ZocDoc.

SohoMD is another telehealth provider with psychiatric NPs in many US states"
"

If you're not in the US, I'm not sure if there are similar resources, but it could be worth looking."
My first attempt to get diagnosed at 26 with a psychiatrist said the same exact thing
"It put me off meeting with another psychiatrist for years, and I didn’t get diagnosed until 31"
"

Please seek a different psychiatrist sooner than I did!"
There are crappy psychiatrists just like there are people that suck in every profession
This is all too common a story and I feel both sad and pissed off every time I hear it
"Sounds like you are clear on challenges, have had success, and because of life circumstances are back to fighting just to get back to where you were in terms of support"
"My first reaction is F this guy, that kind of advice is very limiting and not helpful"
"My second thought is to try and empathize with his perspective, but if he is denying the challenges you are facing, that’s a big red flag to me"
"I’m fighting the urge to offer unsolicited advice so let me just say, you are not alone, and there are people out there that can help"
Don’t give up on the search
"If this person doesn’t believe and isn’t on your team, move on and find someone that can actually help."
God this makes me so mad!! I’m so sorry you had to go through this!! I had a similar awful experience when I was told that since my iq wasn’t below 100 I couldn’t possibly have ADHD
I can’t believe people like this are able to get their licenses
Just clueless assholes
I have noticed a lot of the same symptoms as you and have found executive function success with the following strategy
Put deadlines in a calendar and create a to-do list
"Every morning, have a 5 minute meeting with yourself about what needs to get done and what your responsible for that day"
This structure was pretty easy to manage once I got into the habit of it and does wonders for my executive function
"

One more thing is I set timers throughout the day when I dont want to forget something and when the timer goes off, even if I've forgotten why I've set it, I just check my to do list."
"I've had multiple psychiatrists investigated by the feds, and one got charged"
 Welcome to the club
" 

What he told you was not ok"
"However, keep in mind that the word is getting out about penalties for over prescribing stimulants"
I think some providers are taking an ultra conservative stance on ADHD diagnoses.
"Y’know, I skipped past through to the end and didn’t understand what was so bad about his advice as it’s a legitimate option as well as a suggestion not an order or anything"
"Then I saw everyone angry and decided to skim through the actual body text and realised, yeah time to change psychs."
[removed]
It’s so easy for me to be present during meetings with my psychiatrist and therapist because I enjoy learning
"My brain loves those things.

Yet when I watch most movies my mind can’t stay focused at all.

I hate that there’s so many stupid silly assumptions about what we can and can’t be good at in order to access the healthcare we need.

It’s a 1 hr meeting, if they could witness us for a full week in different settings it would be so obvious.

Why do people with ADHD have to prove their condition over and over and over again"
It makes me so upset and I’m sorry you went through this experience.
The amount of times I have been told to do that is insane
"I have been diagnosed with Adhd recently and believe me or not, I have been told to be a housewife"
It made me feel really bad
"But as a person diagnosed with Adhd, I have realised that being creative helps"
"At least for me, that has been helping"
"But the fact that to say someone to be a housewife, that’s ridiculous"
"

Keep doing what you feel is right."
That psych has never ever managed a house
What a self exposing misogynistic fuckwit.
"NEXT! 

Move on girl, time to find another one"
"I know it sucks but your health matters and a misogynist psych will not help you!

My old psych retired and I was set up with a new one"
"He was an older male, Indian descent"
"He told me ADHD was invented by teachers, it was not real and since I did well in school (barely) that I could not have ADHD"
Despite my Dad and brother both being diagnosed with it
"He also told me psychiatry is not a real science but an art of telling stories (I wtf’d at this)

He then told me that I have Cyclothymic Disorder —- which no, none of the symptoms match or line up with anything I was telling him"
"

At the end he did prescribe me my meds, which I had been on for over a year at this point with good success, but did it hesitantly and while chastising me"
"

Immediately changed doctors and I left a review"
"We don’t need to put up with outdated, harmful views from those we put trust in to help manage our health."
Let's take that person's license away 🫠 because wtf
That is so rude to makw assumptions about the things people with adhd symptoms can do...
That's RIDICULOUS
"I bet he would never tell a man to stay at home and just be a husband.

Don't give up on getting treatment!! I'm a girl and I also used to struggle a LOT with deadlines and stuff, which made me get really bad grades in my first year of university"
"I genuinely doubted my capacity, but ever since I started treatment, I've been maintaining a 4.0 GPA."
"reupload of comment sans recommendation of a website:

oh FUCK THAT"
"I had a joint ASD/ADHD eval and the psychologist told me that while my working memory was average (in the 60's percentile wise), it was a deficit in comparison to everything else (90's).

>My memory recall is at a severe deficit, which is, in his words, ""just a part of who you are that you have to learn to live with.""

my psychologist told me this as well BUT what she meant was that it is not something I can change, only something I can learn to accommodate"
"for example, I will never get better at remembering appointments"
"*however,* I *can* get better at consistently writing appointments down in a place I will see them"
"I will never get better at remembering multi step instructions but I *can* carry a small notebook and pen with me everywhere I go so that I can write the steps down as they're given and then reference those notes when I inevitably forget step 3.

some advice:
- write appointments and other important tasks down in one place"
don't put some in your phone calendar and some in a physical planner
"keep it all in one place, something that is easy to access and that you will always have on you

- if you end up using a phone calendar, utilize the alert function"
"if it's a recurring thing like a class, set an alarm to tell you when to start getting ready and when to leave

- if you struggle to get places on time, put them in your calendar as starting 15 minutes earlier than they do"
"trust me, it helps.

- work backwards"
figure out when you need to be there
then figure out how long it takes to get there
add 10 minutes for traffic/potential issues
"what do you need to do to get ready (eat, shower, change, etc)? estimate how long it will take you to do that"
THEN - this is critical - TIME YOURSELF DOING THOSE THINGS
a lot of us have a really hard time accurately estimating how long it takes us to do something
I used to budget 10 minutes for a shower until I timed myself for a week and realized it actually takes me 15 on average
"add like 20 minutes on top of everything else and then combine all of that to figure out when you need to set your wake up/get ready alarm

- is there anything you can do the night before to make things easier on yourself in the morning? (i.e"
"laying out clothes, setting out stuff for breakfast, etc.) if so, do that.

- KEEP YOUR PHONE, WALLET, AND KEYS IN THE SAME PLACE EVERY TIME"
"they don't necessarily need to stay together, though that does help"
for example I always plug my phone in at night and set it on my nightstand
"also on my nightstand is a box with my wallet, keys, and student ID"
I do my absolute best to never set them down anywhere else because I *will* lose them if I do that
"and then I will be late because I will spend half an hour looking for the keys I left in a coat pocket

- get"
accommodations
at work
"they don't even need to be formal, just saying ""hey I have a hard time remembering multistep instructions"
"can you [do whatever accommodation would help]"" can work great.

some accommodation options for multi step instructions:
- get step 1"
"once step 1 is completed, report back to the Provider of Steps (PoS) and get step 2.
- PoS gives you a written list of steps
- PoS verbally gives you all the steps BUT lets you write down each step before moving on to the next"
"it may be on you to say ""hold on, let me finish writing this one down before you give me the next one."" personally, this is what I opt for most of the time

best of luck! sorry you got such a shitty psychologist :/"
"Get another psychiatrist, this one stinks!! I had a similar awful situation when I tried to get an adhd diagnosis"
"This horrible person straight-up said to me, “well you just stay at home with your kids, so it doesn’t matter, does it?” I barely held it together til I got to my car, then I bawled my eyes out"
"

Thank god I tried another therapist down the list, who was actually good and got me good meds"
"And sought out and found an adhd coach, who helped me plan an exit strategy out of my tough life situation, leading eventually to a career that was high-profile and successful"
"Could never have done that without help.

AND “being a housewife” and a SAHM is very very hard with ADHD"
"Glad I could be with my kids while they were young, but so tough with our wiring"
That guy is a jerk and a hack doc.
Yeah that’s not…correct
I have diagnosed ADHD (and everyone I’ve ever met could attest to it likely being accurate lmao) and I paid very close attention to the psychiatrist during my session
"It’s a disorder of inconsistent attention - and quite famously includes hyper-focus during which you can pay *so* much attention to someone/something that you may be able to do so for hours on end, forget to eat/drink and potentially even forget to use the bathroom"
"

It’s also quite mixed messaging from him….hes confirming that he believes you have deficits/symptoms that fit but is refusing to legitimise them with a diagnosis"
That is so frustrating especially as I assume you have paid through the nose to be condescended to and invalidated this way!
You should ask him if he's gonna give you loads of money to be a stay at home mom 😂🤣
"Umm, yeah.."
About that
"Report the misogynist.

I have similar issues, not diagnosed with full-on ADHD (my diagnoses at different points in time were Anxiety with SYMPTOMS OF ADHD, BPD,  Non-standard development - whatever the fuck that means - and depression, I think)"
"What I believe I have is basically a complex mess of CPTSD (because it's an objective fact I have been abused most of my life and have trauma from that), ADHD (because I have pretty big issues with memory, boredom, executive function.."
Need I go on more?) and potentially ASD (but I am very shaky on this one
"The only issues I have that could be attributed to it could be how I pretty frequently miss the intention of people's behaviours, ""jokes"" etc, and have a very black and white thinking in some specific topics"
"I also have a history of getting into something and then dropping it like a hot potato after a while)...

Does not help that I appear functional even though I pretty much have severe issues with it"
And the only place specialising in ADHD where I am was where I have the Anxiety with Symptoms of ADHD diagnosis from
Also from a male neuropsychologist
"I feel like that might have played a role.

EDIT: DAE have facial recognition issues? The guy also told me I have that and I KNEW something was off about it all my life and I was never listened to!"
Did he do any computerized tests? Did he have anyone else fill out symptom reports about you? It is true that most psych tests are designed to detect exaggeration and inconsistent answers and do with a decent level of accuracy- but what is also true is that it doesn’t necessarily mean you are lying or intentionally exaggerating - it shows up when people are afraid they will not be believed
"Hi, as a woman, of course we don’t think we’re gonna be believed. 

Iirc, and it’s been a while since that class, but also just being previously diagnosed with a disorder can trigger this because patients know what their disorder is and agreeable patients answer to how they feel they’re supposed to answer."
Lmao the only way I'm functioning as a stay at home mom is because I finally got diagnosed and started a low dose adderall script
And really all that does is make it so I don't have a shutdown when the dogs licking themselves on top of the children screaming and the tag in my shirt itching
"I still misplace things and forget I left the milk out and I go through phases like making a sensory bin for every holiday, then not touching sensory bins for 6 months.

Screw this guy"
"Get a new psych and if people ask why, tell them you were concerned about misogynistic suggestions"
ADHD is a bit anti-diagnosive as we forget to say/remember the reasons why we think we have it
"And there are also quite many of us who are good in 'test' environments, but completely different in an equivalent situation out in the world"
"And also stuff like, during the test I am able to chant the number in my head to remember, however in a real situation I would not be able to do so."
I’d honestly report that type of weird sexist comment to the board and find a new psych.
"Get a new psychiatrist, this one sounds like a federal lawsuit waiting to happen.."
Good luck!
"I personally think that being a housewife is an amazing occupation and should be taken very seriously when making such a decision.

And that psychiatrist is a big a-hole.

I suggest try to get a neuropsychological assessment if you can"
"Or, at least, find a different psychiatrist… I’d try getting on Wellbutrin to see if it helps — it’s used off label to treat ADHD — not very good in terms of data, but at least a GP can prescribe it no problem.

Also maybe try getting some cognitive tools"
"A good starting point is to look into building up executive functioning skills, like maybe the book “smart but scattered”"
I was diagnosed after getting all of my degrees and having been steadily on a career path that I chose 10 years ago
"Before my diagnosis, my executive functioning skills have saved me from drifting away"
"It’s not easy, but possible.

Good luck!"
That shrink was extremely sexist
Report him and find another
"Also, domestic duties take A LOT of focus"
"I've exploded at least a dozen eggs this year alone and that's just from attempting to feed myself, not because I'm a housewife."
"FUCK THAT GUY 
My PCP diagnosed me and that's how I get my meds"
I also paid an out of network place to evaluate me so I know what specific kind of ADHD I have
I'll send you a link to those people
They rock!
Sorry to hear your soon to be ex psychiatrist is a quack
File a complaint on this ass hat
He’s horrible at his job
"Get him canned, if that’s possible."
Why tf does he think being a sahm/housewife would be easy?? That's exactly what I am and I've struggled with it for years
"I'm hopeless at it! Mind you, not medicated though...."
Report him
THAT IS OUTRAGEOUS! I’d be reporting that doctor.
I wish I could be a housewife
And to think this person paid a ton for a degree and this is the garbage advice he thinks is professional 😵‍💫
What total BS
"I was working full-time and doing all of the housewife jobs, and it drove me to a point where my psychiatrist put me out on a FMLA form my work"
I miss my work
The housewife's work never ends
"As my grandmother always said, a woman's work is never done"
You need to get to see somebody else.
What a joke
Please don't go back to this guy
He's obviously misinformed and ignorant about the condition
I guarantee those tests are not designed for the different ways that women present with ADHD
"

I had a similar situation, I have ADHD, BP, BPD, and PTSD"
"Despite this, I received a BS and two master’s degrees and worked at several six-figure jobs"
My psychiatrist has said more than once that if I work hard and stick with meds then I can “have a decent life”
I will have an incredible and fucking magical life thank you very much
I abhor when people impose limits on you due to a diagnosis
"They have no idea how much creativity and innovation can come from unique thinking, which we have in abundance"
"

Find someone knowledgable in treating ADHD in women"
"If this is impacting your life negatively and preventing you from reaching your personal goals, then its enough to require intervention of some kind"
Its been shown in studies that meds are really the only way to treat ADHD
"

Saying you're exaggerating your symptoms is rude, unprofessional, and disrespectful"
Its also basically gaslighting (You: I feel this way; Doctor: No you don't) Your doctor should believe what you tell them and trust you
"If they don't, then they will never allow you to be an equal partner in determining your course of treatment, which you should be"
You’ve been diagnosed before
You can find someone that will believe you on that and move forward with discussing how to start tackling your symptoms
"

Best"
"Wow, that psychiatrist is a misogynistic AH.

Are you able to get a second opinion? If so, get one and then file a complaint to his licensing body for sexist behaviour.

Until I got diagnosed and medicated, my house was chaotic"
I couldn't organize or keep on top of anything
Executive dysfunction prevented me from doing simple things like emptying the dishwasher
"

Work was the easier part for me, due to deadlines and the consequence of failure (military)"
I thrived under the pressure of my job
"When I retired, things fell apart."
"Yuck, can you report him? That's horrific"
I'd also try to see another person who has more experience diagnosing women and even late diagnosed adults (probably more attuned to the ACTUAL diagnosis).
Wow time to find a better doctor!!!
"Brooooo wtf who is this psychopath psychiatrist……


I’m a prison guard and I have ADHD"
We have a million deadlines
I go to therapy and take meds
Trust me your life is so much more worthy!
I agree with all the wonderful supportive comments and would like to add that I read this as “Housewife” as in “Real Housewives of XYZ” and was like damn the psych finds you so entertaining they think you should be on Bravo?!
I'm sorry you went through this
The way I'd want to kick his brains out.
He's a DOUCHE and he needs to lose his license and more
"Honestly I don't trust any of them, I've never gotten adhd meds prescribed after visiting 3-4 different psychiatrists because they ALWAYS gaslight me that it's actually anxiety and depression and not adhd and try to drug me up with ssris"
As a stay at home parent/house wife I can assure you it’s a shit ton of work which absolutely requires me to take my meds
Jeezus Christ that is a terrible doctor.
Literally if it’s interfering with your ability to function in daily life it’s a disorder
Your ability to mask doesn’t change what is going on on the inside
 Boot him.
A second opinion
Yesterday! And fuck that guy
I'd bet my balls he's been divorced more than once.
Lol I honestly have nothing to say here that isn't gonna be mean about that doctor
"Get a new one, dudes a fucking hack and shouldn't have a license."
"How bizarre, it’s not a psychiatrists job to make recommendations like that"
In fact the only thing he should be recommending is strategies to help overcome mental health related obstacles.
"Hiiii, I have really bad adhd & I got my ass into law school"
"
Still a lot of adhd shit happening day to day, I look like I’m here but I am not sometimes 🤠 & I will still find my keys in weird places."
I actually just forgot I lost my whole wallet Friday by accident
"But I prepare for moments knowing myself, I made sure to carry a wallet idc ab in case it did get lost bc that’s my life LOL"
Also when things happen I just mentally have gotten to the point of finding comfort in just not being upset over anything
I just laugh & move on
But I do try my best to implement things that can be of huge help (if it works that week) but I always acknowledge that I have adhd & try to be gentle to myself
"Kind of like acceptance ? LOL but fear not, impulsivity."
and drive(on adhd) gets you to places despite feeling like u are at a disadvantage.
u are not
Oddly enough I was put in acting bc of my “high energy” & excelled in that in nyc as a child actor ti I got bored & went on to the next thing & next thing.
& so forth.
"psychology, social work, 3.9 gpa undergrad (no accommodations 😰 was not diagnosed yet) & now I’m here ! I’m in law school lmaoooo kind of just said eff it took the lsat (well I studied bc it made me wanna achieve 🤪) & yeah."
I’m dying rn in law school but even now I’m being chill w myself in moments Ik life is not perf.
won’t beat myself up for things
It is what it is LOL
BUT just wanted to dropppp all this info to show u can do anything
"Literally, im questioning how I got here."
on this Reddit post🤔 I have to go to readings
Yeah..
because with ADHD cleaning and cooking come as a breeze.
Wow
Just wow
What a condescending asshole.
Some 'professionals' are really monstrous
Yeah I'd report him.
You should report that to the board department! That is unacceptable! 😔
I would strongly consider making a complaint to the whatever regulatory agency manages this guy’s medical license (state board of psychiatry in the US) for discriminatory behavior
Unacceptable.
Girl
Find a new psychiatrist
I have literally all of these problems and am in medical school
He can go fuck off.
Fuck that guy
Run
I went undiagnosed until I was 41 and I served in the military
Somehow I managed to not kill myself or other people and I have the same issues hhahahahhahhha
When I got out the Navy my PTSD and Adhd made it difficult to stay employable
"At one point I was more unemployed than employed, and was almost homeless a few times"
I pretty much accepted I'll never get or mantain a managerial job
"I had the same issues as you, missing deadlines, forgetting reports"
I found that working from home was best for me
Technically that qualifies as a SAHW\M but still employed
"He may have been sexist with his suggestion, but I think he was saying you would have issues like I did and to save the headache and stress by getting married and having the husband work while you chill at home and enjoy life"
I'm never working in a office again
"It was torture, people bullied, sabotaged cause they knew something was off with me but didn't help, and there was no mentorship or second chances, just cold hearted assholes left and right, and I work in IT"
Lord knows how it is in other professions.
Should
Should I ask about that federally convicted psychiatrist or
Psychiatrist is a fucking asshole and should be reported
"

Can you contact the clinic where you got the diagnosis? Even if that’s the psy that got convicted, they might still have something? If not, the psychiatrists professional order might have something or at least advice? Is that guy in prison?"
Just a general PSA: any mental health professional who gives any kind of value-based advice or judgements without some extenuating circumstance is extremely unprofessional
"This guy sucks, clearly"
"If you're in the US, consider finding a primary care physician who specializes in ADHD treatment"
I currently have my PCP manage my treatment and medication
"
It's easier, cheaper and faster than a psychiatrist."
"Aside from the misogynism, just another doctor on a mission to declare ADHD as something that doesn't exist or is illusional"
"Get another doctor  I know it’s a pain -
It’s why I haven’t done back to a doctor - the staring over - proofing yourself again - but this guys a jerk

Report him to the board and get a better doc"
How old is this guy? I’m pretty sure the older the doctor is the less likely they are to understand this disorder.
Wow! I’m so sorry
"As a mental health therapist, reading this is infuriating"
I’m sorry he was so dismissive and invalidating
May I ask where (generally) you are located (e.g
"rural Indiana, Nashville suburbs, Idaho, etc"
- only if and what you are comfortable sharing)? The push back against helping people with ADHD can be extreme
Reporting this provider to the state licensing board is within reason
His recommendations were misogynistic and highly demeaning
It is absolutely beyond reasonable to feel angry about this experience.
Doctor is making a misogynistic recommendation
Would they recommend to me I should be a house dad or a stay at home dad? I think not.
Don’t listen to him housewife is the worst occupation for ADHD 😭 I work best in a team environment doing something I can get excited about (I used to be a cook in a camp kitchen)
Housewife at least for me I’m alone a lot doing things I’m not good at by myself and there’s no one to motivate me or appreciate my work the way a good supervisor or teammate would
I could probably be a good not attractive trophy wife but that’s about it
"

That being said I hate that you’ve had to go through those things"
You deserve better
"Oh he needs to be reported to the licensing board, he should not be practicing psychiatry."
Can you report this ? This seem wildly irresponsible…
I feel like you found this psychologist in an episode of Mad Men.
Wait I’m confused
"I get that you were first diagnosed with adhd by a now unreliable psychiatrist, but how have you been diagnosed 3 more times? Or have you seen a psychiatrist 3 more times and not been diagnosed the last time? 
Does it say you have adhd according to a psychiatrist now or no? Do you live in the US? Just stuff for getting aid"
"As a housewife I can assure you my adhd fucks that up, too. "
Report tf out of him omfg I’m so sorry you had to deal with that omfggggggg that’s ridiculous
Actually report him tho if he can just freely say that  to you then he is probably just Willy nilly discriminating and being all misogynistic to other people in the same situation and all these people aren’t getting serious treatment for their medical needs
That is just so blunt that I feel like he does that often
"

I’m sorry dude wtf"
Leave immediately
Document everything he’s given you
Complain to your state’s medical board and his supervisors
"

I’m so sorry you experienced this"
It’s just hypocritical.
Yeah this pisses me off
"My adhd isn’t just forgetting things or spacing it but it’s huge emotional disregulation, it’s losing my shit to the smallest things, it’s overthinking every conversation with people and then convincing myself I sounded stupid and they hate me"
It’s not being able to clean my house or even leave my bed some days because the task paralysis is so overwhelming
It’s mental exhaustion to the point it appears like depression but really it’s just all adhd
So how someone can say just be a house wife is beyond me when adhd is so much more than just zoning out.
That shrink is an idiot!  (I work in the medical field and have held several key positions in the business world)  This response is almost reportable to the state board
 It’s demeaning and obviously not helpful
" There are many other responses they could have chosen, even referring you to someone else or suggesting you get help like someone to come in and clean once or twice a month"
 They are educated enough to have suggested some of what I’ve written below
" And if there was a personality conflict, they could have made an excuse and gracefully referred you to a new therapist/medical professional/social worker"
" 
Maybe they had jock itch that day (if it were a man) or allowed their personal problems to affect their professional judgement"
" Do not go back-seek help elsewhere.

Use calendars, planners and your cell phone alarm"
 You can also write important dates in on your cell phone calendar and receive reminder notifications
" If your cell phone doesn’t currently have voice recording, download an App"
 Make a recording for every day
 You can re-record the list when you need to update it and repeating your To Do List would be good exercise for your brain (use it or lose it)
" If you’re going shopping, text yourself a list so you make sure you get everything"
 You can also do the same for errands (Example: You don’t want to get home and realize you forgot to stop at the post office)
" You can even send an email to your personal or work account as a reminder (For those, I have to do XYZ tomorrow at bedtime moments).

Also, invest in some cheap Dollar Store white boards"
" Put one of the back of a kitchen cabinet door, the bathroom cabinet/closet door, etc"
" (Even a garage or utility room)  This is a good method of remembering when you need to renew a Rx, call for a follow-up appointment, service your car, buying something you’re going to run out of, remember how to do something (Example: turn off water in an emergency) call for annual service, etc"
 The boards are cheap And come with an erasable marker
" You can put boards that contain private information in places visitors won’t see, and otherwise they will think you’re cool for keeping lists"
":)

The Dollar Store has great big block calendars, particularly in the fall for the upcoming year"
 Have a calendar specifically for each family member
 You can write in other important dates like birthdays for family and friends
 They also have small pocket book sized calendars the size of a checkbook cover
" You can go Old School and simply track everything manually, just keep a pen clipped to the calendar (use a hair elastic or thick rubber band if need be, so the pen doesn’t end up in the bottom of your purse, because then you won’t use the calendar or you’ll get frustrated always searching for your pen!).

I try very hard to get my other half to put appointment cards on a bulletin board I keep on the back of the door going down to the basement"
" Great place to hold tickets so you don’t lose them (I have!), coupons, a calendar, business cards, family stuff, and even important bills to pay (like real estate taxes due Xx/xx/xx ) which you should have written in on a calendar or on your phone with a reminder alarm.

I will admit that I don’t always practice what I’m preaching but when I need to remember or be reminded of important things, I definitely use some of the above tactics to help me out and this makes life less stressful.

You‘re perpetuating your ‘problem’ by not taking control of it"
" We all do it at times, and it breaks down our worth and self esteem"
" Also, during stressful times we might be more forgetful"
 Give yourself a break and stop beating yourself up
" Just like someone who needs to lose weight, quit smoking, etc.-it’s a process"
" Sometimes you screw up, but there is no doubt that when you get your mojo with this organizing info, your life, career and general well being will benefit"
" Also, if someone else (adult) is part of making you think you’re going crazy, set them up with some of these (free or cheap) organization systems and force them to be responsible for their own life!  You’re not everyone‘s personal secretary!  It may take some prompting (like asking them if they wrote their next appointment on the calendar, etc.) but after a few times of prompting/nagging them, they should be on board"
" This will take a lot of weight off your shoulders.

Good luck and again, Stop Talking/Thinking Like You’re The Village Idiot!"
I’m a registered nurse with ADHD
"My advice to everyone is to find another country you relatively like and get out of the United States (I know OP may not be in the US.) 
It’s not just the US, but here especially, this treatment is becoming the norm"
Providers with even 4 stars rarely exist
"

I empathize - but I also want to offer realistic information… keep fighting for the care you deserve"
Just be careful with how high you let your expectations get bc it’s only getting worse ❤️‍🩹
I'm so sorry
That's really shitty
"I suggest finding a new doctor, filing a formal complaint about the bad one or having a lawyer send him a letter for discrimination"
It sounds to me like you're being discounted and not taken seriously because you're a woman
I don't throw discrimination around lightly
His advice was very out of bounds and insensitive. 
"A house wife isn’t easier, I do basically 100% of cooking, cleaning, and pet care around my full time job and I find my job easier in that sense"
"Plenty of times I walk around my house saying “oh wait what was I doing? Where did I put ____? Oh no I burned the toast I forgot I even had it in the toaster” not to mention the same procrastination around cleaning etc if it gets too out of hand or if overwhelmed. 

Now imagine that with kids"
"But hoping on calls? Getting alerted back into reality when I have one coming in or a boss reach out? Knowing all my tabs I should check so quickly being able to if I worry I forgot or missed something? Easy.

I know this is old, but I hope this gives good things to consider if others like me find it and actually think like that guy, being a SATW/G for many don’t always pan well.

You should report him honestly, that’s a very unhealthy attitude and mindset to have as a counselor/therapist etc."
"OK, I don’t have time to read all the comments so apologies if other people already said this, but 1) eff this sexist a**hole and 2) please forget him and go do actual testing with a psychologist"
I underwent a full evaluation to see if I had ADHD and needed meds
There are actual tests psychologists administer and evaluate to determine whether you have ADHD
They basically evaluate your different psychological functioning
My test took 6 hours
"The results were sobering: my executive function is, in fact, where I am lacking"
I didn’t know until after the testing when I read more about it (I purposely waited to read about the testing) which test was measuring which function
"I remember which tests were harder for me, and, in fact, those are the ones where I scored lower"
"Insurance sometimes covers these tests, sometimes not"
"They are expensive, but they’re as objective as you can get, I think (I’m not an expert, but they’re definitely tests and not just questionnaires, with a professional administering them, and a second psychologist goes through the results and evaluates you and writes up the report)"
"Even if it is expensive for you, I would consider saving up to do it because then you will have a solid report you can rely on moving forward"
"I am so sorry you had to deal with such poor treatment, and your experience also makes my blood boil"
"It is high time so-called professionals (and everyone else, for that matter) stop punishing us for having a different brain structure and instead empower us to use our gifts"
Grrrr
"Don’r let these b*stards get you down!!

Editing to add: I did have to wait months to get in to do this testing, which was frustrating, but it was so worth it."
"I wish that being a housewife was an option for me as a man!


That guy is an ass though, get a second opinion for sure"
"As a stay at home parent, he's right"
"But not for the reasons he thinks! It ain't because it's less taxing than other jobs, that's for certain"
But I have found the high degree of novelty and requirement to react creatively to everything a day throws at you to be really suited to my ADHD brain
I also thrive on autonomy and have a certain fuck-you stance on authority that I have found to be associated with my ADHD
Being a housewife and stay at home parent really lock in with those ideas
"I'm raising a pair of weird, non-masking, intelligent and thriving little kids with mixes of ASD and ADHD and it feels nice. 


Maybe they might grow up to be psychiatrists who actually understand what it means to have brains like ours! That might be nice"
I consider my occupation to be a worthy one. 
The ADHD subreddit is extremely toxic
"The only opinion you are allowed to have about your own ADHD in that subreddit is that it’s the worst thing that’s ever happened to you, and that medication is a necessary and almost always excellent choice, and that any kind of non-medical coping strategy is just “neurotypical advice” even if it has been empirically demonstrated to be helpful for ADHD"
A lot of “i tried it once and it didn’t work therefore that doesn’t work for ADHD”
"Same vibes as “I exercised once and didn’t lose weight therefore exercise is pointless for me”.

Obviously this is an overgeneralisation, but I find the folks there to be incredibly reactive and intolerant to the slightest suggestion that ADHD can come with strengths as well as weaknesses (even when framed as only my own PERSONAL experience and not a generalisation) or that things like meditation, regular exercise, and using a planner can actually be hugely beneficial if you can successfully form the habit"
Forming habits is fucking hard with ADHD but not impossible
There is a real sense of learned helplessness there which leads to extreme defensiveness against anything that doesn’t align with their worldview.
Wait
Why is ADHD a disability?
There's nothing wrong or offensive about homemaking; I think that's very considerate of him to suggest \*considering\* a job that can match your current level of functioning
Ignore it and move on
"Take a breath, stop clutching your pearls and grasping for something to get offended by, and find a psychiatrist who you're on the same page with"
"Telehealth is easy and convenient, and this subreddit isn't a diary."
Man these psychiatrists that get posted about here really give it their all to trigger our collective justice sensitivity
Being a housewife should depend on several  things
"Is that what your husband and children want? Does your husband make enough to money to support you all? Do you have a good paying, rewarding job that you love? It didn’t sound like it"
"Also, do you enjoy being at home with your family? I’m sorry to tell you this but taking amphetamines and working full time may make you feel good for a while, but you will likely regret that decision in the future"
Personally I’ve found that doing hard things and spending time with my family makes me feel way better than adderall ever did
"Sorry if I sound cheesy, but I think you should seriously consider the downside to taking drugs to enjoy your life and start a career"
Especially if you have a family that needs you
"Your time, love, and attention cannot be replaced by extra income."
ADHD isn’t a disability.
[removed]
This is an awful lot to write for someone with ADHD and no medication...
just saying....
THIS!!!! So much bullshit wrapped up in one comment
I am barely employed BECAUSE the work of daily living and maintaining my home take all my time and energy! It is WORK!! God I wanna find this guy and just strangle him Bart Simpson style
"Housewife/SAHM is definitely more taxing for me than any job was.

At the very least you're managing two people's lives (you and partner)"
"You're primary contact for everything - doctor, dentist, contractors, specialist, pharmacy, etc"
You need to self start (using those pesky executive function skills)
You have to clean and tidy the entire living space (+/- any partner caves that you swear off)
You have to cook which means you have to grocery shop
You have to remember what IS in the fridge so you don't buy that for your cooking
"You need to make sure social obligations are scheduled and not double booked - even if your partner is in charge of making their own social events.

Throw in anything unexpected like...the house floods...the zombie apocalypse starts...the tornado blows your roof off and then you have shift everything else to prioritize that task and associated tasks.

Throw in kids...the work just doubled"
"Throw in sick children and it's even worse (because nobody likes being sick and nobody likes sick kids).

OP, go book that appointment for the middle of next year"
Try to get some help from this foolish doctor (even if it's playing him and playing to his assumptions)
"Hopefully anything you get from this guy will be a Band-Aid until you can get some real help.

Inclusive Edit: Of course it doesn't matter who stays home, mom or dad or person."
Genuinely can't think of much that's less ADHD friendly than having to look after a house and household
That psychiatrist is a misogynistic arsehole.
Being a housewife is an impossible task
"I fail daily, cry at the mess and have breakdowns"
It’s no picnic!! I’d love to be able to concentrate long enough to get a job and pay someone to do it for me but my squirrel brain refuses to cooperate
"Second this, time for a new doctor."
I excelled at school/college and was an effective employee
Then I stayed home with my kids
My world began to unravel
I wasnt diagnosed until after my youngest kid was dx in kindergarten
"Meaning, I struggled for 5 years without support, empathy or hope"
"The lack of structure, the constant interruptions and noise, the constant emotional drain and  the too much to do interspersed with downtime sent me spiraling"
SAM parenting is really hard for ADHD parents.
"This! Housewives had so much to do, like it’s not an easy job whatsoever"
"If anything, it’s an awful job for someone with untreated mental health issues"
Hard agree
Being a housewife with executive dysfunction issues is hellish
"It feeds directly into some of the root issues with executive dysfunction, mainly that there are so many jobs that do not have a defined end, nor is there any accountability before it’s too late to fix it"
"Around the house, I never feel like I’ve gotten anything done, nor is there usually anyone else around me to help me remember what I’ve forgotten before I’ve fucked up someone I love’s day entirely"
"I have made plans with my husband in the past for me to go to the store to get ingredients to cook a dinner, and then forgotten to go to the store, leaving us with no other dinner plans"
I have forgotten play dates and medical appointments for my kids
And I HATE knowing that my issues made my kids late for something.
"I work a fairly demanding office job in a field I love, which gets regular stress peaks"
"I get overwhelmed, I ignore e-mails and calls, and some days I just can't get anything done"
"

I am still 10x more productive than I could ever be as a housewife"
"I've never been able to keep my space tidy, organised or clean"
"If anyone would tell me I should just be a housewife I'd laugh in their face, then report them for a severe lack of professionalism."
"I’m a mom of 2 and a teacher, and my summers/breaks are just as much work as the school year lol"
Such a good point
"I'd rather work a ""real"" job than be a housewife any day if we are talking levels of difficulty."
I think they saying that they should be allowed treatment not have to go be a housewife (extremely hard work) to survive.
"agreed! 
Report that fhcker."
I would make a terrible housewife.
"Disagree: I (M, 46) came to a similar conclusion after a 12 ur career in my chosen field"
"Toward year 11, I began to see deficiencies and impairments in my thought processes versus that of my colleagues which during my last year, continued to clarify and project themselves to a point where coping was no longer a sufficient technique"
I began reading about ADHD here on reddit and almost immediately understood the nature and depth of impairment this disability represents
And the multi-lateral challenges of making and keeping a well-appointed home actually fits my strengths fairly well while its informality forgives in the areas that the executive suite in my career never would accommodate
"Homemaker (Chief Domicile Officer, if you prefer)  has a bad rap still, as the default activity of the fairer sex and all the baggage that comes with the phrase"
"Its still needs to be done, and still requires a great deal of time, effort and skill to execute well."
"Just imagining having to manage household funds, bills, logistics, and every cleaning task and cooking task alone makes me want to cry."
Seriously! I am a SAHM and the challenges of taking care of my family are what finally pushed me to get diagnosed and medicated in my 30s
This is not the easy route
Asshat.
It's harder to get fired in that occupation.
"Isn't it misogynistic on our part if we take offense to it?

I get it, I'm a woman too (maybe a naive one) but I didn't immediately think it was a comment to insult"
"Being a homemaker is HARD work but one where you have more flexibility in terms of meeting ""deadlines"" and expectations.."
"He only had 1 star reviews, but the earliest appointment with any in-network specialist was 7 months out, so I went with it"
I was prepared to accept the results & seek help for my memory when he told me to be a housewife and I realized with certainty that he's just incompetent
And bitch this one out too
The hell is wrong with that Doc
Mine is purely professional and would never suggest something so stupid.
"I did 🥲 he was the first available, at 7 months out"
It's rough out here
"Eye contact & nodding with the occasional ""uh huh"" is 2nd nature to me"
I'm not TRYING to not pay attention
"It takes a tremendous amount of effort to rein my thoughts back to the topic at hand.

Maybe if he had South Park playing during the session, he would have seen how easily I get distracted?"
Now with added misogyny!
"Take it as a sign not that you'll never be successful, but that you have to disregard people who are unhelpful and give bad advice"
This guy makes a living despite solely having 1-star reviews on every platform
"Certainly, you can make a cushy living, too"
"It kinda sucks, but a lot of us excel in things like police, EMT, corrections. "
"I'm in a similar boat, but I can at least offer this"
One of my closest friends has pretty severe ADHD and is running a successful business that I work for
He managed to get his habits in order to work with his insane work ethic
I really look up to him for this reason
We can do it too
We just need to focus on learning to live with the ADHD rather than blame it
We got this!
If this is any consolation..
"In my last IT-internship both the project manager (she was good at her job but also overall lovely person, great people skills) and the managing director (he was also a very professional guy) had ADHD. "
Oh hey it’s me! Stressful job on top of it but I likely wouldn’t have gotten a diagnosis if I didn’t have a kid
All my coping mechanisms got thrown out the window with the extra responsibility and no time to myself
I can't imagine the chance of the kids also having ADHD will help with that either.
Does it take more executive function to have a full-time job AND complete one’s household duties? Or just to focus on one?
Jesus that's so fucking infuriating
As if being a batista wouldn't ALSO be stressful
Seems like someone led a privileged life
(Obviously not referring to your wife)
Thanks for some really good advice!!
"Not only do I not have kids, I'm also single"
"Right? Like it is still a full time job of running a household, raising children"
Join the army
"Does this always happen, that when a psychiatrist retires and you get a new one they will require you to get rediagnosed? This makes me worried for myself"
"😂 same

I'm on evening shift this week, which starts at 330, and I'm always rushing to shower at 230 wtaf"
Yes! I agree
Circle Medical got me taken care of
My work/ life performance has improved dramatically!
"Fair, but OP doesn't have a spouse, so.."
I find this interesting too
"I read a lot of stories about people having a hard time getting tested or the tests being inconclusive, etc.

I printed out the self report assessment and took it to my primary care doc"
"He looked it over, agreed with me, and prescribed meds"
Now I will say I’ve known him for years and he’s told me I am very self aware
"

Then I felt like maybe I needed confirmation so I went to see a psychologist and we just talked for an hour and when I mentioned wanting confirmation, she was like, “Oh, you definitely have it.” 

I get my meds from a psychiatrist at the same practice because I feel she specializes more than a general practitioner"
And her physician assistant also has ADHD so we always commiserate about ADHD issues.
Lol the last psychiatrist I saw was convicted of defrauding the government around $100k & subsequently retired
"He was a super nice, genuine guy and honestly I don't care if he did it"
I still wish him the best.
All tests we on paper
"He didn't have anyone else fill out symptom reports, but that's because I didn't have anyone who could"
"

Honestly, the self-report was the last thing I did, after all of the other tests, and I was so incredibly burned out by the time I got to it that I just didn't have the mental energy to reflect on every question."
Medicade fraud
My family didn't have steady income & moved around a lot when I was growing up
I had all kinds of mental health issues as a kid & no Primary doctor so I ended up seeing 3 different counselors over the years who all diagnosed me with ADHD
"

The 4th time I was sent in for a fully psych eval at 17 & was also diagnosed with ADHD then"
"It was my most recent diagnosis, and the only one I  actually had the paperwork for, but I moved 2 more times since then and lost the papers"
"

When I tried to get in contact with the psychiatrist, I learned that he'd been convicted of fraud and had retired.

So now I'm an adult trying to get the treatment my parents never followed up on in my childhood"
"Which means getting RE-diagnosed as an adult woman, which is, as it turns out, really hard 😵‍💫"
Wow.
You're a fool.
I'm both single and childless
"I don't enjoy caretaking, domestic work, or staying home, and in fact, I hate it.
I already have an established career in which I am successful on a technical level, but fail in most areas that other people with ADHD fail.

Some people are just not family people, and I'm one of them."
ADHD has a spectrum
For some it can be
Especially for those who suffer from time blindness.
"Trolling that doesn't even attempt to be on topic, lol"
"For context, this conversation has been bothering me since it happened 2 months ago"
"I sat down to write it out as I was getting ready for gym class, ended up focused entirely on this for an hour(ish), and totally forgot about the class that I was already half-dressed for"
Including noticing that I was dressed in workout clothes but figuring I was probably going to go for a walk and that the walk could wait until I was finished
"

Now I owe a fee to the gym for not showing up to class.

Also, it's much easier to make these posts when your phone offers voice-to-text & you can go back and edit after you've said your piece."
I would change my „housewife“ work to my professional work any day
"As in someone comes to my house and does everything, I just sit down and eat and go to work"
Professional life is much easier!
It was so much easier going back to work
"Lol! At home, when you're home all day, you're making little messes all day, and by the evening, everything is thrashed.


When you work and leave the house at 7 in the morning, when you get home at 6 at night .."
*the house is exactly like you left it.*
I could never be a housewife for all that you mentioned
"I barely keep myself dressed and kind of feed myself, and I heavily rely on the person who helps me clean"
I hate organizing and cleaning my house
"I get tired, overwhelmed, and just suck at it because I want to make it perfect, but I get bored and tired"
"

BS pseudo-doctor."
"About a year into being a house-hubby with adhd, I can confirm that the unstructured nature of housework is much harder for me to manage than a day job."
This I'm a RN and worked on acute MH ward being a SAHM was 100 x harder!
I went back to work early after my maternity leave because of how much easier it was to have a job than to be a stay at home mom.
"It's definitely hard work, I myself am a full time dad while working from home in school hours"
 It's been a struggle lol
 I'm on waiting list for Titration now so hoping it helps.
The lack of structure would kill me.
This is me
I was diagnosed at 40 after my then 5th grader (my youngest also)
So for me it was more like 14 years of just feeling like I was scattered and lazy and my brain had turned to mush
I thought mommy brain was just never ending
I will say that it was actually easier when my kids were not yet in school
I did have more of a schedule then
"We did mommy and me classes, sport intro classes through the park district, play dates and other activities"
Now my kids go to school and there is no structure to the day!
"Ah, but those challenges don't matter because the person dealing with them is just a housewife..."
This… I thought it was just me
Couldn’t figure out why my ADD seems impossible when I’m not working
"Had my ex be stay at home dad for years cuz I couldn’t handle laundry, chores and just 1 kid and 2 cats"
I even bailed him out of jail multiple times cuz he could handle it and I client
Twice in one day once! When he stopped having bail I was on my own for most of a year and it felt like never ending hell and I was so ashamed at the disorganized mess
I had a routine with my kid regularly going to Chuck E Cheese (I’d often bring different food and they didn’t seem to care as long as I was buying tokens)
Had to do this cuz at home all I saw was piles of laundry and the dirty litter box and toys
Everywhere… I felt like such a loser.
"I can do work or home well (passing grade well, not superstar) but if you're familiar with spoons theory, it uses up all my spoons, and the other goes down the drain"
Staying employed is what wins out
I need to keep the job to carry the health insurance
"My spouse takes up much of what I can't handle once I am depleted, and frankly some stuff gets done by neither of us"
"I honestly have no idea how I managed to do college so well, because I cannot adult, real-world function for my life! Actually, come to think of it, I think I know"
My mental health comorbidities came out raging around 22.
Report him
Sounds like a Gilead Bro
You should absolutely file a complaint with whatever board governs his position
He can be professionally reprimanded and if this has happened before there can be further consequences
"If he hasn't been reprimanded before, then you have the chance to begin the paper trail so that future victims go in with standing."
He sounds like a creep
Wouldn't be surprised if he thinks HE is the ideal husband to your housewife
Makes me sick
Fire him
"Yeah, the reason he only had one star reviews and could take appointments when everyone else was booked is because he's a terrible therapist"
Maybe he should try being a housewife.
some people just find a position of power and use it to prey on people
"the fact that he hasn't lost his job is incredible- if you wanted to go an extra mile ontop of just finding another psychologist, go report him to whoever you can report him to"
"that's definitely against policy for them, lmao."
Go forth in life with the confidence of a mediocre white man

There are books and podcasts that might be helpful
Reading about ADHD and trying to actively practice the skills / tools helped me a lot before I started medication
I'll say - meds made a huge difference for me
If your GP prescribe based on your diagnosis then it's worth trying
Essentially ADHD truly needs a pills plus skills approach in my experience.
And a misogynist
Hopefully the next Doc will be able to find info of past diagnoses and not this guys rejection of a diagnosis.
SO INCOMPETENT
"Like, full time domestic work is literally the least ADHD friendly occupation on the planet what??? It’s all about repetition, routine, schedule, and remembering 5 lines of tasks at once"
Nightmare.
"Sounds like he needs another one star review (also, now you know why he had space to see you)"
"If it makes you feel any better, I had to wait two years for the assessment with a specialist adhd clinic but it was so worth it because they could see through my life time of coping mechanisms and masking and had the right tools to make a proper diagnosis."
Guess we now know why he had availability…
"Get diagnosed by Circle online, then take that diagnosis to your primary."
How do they help with your memory? I need this too
Call your insurance company and report him
Also report him to your state’s licensing board.
"Make the appointment, then call them first thing in the morning once or twice a week and ask if they have any availability due to cancellations.

They want to have their doctors booked solid and people cancel all the time, so you’re likely to get a sooner appointment if you keep checking with them"
"I had this same issue getting diagnosed, despite ADHD clearly running in my family"
"The thing is, when you get to adulthood without diagnosis or treatment, you tend to get damn good at masking"
"Don’t give up! Obviously get to a different doctor, but also consider finding one who is more familiar with up to date research on ADHD and how it presents."
"Yeah the dumbest part of a lot of those neuropsych evals is, imo, that they test how you do XYZ in a QUIET, EMPTY ROOM with NO DISTRACTIONS"
"No phone, no sounds of other people, plus the added pressure/accountability of the tester watching you"
"Of course I can do your spatial puzzle in that scenario, but literally no part of real life is like that scenario"
I can remember the 5 words you gave me because I'm spending 100% of my brain capacity desperately trying to remember them; in real life you have 200 things to remember for multiple hours while also doing 15 other things.
"This helped thnks :,)"
That was a delightful bit of perspective that I needed to hear today 💗
Explains why he had an opening lol
"Also ‘mind wandering to the furthest reaches of the galaxy’ made something click for me, thanks!"
I got a job at an addictions treatment facility
First job I’ve ever really succeeded at
"I'm in laboratory medicine, check it out"
"Not sure about the US, but in Canada, there are med lab assistants, which is a certificate program"
They perform phlebotomy and process samples for testing
"Med lab technologists run tests, interpret results and report them"
"In Canada, MLT is an accelerated diploma program that's between 2 and 3 years long, but I think in the states it might be a degree"
"

I've been an MLA for 14 years, and I'm doing the pre requisites to back next fall for mlt."
Yep
My brother has hyperactive ADHD and he made a great firefighter/paramedic.
"Live television production worked wonderfully for me for 30+ years, to the extent that i wasn't diagnosed until 60. 
Now a restaurant server- still lots of switching focus and chatting (which work well for me) but not so much creativity / out of the box thinking, great in a crisis, efficiency / streamlining ideas, or pay & benefits."
"And its not the fact that Im bad at my previous jobs, they both have begged me to stay because Im a very good worker, the problem is I get burnt out super easily and feel trapped and idk if its the adhd or peoblems with commitment Im staring my 3rd job this week like I know this isn’t normal"
"Hey, me too! Suddenly my sensory processing issues made sense!"
"To me boring household tasks are so horrible, that it would in fact be better to have a full-time job + household work than to just be a housewife"
"Let’s be real: if I was 100% housewife, I’d end up procrastinating on the household tasks anyway…"
A fascinating question that I'm sure is person specific
"Personally, the lack of structure means that I find household duties intensely stressful"
"With work, there is pressure to show up and do tasks"
"My tasks are assigned, so I don't have to decide which tasks to do, when."
I think work places usually have more structure
"Being a housewife, you will be to create that structure and it’s not always easy when you have ADHD."
 A housewife isnt just house hold chores
"Its all of the family and home finances, meal prep, shopping, keeping track of and doing home maintenance, mending, family schedulingn and care tasks (doctors appointments, school appointments, etc), and so so so much more"
It is a job unto itself and frankly if paid someone to do all of this the majority of people couldn't afford it
"Sure you cam cram it in on the weekend, but a 40 hour work week was made with the assumption that someone was at home doing this work. "
Right?? Some of these doctors are just horrific
"100%! Like it’s famously a chaotic, stressful job ?
Like you said, just no concept of real life scenarios"
Ok
Very odd
How does he expect you to support yourself or pay him?
"The perfect makings of a house wife, why be married when you can be a single housewife 

I mean it makes complete sense if you don’t think about it at all"
"Ok it went from being a misogynistic idea (because we know that wouldn't be his advice if the patient was a man!) to being an actually insane idea. 


This doctor is unwell. 


He needs help"
"Seriously. 


When you report him and write a 1-star review for him, please let them know what idea of treatment is for you and don't forget to add that you do not have a spouse or children. "
I’m sorry but I’m laughing so much at this
"I’ve got not advice, only empathy and the giggles."
Well there's your problem
"(jk) 

How old is this doctor? His advice sounds like it's straight out of [Mad Men](https://youtu.be/bQwgQRQJjfQ?si=QVXEH794xRIzySAh)"
"

May the gods of modern healthcare smile on you and send a less idiotic doctor your way."
And this is where I snorted my pickle I was eating I am officially deceased
"Please, report this guy so that others don't have to be berated by him and his misogyny."
"ADHD a lot more harder to deal with when you are a mom and you need to take care of someone other than yourself, you need to keep them safe"
"Kids interrupt every thing you do, even sleeping, they are loud and messy and you gotta watch them all the time "
It’s obviously someone who never raised any
I hope he doesn’t have a wife and kids
Your doctor has a really weird mindset
I’m sorry you had to deal with this clown
It makes me mad for you
I hope you manage to find someone else.
Lmaooo
Not when there's no children.....
"Except, oh right..your own chores..."
"I don’t have experience with it myself, but I don’t think it’s normal"
Definitely doesn’t always happen
"It’s just unfortunately common enough that it’s a shared experience, dealing with stigma and doubt from new ableist providers about an established diagnosis"
I have a great doctor on there
I see all the horror stories about doctors and ADHD meds and feel like I got the jackpot.
"🤷‍♀️ I'm just sharing my story, no harm done"
I'm also autistic so please be nice.
"First, I hear your pain"
"It sounds like a tremendously frustrating journey and there is nothing worse than when admin/bureaucracy crap gets in our way, the very thing we can struggle with"
"Wondering if you were using insurance at the time of that last diagnosis, or any of the others? If so, the insurance company may have record of it"
"They often require such information for prior authorizations and such, so may have it in their archives"
Really sad that you’ve had such a rough journey
Getting diagnosis and support shouldn’t be this hard or complicated
"Also, if you aren’t already aware ADDA is a great organization offer many forms of support for adults"
"They are a nonprofit and I am in no way affiliated, just a fan"
You can find them with a quick google search.
I never realized how much I miss that until just now
"

I have two beans"
I swear some days I feel like that little cleaning bot from wall E!
"Interesting enough, I found the job easier than being a SAHM"
"The juggling of who gets to stay home with the plague bearers, who picked them up from care, etc was too much for my feeble brain."
Whats a gilead bro?
Nothing will happen
"My last psychiatrist's page from the college of physicians lists the multiple times he's threatened the lives of patients over their views on Israel-Palestine, along with other offences going back 25 years"
"Multiple mandatory training sessions and he still claims to be ""the best psychiatrist in Canada"" during our session"
"The guardrails are broken, if they ever existed at all.

If anyone's curious PM me and I'll send you a link to his profile."
At least if he tried being a housewife he'd realize how fucking stupid he is
"

Actually, he probably wouldn't"
He'd just blame his partner for making a mess.
Agree
"Harass the shit out of them, they'll put you in to a cancelation just to spare themselves."
I’m in therapy after experiencing two significant losses in a short amount of time and my therapist told me I’ve been masking my whole life
"Now that I’m feeling “big feelings”, the mask is gone and I have to relearn everything"
"As an elder millennial who thought she had her shit somewhat together, it’s like starting from zero."
"When I had my daughter tested, the psychiatrist deliberately had her at a desk next to a bookshelf with various objects on the shelf"
"Part of her observation notes included the fact that my daughter couldn’t keep her hands off any of the objects for more than 40 seconds, when the normal for a five-year-old was five minutes.

I’m not sure what the adult equivalent of this would be, but you’d think they’d have that figured out."
Also tests are novel in themselves
Ask me to complete that test once a day for 3 weeks in the comfort of my own room
Then you’ll see me at my true self.
Really? How's the pay?
Haha that’s fair
"I 100% agree with what you’ve just said and how it aligns with my own experiences with ADHD

But my point was that the household chores still need to be done regardless of whether you have a 9-5 or not"
"

Generally people will find having to do both is going to be more difficult than just focusing on one"
"Even if that one is the one you’re less efficient at

So my household chores generally pile up during the week because I have less time to do them"
Then it takes me forever to finish them on the weekend
Yea but my point was that I feel like having a job you will be responsible for working full-time AND taking care of the home at the same time
"You still have to create that structure for yourself, but you just will have to do it when you get home and then have the housework to do

Some people have commented opposing arguments to this, but I think most people will agree it’s harder to do both than to focus on one"
Even if it’s the one you’re less efficient at
"I get that, but my point is that with a full-time job you still have to do all of these things"
"

Households where both partners work they still have to do all of these things"
They just have to do them after they get home from work
"That to me is generally going to be much more strenuous 

Making enough to where one partner can stay home is a privilege that most people cannot afford"
This does not mean that being a stay at home mom/wife is easy
But it does mean you have more time and energy to give to the home
"I'm sure there's psychiatrists who have been privileged and good at the job, but I think you need to understand society at all levels at a basic level (at least) to be able to do the job"
At least they need to educate themselves on society and people! Like wtf
Psychology is my passion (and education) so this sort of thing just winds me up.
"No, no, her ""HUSBAND"", should do that."
"cause she's too busy with the ""kids""..

So when he sends a bill, she can just reply ""oh, I told my husband to pay it, he'll get to it when he does I guess."
"as a housewife, I no longer have to worry about this"
"

And OP can just make a little basket and hang a label on that reads ""paperwork for Larry 🩵"" and throw the bills in there."
"

I'm dying.."
"Bonus points if OP buys a ken doll and some Barby children and shows the psycho psychiatrist pics of her ""family""

🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I'm dead..."
"Doc, find me a sugar daddy"
"Nope, I’ll wait! Since I can clearly focus so well! Get to it!!!!"
"Yeah, it wasn't a criticism of your story"
"It was just that you can't really be a housewife without a partner willing to pull the financial weight, and her psych knew she was single."
"The gilead is a reference to the Handmaiden's Tale, a dystopian book about the total subjugation of women and (I assume) the blueprint for the next 4 years to come in the US."
I was confused as well so I looked it up; it's a reference to the name of a government that consider women as baby makers and don't let them do anything in a book called The Handmaid's Tale.
Psychiatrists hold so much power it’s so scary knowing people like that are still allowed to practice
It’s fkn sadistic shit.
Wow I think I’ve been through something similar
Didnt know that could be the explanation! I was Dx at 6 years old but parents and teachers seemed to just ignore it and parents against meds (it was the 80s & 90s)
It’s so upsetting now to know how differently my life could’ve gone had I been treated as a kid instead of treated like a black sheep
I was always “smart” but didn’t “apply” myself and had “behavioral issues”
Things like getting kicked out of violin cuz I couldn’t remember to grab it from front of class at end of school day (god forbid I got to keep it at my desk!!) and not being allowed into GATE til the last year I could participate (6th grade middle school!) cuz I’d do things like read a book hidden behind my math test or wonder off to avoid boring classes (to the school library mostly 🤦🏻‍♀️)
"

Finally at age 41 got Re diagnosed and prescribed meds, but then the adderall shortage happened and CVS gave me 10 out of 90 pills I believe, and then told me I need to get a new prescription! By that time get another Doctor Who quit the mental health facility that I would go to, and then we moved.

I’ve been dreading starting over cause it was such a demeaning process, but I can’t take it anymore"
I can’t handle Daily life….
"I'm glad they at least take that into account for kids! I did my eval as an adult, and alas the office was very boring, and quiet."
For me as long as the bookshelf has books on it the same test would work
"""Hey! You have X! Is it any good? I didn't like - what five words? Hey, have you heard of what 3 words, it's this cool...oh.."
"the five words you asked me to remember, um...uh.."
"book! Speaking of books, WAS this book any good? Dammit, forget about the five words, answer my question about the book!"""
"Umm, I interrupted my psych guy during my evaluation, and finished his sentence about finishing people's sentences.."
so.
there will be signs 😅
Look up “Marshmallow test”
"Not amazing, but a living wage"
In Canada they are all unionized
"I'm at the top of my pay scale and it's about 58k a year, and I'm in a moderate cost of living part of Canada"
I have to double check the pay scale for mlt but it's obviously higher
"There's more room for advancement in MLT.

What I like about it is that you perform different roles"
"In my current position, I'm trained across 7 different benches and rotate through them"
I'm working in a testing lab that doesn't have patients
"So, one day, I receive and sort the samples sent from all the hospitals and outpatient labs, and then the next day, I am processing critical and time sensitive tests"
"

As a technologist, you usually do one bench for a month, but not necessarily"
"

Look up jobs locally, look for medical lab assistant, lab technician, phlebotomist, and see what they look like"
Check out what programs your technical colleges offer.
"I didn't really get to finish my thought because I was working, and I got busy and had to just sort of post what I had 😂 sorry

I have been off work for extended periods of time for medical reasons, and despite being able bodied enough to complete a variety of tasks, I can not do it"
It infuriates me
"I see it, and I can make lists and break it down into chunks and set alarms, but I can't motivate myself to do it because there's no real consequences"
I don't consider my own displeasure a strong enough deterrent
"If someone body doubles with me, I can get more done, but still not to the satisfaction of ""this is my job"".

Both my partner and I really struggle during the week to stay on top of the apartment"
"I can sometimes get the dishwasher loaded as part of my bedtime routine, but often, they just sit in the sink"
Laundry and vacuuming is a total write-off
"Interestingly, I had more energy for evening chores when I lived alone"
I think I would get bored and start a task
"It wasn't much, but I definitely had less to do on weekends.

I'm pretty confident that if I ended up staying home, as if we could afford it, I would just end up wildly stressed out"
"On the weekends, there's pressure to get the house in shape for the work week."
The post was a bit messy so I didn't catch that part
"Remember I have autism so please be nice, everyone!"
It’ll prove to be a documentary.
"Yep, and it makes you lose all trust in the system."
Oh boy!
Oh I’m aware of it
Incredibly proud of my girl for getting her degree and succeeding at the same job for years despite these and other MH issues.
I just wanted to WATCH the new season coming out in 2025..
I didn't want to LIVE in some totally immersive experience.
Facts
"The amount of times I have referenced that day by day, the USA is further decending into becoming Gilead...

Just come to Canada now, save yourself the struggle later for the inevitable future when fiction becomes reality."
Except now trudeau says no 😅
I’m struggling with that
I’ve pigeonholed myself career-wise
I’d take a huge pay cut to be a bedside nurse again and the specialized nurse practitioner degree/license I hold isn’t recognized/utilized in Canada
It is in Australia
"But the heat, fires, spiders, etc … well I may just have to be ok with all that if the fascism hits that hard…."

Pristiq making ADHD worse?

I’d try to just roll with it at first
"Obviously you’ve got history with the organization but you did say you’re under new management, so I’d try to give them the benefit of the doubt at first.

Especially if you’re in a remote job and organization, I’d take what they said to mean “have your camera on so we know you’re actually there.” 

My work is mostly remote and I’m constantly shocked at how often some people will log into a zoom meeting and then just walk away from their device"
You’ll ask them a question and… nothing
It’s super frustrating to me and I’d be livid if people on my team were doing that
I would assume that that’s what they’re worried about more than if your eyes are darting around.

"emotional dysregulation is considered to be part of adhd

edit:

for op: I deal using meds, and regular potent psychotherapy."
Absolutely
Look up Rejection Sensitivity Dysphoria
Explained so much of my life.
"I’m sorry you’re having a difficult time, friend"
"I empathize with a lot of what you’ve shared here.

Regarding romantic relationships, for me, getting older helped me not to be so desperate for novelty"
"My (33M) partner and I have been together for 3 years, and this is my longest relationship"
"

Be easy with yourself and good luck!"
I can totally relate
"Emotional dysregulation is one of the toughest challenge of ADHD in my opinion.
This is most probably the reason why people with ADHD are often misdiagnosed and/or have Mood Disorders and Personality Disorders, anxiety disorders.

Medications, therapy works for me"
And reading posts and replies on this sub-reddit helps me as well
"It helps me understand my condition, what other people do and what helped them.

And I'm sorry that Medications are limited in your country and it's not an option for you"
It's the same in my country
Only 2 stimulants (Vyvanse is only an option if you've been taking it before you're 18
"So, really just one option) and 2 non-stimulants"
Hope you all the best!
I can relate
I feel like I have more intense feelings than most people and it is making my life harder in many ways
Getting too upset or happy about stuff to the point that I am unable to think about anything else and not being able to let go or get over things easily
Getting too attached to people too fast
I can do months or even years of overthinking and spiraling if someone hurts be
"It often makes it difficult to think rationally about why/what I am feeling or expressing it without basically ending in a breakdown.

Also the intense interest for a while and then losing it makes it difficult to stick to hobbies or anything really"
"Fortunately this doesn't influence relationships/friendships as much for me, maybe it's due to abandonment issues, but I tend to not want to let go of people even if i lose interest for a while"
Often that interest will resurface at some point and I just try to make it through the lull by taking more time for myself and doing other things
"

With hobbies I try not to buy stuff if it's a new interest so I don't end up wasting money and try to rent/use someone else's equipment or buy the minimal stuff I need"
If it still interests me after a year then I can invest more
"If possible then just sell/give away the stuff that you haven't used for a while, at least you will have less clutter and maybe help someone else out."
I cannot for the life of me talk about my feelings
"Sometimes I don’t even know how I’m feeling or why, I’m just very stressed and deregulated"
Dunno if this is ADHD related.
As someone who has been experiencing emotional regulation pretty hard in the past couple years I can get why relationships are daunting and hope you manage to solve the issues.
"I for one am a self aware queen and love to analyse my own existence and why i behave certain ways, what triggers me etc"
but rarely do I let myself just feel the feeling or admit that I am actually upset 💀
I really struggle to calm down once upset or anxious but medication is really helping me with that
I used to cry on and off for days and become unable to function but now after I've cried for an hour or so I can come back to a sort of baseline since being on the right dose of medication
"Nothing worked for me before that medication at all, not even DBT skills.

I definitely dont have ups and downs or mood swings in the tur sense, my emotions don't change fast, they take a long time to shift"
"Before medication, once I was worried/anxious or upset I would stay stuck in in for days usually (if i was lucky it was hours, if i was unlucky, it was weeks sometimes on and off)"
"Now, with medication, I still feel the emotion very intensely but it does go away much, much quicker.

However I've never struggled to identity them or why I'm feeling them"
"Hell, I could probably I've you a detailed psychological formulation of each meltdown I've had"
"The triggers are always very obvious, external triggers that would upset or worry pretty much anyone, I just feel them more intensely and used to take much longer than anyone else around me to come back to my baseline from them.

I've personally never had my mood just shift on its own with no external trigger and/or not known why"
I always know why and it never shifts on its own
"If anything, shifting it is the hard part.

I lose interest in hobbies quickly but not people"
I don't relate to that
My relationships (aside from my most recent where he was abusive) have been quite unremarkable really for lack of a better way of putting it
"

It might be helpful to look into attachment styles to understand patterns playing out in your relationships"
A lot of people with or without ADHD have insecure attachment styles which make it hard to form and maintain long term healthy relationships.
Less dealing with them more identifying exactly what the feeling is
"But overall, yes, it is a very hard time dealing with a strong feeling."
Same I get super emotional..For me seek a therapist to manage emotions...
I can totally relate it's the thrill of the chase then once you've sealed the deal the relationship gets boring
I only had a few long term relationships but most lasted a few months
The one thing I hate about taking my meds is that I feel numb like my creativity & emotions are completely wiped out
I'm usually an extrovert & can talk about any subject but when I take my meds I am super focused but become introverted
It sucks sometimes
It might be the case that adhd is misdiagnosed or comes in pair with borderline personality disorder
"Your story doesn’t sound like ADHD symptoms, but before everyone downvotes me… you are a consequence of your life experience and your ADHD has shaped that"
 For example If you have trouble with impulse control this seriously impacts relationships
" Also it sounds like you may have some attachment difficulties, maybe even an attachment disorder"
No
"For the most part we are just like normal people.

Don't try to make everything about us different or special."
"Agreed, I know this is something I struggle with although my meds have aided me in this regard."
Exactly
Might as well ask “do people with adhd have a hard time focusing?”
we are also more sensitive so everything is dialed up to 11 from what I understand.
"Omg did I just read an article about my brain or something, I never made the connection that this isn’t what everyone feels"
"No, emotional dysregulation is part of ADHD"
And those with ADHD often get misdiagnosed as having BPD because of this.
"How do you mean? I can't say I agree with this (as in, that only those with misdiagnosed ADHD or also having borderline personality disorder can only have challenges/issues with one's emotions) but perhaps I might misinterpreting what you've said."
I have no idea about anything related to borderline personality disorder
Emotional dysregulation is part of ADHD and it’s diagnosis buddy.
Well you can check comments and then talk
[deleted]
i think it’s misleading to say that
people suffer from bpd without having experienced symptoms of adhd in their childhood
"since trauma and it’s development is very complex, i rly wouldn’t say it’s that + that = that"
also there are so many overlapping symptoms of bpd/c-ptsd/adhd which are hardly to keep apart from if u don’t know a person
it truly depends on the person who’s sitting in front of u

"Hey, maybe y’all have like a school psychologist where u can go to and tell them ur suspicion"
I think you shouldn’t worry about that your parents are worried because I’m sure they just want the best for you and maybe they can help you with it :)) I a 100% understand that it sounds very scary at first but maybe this will be an opportunity to work on yourself with a therapist and you get medicated or something :)
I'm a retired male nurse and paramedic and teacher who's 64 years old
I have ADHD and take medication for it
 I found out I had ADHD when I was 47 years old
 The medicine changed my life
 Things got better right away
" My thinking was clearer.

Talk to your school nurse about what you've discovered on the internet about yourself and ADHD"
 Be honest with him or her
" Between the two of you, you can come up with a plan to talk to your parents and your doctor."
"We have a school nurse, but it should still work"
So thanks
I guess I really should tell them
Thanks
"Well thanks for telling me your story, and if medicine is really helpful"
Then I'll tell someone
"Thank u, I feel better"

Absolutely
"  The more stressed I am, the more I lean on my checklists."
"ADHD heightens so many things and stress is a BIG one for me! Stress can make me forget to eat, make me angry easily, create anxiety-like struggles.."
it's not easy
"

I'm very very glad he has what seems like an understanding parent in his corner, though ❤️"
 Totally
"Adhd symptoms explode when I'm stressed.

We stress, but it doesn't show on the outside"
It's more inside our heads
"Thoughts lingering at the back of our brain, forgetting basic things, sleep issues etc.

I have the same problem as your son"
I forget things
ALOT
Walk into rooms not knowing why I went in there
"Placing things in weird places, never finding them again"
"I swear I have had times I couldn't find my house keys, and then my neighbor has found them in the keyhole outside my apartment *facepalm


When I do these things, I usually think about something specific, but since I can't multi-task, thinking about that one specific thing, makes everything else go on autopilot, and when I come to my senses again, I don't know what I've done or where I am going.
Notes hanging around or alarms help me with my issues.
BIG Notes like ""DON'T FORGET TO DRINK WATER"" Which is above my TV, where I can see it 😅"
Yep
 Absolutely
 Stress is a huge multiplier for ADHD symptoms.
"Oh, yeah"
"When I was became an adult, I suddenly experienced symptoms I never did before because of how stressed I was"
"Even though your son is much younger, increases in stress can definitely make our ADHD manifest differently or more severely."
You all have been really helpful with your personal insight and suggestions! He is amazing in so many ways that I think he manages/ masks his symptoms so it hard to see what he really needs
"We’ll make it to the show tomorrow, but will get him an Apple Watch and plus lists with reminders"
Thank you again!
Thanks! This is basic but how do you your checklists? Would a simple list like don’t forget and list his things?  We have tried agendas but he forget or looses them
We don’t do cell phones with him yet so I can’t text him
I know I seem underprepared but it has really exploded in the last few weeks.
The problem with lists is that we lose them
 The problem with planners is that we forget to use them
 The problem with spreadsheets (although so much fun to build and so engaging when making them) is that we get bored with them quickly or forget to update them
 The problem with setting reminders on our phones is is that we think we'll remember to enter them later
" But we don't.

If you have Amazon Alexa devices (or something similar maybe"
" I just have Alexa), you can maybe set routines in the morning that play while he's getting ready for school"
" Maybe have it say, ""Don't forget your backpack and your lunch""   or whatever else"
 That way he doesn't have to remember to check the things he needs to remember
" It's just a quick reminder that he'll hear.

Another important thing is routine and setting things out the night before"
" Get him on a schedule of a specific order and time to do things 

And at 12 years old, it really may be time to start thinking about getting him a phone"
 Both of my kids had basic emergency phones when they were younger than that
" They couldn't go online with them or get into much trouble (limited apps, etc.)"
" But they could call or text us in an emergency and we could set reminders and alarms or text them reminders for things at any time.

But lists are only good if you remember to look at them and where you put them.

So if you try checklists, pin it to the shirt he's wearing, or to his jacket"
 Somewhere where he doesn't forget that it exists or have to remember where he put it.
"Well, I'm an allegedly fully functioning adult, so, and I know it's funny, I have checklists for all kinds of things in OneNote on my phone"
"

For example, if I'm traveling for work, I will literally have a checklist for packing a 3 day bag, and a checklist for leaving the house, so I don't have to come back three times to feed my dog, pick up my wallet, and then my passport...lol

I have similar checklists for daily processes that I need to run flawlessly.

The difference here, I suppose, is I want to use these checklists"
" For a kid, that might be a different challenge."
"Have you considered getting him an Apple Watch? He should be able to get reminders on that thing and it being on his arm will also help with the “out of sight, out of mind” problem most ADHDers have.

That being said, you probably should emphasize he can’t take the watch off outside of the home so he doesn’t lose it"
"And when he does take it off, make sure it’s in front of you or your husband so you can keep track of it."
This is a great idea! Out concern with the cell phone is that he gets easily distracted with just the iPad and looses it all the time
A watch will be harder to loose
"I used the timers/ reminders on it all the timer to help me focus! 
Thank you!!"

Soy milk actually has a surprisingly high amount of protein, so a soy latte can be awesome"

Carrot sticks with hummus

boiled egg
"Love boiled egg.

I have some strawberry protein shake stuff I got at walgreens I drink every day too.

When I make rice, I crack an egg into it and stir it up while its still hot and let it sit to cook in the hot rice for a minute or two, then I add half a thing of ramen seasoning into it (I like to eat raw ramen as a snack, tastes kinda like potato chips and if you want you can dip it in chicken broth)

  
also cheese"
I try to avoid it but it tastes great.

100 g pumpkin or walnut seeds

40 g flaxseed (whole)

40 g linseed (crushed)

30g chia seeds

30 g psyllium seeds (ground)

6-8g salt

If necessary, ½ tsp Schabziger Klee or another bread spice

2"

3
"Pour your bread dough into a well-greased loaf pan and press the dough down well.

at 200°C top and bottom heat for 80 minutes.

Important: Allow the bread to cool completely before cutting and under no circumstances store it in a bread bin or packaged - no, not even in a linen bag or the fridge.)

Cut a slice, toast it, butter and cheese, or tofu and salad on top, delicious"
"or even cut the whole loaf in slices, freeze and then straight from the freezer into the toaster to make it last longer."

"Honestly I have the opposite problem on Dex and have to set alarms to remind me to eat, my appetite is so suppressed I’ve actually fainted from low blood sugar because I just didn’t notice I hadn’t eaten in 36 hours.

But if your ADHD symptoms are well managed man, I would be really really reluctant to shake the boat"
" I’ve never tried vyvance though I have had a history of failed medications attempts and terrible side effects including mood swings, panic attacks and terrible insomnia"
 Which is probably why I would be so scared of meddling with my medication.
Omg I’m sorry to hear that but also low key jealous LOL
"
My appetite and binging is usually so out of control everyday that Dex just makes it like overeating each day"
"
Yes I’ve had the same with meds with having side effects of irritability, rage, mood swings and anxiety which is why I’m hesistant since Dex makes me feel calm and like myself"
"

I know my eating is something I need to work on but it’s been over 15 years of binging and I am so self conscious even when I look good to others so was hoping for some effortless weightloss lol"
God that sucks
 I’m sorry your going through that
" I hate to be like… have you tried ozempic and be all bandwagon-y but I would look at a weight loss or appetite suppression medication outside of your adhd medication and maybe try to solve the two separately rather than one medication for everything.

I definitely wouldn’t go back to the irrational mood swings and insanity again, I’m pretty sure my spouse would divorce me tbh and I definitely don’t want to torpedo my marriage."

"oh yeah, 100%! I was super anxious when I first started (took dexies, then switched to vyvanse 40mg), and the first week or two I ""felt"" it work, and after that i felt no different"
"In hindsight, that week very likely wss a honeymoon period where I *thought* the medication was working wonders because I was just in a really good mood that I finally got the help I wanted haha.

But yeah, vyvanse especially makes me feel like there is no difference"
Some days it feels like I still have ADHD but with more energy
"I'm still forgetful, distractable, still also reach for my phone more often than not to scroll, and I definitely still procrastinate.

I did a lot of research early days of medication (going on two/three months now being medicated), and I made so many posts and even more draft posts asking every question under the sun that I'd end up deleting later because the question was kinda stupid haha.

What I learnt over this time was essentially feeling like the medication doesn't do anything is a *good* thing"
"This sort of sucks though because then and even now, my biggest worry is ""then how do I know if its working or if my dose is too low"" etc"
"

The other bad news is that medication doesn't solve every ADHD problem"
"There comes a point you might need to book therapy with someone who specialises in ADHD, and get help forming good habits"
"The medication doesn't give you the good habits, it just makes it easier to form them.

My advice, is if you can't afford the therapy, actually try some of the motivation advice given by people without ADHD"
"Now that I'm medicated, some of it is actually working now, its kind of funny.

As a side note, I did also go a day or two without medication one time, and did find there was a STARK contrast, and going a day without the medication made me realise how much exactly they were working"

Not really advice but just something I went through
"My memory is all over the place, I remember very obscure passwords for old customers but don’t remember what I ate for dinner 2 hours ago"
"

Annoyingly during my assessment I had to provide examples from childhood and I struggled so much to remember what I was like, I asked my parents but obviously they were not at school with me so they had no clue"
"All I could remember was I was constantly late, in detention, distracting others, forgot homework etc.

When I actually had the meeting with the psychiatrist I was able to provide more examples, which ultimately lead to me getting diagnosed"
"

First step is always speak to your doctor"
If you’re in the UK you can go through the Right to Choose which will speed up the process
"In my case, I went to a psych NP who specializes in ADHD amongst other mental disorders, with the intent of being diagnosed & medicated"
I was in my 30s so I paid for it myself
"I didn't tell my family bc mine don't believe in mental health, they just default to ""you're just lazy work harder"""
"Only a physician, physician assistant, psychiatrist, psychologist, & psych NP can officially diagnose you, not a therapist, counselor, or social media"
A GP or non-psych NP can diagnose but may not feel comfortable diagnosing so they may refer you to the aforementioned psych specialist instead
"I still go to therapy since I still have trauma & medication isn't supposed to be a ""cure"", but it still helps!

I'm not a fan of social media such as TikTok etc due to how misinformed influencers are"
Their intent is to gather views no matter how credible their data are.
The best person that can assess and diagnose you is an ADHD diagnostician
 That's who diagnosed me
 Don't waste your time trying to get a diagnosis from a family doctor or psychiatrist
Go to the top and get the best person that can help you.
First thing is decide what you want to achieve with it
"If your looking for the answer to your struggles or potential treatment then go to your GP/family doctor

Depending on where you are, there could be a long waiting list, in the UK it's years atm"
"Which is where self diagnosis comes into it if by doing the research you find enough to tick the boxes then you are valid to claim self diagnosed ADHD.

Tiktok has and continues to be a great resource to research, unfortunately there are some that glamorise it on occasion"
"If you find your struggles are getting worse after the above, this is normal as you start to unmask.

Speak to your healthcare provider about treatment options if medication is what you feel is best"
"Having ADHD is not a choice, we're born like it and we do and will always have these struggles"
"It doesn't mean we get to use it as an excuse mind, but have compassion for yourself to say this is ADHD and I can't change it but I can find strategies to limit it's impact"
"

Surrounding yourself with other ADHDers may help to as you can share, support and validate each other.

I'll stop rambling now but hope this info dump helps"

"That is a pretty huge mix-up, seeing as how this is a controlled substance"
"That being said, in light of the shortages on this drug and the fact that you are in fact a person with a prescription for it I would not fault you for keeping this little slip up to yourself and holding onto an emergency supply."
That’s very unusual with schedule meds
"They can’t put them back in the stock bottle now, so the pharmacy will have some difficult reports to make"
The DEA will definitely be curious over 60 tablets.
Have you contacted the pharmacy?
you’re not going to get in trouble bc you didn’t do anything wrong btw
Depending where you are located the pharmacy will be in somewhere between a minor paperwork annoyance and major strife
"Where I am, you have to fill a form and send to the department of health to tell them some meds are missing, depending on various factors including the drug involved, quantities and patterns both in the area generally and at the individual pharmacy, it may or may not (most likely not) go to police action"
"Other places I’ve worked the police were the first point of call, their interest in these matters again highly variable depending what else is going on around the place"
Doesn't make sense to return
"They'll have to discard them, not put them back in stock"
I think it's good to have some spares.
The pharmacy will know who the mix up went to when they audit their controlled meds
"They will see that it was him, and he will likely get into trouble if it is not brought to their attention"
Hiding this is now a good idea.
"I haven’t yet, they were closed by the time I noticed"
Calling first thing they open tomorrow morning.
That depends on how they keep track and how well that process was followed
Beyond that there's the issue of proving that OP came to be in possession of those medications
Unless somebody can prove that there were 60 tablets in the pharmacy's supply that were mistakenly put into OP's prescription bottle *and remained there until OP took possession of it* then it's entirely possible to challenge that claim.
Physically BRING the pills to the pharmacy and hand them to the pharmacist
 Explain the situation
 He/She will be your friend forever because you will have just saved their career.

"I'm the absolute contrary tbh, I listen to same 4-5 albums for years, very rarely skip a tune"
"Switching focus between complettely different bands, sounds and styles overwhelms me.
But see it as a strength, you can build EPIC playlists and become super knowledgable about a wide variety of music! You don't have to ""complete"" any album and I don't have to know every band"
"Also keep in mind that not every tune in an album is equally good, sometimes they can be weaker iterations of the same ideas"
"Usually only 1-2 tracks on an album end up being hits, so your way of listening actually sounds very normal to me."
I usually prefer to listen to albums straight through
"Gives me an idea of what an artist is going through at a time in their life.

But I also tend to enjoy concept albums and albums that flow smoothly from song to song."
"Nope, pretty much exclusively albums on repeat"
Sometimes a specific song - 3 on repeat
"The genres of everything varies wildly, though."
"100% same
I never listen to full albums of artists"
"I barely even listen to multiple songs of the same artist EXCEPT one! Elliot Smiths songs are the only ones where I really love the majority, so I'll often just go hours listening through all his albums"
It really depends
I will listen to the album if it’s new
"Otherwise, I choose my favorites and add them to my playlists… yes- multiple playlists, lol"
"
Often, I listen to the same songs over and over."
I’m the absolute opposite
Maybe it’s because music is my main interest (maybe even special interest) - but I obsess over them

I look forward to doing tasks that mean I can zone out to an entire album
"I like to write reviews about them too.

For me, a lot of albums tell a story"
"If I don’t listen to the full thing I feel like I haven’t gotten the full experience as the artist has intended- my favourite songs are often ones that I didn’t initially click with, and have more staying power than instant bangers"
"

In saying this, I tend to add my favourites to a current playlist/ my individual theme based playlists."
"What artist are you talking about?

I love a good solid album where all songs are at least decently good and a few are bangers"
"Most albums have some duds and or filler songs, though."
"I was the same way most of my life until i really got into music! You have to find a favorite band or singer and once you do, you won't be able to put it down"

You probably don't like music that much
If you don't then it's going to be a struggle trying to find something/someone you want to listen to
It's also becoming a passion for me and it's all thanks to Deftones
"They're the reason i want to pick up guitar and i thought about drums as well, but i live with family and they won't like the noise lol."
Not really
"I'll find a song I like, go to the album, and listen to (at most) 30 seconds of the songs there to see if I like it or not and then move to the next one"
"If I don't like the beginning of a song, there's a 100% chance I'm never finishing that song of my own free will."
"No, next question"
Yesss elliot smith..
so good..
so heartbreaking
"I adore SIAMES, it's an Indie Rock band and I've been obsessed with their album Bouncing Into the Music."
"Ah, cool, I'll have to check them out"
Thanks!

"After 30 years of storing several boxes of a “hyperfocus” hobby that I’ll never do again, I’m throwing it all out. Finally."

"Nah, this is just another hyperfocus"
"I call it the ""clean slate"" period"
You're going to come back here.
"Man, too bad you'll be interested in it again next week"
"Lol, JK but for real, good for you if that's what you need to do."
"No! I WILL someday finish sculpting the plastic horse on which I spent my entire middle school allowance to buy tools (sculpting epoxy, an air brush, and a Dremel)"
"

I'm 45"
"

At least I sold the air brush at one point after realizing I literally had no idea how to use it (I mean, YouTube videos weren't even a thing back then!).

Still have that Dremel tho"
Might as well bury me with that thing.
"Don’t just throw everything away, you can sell all kinds of stuff on Facebook marketplace"
You can sell craft supplies as a group and as long as you sell stuff cheap enough people will come take it right from you.
"I had a beer making kit that was used once, I didn’t succeed, and it went in the basement"
It took me six years to accept I was never going to use it again.
"It's an actual struggle to keep your area clutter free isn't it? Sometimes the reason I can't sleep is that I think ""Why the hell do i have that odd bag in the back of the room full of random stuff that need to get rid of \*yesterday\* ""???"
"I did that about two years ago, and my room somehow has filled back up"
😣
I found it's best to find a Russian doll hobby
Essentially a project that contains projects within a project that will lead to never ending amount of other projects
 For me I am fucked
I do miniature painting and I also do wood working
So many projects....
"Congrats, genuinely!"
"As someone with enough clutter that it’s holding me back, great job! Yes, you may be fixating on it right now and you’ll be bored of it next week, but if it’s something you needed to do it’s a healthy one to lean into"
Paper? Cutters? You my neighbor by chance? Lol
"Give them away to charities if you can, after school clubs, kindergartens (if suitable)"
Better than the landfill!
My hobby is hobbies.
Donate it pls!!! I have my own box but I’m keeping it 
"For this reason I have this crafting supplies basket, I'm allowed to have anything I can fit in it, but that's where it ends"
"Right now that's embroidery supplies I haven't used in a year, but I do occasionally grab them, and charcoal drawing supplies that I have used this week, but I also only grab those one a month or so"
"I could fit one more small thing in there.  


 This way I don't clog the house, it's all organised in a neat space, and I don't overdo it"
I'm saved from a lot of temp hobbies just by then not fitting in the basket
Can't fit a sewing machine and masse of fabric in there
Neither will leather crafting supplies fit
And that's good for my wallet.
*looks at boxes full of beads on shelf*
Everyone says I am the weirdest person they know
I’ve left behind all of my possessions and moved far away three times in my life
I have no items of sentimental value and I have come to realize the burden that is ownership
Everything is temporary anyway.
Give it away!
The key to ADHD and hobbies is having enough hobbies that each one feels new again when you come back around to it
"

My hobby cycle includes weightlifting, gardening, knitting, crocheting, embroidery, sewing, hiking, reading, puzzles, cycling, a probably a few more I'm forgetting."
Send me or sell me your jewelry making stuff!! That shit is so much more expensive than it used to be
I’ve been having to clean out my “hobby room” to have a space to host Thanksgiving this year
 It has included the throwing away of “hobby supplies that I will never try again”
 I’m kind of excited though…I have so much room for activities now
 I’m desperately fighting the urge to start crafting bc I need the space to be clean for thanksgiving.
I seriously thought that I would become a jeweller
🤣
"[""Hyperfocus"" is a very poorly-defined word](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00426-019-01245-8) that, in the context of ADHD, generally refers to two superficially similar -- but fundamentally different -- mental states: flow and perseveration.

Flow is a positive, beneficial state of deep immersion and high engagement in a task or activity, and is also usually accompanied by enjoyment of the task/activity"
"It's something almost all people are capable of, and specifically is not a benefit imparted by ADHD"
"

Perseveration, on the other hand, is part of the ADHD disorder"
It is the inability to switch between tasks or mental activities
"It's that thing that makes you spend 10 hours doing something non-stop even when you know you need to stop and do something else.

It's like throwing out your neglected children
Unsettling
I’ll never throw away my cord monster

"😆 yep, at this point I just enjoy the ride - I'm probably going nowhere but I'm really having fun on my journey"
That's what I'm thinking
What's the over-under on the number of days before you start to panic and want all that stuff back.
"I haven’t looked at it in 30 years, I’m not going back there! But I am still holding out hope for my tennis equipment, golf clubs, and scuba gear….."
I need a dremel for the beach glass art hyperfocus that’s coming next spring!
"Good in theory but that makes my crap hang around waaaay longer because I procrastinate dealing with it, posting, taking pics, and *gasp* dealing with the public! But I agree about not tossing it, definitely donate it"
Or do like I do and put it in the back of the car to be in the way for 6 months before I finally get around to donating it.
"I agree with this is theory, but realistically I don't have the administrative function to be able to follow through on selling everything.

And despite it seeming illogical to most people"
"I'd rather take the loss, throw it all away, and enjoy the clean slate and better mental health of being free of all the junk.

I have a partner now that has much better administrative functioning than I do, so if she's willing I aks for her help with managing tasks like this"
Otherwise I just go scorched earth and get it all out the door lol.
"Yeah I understand what you’re getting at, but if I’m doing something with something.

"Every time someone on here suggests we just swap our unwanted hobby supplies with each other, I always agree."

That's having hobbies.

"I’m donating some things to a senior center and other things to a domestic violence shelter but the tole stuff is heading to a landfill, I’m sorry."
Same
I’ll take the beads and scrapbooking stuff to a senior center but I’m going to enjoy throwing every bit of the tole painting projects away
That’s the best I can do.

"I ordered a dumpster for a week because I agree with you, I have a finite amount of time to get rid of my kids middle school class assignments"
They’re adults with significant others and will never look at the stuff I saved from when they were 12
I can send them a photo of whatever cute thing I found but they don’t want it in its physical form
I recognize that I have 7 days to get rid of as much crap as possible before I cease feeling compelled to get rid of anything
Gutting my garage of the things my brain tricked me into imagining was important is feeling really good right now.
"If you start to feel that way, it'll probably just be because you started thinking about that stuff again"

I hate it
"I have had ""sell my vinyls"" on my to do list for 2 years, every time the reminder comes up I just postpone it by a month lol"
It might be the only routine I can stick to

Exactly what it’s supposed to do!
Your brain is able to operate at the speed it wants to
A gross simplification of how it works is that stimulants speed up the highways in your brain
"You're operating at max capacity now, it's great."
Yeajh I feel that too
Pretty awesome
I feel like there’s just more space between me and everything
I'm so jealous of people that take Adderall
"It's alot cheaper and the effects last longer, but i found out the hard way that i'm horribly allergic to it"
I'm glad you're getting its full benefits though
Alot of us ADHDers are still struggling to find the right dose/combo
"I take Vyvanse 30mg and although it helps alot, it's only effective for about 4-5 hours"
I still struggle sometimes with task paralysis and energy levels.
Because it is.
Because your mind is clear and quiet
Because that's the point of it girl 😭🤣😭
How long does this last? I’ve read the effects wear off over time.
Right? Things that I would have to plan out days in advance I'm suddenly just picking up and starting out of nowhere
"It's wild that I couldn't do that before, and I honestly didn't even know it until I started the meds."
"Can u sleep thru the night? If I take 20 mg ER at 8 am, i wake up after 3/4 hours"
"yep, i feel the same"
simple things like calling a store to see if they have a part i need in stock
ordinarily I'd be so stressed about finding the right words to say to avoid my usual word vomit that i end uo never calling
or actually doing whatever thing it is
take my meds and now its simple
i like to use a computer science analogy
 i feel like us humans operate best with a single thread..
our adhd brains are multi-threaded.
except we're not at all setup for that
and it causes us to be all over the place
when we take meds its like our brains can function as they should
now like a 'normal' brain in a single threaded fashion
I feel the same way man
"I do make some small mistakes but more often than not, I always catch them before moving forward."
"welcome to the club!

it’s a game changer when you’re just able to *do* things"
I love modern medicine
So should I feel bad to take it literally every day because it helps me literally every day haha
I upgraded my cpu
"Oh man, I fucking love analogies! I believe it is a common ADHD thing, too"
I also LOVE motor sports
"I always describe it as my brain’s wiring was done by the English and Italian angels up in Heaven, after lunch, on a Friday afternoon, before a 3 day weekend"
The joke is old English and Italian cars often had electric issues that were hard to diagnose because the wiring was a bird’s nest
"And like English and Italian cars, I am finicky, and ideally, I would have 2 brains"
"1 to use while the other is in the shop! But of course, the Italian angels also made sure to install a high revving, high horsepower V12 engine"
"So, I require a little cocktail I like to call, “Jet Fuel”"
"I wake up, and I take the max dose Wellbutrin"
I wash it down with a Ghost or C4 energy drink
"We’re only priming the pump here, folks"
"Then, it’s time for a walk around the neighborhood with my dog, then I hit the gym solo"
We gotta get that premix running through my veins
"After the gym, I take my AM doss of Adderall"
"30 mg of IR, and I wash it down with a protein shake"
Wait 30 - 45 minutes
"Now, we can really open up that V12. "
It can be a struggle for sure
When I was young they put me on Concerta which did absolutely zilch for me and I thought the meds didn't work until I tried again now 18 years later 🙃
Thats really short for Vyvance
I usually get about 8 hours
 But I think we all struggle with those things sometimes even medicated.
For me I have the extended release so it lasts for about 12 hours
"Sorry to butt in, but for me Adderall lasted about 6-8 hours if i can remember correctly"
"It just depends on the person, how you metabolize it"
I only took it twice since it wasn't meant for me
Gave me horrible panic attacks.
I had problems sleeping before the mess so I usually take melatonin at night
Unless I'm working my job in which case I just let it run its course
I take my meds every day
Nth wrong with that
I find it actually helps my mental health better if I stay consistent with taking it cuz stuff doesn’t pile up as much and the side effects lessen
I wear glasses / contacts
"They’re not readers, I can’t see shit without em"
"Would you look at me funny if I told you I only wore them to work / school cuz that’s the only time society cares if I am productive or not? And took them off as soon as I got home cuz I wanted “be a man” and try to “grow up?”, cuz “everyone could probably use a pair of at least readers!”"
"Exactly you upgraded, added a couple of extra cores and hyper-threading capabilities 🤣"
Exactly!
"You filled in the cracks on your road of life, and now you can go as fast as you want."
Tell me about it
I tried non-stimulants first and hated them
I don't have the patience to let it build up in my system and i was afraid of getting anxiety with stimulants
I've struggled with it alot in the past and the thought of panic attacks coming back terrified me
I also didn't see a difference with things like Clonidine
It just made me sleepy.
"I have very high levels, unfortunately and it's torture"
It's also a really common complaint about Vyvanse
It also stops working for me after a few days so i have to give myself a tolerance break or take caffeine with it
I am on a low dose for someone like me though
"30mg is the recommended dose, but that's for people who may not have it as bad"
Not saying they don't
I usually need an increase after a few days
I'd rather have that though than waves of panic after panic
I can always add a booster or take a second dose if needed.
Facts that’s a good point
I guess my only fear is negative side effects
But at the same time me being nerfed out all the time unless I’m on an insane amount of coffee is also a bad side effect
Good point dawg
This community has helped me feel a lot better about a lot of things it’s truly why I still even have reddit thank you 🫶🤙
If the negative side effects get worse than not being on the medication I’d see if there’s anything your doctor can do to mitigate the side effects or try something else
That’s what I did when the medicine to help with my depression was giving me a stimulated appetite that was triggering it.
"same, when i run out of meds i drink like a 4 pack of redbulls a day"
"that was even before medication too, im just always tired during the day."
Dude it’s medication to make you feel like a normal person
Why further hurt your mental health and your confidence by not taking it on certain days?
Eh I’ll see
My dr is kind of a jerk so I just don’t really want to say much other than ask for a refill when I go see him
"Dude it got bad at my old job as a strength coach….coffee at 5:30am getting into work, coffee before the 2nd group at 7:30, preworkout before my workout at 10, coffee before the 12:30 group, coffee before my afternoon groups 😂 my days were long though"
Typically 5:30am-6:30pm with breaks here & there in between…but these “breaks” weren’t really breaks they were just breaks from workout groups
You had to get desk work done during that time if you had any
"Coffee, Celsius, & preworkout were my best friends 😂 if I had adderall back then I probably would’ve liked the job a lot more"
My dr sort of guilts me about taking it every day
He also has made me feel sooo paranoid about the side effects as far as HR & blood pressure
But I truly believe if not my normal XR every day just an instant as needed makes such a huge difference when it comes to calmness and being able to regulate my emotions and get shxt done!
Test your BP and monitor your HR using your watch
Take it in your own hands a bit
Good to be cautious but only if it’s reasonable.
That's pretty old fashioned thinking on the docs part
"Obviously keep an eye on your BP but if it's off, more exercise would be the first and second thing to try, not being inconsistent about your meds"
The ADHD tax we pay when we forget or mess something up is pretty bad for our health too.

ADHD is like having a second brain

Yes I’m on the same and I lost 20kg in 5 months
When I started Elvanse I started tracking my weight loss
"Wasn’t going to gym, wasn’t working when I started it, almost minimal movement"
I was dropping around 2kg a week
This was likely due to my heart rate being higher than normal and the fact my appetite had completely gone
"

It has since levelled out and my weight is staying roughly the same, though I am now going back to the gym and working which is helping lose weight in a healthy way"
A week? That's probably water weight.
They prescribed vyvanse to me as I have binge eating disorder too
I tend to snack when I’m focusing so on this I dont want to.
The first few weeks in particular will be water weight but try to have a big breakfast each day and have a big dinner after the meds have worn off
"It’s not a health way to lose weight (I’ve lost quite a lot unfortunately) and as soon as you’re off them your appetite will be incredibly strong and it’ll come back

Stimulants suppress appetite but, to my understanding, they also increase body temp slightly and heart rate both of which increase your energy expenditure"
The combination creates a lot unintentional weight loss.
Tbh with you I used to be bulimic and after that weight loss after I gain a bit more now it triggers me because it starts up my bulimic thoughts about binging and then purging to stay a certain weight
ADHD can not have an effect on metabolism
"I don't know where you ""heard that"", but you should unhear it and try critically thinking about such things.

ADHD can have an effect on your impulse control and eating behaviors"
"And furthermore, stimulants voth slightly elevate your heart rate and activity level, bumping your metabolism slightly, while also lowering your appetite"
Which is the typical recipe for weight loss
Sorry I did miss a word (like normal) ADHD Meds was what I was trying to say.

"How do people actually ""participate"" in jobs?"

Tread lightly
"Your tolerance will inevitably build up and the gum will gradually decrease in efficacy, which is how addiction starts"
"Also, keep an eye on your gut health"
Nicotine gum chews back.
"You need to do some more reading, nicotine use does pose health risks."
This is not good advice
"First off, you clearly haven't actually researched nicotine at all, because it is well known to have adverse effects and drug interactions"
"You are correct, there is little evidence to link it to cancer, but there is a lot of good evidence linking it to atherosclerosis, and heart arrhythmias"
Not to mention the fact that it is highly addictive
"

The effects of nicotine can also interfere with several mental health medications, and would carry a greater risk of use when someone is also taking ADHD medications"
"I know you are saying people who can't get their meds right now, but if you get addicted to nicotine, you're going to have a bad time when you do get back on ADHD meds if you can't quit"
"

You are an adult and can make your own decisions for yourself, but please do not advocate for other people to take up an addictive unhealthy habit that carries risks with it without advising them to speak with a medical professional first."
Nicotine also causes heart disease
There are safer stimulants out there.
"take a break off it as u have a slow week, just so u dont build a ton of tolerance"
There's some interesting research using patches.
I started out buying nicotine gum in 1996
" I got dentures in 2010 or whenever and switched to nicotine lozenges, which I use to this day.

I never smoked"
 I tried nicotine gum to see what it felt like
 I've just never stopped using nicotine
 I just need to have something in my mouth all the time
 And I like the taste and texture of the nicotine lozenges
 I buy the 2mg full size ones from Walmart and my insurance pays for them
" A month ago, I did a 30 day period when I didn't use nicotine lozenges and I didn't have any withdrawal issues"
" 

I emailed the company that makes the lozenges for Walmart and asked them if they made the lozenges without nicotine"
"They did not.

So, I end up consuming nicotine that I don't I"
"Very interesting, thanks for sharing."
"I find it absolutely hilarious that doctors will prescribe hard stimulants and actual amphetamines to take every single day for adhd, but a little bit of sublingual or transdermal nicotine they treat as a death sentence apparently."

I get mega sensory overload when my meds wear off
"Some days I won’t even take them because I know the comedown will be too much to handle, so I completely understand where you’re coming from"
"

First I have a question… I think Vyvanse is extended release only, right? I’m on a different stimulant so I’m not sure, but I highly recommend ER if it’s not because it gradually goes through your system which makes the comedown a lot less severe"
"

Next, I highly (highly highly!!!) suggest going out for exercise when you expect your meds to wear off"
"I know mine last pretty much 7 hours on the dot before I feel it coming, so I can set exercise in my schedule"
"Whether it’s a run or walk or dancing or weightlifting, having physical input when you’re having way too much sensory input is magical for me"
I’ve realize I can either come off meds and hole up and cry of overstimulation for an hour or move my body and one is a lot better than the other 😅 one thing I have learned is that when there’s too much sensory input you need have sensory output to balance it out
By the time I come back from my workout I have some endorphin boost and the meds are out of my system
Better for me and everyone around me
"

Last, make sure you schedule in time to eat"
I know it’s annoying because you have probably heard the importance of eating when on adhd meds but it makes a huge difference
"Force yourself to eat breakfast when you take your meds, even if it’s a small breakfast"
"Protein heavy, it helps your body process the meds or something like that (I read that somewhere and didn’t fact check lmao, but I think starting off with high protein meal can’t hurt anyways)"
Set a timer for lunch
Force yourself to eat it even if you’re not hungry
Sip on a smoothie or protein shake
"It’s very easy to forget we need food while we’re on meds, or at least for me it is, and when the meds wear off I am not only overstimulated and angry, I am STARVING"
I just didn’t realize it
It’s like the whole days worth of hanger coming out at once
Scheduling in food breaks has helped me a lot
"

Ok that’s all"
Sorry that was so long I rambled a lot (can you tell I didn’t take my meds today?)
But also I feel like this side of taking meds is not talked about enough so I’m glad you are bringing it up! Good luck
"Yess, Vyvanse is extended release! It's the only amphetamine medication we have in Brazil"
"

Exercising near crash time might be a good idea, but only if i would do it alone, which is a problem"
"Where will i find such place? This might be a personal stuff, so maybe you don't understand how much annoyed i get on the crash"
"On my crash, i really want solitude"
"To be alone, no noises, maybe listen to relaxing music like lofi, but no agitation, like, at all.

>(can you tell I didn’t take my meds today?).

That's funny, bcs i am actually the opposite"
"Off meds, i almost don't talk"
"On them, i gain the ability to actually say stuff haha"
I'm crashing right now and people are talking loudly here
S.O.S
send help!!!
Can’t believe there’s only one amphetamine med in Brazil!! That’s wild
Idk if that’s a good or bad thing lol
"

Not sure what your area is like but I have lots of woods and trails near me, a run or even just a walk is always a good choice"
Or sometimes I just lock myself in my room and do stretches for a bit
"Headphones and treadmill at the gym too maybe? Or headphones on a walk in the neighborhood sonyou can tune everything out! Everyone’s different with their needs so honestly just try things out and see what works, but for me the biggest thing has been exercising to help curb the anger and big feelings I get"
"

I hope you can find some peace and quiet away from people hahaha"
Noise cancelling headphones and a locked door can do wonders 🙌
">Can’t believe there’s only one amphetamine med in Brazil!!

Yes"
"If for some reason your treatment demands a short acting amphetamine, you're doomed.

>Not sure what your area is like but I have lots of woods and trails near me,

That sounds good"
"I mean, it genuinely sounds good"
"I would love to have such places to walk at night.

>I hope you can find some peace and quiet away from people hahaha"
"Noise cancelling headphones and a locked door can do wonders 🙌

For now, thankfully i am already at my grandma's house"
But i don't know how i'm gonna fix this for the long-term
"I have to share a bedroom with my brother(very loud, noisy, expansive person) in my dad's house, there's no extra bedroom and we just moved there"
I honestly feel like i'll have to jump to a new place(once again) cause i don't feel like sustaining this for the long term

Terrified of asking people personal questions 

First time taking medication

"You can take a second dose at like noon, that probably won't mess with your sleep (at least it doesn't for me)."
Hey there! Adderall kicks in much faster especially since most people are prescribed IR instead of ER (Instant or Extended released) which causes a crash for some people
You could ask for an increase or as the other commenter mentioned you can take it twice a day
"Some people add a booster that they take in the afternoon which just extends the one they're taking, but since you're just starting you'll more than likely just get an increase"
"You could also ask for an extended release which means it'll take longer to kick in, but you won't crash as bad."
"If you just started the meds, your body will need time to adjust and your doc will most likely titrate your dosage up in a month or two"
"I started same as you, 10 mg XR then moved up to 15 mg"
"Ask your doc for an afternoon IR booster, it’s very common"
I began experiencing the afternoon crash but now I take a 10 mg IR booster around 2pm
Gets me through the end of the day and doesn’t affect my sleep at all
"Meds are miraculous, I wish I’d started them at 22 rather than 55."
"Okay, I’ll probably try that on Friday, so that if it does affect my sleep schedule, it’s okay because my weekends are free anyways"
"Yes, I’m on the Extended release, that’s why I was a little confused when I felt the come down much sooner than expected"
"In a month a have a check in appointment with my doctor, so if this problem remains consistent during the month, I’m likely going to up my dosage, OR get a secondary IR dosage for the middle of the day"
Thank you for all the insight :)
I’m very glad you reaffirmed a thought I had when I got home
I verbally said “I think I might need an IR too”
"But yes, I’m going to give it the month like my doctor advised and then I already have a check in appointment with him for the end of that."
Yeah my doc initially offered the booster when I first started on the XR but I dismissed it as I thought I wouldn’t need it
"At some point I really started to feel the crash and my afternoon workload increased so I asked for the booster, it’s been an excellent solution"
I don’t even take it every day but it’s nice to know I have the option
"You’ll get there, just takes time to find your sweet spot"
Good luck!
Thanks!

"Have you tried lisdexamfetamine? Many people I know, actually all the people I know with adhd, prefer Vyvanse over Ritalin"
"Many experience that the side effects are milder and the effect is just as good, in my opinion they are better"
"Works perfect for me, I have only tried Ritalin though"
"My son tried Ritalin when he was 8 or 9 and he had so many side effects, he just didn't feel anything and stared straight into the air, he hated it, also got nauseaus and stuf"
"Same with my husband and his daughter, and my best friend"
I crashed when the effect wore off and I felt weird
"On Vyvanse the side effects weren't nearly as bad, and the tiny crash only came the first 2 days"
I really reccomend trying Vyvanse 😊
"So you have tried alot of different drugs for adhd, and they don't work? Are you sure you have adhd? Many other things can have the same symtoms as adhd"
"Depends on so many things, what your symptoms are, how your life has been, what you expect from the meds etc"
"Difficult to give advice without more info, but I am really sorry that you haven't found anything that has helped you with what you are struggeling with 🫶"
What do you mean nothing? Maybe you don't have ADHD or you didn't get the right dosage
"I'm with ya! I've also tried Ritalin, Adderall, and Strattera, tried different doses, and while Adderall worked a bit, I was afraid it would further damage my already damaged liver"
"My doctor just this week told me that he's ""reached the end of his knowledge"", and suggested that I see a psychiatrist"
"So, I guess I'll do that"
"Coincidentally, I'm also in the PNW, lol.

Gentle hugs and sympathy to you."
"i haven't! my psych didn't even bring it up on the list, I'll see what she says, thank you!!!"
Stimulants are effective for %80 of people..
"and some people, like me, cannot take stimulants"
"

Something to think about, certainly"
"C-PTSD, certain Autism presentations, Bipolar (especially II), etc.."
but there are a lot of people with ADHD for whom meds don't work.
"Sorry I didnt do much detail 😅 Adderall, ritalin and stratterra did help my adhd but the side effects were too aggressive, thats the most annoying thing"
"I was functioning great adhd side with the old ones and but with this, even though I dont have intense side effects, it hasnt done anything for adhd haha"
"Just not excited to try yet another med and having a late night looking for some hope out there, 
ty for the sympathy 🫶"
"oh man, hugs and sympathy to you too!! I hope you get a great psychiatrist!!"
It's more and more common where I live
"Ritalin is still first choice, but my impression is that ""everybody"" is on Vyvanse"
"It's also the first choice for people with addiction, because it doesn't hit harder if you snort or inject it, because of it's metabolism"
"Also think it's because you don't get the same ""high"", though I think the feeling I get from Vyvanse is better than Ritalin, but it's not as strong when it comes to the side effects imo.."
I think the positive effect is better
Idk.
"oh man, sorry you cant take stimulants! Alos this is good to know though, ty for the info"
"I'm going back to the one I had do my assessment, she's great! I hope your situation goes well too!"

"I know where you’re coming from, I recently restarted my meds last week after years of doing without them"
"As an adult in my 30’s now, I’m having to build new habits"
"I also sort of expected to magically start being more responsible and efficient, but I think I’ve got to give myself time to develop new routines"
I have noticed that making myself complete a list of needed chores is much easier than it used to be
Part of it is that I’m still currently fascinated at how quiet my brain is and how nice it feels to be able to relax instead of fidgeting or jumping up to pursue the random impulses that pop up in my head.
nope the stimulant isnt going to make you magically motivated unfortunately
it does half of the work - your silly lil brain still has to initiate the task at hand
"The way my doctor explained it to me, was that medication would definitely calm me down, and keep me much more focused for extended periods of time"
"BUT you can still focus on the wrong things, now when you’re unmediated, a hyper fixation can be very difficult to pull yourself away from"
"When medicated, and with a little self awareness, it’s much easier to be able to snap to the task that needs to be done.

I still give myself a little wiggle room to “waste” my time, but I have made a deal with my brain that it will only be for a certain amount of time"
"So sure, watch YouTube, but tell yourself you’re only watching that one video, or you’re going to get to work in 10 minutes"
That helps me out A LOT
"

But that’s my brain, for all I know this method is garbage in your eyes"
"But it’s worth a try, if it works let me know."
"Woah, i cant wait to try meds, my doctors appointment is in a few weeks."

I've heard that different people react different to different meds..
"Which is why the process of finding out what works, takes a long time"
You should talk with your doctor/psychiatrist
Different for everyone
"
But I don’t get irritability with concerta / slow release ones"
"I’ve found that Vyvanse BRAND NAME doesn’t for me personally, but I also don’t feel a “kick in” and come down like I did on the generic"
"I thought it kinda sucked at first because it doesn’t zone me in to focus as severely, but I feel more balanced overall which helps the other adhd symptoms.

I personally also realized that the irritability was often because I was hangry due to the appetite suppression…."
"Vyvanse is the first ADHD medication I’ve tried, and it works for me"
"

Some background: I have PTSD that causes all the ADHD symptoms, so I’m treated for ADHD and diagnosed with both"
I have a natural tendency to become irritable and anxious simultaneously when my PTSD is triggered
"

Vyvanse has helped immensely with keeping my triggers at bay because it has lessened my rumination immensely"
"I can much more quickly attend to myself when I feel triggered, which helps me battle that irritability before it manifests into behavior"
"

Everyone is different"
"If you’re becoming irritable on meds, your dose may need adjusted or a different med should be tried."
I have Concerta ER 27mg
calmed me down rather than made me angry
I am usually generally very irritable etc
"and taking Concerta makes me less easily frustrated

But its different for everyone"
They all like to put people on antidepressants I dunno why
If Adderall XR is giving you those problems I'd try Concerta or Focalin both are stimulants 1 is methylphenidate the other is Dex methylphenidate
It's a bit stronger than Concerta
As for anxiety my doctor placed me on Xanax
"I dunno you are on a very low dose compared to most people, take me for example, I'm on Adderall 30mg 3 times daily so try out the Concerta or Focalin."
Lisdexamphetamine is better than methylphenidate if you have anxiety
"I take Guanfacine *and* a stimulant, and that works for me.

Have you tired other stimulants? Or XR Adderall? I take Elvanse/ Vyvanse and it's a lot gentler (for me anyway), than others I've tried."
Had the same issue
The best results were from an 18mg slow release Ritalin prescription
Don't know what its called
"I still get irritable, but not like I used to"
Its far easier to control and the come down isn't as aggressive.
It’s highly individual
I find that it also depends on what else is going on in your life
I’m 48 and have been off and on meds for nearly 30 years
I’ve tried all the commonly available meds in the US 2-3 times
"Sometimes a med will increase my anxiety, sometimes they won’t"
"For example, I’ve been on Vyvanse three times, years apart"
"The first time it worked great for my ADHD symptoms, but made me extremely emotional"
"The second time I tried it, it increased my anxiety and only had a mild effect on my ADHD"
"The third time I took it, it was like taking a placebo, no effect at all on my ADHD or my anxiety."
People hyped up Strattera to me but I felt zero effect
You might be different!
"It varies by all accounts but I had the same issue on adderall, more mood swings, jitters and anxiety but super good concentration / focus to begin"
"

Now on Ritalin which is smoother overall but can’t say that it helps me focus as much which is disappointing"
"

Holding out for vyvanse but will have issues getting my insurance to cover it… this shit ain’t easy."
Vyvanse and Trintellix
Anxiety and depression are co-morbidities in many people with ADHD
The Trintellix is off shelf anxiety drug originally  for depression.
"For me Elvanse eradicated general anxiety, for a friend it did the opposite and Ritalin eradicated his."
NaD
Personal experience
"

I started on Vyvanse which made my anxiety worse and caused a lot of irritability"
"

My doctor immediately advised that I would probably need a non-stimulant medication"
"Guanfacine was their first suggestion, but my insurance wouldn’t cover it so we went with Atomoxitone instead and it’s worked really well for me"
"

I also take bupropion (originally started it for depression) which is known to help with ADHD."
"Talk to your doctor for sure, but I did hear Vyvanse is intended to be similar to Adderall but the affects are a little “smoother” and could cause less anxiety and irritability"
"I don’t have any experience with switching personally as I’m on Adderall myself, but this could be an option to go over."
"I was having that problem, too"
"I take generic adderall and Venlafaxine now



The only down side is having to eat with the venlafaxine"
I find adderall xr to have lessened my anxiety which has been great
Not sure if that’s chemical or if it’s down to my being more productive and falling behind less in my life
"I find eating well, (enough protein and whole foods), drinking enough water throughout my day and getting enough sleep keeps the irritability at bay"
Everyone reacts to meds differently
"If yours make you feel bad, discuss it with your doctor so you can consider other options"
You deserve to feel the best!
Adderall gave me horrible panic attacks when i started on 10mg
I switched to generic Vyvanse and it's way smoother
Less side effects and i'm prone to anxiety
A shot of caffeine is enough to increase my heart rate
"I was jittery the first day i took it and i had a mild increase in heart rate, but it's alot more tolerable"
"I get temporary anxiety during every increase, but it doesn't last longer than 2 or 3 days"
Also subsides pretty fast whereas Adderall induced panic lasted for hours
Vyvanse is also only available in extended release so it'll take longer than Adderall to kick in and it's not as strong
That's why it doesn't cause as much anxiety as Adderall for some people
Adderall hits you all at once and that's whats causing the anxiety
It also serves as an antidepressant for me
I feel alot happier and my mood just overall improves
Everyone is different though
What may work for us may not work for you
"It's just trial and error, but doctors recommend either Adderall or Vyvanse since it works for most people."
"I was taking adderall for about a year and a half, I switched to vyvanse recently and it is so much better for me, it’s hard to describe but it’s similar to adderall without the highs and lows and feels less like an upper, i don’t really have anxiety but if I did I imagine I would get far less from vyvanse, it’s hard to describe exactly why but if you tried it I think you would understand what I mean"
"This is such a tough question, bc everybody is so different"
"I take a 20mg XR a day, & honestly most days I get a headache when it’s wearing off, I’m hungry, & I crash out"
"Oh yeah, & then anxiety is a hit or miss, but I believe it definitely makes mine worse overall"
"Ugh, these dang drugs man…"
Do you consume any caffeine?
Different folks different strokes
I placate my irritation with that by focusing on how much faster it is to figure out if stimulants work for you than any other psych drug - antidepressants and shit like Wellbutrin you have to titrate up SLOWLY and titrate down off of instead of just quitting when it doesn’t work for you
Having to take both types of drugs I argue with any psychiatrist who wants to address depression and anxiety before thinking about adhd meds *in patients who have already not had success with 2+ non adhd drugs for the symptoms they currently exhibit*
"I get that a lot of adhd symptoms *in depressed or anxious adhd patients* can be mitigated by antidepressants and anxiety therapy/meds, but it’s also true that adhd meds can lessen symptoms that result in anxiety and depression! And frankly dialing in my non stimulant drugs has always been such a slog comparatively, a very difficult and long journey compared to stimulants - yes, MANY stimulants haven’t worked for me, but I could always just opt out if I didn’t want to deal with side effects for the day, unlike antidepressants or mood stabilizers"
"

So my suggestion is to just start and if you feel more anxious back off"
Try to figure out whether you’re actually anxious or anxious about starting a drug or anxious about getting anxious
"That can be tricky.

Nonstimulant adhd meds are different and now what I meant in the above sections"
intuniv I found mildly useful to mildly useless; for some it’s the godsend mood stabilizer or thought slower or anxiety reducer they need
Strattera gave my already crappy stomach horrid pains and I didn’t see any improvement; I’m hard pressed to recommend but I’m sure it works for some
"There’s a third type of nonstimulant but I haven’t tried that one yet.

For anxiety, I think beta blockers aren’t used enough - some people find significant improvement in anxiety symptoms just from a pill that stops their heart from racing, which in turn limits the feed back loop that gets them spiraling"
"I found it very helpful, when I remembered to take it"
Ativan was helpful but I would equate it to solving my anxiety with a beer or two because that’s how it feels.
Azstarys is a very smooth stimulant even at higher doses
"Different for everybody but you could try Guanfacine, it's a nonstimulant"
"Not totally sure about all your symptoms but I have ADHD, anxiety & depression"
"I take Adderall ER, Wellbutrin ER & Lexapro 😅 I hope to not be on all of them in the future but I work in child welfare (and am sadly looking for a job in a different field) & my current job worsens my symptoms and makes me spiral every few months ☹️"
Wellbutrin XL opened a whole new world for me
10/10 recommendations
"Others have already mentioned trying other meds, and I ended up having to try too.

Started with Vyvanse, which was better than no meds but it did make me gradually more anxious and irritability"
"Switching from Vyvanse to Dexedrine ER helped me a lot (even though both meds share the same active compound, but packaged and released differently)"
"I can elaborate more on this if you want.

But I want to give an additional perspective on this, as food for thought (if you identify with this) —

I went through several months of titrating with Vyvanse, complemented with Guanfacine, and later added a booster dose (of short-acting Dex) into the mix"
"After that, to keep things simpler and have my primary dose be more effective, I switched from Vyvanse to Dex ER (but still on Guanfacine.)

With Dex ER, I'm more self-balanced, but not without zero anxiety and irritability"
"After some reflecting, and observing the differences in thought and behavioral patterns between the two meds, I've come to think of that lingering anxiety and irritability as a good thing"
Because it's not the kind that used to stop me and send me down doom-scrolling internet rabbit holes
"It's the kind I'm equipping as evidence (maybe subjective), giving legitimacy for the need to act upon those feelings.

Before ADHD meds, I used to be stuck"
"Unable to act, drowned in both general anxiety and anxiety due to ADHD-impairments in quality of life functions"
"Meds changed that by unlocking me.

However, I occasionally felt waves of anxiety, irritability and restlessness, less because of meds, and more because I was starting to act on things and get things moving"
"And depending on what they are, they're either resolved by action, or reveal more things to do that I just didn't know of before as I was stuck and didn't act.

Also, I observed that Guanfacine was the bigger source of anxiety and irritability when I was titrating its doses; I was extremely restless and irritable to the point of being snappy"
"It built up gradually, over a week or so, till I realized that it was the increase in Guanfacine's dosage (from 2mg to 3mg) that made me so irritable.

I eventually understood that ADHD meds (and combinations), are to help me _unstuck_ myself, exactly while in stressful and anxiety-inducing circumstances; where I can pause, breathe, and take a moment to collect myself, instead of being consumed by overwhelm — actively trying and practicing lifestyle and behavioral changes, telling myself to slow down, to feel all senses, expressing sources of irritations by translating them to feedback to others, restructuring life and priorities, and more.

If you find it hard to think and act on those lines, perhaps the ADHD meds you are prescribed aren't helping you best"
"

So, depending on how you're feeling, increased anxiety and irritability may not necessarily be signs that the meds are not working for you, but the exact opposite, that they actually are"
"I think, a more important question is — can you do something about it? If yes, my advice is to slow down, take it easy, and take baby steps to get through; because you know you can"
"If you don't feel _that_, then maybe it'd be good to try something different."
"welcome to the side-effect circus! Here, we take medications to treat medications that medicate our medications!

It’s daunting"
"But seriously, don’t give up."
I think extended-release is one of the issues you have because you have no control over the peak
I have been on various medications for 24 years and for the majority of them the only time anxiety creeps in is when you don’t have anything to focus the medicated energy on
I take Adderall but manage my dosage throughout the day and over the week to only use it when I have the type of days at work or social events where I know it will benefit me
There’s nothing worse than taking a stimulant and being idle.
"Unrelated question, but does the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy work for you so far? I might try to look into it once I decide which university to attend since I believe mine goes past the meds too"
Also I highly recommend talking to whoever handles your medications because I had a similar issue
Adderall 20mg made me irritable and I tended to be more isolated and not social
"It also made me more depressed, but I loved what it did for my school work"
It also caused me intense nausea and changed my appetite
"Now I am on Vyvanse, and I dont have any of those symptoms as intensely as before, but the focus I had with Adderall is still unmatched"
It is different for everybody so I still recommend talking to your doctors !
"I went through Vyvanse, Adderall ER and Foquest (methylphenidate).

First two amphetamine based medications had quick activation of the sympathetic nervous system and also rapid loss of focus and attention"
"

Foquest seems to have much smoother curve so I’m sticking with it"
It has been over 4 months or so since I started using the new medication.
"Started adderall, mental health is overall better, reduced anxiety/stress, OCD symptoms better, everyone is different though, some other people feel like they are going crazy on adderall, there isn’t a definite answer, the best way to tell is just to test each one at the guidance of a healthcare professional."
I am hearing that ADHD plus an anti-anxiety med is the hot go-to right now.
Whichever one works for you.
"That really depends on the individual person, no one size fits all solution unfortunately.
Stimulants may have a calming effect on some, whilst it would drive others to climb up the wall.
Non stimulant meds like Clonidine may call down anxiety and irritability in some, whereas it may make others feel like they have less agency or sedated beyond normal functional.

There are many more types and variations of meds out there, those two are just examples of massive treatment iceberg, both of which luckily work for me.

Sadly, best way to find this answer is through multiple visits to a Psychiatrist, and understanding your individual / family medical history."
"Guanfacine is prescribed to treat both adhd and anxiety (both are established, off-label uses.) I can vouch for its effectiveness, but I have low blood pressure and could jot continue taking it"
Really the best adhd med I tried (I can’t take stimulants.)
"You could try Wellbutrin, aka bupropreon"
"It's worked for some, but can also heighten anxiety"
"As others have said, funding what works for you is trial and error"
It took me a while
Adderall XR 10 mg is perfect for me.
Gotta hit that combo and medicate both.
Wellbutrin is good for me
I think it’s different for different people
I’m on 15mg of XR and _without_ it my anxiety is much worse but I also notice I’m more irritable on it
"Is it possible to go back to 5 mg? If you’re feeling anxious and irritable, that may be a sign your dose is too high"
"Also, there is a non-stimulant drug called Wellbutrin"
"IMO, it is a true “miracle” drug"
I say that because it is a jack of all trades
"It can serve as an anti depressant, mood stabilizer and while it is not a stimulant like caffeine or amphetamine, it does have stimulant properties"
It also aids in the metabolism of Adderall
"So, Wellbutrin + 5 mg of Adderall may be the ticket. "
I take Adderall 10mg
"I was on a non stimulant first, increasing the doses for a while and it did nothing for me"
"Like, not one thing lol

Then I went to Adderall XR, and it was hit or miss on if it worked"
"I also had the issue of it keeping me up at night, because sometimes I needed it later in the day, and if I took it too late, I didn’t sleep that night"
"And I already have major insomnia.

Regular Adderall, works way better for me since I have more flexibility on when I can take it"
I don’t get any symptoms with it
But I’m on a lower dose and don’t take it twice a day or everyday.
I'm on Straterra and Buspar that i take in the morning
It's not even recommended for adults to take Guanfacine
"However,  I take 1 mg at bedtime"
I can't imagine trying to stay awake or drive a car after taking it!
Guanfacine is better taken at night (because of the drowsiness and fatigue
That’s what the doctor told my husband to do
"He takes an antidepressant as well.

As for me, Adderall and Mydayis made my heart race, so I can’t take those"
"I also tried Azstarys, but it made me really irritable"
"And Vyvanse worked well, but if I missed a dose, the withdrawals were horrible.

The med that works best for me is Adzenys"
I take a mood stabilizer and an anti-anxiety med along with it
"

ADHD meds aren’t exclusive… it’s not ADHD meds or antidepressant meds"
Your doctor should have prescribed both.
"Therapy was of limited effectiveness for me, since there's a lot that can't simply be talked out"
"

Focalin made me more irritable and had a prominent crash, whereas Adderall is pure calm, focus, and balance"
"Perhaps it'll be the opposite for you, don't discount stimulants just yet."
100 mg Wellbutrin
Wait half hour
Then take 30-45 mg of dextromethrophan (OTC cough depressant)
"

Absolute life changer"
"Concerta XR release has been great for me, didn’t even need to try other meds."
I take Guanfacine ER and Buspirone and Pregabalin for combined ADHD and anxiety.
Adding lexapro helped my anxiety
"I'm a little late, but I'm 36 and was diagnosed in 2008 and have tried EVERYTHING"
"10mg lexapro 5mg 9 am, 5mg 9pm and 40mg Jornay pm"
It's basically overnight adderall
It works through the colon and has no instant release functionality so you gradually wake up ready to go and it pulls of slowly.
Wellbutrin made me SO freaking irritable
The worst
"Focalin has been the med for me so far, no irritability or anxiety at all"
Strattera is a non stimulant that may help
Generally ask about non stimulants
 Vyvanse and take breaks when you need them
I don’t like being “on” every day.
I’m on Strattera specifically bc stimulants increased my anxiety.
Just gotta try other medications
Adderall lowers my anxiety and irritability. 
"Are you eating enough protein or drinking enough water? I find that my medication works best when I eat it with a protein dense meal, and I need to consciously drink water"
"Also, antacids increase the absorption of stimulants, and citric acid decreases the absorption"
"Make sure you get enough sleep, protein, and water"
I also found great success when working with an ADHD coach to come up with tools and systems for myself
"Keep trying - it’s not a magic pill, you have to work with it to make it work."
Strattera and Vyvanse are the only meds that I haven't felt more anxious or hyperactive on
I hate ER
It gives me anxiety and migraines
Switched to IR and wildly everything went away.
"Vyvanse, clonadine, guanfacine.

Adderall and Ritalin Both make those worse"
You know having that extra serotonin can really help with anxiety
Also sleep because it is a precursor to melatonjn
Id suggest vitamin D3 if you dont want to be on ssris
"yeah, other comments seem right on this one"
you just have to go trial and error until you find the right one
adderall xr 30mg for me is perfect
"i would reccomend maybe asking about nonstimulants? you mentioned strattera, so that would probably be a good starting point if that is what your psych recommends."
I tried the stimulants but it seemed to make my anxiety worse
What ended up helping enough was Wellbutrin
I do have some short acting stimulants I take a small amount of if I really need to have a focused day
But yeah Wellbutrin seems to help keep my ADHD symptoms to a more manageable level.
Guanfacine (Its for blood pressure but extended relese works for adhd.
I notice that whenever I'm off my ADHD meds for any reason I'm even more irritable and more of a jerk than normal.
"In my observation, the most effective “medication” for treating anxiety is psychotherapy, with a minimum of weekly sessions over an extended period"
ADHD medication likely addresses around 30% of the overall issue
"Within this 30%, the choice between Adderall, Concerta, or Vyvanse makes slight differences, but none fundamentally alter the outcome."
"A clean diet, no caffeine or alcohol and an hour of exercise everyday."
"Yeah, that's unfortunately what I am figuring out"
I just really don't want the tired or fatigue side effect from  ADHD medication and I was possibly worried that Strattera would make me tired but yes I'm gonna ask my doctor these questions too this week
But this figuring out thing is costing me so much 😔
Guanfacine was bad for me…
Made me irritated
me too take concerta + Wellbutin
"… worth noting, if you’re uninsured (or don’t have great coverage) it’s heinously expensive"
Will chime in and say my Vyvanse comedown does cause some pretty intense anxiety at times
"Sometimes I don’t notice it, but sometimes my BP drops and I become lightheaded and really have to ground myself."
YESDD the vyvanse generics SUCK! Teva Vyvanse was a godsend for me
The generics aren’t nearly as good
Most insurances won’t even cover it because the generic is on the market.
"Huh that is interesting, I noticed that my rumination can sometimes get worse when I have taken my adderall because then I can focus on overthinking more"
I could talk to my doctor about what they think of prescribing vyvanse for me.
30mg x3?? Damn
Source?
Lisdexamphetamine is turned into dexamphetamine in the body
"Adderall is dexamphetamine and levoamphetamine, not methylphenidate."
I did this for a long time
Recently quit taking the guanfacine (lost my insurance and wanted to see if it was worth the cost) and can’t tell the difference.
"No, just the Guanfacine and Adderall ER"
I have thought about asking for Vyvanse too because I have the side effects can be less severe
I also do guanfacine and a stimulant (methylphenidate) but had to cut my stimulant dosage in half because it was causing major fatigue otherwise
Meds are weird.
It just made me extremely sleepy
"Obv not OP, but I don’t use caffeine"
It’s an instant anxiety trigger for me
 Do you?
Yeah I have realized that my anxiety and depression have worsened when my adhd is worse so I think they are definitely related
I do kinda worry about taking a non-stimulant daily because I have liked not taking stimulants on the weekends but I didn't know if that was actually a good idea or not
I have so many more questions to ask my doctor now lol
I am literally starting CBT tomorrow so I have no idea how well it work
The first psychiatrist who diagnosed me told me that medication will help my symptoms of ADHD but the CBT will help me function with things that the medication can't control
I also think that just talking to a trained professional instead of friends or family about my issues with my ADHD will be way better for me
Hopefully it goes well but it kinda took me awhile to realize that I probably need both medication + CBT
"I would recommend looking into it though, can't hurt to try!"
How long did it take for you to work and at what dose? I recently started it and I'm yet to see any positive effects
I'm just more distracted than ever
I'm on 150mg XL.
"Yeah I definitely agree, I think I need the therapy more than the medication"
I have weekly meetings set up with a therapist for CBT starting this week
I just wanted to see what medication helped others but I know that it affects people really differently so this post is kinda a shot in the dark
I have been dealing with this for 42 years
I got diagnosed this year
You'll pull through
"Esp when you have to.

Just try do do things in your speed and find routines that works better, until you get the right ones👌👍"
"Unfortunately, it's hard to say what will make you tired or not"
"For example, I'm reacting better to short-release meds, but for many other people it's the complete opposite."
I'm on Adderall 25mg extended release and I dint experience any of your symptoms
"It actually lowers my anxiety. 


Meanwhile, Strattera made my heart rate skyrocket 130 laying down, 150+ standing up"
Closest I've ever been to passing out and I spent the night in the hospital.
Have you try ritalin class of stimulants?  They can be short acting
"I'll say with Strattera, as far as I'm aware how it impacts people varies drastically"
It actually has given me more energy when I'm noticing it rather than less
"That said, soon to start 80mg and I've been sick the past few weeks"
"I can't attest to how it affects me beyond 60mg, and the being sick has left me unable to say more than ""I didn't notice any side effects"" when going from 40 to 60. "
"I know, it’s such a shame"
I go off of my parents insurance this year and am terrified.
"unfortunately it’s one of the only meds where the difference between brand name and generic is hugely different, I don’t even know how they can call them the same medication! Not sure what I’m going to do next."
"Vyvanse for ADHD, mirtazapine for anxiety and propranolol (beta blocker for anxiety)has been a winning combo for me!"
"Vyvanse and Adderall are pretty similar, both use dexamphetamine as the active drug"
"The difference is that Vyvanse first has to be processed by the body before being active and Adderall *also* had levoamphetamine.

They aren't that different, just so you are aware"
"But, also, if your anxiety is triggered by the levoamphetamine in Adderall it would also be a huge difference for you.

Hope this information helps you."
Yes..
and I am in Europe
I have had Concerta and Elvanse
No Adderall.
"I definitely can, but I have the emotional dysregulation symptoms pretty badly, plus trauma that gets triggered every now and then, so Guanfacine has a purpose beyond just taking the edge off the stims."
They definitely are for me
"IR stims are often not a good fit for those of us who are anxiety prone or sensitive to stimulants, because they have the harshest come ups and come downs."
I think mindfulness exercises can help with slowing down and being present enough to notice if taking stimulant breaks on the weekend was helpful or notice if you feel more anxious
It can also help decrease anxiety
It’s scientifically shown to improve pretty much all aspects of mental health so why not give it a try? I had to drag myself into it but I’m very glad I finally decided to give it a try
It won’t solve all your problems but like neither will medication for most people - people who find a medication that fixes EVERYTHING without having to do therapy or find tune anything often didn’t have many problems beforehand lol they JUST had adhd
If you have a history of feeling anxious you’re likely going to continue feeling anxious on adhd meds even if the adhd meds help…
"Anxiety is just kind of hard to treat with meds unless it’s like the only issue (like being anxious the world will end but being able to run your life well - the meds might help there)

Caffeine also might have to be cut out"
Some people can’t do both stimulants at once.
"oooooo, will do! Good luck!"
"Yea, I started on 150 as well"
"Tbh, I noticed the “stimulant” effects right away"
"I started going to the gym when I started getting mental health treatment, and my doctor told me not to take Adderall before the gym but Wellbutrin was fine"
I noticed I’d get a little kick like if I had a double shot of espresso
"I actually asked about “feeling it” more, and was told it’s something that just kinda builds up in your system"
"However, I have been taking it for 3 years now and I think I have built up a tolerance to it"
That’s just me though
"There were a few times I had issues getting a refill, and I did notice I hadn’t taken it"
"Keep in mind, everyone is different and I think for anti depressant type meds, it can take like 2 - 8 weeks to see an improvement"
"Personally, what I do, is I got a $1 notebook from Wal Mart"
Like the ones kids use at school
And I write notes of how I feel on the drug
That way I can bring it to my doc so they see I’m trying.
I responded well to short-release until after I had my daughter
🤷🏻‍♀️
Even the generic is wildly expensive
"If it works, it works! TBH I adjusted other meds (mood disorder) which is probably why I ended up not needing it anymore."
ER and XR are the same thing (extended release)
Maybe you're thinking of IR (immediate release)?
"Yes, typo"
"Fixed it, thank you."

I’m not sure why but my brain shuts off like this sometimes too
It’s like a computer that has tons of random programs and windows open and running then suddenly they all freeze… and the task manager is off on a lunch break 😂
That's a very interesting question you ask
I do recall as a teenager catching myself tuning my dad out even when he was in my face...
"scary as it was to not listen to him, I still couldn't focus some of those times"
I do think we sit or brains down for various reasons as protection
Unconsciously most likely
"

I'm sorry she cussed you and I can feel for both sides"
It's hard having adhd...
"and it's hard being in relationships with us adhd folks, too"
Hope your day gets better!
There's fight flight or freeze and the zoning out sounds like a mix of adhd and a freeze response
"This all makes sense, nothing here is out of the ordinary"
I want to reassure you of that first
The brain absolutely tunes out traumatic things
"You don't feel your anxiety very well when you have ADHD, your brain moves to fast"
"That zoning out and tuning her out and the ""numbness"" when it happens is anxiety, being masked by the ADHD"
"Doesn't mean you have an anxiety disorder, just how the brain responds in that situation.

  
Unasked for input- No, you shouldn't have yelled at her, you should've been more straight forward"
"""Hey do you mind holding on please, so I can focus on this."" Although, she should not have responded how she did"
"Both are inappropriate, and imo, her response was very toxic"
I really suggest this being a conversation you guys have.
Those of us who have ADHD tend to have issues with multitasking
I can’t concentrate or focus if I’m being distracted by my wife at times
"She has ADHD as well,  to a lesser degree than I in my opinion"
Interruptions are very frustrating
"If I hyperfocus on something and tune everything else out, that’s when a little trouble happens sometimes but we understand each other and work through it"
I can’t have music or a HD monitor on with streaming services when we talk with each other
I’m so easily distracted by things in my environment and the numerous minutiae of things going on in my brain
"Therapy helps me, though I’m still trying to find the right RX to slow down the racing thoughts that interferes with falling asleep"
My wife can fall asleep in a minute or less
I envy her for that
At least we can joke about our quirks
I can change the subject in a second and quip “now that we’re on the subject”
"With all that being said, I’m still blessed because every day she can make me smile and laugh, too"
Best wishes to you.
I agree that both of could have done much better and since you pointed this out I’d like to ask what I could do to help her
She often times admits to being hyper sensitive to people being mean to her so I try my best to be delicate with her
I admit that for this instant I was probably being mean but what do you think about her other times being hypersensitive and what could I do to help?
I mean
I hate to be that guy but therapy is the best resource
"Look into DBT therapy, definitely for her but maybe for you as well"
It’s a lot different than conventional CBT because it teaches skills and what to do in the moment
If you want to look at STOP it’s a very basic and fundamental skill
She just has to practice mindfulness
“Is this response effective and rational” is a good question to ask herself
Look into “you” statements as well
Changing how you talk to each other is such a crucial thing
If you dm me I can send you something on the “you” statements.

I feel defeated...

"I forget exactly how I found where to get one, but I think I just called a local low-cost clinic and.."
asked if they could do one
"And they said yes.

I think the best thing to do, though, is ask your doctor where to go for one"
"They told you get one, so they should hopefully know where to do that.

I don't know if insurance will cover an EKG"
They're kinda expensive at around $100-$350..

Ask wherever you plan to go for an estimate
An EKG is no big deal
 It's done in the clinic room and takes only a few seconds
 Doctors order them all the time.
Do I have to get a referral from my neurologist to get one from my GP? Or can I just make an appointment for one without a referral? They are both in the same system

"hiya! obviously take this as you may, I’m not a doctor andddd everyone’s bodies are different of course"
I also take concerta (36mg) and a ritalin (10mg) in the late afternoon
I thought about increasing to 54mg (because I’ve been on this dose for almost 2 years) and my psychiatrist was down to try
I felt the types of side effects when I increased to the 54mg
"Weird vision things (spots & also like I couldn’t get my eyes to focus), a stronger heartbeat & increased anxiety"
"When I lowered my dose again, the uncomfy side effects were settled within a couple days and I felt like I could breathe again"
"I’m mainly commenting because you mentioned your psychiatrist increasing your dosages further, and I don’t think that is going to help the way it’s supposed to"
"AGAIN I know I’m not a doctor and you definitely should discuss with yours, but as someone who doesn’t like Vyvanse, I get the frustration of just wanting meds to work the way they’re supposed to etc etc"
"I hope this ramble makes sense, good luck!💛"
"Ok guys I took concerta 72mg for the first time and I feel like a new person!! This is how I used to feel when I first started taking meds for adhd, so I’m very excited! I’m ready to tackle the homelessness crisis and world hunger🤩"
"Your ramble makes perfect sense☺️ he’s actually giving me 36mg so I can take 2 together for 72mg, so I might even try to take just one and see if that works before going that high! I even told him I was apprehensive about increasing my dose since it seemed very high and may be more harmful than helpful, but I was down to try it since I don’t have the training he does😅 on the other hand, we know our bodies best so if I have a feeling it’ll be bad, I want to trust that… It makes me hopeful to know that you’ve experienced those symptoms as well and that they went away once you were on a lower dose… thank you for your input!!"

"Slightly easier to not give in to sudden impulses, but not always.

That's about all I get."
"Calm, focused, attentive"
"The downsides of the concerta credits: itching, dry skin, frequent urge to urinate"
Descent more marked with the credits.
"Tasks feel weightless, to do them doesn't feel like walking up hill"
I never knew it wasn't meant to feel that hard
"On meds I'm not stuck in a box thinking about what I need to do, but unable to act"
There's no resistance
I just do the thing
Brush my teeth
Do my homework
Do dishes
Workout
"

Tldr: drugs are cool 👌🏼"
"Boring and frustrating imo
But also useful and helpful and powerful
But also narrowing and rigidifying
But also white calming and enabling 

It’s complicated "
Different drugs different people
I was so excited but stimulants messed me up after the initial calm
Atomoxetine seems to be working quite well for me.
It’s so individual!!! But I understand the question - I wondered about that too
"The only way to know, is to have the experience, in the end"
"My personal experience on Ritalin IR =
1"
"I feel I have a new, reliable, consistent member of my internal support system"
"And that it’s a great “leader” to have when I am making decisions, getting tasks done etc"
"
2"
"I definitely feel, and am, more efficient and productive 
3"
Ritalin is also a separate treatment for daytime narcolepsy
My afternoon crash/brain fog/energy drain/collapse is no longer there
That’s amazing for me
It’s like afternoon was a time zone that didn’t exist or “add anything” to my days and now I have won back time
"To have energy that flows all day long is actually very redemptive on a deep emotional/psyche level.
4"
"I am completing things and hard or boring things seem easier or do-able.
5"
I have more clarity and am making better decisions
"This is also because it has definitely reduced impulsivity.
6"
I have a new confidence in myself and life which generally makes me feel safer and lighter
"I wasn’t unhappy before meds but I was often overwhelmed and exhausted by all the sub-effort and energy I had to put into doing even the things I love, and a feeling that I was never quite reaching a potential that was available to me but needed a “missing piece” , a piece of something I just didn’t have"
"
7"
Cupboards have been organised and filing done that had been undone for an embarrassingly long time
"And it didn’t take long or feel so hard and anxious like it would have done pre- meds (hence why I avoided doing it at all)
Many of these things in a day to day level express themselves very subtly, but when I really take stock, the “little things” Ritalin has done for me are big things.
Of course it doesn’t solve and resolve your whole life - nothing does"
There are no magic wands and we each have to learn through challenges and find our own way - but it is a hella support
"
I was worried I “wouldn’t be me” or would lose the strengths my ADHD gives me - but if anything, I feel a more grounded, present version of the me-I-am.
My one piece of take-it- or-leave-it advice is give it time"
Many people give up on meds too soon
Your mind -body needs time to adapt and adjust
"Also, keep using and developing healthy, helpful strategies and be kind and patient with yourself because you, like everyone else, are human and doing your best and you deserve to have a peaceful, happy, imperfect life"
Good luck!
For me it makes me not overthink or worry about unnecessary things
"Prior to taking medication, my adhd caused clinical levels of anxiety so it’s been a very freeing experience."
"Assuming you have ADHD and haven't been misdiagnosed, you'll most likely feel much calmer and have an easier time regulating your emotions"
"It might not feel like anything, but you'll probably find that you focus better, that you're less stressed, and generally able to handle life's twists and turns better"
"

I was very anxious about taking mine for the first time"
"An hour after I finally took it, I dozed off on my couch."
It feels like relief
"For me, medication is like putting on sunglasses when the sun is burning your eyes, or finally walking out of a super loud crowded public place"
"It’s my brain finally having external and internal filters, which means there is quiet and I can control what I do and don’t pay attention to and what I think about"
"This also means that my overwhelm, which I always thought was just severe anxiety, is gone"
"Unmedicated, trying to do a task is like fighting through a crowd of people to get to something"
Most of the time the crowd is just too big/ strong and I can’t get through
"Medicated, there is no crowd to fight through"
I can just go ahead and get done what I need done without the struggle
The weirdest part for me is the being in control of my actions/ emotions
"Unmedicated, it’s like there’s someone else steering the boat and I have no control regarding where it goes"
This part was weird because I never realized how much I relied on impulsivity for a lot of stuff
"Medicated, I have to make the decisions and steer the metaphorical boat"
"When I first started medication, I would wait for something to happen but nothing would"
I kind of had to learn how to purposefully decide what to do/ when to do it.
I am also high functioning
Always worked and never skipped
Never too late
"Been a nurse for 11 years, like to educate myself"
"I try to eat healthy and work out, not that I always succeed 😏

For me the most noticable effects are:
1"
"Being able to do more of the things I hate, like in the house"
I am able to finish a project and keep intetest for a longer period of time
Feels amazing
Life changing actually
"Also suddenly got a lot of hobbies because of this, like cooking and gardening"
Had none before
More motivation for things
"

2"
"Decreased appetite, which is a very common side effect, and I have been over eating my whole life"
"That being said, after a while appetite is back, but not in the same scale"
"

3"
No overthinking
"I used to get emotional about things, now I just don't care"
"I care about the important stuf, I really do, but I don't care about the things that my mind used to make up"
"

The negative effects: 
1"
Hyperfocus on things I shouldnt do
"Like sitting on my phone playing games a whole day.

2"
Not working out as much as I should
Just don't feel like going to the gym
"I never really did, but I still did it, now it's harder to go out the door.

And most of all, I feel good all the time"
"I neve struggled with anxiety or depression, I've always been a happy person, now I am even more happy"
"thats another question, i head alot of adhd'ers talk about the ""quietness"" they feel when on meds"
"and I'm not really sure if I'm experience a ""loud"" mind per say"
"When you describe the quietness, your not talking about the brainfog quietness, where its more like a loud hissing or buzzing that makes it impossible to think, how would you describe it?"
I personally wait for my morning dose to really get to work before thinking about coffee.
Its very unpredictable for me
"Sometimes i feel nothing, sometimes i feel more alert and energizeg, jittery and anxious…"
Either nothing or negative
Give it a try why not
Test things out.
Tasks feeling weightless is the perfect way to describe what it feels like for me to be medicated.
This is probably the most helpful response I've read so far
"My main issues right now are 
1"
"Memory, short and long term
2"
"Procrastination 
3"
"Again like you mentioned, almost no hobbies beacause my day to day tasks seem very laborious.
4"
"Catastrophization and spiral

I still have an above average college gpa, and am holding a work study job which offers a lot of flexibility"
I think it's like being in a loud room for hours then finally stepping outside and hearing only quiet nature
You forget how loud it is
I'll be medicated soon (hopefully)
"It does help with brain fog, too"
"But mostly, my impression is that I usually have thousands of thoughts at once fighting for attention (lol) so I can't see the forest for the trees, and with medication, I can ""hear"" an individual thought, decide to listen to that one thought, and follow it"
"So basically choose what I'll focus on, at least to some extent"
Helps me stay more present.
"Loud mind for me was rapid consecutive thoughts, making connections between random topics along with my worries and depressive tendencies laying into me all at the same time"
"Once I started meds, I can safely say I only have one thought at a time now, and I can pause between thoughts, basically eliminating the chance of a spiral"
"This allows me to focus better as well, but it's not foolproof"
"Too much stress or something emotional can kick up the gears, and your brain will show the meds whose boss"
But definitely more pros than cons
"Every individual is different, though"
"I wish you luck, and I hope they help.

A loud, high-pitched tone is tinitis, is it not?  (Not sure about buzzing or hissing)"
"I can (almost) promise you that number 2, 3 and 4 will be different"
"It's not like it's gone, I still have to convince myself to start sometimes, but I am able to finish and it's almost kind of fun to do things I hated to"
"Still have a pile of laundrey from time to time, right now the kitchen is a mess, but overall, it's not like it used to"
"I am still a human being, and I believe everyone struggles with doing things, but for me it has been extreme"
I used 4 years to paint my livingroom where I lived before
Now I just painted the livingroom in our house and it was easy
"And I have never been a lazy person, I just couldn't do things"
And feeling bad for not doing it was so stressful
"I have an extremely good long term memory, I remember so much from my childhood and people are often surprised of the details when I describe how things were in their houses and stuf"
"Short term is worse, I forget sometimes, but most of the time it's when I decide to do it later"
Things that have happened and things people say I do remember
"Wish you the best of luck with your new life, hopefully 🫶"
"ok that actually makes sense, when they talk about the ""loudness"" I always assumed that was referring to intrusive thoughts, but I'm starting to realize that the loudness usually doesn't have a single complete thought, its more like a background hum of noise, which I definitely have almost all the time, I drink coffee like an addict because it quiets it a bit"
That is a way better description than mine!
"I appreciate that, really I should say my issue is short term as opposed to long term memory."
"Do you constantly have a song or jingle appearing in your head? Or just a rhythm in your fingers? That goes away, or reduces."
Does the song only play on one part but loops constantly even though you know it doesnt and it's just that one riff over and over again
very very much so.

As far as I know the only thing that you really have to avoid is vitamin c/citric acid as it does make your body metabolize the medicine faster
I've found that once I started to be mindful of that my medication is more effective
Taking with food and avoiding coffee will help it be more effective
"As someone mentioned, avoiding citrus"
"

Have you considered asking your pharmacist? They have access to info sheets for all the medications they carry and can often provide excellent advice about interactions and efficacy!"
"I took my medicine around 10am and the biotin gummies around 2pm, is that a good enough distance away from each other?"
Not necessarily true
"Vitamin c and other acids increase GI acidity, resulting in less absorption"
"This is theoretical, no studies have confirmed with consistency that acidic beverages or fruits hinder amphetamine absorption"
They have nothing to do with CYP2D6 which is the main enzyme that metabolizes it
"

A low urinary PH will increase excretion of non metabolized amphetamine but redbull or orange juice isn’t going to affect it that much"
"Meat, starvation, dehydration will"
"Alcoholism also increases cyp2d6, so alcoholics need a higher dose because of that"
"

Tums also won’t work, the amount of tums you would have to eat to change GI PH would basically be the entire bottle"
This was confirmed by multiple pharmacists across the internet
"It’s placebo 

However, multiple studies have shown that amphetamine is absorbed more on an empty stomach vs when eating"
It’s recommended to eat an hour after medication
"But if it really kills appetite, don’t do that"
Eat before
"

Caffeine decreases the effectiveness of amphetamine when taken before amphetamine"
But using caffeine after taking amphetamine increases the effects of amphetamine
It’s a strange relationship
Yep
It’s an hour on either side. 

I get SO mad when i see the symptoms of a child devalidated

The most you can do is politely say something to the mom about your own experience
"She will probably blow you off, but at least you’ve said your peace"
"

But I would encourage to read your post again"
You’re upset because you were reminded of your experience
"It would probably be helpful to talk to a therapist — not a psychiatrist, a therapist knowledgeable in ADHD — about your experiences and help yourself find peace"
I know that’s easier said than done but you are understandably struggling with what you lived through and it would be helpful to have a professional to work through that.

Is it worth getting tested?

It really doesn't hurt to get an overall test from a neuropsych
It's not really an ADHD test but rather a test to identify any issue you may have
Which can also be nice if nothing is wrong too (like peace of mind I suppose) and if anything is wrong you can seek appropriate treatments.
"Maybe look into the symptoms and have a think about how much those affect you?

Once you look into it you might find it it takes a lot of of you to stay on top of things? 

If its not really making your life harder you could save on the consultation or you could still do it for your daughter and learn how to navigate it together."
"Is there any pressing reason for you NOT to get tested? 

I don't think there's a right or wrong answer, but people are giving you reasons and you're saying ""is that enough though?"" I dunno, is it?"
Yes it is.
"Im planning to get tested in a few days, I was alrdy born with LD and ADHD but want to know if its my fault being lasy or my parents were right all along"
i think it’d help in terms of your daughter just so if she copes differently you can help her
"With a diagnosis comes the option of medication, knowing what is ""wrong""/different, and getting a different view on coping, get more help at work with coping with symptoms"
"

I got diagnosed at 35ish"
I didn't know if I needed meds but wanted to give it a try
"

Turns out, my main coping mechanism was anxiety"
I'd use anxiety and adrenaline to push myself through ADHD issues without realizing it
"

ADHD meds have let me use *better* coping mechanisms, other than my anxiety"
"But it was hard to learn those new coping skills before medication let me do the work to learn them.

I'm so glad I got diagnosed and attempted medication"
"If I hadn't benefitted, I could have just stopped them."
It comes down to whether or not you plan to medicate? My wife and I have similar struggles with our daughter (7) and I am diagnosed with ADHD
"The truth is you can explain to her that she is both unique and at the same time many others struggle with attention etc without labeling her.

We decided to guide her, use certain techniques that have worked for me, show lots of love and patience"
"It’s a struggle but I think meds and ADHD diagnosis are overly abused in the US, especially when you compare to other western countries.

That’s just my take"
Please do your research and see what makes the most sense for your family.
YES
"as someone who is a woman only got diagnosed after I pushed for it at the age of 24, I beg you to test her"
"If it turns out that she doesn’t have it, that’s fine"
"But if she does, I can’t possibly put into words how valuable it will be for her"
"It will save her years upon years of struggle and hardship, difficulty relating to people, difficulty understanding her own emotions and thoughts"
It will save her from emotionally berating herself for years.
Thanks
I guess I have coping mechanisms
"Like I am constantly chanting to myself ""don't put it down, put it away"" so my house doesn't become a pigsty"
I have days at work when I am so distracted I get nothing done
And other days at work where I finish something and realise I haven't moved for 10 hours
"I have insomnia due to whirring thoughts, and I dream code solutions (I work in IT)"
"
I guess I just thought this was just me being me until I started looking into adhd for my daughter.
Overall I get things done, so I figure I'm doing pretty well, whether I have a diagnosis or not.

I guess I'm asking: What are the benefits or detriments to getting diagnosed as a functional adult?"
Hmmm..
maybe I'm looking at it from the wrong angle
Thanks.
Thanks
That makes sense.
Thankyou
She is struggling at school and with social interaction because she's too distracted and is too in people's personal space
"So she is going to be trsted.

Me on the other hand.."
is the a reason to get tested?
Thanks
She is absolutely being tested
The post was about whether I should get tested as an adult
Like is there a point in getting tested? What are the benefits?
I got diagnosed as an adult earlier this year
"For me, the main benefits were having a reason why I do certain things and access to meds"
"

The meds enable me to focus while I’m at work, changes tasks much easier, have much less resistance to starting a task, things like that"
"I am also no longer counting the minutes until I can leave, instead I look at the clock and go “damn, it’s 9 already?”

There’s also carry over to the home environment as well, where the meds make it easier for me to do chores, help curb impulse eating, and take care of other responsibilities that pop up."
"From what you say, seems like while your methods work it's probably taking a decent toll on you whether on not you feel like you're doing fine"
"

Getting some therapy and/or access to meds could leave some mental energy to relax, do other things, prevent burnt out just in general reduce stress and improve sleep quality.

Not to mention you could get access to help at work and other places that would make it easier for you to succeed without feeling like you're putting in 110% just to reach the bare minimum."
Oh yeah that sounds just like my daughter
Especially the personal space
Didn’t even realize that was a trait
I think it’s useful to get yourself tested
You can do a self assessment
Which is what psychiatrists will ask anyway.
My mom would tell you absolutely get tested
She didn’t get diagnosed until after I did when she was 51
 It brings clarity and meds make life 1000x easier
Why make life harder than it is?
Thanks.
Hmm..
"I never even thought about therapy or meds for myself! 

I don't relax"
"I always have to be doing something.

And I would never bring this up at work"
I have Lupus and I don't tell anyone at work
Discrimination at work is definitely a thing.
Thanks.

Hated it

Where are you coming from? I changed from concerta to dexamfetamine"
Changed my life

I put a half a dozen eggs on the cooktop to boil once and ended up falling asleep for three hours
 Woke up to the sound of the smoke alarm and the smell of burnt eggs
 All the water boiled away
Scared the hell out of me.
I know right now this seems like something you can't get past
I was there just a few days ago
"

Just remember that a lot of people who don't have ADHD leave the front door open, or the oven on, or accidentally leave a child at school"
"The mind works in funny ways! 

Maybe you can think of a system to avoid this happening again, like a stop watch on your phone.

Anyway, what you've experienced is not uncommon"
"I don't want to say ""calm down"" but just know that you can get past it."
"Once, probably because I bumped into the edge of the oven while walking, I turned the hob on very low"
"And, because I tend to forget that I even have a kitchen, I didn't notice for a very long time"
"Basically, no fire risk at level 1 for the time being"
"It's just stupid that, because I like to put things where they don't belong, for some reason I still had a kitchen scale on the same hob"
"Or rather, after a while, a pile of melted glass with melted plastic and melted batteries"
"

Since then, every time I leave the kitchen, I panic-check every single button on the hob"
That probably won't happen to you again
Always set a timer when you put something on the stove or in the oven
That always helps me.

Vyvanse makes me pee 24/7

SAME
not sure what to do
Right now I work from home so it’s not a huge issue but it’s very very inconvenient.
"That is how stimulants work


That being said, what signs are you using "
"When you say you feel yourself getting dehydrated, do you mean your mouth feels dry? Dry mouth is a side effect of the meds and doesn’t necessarily mean you’re dehydrated."
I have the same problem but I've learnt over time that I'm peeing too much because I've been chronically dehydrated in the past
So basically before I got meds I wasn't drinking enough water
When I got meds I couldn't ignore the thirst anymore (from being dehydrated and the dehydration from the meds) and I drank a lot of water
I could not stop peeing BUT after I drank enough water for a long enough time I stopped peeing so much
"So basically I'm saying, keep drinking water when you feel like drinking water, but drink small amounts more frequently"
Pee when you need to pee but keep up with the drinking water and maybe like me you will stop peeing so much.
You might be drinking too much water??? How do you know you’re dehydrated?
I have a similar issue
"It’s getting better though

Try and cut the caffeine out altogether, I drink k decaf now as it helps me keep my routine"
"

When drinking water I take smaller sips more frequently, rather than big gulps like I was at the start because just so thirsty

Get yourself some Celtic sea salt and some limes"
"Drink this with some water 2x a day

Avoid the Gatorade and any electrolytes that have sugar or sweeteners"
"I know, it’s a boring life but it’ll just make you more dehydrated"
lol same.
Use an electrolyte powder to stay hydrated
"It might make you *feel* dehydrated but if you’re peeing more than ~6 times a day, you’ve got PLENTY of fluids in you"
"If your pee is clear, you’re actually causing problems in your body"
"

If you’re drinking a lot of water, please make sure you have enough sodium intake"
I’d recommend getting your electrolytes checked
Overhydration can cause serious problems over time.
"OP, that's concerning! Fwiw I've been on Vyvance 70mg and it just seemed to do what I've been told coffee does to normal people =\ don't recall hectic peeing listed as a side effect, might want to check in with the GP/psych that prescribed them

Unrelated note, reading the title of this post made me think of that one Austin Powers scene rendered me useless for 5 minutes"
"Are you drinking when you feel thirsty?

Are you eating fiber rich foods?"
I was peeing a lot more on
"Vyvanse before I:

-cut back my caffeine consumption to 1 half caf coffee first thing in the am
-started eating a high protein breakfast before taking my pill
-stopped taking my pill w vitamin C and/or orange juice

I still drink more rr water than the average person and pee more as well, but it's improved with these measures"
"I just permanently have dry mouth on the meds, doesn't mean I am dehydrated."
"To everyone:

YES I TRIED ELECTROLYTES OR DRINKING MORE WATER.

YES I AM DEHYDRATED BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF WATER THAT EXITS (via urination) + ALL THE SYMPTOMS."
Lots of drugs dehydrate you
I would hydrate really hard when it wears off and before you take your next dose.
In my case this eventually led to a sterile uti after a year or so
 I had other many side effects which ultimately caused me to stop taking it
"I saw one of the comments mentioning flomax which is for prostae, but I am a girl and my psychiatrist say no when i asked if there is anything could be done for the side effects that i was experiencing."
Yeah vyvanse does that
Also makes me have 0 appetite
Eat more fiber to hold water better
I had the same experience once or twice in about 2 years
"I didn’t even drink something but went like 7-9 times to the toilet in the morning, while still lying in my bed"
Like every 10 minutes
"Not some drippidy droppy, no! Actually full on pee sessions"
I wondered where all the liquid came from.
"It's possible a higher heart rate has increased your body temperature resulting in increase thirst, dry skin/ lips."
I honestly stay away from vyvance
I had too many personal nightmare experiences from it myself
get your blood sugar checked
I'm a retired male nurse and have ADHD
 I take Focalin every day
 Go to your regular doctor and ask him/her to do a PSA test and manually check your prostate
" You may need a prescription for Flomax.

Flomax should address urinary frequency and peeing in small amounts"
 I take Flomax and it works for me.
"Yes, I drink even more."
"my lips and skin getting dry, just all dehydration symptoms"
2l of water is not too much at all
Might be a lot if OP is sedentary but if there is any physical activity involved in the day it might even be too little
"I function best on 1,5 l of water a day, on days I SO NOT work out"
"My brain just needs water, ESPECIALLY if on days I take my ADHD meds."
Why the sea salt?
"the problem is, I do take electrolytes as well"
It does not matter tho as water just comes out
okay what does that have to do with this post lol
might want to get your blood sugar tested.
"well, in my case my urine is clear as spring water and I pee the regular amount, sometimes more than usual"
Should it be a concern in this regard?
Not sure why this is getting downvoted
"I went to a urologist while I was on Vyvanse and found out that my prostate was slightly enlarged because of the medication, even though I'm in my twenties."
Stimulants like Vyvanse do this; you're likely not dehydrated since you're drinking that much water
"Vyvanse can cause dry eyes and dry mouth, along with other stimulant-like symptoms"
I recommend chapstick and eye drops.
Try electrolytes
You can buy it as powder to add to other drinks
If you pee all the time you loose salt and feel dehydrated.
There are many causes for that tho
have you tried drinking less water? It won’t kill you for a day
Improves your hydration and boosts a tonne of other minerals
Might need more electrolytes or vitamins
"Do you chug fluids or are you spacing it out throughout the day? It's also getting cooler out, dry skin can be due to dry air, too"
​
"You are probably misinterpreting the signals your body is sending you and drinking a lot of water you don't need.

If you drink too much water you can flush the salt and electrolytes out of your system which makes it hard to retain water, which makes you actually dehydrated, which makes you feel dehydrated and drink more water in a bit of a vicious cycle.

Drinking some electrolytes will not necessarily help, especially if you're still chugging water."
Read the post
Thank you! Okay and why shouldn't you drink sugar?
The post specifies Gatorade
"Gatorade is missing many of the electrolytes and/or has them in poor balances for anything other than extreme sweating situations.

Gatorade doesn't help me"
Balanced electrolytes supplements do help.
"A study conducted in 2023 showed that sugar increases ADHD symptoms 

Sugar without ADHD can really lead to impairments in cognitive function, memory and attention alone without the added complexity of ADHD"
I already don't add it in coffee but I'm curious about the science.
no i didn’t
I tried electrolytes too as I mentioned in the post

Nicotine with adderall

"maybe take the time to travel out and book ahead at a location with high pass rates?
+ 1-2 lessons a few days before"
I don’t have any tips since I’m in the same boat
"I failed twice and haven’t gone back to try again since 😭🥲 If you need, schedule two lessons or so to just boost your confidence"
Then maybe you’ll feel more comfortable going into the test
"

I do really want to get my license, but the fear of failing is holding me back unfortunately"
We got this though!
What country are you in?
I felt the same way about driving
Maybe look to take your exam somewhere else if able
Try to read reviews or ask around to try and find one with nice exam proctors
I understand the people riding with you during these tests tend to be rude though
"Otherwise, why is it that you failed the exam?"
Driving tests are really hard
You have to strategize which dmv you take it at
I just quit trying lessons
My teacher was so bad
I make one mistake and then screams five things I have to remember next time we go round a mini roundabout
Fuck sake just give me a break I’m trying
I told him about ADHD and he just went off the rails saying driving is so easy that ADHD makes no difference
I didn’t even do anything dangerous he just didn’t like the specific way I did it
I know people who don’t struggle with any issues similar to yours who have failed their driving test multiple times - despite what we are told via media it’s not as easy a task as it’s made out to be
"Also I have noticed through anecdotal evidence passing/failing can be heavily influenced by the type/personality of the examiner 

What I suggest is that if you have the $ research and see if there are any driving schools/instructors that specialize in anxious drivers - you’re be surprised at what is offered these days - and see if maybe you can get some lessons from them"
"They might be able to give you some tips and pointers that will specially address handling anxiety while driving 

Otherwise try and practice more if possible - often repetition is also a good way to quell anxiety because it breeds familiarity 

But remember you are trying and that’s what counts"
Every time you try is a win no matter the outcome!
I had to take my written 4 times……….
Better to take less risks and drive slower than what you usually do
Most people in my country fail because of too high speed
I passed my driver's exam 2 months ago
"U can DO it.!!
Just for the record, MOST people fail the first time"
"At least over here, cause we have very strict rules"
"The chances of failing are even higher the older people are.
A girl in my class took the test 5 TIMES before she passed."
"- _My god the flashbacks to my drivers license time ten years ago it's over floating my brain rn_ im so sorry that you didn't get it this time but you can try again! My friend took five turns to get her licence but in the end she did! (with severe ADHD) 

- I got a terrible route in the driver's test, it was really stressful one"
The Censor noted that she liked me talking about where I'm going and what I'm doing while driving
"For example ""I will switch lanes but before I do that I check my blindspot and mirrors.."
"oh there is road work ahead, I should slow down and watch out for workers on the road"" ""a roundabout I have to make sure to be in the right lane""  the Censor said she appreciated knowing what I'm doing at anytime, meanwhile its my way of keeping thoughts at bay lmao -

- Also I was lucky since my dad and I drove many times in that area the day before and I knew where I was going"
"


I wish you all the best, just work on the thing you failed at and you will be driving without supervision in no time ❤️"
Go in with the sole intention of just trying your best
Don’t even think beyond that
Don’t fantasize
About the freedom of driving
"Pretend that whatever happens, you don’t get to drive"
Take getting a license off the mental table
Your sole job is to drive as well as you can and then that’s it - you leave without a license
"

It’s the potential promise of driving freedom that has you nervous"
Pretend it’s not a possibility.
"I have some tips! Firstly, drive the area extensively beforehand if you can"
"If you’re very lucky you’ll even spot another driving test or an instructor teaching their student the course, and you can follow them to get an idea of where you’ll drive on the test"
"

Next, get a patient friend to drive around with you and make you talk to yourself"
This is how they teach UPS drivers to do all the extra checks they need to while driving (my husband is one)
"For example, when you pull up to a stop sign , announce everything you’re doing: “look left, look right, check blind spot, check for bikes in the rear, check crosswalk - okay all clear, it’s my turn, came to a complete stop, checking again for bikes in the bike lane, blinker on, and turning right….”

Get a friend who can help you “study” like this by prompting you when you forget to announce something"
It will also help your brain follow along with what it’s _thinking_ about doing and what it’s _actually_ doing at that moment
"You have to think about a lot of things that aren’t actually happening when taking the driving test, like visibly turning your head to check for bikes even when you know there’s not a bike there"
"Adding the vocal element gives you something to do to associate with the check, so you’ll remember to do it better"
"

Bonus points if your chosen friend can create some mild anxiety for you by acting like a driving instructor"
"It’s going to be an anxious experience, so building your ability to do every little detail while under pressure will help!

Good luck!🍀"
"I failed twice, too"
Passed on my third attempt
"Aced it, actually"
All at the same test site
"Here's the secret I figured out on my third try: prepare ahead of time.

What worked for me was taking the time to study and practice"
"That helped my confidence too: I was a little nervous, but nowhere near as much as the first two times.

You can do it! Have faith in yourself!"
It took me a few tries as well
"Don’t worry, as they say, practice makes perfect!"
"It took me 5 attempts to pass 😂 always failing for silly mistakes (turns out it was the ADHD...) I found it helpful to do an intense course that basically ended with the test, so everything was still super fresh in my mind and I was super focused on just driving"
Been driving over ten years now with very few issues (still couldn't navigate myself out of a phone booth without a satnav but I am what I am!)
"Don't sweat it, I know the fear of failure could be overwhelming, but just keep trying and you'll get it and in years time you'll tease yourself for it"
"I don't remember my actually license but I failed my class 1 license 4 times, I could drive fine with the instructor but as soon as the road test came my nerves were shot, like my first fail was because I didn't check to see if lugnuts were tight on a pretrip and before I even got behind the wheel I failed, it was ultra embarassing to me....but now looking back it's hilarious, you got this random Reddit person! Someone recommended to do a practise test the same day and I highly recommend that idea."
"Hey! I failed 5 times before I eventually passed it's ok! 

I don't know what country you're in, but in South Africa go for the truck license because it has a loophole that let's you drive a car"
"

Also, the truck test has you do less things (*easier things*) opposed to car"
And if you can park a truck you sure as heck can park a car
"

Also, don't beat yourself up"
Most systems like this are rigged to make you do over many times because money
"

You will get it when the time comes."
"This was a location with a relatively high pass rate, but I had never been in the area before and the lady was a dick to me"
Kind of the perfect storm.
It’s not even the driving for me- I feel confident driving
It’s the anxiety and my mind goes blank during the test
Best of luck to you!
The US
I just struggle with anxiety and focusing even on meds while driving so it’s a pain.
Definitely
"Down to 2 areas I could test at, but given that I didn’t know the road and the lady was an ass I just felt this wave of anxiety and nervousness and that screwed me"
"First time I should’ve passed but made a small mistake on a left, so I think I’ll go back there and pass next time."
Yeah I have a friend whose sister failed 6 times it’s honestly about finding a nice instructor and being confident.
It wasn’t a lesson
I found a lady who was super nice in lessons and I drove really well with her
It was the tester this time
Older lady who was just fucking miserable.
Thanks for the tips :) - I did find an instructor that was super nice but the lady’s personality and attitude fucked me up today
"She told me about rules which aren’t mentioned in my state’s handbook, by my driving instructors, and weren’t even mentioned by the last tester"
"I failed on one thing the first test, so it’s just working on it till I get it."
Oof that’s rough
I luckily passed that on the first try but my actual license testing has been a nightmare.
Speed has never been an issue but you have to stay within 2-3 under the speed limit or you’re penalized.
Thanks for the support :) - the lady was nice the first time second time she was a stinky ass
Just gotta get a nice instructor and be confident!
Smart
I’ll do this next time!
"Thanks for all the tips, I’ll make sure to use them and I’ll update how my next test goes!"
"I don’t know where you live and how your systems work, but the way I passed my driving test the second time around was by booking an hour long driving lesson right before it that simulates the test itself and had the driving instructor test me"
"

When I got around to the actual testing instructor, it was a bit mentally easier as it was “just another practice test”"
Have you tried beta blockers?
Yeah definitely drive around the area beforehand so that you’re comfortable and familiar with it
What mistake did you make with the left? Did you turn when the opening was too small?
Ye that’s a shame
My lessons were awful and put me off driving
The tests are so hard in England I don’t think I’ll ever bother to drive
Are you in the states or Europe ?
"Ofc, u have to maintain a flow"
But u need to drive after the weather or road conditions
"Exactly it has a lot to do with who you're driving with, good luck 🍀🤞"
That would’ve helped because I didn’t know the area at all
I failed because of my hesitancy which is also a result of being nervous and not knowing the area.
Outside turn lane and she thought I turned too tight and cut into the inside lane which I might have
"The overwhelming commonality that both testers told me (Second Lady inferred, she didn’t expressly say I don’t think she had the cognitive function to do so) is that I’m too hesitant, which is anxiety and lack of focus."
Yeah I’ve heard
The guy I had first lesson was an ass and made me cry during driving
Second Lady I found was the nicest lady ever who is open to answering question and is very motivating.
The states
TYSM!!
It sounds like she was really nit picky
That’s unlucky
"Also, don’t worry about being too hesitant"
It is safer to be hesitant than overconfident and impulsive
In real life this is only a problem for the people waiting on you
"Sure, you don’t want to selfishly inconvenience others, but ultimately you cannot worry about them"
You need to do what makes you comfortable
Eventually you will get more and more comfortable.
Well full respect to your second teacher!!!
"Ahh 
We used to go to a dmv in an upscale neighborhood because the employees were “nicer”"
"A lot of my other friends has fewer issues passing, however, my state is making it a lot harder to pass given we’re a hotspot for drunk drivers and just general misdeeds."
I went to a nice one but guess that wasn’t the case lol

Why does it still feel like a personal failure?

Hey! I'm sorry this is causing you so much frustration and I hope this thing that I do may help a little
"But it's just a band aid really, and it doesn't always work for me.

I make a 3 by 3 chart, with one axis being urgency/importance and the other being how much effort it will take me"
"Important is, not how much effort I think it *should* take, but how much it will take for *me* to do it"
"Sometimes really silly things end up in the high effort column, but that's how it be"
"

I start by doing things in the high urgency/low effort square and go from there"
"Sometimes just doing that much helps kick start me, and my brain loves crossing things off the chart"
"

My fav thing about this is I end up realizing what is actually the most important thing for me"
"If I keep putting 'fold laundry' in the low importance/high effort box and I never get to it, it helps me realize that maybe it's just not that important to me and I need to eliminate it from my things to do"
I'll hang up a few work outfits and the rest can just be wrinkly
"

This is more a system then dealing with the emotions, but also realizing that just because some chore is something 'better people' do doesn't mean I have to do it, or do it the 'right' way is really freeing."
"I sometimes struggle with the same thoughts, the key here is to avoid at all cost two things: comparison and judgement"
One thing that I say to myself when I feel like you do is “I did the best I could at that time”
"It doesn’t matter if you only did one task, what matters is that you did one task! And maybe that’s all you could do, and that’s alright, we have to go one step at a time"
"

Lists are overwhelming so maybe next time you could try making a one-thing list, something realistic that you know you will be able to complete"
And once that is done be sure to recognize your effort and then continue with other things
"If things don’t go out as planned, simply state the facts: “I didn’t do this” (avoid saying anything judgemental or subjective, simply say what happened like if you were a neutral observer)"
"And once that is out of the way, you can start analyzing what went wrong and how to fix it.

I hope this helps you, and I wish you the best <3"
"I'm currently in your boat and haven't managed to clean my room in over a week, so I get your feels"
"

I learned: Think in terms of *small* wins"
"If you can't full ass a thing, *half ass* it"
"

Only managed to do *one* thing off that list of 6? That's one less thing, it's still a success!!

Also, don't compare yourself to other people"
"You aren't them, and they aren't you"
"Your only competition is *yourself* 

Can you be slightly better than yesterday's you? And do *one more* thing than them? That's a win"

Call and speak to the pharmacist about it and see what solution they can come up with.
"I just took 4 10mg IR sandoz adderall(E111) and they didn’t do shit, no good or bad side effects"
In fact I binge ate on them
They’re pedaling us straight sugar pills now I’m 100% sure of it
"Tried name brand Shire, TEVA and mallinckdrodt, all 100% ineffective….."
thank you i did! I left a voicemail for CVS

Hope it helps!!

I don’t have any advice just commenting to say im the exact same and it sucks
"Maybe start with smaller/less complex projects? Us ADHDers have a hard time with tasks like ""start a youtube channel"" that seem simple but actually require like 100 different steps"
"So instead you could frame the project as ""make a video about x"""
"Also if you can identify what it is about that project is turning you off it might help.

For me, I got really burned out from digital stuff after the pandemic and getting a job where I'm looking at a screen all day"
"So I got into sculpting with oven bake clay so I could do something with my hands, and its worked out well.

And, delete tiktok!! I'm convinced it ruins peoples attention more than other apps."
Keep doing it every day dont slip dont take days off..force yourself and keep forcing yourself and eventually it becomes a slight habit
"

Like kid that makes there bed everyday you have to force it to make it click."
"Don’t start anything!

Kind of kidding"
This is where I am.
What helps me is to buddy up with a friend to start the project
"If there's no friend available I found writing my goals down for the next day, keeping the list in sight next to my bed and keeping my phone outside my bedroom is useful"
Not foolproof but a better start into the day for sure.
"If I were to rephrase your question it would be, ""I want to learn to love the pursuit of something meaningful and engaging that grows as I grow offering nuanced and exciting challenges regularly.""

How close is that to your intended meaning?"
"I try to look at it as a part of my life that I tend to when I can, this helps me stop shaming myself for not doing it as often as I want to which helps me stay motivated to pick it up whenever I can"
"I still struggle with picking it up often enough, but that mindset makes it feel less nerve wracking to play around with it and like less of a failure if I’m not “sticking with it” as much as I’d like to"
"

ALSO the expression “roots before fruit” has been helpful for me! Like another person said, try to look at it as making one YouTube video instead of BECOMING a YouTuber"
Try not to focus on or announce your end goal - it can make you less motivated to actually work towards it.
I don't have anything to put to your dilemma because I have the same issue
"I said to myself I'm gonna teach myself bass guitar and keyboard, I buy the items including a synthesizer, I mean I've blown a few grand in this stuff & sits there collecting dust I wanna do it I just dunno how to start"
I feel you
I've started and stopped so many hobbies and projects and have started/stopped streaming like 8 times in the past decade.
RemindMe! 2 days
"Are you medicated?

I’ve long had this problem and only recently diagnosed and medicated"
I feel like with the medication i have the mindset to stick to something
"

It’s only been a couple of weeks so i haven’t tested this theory yet so curious to hear from people with more experience"

"Any changes to medications should be discussed with your doctor, I cannot explain how much I would NOT recommend taking 60mg if you’re prescribed 30"
"

If it’s not doing enough for you then discuss it with the person that prescribed it, they can better recommend how you can increase the dose or maybe even change the medication"
"You also don’t want to raise any red flags with them for abusing these medications, they’re controlled for a reason."
"Are you taking Adderall XR by chance? I noticed that you said ""capsules"", that's why I ask"
"If so then you are on an extended release medication and the dosing is a bit complicated.

Doubling the dosage suddenly may or may not be safe, ask your doctor about that"
Regardless of what medication you are on my advice to you would be to move slowly in small increments either direction
"The correlation between effects and dosage is not necessarily linear, especially if you have a long-acting or extended release medication."
This is a question for your prescriber.
definitely talk to your doctor! there are some medications that need to be increased/decreased gradually to avoid serious side effects
"it really depends on the medication and your treatment plan.

immediate-release stimulants are really the only ADHD meds that you can adjust safely on your own within the range prescribed by your doctor"
I used to have a prescription for 20mg IR adderall that my doctor broke out into 10mg 2x a day so I could take 5-20mg/day depending on how I was feeling.
Thanks for your reply
The problem I have is that it kind of feels like it stops working after a few hours
Instead of the 8-12 they say online… I’ll def ask my doc if a higher dose means intenser effect or prolonged or both
"If it feels like it stops working too soon then you may need to take it more than once a day instead of taking more at the same time, ask your doctor about that"
"

I had a similar problem to you, raising my meds did not make it last longer at all and did not make the effects more noticeable"
"Taking a second (and now a third) dose each day helped, so did altering the spacing between them."
Yeah that’s why you wanna tell your doctor
"It’s possible to get an instant release as a booster for when they do wear off early, which is what my psych is currently discussing with me for when I move to the XR"
"Taking a higher dose won’t necessarily make it work longer and it might cause some nasty side effects too, so I’d discuss perhaps getting a booster instead."

I'm so lost and scared

It does if you’re bored !! It all boils down to this
"Idk about sitting down and eating, since I love food and eating"
"
But generally, try and keep yourself occupied… I keep myself occupied with doing laundry for example, the annoying thing I do it when I’m supposed to be working"
Set yourself a timer to sit still and get up once the timer is up maybe ? Good luck
I’m curious what other people may come up with.
Have you tried eating standing up?

Yeah I for sure experience this too
"Remember, the meds aren't a 'fix all', you will still have bad days and that's fine, it happens! Just let it out, it will pass"
"Since being medicated I notice that my bad days are much less frequent than before, but I still totally get them"
"Same as you, I become super overwhelmed over the smallest things sometimes for like no logical reason, but it happens"
"Got mad at work today, ended up accidentally breaking something"
"It was hard, and very overwhelming and I wanted to fight everyone who looked at me the wrong way"
"But I got over it, it passes."
Thank you
You have no idea how much your response means to me right now
I feel like a crazy person
"But you're right about the meds not being a fix all, and I need to remember that I still have to fight every day even if I am medicated."
"You’re not crazy at all, every human has bad days, we just happen to be a little more prone to them than some! And yeah I understand it can be difficult when you start meds and start having better days then you get smacked in the face with a bad day and it seems so much more impactful"
"But some days you don’t have to fight, you are allowed to just take it easy and do what you gotta to do look after you"
There is nothing wrong with any of that
"Sending you good vibes, I hope it gets better soon!"
Thank you so much

"It's pretty much the same for me with elvanse and tentin, but my brain has been quiet since June now 😂"
"Stressful and emotional situations can diminish their effectiveness, but on a calm, quiet day, that effect persists"
For me anyway.
Yeasirrr adderall is a life saver and changer
"Got prescribed it about 6 months ago and my mind has never been quieter, it gives me the right amount of energy and calmness"
Definitely doesn’t make me “LOCK IN” for school how some say it does
But I feel like I can just sit down and not be all mad about having to do homework
For some reason I’ve never had this quiet brain effect that a lot of people describe.
It’s a really beautiful thing to find out that all you needed to stop the chatter was medication
I remember the first day I started my medication I cried because I never knew peace from my own thoughts before.
Yes
"It’s not completely quiet, but holy shit in comparison it’s a miracle"
I also have ocd and struggle with constant rumination and the adderall helped that as well
Idk how I was functioning before
For me isn’t so much “quiet” as “more organized” which is a massive improvement either way from the utter batshit chaos it was before.
"The first day I took ADHD meds I texted a friend who takes them ""holy shit I can think one thought at a time!!!"" So yes I get the quiet sensation after it having been so busy"
My head still goes quiet on my meds 30 years later
" For some it doesn't.

The Honeymoon Period is more about how much work you're going to get done in the next few days"
 It's because the novelty of being able to just do whatever you want is pretty shocking and refreshing
 But that wears off and you'll need to learn to motivate yourself like everyone else.
"You'll develop a tolerance to stimulants, unfortunately"
My doctor recommended I only take my meds on days of work to reduce that likelihood
I wasn't for a while though
Adderall made me a lot more confident socially and helped me follow through with my work
"It still does, just not to the same extent.

I'm trying Monday through Friday now and not taking them on the weekends"
"I'm embarrassed to keep asking for a higher dosage, so I'm hoping that does the trick lol."
Adderall fixed my working memory
"It allowed me to stay ""on track"", even if I got sidetracked by something else"
"I went from getting up to get a drink and coming back to my desk 45 minutes later with no drink, to just simply getting a drink and coming right back to my desk.

The duration of the effects will diminish more quickly after taking a dose, over time"
Unfortunately.
I find it really interesting to hear about this experience because I can't relate to it at all
"Granted, I've only been on Ritalin for 3 weeks, but my inner monologue and frequently occurring simulated dialogues are still just as active"
"With that said the inner voice(s) are generally way more positive/neutral lately and not as
negative/confrontational as they used to be"
"

A common scenario I would have before treatment is when something is not going well, such as a competitive game, work or whatever project I can't start or finish, I would ruminate and loop negative conversations where I had to defend myself against imaginary slights"
I find it way easier to put those thoughts aside now when needed and they don't spiral as easily
"

It's like having a leash on your brain whereas before my brain would be a rabid rabies infected Chihuahua"
"

@OP In any case I hope your experience continues to stay positive :)"
I’ve been taking Adderall XR 20mg for about 6 months now (2-4 times a week) and in my experience there was a “honeymoon period” but after a few weeks the effects stabilized and now I still feel the focused and energized feeling but in a smoother way.
Same
I remember being scared to try it because the horror stories it had around it
It’s by far the best medication I’ve taken
It makes me feel somewhat normal
I’ve taken it for months now and it still works great
Not the euphoric feeling the first time I took it though
But it does its job.
Yayyyyy! I just started today as well
I was very anxious to take it because I have OCD and was worried it would make things worse
I felt mine kick in about 60 minutes after taking it
So much so that I turned to my 11 year old and told him excitedly that I thought it was working
I am worried I am being too hopeful but I haven't relaxed like this in a long time
I feel naturally happy
"For me, it wasn't like my mind went quiet or all of the clouds cleared"
"I feel like ""the clouds"" are thicker"
I can't focus on them but there is room around me
I can focus on now
It's spectacular
 All the best OP! Hope it's long term!!
This was also my experience
"I was scared to try it, but then I couldn't believe how mellow my brain felt—it was even more so the second time.
Full disclosure: It was my daughter's, Adderall, who takes extended-release.
I now have a diagnosis and prescription, and I take quick release"
"
After taking it every day ( I think I'm four weeks in), I still feel calmer and more clear-headed"
I can complete tasks when I think of them rather than put them off
"Overall, im just more functional, and my family can tell when it wears off because my energy is just way more spazzy (for lack of a better word)"
"
I’m 46, and I never felt less scattered-brained in my whole life"
"I can still easily lose track of time and get lost in activities im engaged in, and I am super impulsive, but I’m an artist, so that can be a benefit and a curse."
i started taking vyvanse today and feel the same
I've been on 20mg XR since 2016
I still get the quiet brain.
I'm on day two -- I was suppose to start at 5mg and work my way up as needed every 5 day but I immediately went to 10 mg today and tomorrow I might do 15mg
I dont quite feel that quiet yet and I'm anxious to get there.
"It’s been almost three months for me, and the effect is still the same"
I called it having an “empty brain”
"Like, all the thoughts I used to have to organize in there were gone"
It actually freaked me out the first day
"But now, I don’t think I’ll ever want to live without meds"
I don’t understand people who say they take breaks from their meds on weekends or non-work days…
Like WHAT?!?! I could never lol
I didn't know what true quiet was like until meds
"For me personally vyvanse is much better, my body doesn't like Adderall"
I tried both IR and ER versions of Adderall and both caused migraines and they elevated my blood pressure
"

The only thing I don't like about vyvanse is the cost even with insurance but if I don't have it I can't get anything done so I just have to deal with it"
"

But good luck with Adderall i hope it continues to work for you."
Today was my first time taking it too
"I don’t know if you got the XR but I noticed it start to wear off after 5ish hours, have you felt it start to wear off? If so how long did it take, I’m taking 10mg at the moment"
"If I didn't have a predisposition to high blood pressure due to genetics, Adderall would have worked wonders in my life in the past."
Can I ask what dose you are taking?
I would always be in the car listening to music and/or podcasts
It’s like I was scared to be alone with my thoughts
"Now I can spend an hour in quiet without 10,000 thoughts battling for my attention."
"today was my first day too!!! I totally get you, I didn’t realize I thought that much I completely thought I was normal, kinda missing my internal commentary/monologues"
"Like this is what it feels like to be bored, but agree this is so peaceful"
I was getting slightly tired though
I looked into it ans apparently it’s common and our minds are so used to being in a constant state of high alert
and Adderall introduces control to our thoughts that we usually never have that result to making our bodies feel like it’s winding down.
It can help
"You’ll also find yourself emotionally quiet, which might impact your relationships, but do what you need to do to be effective"
The people that care for you will still care
"They’ll be glad to see you doing what needs to be done, even if you become emotionally reserved"
"In many cases, it’s better than the alternative."
It was for me like this on d1 as well
Never again
It helps marginally if I take it..
15mg IR twice a day..
This is confusing and disappointing.
I just started adderall myself recently after being diagnosed with adhd at 15/16 I think? so about 5-6yrs ago and when I can actually screw my head on right and focus on tasks without being distracted/overwhelmed/sluggish which has been a game changer for me
"Not having a million random thoughts racing through my head every waking moment felt so foreign at first, despite it making my life so much easier"
"I used to 'regulate' my concentration and alertness with caffeine for so long (which with how much I was taking on a regular basis, was insane) and the adderall fixed the main problem that's bogged me down for so long so I'm here with you on that"
"I wouldn't say my head is completely quiet when I'm on it, however I can finally have a normal stream of thoughts when I'm working on tasks."
The first time I had vyvanse was like that too
I wanted to cry
i started adderall about 3 weeks ago
"the very first day i took it, after about 30-45 minutes i felt like i was a little bit high"
"then about 15 minutes after that, my head was so clear and i was much more able to focus on what i was doing"
"i took it on a day i was off work, ironically on halloween, and after it kicked in, i felt so focused and i got my whole house cleaned and reorganized and hung up pictures and a curtain rod, and i did it PROPERLY and i actually had the patience to do it properly, which has never really been a thing for me"
"now after about three weeks, i’ve noticed i can focus on my tasks a lot easier and i don’t jump from task A to task B to task C back to A then back to C and so on"
"however, i’ve noticed that if im mostly done with task A and i set something down to go help a customer, i tend to forget that i set something down and need to go put it up correctly, and just jump right in to task B"
"but overall, it’s been a great experience for me!

edit to add: i also have noticed that things don’t seem to bother me as much when i’ve taken my meds"
i also have noticed i’ve tapped more into my creative side lately than i have in the past
im not sure if that’s just a coincidence or not though
I am on methylphenidate (Ritalin) and I still have thoughts in my head
It's not dead quiet.
I started  Concerta today and had the same experience
"It was so interesting, it was calming yet scary? Also managed to stay focused without my brain being an interrupting cow (moo)"
I’ve been on Adderall for 25+ years
It’s great until it’s your last week of the script because you had some late evening things to do you take another pill and now you are short or worse your out
Getting anything done off of It for a few days is so so difficult
I would also recommend taking a day a week off of it so it affects aren’t diminished
"Good luck, happy it’s working for you."
To be completely honest
This doesn’t happen for me with my ADHD
Adderall solely gives me motivation to focus and complete tasks that take a longer period of time
That’s really it
It seems like it has the same effect on me as it does non adhd people except I just desperately need the motivation boost.
I am definitely experiencing the quiet in the brain
"However, my husband said it’s making me bitchy"
Have any of you noticed more agitation? If so does this go away? I have only taken it about 5 times in the last 4 weeks.
Yes this happens to me too! I thought my meds weren't working until the first time I went out for a walk
"My head was so quiet, it was incredible"
"

I've been on meds for a month-ish, now that I've gotten used to the meds it does feel like they're not as effective anymore, but my mornings are still very peaceful."
"First time on Vyvanse after an hour it went all quiet.

I stood up,  cleared a ton of stuff on my to-do that I've been pushing for months in some cases.

Once done I sat down, and broke down crying.

38 years, that's what I've been missing on ?"
idk abt adderall but i was on concerta for 2 years and it worked fine but it wasn’t miraculous yk
then i started vyvanse
omg
it was a fucking miracle
I can’t believe i went through 37 years of my brain being so noisy until now
 It’s a lifesaver.
Just be grateful the meds work
Sounds like you’ll really enjoy it
I had the same experience and still do
It’s fantastic.
Has meds helped with shakes i get constantly i think its from my adhd unmedicated
One of the best parts of Adderall
"I love that I can shut my brain up, until it wears off 😫"
Has anyone ever had like a noisy brain but the noise feels as if its coming from the outside of your head saying things that put you down or like trying to hurt you in anyway is this normal for adhd or is this psychosis
Good to hear
I'm liking this quiet.
Are those new drugs? I've tried a bunch with no effect but haven't heard of those.
“not be all mad” is the best way to describe what it does for me too
i wish i got more energy but the lack of irritation and anger is nice
"You and me both, maybe I'm overthinking it but idk"
Same
"I asked my psyche about it, she said she thinks it's a ADHD PI thing"
"No studies, just something she has anecdotally noticed"
"Seems like Innatentive types rarely get the clear head or ""so this is what it feels like"""
"Meds help, but no day and night difference."
Me either
"I can drive my brain on meds, though"
Rather than it driving me.
I described in another comment in this thread that for me it was like the clouds didn't clear
They got thicker and I can't focus on them
My OCD thoughts and worries are still there but I have room around me I can see
I feel I can tackle things as they come because I'm not overwhelmed by all the problems around me
"What was your experience when you started ADHD meds, if you have, and don't mind sharing!"
I was diagnosed last week and started my Concerta next morning
"Ever since, every morning, one hour after I've taken the medication the music playing in ne head has gone more quiet until I can't really have the songs in my head even when I try to catch them"
It's the same thing every day
This is the most concrete I could describe the quiet.
Same thing happened to my friend actually
I gave him adderall because I suspected he had adhd (It was wrong
I’m not a doctor my bad I know.) But he told me he couldn’t believe he’d ever feel that way
He was overjoyed
Sadly his mom doesn’t believe in mental heath and won’t take him to a doctor
He is still struggling
😔
This right here ☝🏻 Especially with tasks that generally would take half as much time to complete for the average person because I'm focusing on the details too much so it matches what my brain thinks is up to standard.
"My motivational engine Is broken, what do?"
"> You'll develop a tolerance to stimulants, unfortunately.

Only 13% of people develop an actual, physical tolerance to stimulants on the doses we take"
" For the rest, it's something else being mistaken for tolerance, like social tolerance, or not realizing how much the meds are still helping, or the honeymoon phase ending, or the meds interfering with eating enough protein to work properly."
Right ! Every time I ask for a higher dose I feel like a drug addict 😂 but I’m at 20mg now and I’m doing ok ….
"I tend to not take my meds on Sunday for both the potential tolerance effects, and for the potential med shortage preparations"
Usually Sunday is pretty chill at my house and the demands of time are not as big so if it takes all day to do something that is okay. 
I also have OCD! my psych told me it could also help with ocd and anxiety.
Don't do that unless your doctor specifically tells you to
" I'm on day 5 today of 10mg ER, and every single day has been different from the last"
 My doctor told me to give it at least a week if not two before assessing things
" It kind of tanked for me, especially on day 3 and 4 but today it has come back up in a really nice way."
"What happens when you're out of meds for 15 days before you can get it filled again? I wouldn't ask for a refill before that time, nor would I want to be completely out for 15 days"
"

Cover your bases, and give it 10 days at the prescribed dosage, message the doctor after 10 days without saying you took double or 1.5x the amount you were supposed to"
Just say you're not really noticing the effects.
Unfortunately my insurance requires that I take adderall for x amount of time before I can be prescribe vyvanse
But that is what my psych said he prefers to prescribe
"I honestly don't know which I have, it's 5mg twice a day (but my psych told me to start just once a day to see how I feel)"
I took it around 9am and started feeling it wear off around 2pm so yeah about 5 hours
Literally same
I drive with earbuds in (unsafe I know) but it's the only way I can cope
Today I didn't need anything for the first time in literally years but I did turn on the radio
"Yes, around 2pm I ""crashed"" I guess you could say and felt soooo drowsy even though I slept enough last night"
Still feeling sleepy and it's only 8:30pm haha
I'm technically supposed to take 5mg 2x daily but he told me to take it once daily for a week
"I’m not a psych, but that sounds more like schizophrenia"
You should make an appointment with a psychiatrist to go over your symptoms and get a trained professional’s diagnosis.
+1 on talking to a psychologist
That sounds very concerning
"It's very zen, especially without self depreciating thoughts"
"Everything just feels ""normal."" I suppose the honeymoon period is enjoying that along with what a doctor would call unessecery side effects, euphoria and the like"
"But sometimes I miss the chaos, and then I get stressed and then I don't miss the chaos 😂"
"Elvanse is Lis-dexamphetamine (slow release), and tentin is dexamphetamine sulphate (short release) , I'm on 70mg elvanse and 5mg tentin for the early evening when the slow release wears off a little"
Started on 30mg elvanse but worked up to 70mg
"And then I had the short release thrown in for the work week, but I usually skip them on weekends."
It's the European names for vyvanse and dextro
"I have inattentive, it was definitely a day and night thing"
I wonder if the effect is more noticeable or lasts longer in other types
"Oh yeah, I do have inattentive type"
That makes sense.
I started 20mg of adderall xr with a 10 mg afternoon dose a few months ago
"For me, it means I’m able to immerse myself in work, such that I’m actually able to get things done"
"

Before meds, I could rarely focus on anything that didn’t interest me for more than a few minutes, I used to literally do my term papers one or two days before they were due"
This semester has been the first time it hasn’t been a major issue.
A combination therapist/life coach works wonders.
"See, I thought so but I was so split"
Psychologist told me this ^ but Psychiatrist told me different
A “cognitive tolerance” makes sense though
I’ve definitely noticed the meds being more effective at random times
Thanks for clarifying this for me
😂 Dude yeah
I went up 5mg each appointment for the first few months
I’m at 20mg (XR) now though and still don’t feel like it’s enough.
Thank you! I just needed to hear that -- I am so ready to feel better but I can wait a few days.
Definitely *do not* do this
"Instead, learn to ration your medication by giving your body a break from it every few days"
You can easily recover lost days of an Rx if you don't hemorrhage your supply.
I've been back and forward to the doctors about it some days I can ignore the symptoms but on a bad day it really breaks my spirit can't leave the house and stuff due to having low self esteem because it starts as soons I open my eyes in the morning some days I have like tge energy to fight it and just ignore this but sometimes I've no got the mind power and very fatigued  I'm on elvance and venlafaxine do you think because it's an snri with a stimulant it's  making my head overactive
I’ve found the self depreciating thoughts are the last type to hang on 
Does that make sense?
How did you find increasing the dosage? I just started on 30mg and after a couple days I'm not sure it's making much difference at all anymore
Starting 40mg on Saturday.
not funny
"> I’ve definitely noticed the meds being more effective at random times.

This is why keeping a med log is important"
" Write down how much you take and when, and the times you do things that may affect your ADHD, like how much protein you eat, or how much you slept, or if you felt dehydrated or if you exercised or not"
" Keep track of your ADHD symptoms during the day.

A couple weeks of that and you'll see it's not actually random"
 You'll find the patterns
" You'll be able to pinpoint what's making your meds behave or misbehave.

For example, two patterns I noticed myself were:

1- if I'm getting increased side effects, it's because I'm dehydrated

2- if I'm getting decreased benefits, it's because I didn't eat enough protein"
"If you’re the owner of a uterus pre-menopause, that can also make a difference on effectiveness"
PMS and menstruation can make things worse.
"Absolutely!  I have the drive to constantly change things to ""maximize"" them as well"
 It's hard to ignore
" I'm using the drive to write a log of updates on how I'm feeling throughout the day, and I'm also playing with my daily coffee and tea to try to scratch the itch I have to ""tweak"" thing"
 I keep reading that focusing on protein intake is another great idea.
Depends on the doctor I suppose
Mines cool
"Yeah, that makes sense"
"I kind of self isolated when I started my meds, made it less likely others would impact my thoughts, and unfortunately, I kind of like solidarity now"
"I still meet up with close friends, but that's about it"
"My need for validation and approval has dissipated but isn't enitrely gone, and with it, the majority of self depreciating thoughts"
"Medication isn't a cure, sadly"
Most of the symptoms/traits will still hang around just be a lesser form to what they were making them easier to manage with time
"It's difficult to undo  the way you've conditioned yourself prediagnosis, and that's okay"
It still made us who we are now.😁
"What's the significance of the protein intake?

I've actually been tracking my emotions for about a month and a half and it's because of this log that my therapist suggested I get assessed for ADHD"
 I actually really like lists because they keep me organized when my brain cannot
I started a daily log of my thoughts on Adderall now that I've begun this journey.
"Sorry to be that guy, everyone keeps saying depreciating, but means to say deprecating."
"Being corrected is how I learn, so thank you 😊"

"What I can say post-transition, is that people severely underestimate how much bias is involved in the study and diagnosis process for ADHD (and really all of psychiatry)"
"A lot of the symptoms people consider biologically innate to women vs men are a result of how being raised affects the ways you’re allowed to cope, and how doctors view your symptoms"
"

Right now, I basically only show how hyperactive I am when I’m completely alone"
"As a girl there was an insane amount of pressure put on me to not fidget, so I had to learn to control that at a very early age even if it made me exhausted"
"I just had to learn to bottle that up even if it took all my focus to keep still, and my mind became hyperactive instead"
"My very obvious ADHD symptoms were completely dismissed, and I received two misdiagnoses after getting assessed"
After I passed as a cis man I went to see a doctor to get checked out again and my ADHD was recognized immediately and I got put on meds
"

Also, my symptoms did not change after nearly 6 years of hormone therapy, but my doctor’s viewed them differently and more legitimately than when I experienced them as a young girl."
Thank you for sharing your experience! I definitely agree on the severity of the bias present with ADHD diagnosis
"I suppose then it is mostly conditioning, masking and mostly a symptom of how our society sees women."

If you figure it out let me know lol
"No but in all seriousness it is maybe one of the most detrimental things in my life in terms of destroying my sleep, my overall mental health and productivity"
I’ll be scrolling and be begging myself to stop but saying five more minutes five more minutes and then it’s 236am and I’m so upset with myself for not going to bed and ruining tomorrow
Working from home makes it that much worse
"
I have paid for really expensive screen time apps that have locks and limits but I always figure out a way around them so at that point they become useless"
The only thing that has really worked for me is deleting the apps altogether
I am not allowed to have any social media on my phone
Period
I don’t operate with it in a normal way and it’s so problematic for me
And the whole adhd thing with “out of sight out of mind” has been helpful in that I don’t have a pull to redownload the apps
No TikTok no Facebook no twitter no instagram nothing
I have considered buying a dumb phone too but honestly it just seems silly to spend the money I don’t have on another phone and I’ll still need to keep my iPhone for various reasons
"
I have considered buying one of those locking safe type things but I really think I would just figure out how to get around it too"
A smartwatch is a great tool to avoid screen time
 The issue I was having is I needed to have my phone at my side to make sure to catch calls/msgs
  Now I can leave my phone on the charger far away when I need to focus.
I am currently also on a journey to severely limit my screen time
"I have made great strides, but still have a long way to go"
"A few things that really helped me:

1"
Delete apps you can live without
"For me, I deleted Instagram from my phone and only ever check it now later in the afternoon from my laptop browser usually around the time I'm eating dinner"
"I may spent 10 minutes max catching up on posts, DMs, etc and then I'm off until the next day"
Other apps like TikTok I've just deleted permanently and never looked back
"Might be harder for some people but obviously if it's not on your phone, you can't check it"
"Resist the urge to redownload.

2"
Disable notifications
I have little to no notifications that I actually allow to appear anymore
"Believe it or not, I have even disabled message notifications"
The only way I know if someone texts me is to open the messages app
"This obviously is a little drastic, and maybe a little unsafe if someone is reaching out in an emergency, but I found myself checking my messages way too freaking much and it had to be done.

3"
"At night, put your phone away on a charger far away from your bed"
This is especially helpful when you have an alarm set early in the morning as it forces you to get up
"Scrolling on your phone during bed time is detrimental for your quality of sleep and probably your mental health too.

4"
Do not under any circumstances check your phone first thing upon waking up
"Don't look at your messages, scroll through social media, anything"
"I read once somewhere that we are the most impressionable right when we wake up, so receiving bad news or anything triggering or anxiety inducing can potentially ruin our entire day, and I can really attest to this"
"When you wake up, rather than look at your phone go do something productive"
"Walk, exercise, make coffee,..anything"
"I'd say don't check your phone for at least an hour, longer if you can.

  
I hope this helps and good luck!"
Turn it off when you don’t absolutely need it
Reduce your social media accounts
Be bored on purpose for days and weeks
"

And most of all"
GET A KINDLE!!! Or any e-reader.
Keep everything powered down and out of easy reach
"Keep the batteries very low.  

 Leave your phone in your car if possible"
So you have to get up and out to get it
"Have a phone that just dials 911 if safety is a concern. 

Turn your wifi or data off. 

Have someone hide a device you do f need. "
"For sleep, it has helped me SO MUCH to charge my phone in another room or at least out of reach"
I plug my phone in and then lay in bed and read usually
Has helped me fall asleep faster and not check in the middle of the night
"

During the day I have no strategies lol lmk if you find any."
I delete the apps and then just redownload them
Though it does sometimes help briefly
I'm always selling things on Facebook marketplace so it's a lot harder to stay off it.
"Not so much a factor for me, I'm not getting any urgent messages or calls so I could totally turn off my phone"
It just feels like my brain isn't operational enough in the morning to do anything but scroll and when I try to start my day I get overwhelmed and go back to the phone / computer
It's worse on my days off because I have no urgent place to be
"I wish you could post instagram stories from a browser, it's the one thing that makes me redownload instagram, which I'm sure is by design"
I've never had social media notifications enabled
"I think #4 is the biggest thing here, I managed to do it for about a week but it's super hard to cement the habit"
I'll have to give it another shot.
"I need to do this for my phone and computer as well, I've gotten into a really bad habit of falling asleep to YouTube videos"
I used to be vigilant about this as well until I started living alone
Now my anxiety requires me to have my phone within an arms reach
Which is honestly dumb and not founded in reality because not at one time ever have i needed to use my phone during the night for safety purposes
"Actually, I find physical distance helps during the day too"
"I still check my phone too much but at least if it’s not right near my desk it’s easier to get work done or watch shows, clean, etc."
Do you scroll right when you wake up and still in bed?
I agree
#4 is a tough one…
Getting a kindle helped because I still feel like I’m getting “screen time” but it’s so so so much better before bed
"Yeah, I used to feel this but getting my anxiety under control really helped also lol"
"May be a good habit to just not have my phone on my person or beside me when I'm at home, the trouble is making habits is so hard to begin with!"
Sure do!
Might be worth a go
I think if I could start reading a book before bed it'd be the best thing really
"Yup, so with a smart watch, you can leave your phone across the room or in a different room and force yourself to wake up and the watch will allow you to get communication, set an alarm, and tell time.

The best thing you can do is find ways to keep tech away from you."
Keeping tech away from you by getting a smart watch is a wild take tbh
You can achieve the desired result with an alarm clock
A phone alarm arguably works better when it's across the room! Unless you're in a particular field / life situation where you often wake up to urgent messages I guess.
"Well, tech that you can scroll on"
 You cannot scroll on a smartwatch
 But it sounds like you are addicted and no suggestion or help is going to help unless you have willpower and desire
" Tools or tips help only when you have those.

Also, I don't have a job where I get urgent calls etc"
responding to people was always an excuse I used to keep my phone by me.
"That's all true, unfortunately for me I think before my medication kicks in and after it wears off I'm worse off than I would be without it entirely, so impulse control and willpower are a lot harder to come by."
Understandable and good luck with your battle.

"So in the zone I feel like I'm drooling, is that... normal?"

When I switched from IR to XR I also had a dose increase"
And I noticed that I felt less intense of an effect over a broader period of time
"I also didn’t feel the “drop” as harshly at the end of the day.

If you feel that the XR is too intense, definitely bring that up with your doctor, but I wouldn’t worry yet."

I took my UK diagnosis to another country when I lived there for a few months
My psychiatrist wrote a note
"I could NOT however, do it the other way around"
"Meaning, the NHS would not accept another country’s diagnosis"
"So it seems to be country specific.

Hopefully someone can advise on the UAE for you."
Following as I’m looking to move to UAE next year too
So what note does my psychiatrist have to write so i can my perscription abroad?
"So, once you are privately diagnosed (which is my understanding of your situation), your psychiatrist and GP enter into a shared care agreement, which means you will need to meet with your psychiatrist once a year in order for them to tell your GP that the NHS can prescribe your medication.

To get medicine prescribed overseas, you can ask your GP or psychiatrist to write a letter confirming you have a diagnosis"
They will know what to write
"

Whether the UAE will accept it, I don’t know"
"

A quick google says that you can try bring the medicine into the country, but you need to apply to the UAE’s ministry of health for approval and that could take months"
So I would look into that if I were you as an alternative option

"Did I write this? Lol

Start taking stimulant medications like Vyvanse or Adderall, whatever you can get because prices suck right now"
You’ll realize how good you feel for a few weeks but it won’t last forever
Take advantage of that feeling to make the necessary changes you need to get ahead
Form new habits during this time
"Work with your doctor to figure out what works best for you but believe me, taking that first step is CRUCIAL"
"Like I said, that superhuman feeling won’t last forever, but you’ll find yourself doing things without really putting much thought into it"
"It won’t MAKE you do it, it’ll just make it seem effortless when you do"
You also need to figure out what motivates you
"I’m rambling now lol I’m at work but yeah.

I was unemployed for 13 months due to major depression"
"I had to have surgery for an elbow injury, went to a mental hospital, lost all my hair (I have alopecia), and lost all motivation in life"
I found my current job which is basically just road tripping all day and test driving cars so that was enough to snap me out of unemployment
I quickly got on stimulants because I was having trouble focusing and staying awake as well as most executive functions
I started on 30mg Vyvanse and it completely changed my life
"I could think clearly, I was doing chores without thinking too much about it, I wasn’t forgetting things all the time, I felt brand new"
"I left my 5 year relationship and moved back into my parents, was leaving for work at 5am, making extra money and even started working out"
"I turned 26 so I’m no longer able to afford that medication, but at least I’m in a much better position now thanks to it.

Sorry for the essay"
Hope this helps in some way 👌
I’m the same but commenting so I can learn something
Context: I left the relationship because I wasn’t happy
I only stayed because it was convenient
It was a necessary change.

Is it normal to have discomfort in my chest / heart even on days without Elvanse/Vyvanse?

It is likely anxiety since stimulants make you more prone to anxiety/anxiety symptoms
Always tell your doctor though
Never mess around with heart related symptoms
"I was in the same boat and my doctor had me tested (EKG & blood work) just in case.

  
Edit: Also, stimulants take a couple days to completely leave your system"
It could still be affecting you.

No need to be a hero! Take the early fill your doctor was offering.
"When I was prescribed amp salts, I was strongly advised to keep my medication hidden and not to tell anyone I had it, if I brought it somewhere I should always have eyes on it and keep it hidden"
"

If stolen I have to file a police report to get a refill, it's less about them investigating it and more about documentation it was stolen or lost (versus trafficked) plus a bunch of insurance bullshit, a controlled substance refilled too early is a massive red flag and it's likely they won't cover it"
"Falsifying a police report is a felony, so it's a crime-deterring headache."
Here’s the thing with Schedule II drugs- it’s your legal responsibility to secure them
It’s DUMB but it’s true
"

Being in your purse and leaving your purse isn’t securing them"
Having them in a locked med bag in your purse is securing them
"

They’ll take a report and shame you for leaving a controlled substance out in the open"
They give you a tongue lashing about your responsibility
They’ll do fuck all for ab investigation bc unsecured Shed II meds are always going to get stolen
They’re long gone and they can’t prove a thing at this point
It’s classic victim blaming and they won’t believe you anyway bc they think you’re a junkie
"

What you can do is inform HR that meds were stolen from your purse at work and it’s negatively impacted your performance"
Maybe you’ll get an extension
"You’ll probably get in trouble for not bringing it up before bc what exactly do you expect them to do? 

I think you’re going to have to take the hit on this one"
Or just call your doc and ask for that lower dose rx they offered weeks ago.
theft of controlled substance
"Speak to HR, tell them that you will be reporting this to the police."
"Any ideas as to why your purse was targeted? Was anything else missing besides the two dozen or so pills?

I’m attempting to put myself in the mindset of someone who has made the decision to steal from you by taking something from your purse"
"I’ve already decided that I’m going to risk employment consequences and potentially legal ones, so why only take 30% of the bottle when it’s more efficient and less suspicious to take the whole thing?

Were people aware at work that you take ADHD meds?"
"If I’m going away for a week, I’m taking 7 pills in a separate bottle…"
take the help from your doctor and try to figure out how to make the best of the rest of the month
"reporting it to anyone would be a massive headache that in the worst case scenario could end up with you getting in trouble, and even in the best case scenario you’re never getting your pills back"
they are gone
"

anecdotally, this happened to me once and it turned out that the missing pills weren’t stolen from my bottle, but they were stolen by someone at the pharmacy and my ditzy ass didn’t notice until i got down to just a few pills left in the bottle when there should have been another two weeks"
"
didnt figure out what happened until a bunch of other people started having the same issue."
"Are you sure you didn’t fill a pill case with them or put some in another bottle? Was the top of the bottle on correctly? Did they fall out?

Were other things missing? From other people?

Unless people know you have ADHD and have meds seems very weird that they just took that"
"I think it’s more likely you dropped them, they fell out, you or the pharmacy miscounted or you put some in another container/pill case and forgot."
I wouldn't call the police
All that would do is cause a big mess at work
They would talk to your boss and coworkers..
maybe a dozen of them
 The investigation would not lead to them successfully solving the crime
 All it will do is make your diagnosis known to a shitload of people
 Just chalk up the situation as a learning experience and do everything you can to prevent it from happening again
 Oh..
one more thing..
the police don't follow HIPAA or have similar rules
 There's nothing that can stop them from speaking openly about your diagnosis with others.
Sounds like KPMG lake house lmao
"First, I'd report this theft to your boss and the police, especially if your medication is a controlled substance"
"

I understand you don't want your work knowing about this, but this is very serious and whioever stole them will do it again given the chance."
"I would let HR know that prescription medication was stolen from your purse, send an email to everyone, let them know you know it happened"
"You don’t have to let HR know what medication was stolen, the fact that it was is enough"
Tell them you are letting them know so that hopefully this won’t happen to other people in the future.
"If you think it was a coworker that took the pills, then be aware that will come back for more"
Secure your belongings-always.
"Take the L and move on, it's a learning experience.

I have to take multiple medications at work each day"
As a precaution against theft or any other issues I keep no more than enough for the day and the following day on hand
"It stays in a sealed pill container affixed to my car keys so that it's always on my person, if for some reason that's not an option then it stays locked in my locker in the break room"
"

Don't take anything with you into the workplace that you're not willing to risk other people using, breaking, or stealing from you."
I personally wouldn’t report because I doubt much would/could be done
" It does suck though, but a lesson learned"
"I had my medication in a checked bag once when flying, realized once arrived at my destination over half my script had been stolen"
I never ever put medication in a checked bag again and kept it only on my person/in my carryon.
I’m wondering if this is a bot/fake post to generate discussion
This sounds very far-fetched
And the poster has no other posts or comments despite joining in December 2023
I don’t see a way to block others from seeing your post history
" Also have not replied to any of these comments.

 OP, if this is not fake, please update us!!!"
What I would probably do. 
I dunno
I think it’s everyone else’s legal responsibility to not steal
"

If you forget to lock your car and someone steals it, it’s still their fault for stealing it"
They’re still the thief.
"One time I lost my wallet (probably stolen, because credit cards were used)"
"I had paper Adderall prescriptions in it, because that’s how I used to store them when we had paper prescriptions"
"(Except for this one time, it worked fine.) When I called the police to report the stolen wallet, officer was like, “Oh you should tell the doctor, because they could try to fill it.” I’m thinking, “no sh*t Sherlock.” I told the doctor at my next appt a few days later"
"But it’s not like they could call every pharmacy and tell them to be on the look out.  I got replacements scripts, I think"
I don’t think the doctor did anything
The possibly medicated thief was never caught. 
Or I dunno we could teach people that criminal behavior is wrong
Why was the thief in her purse at all? Why do we always put all the onus on people to not be victims? Everyone can’t walk around trying to avoid being a victim of a crime all the time.
"It's up to the person who they're prescribed to, to make sure they're in a secure place"
It's a class B drug
"I know it's still theft, but the owner will also get in trouble for this if reported."
I actually don’t think they would conduct an investigation like this.
"they would probably take your report, and you could have a copy to take to the pharmacy to get your script early."
"I don’t think they would have to, or you would have to, report it to your work."
I would maybe leave out that it was meds in the email just say something of value was stolen.
"The law is weird, if you put laxatives in your own food and someone steals it and gets hospitalized, you’re liable"
Fuckin wild.
"This is true, and if caught the thief will still face legal charges"
"Nothing about that changes; however, there is an _additional_ legal consideration added by the controlled substance.

By filling this prescription you are legally taking on the responsibility - and liability - of storing that medication responsibly"
You gotta do that
"

For example, let’s remove the criminality from the thief"
Say your medication was stolen by your 4yo niece
There’s no criminal theft here - she’s 4 - but now she’s swallowed half a bottle of adderall and is in the ER
"If you had your medication properly protected, she wouldn’t have been able to access them, so her _ability_ to access is your liability"
"Now, if your sibling had snuck into your medication and hacked into your locked med box, then handed the bottle to her daughter to chug, that’s no longer your responsibility - you stored it correctly and took reasonable precautions."
sure that’s what makes sense but that is not how the law works with controlled substances
I think we already do teach them that..
unfortunately some people don't give a flying monkey
What schedule drugs are you on? Cuz that’s delusional
That's because of intent
You were aware someone would steal your food
You also probably wouldn't eat that food with that amount of laxatives
So you've essentially booby trapped the food with the intention of causing harm to someone else
"And that's what the courts care about more than the act of stealing food because the damage that can come out of booby trapped food, far outweighs the damage of a stolen lunch (at least in the eyes of the law).

So the solution..."
Booby trap your food just enough for you to also tolerate if you ate it yourself
If you like spicy food..
Make it as spicy as you can handle
And avoid laxatives but apparently sugar free candy can have the same effect as a laxative if you eat too many.
In the USA or?
In the USA or?
"This is Reddit’s favorite revenge story (don’t know if anyone actually does it), but it is 100% illegal and pretty much constitutes as poisoning lol"
Interesting.
thanks for that last part.
Malitol-v cocktail!
Ooh yes I was speaking on US law specifically
"

Sorry to be US centric, I thought the drug schedule terminology was specific to the US until this very moment, so I was responding from that perspective"
Turns out it’s the terminology used all over! I learn something new every day!
"yes USA, sorry for not specifying"
Only if they can prove the food is basically inedible or specifically laced with an allergen knowingly
"But if it's just a type of food that you like but the other person doesn't or can't ""handle"", then you can't prove in a court of law that the food had any intention to cause harm."
WOW YOUR PFP WAS BASICALLY FULL SCREEN ON MY NOTIFICATIONS 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Also since this is a story about adhd meds being stolen
"Your honor, one of the side effects of my medication is constipation, I put just enough laxative in my food for my body to use it without putting me on toilet all day! How was I supposed to know it was going to be stolen and eaten!"

My primary care doctor is no help.

I've been panicking about this
Vyvanse is extremely difficult to find in-store and you can't call around to find it
And I'll have to switch from 90 to 30 days
I can't spend hours every month trying to find a medication
I don't understand how they're allowed to just end a service and force me to continue being a member
I would have signed up for my wife's insurance if I'd known they were going to do this.
I did submit a grievance to: blueshieldca.com/grievance
They have a surprisingly simple online form that has a free-text field
You just need to login to the Blue Shield of CA account and keep checking for updates
"Then, there's ""The Department of Managed Health Care,"" at dmhc.ca.gov, which oversees Blue Shield of CA specifically (within the state of California, there's a couple of ""insurance commissioners"" and this is the one for Blue Shield of CA)"
"If my grievance response isn't satisfactory, then I'm going to file an online grievance report with the insurance commissioner and include the difficulty of finding prescriptions and also the fact that 90 day prescriptions will no longer be an option covered under insurance for schedule 2 controlled substances with Amazon Pharmacy being the mail-order pharmacy and Blue Shield of CA requiring that prescriptions written for 90 days need to go through their mail order pharmacy"
"I hope you consider taking these steps too! The only upside is that right now, Amazon Pharmacy is willing to fill at least 30 day prescriptions of schedule 3 and 4 controlled substances (of course 90 is ideal), so that might lend itself to flexibility"
"I've seen policies be changed, so let's do it!"

"> adderall isn’t supposed to make people with adhd want to work

Huh? Then what else do they have you taking adderall for? 

Feeling tired after you take your medicine can be a sign that you do have adhd as your brain is finally slowing down from the meds"
However everyone will react differently
Stimulants make me jittery so I take Wellbutrin+strattera.
"Also I will add i used to get frustrated and ""overstimulated"" so easy at work and that's just about gone completely"
"The first month of adderall i was zoned out, kinda like zanax"
 Then i just felt normal when i took it and bad when i didn't
 So you probably needed it and your life will be much easier
Congratz.
I used to get my best workouts when I was on adderall IR
Whoever told you that probably doesn’t workout in the first place.
"Thank you for the reply It makes me feel better 

The slowing down part makes a lot of sense weirdly enough my handwriting went from horrible to legible because I don't try to write as fast as I was thinking anymore"

I’ve heard your body has to adjust to them
I’m almost a year in on Wellbutrin and 3 weeks on strattera
I exhibited the same side effects and even worse ones now on strattera
The Wellbutrin side effects went away after the second month
I’m hoping the side effects for strattera do too.

im on my second week of the medication but he started me on 10mg and i think i need higher dose
 I do like it because it doesn't make me feel like im on speed and a hard crash which was what adderall was giving me
 I like it so far because it makes me focus.

I had horrible side effects from Straterra
Have no ED with atomoxetine
How do you know that atomoxetine will be bad for you
You are hating on the doc for making decisions based on your actual conditions and reducing risk
"

Or maybe he is a part of a big conspiracy that wants to see you suffer.

One of the two."
About 3 weeks in on Strattera and I agree the side effects are rough
The positive is that this medicine works really well for me
I’m hoping the effects will go away with time.
My kid (16M) has just started on Straterra - what side effects should I be watching for? He’s grumpy and not very articulate about it
"My genitals shrunk and its was kinda painful, lost all libido, difficulty urinating, super tired all the time"
If I was 16 and put on straterra I would be grumpy as well
I think libido is a big one for most males especially going through puberty
Im on adderrall now and it’s way better for me.
"For me it’s been nausea, dizziness, no appetite, trouble urinating, and random testicular pain that can last for hours."
Well damn
Going to book a follow up with his GP - thanks for the insight - this is definitely not what I was expecting!
Ugh
We’ve def hit the nausea stage and I’ll try to casually mention the random testicular pain and not freak him out
"🫤
I appreciate when people share this because it helps us parents dig a little bit more when they responded with “I dunno” to everything"

I’m in the same boat as you
I had terrible and chaotic jobs in the dozens from teens to early 30s
They were all expendable
I managed to finish college and land a respectable professional job
"It’s the best job I’ve ever had, which is to say it’s the job I’ve hated the least"
I’m annoyed daily and find it dreadfully uninspiring and numbing
The money is fair
"

It’s not ideal, but I cope by just swallowing the hard truth that I’m likely stuck here"
I mask annoyance and rely on CBT skills and a stimulant mostly
"I promoted up also, which really helps"
I take on extra easy duties for free which builds good will
It never fixes my dissatisfaction but it’s a bandage until the next week
"Overall though, I’m fortunate and happy to have benefits, retirement, and a little money for travel"
The trade off is worth it to me now but it wasn’t easy to accept this is my peak in career perhaps.
"I immediately have such a hard time once I’ve learnt all the essential things about a job, they becoming so numbingly boring - especially if I can’t justify them having a greater purpose, like
I’m not wasting my life away basically"
"

Personally I have two part time/ 0 hour jobs, they’re not the most exciting jobs but I can work less / when I choose, so I feel I have autonomy, and they are fairly different.
One is quite physical and is back of house in a kitchen and the other involves admin and customer service etc at a museum 

Maybe I’ve just had shit jobs, but I can’t stand the idea of one full time job even in my ideal career field, sounds soooo boring"

ADHD boredom is totally real
I went from being overstimulated working very busy emergency department to working in a very slow pace detox center and being bored out of my mind
You have every right to work wherever you want and to do what makes you happy
If that is law school then you should totally go for it
Just to forewarn you though I did study for the LSAT and it requires a lot of energy and focus! The reading comprehension was the hardest part for me because the articles were very boring and I would constantly have to re-read sections because I forgot what they said
I hope you do well though! Good luck 👍
"Honestly, I feel you"
During COVID I had a job checking if people entering a building were vaccinated and got placed in a really slow exit..
"It was torture, I just had to sit there for hours so booored"
"And whenever I complained ppl didnt get it, they thought I was lucky for getting paid to do nothing haha"
Thank you!! I feel like for ADHD we need a fast environment to keep our mind racing so we don’t wander off
And thank you!! Did you study for it all by yourself or did you have a group? I know there’s one like Varsity Tutors or something.
I studied by myself
"I used Khan Academy, the Powerscore books, the official LSAT super prep and official LSAT prep tests to study"
I also found a group to study with online on reddit
I did lots of practice tests online too
I went from a 138 to a 167 and I was ready to write the test but I decided that being a lawyer was not the right career path for me 😅 Being in a court room and having to remember what people say and also having to write letters and stuff just did not seem interesting to me
I'm thinking of going to med school to become an emergency doctor
I actually preferred being in the emergency department more than anything and I feel like I'd do better now that I'm medicated.

ADHD not Lifelong?

"ADHD is, in fact, life long"
It's a neurobiological disorder
"

It was previously believed that it ""goes away"" in adulthood because people learned how to mask better and found/built accommodations for themselves to function"
" 
  
Long-term stimulant therapy in ADHD is generally well tolerated and while there is some drop-off in efficacy (sometimes in the short run, sometimes over a longer period of time) - I've yet to see research that actually advocates for 3 weeks on 1 week off, or only taking durin the week"
"Some people choose to do this, but I'd love to see published research if it exists"
"

IMO I want to be able to function in my personal time just as much as I do during my working hours, so the idea of not medicating on saturday and sunday is just fucking dumb to me"
"Also, the idea of just saying 1 working week a month is just fucked because I won't be medicated is also not a great plan"
"

  
This would warrant a chat with the doctor if you otherwise like them - they're likely going off of the information they were taught back when they were going through school"
"

If you aren't fond of them or aren't attached, yeah find a new doc who actually understands ADHD."
Ask for clarification first
Maybe the doctor just worded it badly
"Like he/she meant to say something like ""ADHD symptoms change as you age..."" rather than implying it can just magically go away.

If that doesn't clear things up, though, find a new doctor."
"I feel like this doc is super old school, I remember when I was diagnosed in the late ‘80s and going into the ‘90s I was told I would grow out of it when I got older"
"News flash, I didn’t"
If they can’t clarify to something more rational I would definitely find a new doctor
That kind of thinking is really detrimental.
My oldest kid was diagnosed way back around 1992 and the psychiatrist then said he could grow out of it
He has not grown out of it
I was diagnosed last year at 55 and I'm sure it's been an issue my whole life so I haven't grown out of it
"I suspect this is just old school thinking.

When that kid was on Ritalin, his doctor suggested taking breaks like weekends and during the summer, not to make the meds more effective, but to give him a break from the side effects of decreased appetite and headaches"
"On the flip side, my prescriber told me I should take Vyvanse every day for it to be most effective (I'm not on it anymore)"
"

If this doctor is older, I'd suspect he's stuck in outdated thinking."
ADHD is a lifelong condition
" Find a new psychiatrist.

Ask your regular doctor for an in-network referral to an ADHD diagnostician"
 A new assessment wouldn't hurt
 Have the results sent to your regular doctor and get your ADHD medicine prescription from him/her.
Re: not lifelong
This is an outdated assumption because many boys had improved symptoms in adulthood
"Usually it was because they married and their partner solved for their executive dysfunction.

Re: stimulants, the thought is you will build tolerance over time"
"However being unmedicated also increases your odds of car accidents and injury, among other things - your symptoms stop being addressed medically"
I choose not to medicate every day purely because stimulants are so heavily regulated and I like having a small buffer in case there is a local outage.
ADHD is lifelong
"Like rockpaperscissors67 said, it’s a common old school thought that ADHD magically goes away when you get older"
This is not the case
"If I had to guess, this old school thought is because older ADHD people have more experience masking or are more used to surviving in society."
"There was data I learned when I was studying adhd that supported the theory is that starting medication during a window of development actually stimulated brain development that had been lagging in some people, hence the phenomenon of 'growing out of adhd' in young adulthood"
"We were told that was in a small portion of those studied, not the norm."
Find a new doctor
"It doesn't go away, ever"
You may end up taking medication forever
It is likely to be a stimulant
Did I mention that it doesn't go away? It doesn't
"Some may assume it does, but that is because it has not been studied as much when it comes to adults"
It didn't just come back
you just figured out or self-adjusted based on how much your life was throwing at you
I have been on stimulants for 35 years
Cheers.
For fuck's sake
There needs to be sort of accountability system for these quacks
One is too many.
"It's a born deficit, did your doctor cheat on the exam"
"I’ve been waiting around 40 years for my immune system to kick the ADHD out
 /s"
It is lifelong
Find a new doctor
"This is like when people say, ""no one had peanut allergies when I was growing up!"" Yea, cuz people with peanut allergies died"
"Adults with ADHD hide it, learn coping mechanisms, and adults and children are different"
An adults impulsivity issue is different than a child's and may not look like impulsivity at first glance
"

Can someone reach a point that they can now function without medication? Yes, of course, but that doesn't mean they don't have ADHD"
"I can read without my glasses, but my eye problems don't go away when I take them off."
I was outright told by my psychologist yesterday that you can only skip days of being medicated with certain types of ADHD medications
The specific brand I am on now he warned me if it is not taken daily that it can cause negative side effects including depression
"

Also the whole skipping days thing doesn't work for everyone."
ADHD is a nuerodevelopmental disorder just like autism but there are significant differences and some overlap
"Let's talk about the ""D"" in ADHD"
"(Quick reminder, I'm a layperson"
"Go confirm what I'm saying).

As I understand it, we call it a disorder because of the impact that it has on many different pillars of our lives"
"Strip away the baggage that comes with the word, and really, we are just talking about your ability to function in your society despite the difficulties that your brain places in the way"
It's a word that is best applied blamelessly
"

To abuse the language, if someone is not dramatically impacted by their symptoms without some form of intervention, then they might have trouble convincing their doc their condition crosses into the threshold of ""disorder"""
"What if it only affects a single pillar? Is it just an Attention Decificit/Hyperactivity ""Problem""?

So can you be ""cured"" if your natural condition no longer requires intervention to be managed? It seems like there is some room for debate among professionals"
We will expect new research to converge on a treatment standard over time
"So if this is true, then nearly all doctors should agree as the research spreads.

For the time being, don't hesitate to shop around for another reputable professional"
There is nothing saying that you have to be the guinea pig for treatment progress
"This information gets refined over time, and sometimes, we realize that our new assumptions were wrong"
You can simply migrate later if a good mental health professional is still willing to take responsibility for your care.
"It’s 100% lifelong

5 out of 7 days has worked for me though"
"ADHD is lifelong, like others mentioned, and I'm curious about how much conceptions about ""growing out of it"" relate to misdiagnoses of ADHD in kids who then don't show the same symptoms in adulthood"
"This is just a hypothesis, but I know that a lot of different things can cause similar behaviors in children, so that might be part of the misconception? Either way, we're in it for the long haul 🫡"
"So, the disorder doesn’t go away obviously, but doctors characterize it based on diagnostic criteria, and people can sometimes fall out of the diagnostic thresholds due to life situation changes, changes in symptoms etc"
"however, if a dr says this means you no longer “have adhd” they are misunderstanding the diagnostic criteria anyway, since it’s technically based on the symptoms you experienced in early childhood, which won’t change without a Time Machine."
That is insane
This is bullshit.
"I assure you living with my mother and grandfather, it is life long and it is hereditary"
"I'm also convinced it compounds, if you get it from both sides of the family"
"I don't have any evidence for that, just a personal hypothesis."
">while stimulants are commonly taken on a daily basis, the evidence suggests they are most effective over the long term when taken for only a portion of the days of the week or weeks in a month (eg, 5 out of 7 days of the week, 3 out of 4 weeks of the month)"
"I can share more about this with you at our next visit”

The evidence actually says the opposite of that."
"I heard that the frontal lobe develops all the way into your 30s, so some people see a reduction or elimination of their simptoms by that age, but only some of them."
This is a lie created to help the doctor not treat anyone that requires scheduled drugs
"End of story, no debate to be had"
Leave before they make sure you can never get pharmaceutical meds that actually work ever again
Having someone undiagnose you is NOT good for your medical records and ability to get help in the future
You need to never go back to them.
This is definitely lifelong
Its a neuro/psych disorder
The reason behind being on and off the stimulants is so you don't develop a resistance to them!
"So, what am I doing here again? Or does this finally ease around 80 years of age?"
"Your psychiatrist is sounding dogmatic (religious)...unless you misunderstood? If that was the exact statement,  find a new one asap"
Newer research actually does show that ADHD medication has the potential to normalize brain function to some degree
"Changes that seem to stick, even after discontinuation of meds.

It’s not uncommon to reassess every couple years."
"In children developmental delays or simply being one of the youngest in a class among other things can lead to a misdiagnosis of ADHD, so it looks like some kids grow out of it"
"

Real ADHD is a lifelong condition but not only do misdiagnoses happen, it can also change over time and some people with mild symptoms who were just above the threshold for getting diagnosed may learn coping strategies and then may not meet the diagnostic criteria when being tested again later."
I can attest to changes over time originally diagnosed with combined type ADHD moderate at 5 1/2 years old
When I got my autism diagnosis from the The psychologist at 31 years old on my diagnostic paperwork my ADHD got downgraded to primarily inattentive type mild interesting
It’s like Tourette’s syndrome in terms of it’s not something that can go away if it’s in fact part of you
"

New dr time! Vet the next candidates by experience for who you want your dr to be! You got this fam."
Your doctor is incorrect
You don't magically recover from a neurological disorder
"Get a new doctor, and get a psychiatrist to treat your ADHD, not a GP"
GOs are not qualified to make these kinds of calls.
Psychiatrists are a shot in the dark so much for me lately
Impossible to find a good one and the ones that are bad are traumatizingly bad
If you have the mental fortitude to find a new one then good on you!!..
"anyways I have been told that in the way they meant that brain chemistry can change so severity can fluctuate as you age, but I don't get a good vibe from the way you say your doctor said it wasn't life long"
But maybe they meant it in the way I've been told
"Also I've heard taking medication intermediately works but in the sense that medication is expensive and some days one can afford to space out and stare at the wall for a full day, although I was recommended not to because my emotions and adhd are very tied."
55 here and just got rediagnosed a month ago
Its literally saved my career and lifestyle
Ive doubled my dose and never been more astute and productive
(15mg a day in the 90's to 30 mg now)
 If i retire i may reconsider but i have come to terms with this being til death do us part...
My psychiatrist (who specializes in ADHD treatment) has never told me anything like this
ADHD is undoubtedly lifelong.
"It is lifelong and it gets worst, what happens is that it gets masked by just simply getting old therefore, you are perceived as forgetful, have lack of concentration, and the list goes on ☹️."
 It’s absolutely lifelong
"

Some aspects of it get easier as you get older and tired, but then all new aspects of it get worse! Especially for women going through menopause."
"It is lifelong, no two ways about it."
I was told at 42 that I was “ too old” for my adderall prescription🤣🤣🤣
"This was after getting a dx @29/30, and medicated for 12 years …  long story short, here I am at 45 with ADHD! It didn’t go away, and yes it has gotten worse during perimenopause"
"Thankfully I have a new prescriber, after a little over 2 years without meds."
Sounds to me like the doctor doesn’t believe in medical science
"

“Contrary to popular belief, however, ADHD is often not lifelong, and so we reevaluate symptoms every 1-2 years”

I would ask them to show who wrote that…
when did they write it…
And what is the medical or psychiatric or psychological calculus that they use to come up with that?

Then I would call up either medical board and take them to task for that unscientific & improper rule that is unfair to people with ADHD"
"

If you talk to them again, tell them A 53 year old of living with ADHD, would like to know when it’s going to go away?"
"For some people the symptoms lessen as they age - for others (women in menopause comes to mind), they increase dramatically"
Take [this](https://neuronewsinternational.com/rsna-2022-adhd-migraine-covid-19/) study in and ask for their revised opinion.
"It is lifelong but, I will say re-evaluation does make sense to some extent"
"Like, i recently got diagnosed with ocd (which made me question being diagnosed with adhd and autism as a kid) and I was spiraling a little bit about having something new or whether what I’ve known about myself this whole time has been a lie"
"Anyway, my therapist at the time told me “it’s always a best working theory, and while it doesn’t negate the past, it can lead to a better answer which leads to better help”"
"So, while adhd is absolutely lifelong, you may find later in life that it wasn’t what you were struggling with"
"

That being said, I was freaking out about nothing and your psychiatrist is either bad at how they explain things or a giant red flag."
Sure if you get physical brain surgery
Or a concussion
You may have a chance to get rid of ADHD.
ADHD doesn’t just go away unfortunately
Often times we just develop systems and learn to navigate life with it
"

As far as taking time off is concerned, I think a whole week at once is a bit excessive"
My provider encouraged me to take a day off when I could to give myself a break
"I usually try to give myself 2 days each week, but this can ebb and flow depending on my work load and what I have going on at home."
I think part of what may drive this is that ADHD symptoms aren't only limited to ADHD? Other stuff can cause the same symptoms and look much the same as ADHD
"That's why for a diagnosis of ADHD, they look at your childhood and early development.

But yeah"
ADHD going away is a misunderstanding.
"ADHD is not something you grow out of, it changes with age, to better or worse"
"i was severe case as a child and was put on medication by the age of 4, today i have a house, i am more productive than my colleguas and have girlfriend and a baby on my way at the age of 26"
"what changed is that i live my life in an organised way, i know exactly what i am supposed to do at any given time, and i know my strength and limit, and have sucessfully been able to get my shit together at my current age"
This is bullshit - evidence shows that people with ADHD have physically different brains compared to people without ADHD
"[There's a great playlist on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhbAK1pdPM&list=PLzBixSjmbc8eFl6UX5_wWGP8i0mAs-cvY) from one of the world's leading experts and he lays it all out.

edit: I should mention, he isn't just some influencer, he cites his sources throughout the presentation."
I’d take a good long stare at my doctor if he ever said some shit like that
"

Queue curb your enthusiasm staredown"
"At 62,  I no longer have the energy to be hyperactive"
 
 .
I believe the symptoms of ADHD is attributed to a developmental delay in parts of brain
Eventually the brain develops and catches up to people around them around ages 40-45
"However without behavior therapy, people can develop long term habits and behaviors that echo the behaviors with ADHD even if the brain has developed"
So ADHD does go away but can still have a long lasting impact on behavior.
My brother definitely grew out of it a bit
No longer as hyperactive as he was and he was VERY hyperactive as a kid
I always appreciate when others mention that skipping meds at any regular interval seems like a stupid suggestion
"

I was finally diagnosed as an adult earlier this year and started medication within the last few months"
"When my psych mentioned that some people take the weekends off, it just did not compute"
"Sure, the meds help with work, but they also help with, idk, my life in general? 

It makes me feel like some people are seeking a diagnosis and/or treatment simply to perform better at school or work, and it really rubs me the wrong way."
"IMO any drop in efficacy that I’ve seen has mostly been tied to a lack of exercise, sleep, diet"
This is just personal experience
"To add to this, my clinician mentioned that it’s just better in general to take the same medication daily"
Otherwise you’re more likely to get side-effects as a result of constantly changing dosage.
"My previous psychiatrist believed the old ""take weekends off"" thing and the withdrawal about killed me, so I started taking it every day"
Like..
"do I not need to function on the weekend? New psych actually told me it's detrimental not to take it regularly (which I'd already realized) and encouraged me to stop the ""med breaks.""

I've now been taking my adderall without these breaks for almost 3 years and it's more effective rather than less."
I weave in and out with my meds and it works for me
"However, it’s the dosage I change, I don’t skip them"
"My psychiatrist leads the way, I just follow the advice"
A friends lad who is 12 has the weekends off and that works well for him
"It may well be down to individually how we use them, I think it’s ok to change your dose - or not."
Do symptoms change over the years?
"He should run for the hills, not clear it up"
This person is definitely going to try to tell them it’s depression or next appointment will be “let’s switch to SSRI for adhd” it’s 100% about avoiding prescribing the go-to meds for the disease.
"I agree, definitely detrimental"
"I'm surprised that psychiatrists don't have to take refresher courses as new scientific information becomes accepted/adopted.

It doesn't seem like this particular psychiatrist has the knowledge necessary to help you manage your ADHD symptoms.

If your insurance is covering it, it doesn't hurt to go back and clarify, but if it's something you're paying for out of pocket, it might be more cost-effective and validating to find someone who is knowledgeable regarding current practices."
True
"However, there have been studies that show that taking stimulant medications during development or for a while positively alters the brain"
Because of this many are able to use a smaller dose or even go off completely without being symptomatic
"Obviously, that's not necessarily true of everyone, but I wanted to throw that out there to say that there is hope"
I think dr
Tracy Marks on YouTube also explained this
"Of course this doesn’t mean it’s not lifelong, there’s just a chance to get it worked out this way"
"True, but not everyone necessarily needs to stay on medication for life"
"Symptoms can also change as you age because your brain is plastic, especially the developing brain"
Studies have shown that continued medication therapy while the brain is developing can lead to med doses not needing to be as high or no longer needed at all.
Peanut allergies have actually increased substantially independently of the increase in awareness and diagnosis
Last I looked into it the reasons for the increase are unclear
"Ironically, peanut allergies CAN go away as you get older!"
"Some ADHD medications are antidepressants, and absolutely must be taken every day"
For stimulant medications it's ok to skip days (but ridiculous to tell someone they have to do it - we have ADHD every day)
If they need to be taken daily there will be a big warning on the information leaflet that says this.
I'd also add that it depends on life circumstances
"I raw-dogged ADHD for almost 40 years, until I started running my own business from home, and suddenly all my coping mechanisms stopped working and my symptoms reached the threshold for a ""disorder"" (enough that I went in search of answers anyway)"
"

I can imagine that in other circumstances my symptoms could be considered sub-clinical (considering it's a disorder that is diagnosed through self reporting challenges, and if you have structures that prevent those challenges then you don't meet diagnostic criteria anymore despite still having the same brain).

The idea of re diagnosing to see if the symptoms still meet ""disordered"" levels is an interesting one, but it would be pretty hard to do, unless you make people come off their medication for long enough to see whether or not their lives fall apart - which seems like it wouldn't pass the ethics test."
No longer physically hyperactive
But hyperactivity can be internal as well
"If he has racing thoughts, for example, he's still hyperactive."
"It's not a 'stupid' suggestion, but it is rather stupid if it is suggested as 'you MUST do this' type thing"
"My psych actually said the same, to avoid building a tolerance and having to change doses too quickly, try to take any days off the meds that I am not working"
"

I tried it, was absolutely shit, do not like it at all"
"It's like I've been hit by a truck and all I can do is lay there all day by day 2, can't even move"
"And when I only get a day or 2 off a week, I kinda need those meds to take care of things in my personal life, I'm not just medicating to be good for work, as you said, then forget the rest of my life"
I agreed to start the meds because I need to sort out my WHOLE life
"

Fortunately when I went back and told him this he said he understood, it doesn't work for everyone, and suggested to just try and have a day off here and there when I can afford to just sit around doing nothing"
"He didn't enforce it, he didn't make me think I was relying too much on the meds"
"So on the odd occasion I won't take them, if I literally just don't want to do much all day"
"Some days I meet in the middle and only take my first dose, which I personally think works best for me, it stops me from hitting that wall but I'm not taking as much as I normally would"
"

I understand to an extent why they would suggest this, but I think for me the weird part is that they diagnose people, and give a scale to their symptoms"
"Maybe someone with 'mild' symptoms can skip meds some days and still manage to get by, but mine are 'severe' and it's incredibly difficult for me to go back to how I was before starting meds, now that I've seen what I can actually be like and achieve."
"I like to skip my ADHD meds when I'm sick, because that's when I \*want\* the time blindness to whisk the day away as quickly as possible."
"New diagnosis, and I mentioned to my counselor that I had been meaning to try taking weekends off.

Their reply - ""Didn't you try that for the last 20 years? How did that go for you?""

Touche...."
"I take a day off on the weekend pretty regularly and it's mostly because I want a break from stimulant side effects.

I felt like you at first, but now that I'm 39 and 5 years medicated, it's nice to take a break from them"
"Taking a vyvanse and trying to relax on a Sunday was not working for me, so ya break.

I have ADHD and performing better at work is what allowed me to have some stability, which improved every aspect of my life"
My spouse decided to get diagnosed (ADHD as well) and go back to school after dropping out 3 times
"He takes breaks on the weekend too, but our lives have improved immensely because we knew a diagnosis would help with those two things.

I realized I had to get help after my life fell apart at 30, and I knew medication worked for a lot of people"
"So ya, I'm not ashamed to admit, I medicate primarily to survive in corporate America"
"We have to make money to survive in our capitalist society, so what choice do people really have?

And if you mean people who don't actually have ADHD, and are only seeking meds as a performance enhancer.."
they too rub me thr wrong way.
I try to take at least one day a week off
It’s mainly for not building a tolerance but I recently went three months straight of taking it and took a day off and I had to just rot the entire day because staying awake when I am not actively doing something was impossible
"And yeah, the meds help with life in general, but I think it’s best to try to maintain a consistent dosage because it’s great when things just work"
"

And the way I try to see it is the meds are a tool I use to manage my condition"
I also have other tools that I use and if I rely too much on this one tool I may weaken the others
Essentially I don’t want to use the meds as a crutch
"So while I know they’re essential, if I have a day where all I’m gonna do is a hobby or light work, I’m gonna try and skip my meds because I have other tools that can help me but I’m not setting myself up to somehow perform the same without my most useful tool."
I feel like another big part of this is just the adjusting to what the 'new normal' is
"

After I've been medicated for weeks/months straight - it doesn't seem like my meds are doing much for me -- but oh lordy if I forget to take them it's VERY apparent how much they are helping me."
"The biggest drop in efficacy for me will be because of lack of good sleep, water, food, hormone fluctuations."
Yep
My partner is like he isn’t medicated at all if he hasn’t been getting enough sleep
"It’s medication, not magic."
"People get better at masking, and challenges change as you age, which means your ADHD expresses itself different."
I think its combination of people getting better at managing their difficulties and some people find their hyperactivity is less bodily and more mental (comparing their childhood to adulthood.)
They can fluctuate depending on life circumstances and general healh
"Burnout can make them more severe, so can hormonal fluctuation, especially puberty, pregnancy and menopause"
Insomnia is another one
Regular excercise can reduce some of them and make them more manageable
"That kind of thing.

They don't go away, though."
"Masking, external pressures, and health can cause fluctuations in symptom severity"
"Anecdotally, it seems like women get worse ADHD in perimenopause and menopause"
Hormone therapy tends to help.​
"Yes there was an article someone posted here a few days ago about a long term study that showed how many people’s adhd symptoms changed over the years and in different times of their lives, depending on what they were going through"
"Yeah I’d say my ADHD has a new “flavor” for every “era” of my life, but that could be my life influencing the ADHD, or my ADHD influencing my life"
"But effectively, my ADHD felt different at many stages of my life."
"I don’t know from experience, but for women menopause can"
"Your brain develops and ages, and with long-term med usage your brain can become more like ""normal"", as well, so yes."
Any hormonal change can have an impact on how symptoms present and how severe they are
Apparently menopause is particularly bad.
I suggested he seek to clarify before switching doctors
"Switching docs is a PITA.

Most of the people posting and responding on here have ADHD: you, me, OP,  etc.."
"None of us need advice to ""run for the hills."" That's our first instinct"
That's what our lived experiences have taught us to do
"

It's also, for my money, the most commonly given advice on this sub"
But I can't remember the last time I thought it was the best advice.
I think the two concepts can coexist
My understanding is ADHD is a neurodevelopmental difference in our brains—hence it being hereditary
Early intervention with stimulant medication allows for easier time building positive neural pathways in the brain
"Essentially you “cope” with the systems effectively and build routines that handle symptoms without requiring the stimulants at a certain point to regulate.

Does that mean the underlying difference ceases to exist? Not to my understanding"
However the symptoms are handled effectively potentially without medication
"You still have the biological differences that contributed to ADHD, but its adverse effects are managed.

(As a late diagnosed woman, I honestly don’t think I’ll ever hit that point"
Unlearning unhealthy coping skills and catching up with medication in my thirties is never going to bring me to that point
Super promising kids today are seeing better outcomes!)
"It was a problem back in the day because people were citing these remissions as being proof that the diagnosis was hogwash, and parenting was to blame"
The research helped to show otherwise.
"The point is, how does a doctor not know what you have said"
"Such a basic thing to know.

Adapting does not mean the symptoms are gone, you just learned how to not cripple as noticeably"
"Some can and some can't, but the struggles don't disappear"
I am off meds cuz I have adapted but I am not living without struggles
"Or just because I can survive in the wild, it doesn't mean it's any less dangerous or difficult to live in the wild."
"We actually know the reason pretty well now -- early avoidance is the problem.

The rough timeline:

* 1990s
   * People noticed peanut allergies going up
   * Parents started getting worried, some stopped giving their kids nuts as a precaution
* 2000
   * American Academy of Pediatrics and other groups started recommending that high-risk infants avoid peanuts or other potential allergens until age 3
   * Pediatricians and parents ran with that and stopped giving their kids nuts and other allergens
   * Allergies went up
* 2008
   * British & Israeli researchers published a study that found almost no peanut allergies in kids who were given Bamba (a puffed peanut-based snack) as one of their first solid foods
   * American Academy of Pediatrics rescinded their recommendation to avoid allergens
   * Many kids continued to have delayed exposure
      * Some due to parents / pediatricians not being aware of updated guidance
      * Others because their daycares / homes / schools couldn't have nuts present because other kids had allergies
* 2015
   * Results of a longer-term study (LEAP ""Learning Early about Peanut Allergy"") were published confirming that early introduction of potential allergens reduced the long-term chances of allergy
* 2017
   * American Academy of Pediatrics shifted to specifically call for early introduction of allergens for high-risk infants

  
As with a lot of things (like ADHD), a lot of parents and even pediatricians are still operating based on outdated information and making the problem worse."
"Yea, probably wasn't the best example for me to pick for that reason lol"
Though I brought it up to illustrate something else.
"My symptoms are severe, and weekends off works well enough for me"
"That changes when I have a lot to do, but overall I see better results"
"When I take a full 7 days on, the overall efficacy very notably wanes toward the weekend, and the next Monday is much worse"
"When I take as little as 1 day off, the next 3 days feel much more effective"
"

I really think it just depends on who you are"
"There are some paradoxical reactions between people with ADHD and meds of all sorts, and we still don't know enough about exactly how deeply ADHD affects the CNS, where stimulants impact quite a bit."
Same (although I rarely get sick)
"Also, if I need to take pseudoephedrine for a cold, that means I can't also take stimulants"
"

Taking days off here and there when sick (or hungover) also helps to build an emergency stash for the next shortage (or next time I run out but can't force myself to go to the pharmacy)."
Literally not able work today because I had two hours sleep and Ritalin simply won't work in these circumstances.
"> It's also, for my money, the most commonly given advice on this sub"
"But I can't remember the last time I thought it was the best advice.

It is weird, it really seems to be the only advice you get in here"
"If the Doc is not giving us our Medications/Diagnosis, he is always a Quack who is 100% wrong, possibly needs to be reported to the board"
"

I find the Sub to be more and more just not being good for me"
I was hoping to find Discussions around how to work around our Symptoms
"Yet I keep reading the Venting Threads instead (which vastly out number the more productive threads), and just get worked up needlessly 😓"
"Fantastic read, thank you!"
Oh yeah for sure
I also know people that have severe symptoms but seem to do fine on no med days
"I’ll do one day without but physically I struggle immensely with two, so instead I’ll just take my morning dose both days and skip the second one which seems to work for me, or I’ll do one day without any and half dose the second day"
Definitely different for everyone it seems
I take a day off on week-ends
"The stuff I do on week-ends--yardwork, maintenance around the house, etc.--doesn't require the same level of 'stick-to-it-until-it's-done' as work stuff."
Yep
"My partner can scrape by on *one* night with like 6 hours, but multiple nights of less than 7-8 hours or if he has something complicating his exhaustion levels like being sick, meds just don’t help enough"
He is really really sensitive to sleep and his ADHD
"(My ADHD doesn’t seem to be as sensitive to sleep, but my depression absolutely is"
"If I have a couple nights of not enough sleep, I will be more depressed until I replenish my sleep battery, as it were.)"

Recently started a diet

"I’ve lost 25 lbs in the past 4 months and what has helped me tremendously is to not keep any food that I can cheat on in the house, and to meal prep"
Every other Sunday I meal prep for lunch and dinner and use small boxes that I can’t overstuff
"I go to Costco and check the food label and plan to make each meal roughly 400-500 calories.

For snacks I will find low calorie foods that are delicious and know how much of a portion I can have"
I also limit eating out and I don’t exercise because I notice that I get really tired if I do
"

I also set a daily reminder to keep up the work that I’m doing, and to remind myself to keep going"
"

I haven’t had any intrusive thoughts aside from some cravings, which has been better managed by me taking adderall consistently."
Boy I’d love this answer…
My highest was 303 and now I'm down to ~235 so I'm down 70 pounds this year
Cutting back on extra added sugar helped me tremendously
I've been yo-yoing around 230-240 over the past few months but that's because I've been a sugar addict as of late.
"I find lacking of vitamin D and fish oil in my diet is extremely detrimental for my impulse control 

Also zinc helps to stay mentally sharp

Supplements have helped me tremendously now I’m not on meds anymore"
Dr
Russell Barkley has said that if someone is having trouble losing weight despite having the knowledge and support they need they should be screened for ADHD
"

This is something ADHD ppl have trouble with"
My husband dropped a bunch of weight when his job got more physical- which is the opposite of your experience
"

It comes down to figuring out how to juggle the routine of it all"
"You know- that thing that we are neurologically unable to do? 

Meds can help with this"
There are some ADHD meds that specifically help with this and there some ppl who find their intrusive thoughts and binge eating stop when they find the right med for them
You can talk to your doc about this
"

One thing that might help is getting a height adjustable desk and an under desk tread mill"
You don’t have to use it all the time but even increasing your activity level 10 mins a day will help
"Then go for 15 mins, etc."
I'm training pro-wrestling and medieval combat
"Going to the gym alone is depressing and in a group I get too distracted and end up talking and I'm a world-class chatterbox.

So having a group with something I can get into rather than struggle like a chore helped me."
Thanks for the tips
I have it easy when it comes to cooking as I have experience and I have taken up the challenge of going out of my comfort zone to cook healthy
"I do day-by-day cooking because it relaxes me.

I also have it easy as in my country there are warning labels so it's easy to find out which snacks are healthy (Still I cook a lot of them myself, to be sure)"
I also avoid sugars because I can binge consume food with it like candy
Cutting out sugar from drinks was enough for me to drop 20 pounds at least.
"I dropped all sugar since June.

Did wonders to me"
"Still I had a higher starting point, around 156 kg (343 pounds) and I'm currently at 139kg (306 pounds)"
"I never used meds for the ADHD, I got the diagnosis when I was young and my parents (A Chemist and a Biochemist) didn't want to use pills"
"I mostly manage and I can say I'm a productive member of society, I rarely go off-track, but adding the diet over my already strained attention span caused some difficulties."
I'm also very physically active
I typically do 12-15 miles a day walking and cutting calories.
"I'm doing around 15 km a week walking.

12-15 miles a day walking? Isn't that like 24 Km?"
"Yep! My most active day was over 18 miles which I think was ~42,000 steps."

Document summarization and comparison have been really helpful for me personally.

You can feed two rental leases into a model and have it talk about the major differences between them for instance, and while its not perfect it really helps save a lot of time when reading if you know some of what you are looking for before you start looking.

Or the documentation for last version of a piece of software with the new update, if the docs are huge.

I don't mind using it to write messages but it gives off a vibe that is too positive for anyone to actually believe it came from me.

I recommend the Phillips Sonicare 5100
" It’s got a 30 timer which will buzz to alert you to go to a different area of your teeth to brush, so it’s easier to not forget to brush one area"
" Plus, it’s got a replacement brush reminder, so you know when to change it"
 Make sure you get a model like the 5100 and check to see if it has features like these
 Not all of the Sonicare’s have them
" It is worth the price for your dental health to get these features though and spend the money on an electric toothbrush like this.

I also have a suction cup holder under my shower head to hold my toothpaste and toothbrush"
" It doesn’t get very wet there, and I don’t forget to brush because it’s right there when I get in, and it’s the first thing I do when I shower"
 I like brushing in the shower as well
" It saves time and is cleaner since the Sonicare can spray everywhere if you open your mouth while it’s on, haha."
Also! My dentist highly recommended swishing water with hydrogen peroxide to help with swollen gums/bacteria and it’s been a game changer! It obviously won’t clear out all bacteria because we naturally just have bacteria in the mouth but it’s helped me so much
"I just count 1,2 when I’m putting it in a cup of water"
It does have a yucky after taste but my gums haven’t been this healthy in decades.
"I did the same a while ago, and I also agree"
"My teeth have still gotten worse and more sensitive because of my sugar consumption, so I've had to switch to toothpaste for sensitive teeth but still, my teeth are cleaner with it than without and I will never go back."
"My dentist isn't a jerk, I think she's got reasons to belive that and she was trying to help."
Oral b works for me
It's the same with me
"The electric toothbrush is awesome, but my dentist doesn't agree with it"
She says it's for the disabled.
Same here this is the one I had (it died) and I loved it
It was super amazing
How much water do u use in comparison w the hydrogen peroxide?
Oh my gosh
My dentist has been begging me to use one for years now
Lol 
"Well… we’re kind of disabled, right? We do have a disorder which makes certain things hard to do, like brushing your teeth"
"

But on a more serious note, what’s wrong with your dentist? Electric toothbrushes always clean better than regular toothbrushes"
At least if you use it correctly
So why the hell use a regular toothbrush when it’s harder to do and almost always less effective.
Your dentist is being ridiculous
"Electric toothbrushes are a much better option for most people.

Guessing they're the 1/10 dentist."
lol
Your dentist sounds like kind of a jerk
"Sorry if this is a dumb question, but did you try replacing the battery?"
I do about as much water I can comfortably swish with and then add the HP in
It gets foamy as you swish because of the peroxide so it’s kind of trial and error
"I got told that if you use any brush correctly they will clean the same, but if your technique isn't that good an electric toothbrush will be better (which is a lot people tbh)"
This is just so people don't think they HAVE to have an electric toothbrush to have clean teeth.
No it’s not a dumb question! It’s not battery powered it’s a rechargeable one
Unless I j wasn’t paying attention I never saw a part for a battery
Thank you so much!
"If you search for studies manual vs electric, electric always beats the manual toothbrushes"
"Especially for plaque removal.

But! For people who can’t afford an electric toothbrush, or can’t stand the vibrations / sensation, a manual toothbrush is still a great option"
Much better than not cleaning your teeth at all
And regularly going to the dentist will help you keep your teeth healthy.
My bad
 I just looked it up
 I remember from the instructions there was a part about removing the battery
 But the instructions for removing the battery are JUST to take it out to recycle it not replace it.
Of course!!
"
i guess they told me that so i dont feel bad about it! Now that im older its good to know the truth tho"
"No ur totally fine! 

Ohh I still have it so I will look and see if I missed that part😭"

One of my solutions is investing
"The vast majority of the money I put toward retirement is parked in mutual/index funds, but I take small amounts that I can comfortably afford to lose, and pick stocks with that"
It gamifies it enough to be fun and interesting
"

I can afford to lose a couple hundred bucks in the long-term and it protects my other larger account balances from myself."
The environment around us is carefully and surgically designed to make us overspend
I even wrote a very long thread about this
The fix in my opinion is to pivot our brains to a new metric - Free Cash Flow
CFOs use it to curb spending/investing urges of CEOs
I’m finding out it helps for personal spending too
"

I used to spend like crazy but ever since tracking FCF, I’ve become a LOT more thoughtful.

Happy to brainstorm."
I’ve had an overspending habit my entire life
"My partner, on the other hand, has always been incredibly frugal"
They’ve been a good influence on my spending
"We thrift, scour local free/exchange groups, etc"
"

Sometimes If I feel that itch I’ll consult them about it and they help me rationalize not spending"
But even with someone keeping me accountable I still go through waves of spending
I spent $150 on Rust skins and a new D&D book this week and I definitely should not have spent that money.
I like YNAB for budgeting
Seeing where all my money is and where it’s going
"What gets measured, gets managed"
"

For impulse control, I leave things in my cart for 48 hours"
Anything over $50 is a conversation with my partner unless it’s from my spending money budget
It’s hard and I’ve failed a bunch but I keep trying each week and I’ve gotten better
"

If I’m spending multiple days researching it and I’m noticing mood swings due to not getting to buy something I definitely don’t NEED in order to stay safe and healthy, that’s usually a sign I need to put it aside for a couple of weeks because it’s become an unhealthy hyperfocus"
I can get in these weird spaces with tech or audio equipment that make me unpleasant to be around if I can’t go to the store right now and buy it
Those are items I’ve learned I probably really don’t need and I need to get outside and unplug for a while instead.
"Usually fish oil supplement helps and also exercise

Over spending seen most in lack of impulse control individuals"
Qube is helping me get back on track
I wish I would have found it earlier
"I’m able to pre allocate all of money to individual “qubes” for all my bills, savings goals, spending categories, etc"
this way I don’t see a “big” number in my account and think I can spend more than I know I should
I keep cash on me to prevent me from spending it on random online things
"When I go out, I leave my bank card at home"
"(You can't spend cash if you don't have it on you) 

I also avoid having my card on Google wallet"
"

Hope this helps!"
Wait a minute for every dollar/euro you want to spend on something other than normal groceries etc
Re-evaluate if you still want/need it.
This is the way
I curb my impulse spending by buying more money.
I tried to get into rust but I never really knew what to do
it seems like such a fun game too
"Lol but I'm the same way, I bought a lot of destiny 2 skins and stuff lol"
This and a budget
"Sometimes the money I buy is shitty and not worth as much after a few months haha but even if a stock halves in value, I still have half of the money I started with instead of none of the money I started with as is the case with most of the other things I buy."
Yeah I’m a sucker for a good skin.
"I'm just DCA'ing into the S&P, whatever is left over in my paycheck per week."
people think its a myth but it makes us play better

"Not advice but I feel for you brother, college student and just split with my gf of 6 years last month for similar reason"
Told mutual friends she felt more like a mom than a gf
"Diagnosed 3 weeks later, ADHD-PI.

  
2 main points from my experience:

\- don't be too hard on yourself, especially the inability to talk about heavier things with them"
"It takes two to tango, and it's very unlikely the fault lays squarely at your feet"
I've had much deeper heavier conversations with my close friends the last few weeks than I was ever able to with them
"Helped me realize I wasn't with someone I could connect with on a deeper level, and that's no one's fault (getting together in high school is a trip)"
"I hope you're able to find that connection somewhere and not blame yourself

\- You'll be much better equipped when you get back to dating"
"Really happy to hear you're getting to a better place, sounds like you're learning about yourself"
"And with that you'll be better able to express yourself to a future partner and say ""Hey, I'm ADHD, here's some of the things to expect from me and how I'm dealing with them"
"Please be patient with me"""
"The right person will be there to be supportive and help keep you accountable, and you'll better understand how to navigate yourself and relationships

  
Keep your chin up, I'm proud of you :)"
"Best ADHD advice: pills don't build skills.

Medication is great, and often necessary, but you need a professional to teach you how to not ruin relationships, how to function in life, how to be accountable, etc"
"Get a therapist or counselor to go along with the new meds.

Also don't drink orange juice withing a couple hours of taking your meds"
the vitamin C nullifies the effects
"Bump up your protein intake too, especially in the AM"
ADHD brains need a LOT of protein.
I also recently got out of a relationship that I couldn't be consistent in
"I'm sorry dude, I know it sucks, especially when it's someone you really have good chemistry with.

Best advice I can offer is to learn from this, so that you can try to do better in the next relationship"
We'll figure it out one of these days.
No that feeling I could have been something better was I properly medicated with Adderall XR instead of experimentally poisoned by Straerra and Ritalin as a kid is more apt.

"No clue about blood donations, but I'd look into if there's any accommodations you could get in college if you did get the diagnosis"
"If there's any support in school for it, or youre struggling to the degree you want to go on medication/specific therapy treatments, you might really benefit from being able to access that with a formal diagnosis, but if it's just for your own knowing, it might not necessarily be as useful unless you can spare the money just to be sure you no longer have to wonder ""what if"".
For me it was covered by insurance, but my main motivator was not having to wonder and just confirm or deny it being the case, and if it was, to be able to access support for it (I was already diagnosed autistic a few years prior and really struggling with life things)."
">I’m going to go to college next year and I’ve been wondering if I should bother getting diagnosed for ADHD.

If you're struggling to study now, have issues with deadlines and such ***OR*** if you're someone who hasn't had to study hard while in high school, I definitely think it's a good thing to do"
"College is a lot more, a lot harder and on a shorter notice"
"Even if you won't be using medications (I do, however, recommend it), you can probably ask for extra accommodations during exams and extended deadlines (more time, smaller room with less distractions, etc)

I also would like to know if you can donate blood while taking most adhd 

Yes, you'll still be allowed to :-)"

"Coasted through high school and got to college, waited til everything almost fell apart to see a therapist who suggested I get screened.

  
Can't speak to medication as I'm still in the process of getting a prescription, but doing the research to understand how it impacts you and starting to find what systems/structure works for you now can save you years of frustration and self doubt down the road"

OP I don't want to assume gender but I (40F) have found that my adderall has little effect during the luteal phase of my cycle
When I looked into it I found that this is common with women with ADHD
It sucks.
I hate days like that
I often wonder if it’s related to caffeine intake/food but I haven’t figured out a pattern yet
I’ve also read something about citrus/grapefruit decreasing efficacy? But I’m not sure if that’s been debunked
"Anyway I feel your pain, I hope we both find some answers."
"100% with you on this I've been on it for decades, Adderall for me, but I was on Vyvanse at one time had a very similar experience with both and continue to do so"
"From my experience there are things you can do to help potentiate the maximum benefit of the medication, with sleep and eating right and healthy lifestyle Etc.

One thing I have noticed though, whatever this phenomenon is can be minimized, even when I do everything right sometimes it still doesn't work.."
"Then one day when I'm running on 2 hours sleep, woke up hungover, had fast food today before and the medication will work sometimes too well.

I'm sure it's different for everyone but the inconsistency seems to have gotten worse as I've gotten older"
"Sleep, hormones, stomach acidity, stomach contents… so many variables"
It just adds another layer of frustration to a condition that is already so frustrating to treat
🙃
"Yup, as a 33 y/o taking 20-30mg, I’ve been sleeping poorly since last Thursday night and my ability to focus is very limited"
"Like, comparable to well slept but may as well not have taken meds kind of limited.

On normal days and weeks when I sleep, eat right, hydrate with electrolytes, workout lightly and take my vitamins I feel like a super human usually though compared to what I did the rest of my life (a semi bed ridden bum)"
I was just thinking about this today and wondering if it was even worth it to take my medicine or if I should just let this be a break day.
Some days don’t work for me bc my depression worsens executive dysfunction
"Even if i don’t feel as sad as I usually do, the weight of not feeling productive makes me less productive"
"

It’s not always that the fault is within the meds at least for me (unless it’s a tolerance thing and I gotta cycle) but rather with my energy level dictating my thoughts and decisions subconsciously or not"
I feel less capable of utilizing what my meds offer depending on my current state of mind
"Try to sleep with playing this sound

https://open.spotify.com/episode/2nEOFZPeubdpn62NZpH2TF?si=XlNjjOjZRAalf_Q-UnM8Pg&utm_source=copy-link

Focus on the sound instead of your thoughts and it'll help you fall asleep faster without racing thoughts

I find it a week ago and now I can't sleep without it"
"I'm not on meds but for the past year, caffeine has been negatively impacting me.

I just changed up my diet and some supplements and suddenly it works again!

I can't say which one helped.

I added trace minerals, TMG, and more leafy greens"
"

If suddenly stimulants are having no effect or adverse effects, check to make sure you're meeting your dietary needs, especially all your minerals and electrolytes, and stimulants can have a big impact on those"
"

Leafy greens, nuts and seeds are rich sources of minerals if you want to avoid pills."
Are you female? I find that my vyvanse 40mg works very different depending on where I am in my cycle.
"For me I’ve noticed that I need to fulfill the basic needs to give my brain the best possible chance it has to succeed with the help of medication.

In order of importance:
Sleep ( 7-9 hours),  
Food
Exercise"
" 

Without those needs being met it won’t matter"
 I just can’t focus too well
 Might be able to in short bursts.
There was one day I woke up after like 4 hours of sleep and I just couldn't get it going
Maybe when I take my pills I'll feel more normal..
So I took my normal medication at 7am like usual
"And by noon I was still exhausted.

So I decided I'd wake myself up with a run"
That's it
"I just need to get my blood flowing, and I'll be right as rain!

I go for a run and realize about 20 minutes in that I'm not waking up"
I'm just running exhaustedly and making myself more tired than I was
"There is zero waking up going on.

-------------

Sometimes no amount of medication or exercise will stop you from being tired.

Also - I don't think I'd ever adjust my medication"
"Having a steady, predictable rate of medication, taken at around the same time every day, IMO is what leads to the best outcome for me"
Keeps me from feeling like I'm on a rollercoaster.
i don't think telling people to adjust their dose and skip days and double up is helping anyone
if your dose doesn't work talk to doctor
 i worked in the field the last decade and have adhd and i wouldn't skip days for anything
"

it just increases the depression and anxiety yo yo"
 every time you take more than your prescribed dose you are making the normal dose less effective
"

much love"
" i get it tho, this shit sucks.

also confused with how you get 10 mg out of 50 mg vyvanse"
 doesn't sound healthy to me
" messing with time release.


i do wonder if , dealing with delayed circadian rhythm problem would solve a lot of stuff for us."
Mine is seriously affected by my sleep
If I don't sleep well then it's like I've taken half a dose or something
"And it doesn't matter if I take a higher dose than normal either.

If I get up at my natural time which is around 10am, one dose will last me all day"
"If I have a good sleep and wake up at 8ish, which is standard, two doses is perfect.

I wonder if it's something to do with how Elvanse is processed, because it has to be converted by the red blood cells before it can be used I think?"
"If I eat protein for breakfast and limit sugars/carbs this has seemed to eradicate this problem.

The minute I switch back to bagels for breakfast, nothing works."
Ya on days when I haven't gotten more than 5 or 6 hours of sleep my meds don't even budge
Or when I have a migraine incoming (because of pressure changes from the weather).
"So many things:
Sleep, stress, if you’ve eaten too much or not enough, water intake, how you are physically, where’s your mental, and (if you’re a woman) periods can all have an impact on whether your meds work"
And some days everything could be fine and it still feels like the meds aren’t working
"If you think about it, it’s normal"
Even people who don’t struggle with executive dsysfunction have days where they can’t be productive or focus
"Take it as a sign to just take the day off and relax, decompress, treat yourself"
"You gotta remember that your brain is a muscle and like the rest of your body, it needs a break sometimes."
"Make sure your meds aren't among those rendered inert by something in your diet, like orange juice."
"Yeah…I notice this when my stress is high, or something is bugging me."
Pms week renders mine useless
Anytime it’s overcast my adhd is worse
It’s like I don’t fully wake up.
If you don’t sleep well - ADHD medications don’t work as well as they should
Also avoid anything that is orange flavor
"No orange juice, orange soda, an orange, and orange candy as it will counter ADHD meds."
"I think meds work best with adequate restful sleep, but that doesn't mean they're not working when we don't get sleep"
"If I sleep poorly, it *feels like* my meds did nothing — but I know that when I sleep poorly and don't take my meds, I do feel even worse.

I recently read that ADHDers are THREE TIMES more likely to have sleep apnea than the general population, so I'm definitely going to be getting tested for that soon."
"Hi OP, not sure what your gender is but it’s quite common for meds not to work/wrk very little during luteal phase"
"Doubling on the meds can help,  my psychiatrist approved of this approaches and prescribed „extra” meds"
"While luteal is 12-14 days, from my experience the issue is not present all of those days and is not one couple of days cluster either"
I can see the correlation between estrogen and progesteron drops - Google graph on these hormones for the cycle if you are interested
For me the first day of luteal (ie coming from ovulation) is the worst as it’s the most extreme drop from high (ovulation )  to low basically overnight
It sucks for a few days then gets a bit better and then sucks again 2-3 days before the period
I go through the same thing
"I read acid in the stomach is not good, so I try taking Tums about an hour or so before I take it, and I take it with another tums"
It is the usual dose of antacids for calcium supplement
Taking a little nap after my Adderall works pretty good because it makes me feel really really sleepy sometimes
I have also had an energy drink with my lunch and sometimes that helps
"But as far as getting the same results every day I never have, and that is frustrating! My guess is that it is very sensitive to our bodies chemistry or we are very sensitive to the uptake of the meds."
"Yeah, if you fall out of your routine or get too little sleep or don't eat enough, it significantly reduces the meds effectiveness, I've had to be stricter with myself in recent times as otherwise the meds barely work"
They become the equivalent to a cup of coffee if you're not sleeping an eating right.
I'm guessing that most of the time the meds have the same effect as they ususally do
"The variance you are describing is probably because your underlying ability to function varies, because of factors other than medicine"
"This could be stress, lack of quality or quantity of sleep, diet, exercise, coming down with some sickness etc etc"
There are so many factors contributing to ADHD symptoms it's very difficult to narrow down what causes what
If you didn't take your meds on the days you feel that they aren't working your functioning would be similarly reduced.
Lack of sleep makes them not work at all for me.
Yes
Just yes
"

I’ve been experiencing this with adderall"
"Even with the generics that work great for me, inevitably I will have a few days a week where I am exhausted and unmotivated/depressed even with my medication"
It’s seriously got me considering looking into other options.
"Sleep apnea can get misdiagnosed as adhd 
And sleep apnea in it's self is common among adhd people making adhd symptoms worse 
Maybe you need to look in, too"
It
I needed to read this today
Thank you.
You are right 
Some times it's food related 
Sometimes it can be lack of or too much sleep 
"Sometimes its just we are in a blah mood , or sometimes we are in bad moods"
Lack of exercise./ Too much exercise
"

."
or maybe it's just me lol
I also believe that prescriptions aren’t as potent as they used to be
I would suggest people with ADHD to try GABA
Mix into water and drink - you'll have the best sleep in your life.
I have noticed my hormones make a difference in the effectiveness of my meds
"I currently take 25mg er adderall and a 10 ir mid day (when I can even remember) 

And some days I am completely batty with all of that"
Ugh
Some of us get a whole 10 -14 consecutive days out of the month that our meds don't work
"Thanks, hormones!"
I took my Adderall at 8:15am
By 10:30am I was feeling foggy and had a headache
Ate a bag of peanuts and I’m mostly better
I’ve also noticed that although I drink electrolytes it makes a difference how much and when.
I don’t take Vyvanse (I take Adderall) but I recently talked to my doctor about this because it happened to for a few days in a row
The first things she asked me about were sleep and stress
"I was sleeping totally fine (better than usual even, weirdly enough)"
"For me, it was stress and being too overstimulated/overwhelmed."
I keep trying to get my morning routine down to include a high protein breakfast to make my 40 mg of vyvanse  as effective as possible! But some days it’s just the protein powder in my coffee that I have as I swallow my pill
When I eat more like yogurt eggs first thing it seems to be more effective.
Today it was the other way around
Took normal dose and it feels like i took double
Wtf why is it so strong sometimes?
my meds seem to require sleep nutrition and hydration for effectiveness.
"One thing to keep in mind is that ADHD brains are different from 'normal' brains and that the drugs we take don't necessarily boost us, just get us closer to the 'normal' baseline needed to complete tasks that society wants from us"
"And since the brain is an organic thing which simply cannot function at the same level at all times, this is completely expected and nothing to feel bad about!   

While Concerta (27mg) has definitely changed my life for the better, the way I like to think about it is that the medication supplies my gas-guzzling brain with reliable fuel without relying on the random bolt of inspiration to strike, but it's up to me to steer it along the right path, with good habits like exercise and whatnot"
"With medication, I'm just able to steer the car that is my brain wherever I please"
"Some days my soul will just want to rest and faff about, and that's all fine."
Do you mind me asking what pharmacy you go to? The only pharmacy near me that carries Vyvanse seems to be Walgreens
"The problem is that every time I try to get a refill, I get put on hold for an outrageous amount of time"
"Last time I tried refilling my Vyvanse prescription at Walgreens, I was on hold for 3.5 hours (seriously)"
"
Also wondering if you take Vyvanse or the generic of Vyvanse"
"
This ADHD med shortage is kicking my butt!"
For me that's every day
"Sole ADHD meds don't work during PMS 

Edit : some* not sole"
Mine does not work on the weekends
I always end up taking a nice little nap instead of doing all the chores that I initially took my stimulant to complete 😂
Mine never works anymore since I can only get the non adderall version of it
Yesterday I took it and it just made me feel sick and dizzy :(
"Sleep, and protein in the morning"
 Many of the stimulants will be inefficient if you don't take with some protein.
"Sleep, nutrition, hydration."
I have a work colleague that is on a high dose and she takes a day off each week from her meds
"
She says it makes it more affective"
"
I’ve only just started my journey and have broken sleep."
It's definitely dependent on sleep
"On nights where I get terrible sleep, I usually don't even bother taking them, because they do nothing but make my mouth dry."
"Yeah, there are days I've had, usually when I don't or haven't been getting enough sleep, where I can tell my medication (adderal) doesn't work as well"
"It helps, but only so much.

If I wake up with a ton of sleep inertia too it can effect how well things work for the first hour or so, even if I slept well.

Also, depression"
"I've certainly had a harder time of it since the election, not helped by needing to ration because it's been on backorder for my last two fills"
"That's been getting easier to process, but still a slog."
People *wildly* underestimate the impact of acidity
"If you take your meds after drinking orange juice for example, they straight up won't work.

If I were you I'd start tracking everything I consume for a while"
I bet after a short time you'll see a correlation.
"I don't know what your gender is, but if you are female, there have been a few studies showing ADHD medication doesn't work at all durning certain times of the month"
"In the luteal phase, women have noticed that the meds don't work at all and can make it worse"
🤷🏼‍♀️
Avoid foods that produce glutamate
I’ve noticed that during my cycle it’s basically just keeping me at my base level without meds instead of having me tank and sleep for a week
I’m female and suspect PMDD and AuDHD
"My shit doesn’t work when: 

•I’m on my period
•Ate a late dinner the previous night
•A bit sleep deprived 
•Take it too early or not on routine with my usual dose
•sometimes for no fucking reason at all 
•If I eat breakfast or even a bite of ANYTHING before I take it
•if I feel a bit sad or anxious 

LOL"
"Sleep-related comorbidities with ADHD are just ridiculous...

I can be hangdog tired come 3PM, but absolutely become wired on the way home and am in no way *feeling* somnolent when my partner is ready to retire for the evening."
"I haven't been taking meds for long (few months), but I feel the same"
Before starting meds I had days where i felt 'normal' and productive and I still do
I also had days where I felt like absolute shit and could just not do anything besides existing
I guess it's still the same now and maybe the meds work extra well on days where I feel better by default and work less on the bad days
"

I also have days where I don't 'feel' them working as much, but I know they work, because I can get more stuff done than usually"
"My hormones probably also influence the effectiveness.

I also take either 18 or 36 mg of concerta depending on how I feel after waking up (I can usually tell if it's gonna be a difficult day pretty fast)"
My doctor was okay with this system after I described all this to him so I guess it's fine
Haven't noticed any side effects from skipping days either.
"My first thought is to ask your sex- menstrual cycles interact with meds and I’ve seen a lot of women report that the part of their cycle they are on affects their meds effectiveness.

My second thought, especially if you’re not someone who menstruates but even if you are, is to look at your diet- are you getting enough protein in the morning when you take them? Protein will help your meds last evenly through the day"
Are you eating or drinking anything with citric acid some days? Citric acid will nullify the stimulant med and make it less effective.
"Just like being off meds, everyday is different, sometimes you're happy and full of energy, other times you feel tired and everything is hard"
"
Sometimes my meds work almost too well and I feel like I'm on speed, other times I don't notice that it kicks in.
I guess you notice it everyday when on meds because you are waiting for them to work"
But there are of course as mentioned factors that can affect the meds too.
"I’ve noticed this too, if I’m too exhausted it has a lot less effect than days I’m more wide awake"
"Personally I’ve noticed if your sleep, diet are off then meds work less."
If I don’t sleep enough this happens to me!! So strange
"I'm trying natural ways to cure my ADHD, I have been recommend medication but trying to avoid them for now"
I already have an insomnia issue and I don't want to make it worse by taking Adderall.
"That happens to me too like once a week and in my case it's always because of bad sleep, eating bad, or poorly managed hyperfocus fed by my meds lmao"
It happens too when I'm really sad..
It is what it is! I try to not depend too much on my meds but when they don't work it really sucks..
When that happens I try to just not do anything or doing just what I like and rest..
Over time I've learned to listen to my body and now I know what's the problem 80% of the times
"When it's because of food, I eat whatever I love, because otherwise the no-hunger-whatsoever side effect becomes looping viciously.."
"When it's about sleep I don't try forcing myself with caffeine because then I sleep poorly and the same ends up happening, so I take naps even if I don't feel like it"
When it's because sadness or unknown I don't know what to do..
Hope that helps.
"Sleep is definitely a contributing factor! As a 50-year-old female, hormones can also be challenging"
I thank my lucky stars that the meds help me as much as they do despite what the day may bring.
"having one of those days right now.....have a bunch of technical work to do and feel like my brain is molasses

time to blast some trance techno on youtube and hypnotize myself into productivity"
I’m a female & they don’t really work when I’m on my cycle
"
They also don’t work well unless I’ve slept at least 7-8 hours."
That's precisely what I'm going through today
I felt off yesterday
"Today, I was tired and unfocused—some nights, I slept 8 hours, others for 5 hours"
"
Somebody mentioned perimenopause, and I'm going through that now"
I'm incredibly forgetful some days where I can't even find words
"And other days, I feel like I can conquer the world"
And then you have days like today where I can get enough energy to work out or focus on work
I'm on 30 mg of Vyvanse
"It's frustrating, but it's not like it was when I wasn't diagnosed."
Electrolytes are a big component too and protein
"I also notice when I'm about to be on my cycle and the week of my cycle, I might as well just take a med vacation because they don't work anyway"
I thought I was the only one
"I recall seeing something on tiktok that explained that if you have something with protein with your medication, it increases the efficacy"
"I don't know how well this holds up, but it tracks with my experience!"
"Sleep, protein, anti-oxidants, stress, etc"
Yep and Somedays I can find out before I take it so I don’t waste it 
"I find days that I don’t sleep well, don’t eat a protein breakfast and forget to have lunch end up like this"
(Doesn’t always need to be all 3)
So I normally aim to hit 2 of these minimum
"Days 1 only 1 are a train wreck, days with two can go either way (probably 65/35 will be a good day/bad day), all 3 and I can be pretty certain it’ll be a good day"
"I don’t touch caffeine ever, and avoid acidic foods/drinks in the AM"
I also take a metric shitload of nicotine (snus) all day.
I'm not on Vyvanse but Concerta.
sometimes I just have really bad brain days and it feels like I haven't taken my meds when infact I have
"

I've come to realize that this is just how stimulants are."
"they stimulate your nervous system so it depends on so many external factors like sleep hygine, diet, hydration, overall mood/stress

It can be quite annoying.."
"especially when starting out, I'm not at the 6 month point yet."
so I often wonder if they're working for me or not lol
"Did you consume alcohol or caffeine last night? Both affect quality of sleep, and worsen symptoms the next day. 


This is my go-to question I ask people when they wake up tired regardless of whether they have ADHD or not."
I went through the same thing
After 4 years of taking different vyvanse dosages I eventually built somewhat of a tolerance for it
I even tried extended release adderall and it didn’t have that much of an effect on me
I switched to just adderall short release 10mg and that works for me
I take four a day
I noticed that with short releases while it only lasts about 2-3 hours with each pill at least it works and can get me through the day
I think it’s just how my body metabolizes the drug
"I would talk to your doctor about switching to adderall IR.

Sleep and diet also plays a big role"
Try not to consume a lot of vitamin C or B (watch out for Mio and body armor they have more vitamins than you think)
I scrolled down a bit and didn’t see this mentioned
"When I was taking Adderall, one allergy medication completely counteracted its effectiveness"
"The other one I tried made it just a little bit less effective. 

Last summer was the worst allergy season that I’ve had in years, haha."
I started taking B12
It really helps
"It didn't help my Dad, who also has ADHD."
"Adderall works best for me when I take it with a small breakfast that has some protein, fat and salt before going on a   30 minute walk"
"I swear, by the time I've gotten back from that walk, I am a totally different person."
I feel that
Sometimes I feel like my meds make me so drowsy I can’t pay attention at all.
I agree about the sleep that’s my experience too
The med will spend itself just keeping you awake and so wont be able to do anything else for you.
Are you a woman? Mine never worked while on my period
It’s a known thing
Otherwise i have no clue.
Especially for women starting their periods.
my meds don't help me relax at all and I turn into psychobitch
My new psychiatrist recently said I should do a sleep study if I feel tired when I wake up (I do snore sometimes)
He said that could cause symptoms to increase
So sleep does affect symptoms of adhd
I do notice this a lot
I did an experiment and mixed salt with water one day on adderall and it woke my ass up
Not an idea to copy at all
It was nasty
On days you think it isn’t going to work take a tum before you take your meds
Makes it 10x more potent because of the alkalinity
I wouldn’t recommend doing this all the time though as it’s hard on the body 
"Yup.

I call those bad brain days… :P copying from HowToADHD."
I find I have to take my Concerta with a protein-heavy breakfast
"It doesn’t necessarily hit me fast/hard, but I am just jittery and scatterbrained if breakfast is more carb, less protein."
What you said about sleep is a thing! I did a sleep test to check for sleep apnea a while back and while he didn't find evidence of that he did ask me straight up if I had ADHD (he could see it in the brainwaves on my test)
Apparently our brains don't switch off properly when we sleep as non ADHDer's do
For me it was causing sleep apnea or ammonia type symptoms and definitely had a big impact on my everyday function!
"As a person who menstruates, I really notice a difference in medication effectiveness depending on where I am in my cycle."
"If you're female, estrogen levels fluctuate throughout the month and can affect the effectiveness of the medication"
"Lower levels, less affect"
"And the closer you are to menopause, the more fluctuation."
Are you female? I've heard stimulants don't work as well when we're on our period.
Yep
Mine doesn't work when I'm tired.
 Its sleep mate
You have to sleep properly and for a good amount if time.
Taking it with a full glass of water on an empty stomach and waiting at least an hour before eating or drinking anything else works best for me.
"If you’re on Generic Vyvanse, switch to brand name"
Huge difference for me.
Lack of sleep and anxiety can play a role in its effectiveness.
"Make sure you’re eating enough, that can offset the effects of the drug."
My doc says that the medications effectiveness depends on sleep in order to get you the juice.
I had the same experience! I'm on Ritalin IR & it usually works well
"But they are days when I feel like it's not working and when I look back, I feel like it's related to my sleep"
"If I had enough sleep & a good rest, the medicine will work wonder"
"But if I don't have enough rest, then nothing seems to be helpful enough."
I am so glad I came across this post
I’ve only been on meds for a few months now but I have definitely have had days where it seemed like nothing helped! Now I don’t feel so crazy.
Are you a person who menstruates? I’m not sure if i’m allowed to post links here but if you google it there have been studies that show your meds will stop working at certain times in your hormonal cycle (if you are a person who menstruates).
"I'm not going to dig through your profile to try & figure it out, I'll just ask:  Are you female (or assigned female at birth)?

Asking because I've learned that women tend to get different results from their ADHD meds based on where they are in their menstrual cycle"
" (Men have hormonal cycles and fluctuations too, but they seem to impact adhd meds less \*and\* there's no real way to track where they are in the cycle without doing bloodwork, so that's not really something the average person can explore...)

If this applies to you, I strongly urge you to make a note of where you are in your cycle today when it's not working"
 Where were you last week when it was?  Start a log
" You don't have to keep it constantly/daily, but it will probably be more effective if you do"
" You might find that the week before your period is when your meds lose effectiveness, or maybe it happens during the period"
 Maybe it's closer to ovulation
 Track it for a couple months & see if there's a trend you didn't notice before
 Then talk to your doctor to see if there's something you can do
 Maybe you can try a higher dose just during that time
" Maybe there's a way to make your particular med more effective (some yes, some no), maybe an entirely different med would eliminate this issue for you?  Who knows"
 But best of luck to you!!
">I assume it's something related to sleep.

Yah, that'll do it"
" If I don't sleep, I don't bother wasting a pill"
" Increasing my dose doesn't bring any benefits, just more side effects."
Yes
I too have read a lot that medication is a temporary solution
So if anyone has some long term suggestions please help
"

I really can't get medicines."
"Yup, and unfortunately we spend up to half of our cycle in the luteal phase"
"Yaaaaaaay (*actually sobbing though*). 

I’ve found for myself my meds are least effective in the 5-7 days leading up to my period, and then during my period itself their effectiveness is hit or miss"
I just anticipate it these days and try to plan around it as best I can
"I don’t expect to be my most productive on those days, and I give myself grace of my symptoms are worse or more intense those days"
"We can only do our best, and have to work with the bodies we have"
"I’ve decided not to beat myself up for it anymore 🤷‍♀️ what else can we do, ya know?

Suuuuuuuper not looking forward to menopause someday though"
I’ve heard some real horror stories about how it can impact and worsen adhd symptoms.
I brought this up to my psychiatrist and she prescribed me enough to double my meds during the time in my cycle when they’re less effective!
"I don't know much about that, bcs i'm a man, but i definitely believe in you"
"The tiniest bits of alteration in our brains can make a total difference in how our mood, emotions, energy levels will be."
I almost added this to my response but I didn’t want to assume anything
I’ve noticed my Adderall only KIND OF works during that time
It’s hard to describe because it does work but also doesn’t
🤦🏼‍♀️
What until perimenopause when it utterly stops 
Lol I’m a mess on my period too but I have PMDD. 
Wondering why the hell i was completely off my game today… surprise surprise I also have mad boob soreness and hated everything and everyone yesterday 🙃
Yep
I agree
Also around my period as well.
This is a real phenomenon
"Hormonal shifts can have a massive influence on sleep regulation and sleep quality, energy levels, mood regulation, etc"
"For some people with hormonal imbalances, this may be experienced at different levels of intensity compared to women with more regulated hormones."
"40’s myself, also with PMDD, I’ve read a study where they actually increase their stimulant dose during the luteal phase to help with PMDD too!"
I just turn into a psychobitch on the day I start bleeding heavier 😕 my meds don't help me relax at all
"This is super real, I feel the effect of my fiancée’s hormones strongly and basically feel that I am unmedicated one week per month 😭"
"Heat, both physical and emotional, can impact my stomach"
"

Taking breaks helps me balance things out"
"

Ultimately, it's my own positivity that has the greatest effect."
what about birth control?? i take it every day so no period
does that mean im free from this?
I've heard (here on reddit) that taking Pepcid/famotidine helps with PMS/PMDD symptoms during the luteal phase
I didn't believe it at first but I tried it for myself yesterday..
I'm a believer now lol
Check it out!
"Hey, I totally know, but in case people don’t know…what is a luteal phase? 
Secondarily, for those same people, how would you know your phase if you’ve had an IUD for the past 25 years?"
Yup
I bounced on my medication dose a lot at first because it would just mysteriously “not work”
"Nope, it was my hormones"
The week before my period I can basically skip my medications because they won’t hit
"On top of that, I’m anemic, like 1/3 of all menstruating people, and low iron makes the symptoms so much worse"
"My insurance doesn’t allow for 2 different doses a month, so I’ve been trying CBT and hoping it will mask enough that I stop getting in trouble at work."
I am so thankful to you for posting this
"36F and I couldn't figure out why I was having these recurring, weeklong lapses in productivity, focus, and emotional regulation since starting meds .."
"

Lol turns out"
This makes so much sense.
"Wow that is interesting thank you for posting, going to look into it more now"
Wow I did not know this
This makes a lot of sense now
"I definitely heard that large dose vitamin C can inhibit the absorption of Adderall, I'm not sure that they 100% know why I think that they guess that it's because it's acidic but it definitely inhibits in some"
"The answer is repairing sleep, mate"
It's all about that
I've been worried about exams and last night i was thinking about it in my bedtime
"I probably carried that stress into my sleep and my brain couldn't rest properly

It is what it is"
Resilience is much needed in these days
We have to accept it's a day to sail through.
Grapefruit is well known and documented to effect medications
My doctors have warned me of this before
"Can't speak to the reason, but it's definitely a thing."
"I don't know, I've had caffeine before bed and had the best night sleep and I usually drink an iced coffee in the mornings with breakfast.

I know that protein can help with the effectiveness of adderal, so I've heard"
"I usually get a chicken biscuit or something else with protein for breakfast, so not sure how much that's helped me."
"When I started medication, my provider told me, “In terms of food with medication, nothing citrus.” So, yes, citric acid does have a negative effect"
👎🏻
Waking up out of REM or deep sleep is a common cause
"I’m on my second full week of ditching caffeine for decaf coffee and making sure I have protein with every dose and having meals later.

Definitely has made a world of difference"
Anxiety is gone
"Worry for the future, gone"
"I am kind of feeling like me again.

Doc also recommended I skip a dose every week"
Saturday was that day for me
Nothing got done I just stayed in bed watching movies/tv while dozing off periodically
"Sunday though I kicked into mid gear and got clothes and bedding washed and my room cleaned up.

Last week though was brutal hell"
"I had no energy or desire to interact with anyone.

This week things are somehow better despite not getting enough rest last night"
" Woke up at 1pm, took my dose and downed a protein shake and had a few nibbles of meat leftovers"
"Then fell back asleep for 1.5 hrs, took my bath and now I’m sitting outside work early typing this.

I was also switched back from Vyvanse to generic since it’s back in stock"
Last week I was almost positive the problem was generic
"I think I was just needing to adjust ditching caffeine entirely.

And yeah."
I stay away from orange juice completely no matter how badly I miss it.
"I did realize a few patterns!

**TL;DR:** avoid Citric acid and dairy in times close to consuming your meds and be careful with caffeine.

***Disclaimer***    
*This is by no means medical advice, just sharing MY personal experience with pattern recognition while consuning foods, keep in mind each body reacts differently.*


First of all, I'm taking 40mg ritalin LA a day (20mg at morning and 20mg at night) but it's my general experience with every meds I've taken (vyvanse, Ritalin IR, Ritalin LR) + friends feedbacks.


- **Dairy**    
If consumed within an hour of taking the meds seems to reduce the absorption"
"    
×

- **Greasy food**    
Slows a bit the absorption, but no significant impact from what I've seen    
×

- **Citric acid**    
also makes it hard to absorb the medication, so avoid drinking any industrialized beverages (sodas n soft drinks) since most of them use Citric acid as a conservant"
"(unfortunately for me, no hot lemon and ginger tea with honey in the morning anymore :c)    
×

- **Caffeine**    
Seems to make the roller-coaster ups and downs even more intense, so really just feels like racing in a car with no brakes, high speeds in straight lines but i crash every single damn turn
Besides that, I don't think it's a good idea to take two stimulants together, mainly if you already have heart problems running in your family
(I've ditched caffeine long ago, this pains me a lot since I LOVE matcha, green tea, oolong, Chai and a cup of hot coffee, but decaf has been a huge part in helping me deal with it"
"If you happen to live either in Japan or you've got a japanese themed store you can go to, you can drink Mugicha, made out of wheat, has no caffeine at all!! Helps a lot to find substitutes like these.)    
×

- **Sugar**    
Seems to make the crash a bit worse but other than that, haven't felt any other effects."
You can't have grapefruit because it changes the metabolization of the medicine
"It can cause your body to hold the medicine and then massively release it. 


No grapefruit, ever :-/"
"It doesn’t reduce efficacy more less than it causes more of the medicine(adderall, Vyvanse, and pretty sure amphetamines in general) to be released in your urine, decreasing the time where it’s effective."
"Poor sleep is the really obvious one, for me"
"If I haven't slept well / slept enough, the meds are worse than useless."
Sugar definitely messes me up for the next day.
"When I was taking Adderall, a cup of tea made it work noticeably less, and the one time that I accidentally drank a cup of coffee, it pretty much canceled the Adderall completely.

I just switched to Ritalin, so I’m back in the gathering data phase."
"this makes me wonder if this affects trans women in any way, obviously i don't get periods but there are definitely days where my medication feels like it either didn't kick in at all or was very light, and i wonder if it's related to my injection cycle or progesterone intake"
"This hungover/barely sleep I feel.

Actually feels like I’m on speed some of those days.

I’m not tweaking but it feels like it did the first few days you start the medication"
">Then one day when I'm running on 2 hours sleep, woke up hungover, had fast food today before and the medication will work sometimes too well.

EXACTLY! That was actually the point of my post"
"That's why i say ""something doesn't click properly in the sleep"""
Because i feel like it's some kind of misregulation in something specific
"There were days i had poor sleep too, but the medication worked"
It's kind of black magic.
100% Can confirm!
It is what is
We must use these situations to work on strenghtening our resilience.
It depends
"You don't get the optimal effects, but it definitely lifts you up a little bit"
"So yeah, if you need to go out and do stuff that requires a certain amount of energy, take it"
"If you're in a off day and you need it for studying, i'd say to skip it"
"Go do some running, work out and focus in having a good sleep to have optimal effects in the following day."
Do you have anxiety too?
"haha I hate this, it makes me feel super uncomfortable"
i feel like i would go insane if i had to listen to this for an extended period
do you listen to it at a really low volume?
"Even if it helps with falling asleep, if my stress comes back during my sleep, i will still not get proper rest"
That's the main issue
"But yes, better 8 hours of poor sleep than 7, isn't it? I'll definitely try that, thank you for your input, mate!!"
I stopped taking coffee since the day i had my first and only panic attack
I somehow associated it to the coffee and i rarely touched it since
"I don't feel like it's necessary too, since i alr have meds."
This
Absolutely this
"For about the week leading up to my period, as well as the first few days of my period, meds do nothing"
Vyvanse
Adderall
Dexedrine
Nothing at all.
"This!

But i have to disagree with the last thing you said"
I guess you definitely can force a wake up if you go aggressive with your medication
But i don't think it's healthy.
">i don't think telling people to adjust their dose and skip days and double up is helping anyone.

But i never said that"
That's what i do
"If i were to tell people to do such things, i'd tell them that they're taking the risk, but obviously the right thing is to talk to a doc"
"I do bcs i feel the risks, for me, are worth it.

>i wouldn't skip days for anything"
"

>it just increases the depression and anxiety yo yo

I always do tests and do my researchs to understand what i can do or not"
I've been skipping days since i started my treatment(3 months ago) and it's totally ok for me and my body
"I usually don't take it every friday, saturday and sunday and it's ok for me"
"In those days, i just feel like normal me without stimulation"
But that's very personal
"My father, for example, says he feels shaky and awful if he skips a day.

>also confused with how you get 10 mg out of 50 mg vyvanse"
doesn't sound healthy to me
"messing with time release.

It's because i have it on both presentations, 30 and 50."
"> skip days

quite a few doctors actually recommend ""vacation days"" to help deal with tolerance from medication if you're able to"
Maybe the stress isn't letting you recover your energy during sleep
❤️
"Yup, all of the above for me, food/water/iron/sleep/exercise/daylight.."
If I don't get enough of all of them I seem to go into a real spiral
Use caution if you're on SSRIs as well as a stimulant
" GABA increases serotonin, and serotonin syndrome is godawful."
"Ya'll have problems sleeping? I could take my stimulants and still fall asleep in the middle of the street in front of my house, in the next 5 minutes"
Anytime
Any day
Am i broken?
">I was feeling foggy

Ha! This is the main indication i usually have whether my meds are gonna work that day or not"
"If i feel foggy and slow, vyv will probably not work properly"
"If i wake up feeling sharp and mentally agile, i'm up to a magical day"
"You were having good sleep, despite the stress? I find it hard to believe"
Were you waking up feeling refreshed? Having sleep and having repairing sleep are two different things
I fell asleep fairly easily last night and had 7+ hours of rest
But the actual sleep was very poor.
Be careful with your food intake
"If you take too much, it will slow down medication's release too much"
"Especially with eggs, since it is rich in fat"
Fat slow downs digestion even more.
Be aware that food intake can modulate its release
"If it wasn't food, then yeah, it's just like that"
It's kind of black magic.
"I was gonna say, I’m surprised no one has mentioned hydration yet."
Ha! I always think that
"I'm always like: ""for fucks sake, you did nothing for me today, but you're still dehydrating me and fucking me up with your side effects"
"It's so unfair."" hahaha"
"Yeah, i track all those things down"
I'm a very self-taught person
"My breakfast is usually milk and bread, so not acidity at all i guess."
"A lot of woman reporting that, interesting"
"How do you do find out? For me, it's when i'm foggy and slow"
I tried asking for ir and I’m in Canada they only will give me xr
"Don't worry, mate, it's just like that"
I'd suggest you to pay attention to the variables to understand how your body reacts to it
"But if you're not that kind of person, in my experience, these are the usual things that affect meds more: food intake and sleep."
"I'm a man, but i'll read about it to understand why it happens."
I'm a man actually
24M
"I don't know if it has anything to do with that, but i jerk off sometimes"
"Definitely not regularly, but once or twice every two weeks"
"I noticed some patterns regarding it and i think, maybe, just maybe, it impacts on meds effects"
"Maybe it has something to do with masculine hormones, idk"
"It does nothing for you, but it charges you the same taxes hahaha"
"You cannot build tolerance to ADHD medication, though (as far as I know), so I do not understand how it is a temporary solution."
"For ADHD, the only solution is medication"
We take it so we can have a few hours of a solution
"Other than that, it's just coping mechanisms.

What do you mean you can't get medicines?"
"I am 50f, I went for a diagnosis 6 months ago because my life had blown up in the last few years"
"COVID, I burned out hard at work, unable to put the rest of my life together (never have been able to really)"
I started to recognize myself in video reels
"

I pretty much have to be in perimenopause based on age"
" I am not looking forward to combining this with hot flashes, etc."
So glad you mentioned this because I literally feel like a sack of worthless shit a week before my period and my adderall seems ineffective
😭
"Wow my psych just said, ""Yeah that can happen"" and just moved on."
mine did the same for me!!
I had one doc that would do this and then he moved out of the country
My new doc doesn’t feel comfortable with it
🤷🏻‍♀️ But I just started the patch and it seems to work better all around. 
oooooh!!! I need to tell my psychiatrist this!!
Remindme! 15 days
I kept a food diary for 6 weeks and tried to correlate it with medication effectiveness
I discovered that I can't tolerate dairy products anymore
Since I cut them out my meds work much better.
">The tiniest bits of alteration in our brains can make a total difference in how our mood, emotions, energy levels will be.

This is so accurate"
"It's like a combination of that and potentionally being dehydrated or maybe someone said something they figured was innocent but actually affected you, but then maybe you haven't eaten enough, or maybe you stepped in cat vomit when leaving for work"
"Maybe you just woke up and your first thought was ""AGH FUCK"" for no real reason or something.

I always thought it was bullshit that feeling a certain way before taking meds can make them not function as they should, as if the chemical itself will do all the work for me, until I really hunkered down to try to get to the bottom of my dumb ailments.

My favourite difficult lesson I had to learn was how taking a stimulant/ADHD med in the morning *while still in bed* under the notion that I'll be fully alert and ready to jump into the grind 45 minutes later only resulted in me feeling more relaxed with myself, resulting in ""just gonna chill for a sec"" turning into ""zzzzzz"" lmao."
Have you considered whether diet could be a factor? There is some evidence that ADHD meds work better when combined with proteins.
I just had a conversation with my psych about this on Friday
He's reluctant to prescribe an increase but asked me to do extra exercise any time I feel the meds are less effective.
I couldnt have said it any better😩😩fml
I think I have it too.
even though I take birth control pills ..I still turn into psychobitch when I start bleeding heavier..
The luteal phase is the time period after ovulation that ends when a menstrual cycle starts
I'm not sure if IUD or birth control pill users have a luteal phase- Google has conflicting answers
I think it might depend on wether you are actually ovulating or not.
Citric Acid specifically
Which is in a lot of foods you wouldn’t expect
"
Try to avoid 1 hour before and after taking dose."
"Additionally, high acid foods/drinks will also deactivate adderall.

If you drink coffee, stick to medium/dark roast with your preferred milk of choice"
"I know for Concerta, anything acidic/vit C can affect the coating on the pill which is responsible for the extended release - I also take Ritalin as a booster or on days I don't want to take concerta and my pharmacist to avoid high fats and anything acidic an hour before and after I have taken it"
"YES! If you take a multivitamin, wait at least an hour before or after taking your medication (Adderall specifically) before taking it"
"

Also, on the prescription pamphlet I've noticed it says capsule can be mixed with applesauce if you can't swallow the pill, however, many applesauces have ascorbic acid (vitamin C) added, so you'd ultimately be deactivating the med by mixing"
"But hey, what do I know, I'm just a silly little consumer."
I'd agree with this
Seems to be the case for me
Sleep or lack of because of stress or being overwhemed can do that
As if I haven't taken it at all
 
"> The answer is repairing sleep, mate.

What's repairing sleep?

Anyway, I've been alternating between 3 hours a night and 10 hours a night so it kinda averages out to like 6.5 so it's fine, right?"
I’ve been trying to actually sleep even remotely okay since I was a child
All the “normal” suggestions have been extremely counter productive and everything I’ve tried otherwise has had no impact
"I’m miserable, getting 2-4 hours a sleep a night (been that way since I was a kid), and I’m at a loss"
"I’ve talked to doctors, psychiatrists, and therapists"
Nothing
Some days I feel like there’s no point in even trying and I’ll just eventually drop dead from health complications due to severe lack of sleep.
"I have an oura ring that tells me all sorts of info about how much of what type of sleep I get, like restless, REM, deep, etc"
I'm going to pay attention to this
I'm betting it's worse on the days when I get little to no deep reparative sleep.
This
I took a 5mg melatonin sublingually and went to bed early last night and I still couldn’t sleep properly
I was in and out of sleep and I maybe got one hour of rem sleep because of the anxiety of the coming exams
I have 3 exams left on the last 3 weeks of class for one class
Now this morning my 20mg XR Adderall didn’t take affect even after an hour so i had to take another one
But even that didn’t last as long as it should’ve
 I probably only got 4 hours of it before i noticed my cognitive processing decline
I ended up having to buy Red-bull as a booster.
The furanocoumarins in grapefruit bind to the CYP3A4 enzyme which is what metabolizes drugs in the liver
Therefore it inhibits the enzyme
Most drugs have to go through first-pass metabolism in the liver first before therapeutic effect (oral drugs at least)
"Grapefruit is one of many inhibitors of CYP3A4, some induce (enhance the effect of the enzyme)"
"If you have a lot of things in your system that inhibit CYP3A4 you’re more at risk for toxicity and overdose; on the other hand, having a lot of inducers in your system makes you metabolize drugs faster and reduces therapeutic effect."
"Grapefruit very commonly can fuck up hormonal birth control, and it's not talked about nearly enough for that"
It can quite literally render it entirely ineffective and contribute to pregnancies.
The citric acid (or any acidifying agent) in grapefruit juice will affect vyvanse absorption
Usually grapefruit interacts with the metabolism of drugs (not the absorption)
"Grapefruit juice doesn’t affect vyvanse metabolism, but rather its absorption."
"For myself, a protein heavy breakfast with meds makes it a smoother ride for the day"
" If I don't have a good breakfast, I get ."
not quite jittery but definitely don't feel the best.
"Protein ABSOLUTELY helps (at least in my case.) At the bare minimum you should eat with Adderall, but protein (for me at least) improved efficacy and longevity so so so much!"
Because your brain increases catecholamines when you are significantly sleep deprived a couple hours of sleep or less
"It assumes there is an emergency you need to attend to so dumps your brain with neurotransmitters to help you stay alert.

It’s also really bad for you."
"Sleep is like an ever draining container, but its a slow drip"
You need to replenish it each night but occasionally you might not get it as full as it normally would
But you can make it up the next day or even after a couple days
"But if you're consistently not getting enough sleep, its going to drain that bucket"
"

That's kind of a simplistic analogy, and I'm not sure how it would fit with meds working or attention in general but affects of sleep are somewhat cumulative in nature."
I’m doing training for a new job
"It’s work from home, so I can kinda just chill on my laptop and listen to the class"
"It sucks because I know I need to get some things done after work, like shopping and some laundry, and I’m already wanting to just lie down and scroll or watch a movie or take a nap or all 3 😭 thank you for the response, it’s nice to know I’m not alone here"
"yes, i take propranolol for it"
"Low, but high enough to interrupt my thoughts

Idk, for me it's working pretty well"
Maybe falling asleep without racing thoughts would decrease your stress 🤞
"My point is, it's possible that your meds, being stimulants, require the same nutrients to work properly"
How is your diet?
I read today that coffee has a lot of magnesium and there seems to be a lot of anecdotal evidence magnesium helping people with ADHD especially those on stimulant medication
"Taking a strong amphetamine will wake you up, of course"
But I'd rather have a nice even regular dose that I get used to
I don't really feel my pill kick in or ware off
"It's just pretty even all day, every day."
once you take it longer it will probably not work out like that
i still don't understand how you are taking 10 mg vyvanse
" are you saying you get 30 and 50mg so you double up the 30mg those days? 

your tests and research are not a good replacement for your doctor getting your dose right"
  i did about 10 years of messing with my adhd dose in my 20s
 i am 43
it didn't help anything over years it really hurt
take it as prescribed.
that is interesting i will check into it.
I have to have one skip day a week
"I started this when I was taking Adderall, I would call it getting ""Adderall angry"": after 7 days on meds I get very short tempered and can't figure out why"
Now I skip one weekend day every week and it allows my body to reset to the medication.
Me right now
I think I've been on Reddit all day ..
 Whoops
I definitely do
But it's probably because of my pathological anxiety
But i'm on medication now and anxiety/sleep is no longer an issue.
No im on adderall with no sleep issues
😴  Gaba is a natural relaxant that helps to raise seratonin levels.
I feel much more relaxed and have less thoughts on stims so i definitely get sleepy during the day sometimes
I don't feel sleepy when they start to wear off though for like 4-5 hours at least so maybe that is the issue.
I probably am not explaining it well
I don’t really know how to explain it
"Yeah, I was getting good sleep when I slept"
I would basically get waaaay overwhelmed and stressed during the day and then crash HARD around like 7 PM and sleep deeply and good and wake up feeling great for about fifteen minutes
Then all the things would hit me all over again
90% of it was work stress but I also had some family stuff going on
I don’t really know how to explain it
That’s type of thing has only happened to me one other time (that I can remember) and I was in grad school during that
lol
Also days where I don’t want to anything emotionally/nearing burn out and lack of sleep
But I have a health planner and I track several factors each day 
"Hah, nice"
Could someone tell my psych? She won’t let me go above 30mg Vyvanse after being medicated for 2 years.
Mental health is a taboo here
If I seek professional help it's gonna be very difficult for my parents
"

My diagnosis was through an online professional"
For medications I need a doctor's appointment which is not possible for me
"

Could you please suggest me any coping mechanisms as a student? For studies and exams."
"Reels was what got me diagnosed too! Side note the diagnosis really made my life make sense, but I have such a hard time actually accepting it giving my self grace for it"
I may just be in my luteal phase haha but the shame has been sooo badddd like crippling bad so I wonder if yall experience this too
"Same sadly, even though I showed her this: [Female-specific pharmacotherapy in ADHD: premenstrual adjustment of psychostimulant dosage](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10751335/)"
Ugh I’m sorry
I wish there was consistency in all this.
Mine recommended a gynecologist to talk about birth control
I tried BC once and a week later I was a crying mess and unable to function
I’ll take a couple days a month of meds not working as well
I guess I could take extra
"I always miss my second dose once or twice per week, so I have a kind of surplus."
">I discovered that I can't tolerate dairy products anymore

Thank God that's not me"
"Milk is part of my life ❤️.

If you're a milk-lover like me, try to do some tests with small quantities of whatever dairy food you take, so then you can confirm dairy really is the problem"
"And don't eat too much, cause too much food plain and simple slow down meds release"
"Try 200ml of milk with bread or something on your breakfast tomorrow, try not to go over 400kcal"
Eat and then wait 30 minutes or an hour(better) then take your med
"Don't try it just once too, to avoid concluding something based on outliers."
"Watching your diet is definitely a good idea, too, tbh"
"I have to keep high protein snacks around, because if I'm too low on protein any effectiveness from my strattera just goes out the window."
"To add to this, has anyone here tried taking a literal stimulant with the intent of having it help them sleep? I've done so accidentally a few times but have never done so intentionally for obvious reasons."
YES! It’s so hard trying not to analyze every aspect of how I’m feeling bro cuz I just keep spiraling and then the meds don’t work at all! It is so frustrating but I’m glad I’m not the only one experiencing this bc I was so embarassed yall 😭
Thank you.
That's not the same for Vyvanse
Vyvanse literally says if you can't swallow a capsule to pour it in orange juice and drink it. 
1 hour? If I take vitamin c supplements the evening before I go to bed it fucks up my adderall the next day.
Stress messes with the repairing of your sleep
"If you're under constant stress, chances are that you are stressed during your sleeptime too"
And it doesn't allow you to rest properly
"I say this because ever since i started medication for anxiety, i stopped being stressed and tense"
"With this, my sleep is now almost always very refreshing."
"Unfortunately, most people do not appear to get the full effect from sleep if they don't keep a consistent sleep schedule, even if they're getting 8h a night :/"
"Nah mate, up it half an hour, we should be getting at least 7"
Repairing sleep is when you sleep and your body actually rests
"You certainly already had a day you slept for a decent amount of hours, but woke up feeling tired, feeling almost like you didn't even have a night of sleep"
"And you probably had days you woke up feeling fresh, sharp and ready"
This is repairing sleep
"When you sleep, but you actually rest.

Bottom line is: if you wake up and still feel like you want to rest, something is wrong"
This is absolutely not fine sadly
Consistency is key.
">Some days I feel like there’s no point in even trying

I know that right"
I developed the same mindset
"And my parents would never understand it, they would say: ""you don't sleep because you're playing on your computer"""
"And i would say: ""No"
"It's the opposite, i'm playing because i can't sleep"""
"And to this day, they still can't comprehend it.

I was just like you"
"I wouldn't bother trying, i knew i would just waste my time rolling on my bed and making my anxiety worse"
"But fortunately, sleep is no longer an issue"
"I corrected it with medication.

If your sleep issues have its roots in anxiety, just get meds asap"
It'll be life-changing.
Do sleeping meds not work? I wonder how that works. 
"Is there a simple list of common things that either inhibit or enhance cyp3a4 enzyme? 

I had an issue before with an antifungal medication and caffeine where the antifungal blocked the enzyme that metabolizes caffeine (cyp1a2 apparently) so caffeine made me feel like absolute shit and super anxious cause it just didn't exit the system apparently - issue was that this wasn't indicated anywhere or warned about that they have this affect on each other"
"A quick-and-dirty of knowing which liver enzymes interact with which substances in different ways would be a great kind of ""cheat sheet"" to have"
[deleted]
Makes total sense
"Cuz even tho I can sleep 10 hours that night after, I still always wake up the next morning feeling like I’ve aged 10 years and will be completely useless all day with or without medication."
"I’ve learned to live with ADHD 30 years before I was diagnosed.

Anything I’m doing now is nowhere near as bad as how I was living before"
You are not alone
I'm happy i gave you some relief
Too bad that i generally only have this ability to positively impact other people when i'm medicated
"Without meds, i wouldn't bother writing this post and i wouldn't also be able to write as eloquently and assertively"
"That's what meds do for me, it's very special."
"Chances are that your anxiety is affecting your sleep and, as consequence, your energy levels"
"Propranolol only treats physical symptoms, it doesn't provide emotional, mental relief"
I'd suggest you to check the possibility of getting off propranolol and getting a medication to address your anxiety
"But obviously, i don't know you"
This is just what i think based on our very short conversation.
"Yes, maybe!"
It's been good actually
The only thing i've been overlooking are vitamins and minerals
But i'll get on that
"Vyvanse in Brazil has 3 presentations: 30, 50 and 70"
I have bottles of 30 and 50mg
"I take 30mg in days in some occasions, like: when i feel 30 is enough; when i for some reason don't take it in the morning and it's late enough for 50 long-lastness to affect my sleep at night; when i run out of stimulation and i need to redose(at night)"
"But as i said, it's just occasional"
I normally will take my 50mg pill
"When i say i took 60mg, it means i took 2 pills of 30mg"
And i think you got it wrong
I don't regularly take 60 to overcome days i'm down
"It was the case today bcs i only had 30mg pills where i was.

Yeah, i'm aware i'm no expert, but i am ok with giving myself freedom to play with doses, how i use, etc"
I'm ok with it.
"Any tips on how to stop, hahaha"
"Best I've cone up with so far is to say out loud ""I've become distracted."" then try and figure out what I was supposed to be doing, then say ""3 2 1 go"""
It amazes me how different everyone's experience is
"This is my 11th year taking stims, and i can honestly say i've never had trouble falling asleep"
"If it takes 4-5 hours to fall off, you'll definately want to time it right so that you're not interfering with your normal sleep cycle"
"That pretty much the only help i can give you, which im sure you are well aware."
"To be very clear: I normally do not sleep well, even if I can manage to sleep several hours"
"So when I do, it’s always surprising and is usually because my body basically just gives out"
As weird as that is.
"Man, i am really sorry that you have to go through this"
"I don't know how to best advise you, since i don't know much about your enviroment"
"But if you feel like you need advice, feel free to talk to me privately"
"I love to help people with these struggles, because i know how hard it can be.

As for the coping mechanisms, i need you to tell me what are your struggles"
"Studying, schedules, tasks, socializing? What is it?"
"Oh yeah before I was on meds but in the process of getting diagnosed, it felt so great to be able to point out to myself that the thing I do, how I  react, etc is ok, my brain is different"
I am on meds now and it is still good to look at my life (past and current) and say yeah makes sense
"

Meds have especially helped my emotional regulation and anxiety"
"However, I still have a very hard time getting my life together"
"I know meds aren't magic, and it makes sense I have never had good habits but dammit I'm terrible at life"
And I feel bad about that a lot
I know I need to find a therapist but when I go looking for one I manage to think myself out of a decision.
Same
It's good to know there are doctors that care tho!
Yeah BC was a nightmare for me too
I was just dead inside among other things
I'm okay with feeling a little off during my period but I think there's other things going on because I feel way more than a little off
Like can't keep a job
It sucks doesn't it
"In the instructions/warning documentation for mine (generic lisdex), it literally says in one place you can mix with orange juice and in another it says avoid vitamin C"
So yeah very contradictory.
"Wait, Lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse) is more present in your urine if you consume acids, so basically whenever you urinate, you’re removing more from your body, so it’s less effective"
"Or at-least I thought, correct me if I’m wrong."
"Okay for sure? Because I’ve been questioning this for myself, I take vitamin c/iron/b12 at night, I’ve been avoiding any acidic foods in the morning, and I’m still feeling like my meds hardly work"
Will have to experiment with might night time vitamins I guess
That makes sense that you'd carry stress through sleep
Thanks.
"In that case, I really just need to get on actual anxiety meds already!

My sleep is awful because I’m in a constant stressed state because I’m working through some big things in therapy and I just struggle so much with everything right now because my ADHD is practically unmedicated because my meds don’t seem to be doing much and other techniques aren’t very effectively lately"
"It’s all just a worsening cycle! At least some of my stressors are just future things, so, one way or another, I just have to get through for the time being.

I so often forget to prioritize my sleep"
Thank you for the reminder!
What med do you take for anxiety if you don’t mind my asking
REM sleep is required to flush the brain fluid of its toxicity.
For me personally it's more when I sleep not how much I sleep
"Waking up at 7? Doesn't matter if I got 8 or 9 hours, I'm tired"
"Waking up at 1 PM? 4 hours is plenty, thank you very much!"
"So repairing sleep is what happens when I go to sleep past 5 AM and wake up around noon.

Unfortunately I can't afford that :/"
"I know, I was being slightly too sarcastic perhaps."
I’m honestly not 100% certain what the root is
"I’m already on anti anxiety meds that help with the anxiety, but so far nothing has helped with sleep"
I’ve had so many prescriptions for both conventional and unconventional meds to try for it and so far nothing.
Unfortunately not
They usually make me more tired but still unable to sleep
I’ve tried several prescription and OTC options.
Yes! Any of the images on Google images if you look up “CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers” would be good
Most of them will be generic names of drugs
Lots of antibiotics and antifungals on there
Before taking any drug I’d recommend looking up drug interactions and making sure you are not combining two that can potentially cause more side effects or toxicity.
No they haven’t
"Grapefruit warnings are still on some drug labels, specifically some drugs metabolized by CYP3A4"
"Some prescribing info may even say how much juice you can safely drink (<1 quart, simvastatin for example)"
Yup
"Sadly, this was often my unintentional way of managing adhd before I knew I had adhd"
I’m sure I’m paying for it now.
"yes exactly, i take that med only for panic and high heart rate"
"I am bipolar though too, so my depression can be very severe and paralyzing"
That is why my meds don’t always “work” consistently
I’m usually too depressed to get up and actually build the momentum
I think minerals are the most important part in my experience.
you guys do it different in your country then
none of my business really
 just avoid going above 60 is my best advice.
I say things out loud all that time while grocery shopping
It keeps me more focused on what I need.
but I'm also usually not doom scrolling there lol 
I'm going to try your approach
"I did set timers one day every so often that would say "" do something "" "" be productive,"" "
But then I felt like I was being told so I no longer had any desire to even do it
"


If you figure it out, please let me know 🙏"
Yeah fortunately I don't have trouble falling asleep most of the time and I take them early enough that I feel fine when it's time to go to sleep
"I have only been taking meds for 2 months or so and at first the evening restlessness was very noticeable, but it's gotten much better now so maybe it will gradually fade"
"Some days my brain just doesn't want to quiet down, but it was like this already before meds so I'm not complaining."
Thank you so much
"
I excel in my professional life"
Just my personal one is crumbling.
"If you dump Adderall into a glass of orange juice, it will react and become much less effective"
Lisdexamphetamine won't do that
"

But.."
High levels of citric acid in your blood/liver does speed up amphetamine elimination from your body
That applies to both Adderall and vyvanse
It's generally a small enough effect that it can be ignored though
"

(Any pharmacists or similar please feel free to correct me)"
So basically don’t urinate.
Idk how true this is.
but apparently Methylphenidate runs out of your system quicker if you are urinating more often.
I drink like 7 liters of water a day and am constantly peeing… wasn’t aware this was a thing
Is this definitely correct? If so I think I need to tone it down a bit shit!
Absolutely
I don't drink orange juice and only eat foods with vitamin c in the afternoon/evening
"Lately, I've been trying to improve my sleep"
"Taking vitamin c in the early evening helps, but then the next morning, my adderall dose is much less effective."
This thread is stressing me out.
Focus on having good sleep and you will go far in your life
Gl mate
"Mate, i've been exactly where you are now"
"""It's a cycle..."" it's exactly where i was a few months ago"
"If you suffer from anxiety, get on meds asap"
"The earlier you get on it, the earlier you will realize it was what you've been missing your whole life"
"

I started taking mirtazapine a few weeks ago, it's for sleep and anxiety"
"Without anxiety now, i get refreshing sleep almost always and with better sleep, my life got stupidly, arrogantely, hugely, enormously, immensely better."
It's not a problem at all! I take mirtazapine 15mg
What's it that you're taking?
"That's awful, I'm sorry about that. "
"I do tend to do this with most/all drugs, just found it interesting that the caffeine/anti-fungal combo didn't flag anywhere, yet anecdotally (i.e"
looking at reddit)  it appeared to be a wildly common issue
How so?
"Oh, i see"
"I will not suggest anything here, bcs i don't know much about bipolar"
But everything i told you about resilience is still valid
"Work your stress and anxiety, that will allow you to tolerate difficult moments better"
"Much love, mate."
"No, don't worry"
I didn't take anything you said negatively
I'm sure you just wanna help and i'm thankful for your inputs!
The only thing that I've really had any luck with is continuously coming up with novel ways to keep me on a task
"Pomodoro, visual timers, white noise, postit notes.."
"Just keep cycling through them, accepting when one has worn out and trying to comes up with another one"
"If I remember correctly:

Blood's pH is unaffected by food"
If that would be possible we'd all be dead
"

Orange / grapefruit / lemon 's citric acid could interfere with absorption of some medications by changing the acidity in the gastrointestinal tract"
"When that's the case, that med comes with the warning, for example, not to eat grapefruit"
Can't remember if that's the case with ADHD meds (which is silly since I'm on vyvanse myself)
"""now that I'm on meds I can finally remember to drink enough water..."
"Oh no"""
"Dunno about you but I’m also realizing that having any caffeine basically just makes me pee out most of my vyvanse even if I wait an hour or two to drink it, cuz of the diuretic effect"
Ugh.
Nooo
You take it at night? Does it work through the next day?
"For anxiety I’m taking propranolol (only thing that’s ever helped with that), for ADHD I’m taking Dextroamphetamine"
I’m not currently taking anything for sleep but that’s mostly cause I’m still trying to find something I haven’t tried at all or at least in a few years.
Double checked myself
Urine pH is what affects amphetamine excretion
"If your urine is more acidic (which citric acid will cause), you will pee out more amphetamine"
"It's unlikely that you will consume enough citric acid to change it by more than a couple of percent though.

Adderall uptake is limited by citric acid in the intestines"
Vyvanse is not noticeably
"

It's best for some but grapefruit will fuck every medication"
It's not just citric acid
Grapefruit interferes with drug metabolism in multiple ways
"Lol, its still the opposite for me, it hasn't changed that aspect one bit, stimulants have felt like a mood stabilizer for me more than anything.."
"I still have to remember to take lunch on time, drink water regularly, brushing my teeth hasn't gotten easier either lol"
"Yes, at night"
"

>Does it work through the next day?

Wdym?"
Propranolol only relieves physical anxiety and you probably don't take it for sleeping also
"If you have mental anxiety, if you have stress going on, that will affect your sleep"
"If that's the case, you probably need serotonin meds."
Careful with these
"Works for some, yes"
Can be a short term fix (feels great at first!) that over time becomes more and more problematic.
I’m kind of a complex situation
"Between ASD and ADHD (both late diagnosed) and other things, I’ve tried so many anti anxiety meds over the years and none of them had any impact at all on my anxiety"
Propranolol has been the only thing that’s helped at all
Usually the only times now that my anxiety becomes unmanageable is when it’s being directly caused by a RSD spiral or something circumstantial
"Nothing has ever seemed to “quiet” my mind though, anxiety or otherwise"
It’s always a bee hive with every bee flying 100 mph to and from other hives
But that’s another issue altogether.

Do you also have a background dialog when you’re on autopilot?

"I relate! I do hyperfocus on specific snack/food brands but it only lasts a week or max a month, then I never want to touch it again"
So much food has gone bad because I suddenly no longer want it at all
Like to the point of even if I was hungry I wouldn’t want it
I am simultaneously very picky with food and not picky at all.
"I'm more lazy than being bored, so if I have to eat, I usually find myself eating the fastest thing I can make"
Usually this results in some bread slices
"Tbf, I am one of the opposite people"
"If they food isn't completely unhealthy, and I like it, I can eat it for like a week."
"I will find a meal, cook it for weeks and then be absolutely sick of it and need a change"
I'm in that transition right now
Couldn't figure out a lunch for the week so I'm eating out at work....sucks cuz I'm trying to lose weight but food is such a struggle.
Yes
I’ll hyper fixate on certain foods for a week or two then avoid it entirely for months cos it started to repulse me
"If there were a pill I could take at every meal time with all of the nutrients included and hunger satiated, I would rarely eat actual food."
"Yep, this is me too"
"It sucks, because I’m cooking for my entire autistic/ADHD family (husband and kids- and god this subreddit is goddamn fucking obnoxious about the n-d-t word) and every single one of us prefers different foods and dislikes different ingredients"
"There are about two dozen meals that all of us like and will eat, and everyone else would be happy if I just made those things over and over, but I get SO BORED with them, and then trying to find new dishes that cater to everyone’s needs is overwhelming AF"
The struggle is real.
I think this is more of an autism trait than an ADHD trait
"I have ADHD+autism and if it were up to me, I would eat the same thing every day"
"However, I'm very careful with my comfort food because I was addicted to Hawaiian pizza, then one day I suddenly hated it for like 5 years before I could eat it again"
So I need to keep comfort foods for the days that I reaaaaally don't feel like eating
Right now for me it's subway.
heavy on the not eating it even if i’m hungry
"if i don’t have a taste for a specific food, even if i technically like it, it’s like i can’t even keep it down."

I am stuck.

"🫂
 Having lived through and still living through what you describe, I have only one piece of advice to offer.
One step at a time"
"
Life will feel overwhelming"
Just one step at a time makes it a little easier
"
I wake up and all I focus on is making the first cup of coffee"
The rest of the day will happen there will be things to do
But that one step helps and then the next and so on
"Somewhere along the way through the day I manage to interact with people, do what I can at work and I find that I have lived through another day.
And in all that you will find that along the way you will meet some nice people to call friends, find a few things that spark some fleeting moments of pleasure"
It may not sound much but it will do
"
Society will tell you it does not meet the standard of a life well lived but that does not matter"
It is a life well lived today as compared to yesterday
"
It is positive that you have a diagnosis earlier in life"
Speak to your doctor to find medication that suits
It may not help with the depression or the feeling of being lost and adrift but it might help you function
"
Hang in there"
It's a slow journey but it is worth it.

"also a job where u are up and active helps a lot, personally i can’t do desk jobs or sitting all day and i like cars so now im a second year mechanics apprentice."
Are you on medications?
[deleted]
I wouldn’t bank on medication recommendations from Reddit
Speak with a medical professional if you believe meds will be helpful
Look for a job you love and are good at
Bonus if it pays well
Considered a trade?
Interesting
Are you an active person? Because I'd rather do a desk job because even using public transport makes me tired
But maybe a combination of active &passive could be nice
Not anymore
 I used to take escitalopram
"Yes, I love art and illustration"
 Turning it from a hobby to a job didn't really help
I've been illustrating the same book for 8 months now coz there's no strict deadline .That's what procrastination does to me

I think I just don't know how to do that
Where to find it
Seems I'm not qualified enough for anything
"No , I have zero knowledge about trading."

"but idk, find what works for u, the best way i find is do smthn ur passionate abt"
Strong suggestion to get on Vyvanse or concerta - or if you have no addictions to substances or food..Adderall XR
Thank you! I'll look into that

"Yep! I've been on meds for a couple of years now and I had to take a month break cos of the shortage last year.


I felt terrible like I couldn't do anything except sit on my ass playing video games. 


Part of accepting your adhd is accepting it's a real disorder or whatever, that you need help with"
The meds are the help and it's okay to need them! 
I can relate
I have been on medication since childhood but had zero idea what having adhd meant
I had zero support other than being forced to take medication
I didn’t even know it was a disability and I could have researched how to help myself
Now I am an adult in college and I am terrified of not having access to my prescriptions for some reason or another
"I am only alive and functioning because of my adhd medication, anti-anxiety meds, and anti-depressant"
I can’t go through not being able to do laundry for two months again or even worse a shortage of my medication could mean I drop out of college or fail important exams
I feel you.
"currently off the meds because i didn’t have the money to go to the psychiatrist’s and get a refill and then i got overwhelmed by other tasks (not more important ones necessarily but more urgent ones, so in my mind they always get priority)"
"i was more than fine, doing great even, when i could fill my days however i wanted (learnt a bunch of new skills, honed some older skills, read quite a bit, went down a couple physics rabbit holes and an oceanic biology phase, learnt a lot and produced a lot basically)"
"the second i went back to work and got flooded with strict schedules and deadlines and unclear instructions with no explanation why the damn thing needs doing in the first place, i became miserable"
it was instantaneous
"as i type this i have been crying for 5 hours straight because i’ve had to do something new today the process of which was excruciating, and i did it wrong and no one will tell me why it’s wrong, what to do instead, nor give me any example of a pre-existing similar thing"
luckily i run on spite and they’ve just made me real angry so i’ll be fine
anyway i feel you all
"For me, before meds, I used anxiety to push myself to get things done"
"The anxiety gave me adrenaline to push through my ADHD deficits.

Since starting meds, my anxiety has gone down and I manage my ADHD deficits in a healthier way"
So the anxiety isn't there waiting if I skip a day or two or three
"

This means I actually function worse on ""days off"" than I did before meds"
"The anxiety was like a type of coping mechanism, and now I don't have that coping mechanism anymore.

But I have no doubt: if I were off meds long term, the anxiety would return completely"
And I'd function like I did before meds.

Diagnosed Yesterday

I would say that’s normal
You may find your emotions sway between feeling affirmed and sad
"I found that it was almost like mourning for me, I was grieving all of the times I could’ve had help and could’ve stopped blaming myself for things out of my control if only I was diagnosed sooner"
"

There’s such a lovely community with ADHD but reactions to diagnoses aren’t the same for everyone"
"I definitely did feel sadness, so I know what you mean."
"Thanks for taking the time to reply! 

I’m finding I’m doing exactly that, replaying things from years ago"
"

I find that I have quite a good self-esteem"
I do like who I am and where I am in life
"But I still feel regret, confusion etc"
"over events in my life.

I’m someone who for most of my adult life has been on some kind of medication for anxiety and depression - which looking back looks like a misdiagnosis for what should have been ADHD"
"I think my ADHD symptoms were the root cause.

I wish I could go back and just give the younger me a hug and tell him it’s not his fault."

adhd meds help pls

"You should directly speak to your therapist about it because he is the only one who can arbitrate the risks.

Nonetheless 5mg methylphenidate is a very low dosage, wouldn't be surprised you would have to increase the dosage to get some benefits.

If you have several comorbidities (which is not rare), therapist are usually extra careful with dosage to assess side effects"
It sounds like it's wearing off too fast due to the small dose
"Treatment can be such a minefield to navigate, but it's worth it in the long run!"
"For reference, I am on methylphenidate too, started with 10mg XR (so same dosage as you as it is composed of 2 releases of 5 mg) and I had effects on the first day but almost none on the following days, with the minimal effects wearing off extremely fast.

It indeed was just that the dosage was too low, now on 30 mg + 20 mg and it works like a charm.

At least, if you got benefits on the first day, it means you respond to methylphenidate, it is just that your therapist is doing a careful titration."

Why not just take another dose of Vyvanse on afternoon?
"the duration is really not the issue entirely but is at the same time because my days tend to be longer then 10-12 hours and that's about how long it last if I take two doses I feel like I wouldn't be able to sleep
Well, that's why I was considering Mydayis as an option."
I see
I take 2x70mg and 1x40mg/ day to last for 15-16h
"Sleep in general is okay, some nights might be a bit difficult to fall asleep but worth it."

sleeping? what is that?

I feel you
My sleep schedule is a wreck too
So inconsistent
I've just accepted that this is my life lol
"But on a serious note, try to trick your brain"
"get sunshine in hours you want to stay awake and limit blue light at hours you want to sleep.

Try to close off your windows when sleeping too and when you wake up in open the lights"
This can really help you manage your sleep schedule and achieve being a morning person
"This needs to be consistent, it's still taking me months to stick to it but I've been loving my routine lately so I'm trying my best to stay consistent"
Good luck OP!
I think it sounds diet related
"Do you eat a lot of refined carbs, sugar and or caffeine?"
i eat a lot of junk food daily and i have since i was 12 but this whole sleep schedule started after i turned 18😭
Do a carnivore diet
Your body will thank you
Check Dr.Anthony Chaffee

should i switch to vyvanse?

"One of the most important things when trying medication is to be patient and try all options with one medication before moving to the next one.

27 mg may not be good for you, but you have to try it and know for a fact that it's not good, so you have no self-doubt six months later about it.

You don't need to try it for months, but I will say two weeks is more than enough to know if it's making any difference, even a slight one."
"I’ve tried concerta, then switched to Vyvanse"
I’ve found them both equally effective for my ADHD-I symptoms but the Vyvanse has a somewhat slower uptake and a much longer duration; so much so that it was interfering with my sleep
"
Around the same time the manufacturer was prohibited from making more, so it was getting scarce"
My doctor suggested switching again to generic dexadrine
He says that Vyvanse is essentially dextros with an added enzyme to prolong release
"We could dial in the dosage so it stopped interfering with my sleep, which worked great, and was much much cheaper."
ive finished a bottle and a half of 36mgs i think i gave it a fair chance
it works for getting things done but im still very hyper or at least my mind is
"after i experienced a truly clear mind for the first time, my none stop thoughts abt usless bs are annoying and exhausting"
idk if 27mg would be enough to get things done and quiet my brain
"Fair enough, like you said, 27 mg may not do much for you"
"Often, the wrong medication gives you more side effects with few benefits"
"But it's safer to remove doubts and test things before coming to a conclusion.

From my limited experience, I have tried my medication with multiple doses, high and low, with food, without, with protein, etc., until I found a good average"
"But sometimes that average is not enough, so that's the time to try new medication"
But at least I felt i tried everything before
"Sadly, doctors or pharmacists don't even tell you all of this  "" thanks reddit """

I finally finished the thing I've been putting off for months!

"Tbh the only things which remain stimulating to me once the novelty has worn off (they become less stimulating when it's worn off but they still provide some), are outdoor things where there's adrenaline involved and I get to explore lots of new places/routes.

Hiking, running and climbing have been 3 of the only hobbies I've been able to keepnlong term as they let me explore places, challenge myself and release endorphins and sometimes adrenaline"
"(At least I think that's the reason).

I've never been able to stick at anything indoors myself unfortunately, I really have tried so many things but none stick if they're indoor or involve sitting still."
Maybe you should do cooking classes then ? It’s fun you can do them alone or with friends although I guess they would be pricier than just doing it at home.

Help! How do I meal plan

"I was obese and struggled w boredom eating all my life - potato chips, candy, all those high reward binge foods, I could never get myself to portion control"
"As soon as I started taking meds, I was finally able to actually stop eating when I was full, and potato chips don’t taste as addicting to me anymore"
I feel like I have more choice over what to eat rather than just being forced by my lizard brain
Both straterra and adderall helped with this (the two meds I’ve been taking back and forth) so I imagine most of them would
" So if you aren’t medicated already, maybe meds might help?

I would also say if it’s too hard to get yourself to eat meals over snacks, just try having healthier snacks around, like Greek yogurt, veggies (I like pre-cut cauliflower and Greek yogurt mixed with ranch powder, it tastes JUST like ranch dressing), etc"
"Can you meal prep for only your partner, and give yourself some more flexibility w eating?

For me, I end up meal prepping bc of time and money constraints"
It puts enough stress on me thinking abt it that I actually can force myself to eat the food I don’t rly like or come up with meals in advance bc I just feel so stressed out imagining the alternative.
"Your question is about meal planning, which I have found to be difficult too"
"AI is a controversial tool, but one thing I find it pretty good for is meal planning"
"For a while now I've been playing with prompts like ""design a two-week meal plan for a man of certain age and weight  include X ingredients, X amount of fiber and protein, three meals and two snacks a day"" There are even public food calorie databases AI has access to if you want to count calories"
"You don't have to follow it verbatim, if nothing else it can inspire ideas for your own plans."
Thank you for your reply
I am trying to incorporate healthier snacks but still find myself grabbing potato chips and things for that buzz like you say
"
I am in the UK and it's massively long wait lists for medication, I haven't been medicated since I was 16"
"I have considered it for a long time.

I wonder if anyone has tried mounjaro/ other weight loss options and whether this was positive / negative
 experiences alongside the ADHD"
I'm willing to give it a try for sure
"
I think my issue though, which I couldn't articulate, isn't that I can't make a meal plan."
I can do that part..
"its the following it through, I would not want the things I'd planned, I'd change my mind all the time and then ultimately end up wasting food.

The current method of deciding on the day is costing me a fortune also.

I'll try this method and see if I can train my brain and stick to it for the end results"
"I think that's another issue, I live for instant gratification so if I eat well for a day, I'm utterly shocked when I don't wake up the next day at my goal weight lol joking, sort of..but That does then make me think of this one little thing won't hurt and before I know it"
I've had 10 bad things
"That’s valid, the only thing that worked for me without meds is just not buying any of the snacks at all 😭😭 when nothing in the house is yummy then you have no choice but to only eat when hungry…"
"I always break and end up buying some every now and then though, but it definitely helped overall to consciously avoid buying it"
"

I also really like bagged salads; I’m in US but I imagine they have them over there as well? It’s quite possibly the quickest thing to make ever, makes no dishes if you eat it out of the bag, and since it’s a salad if you reduce the dressing a little you have enough calories space for some potato chips or a snack on the side, so that has been a go-to for me ever since I started watching my food, too.

Is mounjaro like ozempic? I imagine that it would work even with adhd, since I believe they are appetite suppressants? So it’s definitely an option"
"But personally, I would be too scared just bc I know if the lifestyle choices aren’t there then the weight won’t stay off and I don’t trust myself like that 😭"
"Thanks again for replying.

My problem when I do this, is I become obsessed then with wanting something and then over indulge.."
"maybe it's less to do with the ADD and more to do with food addiction 🤔

We do have bagged salads, I could live off bagged salads"
"It's then the cooking for my daughter and partner but I guess, I just need to maybe just get In the habit of having something different to them and finding"
"Like a bagged salad, something easy for me and no prep time needed"
"

I have incorporated working out in the last month around 4x a week, where as before I was doing nothing, so that's good."
Thats understandable! It does sound like maybe a bit of a food addiction but I think that’s SUPER common among adhd folks since adhd makes us more addiction prone
The thing is tho- it’s okay to overindulge sometimes
"You only need a *net* deficit of calories, so if you can make it 6 days with no cheating and then have one cheat day, maybe you will still be making progress"
"It’s better to do something you can sustain (like working in some cheat days) than to do something impossible! 

It sounds like maybe having healthier and easier options for yourself might work well"
"Since your daughter and partner aren’t trying to lose weight, it also makes sense to me that you’d want to feed yourself separately"
"Personally, I’m going to be making meals for both me and my gf once we move next month, and I already know I’ll be cooking separately bc she is underweight, and I am verging on overweight"
I’ll be putting lots of butter in her half and using cooking spray on mine 😂😂

"i can relate, idk if it’s connected with adhd but i feel like i get cold so easily probably cuz i live in cali but i feel like anything under 75 degrees is like chilly to me, but if it’s over 80 i’m sweating like a dog"
it’s annoying when my friends would see me with a sweater or hoodie on and repeatedly ask me “how are you not hot right now?” like bro i’m cold
"also i’ve noticed that certain medications can cause your feet and hands to be really cold, and your feet for some reason decides if you feel cold thru out ur body."
IDK is it's related to ADHD cz I have a high cold tolerance
Definitely no correlation from my side
I'm able to tolerate both
Obviously sucks to be walking around sweaty in summer but no particular hate towards heat
"Ha yup, that's me ""How are you not hot right now?""

What's weird is my feet and hands don't get cold - it's more my shoulder/upper back area for some reason."
Ah I meant to include general tempereature sensitivity
"Are you someone who's possibly the opposite, where you're intolerant of heat?"
Yes kinda..
But I don't think it's problematic for me...

Hi! Im also diagnosed recently and started taking 10mg each 4 hours
"It also makes me sweat cold, anxious and lose appetite but kinda quiet in the head.

You may wanna speak to your psychiatrist since you experience severe side-effects and don’t get the effect you need"
The same medication may effect different people differently
"So maybe you will find one that will benefit you more with less side-effects.

I think everyone with ADHD that uses a pill organiser got one after a similar mistake haha
"or just take a mega-dose of Vitamin C :)

""**AI Overview**

Yes, you should take Adderall and vitamin C at least one hour apart because vitamin C can reduce the absorption of Adderall into your body: 

* **Explanation**Vitamin C is an acidifying substance that can affect how much Adderall is absorbed and removed from the body. This can make Adderall less effective than usual. 
* **Recommendations**To ensure that Adderall is absorbed properly, you can take vitamin C either several hours before or after Adderall. You can also try taking the medication on an empty stomach. 
* **Other interactions**You should also tell your doctor about all other medications you use, including vitamins and herbs. 

Adderall is a prescription medication that affects the central nervous system (CNS). It's commonly prescribed to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. """

Hi! It could be that your dose is too low
If you just started on Elvanse its pretty common they start off with the lowest dose possible
its purpose is mostly to let your body adjust to the substance and just make sure it isnt giving any terrible side effects
"

Once the body has adjusted to the lower dose it is then easier to switch to a higher dose, and the body will be able to tolerate and adjust to it better rather than if they instantly started you on a high dose

Oh and signs of it working are that maybe its easier to start on tasks, its easier to keep going through with them, you manage time better and dont feel it running away etc"
"basically if you feel any improvements, any slight improvements in your ADHD traits it means its working, but it could be that the dose is too low if you think your adhd is still disrupting your daily routine"
It's a long process getting your meds exactly right to something that works for you
My son was diagnosed in May and we are still trying to get dosing right
His will work for awhile then start losing effectiveness over time
It's very frustrating
"But talk to your doctor, this very well just may not be the proper medication for you to be on"
That or maybe the dosage is too low yet
But you have to communicate with your physician and be honest about how you're feeling so they can get your meds adjusted correctly.

Your thoughtfulness and compassion will be a massive help
Kudos to you for being proactive!
I'll try give a few tips as best as i can
"(I'm a late diagnosed 36yom+ ADHD, plus trauma through parent)  


1"
"Keep being as loving as you are.

You sound much like my wife in that she has been with me pre-diagnosis and all throughout the journey (now 3 years)"
"The best thing she has been is forgiving of me and encouraging of me to speak my actual thoughts and feelings without the fear (or at least less than before) of her getting angry and accusing me of saying/thinking something that isn't correct or shutting me out.

  
2"
"Problems

When he's coming to tell you about an issue or problem you can use the line of 'do you want advice? help? or for me to just listen?'"
Makes it easy for you because then you know your role and what he wants from you
"It's easier for him because he can now talk in a less pressured manner, and because you're actively listening and are engaged in what he's saying he's less likely to rush through or forget his point due to interruptions.

  
3"
Curiosity not judgement
"

For example"
"instead of 'why hasn't the washing been done?' you could ask 'hey, do you need help with hanging out the washing in the machine?' or ask about something in the wash"
These sort of changes will remind him of something he has probably forgotten without making it seem like you're blaming him for when the washing isn't done
"(this comes from fear of failure and people pleasing) thus avoiding the shame and perceived criticism and RSD

  
4"
"LISTS! 

Have lists or checklists wherever they can go (if you want something from the shops, write it down for us) Simple things, like 'phone, wallet, keys, drink bottle, laptop' or 'weeding, mowing, raking, watering'"
"That way he has to use less mental energy to complete tasks as it's clearly laid out and he knows what his responsibilities are.

Lastly"
show him this post as i could definitely be wrong and he doesn't want this type of help
"I feel like you would have told him about it, but it does show how much you care about being supportive of him and his struggle"
Unmasking takes a long time and it can be really fucking scary because you never know how someone is going to react
"If he had a particularly volatile and critical parent, then his RSD is most likely a trauma response and does need therapy (when he's ready).

Good luck mate, and if you have any questions, i'd love to help where i can.

(also, I'm in Australia but I'm assuming you're not?) Mental health care plans here from a GP can help significantly with subsidising the expense of a psychologist."
"Please be aware that RSD, or rejection sensitivity dysphoria, is not a syndrome or disorder recognised by any medical authority"
"

Rejection sensitivity dysphoria has not been the subject of any credible peer-reviewed scientific research, nor is it listed in the top two psychiatric diagnostic manuals, the DSM or the ICD"
"It has been propagated solely through blogs and the internet by William Dodson, who coined the term in the context of ADHD"
"Dodson's explanation of these experiences and claims about how to treat it all warrant healthy skepticism.

Here are some scientific articles on ADHD and rejection:

* [Rejection sensitivity and disruption of attention by social threat cues](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2771869/)
* [Justice and rejection sensitivity in children and adolescents with ADHD symptoms](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24878677/)
* [Rejection sensitivity and social outcomes of young adult men with ADHD](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17242422/)

Although r/ADHD's rules strictly disallow discussion of other 'popular science' (aka unproven hypotheses), we find that many, many people identify with the concept of RSD, and we have **not** removed this post"
"We do not want to minimise or downplay your feelings, and many people use RSD as a shorthand for this shared experience of struggling with emotions"
"

However, please consider using the terms 'rejection sensitivity' and 'emotional dysregulation' instead.

I’m trying Strattera now
Started on 25mg and about to go to 60mg
I don’t feel tired like I did on 30mg Vyvanse
Also Vyvanse made me extremely tired and lethargic and gave my a rapid heart rate and chest pain so I stopped it.
"personally as someone who took both medications, vyvanse and azstarys, vyvanse is much better imo, azstarys is good during the ir portion of the medication which works around 4 hours then after that wears off it made me very tired and unmotivated, personally i think you should lower your vyvanse dose and try adding a aderall booster in the afternoon for the crash."
Azstarys is similar for me compared to Vyvanse
There is a copay card you can get online or from ur doctor  that should make it about 25-50$ a month even without insurance
I had to go up to 50mg Vyvanse from 30 because the lower dosage made me have narcolepsy like symptoms
I would love you you to update me when you start taking the high dose of strattera!
"Unfortunately anything lower and I crash out almost immediately, I made a post about it some time ago"
"My doctor is deeply against stimulants so asking for a booster is a no go, plus I switched from adderall to Vyvanse because it made me have really bad palpitations and heat intolerance regardless of dosage."
Ahh I gotcha
"If you’re thinking about another long acting I’d say try concerta if youre leaning toward the methylphenidate route, I had a better experience on concerta than Azstarys, but currently vyvanse works best for me."

Pristiq is in a class of drugs called SNRIs
They are typically not the first line of treatment for depressive symptoms for this exact reason
"They are effective, but they can have very bad withdrawal symptoms.."
"People can even start to experience these kind of symptoms if they miss a dose for just one day! What you're experiencing is unfortunately normal after stopping pristiq.

You were cut down to 50mg and then told to stop all together? There is a 25mg dose which you could've tapered to for a while, and then maybe you could've even cut the 25 in half for a while"
I don't know..
I'm not a psychiatrist but 50mg to nothing seems a little abrupt for a med that is known to be difficult to stop.
"I went through the same exact thing and it was because I was coming off pristiq, once that got out of my system the adhd meds were wonderful"
Yeah it definitely sounds like you are having withdrawal from Pristiq
I’ve had this before
It’s crappy but it won’t last
Hang in there.

Study reveals social networks are not a reliable scientific source
Millions of Pikachus surprised.
"The methodology isn't that great when it comes to assessing misinformation, still TikTok is full of misinformation on ADHD but honestly it's often also pretty bad in this sub"
"As someone who teaches media literacy, social media like tiktok, Reddit, X, YouTube, and Meta information should ALWAYS be considered false until verified with alternative, credible sources"
"Any platform that is an algorithm-fed sales-machine design keep you hooked, should be met with instant and fierce distrust."
"I'm certain there is a lot of misinformation on TikTok, but I don't think the methodology is adequate here"
Checking content against a questionnaire is a self fulfilling prophecy
A lot of the videos I've seen simply show behaviors or experiences that resonate with a lot of people with ADHD
Think Connor DeWolfe and similar accounts
"These may or may not be recognized symptoms, but the reality of living with ADHD is greater than the sum of ASRS questions."
"I hate to be elitist, especially cuz I’ve been on both side of the coin when it comes to healthcare, but I fucking hate how social media (Tik Tok “content creators” being the worst offenders.) has spread so much misinformation, as well as made mental health conditions become a sort of fashion accessory for some folks."
It’s extremely annoying and feeds the “everyone’s a bit ADHD” bullshit we have to put up with
I got diagnosed by a psychiatrist because and my family is still suspicious of it
I’ve started calling out friends who say “I’m a bit ADHD too”
Enough
I’ve never been on Tik-Tok it’s demise can’t come soon enough for me.
I’m writing a paper about the misinformation going around out there and the detrimental effect it is having
Thank you for sharing
I’ll consider adding this source.
"I'd wager most of the ads that are targeting people who either have or think they have ADHD are trying to prey on feelings of insecurity, hopelessness, desperation, and impulse-buying.

They're not out there trying to be benevolent helpers for people with ADHD.

They're trying to take your money"
"

That doesn't require accuracy"
"

In fact, it's usually better for their bottom line to say whatever they think will part you with your money BECAUSE it's targeting your emotions, not your critical faculties.

I always feel like prey on TikTok when I see an ad shilling some good or service that ostensibly helps people with ADHD, and if I can block them, I usually do."
"The information I've gotten from TikTok, has led to my diagnosis"
"But I did a questionnaire I found online, I took it to my doctor, he had me do a questionnaire, and then ""wasn't surprised"" to find out that I had ADHD"
"He lives two houses down from me, and he said he saw the writing on the walls.."
For years before I spoke to him about it
"I wouldn't have known had it not been for ADHD creators on TikTok, but I don't take what they say at face value, I use it as a jumping off point for my own research."
"Anyone who thinks that any piece of information from any source of social media is something that they shouldn’t at minimum fact check, then they are gonna have a bad life"
"Most of my family is that way and the kinds of things they bring up as “factual” is not only truly shocking, but disturbing"
"I don’t understand how they can be so stupid, ignorant, or foolish"
Just adds to the list of things that makes me wonder how I can possibly be related to them.
"misinformation is for sure an issue on ALL social media, but the top 50 videos on the #adhdtest is a small sample and most people share their experiences, and that may not be on the questionaire"
the #adhdtest definitely isn't representative of the majority of ADHD tiktokers
"it also depends if theyre counting ppls indiv experiences as ""misleading"" based on their factors.

misinformation is a HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGE problem esp any social media that includes any kind of algorithm  but this study isn't very good unfortunately"
esp bc top videos also tend to be the most controversial ones so im curious what the comment sections on those posts were like
"just seems like its gonna be used to call anybody sharing their experiences as spreading misinfo or fake claiming ppl which i've seen after similar studies came out and people just ran with the headlines and the percentages without thinking about the sample sizes

ETA: there for sure needs to be studies on this kinda thing with better methodology and hopefully across other platforms as well including reddit"
Imagine thinking a test on TikTok is accurate in the first place
"Yeh, the misinformation is a huge problem"
In some ways I also wonder if the huge number of people with brain damage from COVID are why we’re seeing these increases in people seeking diagnoses for both ADHD and autism
"There is so much overlap of symptoms at the surface level… then when you factor in the reductive descriptions across social media that are pathologizing personality traits and quirks, people begin to identify with those conditions."
Maybe it’s time to update the assessment tool and or diagnostic criteria.
"I made a post about this a week ago here, but it didn’t get posted.

It’s really disappointing"
It’s frankly an insult to those of us who struggle with the condition.
A LOT of the information about ADHD on TikTok is actually talking about diagnostic criteria for autism
And people get so mad when you say that because they couldn't possibly relate to autistic traits...
"No shit, that’s why I am from that you should not (and can not in any official capacity) state you have adhd if you don’t have a medical diagnosis"
It’s repulsive tbh
Shocking
I avoided tiktok from day one for a reason
"Weird there would be misinformation on a social media platform owned by PRC with a ton of ignorant, uneducated, flakey westerners on it."
Isn't this true about everything on TikTok? The crap people spout never ceases to amaze me
"I've been in HR and recruiting for 15 years and people with like five years of experience as a project manager at Google have hundreds of thousands of followers and know the ""secrets"" to getting your ""next six figure job"" and they are giving out DANGEROUS advice."
Pretty terrible study to use 50 videos and call it good
Even if they're the most popular ones
"Especially since there will be 50+ million views on a few videos, but most people will have just seen that a couple times"
"The ones people see consistently are the somewhat lower consistent videos since the algorithm will feed more frequent videos rather than the same big ones to people who are interested.

Bad methodology imo to get the clickbait title"
Half of tiktok are false things..good thing I don't use it :)
"Misinformation on Tik Tok? Wait, I thought the Terms of Service says you can't say anything true on that platform??"
is losing stuff a diagnostic criteria ? I think I might be the only person who doesn't lose objects
"I lose friends, jobs, partners and my emotions but stuff, no."
Literally the main reason you can't talk about ADHD without feeling like an asshole
People either think ADHD is some madeup shit nobody has or you're just a self diagnosed victim card player
Wish I had a premade response for people talking shit about ADHD because it happened to me many times and usually I don't say anything at all and keep it to myself
Having mental illnesses is obviously trendy
It's wild
"Worked with kids and teens once, and one of the girls wanted so bad to have borderline"
She had seen #bpd all over tiktok
"She could accept bipolar too, it was cool"

"That's what we got today.

Girls going on SoMe talking about their anxiety about everything"
It's normal feelings
Nobody feels great all the time
But when you focus too much on it it becomes your identity
I think it's sad
So many young people are disabled
"I think it's becoming an epidemy.

It's not ok for children to feel discomfort, teacher can't even ask what they did in their summer vacation, because others might be sad that they didn't go to Disney land"
"Well, I remember when that happened, I wasn't sad, I thought lucky them"
"I was home, and it was great! And what happens when kids grow up, protected from everything, they can't face the real life"
"They quit their jobs because the boss want them to do things different, they say they're bullied by co workers because some of them are better friends"

And those adhd girls, because it's most girls, are you trying to get attention? Are you trying to have excuses for bad thing you do? And those videos claiming everything is related to their diagnose"

Super interesting
Thank you for sharing!
"While the methodology is certainly questionable, therefore the results can't be generalized, it is still undeniable that there is a lot of misinformation on Tiktok, or personal experiences that people extrapolate or mislabel as symptoms."
This methodology kind of sucks
"So many people who have been diagnosed with adhd have been very vocal about the limitations and inadequacies of current formalized testing, and that’s the rubric they used here to assess validity of info online"
"That’s not to say there isn’t a ton of misinformation about adhd on socials, bc of course there is"
But this is just a bad way to accurately measure it.
Mmm I wonder why this subreddit has quadrupled in the past couple years? 😅 Could it be that TikTok made millions of people think they have ADHD? 🤣
I have an issue with this
I am a nurse who reads studies regularly for funsies
"

It doesn't sound fun atm because I'm currently ""bleaching"" my stairs so I can get the perfect stain color"
"

But perhaps I'll read it later"
"

My issue though is this, studies can only study what they've already studied about ADHD and they have fucking NOT properly studied ADHD"
"Nor have they properly studied ADHD in women, which is a whole other monster"
"

So, no offense to the OP intended whatsoever"
"

But I'm callin horseshit at this moment"
"

Yes' this stance is prior to reading this specific study."
Yeah
No shit
  Z
"It's an absolute cancer hole.

The only valid information I could get from tiktok is people to avoid in real life."
Meh
"It was still accurate enough to lead me to seek a diagnosis and treatment, and was more accurate than a lot of outdated seo'd articles and overly chippy unhelpful youtube videos."
But you can bet your ass this is what people base their opinions and beliefs on
I wanna be a scientist and make these breakthroughs
I had this argument about tumblr back in the day when “no woman has a flat stomach that’s your uterus!!” was hashtag body positivity.

[deleted]
"TikTok is basically the same as AI - it's more about what SOUNDS right than what is actually right

we're living in times where the truth isn't as important as what people feel could be the truth sadly..."
If you think ADHD info is bad on TikTok and reddit you should also browse the autism sub reddit...
Can you please send some links of misinformation?
The methodology of this paper is honestly dog shit
"It likely only took a couple days to do the ""research"" and write the paper"
"This paper reads like something an undergrad turns in for a grade, not something that should be published in a journal.

TikTok is NOT a good source of information about ADHD"
This paper is also hot garbage
Both statements can be simultaneously true.
"The problem is that a lot of those ""common experiences"" have nothing to do with ADHD and/or would not be explained by the way ADHD affects the brain."
I have seen this study posted in a few places and am honestly baffled by the methodology
"

I actually think a study explicitly comparing similarity of content in the #ADHDtest hashtag to content of the ASRS (which is sort of what they seem to have actually been measuring without saying so) could have been quite interesting if it had reached statistical significance, since it would suggest the hashtag actually might have some screening validity"
"Based on the results though they were obviously overwhelmingly dissimilar, which I guess is less interesting (but also not very surprising, but also not very publishable).

But in comparison it seems kind of unhinged and ironically kind of clickbaity to classify everything non-ASRS as *misleading*"
"Even in a low-impact journal I find it a bit alarming that this made it past multiple reviewers.

Interestingly enough a brief look at the tag ""ADHD *screening*"" (though weirdly not so much ""ADHDscreening"" with no space) looks to me like it actually might pass a similarity test against the ASRS, though I haven't run any statistical tests on it to prove it (and won't be doing so, because that way hyperfocus lies and I need to go and have dinner haha)"
"What did they expect? That every video on a social media platform, where people share their experiences, would be 50 people reading out the same sterile ass questionnaire?"
"A friend of mine (she also has ADHD-C) said ""An ADHD 'label' has become the new bad back"" what she means is most feel it's easy to label themselves but hard for others to prove they are lying"
"Especially here in UK, 'fake' mental health self diagnosis is rife."
"Everyone poops, but if you poop 20x a day, every day by default, it's a problem"
"

""I have constant pooping disorder, diagbised as CPoopD and am medicated to poop way less but still poop more than most"" 


Friend: ""yeah I am a bit CPoopD  too""


""You mean sometimes you poop? That's called being normal, I take medication every day just so I can get close to being a bit CPoopD and even then, I'm likely still out pooping you on your worst days"""
I actually finally got the courage to ask for diagnosis again after seeing so many people talk about it on Tik Tok
"If it wasn't for Tik Tok, I wouldn't be diagnosed right now"
We also don't need psychiatrists to tell us who we are or to know our assessments of ourselves are valid
Self diagnosis is valid if you've actually done the research
"Thinking you're ""a bit ADHD"" is still very silly though."
Theres a fuck ton of scams out there targeting us and other disabled folks
So so so many ads on tiktok its ridiculous
Blocking is for sure the way to go
"
And i feel similarly about folks tryna take advantage, or rage baiters too"
I feel like those kinda things would be shown in top videos
"And just using the #adhdtest for videos feels weird
But back to the point yes you're so right and its an issue thats affecting a lot of communities"
"The money above all hustle mentality type of thing, and they will say that theyre selling the definitive thing to help with adhd or with autism or anxiety or ocd or whatever the person decides to exploit.
I think there needs to be some decent plain language like things to watch out for re: scams ESP social media scams."
i had the same experience..
tiktok and instagram were the starting point.
and it's made psychologists take me less seriously bc they think i just saw a tiktok video and decided to drop 2k on an eval and not a lifelong thing ive been dealing with and doing serious research into
other folks experiences on tiktok and across the internet definitely helped me too tho
like catieosaurus i think is their name? they also do sex ed type stuff so idk if they're still on tiktok or if theyre just other places
I think right here you have also explained the big problem with this whole 'self diagnosing' thing
"People see something, relate to it (which in itself is fine), then start claiming this is what they have"
"There's a REASON medical professionals are required to diagnose these things, and that is for reasons you have said here for one, that the overlap in symptoms that go beyond just a couple other disorders, but also into lifestyles, physical issues and more"
"

And also because people are biased towards themselves when they suspect these things, but how we see ourselves is often a little different than how others see us when it comes to 'disordered' behaviour and traits"
"My psychiatrist wanted to speak to at LEAST 3 people who had known me for a long time, through various stages of my life to confirm that what I told him, even though to me it was 100% truthful, wasn't skewed by how much I related to the information he gave me when he said he suspected ADHD."
Like what? I could see the irony but it sounds like you could do some debunking videos
I’d watch them!
You said it
I agree with what you're saying
"

I also believe ADHD is a real scannably diagnosed chemical imbalance"
It's a disservice to all of us that brain scans are not the standard diagnostic tool
"

I work in Healthcare, it's a fucking joke"
"

But mental illness is real without the things that make it worse"
"

Does someone you love struggle with mental illness? Do you feel they use it as a crutch?"
"Yeah I feel like I have to fact check anything anyone says to me these days because no joke, like 75% of the time it's bullshit engagement misinformation they saw on social media somewhere"
And these are intellectual adults/peers at well paying jobs.
I must have missed it but it sounds absolutely on par.
"Not specific for ADHD, but ""How to keep house while drowning"" helped me greatly in reframing house work and accepting that it's ok to do what I can and not obsess over what is not being done."
I recommend Driven to Distraction by Edward Hallowell and John Ratey
" It was the book my son's school recommended I read*, which made me go from,  ""He's not adhd,"" to ""Holy shit"
" Not only does he have it, but so do I *and* my husband.""

*full disclosure: I only read about 3/4 of it,  which is admittedly better than my usual average with non-fiction books."
"Not sure of your gender, but Women with ADD is also a great book, especially for people with inattentive type vs hyperactivity."
Dr
"Russell Barkley, he has at least one lecture in the sidebar, and a number of others on youtube"
" His lecture on neurodevelopment in typical vs ADHD brains was deeply informative and I had probably a hundred brain explosions ;)

He has a number of books I haven't read any, but he's a career ADHD expert he's been at the forefront of it for decades."
How To ADHD's book (with the same title) is pretty good
"She's technically a youtuber, but works as hard as possible to base her videos off the current scientific consensus."
"Taking Charge of Adult ADHD: Proven Strategies to Succeed at Work, at Home, and in Relationships

I did a bunch of research and landed on this book"
Author is a researcher IRT ADHD so atleast has some initial merit there and the book was a wonderful resource when I was first getting diagnosed
(Not some woo woo pop physchology)
"Yup, but it doesn't even have to sound right, it just has to sound ""catchy"""
As someone with a legitimate bad back and ADHD it’s rather frustrating
"It makes people not believe you or care enough or take it seriously.

“Oh me too!” “ oh so you’re in constant pain every day and you forget to pay the electric bill until it’s shut off?”"
"> Friend: ""yeah I am a bit CPoopD too""

Basically them either saying 'relatable' or using a personal example to show support and empathy, which may also indicate..."
I mentioned I got diagnosed by a psychiatrist because my family members (who didn’t believe me) also didn’t really believe a qualified medical practitioner
It was more a comment on people’s perceptions rather than various paths to a diagnosis.
"I understand what you're saying but if you're speaking in terms of a medically recognised disorder, then you kinda DO need a psychiatrist to validate that.."
"Nothing wrong with suspecting you have something and using that as a tool to find ways to manage things you struggle with, but you can't technically diagnose yourself with anything"
"

But you're right, there are elements of the stuff on tiktok and such that are absolutely a benefit as they help people understand more and recognise symptoms and get an idea of what's going on and that is a good thing."
"Agree, wholeheartedly! None of us are immune to our own bias, and it becomes actively harmful when people start speaking with authority on a disorder they can’t even be certain that they have"
It just feeds into this cycle of mis- and disinformation
"

Just from my own observations, I’ve seen a general tendency online for people to lean towards disorders with less stigma as well"
Which can also be harmful to the person themselves because treatment modalities and effective management of disordered behaviours will look entirely different from one condition to the next.

"Yes I know a few, most people don't, some people do."
"I'm getting real sick of how dumb everyone is.

I mean, I'm dumb too, but I've  been sick of that for a long time."
And that makes the ADHD diagnose a joke
"When the common knowledge around ADHD is filled with misinformation, it doesn't matter that you - the person who has it - corrects it, because people have seen so much information already.

Who knows, maybe they have a little bit themselves, like everyone else."
Funny story
My husband borrowed that book from the library after he was diagnosed with ADHD
"Several years later, he took our kids to the library and he couldn’t check out a book because he still had that checked out! It was like 5 years over due! lol"
But he still knew where it was! And our library is fine-free if you return the book
:-)
"Love this book! And if I remember correctly, it has a TLDR chapter too!"
Which one? I feel like there are so many with the title.
Seriously thank you so much! I’m desperate for any accurate information haha
"> you forget to pay the electric bill until it’s shut off?”

I don't, because I have that set to autopay"
"Don't you think it's just a lack of mental health assistance? 

Well, more specifically, it's a lack of community"
"In a well functioning community, you learn what behaviors are acceptable and which are not and are encouraged.

Therapy is the same thing.."
is my point
"

Hope you're having a good night! 😊"
"While I agree with some of your statements that last sentence really seems hypocritical.

No"
"Most people don't have a ""bit of ADHD"" or ""a bit of OCD"".

These things are defined by their constant prevalence.

Most people can be distracted sometimes"
Most people can lose things
"Most people can be hyperactive sometimes.

The vast majority of people do not have a constant prevalence"
They don't have a bit of ADHD like everyone else; they have media illiteracy.
Lmao hard relate to this

They're the victims of a world with misinformation"
The last statement was sarcastic
"That was pretty obviously satirical lol, though your concerns are appreciated"
Thanks! I was hoping it was that one! I added it to my cart! I have inattentive type so it’s perfect!

"I got close, but the doc said something that pissed off my mom, and that was the end of that"
"Anyway, my parents overall were extremely loving, caring and supportive of me growing up"
"Once I was in college, and started going to the doctor by myself, they came around"
"However, the “damage” had been done"
"By that I mean, the aftermath of the ADHD symptoms that had gotten the best of me, and caused real world consequences"
"Failed college classes, credit card debt, job instability, run ins with the law, medical bills, etc"
"Like I said, overall, and especially today, my parents are my ride or die"
"Because of that, and because they can afford to, they have bailed me multiple times"
But they have certainly gotten frustrated with the financial and opportunity costs
They regret not sucking up their pride back then
"And the “best part”? My dad was an Army officer, our healthcare was covered 100%"
"I could’ve gone to any GP, Psych or Therapist I needed"
I could’ve gotten any drug I needed
Paid for 100%

Maybe 1 million
"If you think it will help, show this to your parents"
ADHD is a demon that can destroy lives. 
Get diagnosed
"

Seriously"
Your parents can deal with feeling boo boos by themselves
"

Don’t pander to your parents ignorance."
My family \*still\* roll their eyes when I talk about having ADHD and I'm 36..
"

I was only diagnosed at 32 and *FUCK* do I wish I could have been diagnosed before college and law school"
"

**No one knows what it's like inside your head** \- not even the people who created the head"
This is your call
"

Maybe there is someone at school you could talk to and who could talk to your parents? Some might say it's pretty neglectful parenting so refuse to get you the medical help you need, whether it is ADHD or something else."
"Just wait dude, when you are 18 you can do whatever you want, if you do it know you will get nothing"
"You will fight with your parents, they will get mad at you, probably make the situation about themselves, ignore your diagnosis, grow resentment"
You will get nothing positive out of that
"Do you know your parents are refusing to get you a diagnosis? 
It might be about how they feel about you or their own parenting (cause some parents can take is personally for whatever reason i don't get)"
"
But some parents maybe don't believe ADHD is real and think ADHD is a hoax by pharmaceutical companies"
E.g
people who follow RFK Jr
can be this way.
"Hey, what symptoms have you been experiencing?"
I don’t think it’s a matter of pride as much as that I’m being dramatic bc I can hide the symptoms well
They aren’t but parents always feel they know YOU better than you do
I don’t hate my parents for this and we are still very close but this is exactly my worry once I go to college soon
I don’t want to suffer from even more failure from something that can be helped relatively easily
That’s what I seem to keep hearing so I guess once I turn 18 I’ll just go get a diagnosis
My parents aren’t neglectful but they tend to think people are dramatic when it comes to mental issues like adhd
"Unfortunately I live in a very small town so there is really no one who could talk to my parents, I’ll prolly just have to wait till college"
That’s my current plan
My parents do believe it’s real but since I didn’t have it as a kid they basically just tell me to focus or lock in which is not very productive
Mostly derealization and just a general disconnect from reality paired with the standard object permanence and lack of motivation
These are the core ones but there are more too.
"That’s not being dramatic, that’s called a coping mechanism"
"I don’t know enough to say whether it’s healthy or not, but if we’re spitballing I’m gonna lean more towards the belief that you shouldn’t have to hide symptoms of a medical condition to appease people that aren’t you, irrespective of whether you fell out of one of those people’s vagina."
"Sure, but the point is that they think they know if you do or do not have a condition and that requires an entirely different knowledge base that they very likely don't have other than ""ADHD is can't-sit-still-disease"""
You’re responsible for you and you should never feel obligated to not do what’s right for you because of others feelings
"

Also think of it this way"
"If you broke your arm and your parents said it’d be fine without treatment, you’d still go to a hospital, right? It’s your health"
"

Your mental health is the same"
It’s health
You take care of your health.
That is being neglectful though.
Good luck then brother
"I was diagnosed at almost 17, is kinda shitty to live without being sure of it, but in a couple years you will make huge improvements with treatment, don’t rush, you have time"
If you need help with anything there is lot of people who will give you advice meanwhile
"Could you be depressed these are all symptoms of depression too? I have ADHD and got diagnosed as an adult, which is much harder to do"
"I can not pay attention to save my life.if I am reading a book I will reread the dame paragraph 5 or 6 times before I am.able to get past it, each time remembering that I already read this, look for my spot again and reread it again"
"Although if it comes in at a higher rate of speed, I find it easier to pay attention"
 I can listen to audio books at 3 times their speed
"Or I can listen to a book, watch a movie, and play a video game at the same time"
"If it's only one thing, it's much harder to do."
"I mean more control rather than hide, but either way as a minor I fear there is little I can do about getting a diagnosis or medication"
"Pretty on the nose, not sure what I can do with this though bc I’m still a minor"
I guess sorta but it’s coming from a place of love not malice
"Thank you, hopefully I can get something soonish"
I don’t think I’m depressed but I can go into depressive episodes due to my adhd I think
Like when my grades suffer or whatever else
I also listen to audio books bc it’s the only way I can read now
"That much is true, which sucks"
The upshot is that soon you will have a lot more control over your life and the opportunity to get diagnosed
Just keep in mind that a diagnosis isn’t a panacea
It’s just someone that went to med school giving an educated opinion and you’re still responsible your actions
"My advice is to control what you can, which is how you adapt to your symptoms and how you interact with the world around you"
"You have a long way to go in dealing with this in a healthy way, no reason not to get started on that now."
Are there laws in your country that say a minor can't see a therapist on their own?
"You could ask to talk to a psychiatrist about depression, then talk to the psychiatrist about getting diagnosed with ADHD"
You should be able to be in the room with the psychiatrist with oit your parents
It's not exactly a lie if the ADHD is causing depression
 It's also much harder to get diagnosed as an adult.
No I live in the US but it’s more so the money that I don’t have to pay for one
I would but unfortunately I live in a very small town and there are no psychiatrists here so my only real option is to go to a doctor I think
"Well, minors can get jobs and if this is that important to you, then there are ways to achieve what you are looking for"
" 
Do you have a family doctor? If so, you can ask them questions."
A lot of doctors do not like prescribing ADHD medicine as the stimulates are controlled substances
" Also, the only ones that work on me."
I can but I feel it would drive a wedge between myself and my parents
I do have a job at the moment but I don’t have enough disposable income to spend it on a therapist or psychiatrist or anything
"It's Diffently worth trying, though."
"What's more important to you? A relationship with people who refuse to take your mental health and potentially the rest of your life, seriously? Or making sure you can have a real life by getting on top of things sooner?

Any parent who would take slight at their child looking out for their own mental health is a bad parent"
Full stop
"I doubt they would hold it against you if you did it for yourself.

If you have any disposable income, then you have the ability to save it"
" 
If you want an ADHD assessment, then you're going to have to sacrifice a bit of fun for a while and save up some cash or get a better paying job, or work more hours"
" 
It's a simple choice, my man"
"You either want it, or you don't"
"

If you decide yes, then you know what you gotta do."
Asking your doctor questions isn't going to drive a wedge between you and your parents that isn't already there
" 
Ask your doctor what kinds of services are subsidized and how you can go about getting tested on a low income"
Find out if it's covered under the health insurance plan your parents have you on
"  
The point is, ASK QUESTIONS"
That's what your doctor is there for
To keep you healthy.
I agree

Going to the effort to ask the community exactly this would make me so happy if I was your guy
Most would absolutely not go to the effort
Generally people expect ADHDers to adapt to societal norms
Your generosity will be greatly appreciated! He's a lucky guy.
"Vocally supporting from the sidelines, we don’t have the ability to turn completed tasks into a feeling of satisfaction"
"Saying you’re so proud of him and so on when he does even the littlest of things.

Stability, always provide stability"
"Be understanding and patient, when he loses his keys or phone for the 100th time that day, or when he’s taking a little longer to get to something- casual reminders that don’t make him feel stupid.

Ask about his interests, take part in them, research those things on your own, get him little knickknacks that he can keep around him during the day.

Be sensitive on rejections, some of us take them a little harder than others.

Never, ever, say he’s being too loud/too much/too crazy when he unmasks around you unless you never want him to he his genuine self again."
![gif](giphy|zHd8x7Pik0Ftm)
Small things like “Would you like me to make you some tea?” are the best for me
And knowing that my partner has learned to separate me and my ADHD
I can tell by how he interacts with me.
"The most important question, is he self aware? As in aware of himself, his emotions, and takes a good care of himself? 

Bcs if no matter how good you take care of them, love them, if the person is not aware themselves, nothing can change them / make them feel loved"
 When someone listens and asks questions to understand me or my situation better is what makes me feel most seen and cared for.
Don’t be hurt if he’s hyper focused on something it seems irritable when you pull him away from it
"It can be hard for some of us stopping and starting tasks, and when it comes to stuff we hyper focus on, some of us can get irritable but it isn’t an attack on you at all"
Coming with tea/drink or a snack helps me from getting irritated
Listen
"Most people find me explaining general relativity in painfully small detail very uninteresting, but if someone were to be interested in what i say and listen and engage and ask well-thought questions.."
I'd go buy a wedding ring.
"He’ll have all sorts of coping mechanisms he’s developed over the years, sometimes without even realising.

So, don’t call him out on these things he does as being weird or strange, just accept it as part of him and let him know that these things are ok with you"
"

Don’t be afraid to tell him every day that you love him and remind him of all the good things you see in him"
"

Listen to him, if he thinks something is unfair or an injustice, listen to his why, help him work through it"
"

Don’t nag him if stuff isn’t finished or done how you’d expect it to be, instead be supportive and find ways to encourage him"
"

If he’s overwhelmed and unable to get things started, offer to be in the same room as him or sit next to him, so he can use you as a body double and get back on track"
"

Ultimately, hats off to you for caring enough to want to understand this stuff - it sounds like you’ll make a great partner for him!"
You will get as many answers as there are people
"You will get some pointers, but seeding as how my brain is such a labyrint to navigator to even make myself do this and that, i suggest communicating with him"
Yoy have a great attitude and he will most likely appreciate it.
"Do something that you're good at, do it really well, get so good that you help people learn to do it, receive a ""you're good at this"" pat on the head, rinse and repeat.

Honestly speaking though, it's hard because you feel like compliments or praise is all underwhelming in comparison to how hard you had to work to do whatever you do, and in all reality you do have to work a bit harder than most, but try to remember this"
"We are loved, we just suck as picking up social cues so the appreciation or love we receive often does slip through our fingers.

You're loved, your efforts are acknowledged even if not verbally, and you're cared for"
"Remember, love, and acknowledgement is always based on how much people have in front of them and you won't always be noticed because sometimes people have their view obstructed by their own personal baggage"
"Love yourself, until the love pours from you and fills the glasses of everyone around you."
My non adhd best friend reading and watching yt videos on adhd and trying to offer me tips from there haha
It was sooo sweet! In a world full of people who don’t understand ADHD this woman was going miles to understand it and help me out
"She is truly the BEST FRIEND!


Edit: I just read your entire post lmao"
"This is so sweet what u are doing rn :) This is step one honestly, understanding.

We tend to be critical of ourselves, maybe telling us it’s okay? Basically you know being kinder to us and a super gentle reminded that we are trying our best goes a long way.


Acts of service are god sent"
It’s hard for us to get ourselves to do the most “easy” tasks
"For a non ADHD person it’s probably nothing, but means the world to us and can make a huge difference.


Mostly just being there for us"
That is all we really need
True understanding
Which you are trying to do so it’s extremely wonderful
He is lucky to have you :)
"1) he watches movies/reels and reads articles 
2) he holds me/ reminds me to breathe when i have a meltdown 
3) he reassures me of his love (and if hes not angry that he is not angry) when i mess up
4) he bought a lable maker i requested so i knew where my cups and bowls were without opening a cupboard and labelled it with me
5) he doesn’t call me a slob, but can still express overwhelm when things are in piles, and cleans with me
6) he swept my floor with out asking and moved my recycling to a more logical place (with permission)"
noticing things that i do and vocalising them
"it makes me go “wait, you actually perceive me and consider me? you have thoughts about me that are positive?? what??!”
i’d say receiving gifts is also really intimate because someone sees you enough to consider you"
acknowledging your interest and song choices etc
"
also not being judgemental of their behaviour, especially if it changes w every hangout, every small thing affects our mood so it might vary (at least imo)"
"it comes with its highs and lows, but with how caring of a person you seem to be u don’t have much to worry about"
"you’re amazing and i am sure what you’re doing is very much appreciated <3
these are just little things :)"
"Everyone's different, but as an ADHD lady with a non-ADHD partner, I LOVE that he listens"
Even when I've been spouting nonsense for the last half-hour about this week's obsession
"

It's like he lets me download all the noise out of my brain, and actually seems to be interested."
Vocal support and listening!! A lot of the times we ramble about our niche interests but often times we keep them to ourselves because of fear no one really cares
When someone actually engages about my interest I get so excited! So sweet of you to ask :)
- Actions of service
Making something for them
Something small
"Tea? 

-Listening to them and giving feedback"
Like actually try to listen and ask questions
"(This is pretty basic for all people, just make sure that it’s not one sided.)

- I love hugs from the people I like, otherwise I hate touching people"
If he also likes hugs then accept them openly and show enthusiasm! 
I don’t like to be hugged as much as I like to hug but I think that’s just me lol
"

- if someone helped me with my schedule (not like a baby but being slightly helpful, asking about if I’ve done something I mentioned i wanted to do) then I would probably melt."
Just love him in spite of this disability and show it
"Long term, try to look at the symptoms as symptoms rather than malice (will be hard to keep in mind!)"
This post and this comment section are beautiful
"I know I'm not providing an answer to the post, but I read some comments and just wanted to cry"
I'm very happy that some of you guys found someone who cares and loves you
"Sincerely, I'm proud and wish you all the best in life! I just can't continue reading the comments, or else I'm going to break down in tears.

OP, you're a fantastic human being"
I flip flop on how I feel about myself
"On good days, I chuckle at my ADHD symptoms and go easy on myself"
"On hard days, I feel unlovable and unworthy.

On those hard days, my partner saying, ""I love you the way you are,"" really does so much for me."
"showing interest in his interests or sharing them is definitely one of the best for me, also maybe acts of service or helping in something he may struggle with cus of the adhd?"
Both me and my partner are adhd
I try to support his executive dysfunction
"If he says he's going to do something (like take out the trash) but can't, getting upset or frustrated only makes him feel shitty and adds a layer of anxiety to our relationship"
"Chores are flexible, and they have a period of time within when they need to be done"
I try to reassure him and offer patience
"He's voiced that this has been pretty huge to him, and I've noticed that he's become more secure and kinder to himself.

For me, he validates my feelings"
"He is always receptive, and he doesn't get defensive"
"When I'm struggling with grief, he stops and soothes me"
He is accountable
"I have some pretty significant trauma from a previous marriage, and he tries to be cognizant of that.

We both really like tangible acts of love"
"He will pick up special treats for me when he runs errands (I have food allergies, so usually specialty items)"
He brings me coffee in bed when my alarm goes off every morning
That is my most favorite by far
"When I'm on evening shift, I try to leave him love notes and make dinner for him because his job is physically taxing"
"Signs that we are thinking of each other throughout our day, you know? Small things that make you feel seen."
"One pat on the back

Twice a week, out of the blue

His heart belongs to you"
RemindMe! 2 days
Unless they are using ADHD as a crutch for everything
Reassurance  goes a long way. 
Exactly what I was going to post....
I need to forward this comment to my bf 👀 sadly he kind of lost patience when it comes to me leaving the hob on and increasing  the risk of fire in the flat !
"I actually just broke up with my girlfriend because I asked her to do these things, and she did the opposite in fear of losing the relationship"
"It drove me further, and I further understood why it wasn't going to work.

Best of luck, everyone's story is different."
Hahahaha my life when someone actually notices my struggles and asks me about them
"Yes!!!! small things are often the worst ones, stuff that could be done easily but that can pile up and don't feel like the effort of getting up to do."
This is a very important comment
There’s the one side of being kind and understanding and curious and open towards your partner
"There’s another very important side of your partner being all those things to themselves, which btw can be extremely difficult"
"

Sometimes all the love in the world won’t do much if they don’t love themselves"
As in remember that’s it’s not like you’re responsible for their happiness etc
"You’re in a relationship together on a journey and ADHD is part of your journey, it changes some of the scenery, means you might have to take different paths etc"
But it’s not like you’re responsible for building all the scenery and choosing the roads yourself :)
"Safety is everyone's responsibility! Tempering that impulsive response is hard though, but not impossible."
"Yep, same"
"I feel so invisible all the time, when someone offers me breadcrumbs of empathy and understanding, I break down crying."
"It did get better in my case, I used to leave the hob on daily, now it’s only once every couple
Months or so"
It was just a case of never leaving the kitchen when I’m cooking
*Never ever*

Or it could be ADHD caused by brain injury
"Experts are still debating whether that should be classified as ""ADHD"", or as a separate condition - but either way, the same treatments will often work, so in practice, the distinction may not be super important after all"
"Just get yourself assessed, make sure you mention your brain trauma, and see what comes out - the important part is not the label you put on it, it's that you get help."
I had similar doubts when I started looking into my issues
"Turns out, head injuries can definitely complicate things, and sometimes symptoms overlap"
"A thorough assessment should help clarify things, though—maybe keep a diary of your symptoms and share your history with them? The right professional will understand the nuances and offer the help you need"
Good luck!
"Head trauma can actually cause ADHD! 

ADHD is characterised by certain structural differences/deficits inside the brain - in alot of cases, these structural differences are acquired genetically, but head trauma is one of the causes too ☺️"
TBI should be ruled out prior to assessing for ADHD
I can relate
"Growing up with multiple bad concussions (one as an infant and one around 5 yo), brain damage was a very real part of my self-image"
"Difficulty concentrating, forgetting lunchboxes at school, feeling left behind in conversation: all things that I just semi-jokingly attributed to my concussions"
"But I did fine in school, and I had many hobbies and extracurriculars so I never was pushed to seek evaluation"
"


I didn't even know what ADHD was until my college roommate gave me his medication (don't do this kids) and I didn't really get evaluated/prescribed for another 10 wasted years"
"But now looking back, it's pretty obvious to me that my ADHD symptoms were distorted due to my own self-image, and while I'm sure these symptoms could have been caused/worsened by my concussions, I see now that ADHD is rampant in my family so the chances of a genetic connection seem just as likely.


Obviously this is all anecdotal, but adhd treatment is definitely working for me, so take that as you will and hope everything works out for you!"
"i could imagine it going a similar route to diabetes.
with an acquired type and a from childhood type.

so long as those who need treatments can get it its fine with me"
"Traumatic brain injury can have such a vast impact.
lots of symptoms in common with ADHD depending on affected areas"
"not sure if its officially recognised yet though.

Also..."
"highly recommend, if you already have ADHD dont get a TBI to go with it"
had a parent loose so much QOL to it :/
"Exactly.

In the end, ADHD is currently defined in terms of symptoms, so until we get a better picture of the causes, it's mostly a potato/potahto discussion."

"If I did everything perfectly, they wouldn’t see the areas I struggle and be able to diagnose me"

"As I said, most weekends, I take a meds break, and I would say that most Saturdays are a recharge day, with Sunday being more productive."
On vacation now and decided I'd stop taking Adderall for a bit to see how I feel and if there's any difference
"Doesn't seem like much to me, but something ""weird"" has been feeling hungry again! Really reminds me how little I have been eating"
So at the very least I'm greatful to have natural reminders to eat again

i haven’t done an essay for a class and it’s been a month and a half

Please! Paragraphs! I am begging you
"Yeah, this is a big problem for me too"
"Whenever I try to watch Gordon Ramsey shows with my sister in the evening, I can barely stay focused enough to fully understand what is going on in the episode"
I honestly can't tell you what happened in the episode even if I tried
"Even whenever I try to binge watch the Masked Singer I mind blanks out to where I can't remember what some performances were, which sucks because it does feel like I skipped some episodes"
"Granted, this has gotten better with my medication, but in the evening, where my medication wears off, the problem is pretty consitent"
"It is called ""interest-based rewards system"" by developmental process."
Oh this happens all the time
I watch something and lose focus and go on my phone and miss everything that’s happened
This happens me to me that’s why I barely watch tv unless I really want to watch
"I honestly have a hard time focusing if I'm not doing something else at the same time.

I've picked up cross stitching lately so I've been doing that while watching shows"
"However, they were all shows I already watched (Hazbin Hotel, most of Teen Wolf), knew the plot of (Fruit Basket), or knew enough about since I already watched later episodes (One Piece, MHA, JJK)

I don't think I could follow 100% if it was a brand new show"
I've been watching youtube videos on weird shit the past week or so lmao
Binge watching shows 
"As someone with ""just"" mild ADHD I had the same issue growing up"
"

As another comment stated - ADHD creates a reward seeking brain, and watching shows/movies are a very much reward based activity"
The focus can really turn either way though
"If you find yourself bored by the details in the show, it's simply not going to spark any interest in you, and will keep you unfocused"
"

I would like to say that it has a lot to do with age and maturity as well"
I had to grow up in order to understand the nuances and deeper meanings of the shows/stories
I wasn't really interested in films/shows/long videos until I was about 22 (still not diagnosed or medicated)
The new found understanding made me much more inclined to follow along and care deeper about the plot
"

I'm guessing you are largely functioning the same when it comes to school and how you relate to each subject;
Some subjects will be fun, interesting and rewarding, and others will be hard to understand, boring and super unrewarding"
"This pickiness is unfortunately what ADHD brings us, and we need to put our energy into what brings us joy and engagement in order to keep our focus, interests and joy in life intact"
"


With that, my advice to you is to not be too worried about your bad focus"
"Watch what makes you engaged, and have fun maturing and learning"
"
We have all rewatched shows/films from our childhood/teens as adults, and realized so much more than we did when we were much younger :) 




TLDR: Knowledge helps you enjoy things"
"Maturity and understanding leads to better focus in just about anything, including series/movies."
This is normal
"Not only about shows, it's normal for every type of activity if you have adhd."
Yeah I definitely can't binge TV shows most of the time
Maybe if it's something I already watched so it doesn't matter if I'm barely paying attention
It's legit a chore to sit down and watch even 20 minutes of a show I genuinely like
Brain has to work hard even in your leisure time :(
I lose focus when Im on a webinar 😮‍💨
I was listening but my mind wandered around
"So when group discussions happen, I could not share anything."
Sometime putting on subtitles help or watching with someone else or while doing something
If the show gets more interesting then I’ll probably just focus solely on it instead.
"I can watch hours and hours of a show if I'm using it as a distraction from stuff I actually should be doing, so you might want to re-watch BB and BCS by the time you need to file your taxes"
";)

On a more serious note, in general things that help me focus are: really liking the show, being physically tired (so after a work out or a long walk), having something to fidget with, changing the language to one I don't speak and turning the subtitles on"
"With the last one I still zone out, but catch myself sooner"
"

Also, there are some shows that are very much critically acclaimed but just aren't for me and I can't get through (funnily enough Breaking Bad is one of them)."
I can’t watch standup comedy
I zone out like a MF-er.
Lol! I only watch TV shows when I need to wait for an online match in video games
I used to be like this
Now I divide my day in 3
"Morning coffee with friends until 14, YouTube or gaming until 20:00, then reddit or news, etc before bed"
"I often switch the last two around, but by delaying things i want to do like this, i don't get bored to detth by them earlier in the day.

If I go directly for reddit in the morning, i miss out on the social bit, i dont get outside and I feel guilty and bad the rest of the day and I'm sick of reddit by noon.

Watching TV i can do in the afternoon when i've exhausted some of my adhd-energy"
I can not do it earlier in the day
Not even if i tried.
"
I’ve always struggled with this too, medication does help a bit"
"I can focus on dialogue for longer and remain seated for the duration.

I watch tv shows while simultaneously being on my phone"
Short episodes help
"Subtitles also help (but my wife hates them so only use when alone).

If I’m watching something new that requires focus it has to be very interesting, and I have to watch it in the morning on a weekend.

If shows don’t interest me, I will tune them out and probably couldn’t recount anything about them at all."
I end up watching everything in bits and pieces.
I can't just watch a TV show or movie
I become distracted
I have to play a video game whole watching.
I can’t watch stupid shows
My brain cannot handle it
"

I need thrillers or documentaries, real crime is what keeps my mind occupied"
Sorryyy😭😭😭
"I looked into it and I gotta say, this makes so much sense"
This fits with my day to day life lowkey.
"Sorry, but your wife not allowing you to keep subtitles on is .."
not very considerate
I can't imagine why she would mind it so much ...? Seems like a small concession to make for your significant other.
Please be civil and do not diminish someone's interests
These shows are interesting for millions of people
There's no need to be rude here.
"It’s not a big deal! I think I got a bit overwhelmed when I saw the huge block of text with no spacing, especially since I was so eager to read the post."
What? I meant it to confirm what the TO says
"
I also cannot watch those mundane shows"
