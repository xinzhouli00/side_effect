Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôm so glad it worked for you! I‚Äôve been on it for years! I love it! It also helped me to quit smoking because that‚Äôs another thing it‚Äôs used for.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Congrats man. That shit just made me so goddamn horny
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I'm 50, diagnosed with ADHD at 42 or so. Been on Vyvanse 30-40mg until 3 months ago. At my last physical, my GP (who has been working with me on my meds) told me that my current blood pressure and minor issue with my heart were a direct result of Vyvanse and keeping with Vyvanse was going to kill me. Put me on 300 mg of Wellbutrin. 

It took about three weeks before I felt the full benefit, but holy shitballs, it's fantastic. I've described my ADHD as being in a huge gymnasium with thousands of post-it notes being blown around by huge fans, each note being a different thought - an answer to a question, a task to do, something I forgot to do yesterday, what I need to do tomorrow, a new book idea, etc etc etc. Vyvanse shrank the size of room and decreased the number of post-its, making it easier to find the right thought to focus on and maintain a thread of thought. 

Wellbutrin is completely different. First and foremost, I didn't realize how many of my thoughts were negative (negative self.talk, guilt over what is forgotten, etc). They're all gone and what's left is a much smaller number of positive and productive thoughts. My much more positive brain is also far quieter. 

The only side effect thus far is it seems to have increased my appetite and I've put on about six pounds over the past two months. Now that I've become aware of it, I can fix it. That being the only negative aspect of Wellbutrin is something I can live with. My relationship with my wife has improved tons since then and I'm genuinely happy, fully and wholly happy 95% of my days for the first time in decades. 

Recent research has shown that a HUGE negative component of ADHD is emotional. Wellbutrin addresses that really well and I hope more folks can enjoy the benefit of it, just as I have."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I use this as well! I‚Äôve been trying to pass for a tech certification for nearly 7 years. Got diagnosed with ADHD, started in Wellbutrin, and lo and behold, certified in months after a refresher. Had friends telling me I seemed more focused too. I‚Äôve had great success with Wellbutrin"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Comments here are everything from wellbutrin saved my life to wellbutrin made me suicidal. Just goes to show everyone's brains are different and it's so fucking important to have a provider who cares and most importantly actually LISTENS to you üôè
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I got put on wellbutrin first due to history of anxiety and depression. It worked very very well for about 3 weeks, then it made my anxiety go crazy and brought back the depression I'd been over for 3 years. I was actually suicidal, shit sucked. Ritalin is working well for me now. I got on Zoloft for my anxiety, but that made it so much worse to the point I couldn't sleep without a light on, seriously, my anxiety got so bad I became scared of the dark.

Hope this keeps working well for you!"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,[deleted]
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"That one was not a winner for me, it took away my anxiety but then I was just neutral non functioning instead of chaotic non functioning. It was odd. 

I‚Äôm so glad it works for you though!! It‚Äôs such a relief to find the right thing. I recently got my glasses too and the analogy really applies. Calm focused attention is such a great thing to have."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Wellbutrin for me helped in some ways but it gave me this weird side effect where I had this horrible inability to find words I was trying to say. Like I could never think of words in the middle of my sentence. Worse than my normal adhd version of that. Felt like I was having a stroke
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I had multiple breakdowns and suicidal thoughts on Wellbutrin. Glad it worked for you. That shit isn‚Äôt for me.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Wellbutrin gave me terrible insomnia. I really wanted it to work, too"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"üëèüëèCongratulations !

I can‚Äôt wait to have a similar success story üòÑ"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I couldn't agree more. Other than 1 day of intense suicidal ideation when I titrated up, my depression is managed, adhd symptoms are lessened, my sex drive is back in full gear, and I quit smoking."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Wellbutrin is my drug of choice! 
Been on it for years, was put in it for depression bc I refused SSRIs due to their side effects. 
Bc of their SE, I would quit taking it as soon as I ‚Äúfelt better‚Äù which meant I never had any real remissions from my depression (diagnosed at 13.)

Anyway, after the Wellbutrin got my depression under control, I was telling my psychiatrist about remaining issues lack of motivation/ difficulty with task initiation, losing things etc. he said he suspected I was ADHD before the Wellbutrin and diagnosed me. He added a small dose of adderall and I have never been so well!

It‚Äôs really frustrating that I spent most of my life struggling and all anyone did was throw SSRIs at me.  I am really grateful to have found Wellbutrin!"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"It was prescribed to me to manage depression and support ADHD. I'm some ways it did, but in others it has made me worse, recently given Lexapro to try and manage undeying anxiety's.

I don't think I can be prescribed concerta as an adult here, it worked as a child toyoung adult, then I went off the rails a bit and never went back on.

Moved countries since and doctor has said it is very hard to prescribe to adults here, even though it is fee paying health care.


I type this as i sit late outside doctors office because today I decided to not set all my reminder alarms and  let my brain choose the appropriate leaving time, which did not include 30 minutes lost on the wrong expressway.

So now I'm more agitated than normal, brain is pinging away like made and I've got to tell this guy how my last month has been

Absolutely fucking chaotic thanks."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I kinda teared up since I'm probably starting wellbutrin soon and i have been in a really dark place lately... Thank you for giving me hope!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Made me suicidal.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Doesnt wellbutrin have the side effect of making you extremely furious all the time? I think i used it and was so angry at everything that i turned into kyle and punched through my door
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Wellbutrin sucked a** for me.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Glad you find what works for you! I‚Äôm 36. I wasn‚Äôt diagnosed with ADHD until a few months ago. For the last 18 years they‚Äôve been trying to treat my depression, anxiety and occasional OCD with a hint of mild addictions (like unnecessary shopping, food addiction or minor gambling). I was on and off with all kinds of antidepressants but none of them really helped except Wellbutrin. It was about 6 years ago and at some point I quit using it but I can‚Äôt remember why. Probably a side effect that I couldn‚Äôt handle. Before ADHD diagnosis, the second antidepressant that worked for me was trintellix (Vortioxetine) which I‚Äôm still on with Ritalin. Maybe I should ask my doc to switch trintellix with Wellbutrin. I feel like Ritalin and Wellbutrin can be a good combo. Or maybe not, who knows‚Ä¶"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,[deleted]
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,You had that moment too? Did it also go away after like 10 minutes of rushed productivity?
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Did Wellbutrin for two weeks but it made my chest hurt (and I have a minor heart condition so Wellbutrin was supposed to be instead of a stimulant) so now I‚Äôm transitioning from Zoloft (which I‚Äôve been on for years) to Effexor. So far I can notice a difference on my Effexor days.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I take Wellbutrin with a mood stabilizer to treat bipolar disorder.  Works great for depression and ADHD symptoms that were exasperated by depression (motivation initiating and completing tasks, emotion regulation, etc) but does nothing for focus, memory, sensory overload and fidgeting.  Also took a long ass time to see any consistent significant improvement.  1st week I felt great, then awful anxiety and insomnia for weeks, then great again after dose increase and then like shit again 2 weeks later.  Lots of ups and downs with anxiety.  I‚Äôve been on 150mg for 4 months and only started to really feel any benefit recently after adding buspar to the mix.  It‚Äôs great to hear so many success stories.  I wish it worked as well for my ADHD comorbidity."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I was prescribed Wellbutrin while waiting for my official assessment and it definitely helped for a bit. The effect waned, but I‚Äôm sure it was still helpful a bit. But then I realized I was really irritable, but it took months to develop and happened slowly so I didn‚Äôt realize. Eventually I was routinely shouting at my toddlers for very normal toddler shit that, logically, didn‚Äôt bother me that much. But when under the slightest amount of pressure or rushing, I‚Äôd blow my top over basically nothing. 

I was able to start adderall so I stopped the Wellbutrin because a shouty dick head is not the kind of parent I want to be, but man do I wish I had quit smoking entirely while on the Wellbutrin. I cut down so much purely by accident and now that I‚Äôm on adderall I just want to smoke like a damn chimney.

Edit: this ended up being all about me but the point was keep an eye over time. I hadn‚Äôt realized side effects could creep in slowly over months like that."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"This is what happened to me too, it‚Äôs a life changer for me. Unfortunately in Australia it‚Äôs mainly prescribed for smoking cessation and it‚Äôs quite expensive off label. I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs working for you."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I'm glad it helps! I was on Wellbutrin at one point when I still thought my primary diagnosis was depression and it makes sense now why it was the only medication that helped. I then impulsively went off meds while having no GP and wasted three years of my life lul
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I‚Äôm so happy you found what works for you! And that you have a doctor who listens.

I‚Äôm on Adderall and once my body got over the initial ‚ÄúAhhh stimulants!!!!‚Äù reaction, and I was calm and focused, all I could think was, is this how neurotypical people go through life? No wonder people thought I was lazy and didn‚Äôt apply myself. If my brain had always worked like *this*, I‚Äôd have been so much more productive, wouldn‚Äôt forget things as often, could hold a conversation without getting bored.  I‚Äôm still mostly time-blind, but everything else has improved so much with the right meds (and thank goodness, because antidepressants eff me up bad).  I‚Äôm just really happy and excited for you."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I wish Wellbutrin had worked for me. No negative effects really, but not much improvement"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"ME TOO! Started taking it and my brain just calmed down for once. Oh look I need to do dishes, bam dishes are done."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,[deleted]
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,What dosage r u on? I take wellbutrin sr 150mg atm now and nothing has changed at all it has no effect whatsoever
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I'm glad it does that for you. In my case, it doesn't do a thing about the constant mental noise, but it can help a bit with just... Any motivation to leave bed, and to stay awake. Mind you I only just found out I have ADHD and am hoping to get diagnosed and switch meds soon."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Dude this was the medication that made me a functioning human. So glad I found it- and glad for you too!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Wellbutrin saved my ass from comorbid ADHD and depression. Every medication has different effect on different people and you are being subjective. I also take Vyvanse.

Edit. Sorry for being judgemental. I just read the whole text  Yes it's a good med, but be careful and don't judge too soon. Let the med reach its stable plasma concentration."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I got pretty bad rash on my hands from it. I was also really hoping it'd work since it's also supposed to help you stop smoking.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Im glad to hear this rn my psych has me on a small dosage to get it in my system hoping to see better results next month.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Oooo! That's neat to know! If these addys don't really do justice for me I'll ask for the wellbutrin option that was given to me! Thank you!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Just got diagnosed at 35 and this is exactly my experience but for Adderall. Weird what molecules work for each of us. I was glad the first one worked. Congrats!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I liked Wellbutrin, for depression, but it didn‚Äôt do much for my ADHD. My husband takes it for ADHD and anxiety and it‚Äôs doing well by him. Glad you found something that helps!"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Wellbutrin was the best thing I ever took. Ate healthier, exercised, quit vaping, did well in school. Then they discontinued the generic I was taking and everything fell apart again. I called every pharmacy and tried every other generic but none of them lived up to the original. I'm back on Concerta and doing well but I guess I just have to fight depression the old fashioned way now. Glad it's working for you!"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"That‚Äôs awesome, hope it continues to be a successful one for you to take. I‚Äôve been on it for about. 10 years  now, it is just started losing its effectiveness within the last year, time for a med review."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Im glad it works for you. I was convinced my doctor gave me sugar pills when I took wellbutrin, didn't do a thing."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"It turns your mind on a like a firecracker that‚Äôs never gotten lit before.
It makes you feel like your engine finally has gas.
My doctors really like yours. I approached him desperate about not even having the energy to get up in the morning and no attention to make food.
Now I sleep only 8 hours a day.

Wake up feeling way better.

Have enough mental energy to actually have a romantic life (which just flat out never happened because I was so inattentive I didn‚Äôt even have that desire).

It still works. It has not lost its effectiveness. It‚Äôs so much fucking better than adderall it‚Äôs insane"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Zoloft for adhd?
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Wellbutrin kinda worked for me at first. For some reason after a while it made my mental health kinda plummet. The worst part was that it made my insomnia worse, I didn‚Äôt get a full 8 hours for like a month or two"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Wellbutrin made me numb I guess. But it gave me HORRIBLE insomnia and I have no idea why.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Now that I think about it when I started wellbutrin I seemed to be able to focus better XD I went on it for depression so it's doing double time for me but yea it is an amazing drug XD congratulations on finding something that works!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Ugh, I wish it had worked for me! It totally helped me quit smoking, and initially it did calm me, but eventually I went off and when I tried to return to it it did nothing."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I couldn't tell any difference on wellbutrin, even once worked up to high dosages. It was weird. Adderall fairly well at least, although Vyvanse would be nice to give a chance if I could actually afford it.

Glad the medication has helped you and so many others in this comment section though!"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,ive never been tested or diagnosed with ADHD but it's something I identify with heavily and sort of self-diagnosed. but I also recently started Wellbutrin to help me with my depression and I've had a similar experience. really helped me with my struggle to do things. literally had no motivation to do anything before but now it's just second nature
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Wellbutrin was working so well for me, it was for depression but I had suspicions I had adhd as well. At around day 22 I started getting a horrible rash and I stuck it out to see if it went away but it never did and had to stop. Now I‚Äôm on Prozac and it does nothing for me, which I‚Äôve read that antidepressants don‚Äôt always work for people with adhd. I wish I could try Wellbutrin again."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Hahaha tried that.  Almost ruined my life.  I'm a Lexapro fan. Happy for you!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I'm happy for you! 

It didn't work for me and I actually hate it, but that's because they gave it to me when I was going through a bad depressive episode. My official diagnosis is Bipolar II and Wellbutrin, as an antidepressant, made me hypomanic. I was so angry all the time, it's was awful!

Having both bipolar disorder and ADHD means that I have to be careful with meds. But everyone is different, so we react differently to meds. I'm happy to read that so many people had good experiences with it :)"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Cool.  I take 300mg xr and 100 mg to help me get up in the morning.  It was for depression initially.  

When my doc added the 100 mg in the morning i noticed an immediate change and i started waking up at my usual time.

It helped me with the energy but it didn‚Äôt help at all with my ability to *do things* and that‚Äôs where i found out i had ADHD.  

It took us 3 years to find the right combo but when you find it it‚Äôs so great"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"It's my magic pill for me too. Started it to stop smoking but then the online company I was getting it from cut me off because I hadn't stopped yet, I think their limit is six months. I had severely cut down on my smoking, because everything else was working out so well for me. I was focused, happy, lost weight, smoked less, what's not to love? So then I went back to the same company for depression and now have a regular prescription shipped monthly and just have to talk to the NP once every three months, but unfortunately I have to pay about 90 a month for that service. 

One thing of note, when I went to the depression program, they put me on the extended release and it made me a bit manic and snippy. I talked them into putting me back on the standard twice a day one and it works best for me. I like the extended release because it helps you focus more, but it also was just too intense, like I just wanted to keep rolling on getting caught up on everything that I had neglected for years, and that is not good. The standard release one I still get things done and it helps immensely with focus, the only downside is remembering to take it midday. Which I'm off to do (thanks smart watch reminder)."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Welbutrin took me a couple of months to get used to, like 6 months, it was a REALLY tough adjustment.

Stage 1: Red-eyed fury and random constant rage

Stage 2: OMG Street Fighter V feels amaaaaazing bruh

Stage 3: I can't remember faces

Stage 4: \~Ffoggg\~

Stage 5: Wow.  I feel like I suddenly grew a spine and my emotions don't spiral down into the abyss all the time. This is cool.

It wasn't a silver bullet, and you can see why it's not the #1 option to prescribe to people.  But I always scratch my head at the anecdotes I read on here where doctors have some dumb axe to grind against Adderall and so they just do nothing, when options like this exist."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I‚Äôm so happy for you that you‚Äôve found something that works so well, and your dr sounds like an absolute legend, makes such a difference having a dr who cares so much and wants to work with you to find a solution!üòÅ please write in to the drs to say how great he is, I‚Äôm sure he would really love to get a compliment through worküíö"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Glad hear it worked for you! It did precisely nothing for me  lol
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I just got prescribed Wellbutrin this morning and I came to find a good ole honest reddit review.  The relief I have when the first thing I see is: ""Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT""  
I can't even explain it."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Yes! I got it because I'm too anorexic for stimulants but won't take ssris but need medicated. It literally cured my worst symptoms in a week.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Welbutrin has an ugly side for me, makes me turn into the hulk. Constantly angry and hair trigger. Almost punched my infant son at one point. That's what made me realize I needed to get off it."

Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,When did it kick it?
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Really happy wellbutrin worked out for you!  I tried buproprion (generic for wellbutrin) + buspirone and it did nothing for either my ADHD or depression and gave me really, really bad insomnia.  Like, 2 hours of sleep a night bad."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,That‚Äôs fantastic! I‚Äôm happy for you!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Awesome! I got lucky too. Ritalin was the winner, fortunately. Calm and relaxed mind. Sleep like a dog. Lost 30lbs so far. I don‚Äôt need to cope with food anymore. My IQ feels like it‚Äôs cap has been taken off, too."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Congratulations for realsies :D
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Yay congrats!! Always love to hear success stories on here
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Happy to hear you are feeling better!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,It gives me terrible anxiety üò•
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,The only thing wellbutrin did for me was give me insomnia and tinnitus. Glad it's working for you though!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"thanks for this. i started wellbutrin a little over a week ago, and this makes me really hopeful!"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"It's really crazy to me how much better different medicines work for different people. My psychiatrist wanted me to try Wellbutrin before any other ADHD meds, and it made me extremely depressed and anxious. Moving to 20mg Ritalin ER made a world of difference and set me on the right path. I'm glad you found what worked for you!!!"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"So interesting it worked for you! When I tried Wellbutrin it was a scary experience. I couldn‚Äôt sleep and I was extremely suicidal. 

Dexedrine is my brain calmer."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Boy these meds really are person specific. Wellbutrin made me projectile vomit after 3 days.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,[deleted]
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Wellbutrin turned me into a suicidal schizophrenic paranoid zombified robot. The human brain is genuinely fucking *horrifying*. I wouldn‚Äôt give that shit to my worst enemy. But I guess it‚Äôs cool it worked for you tho.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Good for you op. They are my only option because I have no access to methylphenidate, the only stimulant in my country. Can you tell me how many weeks it took for you to see changes?"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Happy to hear it worked for you! I've never heard of Wellbutrin before
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Love that. I'm looking at non stimulant options too because I have hypertension, which unfortunately means stimulants are too risky for me."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I've been on Wellbutrin for months and it helps with my emotional dysregulation but not so much my focus and procrastinating; we just added Strattera a week ago so fingers crossed that this gets me the rest of the way to functionality!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Welbutrin is great for depression too.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I may need to try this
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Wellbutrin was my saving grace lol. I tried adderall, vyvanse, and the come down was awful. I struggled like crazy until my doctor finally switched my to Wellbutrin. Now I can actually function and enjoy life as I do it! I‚Äôm so glad it‚Äôs helping you too üòä"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"My Wellbutrin and Vyvanse combination is the best!! If only I‚Äôd felt this normal and put together before nearly turning 30. So happy it‚Äôs working for you!!! Onward and upward, OP!"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Welbutrin is a crazy drug. I absolutely think it has changed my life and every ADHD person should at least try it, especially if they have depression/anxiety. 

The first few months were kind of whack. I'd be borderline manic at times, other times suicidal, other times very very agressive. Even just at 150mg SR. I think part of that was that it was Sr and not XL, so a lot less smooth and more peaks and valleys.. 

Eventually up to 300mg, again it caused some mood swings at first. But my sleep improved massively. My ability to maintain a schedule and work towards goals improved massively. I still take adderall, but now I can actually do work without it if I really want/need to, or if say it's late at night.

Truly amazing drug and you really need to give it a chance at full dosage. It takes many weeks for the metabolites (which are a big contributor to the drugs function) to fully build up."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"What‚Äôs the dosage you‚Äôre on? Also, happy that It worked for you!!!"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Thank you for sharing. I find that bupropion often gets overlooked in the management of ADHD, it may not always be as effective for some people as a stimulant alone, but it does give steady coverage and has proven efficacy. Many people don't given this medication a chance because they have been programmed to believe it is only an antidepressant, it acts on serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, the second two being what really helps with ADHD. It does take a bit to reach a steady baseline, but then it's there delivering coverage passed the duration that a stimulant would. Is this true for everyone? No, but a much larger majority than one is lead to believe! I'm happy you found your sweet spot"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Zoloft!?! Wtf
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,That's awesome! How long did it take to kick in?
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Thats so good to hear, because Wellbutrin made me insaneüòÇ amphetamines really helped my ADHD:)"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Wellbutrin made me want to slam my head into a wall. Idk what it did to me but I was incredibly irritable.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I was prescribed Wellbutrin for anxiety, and I didn't see any significant benefits until I increased to 200mg SR once a day. I sadly had to drop back down to 150mg because the higher dose made my vision blurry and gave me severe dry eyes. The 150mg works still, just not as well. Going to see if there's an alternative."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I wish I had same experience I just turned into the hulk and wanted to punch everything and hulk out
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,It‚Äôs so interesting how different meds work so differently in people. Wellbutrin makes sense since it does also have some stimulant-effects in it! I‚Äôve heard lots of good things about it. Happy you found something good for you!!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"That's great. I've been on wellbutrin for over a year and it'd helped my depression tremendously. Also on Ritalin. My only complaint is that both are appetite suppressants and I'm losing weight, which I can't really afford to do so gotta figure that out still. But the combination has helped my mental health a lot"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Glad it worked!! I take about 300mg wellbutrin and I love it because it takes all the anxiety away that is usually caused by my adhd but doesn‚Äôt do much anything for my focus so I combine it with adderall ;)
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I'm glad it's working for you!

I tried wellbutrin first while I was still in the process of getting my diagnosis and it barely did anything for me. Ritalin didn't help much either but now I'm on dexedrine and it has been much more successful so far. 
I find that I generally need pretty strong stimulants. Caffeine doesn't do anything at all, and I've even tried some illicit drugs which didn't seem to affect me the way they affect NTs"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,[deleted]
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Wellbutrin has been amazing for me. It quieted all the constant static in my head and my anxiety is damn near gone completely. Im so grateful and glad it‚Äôs working for you too!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,It‚Äôs so great to see someone find what works for them! Happy for you!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Ah man I‚Äôm the exact opposite case as you, Wellbutrin made my stomach feel like there was a living organism trying to tear out of my stomach. Adder all is what ended up changing my life though. I‚Äôm happy you found what works for you though!!"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I‚Äôm on it now, too, and some says I forget to take my second dose of ADHD meds."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I have adhd and idiopathic hypersomnia (extreme fatigue during day) the 2 are linked and I did that too! Adderrall took away anxiety but then made me not care about anything and made me tired. On welbutrin, it's working! Side effects I had are headaches and had to stay close to a bathroom for one month then both went completely away. Oh and 150XL works perfectly for ME. 300 made me angry. So glad to hear you say adderrall made you tired, validates it for me!üíñ"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,[deleted]
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,[deleted]
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Stimulants didn't work for me, either, but Strattera has been amazing! I also take Zoloft and Wellbutrin, but neither of those do much for my ADHD symptoms. Zoloft helps with anxiety and Wellbutrin helps with depression, so between the three of them I can pull off being a semi-functional person most days"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I love Wellbutrin. I have been on it for a year and can honestly say it saved my life. I'm happier and haven't had a suicidal thought in months. I won't ever get off of it if I don't have to.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,[deleted]
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"First, I‚Äôm super happy you found something that works for you. Everyone reacts differently and it‚Äôs just rolling the dice until we find our best treatment. I‚Äôve got a few friends who are similarly over the moon with their Wellbutrin, and that‚Äôs phenomenal to see. 

That said, I was one of the unlucky few who Wellbutrin was just *miserable* for. I swear I pulled almost every side effect, culminating in the ‚Äúweakness‚Äù debuff. I‚Äôd read the list and wondered what that even meant, and then I suddenly had to exert myself to go up the single flight of stairs in my house. The next day just rolling over in bed to grab my water bottle was a Herculean effort. 

After that, I got yanked off it with a quickness and, after a couple weeks of system reset, got put on Adderall, which, for me, was the *‚Äùholy shit‚Äù* difference in functionality I‚Äôd been hoping for. 

If it works it works. If it doesn‚Äôt work, don‚Äôt give up."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I‚Äôd still be on it if not for the blurred vision it gave me! Even an eyeglass prescription couldn‚Äôt fix it. Glad to hear it‚Äôs working so well for you; apart from that particular side effect, I thought it was pretty great."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I‚Äôm on the highest dose of Wellbutrin + 27mg of Concerta and while not perfect, it‚Äôs the best combo I can get. Amphetamines works better for me methylphenidate, but after 10 years on Adderall I had to switch because my resting HR was too high and wouldn‚Äôt come down."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,That's actually what they started me on. It hasn't been having the effect you described quite yet. My mind feels calmer but i still can't seem to do things. Glad you found what works for you though!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Wellbutrin has majorly helped my clinical depression but hasn't even touched my ADHD :(

Good for you though, I'm glad it helped!"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Dang.  I wish I had seen this yesterday morning!  I had a video chat with my doctor because Straterra was making me unable to eat!  I said I wanted to give stimulants a try, so she gave me some Concerta to try while I find a psychiatrist to help me figure out a stimulant.  She was talking about Wellbutrin, but kept saying it was a strong antidepressant but can be used for ADHD.  I guess I should have given it a try!"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Wellbutrin made my hair start falling out. It worked otherwise, and I lost like thirty pounds while on it, but the hair loss made me depressed af so I stopped taking it. It‚Äôs been six months since I stopped taking it completely and my hair is still not recovered."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Damn I'm so glad to hear this worked for you! It's good to know that there are other options for people who don't respond well to stimulant medications.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôm glad Wellbutrin Works for you. I think it should be noted that generally no one has a neutral reaction to Wellbutrin. I‚Äôve had stable friends calling to be say goodbye after two days on Wellbutrin and as soon as they stopped it they stabilized again. Personally Wellbutrin was the closest I‚Äôve came in almost ten years. I also have friends life you that Wellbutrin saved their lives. What I‚Äôm trying to say here is Wellbutrin can be wonderful or horrible and if you get prescribed it and have a major change in your mental state listen to your concerned friends and stop taking Wellbutrin while keeping your psych in the loop.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôm gonna have to try Wellbutrin! I was on sertraline for years but it didn‚Äôt do much to help my ADHD. I tried atomoxetine a couple weeks ago and it made me throw up and my heart race like crazy. I‚Äôm feeling a little defeated because Adderall stopped working for me because I didn‚Äôt want to take it regularly due to decreased appetite and the crash that happens when you‚Äôre first starting out.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Ughhhh I HATE wellbutrin. Felt like I was coming down from shitty coke all day and like I was viewing my life in 3rd person. So jealous that it works for others
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Adderall and Wellbutrin combo here.

Worked fantastic. I am so much more functional."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Wow congrats! What dose are you on?
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,yea i think bupropion is the generic Wellbutrin? combo of that & some methylphenidate seems to do the trick for me
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,[deleted]
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"That's so awesome! You've been on it for a month so you're in the clear probably, but wellbutrin gave me seizures lol. I still get them sometimes too. It's like it trained me to do it argh."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs working for you. I used to think Straterra was a miracle drug. Now I think I need to change things up. Not getting my desired effects.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Congrats. 
It's  your Christmas miracle! (Or whatever type of celebrating you do this time of year)"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,How long did it take for it to start working 100%? I tried taking it a few different times but only for like a week at a time and I didn‚Äôt feel any different except mouth being dry.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,After how many days/weeks did you start feeling it? I just started 3 days ago
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,How long have you been taking it?
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,It regulates my mood.  I wish it motivated and calmed me...  Glad it's working for you.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I'm glad it's working so well! Wellbutrin didn't do much for me other than killing my will to eat.

Fluoxetine? The fucking shit. Jfc man I can handle my emotions now."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,i LOVE wellbutrin. it literally changed my life!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Just curious what dosage is it where you found success? I‚Äôm on Wellbutrin XL 150mg/day and haven‚Äôt noticed anything yet.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Wellbutrin worked for me for three weeks - just minimal improvements, but I was hopeful! Then I broke out in full body hives and they took me off it. Congratulations on your Wellbutrin üò≠üò≠"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Wellbutrin or generic buproprion gave me terrible psychological effects. I heard it helped anxiety and adhd so I was all in but I reacted horribly to it. The voice in my head seemed to disappear and it triggered a severe manic depressive episode. Glad it works for you though!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,ayyyy on wellbutrin too!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"It didn‚Äôt work for me, but hey! I‚Äôm glad it worked for you. Funny enough I find that adderal works wonders whereas that medication could not‚Äîso I guess we‚Äôre just built different lmao"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Glad it worked for you, to me it just gave me the worst panic attack ever, and my ADHD was still chilling like nothing."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,How does it affect your appetite? I keep reading ADHD medications make you loose your appetite.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"This is awesome!!! This is exactly how I felt when I started medication for my ADHD. Finally being able to give my full focus to my homework and class lectures is such a brilliant feeling. I'm so incredibly happy for you, my friend ‚ù§"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Also desvenlafaxine!!! (Pristiq)
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I wish it worked for me. Originally I was going to switch to it from paroxetine but lowering the dose of my SSRI made me feel suicidal so I was stuck on both for a couple months. But wellbutrin gave me really bad tinnitus and these weird light headed ‚Äúdizzy‚Äù spells. Once I stopped it they went away and I don‚Äôt feel any different.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Glad it worked for you! It gave me panic attacks and my hair started to fall out until I quit.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I've only heard negative stuff about Wellbutrin. I wanted on but changed my mind after a friend called it Hell Butrin.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Oh my god I‚Äôm so happy to see this!! I literally just started it yesterday!! Cheers to us!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Really? So good to know! I‚Äôve had my filled Wellbutrin in the cabinet for at least a month and now you‚Äôve given me confidence to start taking them. Thank you. Scared to stop taking meds and the symptoms that come with it which is mainly why I never started it. But that‚Äôs too far away to worry about I guess, I will trust that they will help me now too and will deal with that when the time comes! üôåüèº thanks for sharing. What dose are you on and is it titrated up?"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Anyone been in concerta recently?
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Do you get sick when you drink alcohol on Wellbutrin? I‚Äôm not a huge drinker by any means but the warnings are scary and I‚Äôd like to have a casual drink every so often.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Thank you for posting. I was diagnosed with ADHD yesterday and I've been on lexapro for years just to find out it often worsens ADHD symptoms on young adult women. This info makes is so much more comfortable for me !!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôve noticed on Wellbutrin it makes my mind blank but in a good way I‚Äôm on my 3rd day and have noticed no side effects this feels great
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Wellbutrin is EVERYTHING!!!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,How long did it take to work from when you started taking the medicine?
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,[deleted]
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôm so glad I found this. My Dr prescribed it today for Quiet BPD and anxiety/ADHD. I was afraid to start but think I‚Äôm actually gonna try it.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I am so glad to see these positive posts.  My partner (he is 50), is in good shape but suffers from ptsd which has led to adhd symptoms.  He is so frustrated that he can‚Äôt focus and his business has suffered because of it.  He starts Wellbutrin tomorrow!  I am passing on a few of these posts to him to give him hope and start him off with a positive mindset.  For those that say it increased sex drive‚Ä¶ yikes! I can barely keep up with him now! üòÇ.  I will give an update after he starts."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,[deleted]
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,How long did it take for the Wellbutrin to affect your ADHD? Are you on XL?
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,How is it now that it‚Äôs been a few months? After years of struggling I finally got my first prescription (which is Wellbutrin). Does it affect your creativity?
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I'm happy to read this. I had a doctor appointment yesterday to talk about my anxiety. She thinks I have ADHD so she is setting me up with a psychologist to get a definitive diagnosis and she mailed me Wellbutrin 150mg. I'm really hoping to have some relief.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"yo i thought its a shit like you know it's shitty. my doc want to give me this i hope it will work fine for me coz duloxetine was a fricking disaster. let's go! also tell me... do you have maybe depression  too? because i have adhd and depression, sometimes it even feel like a fucking nightmare major depression... i hope Wellbutrin will work for this too. but idk, maybe i am so depressed because of procrastination in my life which is tbh lvl hard at this point. or maybe because i have 8383848383838383 thoughts i  my head and it's sometimes so exhausting and overwhelming ugh. let's go. i think I will try Wellbutrin then xD"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I was perscribed wellbutrin 300xl for severe depression but turns out I have adhd. I don't think it's helpe with either. I'm scared to ask to try ritalin because I'm really poor and the places available to me are on hyper guard for people asking for controlled substances. I'm at a loss and losing hope.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"How long you should take it before you see improvement? How do you take it? My doc said 3/day. Do you know if it works just for short term? let's say exams week, if so, how do you take it?"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I've been on wellbutrin for like 2 weeks now and ive had the worst side effects.   
I can't seem to go number 2 anymore, cause im constantly constipated and I just got my period early, very early. the last one ended on the 28th... just 2 weeks ago :/   
idk"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Heck yeah! I'm so glad you have found something that works for you! It can be such a struggle to find the right mix of medication. I took Adderall for a month and had such bad side effects I switched to Wellbutrin and it's been great for me!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Oh! I didn‚Äôt know that!! But yes, it‚Äôs so nice to finally be able to focus and be calm and god I love it. When I‚Äôm in college I tell my classmates they are my ‚Äúhappy pills‚Äù lol"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I am happy to hear that You found your medicine. Mine was Ritalin LA. Wellbutrin made me extremely anxious. We are different:)
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Right now, high dosages of nicotine are the only thing that keeps me studying..."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"that's great to hear about wellbutrin. can i ask, is it the only thing you're on for your adhd?"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Glad it worked for you to quit. I used Chantix and it worked until I stopped taking it. Wellbutrin didn‚Äôt do anything for me. Honestly best thing for me to stay smoke free was starting Adderall XR. I also stopped binge eating and binge drinking so win win for me!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Making the switch from Adderall to Ritalin did that to me. After months of almost zero libido it was very welcome but Ritalin made so much else worse so I stopped.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Some doctors will prescribe it off label for those with low libidos. I just take it for depression.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Yuuuup! I have a normally high drove, but holy shit wellbutrin made me insatiable."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Ohh that explains the past month
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"damn haha, I never had a problem with libido but I hope you found something!"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Ugh I was prescribed it because I had low sex drive but it didn‚Äôt do anything. Big bummer.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"It stopped me sleeping. After 4 days I was like, no more, please!"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I need some help with that.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I like your description better than mine - ‚Äúmy brain feels slower but like in a good way‚Äù
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,That‚Äôs so awesome to hear and I‚Äôm glad you got it figured out! Yeah it was absolutely amazing experience for me and my girlfriend was mentioning how much more focused and happier I got!! She also said I got a lot less chaotic lol
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I'm really worried one day they will have to take me off Vyvanse due to a heart issue. I'm OK so far, but I've had a few unusual ECGs sent off to cardiology. They've come back fine, but it still unnerves me a bit...Also, particularly as I'm one of a small portion  of people who have a weird delayed, but severe allergy to Wellbutrin....

Felt fine day 1.

Day two ...my thighs were oddly itchy at night.

Day three... my thighs were REALLY itchy at night.

Day four... called up my Psychaitrist who said it couldn't possibly be the Wellbutrin (despite the prescribing information indicating a risk)

Day six...75% of my skin was bright red, and hot to the touch. I was burning up, and had to go to emergency to get mega antihistamines, which thankfully stopped the reaction / any anaphylaxis.

Day 8...top layer of skin on my thighs peeled off like there had been a sunburn. 


(Subsequently found a lot stories of others who have had the same thing on Reddit)."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,My husband can‚Äôt stop eating due to the Wellbutrin. Dr refuses to take him off it. He‚Äôs gained easily 50 pounds in the past 2 years.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôve been on Wellbutrin XL for a week so far and maybe it‚Äôs placebo or I‚Äôm already feeling it. Your descriptions are perfect. Slowing down in a good way. Stimulant type meds really do slow down the mind of ADHD people. Ive been hesitant on meds my entire 32 years of living but wish I would‚Äôve done something sooner. I do think my life would be different and wouldn‚Äôt have spun out so many times. We all just want to be normal and not depressed as fuck humans. Meds word different for everyone but your reply hit home most.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,That‚Äôs awesome to hear!!! I‚Äôm glad it worked well for you and congrats on your cert!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Are you still on it?
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,EXACTLY everyone is so different and the key is having a great doctor that listens and cares
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Holy shit that sounds rough. I‚Äôm glad Ritalin is working now though! I‚Äôve been on Welbutrin for about a month now!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôve been on Adderall for years and started taking Wellbutrin along with it a few months ago for depression and I‚Äôm having a similar experience :/ the first ~2 months on 300mg were amazing. I was feeling so much better and getting so much done‚Ä¶ the last couple of months though I‚Äôve slipped back into my depression again and it‚Äôs so discouraging :(
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I had panic attacks after taking it steady for a few days. Most of this was during a tough time, grieving my mother's terminal diagnosis. I took a break then have tried it a few times, and while it helps my focus, motivation, mood and organisation, it makes me more emotionally unstable in some ways and argumentative with my spouse. And made me hot all afternoon! Is anything working better for you?"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I had a very similar experience with Lexapro! It made me extra anxious and I was scared of the dark. Which is a weird experience as an adult when I know there's not any reason to be afraid. I would also sleep with a light on sometimes. And I couldn't go in the garage to grab something from the car without having the lights on, even though that was something I did all the time before. It also gave me terrible driving anxiety. I would take the long way to places to avoid getting on the interstate whenever possible. This was years ago so I don't remember if it went away or if I stopped taking it after a while"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I take Adderall and got put on Wellbutrin. Like you, it worked great for the first few weeks. Like, amazing! But then I started getting angrier easier and easier and started feeling weird and disconnected from everything. Like I felt like nobody in my life really cared about me and I might as well be alone, etc etc. I went off it and started feeling better in a few days. It did seem to make me focus and feel really good at first, but it unfortunately changed."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I had the exact same experience on Wellbutrin!! Happy it works for some folks, but it took my chemistry & yeeted it."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,that‚Äôs currently me with the zoloft. i can‚Äôt be without my phone or i just get anxious. gonna have to stop taking it
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I take gabapentin for anxiety, and it works great! It helps me sleep when I take it in the evening, and I take a smaller dose if I need to when I'm super anxious. The only side effect is that I've experienced is that I have a really hard time getting out of bed in the morning because I relied on my anxiety to get me going lol"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"That‚Äôs what Wellbutrin was like for me. It was okay to start but by the time my one month follow up appointment happens I was feeling suicidal for the first time ever. 
I‚Äôm taking extended release adderallwith Lamotrigine which is a mood stabilizer and it keeps the adderall grounded."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,[removed]
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Hope you have a lock box yikes.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,IIRC anti depressants shouldn't be paired with stimulants (especially zoloft and ritalin) due to the increased risk of serotonin syndrome. It's entirely possible that you experienced those side effects because of drug interaction (in addition to it not being suitable for you).
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,It‚Äôs almost like: we have anxiety when our mind is so batshit drained that we can‚Äôt handle any tasks whatsoever
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Ha, ‚Äúneutral non-functioning‚Äù vs ‚Äúchaotic non-functioning‚Äù is such a great distinction"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Same but I just accepted it. I don't respond well to Adderall or Ritalin and besides Welbutrin, there aren't any other options, at least according to my psychiatrist. At least my emotions aren't as volatile anymore, with some exceptions.

I've just kinda slid into a state of accepted nothingness. I still like my Welbutrin, don't get me wrong, my emotions were all over the fucking place before. But I wish it did something for my executive dysfunction.

Disclaimer: this comment was written by a sad bitch with seasonal depression"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,">  it took away my anxiety but then I was just neutral non functioning instead of chaotic non functioning. It was odd.

Shit I think this is me right now, exactly.  
I'm currently undiagnosed (it's scheduled ...) and my psych gave me off-label wellbutrin. Feels better than without it but I'm not really content with how it's going."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,That is a great analogy and yes I‚Äôm very happy it worked for me!! I hope you found something that works as well!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,What does work for you? I‚Äôm trying to identify some new options.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Yeah my sisters doctor put her on it before trying anything else and she was a zombie. Made her feel terrible, and then since you can‚Äôt just stop without weaning she felt terrible for weeks trying to get off it.  It can be great but not for everybody and is serious meds so definitely not to be prescribed lightly!"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Yea it's a weird ass drug. I know what you mean ""neutral"" non functioning.. I still take adderall in combine with it to make me functioning."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,[removed]
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Oh my god I‚Äôm sorry to hear that :( did you find anything that worked for you? Have you told your doctor about that?
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Oh god that's how my migraines are
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Awee :( I‚Äôm really sorry to hear that and I hope you found something better!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"First day with it today and it's not giving me that... I'd say the psychological effects are actually good for the depression and ADHD. But, so far it's giving me anxiety and I just feel really fucking weird like my nerves are all fucked up or something."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Strangely enough (I actually don't think it's that strange for ADHD folks), Welbutrin has helped my sleep more than anything else I've ever tried.. instead of restless thoughts and an active mind for hours and hours, I get in bed and am ready for bed. 

Doesn't hurt it helps me consistently exercise as well. But wow my sleep was leagues better immediately. I even can take it before bed no problem."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,It will come!!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,That‚Äôs awesome!! I actually didn‚Äôt realize until later that Welbutrin was also used to quit smoking! I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs working and keep it up!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Same here with the Wellbutrin being the perfect med for my depression. I take Vyvanse for the ADHD. This combo is what keeps me alive lmao.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,That‚Äôs a great story!! I‚Äôm so happy for you! and I am glad it‚Äôs working!! It truly is a blessing that my doc was caring enough to go through multiple medications and sit down and talk with me of the course of the year
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Awe I‚Äôm really sorry to hear that. I hope your appointment goes well and please update me!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôm glad I could do that!ü•∫ I hope it works for you! and I hope everything gets better!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I heard that could happen as well. I‚Äôm sorry to hear that and I hope you are doing better! If you need to talk or vent, you can always message me and I‚Äôll be available!!"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I know your comment is 40d old but im cracking the fuck up for 'turned into kyle and punched through my door' üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Well it is a side effect but I haven‚Äôt experienced anything!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôm sorry to hear that :( did you end up finding something that worked?
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôd be curious too hear more about why it sucked and what you went on after and if that worked instead. Currently been on 100mg of welbutrin for a month plus adderall and I feel depressed and still have a really hard time focusing.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Could you describe your occasional OCD? 
I wasn't aware I had OCD until a few months ago, Idk if I have mild or severe OCD, I think it's more to do with how anxious i am, like I had insane stress levels the past year and my OCD was a motherfucker. It fucked me up HARD. It's never been that bad, so in that regard it was severe."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,It‚Äôs always worth a shot!! Ritalin gave me really bad shits and didn‚Äôt have much of an effect lol I‚Äôm glad you got it figured out and diagnosed!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Did you switch to wellbutrin with ritalin? If so, how's it going?"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I can give some advice, I would usually put my phone or something in a drawer far away before I started any assignments and I would make sure all distractions were clear! I also have headphones that I just put in and blast music to get into the zone. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing and it‚Äôs been helping for a while now, I‚Äôve been even able to concentrate with my phone next to me!"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,No it didn‚Äôt haha. I was able to consistently work on school projects and finish assignments over the course of these past few weeks
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Has Effexor been a good difference? I‚Äôm glad it helped and I‚Äôm sorry to hear about the Welbutrin!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,It‚Äôs been working really well but tbh I also realized I have an insane tolerance for medication. I was taking like 100mg of Zoloft at one point and it helped but not in the way I wanted and I was taking a shit ton of Ritalin too.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"This is exactly what happened to me. Was prescribed Wellbutrin to deal with anxiety/depression before I was diagnosed w/ ADHD.

Tried it for a few months and didn't notice much difference but figured it wasn't doing any harm, so might as well keep it up.

Then I started getting really irritable about everything. I didn't even notice it. My wife sat me down one day and was like, ""Hey, you're kinda being a dick to everyone. Are you okay?""

It was the Wellbutrin. Cycled off of it and totally back to normal."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Oh man :( I‚Äôm sorry to hear that but glad you figured it out!! I have a loving girlfriend and a good social network so if something does change I‚Äôm sure I will notice and they will tell me!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,So you are describing what I am experiencing now.      Slightest thing makes me freak. It‚Äôs not like me. Did the switch to just adderol help with that?
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I'm in the US, so I apologize for the dumb question. Here a doctor can prescribe a drug, like Wellbutrin for depression, to stop smoking, or low libido, but I pay the same price at the pharmacy with my insurance ($10 USD). Same price for off label use. When I pick it up, it just tells me to take 1 pill/day. 

What's the cost difference? How does the pharmacy know that you are taking it off label?"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôm sorry to hear that :( hopefully you find a workaround!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Awee :( I‚Äôm sorry to hear that and yeah I‚Äôm glad Welbutrin worked for me! I hope you found something better!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Thank you!! and I‚Äôm really happy you found what worked for you as well!! I always heard Adderall was supposed to me the ‚Äúdrug of all drugs‚Äù for ADHD but when I tried it, it literally did nothing and in fact actually made me more sleepy. So yeah. Anyways I‚Äôm glad you found something!!"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Awe ::(( that happened as well with me in regards to Adderall and Ritalin. Hope you find something that works!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Yeah!! Oh look, I need to do some assignments, BAM sat down for three hours and finished them. It was awesome!!"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Thank you! and yes that‚Äôs exactly how it felt! I‚Äôm still taking 25mg of Zoloft a day as well as 300mg of Welbutrin so it‚Äôs really nice to have my anxiety and adhd under control
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôm gonna have to agree with u/SmoresGirl. I‚Äôve been taking 2 150 mg tablets a day and it‚Äôs been doing wonders. I‚Äôve also been taking 25mg of Zoloft to ease some anxiety symptoms
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Not op but my doctor said Bupropion only really works for adhd at 300mg minimum.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Yeah, 150 helped my depression symptoms for about a week, and without making me sleepy all the time like my SSRIs. Going up to 300 made a way bigger difference and I think addresses *some* of my adhd. I've got an appointment a month from now to try to get on stimulants though."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I see! I hope you figure something out with your meds and you find something that works! It‚Äôs always a tough battle
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôm really happy I found it as well and I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs working for you too!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Same. It‚Äôs been incredible. Many of my friends take it actually. It‚Äôs also helpful when the nights get longer
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I understand!! I have actually been taking Welbutrin for about a month now and it still seems to be working. I just hoped my experience could help other!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,im over here on 300mg of it and its not helping much lol its supposed to help adhd???
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Yeah stopping smoking was what it‚Äôs generally supposed to help with. I‚Äôm sorry it didn‚Äôt work for you and I hope you find something!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Ooohh!!! I hope it works out well and please do update me!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I would say give it a shot!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Yeah I was super happy to try Aderall but it actually made me sleepy for some reason. I‚Äôm glad you found something that works on the first try!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôm glad your husband found something and hopefully you did as well!! I‚Äôm also really happy I finally found something
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Oh man, that sucks. Nice username though!"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôm sorry to hear that but I‚Äôm glad Concerta is doing well for you! and yes I‚Äôm happy it is working for me!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I hope so as well! and holy shit 10 years that‚Äôs incredible. I really hope this one sticks
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Awe :( that‚Äôs how I felt when I took Adderall and Methylphendate. It only gave me bad shits and did nothing for my concentration. I hope you found something better!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Exactly!! It was like your engine finally started and your true potential was able to be unlocked! Very good for me!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Well, I had really bad anxiety as well as on top of the ADHD and he figured if he treated my anxiety that maybe it could help me. It worked but over the course of a few months I still lacked the energy and motivation to focus so now I‚Äôm taking Zoloft and Welbutrin!"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Awe I‚Äôm sorry to hear that :( insomnia is definitely something that‚Äôs popping up a lot and I‚Äôm just glad I haven‚Äôt had any horrible side effecrs
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôve definitely heard a lot people mentioning having insomnia and I‚Äôm glad that wasn‚Äôt a side effect for me! I hope you found something to fit your needs!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Congrats to you for finding it as well!! Super happy I found something that works for once
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôm sorry to hear that. I hope you found something that worked for youü•∫ü•∫
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Yeah it really is helpful both for depression and getting your shit together. Made a big impact on me for sure
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Awe ::(( I‚Äôve definitely heard of people getting rashes and stuff like that and hopefully nothing happens in the next few months that I‚Äôm taking these medicines.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôm sorry to hear that but I am glad you are okay!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôve definitely heard people getting angry as a side effect to be pretty common.  I hope you found something that worked with both of those things and I‚Äôm very happy it works for me!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôm glad it helped!! What was the combo and how much of it were you taking??
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Yes of course!! I‚Äôm glad you found something and honestly some companies can be SUCH A PAIN IN THE ASS to get medication from. Glad you found something!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,This was really helpful and hilarious to boot.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôm glad you got adjusted and yeah I agree with that!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Yeah it really does make a incredible difference!! And I‚Äôll make sure to do that!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Glad you didn‚Äôt get any bad side effects though!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Hi!!! Yes it‚Äôs amazing, how is the experience for you so far?"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôm gladdd it hellppedd good job!!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Oh my god. I‚Äôm so sorry to hear that and I really do hope you found something better!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I had to switch over from Zoloft to Welbutrin and that transition took about 2 weeks. Then for it to finally start taking in took about another 2 it could be different for everyone but I would say a month five or take
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Holy shit that‚Äôs bad :(  I had taken Ritalin but it gave me hella shits, obviously not as bad as the insomnia but I was shitting like crazy on Ritalin lol"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Thank you!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Thank you very much :)
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Thank you!!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Thank you!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I still had terrible anxiety symptoms so my Doc allowed me to take 25mg of Zoloft to help combat that!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôve been hearing insomnia a lot and I‚Äôm sorry to hear that :( hopefully you found something though!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I really hope it works for you!! and I‚Äôm glad that I could make you hopeful!! Please update me!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Yeah it is really incredible. Adderall made me sleepy and gave me the shits. Ritalin did nothing and gave me the shits lol
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôm sorry to hear that :( I‚Äôm glad you found something that works though!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Oh my god I really hope you are doing better! and yeah sometimes these medications are super specific
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I don‚Äôt know. They are both two medications that work completely differently so that‚Äôs something you may have to ask your doctor.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Thank you!! and I have never heard of it either so it was a surprise when it worked!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Awe I‚Äôm sorry ): Welbutrin is actually an anti-depressant that I‚Äôve literally never heard of. Hopefully you find something that works!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Medication is always weird because it‚Äôs different with everyone please update me on how that goes!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,It‚Äôs actually mainly used as an anti-depressant!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Give it a shot and update me!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Yayayayayyya!!! I‚Äôm so happy for you too!! and yes uwu I‚Äôm very glad it works!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôm glad you found something that works!! and yes!! It can only go up from here!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Yess!!! I agreee completely. It has to be something everyone should try and it‚Äôs become a life changing medicine for me!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I was transitioning from Zoloft so I started at about 150 a week and then moved on to 300 a day
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Yes I agree! It is something that is overlooked and not considered as often! and yeah human beings are completely different in how we react to medications but it‚Äôs something we still should try!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Well, Initially I had complaints about really bad anxiety and my doc thought that if we focused on the symptoms that it would help with ADHD. It helped with the anxiety but not so much the focus. So now I‚Äôm taking 300 Welbutrin and 25 Zoloft"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Maybe a month? It hasn‚Äôt been long enough for me to FULLY gauge its effects but so far so good
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,We are different and it‚Äôs so interesting to me in how we react to medications. I‚Äôm glad you found something to work for you!! Amphetamines made me shit and sleep a lot lol
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,That‚Äôs definitely a side effect that‚Äôs pretty common in the comments below. I hope you found something else that works tho!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I just came off it this week because of blurred vision. It was kinda wacky. Otherwise it worked great, but it wasn‚Äôt worth the trade off. Hope you find something that works for you."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Awe :( I‚Äôm sorry to hear that and I hope you find that sweet spot of what works and what dosent!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Yep, anger definitely seems to be prettt common when taking it. I‚Äôve had no problems, hopefully you found something better!!"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Yeah it really is interesting especially after reading all of the comments. I hope you found something as well!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôm really glad it‚Äôs been helping you and hopefully you find something that figures out that weight loss!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Yayayayay!!! I‚Äôm glad you found something but unlike me, Welbutrin works for my anxiety AND adhd which is great tbh."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Yeah I also found that a lot of drugs don‚Äôt work on me and it‚Äôs really interesting as to how the human mind works and I‚Äôm glad you found something that works!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Happy for you too!! Glad it helped!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,YESSS SAMMEE!! I‚Äôm really happy it‚Äôs been working
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Hopefully you found something as well!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,That‚Äôs awful to hear but I‚Äôm glad you found something that works!! Modern Medicine is amazing
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I also sometimes forget to take it but when I do goddamn does it remind me by giving me insane anxiety
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôm glad you found something that works!! and yeah I was so disappointed. I took some Adderall and. then promptly fell asleep IN CLASS lol
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,That could be possible but it could also be you still haven‚Äôt found the right medicine. Keep trying and I‚Äôm sure you will find something out!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"It depends how it feel I guess.. my doc said.. you‚Äùll know when it ‚Äúworks‚Äù for you‚Ä¶ never had that feeling with Ritalin, kinda had it with dexamphetamine but I had to take more each time.. guess that was my addictive side.. till I kind of crashed..  felt horrible.. got in touch with my doc.. had to quit right away.. cold turkey.. for 2 weeks.. those days were the worst.. so everyone reacts differently.. and for the first time, I knew something worked for me, was when I tried Intuniv."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôm glad you found something to help!! Hopefully you find something to help with the ADHD
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,YEAH!! GO WELBUTRINN
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôm glad you found a combo!! Methylphenidate made me shit real bad and did nothing regarding my focus so I‚Äôm glad you found something!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I‚Äôm glad you found something!! for me, when I tried Adderall it was so disappointing, I took it in the morning before class and I promptly fell asleep!!"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Awe I‚Äôm sorry to hear that :( hopefully you found something tho!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I see!glad you found a good combo anyways!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I hope it gets better for you or you find something else!! and thank you!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôm glad to see it helped with the depression and hopefully you find something for the ADHD!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,You still can!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,You should try it out!! Give it a shot and update me!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Oh my god I‚Äôm really sorry to hear that, hopefully you find something tho!!"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Yes!! I was dissapointed but I‚Äôm glad I found something!!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Yeah and out of all the responses here, it seems to go only one way either good or bad. I‚Äôm glad it works and it‚Äôs very interesting to see the others here"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Yeah, I didn‚Äôt like add too much as well, hopefully you find something that works!!"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Awe I‚Äôm sorry :( hopefully you found something that worked tho!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Glad you found something that works!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,150 two times a day as well as 25 mg of Zoloft
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Glad you found something that works!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Awe I‚Äôm sorry and thank you!! I hope you found something as well!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Awee I‚Äôm sorry :( hopefully everything goes well!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I thought taking addys would be the miracle drug but it literally did nothing
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Yeah it is!! (Used to be Christian but not anymore)  so happy holidays!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I would say give it a full month or teo
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,A week isn‚Äôt nearly enough to get a full effecr
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,About a month
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Close to a a month now!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Hope you found something!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôm sorry ::((  I‚Äôm really glad I found something as well!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,YEAHH!! GO WELBUTRRINNNN how much are you taking and how long have you been taking it?
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I was on 150 for about a week and that was so I could ease away from the Zoloft. Now I‚Äôm doing 150 twice a day and it‚Äôs working pretty well!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,NOOOOO SO CLOSEEEüò≠üò≠üò≠ hopefully you found something tho!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Yeah I heard about bad side effects as well but I‚Äôm glad I haven‚Äôt experienced it!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,WELBUTRRINN GANNGG
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Yeah it‚Äôs really interesting how the human mind works lol
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Awe ::( hopefully you found something tb
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Has literally done nothing. No bad side effects whatsoever on my end so it‚Äôs doing well!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,It trulllyy is and I‚Äôm super happy for you!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,If it wears off I‚Äôll have to try it!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôm sorry to hear that :( hopefully you found something tho!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôve heard of other people having their hair fall out and I‚Äôm sorry :( hopefully you are better and found something!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Yeah there seems to be no in between. It‚Äôs either amazinf or complete hell lol. Glad I got the good side!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,YAYAYAY CHEERRRSS do you mind updating me on how it goes for you?ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Yeah and if it really has bad symptoms then stop but don‚Äôt be afraid to take the final step!!! You got this!!! I am currently taking 150mg twice a day!! Also!! Do you mind updating me on when you start taking it?ü•∫ü•∫
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôm not technically of age (I‚Äôm 19) but I heard from a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù of mine who somehow coincidentally also take the same medicine and dosage as I do. He says it dosent really make you too sick and if you are just a casual drinker you should be okay. It can differ to person to person tho. That‚Äôs what my ‚Äúfriend‚Äù said lol
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Yes it is!!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,2-3 weeks until I started feeling the full effects
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Haven‚Äôt had any weight gain whatsoever
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,150 twice a dY
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I‚Äôm so happy for you, that‚Äôs great! I‚Äôve read on this sub that others have had negative experiences sharing that they‚Äôre on meds to others, they‚Äôve been asked to sell, or have had their meds stolen. Best of luck with your schooling! As a college prof, it fills me with joy when students find resources and supports that work for them, and find their stride."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"OG Wellbutrin was used primarily for smoking cessation, IIRC!"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,How long did you take them before noticing improvement?
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,what dose are you on?
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,My time on Wellbutrin gave me stress hives. Everyone reacts differently!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Nicotine itself isn‚Äôt necessarily bad, other than being addictive. Tobacco on the other hand is poison."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Replying to an old comment here:
>Right now, high dosages of nicotine are the only thing that keeps me studying...

From what I've read, Wellbutrin(Bupropion) makes use of the brain's nicotinic receptors, so if nicotine works well for you, you might also get good results from Wellbutrin. 

disclaimer: I'm not a health professional"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"It has been in the past. For the past few years I‚Äôve also been on a low dose of Adderall XR as well. But now that I no longer have a job that requires me to be highly focussed all day long, I‚Äôll probably be stopping the Adderall soon. When I skip the Adderall on weekends I still notice the Wellbutrin working quite well on its own. I don‚Äôt want to be on stimulants forever, and I can tell that Wellbutrin alone keeps my symptoms under control enough for me to function quite well. For those who are hesitant about stimulants (which is smart), I always recommend trying Wellbutrin first."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,It‚Äôs funny how each person‚Äôs body is so different. Adderall made me want to smoke.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Do you still drink?
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Wait: there are people with ADHD that aren‚Äôt inveterate horndogs?

Edit: I‚Äôm actually serious. Getting off is the ultimate quick-hit immediate reward that our brain chemistry reinforces and there are a lot of issues in our population with risky sexual behaviors and infidelity."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Ritalin made me angry as fuck coming down from it, which isn't good because I already have anger issues.

I remember walking around a store when people weren't wearing masks pre-vaccines and being damn near ready to attack them, despite being a generally reserved introvert.

Can't stand Ritalin's come-down effect on me."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,It's often coupled with fluoxetine (Prozac) for depression to counteract the anhedonia and fatigue which are fairly common side effects.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Yes that was the case with me. Sadly it didn‚Äôt work.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,">‚Äúmy brain feels slower but like in a good way‚Äù

perfect description!"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,That's horrifying! I hope the Vyvanse continues to be beneficial and doesn't affect your heart...
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,It is so weird to me how differently we all respond to the same med. I lost 25#on wellbutrin.   It was going great until recently for me. I‚Äôm on 225mg and am unable to handle my normal day to day stuff.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Ask him to use metformin , if instant release doesn't work then sustained release , I am using the same to balance the ravenous hunger"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Yes I am.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,[deleted]
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I‚Äôm glad to see it‚Äôs been a month. I was worried you were still in the first few days. I think the first 3-5 days were the best, most productive days of my life."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Is your depression seasonally affected? Mine is and I brought up to my psychiatrist worsening symptoms of depression one fall, he said that even though I‚Äôm medicated it‚Äôs not uncommon to experience a little slump at season change and that it should pass. And it does. So now I just kind of prepare myself for it, and push through it, it doesn‚Äôt last long, and then I‚Äôm better again. 

I think my fear was ‚ÄúOh no, my medications aren‚Äôt working I‚Äôm going to slide into major depression!‚Äù But I didn‚Äôt."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôve been on 450 mg with adderall 20 mg for years.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Welbuterin should probably be microdosed. The leo and logevity has a series on youtube about it.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,[deleted]
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"It made me edgy and irritable for 2-4 weeks while my brain adjusted to it. Then it just sorta flattened my moods a bit in all directions. I've weaned off it once or twice and each time found that taking the edge off my negative emotions helped much more than taking the edge off my positive emotions hurt, so I was much better on balance. So I'm on it for the long haul.

The one thing I never grew out of was daily headaches and exhaustion as it wore off in the late afternoon. Eventually I found if I delayed my focalin until lunch, it would still be in my system during the wear-off -- and boom -- no more headaches.

So basically my mornings aren't very productive -- I find the Wellbutrin is only about a quarter as effective as the focalin. But it does help. And having both in my system in the afternoon means I get enough done every day to have a happy boss."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Damn same here haha. Struggle bus getting up in the morning for sure

Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Wellbutrin affects levels of dopamine and norepinephrine, not serotonin unlike SSRIs, so it‚Äôs safer with stimulants"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Awww, I feel you. I‚Äôll take better regulated emotions any day, that‚Äôs primarily why I take my meds. But yeah it sucks when you also can‚Äôt focus or start tasks. *hugs* we‚Äôll get there!!"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Have you tried Strattera? Mr dr mentioned that and Wellbutrin were non stimulants.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Vyvance may be an option.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Intuniv + Wellbutrin, works for me. Wellbutrin the feeling is just kinda neutral, but I like it.. it really didn‚Äôt help adhd wise‚Ä¶ and since my hyperactivity is my main issue‚Ä¶ my doc introduced intuniv, now I‚Äôm on 4mg. It‚Äôs the best thing i‚Äôve tried so far.. my mind is finally clear, got focus and it was worth all the side-effects Ive had to get through‚Ä¶"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I‚Äôm on regular old Adderal XL right now, which seems to work best for me at the moment"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Nope, never had a seizure before. Even coming off substances. It was weird"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Umm yes vyvanse worked for me. I take a low dose of Prozac as well and gabapentin
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I sleep fine at night on wellbutrin but only if I take the med in the morning.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Thank you! 

That is a very good doctor! 

I‚Äôm a nurse and I see it all the time, patients are put on 1 antidepressant (usually a low dose of an SSRI), usually it‚Äôs a sub therapeutic dose, then the doctor never really asks questions about how well it‚Äôs working at follow-up, and the patient thinks that‚Äôs as good as it gets. 

It takes a lot of trial and error to find the correct antidepressant and the correct dose! 
I encourage everyone to keep looking if one drug doesn‚Äôt work! 
And often family doctors are not well prepared to prescribe for chronic depression or depression with comorbidities. 
I have gotten much better care from a psychiatrist."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Appointment was as to be expected, he upped my Wellbutrin, lexapro is still the same, see how that goes.

Quick discussion on my addiction to chaos and the endorphin rush I get from it as to why I had let myself leave so late, and then get lost, before we said our goodbye and I left.

Not sure if he is the correct doctor, it is the best hospital in the city for mental health, so I am perservering. I think most of my recent issues have stemmed from covid breaking my routines, which has sent everything into a bit of a spiral."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"It was 25 years ago. I‚Äôm fine these days, but I‚Äôve never had to have a gun wrestled from my hands before, or since then. I was holding a gun to my head in front of my mother at 8 years old fully intending to pull the trigger. My dad tackled me. I don‚Äôt exactly remember the rest of the day, but I was taken off the pills immediately."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Nice
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"For me when they increased my dose from 150 to 300 my driving was impaired which was really scary, but im back on 150 now"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Mine is also related with my anxiety levels. The worst period was between 18-20. I couldn‚Äôt sleep before unplugging every single electronic device and putting all the frames down off the wall. Also I was trying to secure every furniture in my room that can fall down while I was sleeping. I was putting everything back in their places in the morning. One night, I couldn‚Äôt sleep because I was afraid of the curtain rod could fall down on my head. So I took my pillow to the foot side of my bed. Still wasn‚Äôt able to sleep because this time the hanging bookcase scared me. So I decided to meditate. I sat down, lit up some candles and incense. This time I felt like incense smoke was suffocating me. I gave up. Blowed out the candles and went to another room, hoping I might sleep. But I had to get back and check the candles, again, and again. After checking 5 times (and still worrying) I took all the candles to bathroom. Filled up the sink, put all the candles in the water and felt slightly less worried. Those 2 years were the worst. For the last 15 years it‚Äôs almost gone. It only reminds itself when I‚Äôm too anxious. Once in every 3-4 years. And it‚Äôs milder like checking door of my apartment or my car several times, taking picture of the iron after unplugging it, stocking food, detergents, shampoos and unnecessary stuff (which are basically trash). It can last just a few days or a couple of weeks but no longer. It goes away on its own when my anxiety level drops."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Thanks for checking. Actually, I have an appointment with my doctor in 2 hours. I‚Äôll definitely let you know if he agrees switching. I also want to talk to him about Concerta. And something else for helping me sleep. We‚Äôll see what happens."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,[deleted]
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,So far I‚Äôve noticed it helping quite a bit! I think once I finally phase the Zoloft out it‚Äôll be better - right now I can definitely tell when I‚Äôve taken the Effexor and when I‚Äôve taken the Zoloft.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I‚Äôm so glad you have a supportive network to help you keep an eye on these things! Best of luck, I‚Äôm so so glad it‚Äôs helping you!!!!"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Yeah. It‚Äôs a really common reaction. Getting off the Wellbutrin is what helped, but I did switch to adderall directly after and did not have similar problems."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,[deleted]
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôm liking Vyvanse a lot more than adderall
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôm 33 and I started a master‚Äôs certificate so this will be interesting to see how it compares to my undergrad studies. Lol.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,[deleted]
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Ah fuck. That's why it isn't working for me then. It wasn't prescribed for ADHD though.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Will do.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Ah yeah, pretty long time. But I should add, I am medicated out the ass and on what I‚Äôve been told is the highest dosage."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I did, Vyvanse helps me quite a bit."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"My only fear is eventually it wears off. And this is the only class of drug they made with this type of drug 

I really hope someday they make more"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Just keep track of yourself for sure. I really hope it works for you, and it works for a lot of people, but it made me borderline suicidal after a while too"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I think we‚Äôre opposite because Adderall helped along with a small does of stratera. I finally feel great! So glad Wellbutrin is working for you!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I did, thank you! It was a journey, but I got there. I'm now in a place where I can start focusing on improving my life instead of just trying to get it to a ""neutral"" point lmao ü§£ 

It's good to share the positive experiences with medication, so thank you for doing that :) It can bring hope to people that are still struggling with treatment! :)"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Addy 25mg xr, trintrillix 20mg, bruproprion(Wellbutrin) 300 mg xr and 100mg ir"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Also isn‚Äôt it wild that each of these meds work differently for people?  Wellbutrin didn‚Äôt help my ADHD but Wellbutrin helped you with it.  I have a few friends who tried the wrong meds and quit.  We need to be more open about it instead of going along with the stigma that meds don‚Äôt work.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Me too! Straterra messed me up lol.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I did 2 weeks of the starter dose. And I only had 3 days of 300mg. I think it's helping a bit. Night school starts Wednesday. If I don't feel tortured and zone out, I may have found the right medicine first try... But we shall see.
Thanks for asking!"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"No, but I'm okay with that. Thank you."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,IMO the shits are a bonus hahahaha
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I stopped that one immediately!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Yup im aware I had it prescribed for depression. Also had it prescribed for ADHD too in the past, it helps a lot with both for me!"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I just got my official ADHD diagnosis in therapy, so now I have to talk it over with the psychiatrist. So hopefully I'll find something that won't be too detrimental."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Eh working on it
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Oh I was too! Ugh! Exactly. I thought yay a wonderdrug for all the symptoms. Noooope. Its been a Rollercoaster and I'm so glad to be nearing the end. If I can help anyone at all so they don't have to do 9 months of being a walking medicine cabinet I'll be happy. Good luck!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,It‚Äôs wild how much variance there is between all of our shambling corpses.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I will see if Concerta works for me (which it seems to be doing so far)!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Ahh okay! Was it sudden or just building up?
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"100 mgs 3x a day, i try to remember every dose but...ya know lol ive been on it since 2018 ironically to quit smoking"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Cool! I‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôve found something that helps! Even though I already have a psychiatrist, my insurance is making me go through my PCP first. I‚Äôm looking forward to a bit of chemical assistance, myself. :)"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Oh, yes, good ol Adderall üôÇ God sent. Thank you!"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Absolutely!! I have a terrible cold rn and haven‚Äôt been on it long, but once it starts kicking in I will let you know ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Thanks. I was on SSRIs and would vomit profusely off of one drink. I have misophonia which is (potentially) linked to adhd and I‚Äôd like to try wellbutrin - I just don‚Äôt want to yak 10 times after a margarita üòÇ
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Thank you! and yes I am so happy it is working for me. Finally glad I could find something!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I just want to add on that I‚Äôm a teacher too and OP, what great news! Student successes are the best and are what keep us going.

I was officially diagnosed with ADHD myself recently, and just got an Rx for Wellbutrin today. I hope I have as good an experience as you have!"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"No, buprioprion was invented in 1985 as an antidepressant. In 1997 Zyban came to market. ""Wellbutrin"" has *always*and still is primarily used as an antidepressant."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,It was actually used as an anti-depressant and also still being used as a cessation to stop smoking but it is not it‚Äôs primary use!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,They figured out quitting smoking was a side effect when they had patients who were taking it for depression figure out they no longer craved cigarettes. It stimulates the same center of your brain as smoking.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Interestingly: its the only use prescribed in AU to this day. It can be prescribed off label for Depression but it costs hundreds of $$
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I started noticing about a month but one day I forgot my meds and holy shit I didn‚Äôt know how I survived without it
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Indeed!üòä
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Not true, nicotine itself is toxic to your cardiovascular system and has negative effects on other aspects of your physiology.

Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Yes, but it cost a lot. I tried to quit last month and sadly if I want to keep my performance, I have to vape."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Wellbutrin is a stimulant based antidepressant. ;-)
Thats why it works so well for people with adhd."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,thank you! i'm trying to weigh out different medication options and this is helpful.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I have maybe 1 drink every 2-3 months.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Yeah, I have a low libido. Many women need to be able to concentrate to have an orgasm so sex for women with ADHD can be disappointing, as well. It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me to find out that women with ADHD have lower sex drives than NTs."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,For some reason I have a low sex drive. :( I don‚Äôt know what it is.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I have a pretty low libido but it‚Äôs probably just because I‚Äôm depressed
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,[removed]
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I find out a little more about myself seems like everyday from this sub. And I‚Äôm not alone! Cheers.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,yes
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I have a hyperactive libido for sure. It's kind of embarrassing. I wish there was more research on this.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I‚Äôm ace and don‚Äôt quite understand the point of recreational sex, it seems like way more hassle than the payoff is worth. So nope, no inveterate horndogging here."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Seriously? I might need to ask my psychiatrist to change my meds. I'm on Ritalin and I can think coherently with it, but that's it. It did make me a bit more outgoing but not much else.

I'm now starting to wonder if my main issue ISN'T time management, but something else. Unless I need something stronger than Ritalin because, I'll admit, it's not the first time I've taken a dose with an energy drink to get myself properly motivated.

Excuse me whilst I go write this down for my next appointment."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"My partner was the same, until he coupled it with Intuniv. It was a game changer. Rage completely gone, but personality stayed the same."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Huh. I may need to talk to my doctor. I‚Äôve been having anhedonia issues but ignoring it because it‚Äôs still a huge improvement over my previous headspace.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I've been off and on Wellbutrin for depression. My libido was down during Covid. Doctor put me in Wellbutrin off label to help. Didn't boost libido, but I've been feeling a lot better. Never had an issue with fatigue, but a few nights a month I have a hard time falling asleep."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Ditto. But it has helped with depression!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"He‚Äôs on Metformin ER. He‚Äôs also diabetic, so it‚Äôs frustrating. Regular metformin made sick past the initial 2-3 week phase of your body adjusting so he couldn‚Äôt tolerate the IR formulation."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,What dose? How many years you been on it
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"That‚Äôs my experience as well. When I first started taking it, it worked wonders but that eventually leveled off to what you describe as base level functionality. I wish it worked for me long term :("
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I hope it lasts long term and I‚Äôm glad it has at least some effect!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I see! Glad you figured something out and I hope this one lasts!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Def consider vitamin D supplementation if you aren't already; can be a major factor in seasonal depression.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Well that's interesting to hear considering I've been on a 450mg daily dose for the past year üò≥
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,My psych has me on SR 150mg taken twice a day to avoid that afternoon crash. This is in addition to Adderall through
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"You're correct, my bad. It's not an SSRI"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Thank you :) My psych said mixing Welbutrin and Adderall was too dangerous so she wouldn't let me, but I'm kinda like ??? because I see people here talking about being prescribed both regularly."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Psych said my only option left was Welbutrin. I don't even know if Strattera is common or available where I live tbh.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"My psych said there aren't any other options. I'm not sure if it's just different in my country or she doesn't want to prescribe it to me. She makes me feel I have to earn my medication (she told me to see the positive sides of winter when I said I get seasonal depression and get suicidal).

Either way my treatment is ending so I won't be able to speak to that or another psychiatrist without waiting for at least a year anyway üôÉ"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,That‚Äôs great!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"My PCP was INCREDIBLE with everything. If the Ritalin didn‚Äôt work he would up the dose and see if that did anything. If not, we switch over and try something else and play around with dosages. I could also message him any time regarding any questions so I‚Äôm super grateful to have him!"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Thank you for the update!! I hope he is the right doctor!! I wish you the best of luck on your journey and you got this!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,[deleted]
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Oh my godü•∫Im glad you are still here and alive!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Yeah feels the same. So when did you go on Ritalin? I'm afraid Ritalin may exacerbate my OCD symptoms :/
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Thanks!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Give it a shot and tell me if it works!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Same to you!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Damn. I am in India and started taking wellbutrin even without a prescription (just told the pharmacy guy I need it for smoking issues) and for me a 2 month supply(150sr twice a day) costs around 25 dollars. Even if you consider the currency exchange rate that's quite cheap. No wonder you western folks have insurance covering everything. Otherwise it would be quite expensive
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Good Luck on your studies!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Yep it stil does!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôm glad!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I really hope so as well and I do not want this to wear off tbh. I hope this helps me long term
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I will make sure of that and hopefully you found something!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Yeah, I‚Äôm glad you found something tho!"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Yes!! We are all in this together!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôm sorry :( hopefully you feel better!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,That‚Äôs what I thought but I was going to the bathroom at least 2 times an hour lol
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I would hope so!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôm happy for you!!! Please update me!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôm glad!! Good luck on your journey!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,It can totally depend on the person tho and I‚Äôll just keep that in mind but yeah I didn‚Äôt vomit at all- or wait my friend never vomited while taking it.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I could have sworn they still market Buprioprion as a smoking cessation aid in addition to the antidepressant side.  However it gets rounded up I think the big takeaway should be that we‚Äôre happy OP is seeing results.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"That‚Äôs right! 
I read somewhere that when it first came out there were a series of people having seizures on it, because doctors were prescribing to patients with eating disorders. 
Wellbutrin was pulled from the market, then Prozac hit the market. Once Prozac hit the market the Wellbutrin never got the attention it deserved.

Edit: correction of horrible grammar."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"When I first read about ADHD and how your nervous system is always in anxiety mode, its not surprisind that so many ADHD people smoke as the calming effect on the nerves is great, until it wears off of course."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Depends where you are. Not the case in the UK.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Currently using it for both of the above, I'm undiagnosed but suspect I have ADHD and I do feel I function slightly better with my dose."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I feel so much better after quitting a decade long vaping habit. I also got on medication for my ADHD though. Would still be vaping if not for that. Was definitely self-medicating with nicotine.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"It can have a mild stimulant effect on some (it does not with me), but it is certainly not in the category of stimulant medications like Adderall.

Edit: I shouldn‚Äôt have said you‚Äôre incorrect. My reply is just clarifying yours. üôÇ"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Glad I could help! üôÇ
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,So you are purposely very mindful?  I lived with a ‚Äúrecovered‚Äù alcoholic. She would have like one single drink twice a year.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I have high libido even when not on meds- I could have sex everyday. (I'm a woman)
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"As a woman with ADHD this is the opposite of my experience. Unless I've been on a relationship with someone I'm just settling for or isn't going well, but that only meant I just wasn't able to get into it with them. By myself was and has never been an issue, even at those times."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,That‚Äôll do it.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,It‚Äôs not ‚Äújust a theory‚Äù that we have lower amounts of things like dopamine and norepinephrine in our brains. Behavioral conditioning isn‚Äôt really a theory either.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Adderall helps me the most, by the way."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Can you tell me more about his rage?  I have adhd and GAD and for a while everything was great on wellbutrin, but recently (last 3 -4 weeks) I‚Äôve been such a bitch. And I don‚Äôt intend to be, but any little snafu or ‚Äúthing not going according to plan‚Äù or difficult‚Äù and I have a meltdown.   I full on had to remove myself from my houseguests and then flipped out when they came to check in me. 

I almost yelled at my kid today for misplacing one of his snow boots. 

This is not normal me."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Yeah, the bupropion is definitely more on the side of insomnia than fatigue. It's interesting to me that it's prescribed to treat the fatigue fluoxetine can cause. So another antidepressant to counteract the bad effects of the first one. 

Spouse was prescribed buspirone to help with the ADHD, off label of course. It didn't do much to help him. I kind of wonder if maybe the better bet would have been bupropion. But the anxiety as a potential side effect might have deterred the doc."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Thank you! I have been inconsistent with my vitamin d supplementation, I needed that extra push."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Indeed, I've been on 300mg for 15+ years."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Highly doubt that some random redditor knows better than your doctor.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôm so sorry.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Oddly enough no, I wasn't addicted to them at all. I was taking a lot of other stimulants, psychoactives, benzos etc at the time, but not addicted to the stims.

I stopped taking them because I was doing stupid things like staying up for days on end then remembering to take them, which resulted in further days awake.

I decided that it would be better to be straighten up if I was going to use them again. Roll on 20 years and for the most part, I've learned various strategies that keep me on top, but COVID has thrown them all out the window. 

so now I find myself trying to convince the doctor that a short blast back on Concerta with a bit of CBT for good measure should kick me back on track. 

I hate feeling like this, but I know I can get myself back on track, however I have to play the doctor juggle just now. 

It's really frustrating, I learned to live with my ADHD, I worked hard to get routines in place that allowed me to function, train my family up to know how to manage me in certain situations, but that has all gone."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,I‚Äôm on Ritalin just for 2 months now. I can say it definitely didn‚Äôt make my OCD worse. My main concern with Ritalin is mood swings.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I‚Äôm just back from doctor‚Äôs office. Well I guess I‚Äôm properly fucked! I was on 2 different meds. *Medikinet* (a brand name of extended release Methylphenidate, I guess it‚Äôs like Concerta), and *Trintellix* (Vortioxetin). And now he added 3 more drugs. 150 mg Wellbutrin, 10 mg instant release Ritalin and 0.5 mg Xanax (in addition to my current medication). Now I have 5 of them. Not sure if he‚Äôs trying to help or wants to fry my brain altogether."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Were you experiencing a lack of sexual attraction before the meds ?
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Oh my god thats so bad hahaha
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"They do, the other person is incorrect."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,They do; other user is mistaken. Bupropion binds with your nicotinic receptors and blocks the effects of nicotine.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I read it was dosage (300mg, directly dumped into the system, not extended release) plus eating disorders that were causing the seizures. The XR is considered safer per my doctor."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Randomly passing through, just saw your avatar and had a doppelganger moment. o\_\_\_o   


""F... flatironed me?"""
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,">  its not surprisind that so many ADHD people smoke as the calming effect on the nerves is great

That's actually just being addicted to nicotine and getting anxiety when you go into withdrawals within hours. It just calms your nerves wanting a cigarette."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,That‚Äôs interesting!! Thanks for sharing!!
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I know you wrote this a long time ago, but I have to say, I think the reason it doesn‚Äôt have a stimulating affect on you is because you have ADHD..
I have ADHD and have had a slight stimulated affect while my body was acclimating to the medication, but once I‚Äôm used to it, I‚Äôm just able to be focused and finish tasks..
I take 300 mgs of Wellbutrin XL and 40 mg of Vyvanse in the morning and once they kick in, I actually have an appetite and really could have a nap if I wanted too, but that would be silly as it‚Äôs when my brain is in peak mode to do the things I don‚Äôt want too usually lol.
I think that‚Äôs how you know if someone really has ADHD, if we were to stay stimulated like someone who doesn‚Äôt, we wouldn‚Äôt be prescribed them"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"No it‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm mindful. I just don‚Äôt want or feel a need to drink anymore. When I do have a drink, it‚Äôs often a celebratory drink like for a birthday or whatever but after 1 drink I‚Äôm good. I still occasionally am like ‚ÄúI could go on a bender‚Äù but then I‚Äôll think about that and argue myself out of it, and in turn not touch a single drop. I‚Äôve had 3 bottles of booze plus at least 18 cans/bottles of beer/hard seltzer in my apartment for months and haven‚Äôt touch any of it."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I mean, that‚Äôs why I said ‚Äúmany‚Äú and ‚Äúcan‚Äù. It‚Äôs my experience and I‚Äôve seen enough articles that jibe with my experience for me to suspect it‚Äôs common."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,[removed]
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I don't think Adderall is available in my country, but I'll ask my psychiatrist next time I see him. We were discussing having me switch to Concerta so this may be an opportune time to talk about it. Thanks!"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I've attached a fantastic podcast episode, with a specialist psychiatrist explaining emotional dysregulation in ADHD. It helped me understand so much better. 

https://pca.st/episode/11197363-289e-4757-af66-cc2f1e9c726a

It could be connected to rejection sensitivity. That's what it is for my partner. If he perceives rejection in any way, even if he feels ashamed in himself, he becomes very emotionally unstable. He almost feels physical pain when he feels rejected. It's unbearable.

Its completely out of character for him. He will drink. Yell at me. Throw or break things. The things he yells about are old grievances. Anything really. Sometimes it doesn't make any sense. I have come to realise the words don't matter, he is just hurting so badly he can't control what he says or does.

The Intuniv has really helped. He hasn't had an anger outburst since starting it."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Late to the party, did the Vitamin D help out? Another tip I got from my psychologist is light therapy. Going to try it the coming winter \^\^"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"awesome! and i'd think wellbutrin could level out the mood swings, I'm on it and it feels like my mood is stable and I feel like my emotions have flattened"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Haha, gl. Would love to hear how you feel on them"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Any updates?
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,No I wasn‚Äôt! I actually got a girlfriend before I was on the meds and we are currently about a year in together.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Yes, it most definitely is."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Its just different brand names really.   Neither of you is *wrong per se
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I also think as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, bupropion can help with other dopamine-seeking activities. For me personally it reduced my craving for alcohol."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,That‚Äôs what I thought just didn‚Äôt have time to stop and double check. I stand by it being more important that anyone be correct about Wellbutrin‚Äôs other uses and more important that op has seen results but thanks for the additional fact check.  Have a great evening
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,but when you smoke it for the first time you still get relaxed right? so it suggests to me that it's more than just getting rid of the stress that you want another one.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Wow that‚Äôs awesome. I‚Äôve had some trouble with alcohol. Don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll go back to drinking. I had half a bottle of vodka. I thought I could get drunk with it and then quit drinking. I was nah I‚Äôm done. Poured it down the sink and quit drinking for good. I sure do miss those hoppy IPAa.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Maybe try reading medical literature on the subject before making this the hill you die on.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Thank you for sharing this with me. I‚Äôm going to listen to this tonight.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Idk, my ADHD got the best of me and I forgot to start it."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Good to hear that. I‚Äôll ask my doctor about it. I hope it helps.
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"I think it‚Äôs too early to say something about Wellbutrin yet. But I can say that I didn‚Äôt notice any nasty side effects, just a very light headache. Instead of 3x10 long release Ritalin, 1x30 mg long release in the morning and 10mg instant release afternoon worked better for me. Less emotion/anxiety ups and downs. And Xanax helps me sleep. The only thing that worries me is taking too many different meds. But since they‚Äôre all prescribed, I must be safe (I guess)."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Oh, and thanks for asking!"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Oh to be clear, that is also true. It is also a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor as well. It has a very unique receptor affinity profile."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,">but when you smoke it for the first time you still get relaxed right? so it suggests to me that it's more than just getting rid of the stress that you want another one.

I mean, you get a nicotine buzz which makes you feel good. It's not usually a feeling of relaxation at first though. More of a nice little rush."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"My dad was an alcoholic before I was born, he drinks non-alcoholic beer because he misses the flavor. Maybe there‚Äôs a non alcoholic version you can have?"
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,[removed]
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,Thank you for sharing. üòä
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"The first few times I smoked cigarettes the ""buzz"" was so good I could barely move. Tobacco is indeed a stimulant which as we know has the opposite effect with ADHD as with non ADHD."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"Dude, they can literally measure dopamine activity in the brain with MRI. I‚Äôve done postgraduate work on ADHD and am doing a project on this for work translating the research into something educators can use. These data support a lot of what was hypothesized beforehand. 

They‚Äôre not going to throw us all into an MRI to confirm a diagnosis when clinical evidence is incredibly reliable."
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,[removed]
Wellbutrin is THE FUCKING SHIT,"You‚Äôre arguing like a creationist and show a misunderstanding of what the word theory means in science. 

Theory in science means ‚Äúaccurate working mode with a large body of evidence supporting it.‚Äù Gravity is a theory. Evolution is a theory. Relativity is a theory.  

We know how behavioral conditioning works. There‚Äôs clinicians like psychologists and applied behavioral analysts doing work on the clinical side. Then neuropsychiatrists started working on the brain chemistry side of things after effects of stimulant medications were observed. 

The literature I‚Äôve been reviewing uses fMRI scans to measure the activity in areas of the brain that are associated with ADHD, dopamine, reward, etc. They use PET scans to narrow in on specific markers. Every study I‚Äôve read shows less activity and fewer markers for dopamine in those with ADHD compared with those without.  

If most experiments confirm prior results or apply new technology and give us new information in line with the theoretical understanding, that shows the theory is pretty damn solid. That is why the lower neurotransmitter theory of ADHD is what has the most acceptance."

Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,I take Wellbutrin and stimulants for my ADHD and it‚Äôs a good combo for me but Wellbutrin on its own would not address my pretty severe inattentiveness. I do find that Wellbutrin helps with mood swings and helps temper the irritability that comes when my ADHD meds wear off. The crash isn‚Äôt severe as long as I‚Äôm eating small meals throughout the day.
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,i did not do well on wellbutrin. i had a panic attack. some may call it unwellbutrin
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"It made me calm. So calm, I blew off everything to do with tax filings and payments for a few years that I was on it, and acquired $80,000 USD in debt. Got back on stimulants and back on track with my life, and it took about 8 years but we just finished paying it all off. More than half of the total was penalties and interest, so that was a very expensive  lesson."
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"I have severe adhd and I started on Wellbutrin, it seems to me like it‚Äôs protocol to try it first before doing anything else across the board. I would go through a lot of anxiety and depression swings that can attach to adhd and I do believe it helped stabilize and slow down my brain overall

I did end up seeing a lot more benefit from a stimulant (in my case an Adderall IR split dose throughout the day and now Adderall XR now that the stimulant shortage is better) like less intense anxiety and less depression swings. I think a lot of it is just less shame about your own ability to keep up. 

Give the Wellbutrin an honest shot to see how it works for you. I know some people that have had a lot of success with it, can‚Äôt attest to the ADHD side of it for them. Personally it was a world of a difference staying organized and keeping my life gathered closer to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù once I did the stimulant but it‚Äôs better to exercise the options before moving to stimulant because there are other challenges with them like diet, sleep, crashes, ‚Äúemotion-lacking task completing robot feeling‚Äù that CAN (not will) happen. It‚Äôs still something to work with. I think I tried Wellbutrin for 3 months before I moved to a low dose stimulant, it takes a while with Wellbutrin to let it build up before you can conclude anything.

Good luck!"

Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"I‚Äôm currently taking Wellbutrin. 

I can‚Äôt fully recall, but I think the doc said I‚Äôm slightly combined with an emphasis on inattentive. 

I started off with the lowest prescribable dose of Wellbutrin because I had a huge recreational stimulant problem for a few years and was worried about potentially abusing stimulants again. 

I also smoke the silly cilantro more than the average person & combing that with stimulants can cause psychosis.

I‚Äôve since doubled the dose on the Wellbutrin and am currently maxed out. 

Still don‚Äôt feel like the meds are helping me overcome some of the more debilitating ADHD symptoms like mind wandering, motivation, and burn out but, the depression and daily suicidal ideations seem to have completely disappeared‚Ä¶for now.

If this Wellbutrin doesn‚Äôt work, my next step according to the doctor is Concerta. 

I‚Äôve also managed to drastically lowered my silly cilantro use from where it was, but it is still considered much more than what a newer user may consume. 

Because of this, my doctor is more confident that I can safely use both the Concerta & Silly Cilantro, with a minimal risk of psychosis."

Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,i have really bad inattentive adhd so i can‚Äôt speak on the behalf of activity but wellbutrin did mildly help my memory my concentration the ability to retain information and broke me out of my 2 year depressive episode
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"I take Wellbutrin, but it had been for a different reason.  When they decided to change meds, since it wasn‚Äôt helping that problem, I asked them not to.  I told my doc it was the first time in my life I could do work longer than 10 minutes without getting distracted and sidetracked.  It was a miracle drug.  I‚Äôm still on Wellbutrin, after being tested for ADHD, although I think some other stimulant would help more, but with family heart issues she said it wasn‚Äôt safe.  I was in my 50s when I was finally diagnosed.  Let‚Äôs just say my work life hasn‚Äôt been much of a success and I now realize why every thing took twice as long to do compared to my coworkers."

Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"My experience was similar to others here - Wellbutrin was very helpful but not enough. Also taking adderal was the chef‚Äôs kiss. However, I developed tinnitus (ringing of the ears) which is a side effect in as many as 6% of people. I was told to stop taking it, which is sad because it was really working for me. The tinnitus? It‚Äôs a gift for life, and I don‚Äôt even know for sure that the wellbutrin caused it."
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"I have ADHD but am relatively high functioning; I had a feeling of euphoria when I first went on Welbutrin but that quickly faded I only had a marginal improvement with my executive disfunction. 

I also have anxiety and it did help with that, so now I‚Äôm taking both Welbutrin and stimulants.

I think it‚Äôs still worth trying because it‚Äôs a much more gentle drug than Adderall‚Ä¶ everyone‚Äôs body is different and it is going to be a journey to find what works for you, so strap yourself in and don‚Äôt get discouraged if it takes some (doctor supervised) experimentation with different medications before you find what works for you."
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"Me, don‚Äôt help focus directly but it absolutely helped with my emotional regulation and silenced the constant conversations in my head which lead to less distraction. Better than 20mg adderall XR for me.

Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"I probably dont have severe ADHD, mine is more of just inattentive. But I‚Äôll just say that my doctor does not want to try stimulants with me bc I have a history of seizures (10 years ago I had 3 within 6 months, that‚Äôs all.) So we‚Äôve tried about 4 non-stimulant meds, one of which was Wellbutrin. And it did absolutely nothing to help me in any way. In fact none of the meds have helped my ADHD, but Strattera has alleviated my depression symptoms a touch. And I‚Äôm talking like it‚Äôs helped me 1 inch within a mile. Thats just me though!"
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"I was given the classic 'anxiety/depression' dx as a teen and started looking into getting treated for adhd as an adult. Psych put me on wellbutrin, sounded like a perfect fit. 
First week I physically felt like shit, second week I had crazy mood swings on top of that. I had a screaming fit at work over somerhing trivial, started fantasizing about running away from home and disappearing, almost ran my car into a guard rail on impulse... Extremely out of character for me and scared my spouse half to death. I gave it one more week to see if it would settle, but I finally had to call my doc and say I had to stop taking it because I was a danger to myself and others. Immediately felt better once I stopped taking it, never thought I'd be so happy to be back at my baseline... I sincerely hope that it works for you, but prepare yourself and people in your life in case the opposite happens!"
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,Wellbutrin on its own did not work for me but it combined with Adderall has worked wonderfully for me
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"I took Wellbutrin for almost a decade, along with Escitalopram (Lexapro/Cipralex), though this was well prior to my diagnosis of ADHD. The Wellbutrin/Cipralex combo helped enough with my moods to keep me functional, though often just barely. They never even made a dent in my executive functioning though. 

Under the advice and supervision of a new psychiatrist a couple of years ago, I stopped Wellbutrin and tried a few different stimulants (Vyvanse, Concerta, and one other I can‚Äôt remember). I felt no different after stopping the Wellbutrin, which I think says a lot. I‚Äôm still in the process of getting off the Cipralex, but it‚Äôs proving MUCH harder. I‚Äôm learning the lesson that many others trying to wean themselves off antidepressants have learned. 

All of the stimulants I tried either had no effect at all or gave me palpitations. My plan moving forward is to get myself off Cipralex so that I have a baseline for my brain again for the first time in many years. Then I want to try some other stimulants (and possibly retry some of the ones I‚Äôve already taken) if my psych agrees it‚Äôs a good idea."
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"Wellbutrin seems to work well for some folks. In my experience, the side effects were non-existent. In the same vein, it really didn't do anything to help my inattentiveness. However, it helped me start tasks more often. From my understanding, not a lot of people deal with harsh side effects, making it a solid one to try before stimulants.

The one I would hold off on until all else fails would be strattera. While this is just my experience, my time on it was absolute hell. After two months, I decided even if it would end up helping it just wasn't worth it for the side effects, especially through work. Besides, it made me so numb that my aversion to danger was non-existent.

My only issues with stimulants has more to do with the pharmacies than the actual med itself (i.e., switching generic manufacturer on me without telling me, being hit or miss about using rx codes, having a manufacturer stop production and not letting me know even after asking about the state of my prescription, and so on)."
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,Wellbutrin caused for me to have seizures just as an fyi because my doctor never told me that side effect and once I was in the ER I found out about it
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"Yes Wellbutrin is the only thing that helped. I was first diagnosed as bipolar and put on every mood stabilizer under the sun. Then I found a new doc and got reassessed and diagnosed as having the trifecta‚ÄîADHD, anxiety, depression along with some CPTSD. 

I was a heavy smoker and struggled to quit for years. Wellbutrin actually helps with smoking cessation and anxiety. Paired with a stimulant and it seems to be the right combo for me. Granted I still have to make lots of changes. I still have a caffeine and sugar addiction, don‚Äôt exercise enough outside of my job, and get sucked into tv and other things. But I‚Äôm a far and away success story compared to before Wellbutrin and vyvanse."
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"My testing didn't indicate a level of severity. But if what I've seen and read about other people's cases tells me anything, I have moderate to severe.

Wellbutrin does help. I'm on 300mg. Specifically, that dosage has helped me with emotional disregulation, which is one of my biggest symptoms. It also has helped me pull away from intrusive and distracting thoughts. I'm able to pull focus more easily than before."
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"Wellbutrin helped with my depression and compulsive eating. It didn‚Äôt do much for my inattentiveness. It interestingly reduced hyper focus though. Taking it with a stimulant was a game changing combo. 

Unfortunately, I had to go off bc I developed tremors. I‚Äôd been on it for a couple of years. When the tremors came they decided to take me off of it and they went away. It‚Äôs very rare that this happens. I miss having it as it did help in certain areas."
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"I have severe ADHD with autism. I had extremely bad luck with Wellbutrin...

It nearly killed me! I got a pulmonary edema that started on my left lung before it spread to both, and severe heart palpitations.
At first I thought I got a bronchitis, as I started to cough a lot, (it started with the same cough you get when you have bronchitis, the doctor then thought it was pneumonia, as the lungs filling up with fluid sounds the same), later on I also got severe pain in my heart when coughing and random palpitations...

We connected these symptoms to Wellbutrin when they got severely worse immediately after my dose was upped, as the dose I took only helped a little for my severe ADHD. 

After visiting my doctor and him calling my psychiatrist, I halted the use of it, the symptoms drastically lessened in the first few days, and were gone within a fortnight. Since then I still cough a lot more than I did before and have regular pains in my left lung area.

Not telling you not to try it, (I really hope it works for you) but monitor your body, (as we all should do when taking medication) and don't be afraid to talk about possible side effects with your doctor and psychiatrist."
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,I ABSOLUTELY LOVED WELLBUTRIN! IT WAS PERFECT FOR ME EXCEPT it made me nauseous every minute of the day for the entire year I took.

I wouldn't go as far as saying it's a bad idea to try it, but I've seen far too many Dr's who prescribe it as a way to avoid EVER prescribing stimulants. The Dr may be wanting to try wellbutrin because it is easier to prescribe, easier to fill, and less of an issue to have. Or they may be a coward."

Adderall brought me into functioning human territory."
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"It's not the ""instant gratification"" that adderall was. It takes 4 to 6 weeks to be fully effective, but for me, it's much better. Treats the symptoms as well as or better than adderall with almost none of the side effects. What side effects it does have are far less concerning than those of adderall. For example, occasional headaches vs. insomnia and heart racing and anxiety.

Word of caution, though, if you have bipolar depressive disorder, I wouldn't recommend it. It can make the mania more.. manic. Psychosis is technically a possibility depending on the person and other factors, and it lowers your threshold for having a seizure, so little to no alcohol."
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"Yes!! I was diagnosed (at 26) because I went to a new doctor for the first time for a UTI of all things, and he was concerned by my answers to the routine mental health questionnaire, which I wasn‚Äôt even expecting them to read lol. 

A little bit of discussion about what was going on and I ended up being like, ‚Äúwelll, you know, I suppose you could prescribe Wellbutrin. I tried a TON of med combos in the past and none worked until Wellbutrin. It was the magic key.‚Äù And this doctor goes, ‚ÄúI have a theory as to why that is. Let‚Äôs schedule you an ADHD evaluation.‚Äù LMAO 

I passed with flying colors in the worst way. Something like 64/70‚Ä¶ and a 40 qualified as severe ADHD by whichever standard they used. I saw much later that he noted hyperactivity in my chart on that first visit too lol. I‚Äôm now on adderall and Wellbutrin and life is soooo much better. It‚Äôs so effective that coworkers can tell which days I have or haven‚Äôt taken my meds.

Edit to add: after reading other comments I want to concur with everything said about Wellbutrin alone, but also that guanfacine, which I also take, is SUPER helpful (for me) for the emotional dysregulation. It‚Äôs not a stimulant."

Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,I had good experience with Wellbutrin. I had to up dose after three months to find good fit but definitely helped.

Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"I have pretty significant ADHD, it's hard for me to compare it to others, but, for instance, when I'm unmedicated i sit at my desk all day scrolling my phone completely unable to work and i get into trouble for it and still can't stop or change my behavior it just feels so fucking impossible and it's a pretty significant problem. Wellbutrin has helped me greatly, when I take it regularly (which I often fail to do of course) I'm better able to choose what I focus my attention on, it makes a huge difference, it feels like the friction is gone and I can just do things, the things I actually want to be doing, it feels like magic. 

I tried stimulants first and I HATE them, they make my brain itch (that's the best way I can describe it, it's a very weird sensation, almost like tingling but not and almost painful but also not), I feel gods awful on stimulants and the crash makes me completely nonfunctional in a bad way. Stimulants make me angry, irritable, unable to control these horrible angry irritated outbursts, and I get horrible withdrawal headaches, it's a mess, it's a nightmare. 

But somehow wellbutrin is the magic med for me, I don't get it, it's weird but that's just how my body is I guess. But also, I guess I should note, in addition to ADHD I also have depression and Autism so maybe it's just my own weird brain combo thingy"

Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"I was diagnosed a year ago. I went to the doctor and told him that I don‚Äôt want stimulans medication because I don‚Äôt want to take ‚Äúspeed‚Äù. He advised to try Wellbutrin.

I have combined type. My condition is not what I would call severe, but more like 5 or 6 out of 10. We started with 150 mg. It takes up to 2 weeks for Wellbutrin to take full effect, but I felt the first effects after 4-5 days.

Motivation and memory improved drastically. A lot less hyperactivity. Anxiety is gone. Time blindness disappeared. I could remeber things better and here‚Äôs something totally new to me: I could remember if I DID NOT do something! Not after the fact, like we usually forget things. I could remember not doing a thing at the appropriate moment, before it was too late. Don‚Äôt know if this makes sense, but that happened first time after starting Wellbutrin.

On the flip side, my sleep schedule changed. I stay awake till 2-3 am, before I would get to bed 11 pm or so. I don‚Äôt feel sleepy anymore. Like at all. When it gets too late, I just go to bed. I fall asleep alright, I just lost that feeling of sleepiness.

My dreams also changed. Not like nightmares. These are normal dreams alright, but somehow their ‚Äúflavour‚Äù changed. Don‚Äôt know how else to put it. After a couple of months, I got used to it, but that was a weird experience.

My apetite increased. I never had issues with food, but I gained 13 kilos in the past 12 months.

Anxiety is gone alright, but it feels to me that that sense of urgency made me complete tasks. Now that the sense of urgency is gone I feel like I am getting less done than before. That might not be completely true, because it‚Äôs based on a feeling rather than actively tracking my performance and results. It could be that previously I was tracking my progress by the intensity of anxiety that was present. Which might not be the most reliable way. Or a way at all to track your progress x)

Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"I first went to the doctor for issues with depression at 21. Tried a few drugs over the course of a few years and landed on Wellbutrin. 

Can't say it made a huge difference for my symptoms, but it took the edge off and unlike the other drugs it felt like it was at least doing *something*.

Fast forward 16 years and I was still having issues with depression and my very wise new shrink immediately made the connection between all of my symptoms and realized it was ADHD. 

Started me on Vyvanse in addition to Wellbutrin and it was life-changing. Just such a major shift. Brain fog cleared and I had energy for the first time in years. Could actually do things. 

It's been a few years now and we actually just tapered me off the Wellbutrin for curiosity more than anything else. I've been on it for so long and it's possible I don't even need it and that I might be experiencing side effects I don't even realize.

It‚Äôs uncommon to start someone on a non-stimulant unless you have dangerous preexisting conditions (like heart problems) or have a history of substance abuse. Sometimes if you have anxiety they‚Äôll want to treat that first. But if none of those apply, you might want to find a different doctor. Even if they eventually prescribe stimulants, they sound pretty conservative and might be difficult to work with. My psych NP was very flexible when I had a hard time finding what stimulant worked for me, and I‚Äôm

Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"Wellbutrin has helped me sleep better.  My thoughts don't run quite as much.  But it's a very mild improvement.  Like taking aspirin for a toothache.  Definitely some improvement, but the problem is still there."

I started the stimulant first and it helped *some*, but it wasn‚Äôt until I added Wellbutrin (I titrated up to 300 mg XL) that I really started being able to like, *do things.* 

One of the issues I had before was I somehow was never able to accomplish anything but at the same time I could never wind down or relax. Now I am able to do both. But I can‚Äôt speak on Wellbutrin alone."
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"I have actually been taking Wellbutrin for 4-5 years now, before I found out I had severe ADHD.

I started with Wellbutrin alone while waiting for a formal assessment and diagnosis.  My family doctor wasn't comfortable prescribing a stimulant without a formal diagnosis and pre-treatment testing (blood work and ECG), but recognized that I needed some form of treatment in the meantime.

It was absolutely better than nothing while we got the rest sorted out.  We initially tapered off of the Wellbutrin and then added the stimulant (Concerta), but decided to add the Wellbutrin back to fill in some gaps that the Concerta left."

Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"Wellbutrin was what worked for me (only because the usual SSRIs I tried made me numb in parts of myself). The initial formulation was too activating (I couldn't sleep)--I believe it was XL. Then I switched to same dose, but the sustained release formulation and that was better. The inattentiveness is still there for me. I was diagnosed after age 40, and first time I tried adderall, it kept me awake but I was very ""attuned""--- it was the first time I could pay attention to a show without needing to have subtitles on. It felt like I put glasses on for the first time and my brain ""can see."" But over time, I think the adderall gave me horrible crashes. I still take bupropion because it is keeping me leveled for my depression comorbidity.

  
One thing to note with bupropion, if you have a history of seizures, it may be contraindicated or you'll have to be followed by your doctor closely.  I have hypertension and adderall is contraindicated, so I had to adjust to a lower dose and optimize my hypertension medications."
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"Wellbutrin gives my brain a very good baseline, like it tells the adhd ducks where to line up.

Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"My adhd is like moderate to severe and I feel like Wellbutrin has helped somewhat. I was on methylfenidate (however you pronounce that) and Vyvanse before but both made me feel very strange and numb. Wellbutrin helps me with focusing on one task at a time and motivation once I‚Äôve already started, but it still takes me longer than is normal to complete tasks bc of zoning out. I‚Äôm also still very fidgety. But there‚Äôs a clear difference between me off Wellbutrin and me on it"
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"I'd say I'm severe, but present differently than you. I'm a hyperfocus kinda guy. I'm either all-in on one thing or nothing exists but distractions. Personally, I've ONLY had luck with Wellbutrin. Literally everything else I've tried, from stimulants to SSRIs, has given me intense anxiety attacks. Not suggesting you don't try other options, because everyone is different. But I am saying that Wellbutrin (and only Wellbutrin, medicinally speaking) has made a significant impact for the better on my life.

I want to reiterate though. Don't take my word for shit. Listen to your doctor and make sure they listen to you. Everyone is different, and it can take time to find the right treatment."
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"NO, Wellbutrin did not help my ADHD at all, and it gave me weird scary dreams.  Ritalin helped my ADHD, including the depression, anxiety, grouchiness etc.  I wouldnt take Wellbutrin again if someone paid me."

Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"Wellbutrin changed my life in nursing school but once I hit my actual career it wasn‚Äôt enough. (I‚Äôm a nurse lol) Wellbutrin helped me balance if that makes sense, like really made my anxiety level during school and it gave me a bit more energy so my lows weren‚Äôt as low. I was still terrible at studying and time management but it helped enough to where I passed instead of failed. 

Once I started as an RN I realized it wasn‚Äôt enough and my coworkers all said go get evaluated for adhd lmfao. And here we are! I stopped taking Wellbutrin and am on 20 mg IR and 20 mg XR adderall. I decided to quit Wellbutrin myself because taking adderall and getting my shit together has basically treated my anxiety hahah."
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"I don't take wellbutrin for ADHD, I take it for depression, but in that regard it's my favorite antidepressant to date (and I've taken a lot) because I don't have bad side affects like I did with all the other ones.

Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"I found it helpful but not because it helped with the ADHD directly. It made it easier to get through the day and be more emotionally resilient when dealing with the fallout of having ADHD. Less emotional dysregulation, less depression, less burnout. So I still struggled with things, but I wasn't miserable about it anymore lol. And because of that I was about to deal with the struggle better than otherwise."

Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"It was a magic pill for me. I took it for depression, not knowing it helps executive function. Time slowed down. I would do things I needed to do without even debating it in my head. And then it would only be an hour later, or whatever. Time slowed down. Instead of my constant rushing and getting nowhere, I had more than enough time. And I was focused. I felt like an eagle for some reason. I was motivated and effective, confident, powerful. 

Unfortunately, it gave me dyspnea/shortness of breath, an uncommon side effect. I never made the connection until I tried it again recently and was constantly gasping for air and had an ache in my chest when I tried to take a deep breath. I researched it and discovered other people had the same symptoms and it is listed as a possible side effect. Then I realized all the mysterious breathing issues I'd had years ago must have been from the Wellbutrin. 

It breaks my heart because it's really the only med that makes me functional, much more so than even Ritalin."
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,I tried Wellbutrin and it gave me splitting headaches :(
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"It kind of worked for a while. I never tried any medication before. It was more related to the fact that I was more positive and kind to myself rather than being focused or productive. It helped me with having a bit of ‚Äúquiet‚Äù in my brain which I had never felt before and because of this I wasn‚Äôt as upset with myself and the world. 

I remember the first time I noticed it. I was riding the bike and all of a sudden I realised there was silence in my head. I compare it to entering a room where the tv is on, radio is on, kids are playing with noisy toys, someone has a water fountain on and people are talking. All of a sudden you turn everything off and just breath, the relief was out of this world. I will remember those minutes forever as it was the first time I had no doubt that my struggle was real and I deserved to be helped.
I suffer a lot with impostor syndrome as the people around me have very strong opinions against ADHD. 

Unfortunately about a year later it slowly started not working as good and my gp suggested me to stop it (she also thinks adhd is a fairytale and that adults should just walk more eat better buy an agenda and get their shit together) so I did stop for a few months. 
Then my adhd was getting so bad I had to get help from a psychiatrist and when I tried bupropion again it just didn‚Äôt do anything at all. 
I then changed to rubifen which gave me serious jitter spikes and then concerta which did absolutely nothing and now im on elvanse (vyvanse?) I started the last one on 30mg and it was a bit short and then moved to 50mg which seems to be ok 80% of the time but the other 20% it feels like its too high or too low.

Im not trying other medications as this one works okeyishhh and as a new self-employed I cant afford spending a year finding something that works perfectly right now, but Ill probably try something else in the future."

I graduated college, have held a job for 9 years, got married and am about to have baby number two this summer. I know Wellbutrin isn‚Äôt for everyone, but my mom also thrives on it.

Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"Wellbutrin is one of those drugs you can use to fine-tune an established treatment regimen.

Wellbutrin is an NDRI like methylphenidate, but Wellbutrin acts on different parts of the brain.

You should not be starting on Wellbutrin. I guess see if anything happens with it, it won't hurt. Knowing how you respond to it can provide clues as to what your brain needs.

You should really be starting on Strattera if they're trying to take the non-stimulant route. Strattera has some pretty weird side-effects like unprovoked ejaculations (rare) and if my dose is too high I literally start pissing semen... From my bladder. It back-flows up my urethra and exits into my bladder.

But damn if it isn't a cornerstone in my ADHD treatment.

I take Wellbutrin and Strattera together alongside methylphenidate and caffeine, and take Zoloft to take the edge off.

Needless to say, my ADHD is more than debilitating."

It‚Äôs been almost a year now on it, and while the effects seem milder than stimulant medication, they definitely seem to complement each other and work well as a combo. I aim to stop the Wellbutrin in the next couple of months.

It‚Äôs definitely helped manage symptoms like emotional dysregulation, but I would still be drowning if i didn‚Äôt also have IR/XR Adderall combo. The few days I have missed my adderall, I‚Äôve noticed a drop off in productivity and mood. On the few days I‚Äôve missed Wellbutrin, my emotional regulation is down and my irritability is way up. 

Other than that first day, it took at least a couple of weeks for the effects to kick in. If you don‚Äôt have that kind of time, maybe it‚Äôs not for you.

For some people it's a miracle. I've been off and on it throughout the years for ADHD/depression/anxiety. For me it's hard to feel the effects but when I've been on it I have anxiety still but it helps with depression and motivation generally.

That being said, I‚Äôm on day three of Strattera (still a low dose) and while it‚Äôs too soon to say, my hope is it goes better. I would like a lower stim dosage, and so any help I can get is great.

ultimately it was worth it because i was highly delusional and suicidal *and* experiencing heart problems before i got on those medications. for me, because my comorbid disorders were so bad, i had to spend two years adjusting dosages until i was mentally stable. severe depression and anxiety can cause some ADHD-like symptoms, so i think my psych CNP was making sure that 1) the most prominent dangers to my health were resolved and 2) i still had symptoms of ADHD present without symptoms of depression and anxiety. she did try me out on a handful of non-stimulant options *before* she referred me to ADHD testing, which could easily be because i had had problems with my heart before. but none of those worked out for me and unfortunately my ADHD symptoms *overall* had gotten worse because my methods of managing them up to that point in my life were no longer viable.  
  
so, in short wellbutrin personally helped me but not for my ADHD. the only thing that has been successful for my ADHD has been a combination of concerts and ritalin. it is by no means perfect or eliminates my symptoms (especially since i'm wary of upping my dosages beyond what they currently are because of both the risk to my heart and because of how expensive the medications are) and i'm currently working out how to handle my disorder with less severe symptoms and not being able to rely on anxiety, but it's so much better, *life* is so much better now."
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,Is getting off Wellbutrin difficult? Is the dose for weight loss really higher than for their?
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"Yes it worked for me, it‚Äôs an antidepressant so it helped a little without the stimulant side effects, and with weight loss and with quitting vaping. But I had to stop taking it cause it gave me ringing in my ears. If you‚Äôre going to do that and have severe adhd like me and don‚Äôt want to be on a normal stimulant cause you don‚Äôt like the side effects I‚Äôd suggest taking that and then when you really need a push take some adderall on top of it at a low mg dose that‚Äôs what I was doing."
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"I take welbutrin for my depression/anxiety and it honestly does nothing for my ADHD. But it's also not surprising because I also take amitriptyline for migraines and it does nothing for my anxiety. I currently am not taking anything for my ADHD right now because I'm already on so many other medications for other health issues, it's not a great idea to put me on a stimulant since everything could react to each other."
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,I was on welbutrin years before I got diagnosed with ADHD and because it did well with it already was something that clued my psychiatrist in since folks with ADHD typically do well with welbutrin.
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"Moderate intermittent use of Adderall for me, (due to attenuation), 20 mg, BID, per script, but usually 10 -20 mg once a day and potentially another 10 mg later, and recently added Buproprion, 150mg, BID for the last 3 months, in attempts to improve upon exacerbated major depressive disorder as well as newer symptoms of adhedonia, and hypersomnia,(I tried quite a bit of antidepressants and they actually would override the Adderall and I thought I was turning into Rip Van Winkle, the hypersomnia and sluggish cognition along with it was extremely debilitating).

Long story short, the Buproprion did absolutely nothing for me, and the Doc doesn't want to go up because of the Adderall.  Unfortunately got a new doc and Adderall is the boogie man and what junkies do etc. but because I've been with the same script and the practice for over a decade I was ""grandfathered in,"" with an extreme watchful eye.

For me, the thing that was helped me the most is Modafonil and it's derivatives.  I attenuate to that as well but not as quick as Adderall, and for me, the improvement of sluggishness and being actually somewhat alert, psychological helps with my depressive symptoms because I actually feel more of a fair shot at things if I can be awake and participatory lol.

To a lesser extent, I've had some success with Tesofensine, (more of a seratonergic type response), and micro dosing psylliocibum when any anxiety is acting up).

I'll soon be trialing: Bromantane and NAC, 9me-bc, DMAA, Cortexin and Cerebrolysin. Because I attenuate often to seemingly everything and my ADHD is quite severe and the new depression symptoms have been wrecking my life, I'm pretty much throwing paint at the wall in a semi intelligent manner, and seeing what sticks."

Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"I did not get diagnosed with ADHD until I was 27. I am 31 now. When I first started this journey, I was just taking Adderall. Eventually, we boosted the dosage of that. And then eventually like maybe about a year or so later we added Wellbutrin on as a supplement. At first, it was great. It Really was great for me and a good addition to the Adderall. However, I have lost so much weight as a result of these two medication‚Äôs. When I started, I was almost 300 pounds. This was late 2017. Now I am 130 pounds. Last year I had to, have my doctor taper me off of the Wellbutrin. My doctor initially told me when we were discussing adding this medication to my regime, that it is also apparently prescribed to people as a weight loss supplement as it curves appetite. Which totally makes sense. But yeah, people always ask me how I have lost about 150 or so pounds, and I just, give Wellbutrin all of the credit lol"
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"I‚Äôm on that and Prozac. All I can say is that it‚Äôs kept me waaaaay more emotionally balanced.

I really want to try Wellbutrin but my doc days the meds I‚Äôm on work so well he doesn‚Äôt want to mess w it. So hopefully they are great for you because that in my opinion would be awesome and then you wouldn‚Äôt have to deal w the stuff that comes along w having stimulants rx‚Äôd.

Anyway, not to discourage from the medicine, my cousin who took it seemed to not have a problem with it but said he didn‚Äôt see much change. Conversely, a really close friend says it saved his life lol."
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"My doctor tried just wellbutrin at first, and it sorta helped a bit. At first, it felt like a sort of 'catch-all', I was having severe depression and anxiety issues despite the fact that I was there first and foremost for ADHD. I know it also helps with concentration too.

It definitely helps, I still take it, but I consider it to be my antidepressant more than anything else. My doctor slowly upped my dosage, and I was still struggling with ADHD while the depression and anxiety were starting to become manageable. Even when I got the anxiety under control, ADHD was still looming over me daily. My doctor introduced Straterra in a very small dosage, and we slowly increased it over the course of six months.

My Adhd is like 75% manageable now. I still forget a lot of things and get can get distracted by things. Practicing mindfulness helps sometimes.

What I like is that the only side effects I get from this combination is when I miss a dosage for two days and my adhd comes roaring back. If I miss one day of wellbutrin, I can tell later in the day. I just get so hopeless and pessimistic out of nowhere.


I'll add my dosage for context.

Straterra: 60mg
Wellbutrin: 300mg"
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"Im on stimulant, Guanfacine, and wellbutrin.  I have been on wellbutrin for two weeks now.  I stopped my stimulant to see if the wellbutrin is working. Its hard to tell. I am more socialble, tasks are a little easier, theres some focus.  I am going to start my stimulant back up next week and see how all three work. However, at this moment in time . It is hard to tell for me because I am only 2 weeks on wellbutrin.  I am getting insomnia. Even woke up at 4 am today. Usually when I take stimulants. I sleep like a charm."

Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,I‚Äôm on both it and Vyvanse. The Wellbutrin is more for my depression than adhd however the two work well together to help me with both.
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,Wellbutrin helped me with emotional regulation and depression. The big difference in the ADHD st.ptoms came when I got Vyvanse added to it.
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"I took Wellburtin before starting stimulants took it for give or take about 3 - 4 months. This was to try before jumping to a stimulant. 

So like you my doctor wanted to try this first. Im going to be bluntly honest it did not do shit for me besides make me more angry. I already struggled regulating my emotions anger being one of my more intense ones. It really felt like it made me angry all the time, more so than I usually would get. 

The smallest of things would send me to 100 in seconds. To top it off thinking back, even given what I was going through I think it made me suicidal. I knew it wasn‚Äôt like me, telling my doctor she told me that some people feel this way. 

Everyone is different but this was my experience I took 150mg Wellbutrin daily, in the morning before work. Not only did it make me rage constantly, it did not a thing for my ADHD symptoms. Doctor told me it would help with concentration/focus, motivation, energy and other things. But it didn‚Äôt do anything but make me miserable. 

After talking to my doctor, she took me off Wellbutrin and she started me on methylphenidate ( concerta ) 27mg. Im so glad that I started on it, I saw improvement within a few weeks, although the dose was increased to 36mg. 

I do wonder if Wellbutrin would do better paired with what Im taking. ( concerta ) but Im afraid to find out. Seeing a-lot of people on here saying that they take both. I think I will eventually be switching to a different medication, but only time will tell. 

I hope Wellbutrin works for you, wish you all the luck!

My meds are : Concerta 36mg, Prozac 60mg ( fluoxetine ) and 10mg of hydroxyzine ( take 3 times daily as needed )"
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"Wellbutrin made me feel absolutely insane. I almost felt like I was tweaked out. I completely lost my mind and starting behaving very erratically. I was threatening people for no apparent reason. Had zero impulse control. Like genuine violent threats that completely ruined a relationship I had. I‚Äôm not a violent person at all. As soon as I realized WTF was happening I flushed the rest of it. 

Brain chemistry is crazy man. If you start feeling weird or behaving uncharacteristically on it, call your doctor immediately."
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"I wouldn‚Äôt say I have severe ADHD, but Wellbutrin didn‚Äôt do much of anything for my inattentiveness.

Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"Yes best combo for me. Wellbutrin + Vyvanse and for me, it‚Äôs the perfect combo. I actually notice when I don‚Äôt take one or the other.

Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"My daughter was on concerta growing up and is 19 and started taking Wellbutrin and was skeptical. So far it‚Äôs been working really well, it‚Äôs only 30 days but I can see the difference. However when I took it, it caused severe depression, so I couldn‚Äôt continue even though I thought it worked really well on the ADHD front."
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"One thing about Wellbutrin that catches people off guard to be aware of is the sudden rise in Suicidal thoughts the first couple weeks. They do not know why it happens but with Wellbutrin specifically, you could have never experienced those thoughts but get them on this medication. They can start after the first week and last 7-10 days so just be prepared."
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"I went on it for about 6 weeks.

For me it just made me flat. I had less concentration issues, so work productivity increased, but less drive to do anything in my free time.

Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"I'm on Welbutrin and Strattera. I started with just the welbutrin, and it had a temporary focus effect for the first couple of days that I didn't feel was strong enough after adjusting. Otherwise, my mood did improve. Started with 100mgs and now on 150mgs. 

Once I brought up the welbutrin was meh for focus, we began Strattera at 25mgs. I've been on it since, and it's a good combination for me. My provider is very strategic and cautious because I told her I may have a high sensitivity to medication. 

Any drugs or alcohol usually affects me stronger, including pain medication than my peers. So, it was safer to mention I may be sensitive."
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"Factually speaking, Wellbutrin boosts the same chemicals in the brain that ADHD stimulants do, so logically I don‚Äôt see why it wouldn‚Äôt work in place of them for *some* people. That said, meds are weird and don‚Äôt always play out like that. For example IR stimulants puzzlingly last longer for me than LA ones of the same type, so your mileage may vary with any medication, even with similar mechanisms of action. Based on the science it‚Äôs worth a shot though."

Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"Would you guys mind sharing dosages too? I tried 150mg XL generic wellbutrin for a month and it didn't seem to do anything at all. I told the doctor that i THINK it was helping to keep me from getting moody, but that I wasn't sure because it was only a month. I went manic shortly after it ran out. Not sure if that's a coincidence or if it was really helping me stay stable. Otherwise it didn't do anything."
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"Can‚Äôt speak for you or your doctor but I think (personally) it‚Äôs ridiculous to waste time with meds that aren‚Äôt stimulants from the get go when you have severe ADHD. I also have severe ADHD, and I was diagnosed as a kid. My mom was diagnosed later in life. I‚Äôm on 45mg adderall (currently pregnant too) and she‚Äôs on 60mg adderall. I have messed around with many other meds through my childhood/teen years/college/early career, and frankly wasted a lot of time on other stuff that didn‚Äôt work for me (examples: Vyvanse didn‚Äôt do SHIT for me, was on 70mg‚Ä¶ I tried Ritalin, Concerta, and all types of breakdowns of Adderall IR/XR). I have siblings on those meds but their ADHD is definitely manageable compared to me and my mom. It‚Äôs such a disappointment to have your first day prescribed something new and you KNOW it doesn‚Äôt work and you have to wait a month to switch. My point is, if you can bear to, be assertive about WHAT you want the meds to accomplish and how you‚Äôre measuring that accomplishment.

PS - I hear you on the reading thing. I‚Äôve struggled to read my whole life and it‚Äôs embarrassing as fuck. Take your time and use a marker to underline points that stuck out to you so you can track what you absorbed.

Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"Probably an unpopular opinion of mine, but what classifies as severe? I think having ADHD itself is pretty distrupting (well imo) but because everyone has their own view on what severe is, what is it exactly? Its because you emphisised it so I was like oh is my adhd severe? But for me the book thing, i loved reading but tbh i think its because of praise because id still have to reread sentances like no tomorrow and still struggled to remember what happened aha.

Ive not been on wellbrutin myself but after googling Bupropion popped up which apparently is used to stop smoking? Is there something that makes you unable to start stimulant medication? My bp was high and my hr but because my 12hr ecg came back with just sinus tachy they started me on stimulants. Currently they are trying elvanse with guafacine to treat the high bp and to see if it helps elvanse be more effective. A medication isnt a one stop wonder sadly, it might be wellbrutin isnt for you or it might be :) we wont 100% know because everyones bodies are different ^^ i wish you all the best!

Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"I've been out of meds for quite some time but was taking Adderall and Wellbutrin together. Wellbutrin isn't a replacement for Adderall or another stimulant, it's an antidepressant. Depression is often present alongside ADHD (a comorbidity) and depression can amplify the negative aspects of ADHD. Doctors will sometimes try to treat the depression first because the ADHD symptoms may be reduced and more manageable if the depression is more controlled, thereby allowing for a lower dosage of stimulant medication or if you're lucky not needing it at all.  For me the Wellbutrin didn't seem to help at all and while the Adderall does help its side effects (like making me really tired) led me to only want to take it on days I really needed the help badly."

As for wellbutrin or bupropion in general - I feel like it also boosts the effectiveness of stimulants. Methylphenidate without it doesn't do shit for me at all."
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"Same.

Wellbutrin helps a little with my needs met by Adderall / Vyvanse, but it‚Äôs stimulant properties IMO are similar to drinking a strong cup of coffee.

I feel it helps me manage my mood and mental clarity. 

But amphetamines allow me to truly focus and be productive."
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"I am on the same combo.  I take the SR in the morning with my stimulant and another smaller one at night.  Evens out the mood swings and puts me in a happier overall state of mind.

My (Non psych) doctor started me on Wellbutrin first as well.  What they don't tell you is that in order for it to be used to treat adhd for real it STARTS at 400mg per day.  They will never start you on that dose and I doubt they would be willing to go that high if they are not a psych.  Not sure if you have a psych but getting one from the start will save you lots of effort most likely."
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,Same. Wellbutrin does more for my depression than the adhd symptoms.
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,Yes. I got put on Wellbutrin first and it changed my life. The emotional side of inattentive ADHD can be so debilitating. Now I‚Äôm on Adderall and Wellbutrin and it‚Äôs good. Best to do one med change at a time though and the Wellbutrin isn‚Äôt for everyone but it does wonders for some of us. I literally think I‚Äôd be dead without it.
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"Same. Wellbutrin was diagnosed to help with persistent depressive disorder. I was on 300 mg XL. I said I thought I had ADHD and was told to be assessed. After being diagnosed with ADHD, I was first on Adderall, because Vyvanse was not covered by my insurance at the time. Adderall just made me feel like having the energy to do things, but didn‚Äôt seem to do anything else. 

I‚Äôve been on Vyvanse XR for a little over a year and take 40 mg. I still take the same dose of Wellbutrin, and it seems I need both. One time I had to wait a few days for Wellbutrin to be restocked at the pharmacy. I definitely noticed without that, I was more irritable about small things that annoyed me, and that would be associated with emotional reactivity and making associated statements. With Wellbutrin, I still recognize what annoys me, but I just notice it and go on with my day. Vyvanse for me is like having the energy to do what I need to do and to be able to prioritize it and mindfully choose to take action or not take action with non-preferred tasks. Vyvanse definitely has been helpful in that way, but I still need to choose my actions, and if I choose to do something I enjoy, I am really be able to focus on that as well. I hope this information helps."
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"Wellbutrin and Strattera was the winner for me (and yes, I'm aware of the risks of taking both together--I have weird genetics apparently and it seems to work for me. Definitely not a common/recommended combo)."

Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"I was SUCH an angry person a few years ago. Snapped at every little thing all the time. Got put on Wellbutrin and Adderall and within 6 months my mood swings and anger outbursts had nearly disappeared. I now can stop myself and regulate/manage my emotions in real-time for most things. I 100% thank Wellbutrin for that. I watched it do the same thing to my dad, so there's 2/2 on helping moodswings."
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,Same
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"Agreed! I love Wellbutrin, it's the first medication that's helped with my anxiety, but in no way could it replace Adderall"

Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,Same! I‚Äôm not severe but just getting started after 50+ years without any treatment with Wellbutrin and Ritalin. They‚Äôre about to up my Rit dose but it‚Äôs been helping
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"Same‚Ä¶they compliment each other well, is what one doctor told me."
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"Wellbutrim is really bad for me.

In a complete lack of all meds is better than nothing, but it gets me in a low mood (ironically for a antidepressant, I don't have depression maybe that is it). I feel more like a zombie with it. 

For me the best medication I took was Ritalin, I took Concerta too but it was not so good."
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"I can second this. For me, stims and wellbutrin go well together"
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,Same here. I take a stimulant as well as Wellbutrin and I find they work well together. The stimulant quiets my brain and motivates me to do task after task. The Wellbutrin helps manage my emotions and keeps me from having any sort of stimulant crash at the end of the day. Also helps with my PMDD.
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,How you deal when stimulants wearing off at nights? I‚Äôm taking Wellbutrin 300 it helps but like you it doesn‚Äôt help with my inattentiveness
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,Yeah I take Wellbutrin and vyvanes. Combo seems to work haha
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,This was my exact situation/reaction to wellbutrin.
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"I second that. I take Vyvanse in the morning, and Wellbutrin in the evening. I just started Vyvanse on 30mg, so I'm hoping the Wellbutrin keeps me from increasing my Vyvanse dosage too much in the future."
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"wellbutrin caused an extreme worsening of my panic disorder! it can be an ‚Äúactivating‚Äù med since it‚Äôs has weak stimulant effects so it makes sense, but still, ouch."
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,I also had a lot of anxiety and per my Apple Watch my heart rate was like 20bpm higher than normal resting. I only took it for 3 days before I noped out. I was bummed because I thought I would do better with it than stimulants. I just raw dog life instead tbh
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,I had this same experience. As soon as I got off of it everything got sooooo much better.
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"I am about to meet with my psychiatrist to taper off Wellbutrin because I'm having lots of panic attacks. Like at this very moment. 

But I also relate to the other person that it made them calm as I am currently blowing everything off."
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,Did you take it alongside another stimulant or take a high dose? 75-150 my the most common ive seen.

Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"Wait, how did you rack up so much??"
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"It‚Äôs not any official protocol, but doctors have discretion to make up their own. My doctor generally starts adults out on 10 mg of adderall. Just pointing that out so people are aware of their options - if you don‚Äôt like a doctors protocols around prescriptions, you can find a new one. I would just be mindful to not have these doctors prescribe you any controlled substance, unless you think you might stick with them - there is a record of every single time you have a controlled substance filled & it can be a red flag to prescribers that you receive it from so many different doctors."
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,Do you still take Wellbutrin with stimulant?
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"Thank you for your post. The more I read it seems true that it's protocol to start on just the Wellbutrin. I will be starting on 150 XL tomorrow (once I pick it up) and am so apprehensive because I have stayed away from any medications for reasons of being sensitive to side effects. 

I have ADHD and I also started hormone therapy for my perimenopause symptoms which have exasperated my lack of focus and concentration, not to mention I have twenty projects going on and can't complete any of them. I am hoping to have some focus and concentration issues helped with this, but the more I read I hope I can avoid taking stimulants with it.

 I'm also wondering if this makes you tired because it sounds like for others it makes them sleep. I take 200 mg of progesterone before bed which helps me sleep so I have to the Wellbutrin in the morning when I start. Another thing I worry about is it seems for some that they lose their appetite and for me who has suffered from not eating enough (adrenal issues) I might have to make sure I keep eating."
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,Oh I'm absolutely hoping it works. My psych brought it up as a possibility. However I'm actually the one that suggested trying it. I'm pretty open to it. Because I know it's like pretty much the starter drug for ADHD

Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,Pretty similar for me. Except I call it mystical parsley haha
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"I'm on a Concerta + Wellbutrin program. It's wonderful! I'm not anxious when I'm not overstimulated, and as long as I take the Wellbutrin, I'm not depressed. 

I've been on Wellbutrin for years. It's not enough by itself. 

I've done the concerta alone too. Significant improvement, but definitely still needed the antidepressant aspect."
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"Concerta is harder to abuse also .. you can't crush it , or shoot it up .. ( my dad (rip) got into mine when visiting and tried like hours to do this that's how I know it can't be done cuz he would have figured it.)  

Bonus about concerta is that AlOT of people don't know what it is so they won't be trying to buy it after they find out your on meds. ( I eventually stopped making new friends because everyone here is either in active addiction / or in recovery   or just crazy and I am both . I'm so freaking social and now I realize I am just too old to deal with other people's extra problems adding to my delicate balance of moods. I don't want drama or no longer want to fight Everyone which became a huge issue the last time I was off all medications . Not only had I become suicidal but also homicidal thoughts control with my every waking hr. I was just a mean girl.

Once finally admitting to myself and an ER Dr why id choose to hit my x boyfriends friend with My car I got back into a doctor office because no one wanted to treat me because of my addiction meds. Lucky me  I have to submit to random drug testing for the addiction specialist anyway so I was able to go right back  on Adderall ..I'll still end up switching back to concerta prob after 5 years cuz that's been my norm. I feel like my body gets used to whatever I'm on and simply does not work on my symptoms as it should. 

I'm glad your Dr. It is comfortable giving concerta to you after admitting  your stimulant abuse because it will help you so so much. I'm sure you already know that you will feel like a new person again..ah that moment is as good as it gets. Just feeling normal or somewhat close to it is good enough for me. Good luck

Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"Me too! Sounds similar to my issues ""10 minutes without getting distracted and sidetracked"" is very relatable, more like 5 minutes for me. And my doctor was concerned about my heart issues also.

Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"Thank you for the great information. I begin using 150 mg tomorrow so your post helps answer some questions and also helps balance the pos and negs of this med. I know what works for some may not work for others, but being that I am pretty sensitive to any medication, the low non-stimulant dose is best for me.

 I am worried about headaches because I used to suffer from migraines and would want to hit my head on the wall just for relief. I also started taking progesterone at night for perimenopause symptoms and it has been such a relief that it helps me sleep through the night. I'm hoping I don't have an issue with that either. 

And you gained weight when many others have said they lost weight which also was a worry for me because I do have an eating disorder and have to force myself to eat so I don't lose weight."
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,Oh God I know those things are NASTY. I got them from Risperdone for unrelated issue. I couldn't move my head.

Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"My understanding (slash opinion) is severe ADHD impacts every aspect of your life‚Ä¶ but like severely lol. I was diagnosed as a kid and my ADHD is considered severe because 1. I‚Äôm on a very high dose of adderall, and have been for 15 years, and 2. without it I failed my classes (when I was a kid), got fired from my jobs, ruined friendships/relationships, and impulsivity got me in trouble with the law, ruined my credit score, etc. Also, to OP‚Äôs point, it‚Äôs almost impossible to finish a book/movie/tv show when it‚Äôs severe. Like severe means embarrassing, it‚Äôs likely to impair your ability to do basic math and reading comprehension. I don‚Äôt know if this makes any sense lol.

Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"Unsure if this applies to OP, but a lot of psychiatrists are trying ""new"" ADHDers on non-stimulants first in certain areas of the US, specifically rural areas with high rates of rx drug abuse. In these areas, pharmacists are making it absolutely brutal to try to pick up stimulants, even though they have no legal right to do so. Additionally, our supply is lower, and we experience shortages much more often. 

My psychiatrist basically explained that it's better to at least try and rule out the non-stimulant options first, if it's a non-crisis situation, since there's so many problems with getting the stimulants. He also refers to ADHD meds as ""the Wild West of Psychiatry"" and has said that a lot of psychiatrists in these areas are questioned if they prescribe ""too many"" stimulants, so a lot of them are starting with non-stimulants for a month or two, just to cover themselves in case they need to prove that the stimulants were required."
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"Personally, I am on Strattera. I have a history of alcohol abuse in my family and wanted to try a non-stimulant first even though I know stimulants are the first line. 

Honestly I‚Äôm seeing improvement on the Strattera so that‚Äôs been nice. I‚Äôm not taking a high dose but I can see the improvements already. I‚Äôm due to titrate up in a couple days but if my tomorrow dose is like yesterday I may shoot a message to my doctor to see if I can stay on the lower dose until I can get a grasp on the nausea and vomiting."

Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,My psych was the one who started me on WB to treat depression and said while anecdotally it can be helpful for ADHD it‚Äôs not going to manage those symptoms on it‚Äôs own. I think he prescribed the stimulants around the same time so I‚Äôve never taken Wellbutrin without a stimulant. I started at 150 and have been on 300 XL for years.

It was a rough couple weeks when I switched from Pristiq to Wellbutrin because you have to titrate down on one while titration up on the other and your body goes through a sort of moderate withdrawal period involving some depression spikes but I can‚Äôt think of any side effects. I take 40 mg vyvanse and 450 mg Wellbutrin. I also take amlodipine to lower my blood pressure. The only side effect I have arguably is I sweat a lot from the vyvanse. I always sweat a lot but it just cranks it up to 11 when I‚Äôm working.

Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"Yes. Contrary to many on this sub, i don't really like how focalin/Vyvanse makes me feel. Like it allows me to do school and office work, but it also makes anxious, irritable, and prone to mood swings (lord help whoever distracts me from what I'm focused on when i take Vyvanse). Not to be cheesy and corny, but i feel like I'm forcing myself to fit in a box just to contribute to society

The Wellbutrin mitigates most of that, while also allowing me to be productive. I also avoid taking focalin if i don't have school/work, and the Wellbutrin does enough in the off days to allow me to get by fine. 

I also find that focalin/Vyvanse limits my ability to think on my toes and react to new stimuli. Like if I'm playing rugby on focalin, i might be able to execute our gameplan perfectly, but my ability to react to the other team is noticably worse"

Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,They can but because it is not their expertise they are more careful with it and tend to put extra rules in place like monthly drug tests or lower doses then is required.  Its for good reason on their part.  The opioid crisis brought in much more oversite for Doctors and their prescribing habits when it comes to schedule 2 drugs.

Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"Not at all‚Ä¶ two hourish into my day, if I‚Äôm finding myself really focused on a non-preferred/overwhelming task, it‚Äôs because my meds started working.

I run my own group private practice, so I‚Äôm able to set my own hours. I am a night owl and typically get to bed by 2:30 AM. Since Vyvanse needs to interact with the digestive system to turn into the active ingredient, I set an alarm 90 minutes before I awake, to take the medication. My daughter takes a lower dose and an immediate release, so I wake her up 30 minutes early to take her medication.

When I met the office, my hours are from 10:30 AM to 7:30 PM. I leave the office around 8 PM and have a transition drive time of 35 minutes. When I get home, it‚Äôs just in time to not want to do anything else for the rest of the day associated with non-preferred, overwhelming activities. I no longer need to focus.

I hope that information helps."

My ADHD and depression seem to be causally circular. Many of the ADHD symptoms I was experiencing can look like bipolar. And I especially think the propensity to addiction associated with ADHD is often overlooked or attributed to other afflictions.

The anger was so intense you think I was roid raging, lol. Im glad Im not on it anymore, I don‚Äôt think I will take it ever again. On top of that it gave me pretty bad suicidal ideation, had a plan and everything. It was not for me whatsoever. ADHD meds make me feel the same way, calm, happy and content."
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"It is. 

I can't pick up my new Vyvanse until I'm totally out. Pharmacist had been refusing to give it to me until I was out for months, and I finally had a meltdown and shouted at her about 6 months ago. I'd been unmedicated for almost two weeks because without the Vyvanse, I can't remember to pick it up. I reminded her that it's illegal for her to withhold it and that the US government says I'm allowed to have my meds 3 days before I run out. Ever since, she's just conveniently been ""too busy"" to fill it until I'm completely out. She's not too busy for any of my other prescriptions, just the Vyvanse. 

If my psychiatrist changes my prescription halfway through the month, the pharmacist won't give me the new meds until he both calls and verbally tells her, and sends over written documentation stating that I will not continue taking the old medication, will not give it to anyone, and have already properly disposed of all previous medication. The pharmacist won't accept the same thing from my psychiatrist's nurse or from me. It has to come directly from the psychiatrist. 

The pharmacist also won't fill my Vyvanse refill if it's called in as a generic because she doesn't consider that to be a ""refill."" Even though my prescription is month-to-month, and my psychiatrist signs off on every refill after we've met in person. If the psychiatrist switches back and forth from generic to name brand, the pharmacist rejects it, and the psychiatrist has to re-send it as a ""new"" prescription. But of course, the pharmacist doesn't notify anyone that she's rejected it. 

It isn't a requirement for me to see the psychiatrist for every refill. In my state, I'm allowed 3 months between visits. But the pharmacist just refuses to fill it without documentation stating that I've been seen in-office (she won't even accept a virtual visit). 

She's been reported multiple times to multiple people, and no one will do anything about it. I wish non-stimulants worked for me, so I didn't have to deal with this every single month."
Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,"Thanks for the recommendations, I don‚Äôt think your comment is coming across as rude. It‚Äôs more information for me to look into.

Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,18 mg is like a starting dose. You have to ask for an increase after a few weeks or def yr next visit ..I think and goes up to 72 or 74 maybe even more. I was on 54mg when it started working as it should..still after -5- years I always have to change ADHD meds because they don't work as well .

Anyone here with *severe* ADHD that has had luck with Wellbutrin? ,I was switching providers but dr #2 wouldn‚Äôt prescribe stimulants unless I get a neuropsych testing again. So I went from taking stimulant medication to Wellbutrin alone. That‚Äôs probably why the inattention felt extra jarring.

"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.",Wellbutrin is one that either works great or makes your mood substantially worse unfortunately. It‚Äôs always a good idea to contact your MD if your mood gets worse instead of better. My doctor didn‚Äôt warn me there could be side effects with it either and she absolutely should have.

"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","Every single medication for *everything* comes with a long list of side effects ranging from mild to serious. Some people will have side effects and others will not, won't know until you take it.

Any medication your taking increases your anxiety or depression or is giving you a negative side effect you *immediately* contact your doctor.

The list of side effects should have been on a paper given to you when you get the medication. The pharmacy has to give you the paper with side effects to look out whenever you get prescribed a new medication and go over them with you."

"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","Yea, meds are definitely person dependent so you need a prescriber that you trust.   

Also tell your prescriber not only severe side effects (like dizziness, nausea, thoughts of harming yourself) but what has improved and what has not.  That helped me be diagnosed with ADHD.

Any time you are starting a new medication, or even if you've been on one for a while, ALWAYS tell your doctor right away if it seems like it isn't working or things are getting worse. Everyone reacts differently to different meds and to different doses of that same medication. It can even change over time. If something doesn't work for you, PLEASE tell your doctor and don't just suffer through it or assume there are no alternatives. Especially for something like an antidepressant or ADHD medication.

"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.",The problem with warning you about psychological symptoms is that nocebo effect can pretty much ensure that you get it if someone says you can.

"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","Wellbutrin was great for my moods and motivation, but it gave me the worst brain fog and short term memory issues. I had to wean myself off of it. Took me 8 months after my last dose to return as close to normal as possible. I really liked every other aspect about it, though! I just wish it didn't give me those side effects."
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","Important note:

Buproprion boosts dopamine. So if you have ever had issues associated with high dopamine levels, mania for example, bad side effects are more likely for you."
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","Wait me too! I just started seeing a new psychiatrist who stopped my Wellbutrin prescription immediately, said that it could be excarbating anxiety symptoms .."
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","Yeah, bupropion felt great for me‚Ä¶ and actively ruined my entire life. 

I took it for depression, before I knew I had adhd (it actually led to my diagnosis so thanks) Emotional disregulation, mild mania, loss of appetite, lost 30lbs in 3 months (went from a very gym-active 150lbs to a withering 117) liver problems, and it made me more forgetful when my dose was increased but‚Ä¶ my depression was gone so‚Ä¶ lmao. Point is, it‚Äôs definitely not for everyone. 

Please please please monitor your symptoms when you‚Äôre on it no matter how much improvement you see. It took me a long time to recover."
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","So weirdly, I take Wellbutrin, Bupropion and Adderall, and I have never felt better in my life.  Humans/biology are so freaking strange."
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.",I had a very similar reaction to Wellbutrin. 0/10 would not try it again. That feeling of emptiness that came from taking this drug is no joke
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","Wellbutrin gave me painful tinnitus that felt like it was damaging my ears, turns out that‚Äôs a known but rare occurrence. Kind of a crap drug."
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","Two of my very good friends take wellbutrin for their adhd and have for years. It worked remarkably well for them both. 

When I first went to my doctor for adhd related issues they prescribed wellbutrin and I had to stop taking it after about 3 weeks because I was having horrible reactions. Headaches, awful cystic acne, nausea, and it even caused kidney stones. It also made me pretty jumpy and I felt high strung as a result. 

A lot of people have really good reactions to wellbutrin though. And a lot of doctors don't really tell you what to expect or what to look out for, because I was in the same boat until I started doing some research on the medication. It's always important to ask your doctor what to expect and what to look out for though, and to keep notes on any changes you notice when you start new medications to show your provider. That helps them decide whether or not a medication is working right for you."
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.",Low dose naltrexone made me want to RIP myself.
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","For the first day I felt great, the second I was very irritable...and stayed irritable."
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","I was prescribed Wellbutrin a few years ago due to my depression and anxiety, and about 2 months in I was having the worst mood swings and was angry and irate about EVERYTHING.  Went and talked to my primary care about it instead of my mental health doctor because he wasn't listening to me, and my primary care took me off it."
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","I always worry about psychiatrists who want you to try Bupropion first. Like, is this their first rodeo?  Bupropion has some of the worst side effects and is the least likely to work. It's never even been evaluated by the FDA for adhd."
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","I started having memory loss on Wellbutrin.

I‚Äôd be driving home and forgot I even drove myself or I‚Äôd be working around the house and ask my wife where tools were like 3-4 times and it was in my hand.

Pretty alarming stuff, dumped that in the trash and switched to vyvanse"
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.",I got PSSD from wellbutrin it's been 4 years and i can't feel my dick aswell of a whole variety of other symptoms which might never return in my lifetime i wasn't warned for long term sexual aide effects
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","I was prescribed Bupropion recently to treat my depression. The first week of 150mg XL was fine but when I upped the dose to 300mg XL as prescribed, things got bad. I had no motivation, I didn't even feel like moving my arms when seated. I mostly felt numb, sad sometimes but I had never had so many suicidal thoughts or felt as hopeless as I did. After a week or so of that I messaged my psych and he told me to give it a few more weeks.

A little over a week after his reply it started working as it's supposed to for depression. I didn't think it would improve but my family immediately noticed the difference.

But I agree my psych also didn't give any big warning but there is a reason it has a black box warning."
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","Well fuck, I wanted to give it a shot as it supposedly isn't a ""hard"" anti-depressant and the frequency of sexual side effects ought to be much lower than in regular anti-depressants"
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","Drugs affect everyone differently. I do great on Welbutrin with my Celexa, which may explain why. I'm sorry your doctor didn't warn you about possible  signs the drug wasn't working well. She should have. Mine mentions it every time."
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.",I had frequent urination so badly that I had to pee every 20 min.  Also really bad nausea. I lasted a week before I called it quits. I could not get through my day.
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","Just to throw another experience of buproprion on here, I had a very good improvement to my executive function but I can't use it at all anymore.  


My problem was that after 2-3 weeks, I started to have an allergic reaction. Mostly a growing rash in my lower back, but also some respiratory swelling. So I couldn't continue using it, even though it helped me with getting work done, I had energy to take care of relationships, I didn't need to drink energy drinks and cut way down on candy and sweets.  


The funny thing was that I didn't have an ADHD diagnosis yet, my doctor prescribed it for my depression. This reaction led to me talking to a psychiatrist and now I'm a 41 year old ADHDer on Concerta.   


My point being, you will be on a journey when trying out treatment, medication and even coping strategies. I've been telling myself that ""I'm the idiot in idiosyncratic"", so that I can keep my expectations at a reasonable level. It's much easier to be pleasantly surprised than it is to see your hopes crumble."
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","The one side affect I'm actually sure of is reduced appetite. It's helped me loose weight, yeah, but it's almost like I don't want to eat food sometimes. Also I think it's making my stomach really sensitive. I seem to have stomach troubles regularly since I got increased to 450 mg last year. It also doesn't really feel like its doing anything for my ADHD. I want to try stimulant meds again but that messes up my stomach just as much as the Wellbutrin. I'm honestly at a loss right as to what to do. Im scared to decrease the it in case it is actually helping me and I just didn't notice."
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.",I was also anxious and emotionally sensitive on wellbutrin. My tremors were absolutely awful and i thought i was gonna have a seizure within 2 weeks of using it. I think it only helped my depression because it plagued my mind with even more hectic thoughts and distracted me. Did nothing for my ADHD. Also made me nauseous and i lost 10 pounds very quickly because it stumped my appetite.

"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","Keep in mind any NDRI, SSRI, anxiety med, methylphenidate, etc can make you feel this way if it‚Äôs not right for you. I‚Äôve been on Wellbutrin for a month and the first 2 weeks just felt neutral. The past 2 weeks have been pretty bad and past few days I feel HORRIBLE. For me it‚Äôs tough to know if it‚Äôs the meds doing this because I‚Äôve experienced these feelings sporadically for years."
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","The side effect I get from this one, personally, is shaky hands. An issue, as I'm an artist."
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","As some have mentioned already, nobody is going to have the exact same reaction to medicines. I have taken Wellbutrin for about 2 months now - my psych wanted to try it as a first med. It hasn't helped with the main ADHD symptoms, but tbh I had no idea how much anxiety I had from a lifetime of undiagnosed ADHD, so in that respect it has helped tremendously. I'm going to be starting a small Adderall dose in tandem with the Wellbutrin, and obviously I am going to have a very individual response compared to other Adderall users."
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","I had really bad muscle soreness/cramping when I started bupropion XL. It lasted about 7-10 days and then went away. It felt like I had done a really, really strenuous weightlifting session and then has delayed onset muscle soreness, but it lasted the entire week or longer at maximum soreness. It mostly affected my forearms, and I was unable to write normally for that week. Signing my name was practically impossible.

It all went away after that 7-10 day period (can‚Äôt remember exactly how long it lasted) and I feel completely normal now.

I started at 150 mg/day and was supposed to go to 300 mg/day after one week, but I delayed that a few days until I started to feel normal. Still on 300 mg/day"
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","Has anyone gotten extremely bloated while taking Wellbutrin?

"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.",Haha I was questioning all that so I got on Wellbutrin and it helped me come to the conclusion that I don‚Äôt want to live but I more or less have to so I will stick around.
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","I had a really shit first two weeks, then a really amazing few months. It seems to be working well overall though. It definitely is different for everybody"

"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","These work differently for different people, it definitely wasn‚Äôt for you but may very well help someone else.

I had the same experience with Vyvanse. It was overwhelmingly emotional and I felt like I had Parkinson‚Äôs disease. I thought I was dying. 

Adderral on the other hand is wonderful for me, and Ritalin.

But Vyvanse I won‚Äôt touch. Ever. Like it‚Äôs just a no."
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.",This is why it's soooo important to work with a psychiatrist for drugs (not therapy!) instead of a general practitioner
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.",Wellbutrin gave me visible hand tremors and helped not at all. Ymmv of course.
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","Wellbutrin has helped greatly reduce most of my OCD symptoms (pure intrusive thoughts). But I also had to go back on my other antidepressant when I realized I was crying over every tiny thing and upset most of the time. The two together are mostly good, but neither touch the ADHD symptoms. *sigh*
 
Every person will respond differently. Always research a new med‚Äôs possible side effects as much as you can before beginning."
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","So, my experience with Bupropion has been rather good so far (though there's some doubt). I have been medium level depressed for a longer time and I didn't want to ever touch meds again after I've only had SSRIs in the past (mainly venlafaxin) and only had bad experiences.
However, my doc got me to try Bupropion because I've always felt that my problem is less the serotonin and more the dopamin (my late ADHD diagnosis last year also fits here). So I've taken it and actually had some pretty bad weeks; though it's hard to say if it was because of the drug - winter montgs have always been rough for me.
However, after about 6 weeks, when I already thought I'd tell my doc I'd stop taking it, my depression suddenly went away. I was actually doing very well. And that was in January, normally my worst months every year (even when I'm not in a depressive episode). Also, almost no side effects (in contrast to venlafaxin that did a lot of bad stuff; I had to work hard for an orgasm e. g.). Blood pressure is a bit higher and at the start I've had some weird pressure on my ear and had the feeling I could feel the bass of some music played far away through my feet, lol. But that went away.
Now, at the moment I'm a bit doubtful if it's working that well still because I'm having some bad days. But tbh, how well can even a healthy person feel when they are in a shitty place in life (unemployed, broke, kinda alone, etc)? I'm not falling nearly as low as I did last year. 
It doesn't seem to change anything about my ADHD symptoms (is it supposed to?) and I'm still missing a bit of drive and energy, but yeah, I do think it helps with my depression."
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.",It didn't work for me but it does for some.
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.",I took it for depression and it was exactly what I needed at the time. I'm sorry your experience was so awful. I hate how difficult the journey is to find the right medications sometimes. I'm still trying to figure out the right meds myself. Stratterra gave me major depression in one day so I feel you in this. At the moment I'm focussing on fixing my anxiety so I'm weaning off of bupropion and starting on flouxatine. Then I'm going to be trying Vyvanse once I know that the other meds are working. It's so much trial and error.
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.",I take Wellbutrin. I have never experienced this.
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.",Bupropion made me extremely depressed/suicidal.  I'm doing great on Lexapro now.
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","Oh man for me it was life changing in the best way. I did end a long term relationship that was loooong overdue and moved countries the moment the medication kicked in. I kind of build my new life based on wellbutrin and now I don't have access to it anymore. So that sucks a little. But I have no regrets. 
My experience was that I dreamed of doing something drastic and was finally able to! I wish I could go back on wellbutrin. One of the most drastic things it helped me do was making phone calls. I miss that."
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","I used to take in on/off since 2018, it did help with focus and motivation, but I was also more anxious / aggressive. Had to stop it when changed from Escitalopram to vortioxetine because the combo made me vomit :(. After a year on low dose vortioxetine I realised it kept irritating my stomach so stopped it as well and the daily stomach pain resolved within a week (!). When I tried to come back to Wellbutrin (lowest dose), it gave me unbearable itch (but no rash) all over my body that lasted for weeks üò™. I stil don't understand why I suddenly reacted like that, I saw psychiatrist and neurologist and both said simply I should never take it again, without giving me an alternative nor explanation (the psy reffered me to another one specialised in ADHD but it worked out he doesn't take new patients). So yeah, maybe they assume that as long as I'm not suicidal everything is good huh ü§Æ, while I'm struggling every day to get out of bed and do anything, be it house chores or for work üòî."
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","Because there were so many great reviews for Wellbutrin, in fact I researched it for months and truly never came across more than maybe 2 bad reviews, I tried Wellbutrin for 6 months hoping it would level out and help me. It was the worst experience of my life and I became severely suicidal for the first time in my life. I finally came to my senses and stopped taking it. Although it‚Äôs been about 5 months since I last took it, I still have not gotten my full range of emotions back, and I‚Äôm terrified that it permanently damaged my brain. 

All that being said, I found out my parents both take an antidepressant that has the worst reviews on the internet, and it works perfectly for them both with no negative side effects. 

It really does depend on the person. The most important thing to take away from all this is to listen to your body and TRUST what it is trying to tell you. Only you actually know what works for you & what doesn‚Äôt"
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","I became suicidal, extremely depressed, and the rest I don‚Äôt remember. I had been dealing with depression for years but bupropion sent me to psych ward and months (until now) of antidepressants, mood stabilisers, panic attacks and my third time at the psych ward (now at least for three times a week meetings)."
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.",Omg.. I just realized the connection now. I randomly vegan overanalyzing my every move and every single person and thing in my life. It was driving me insane like why all of a sudden is this happening. Even in public in a line up thinking oh no I didn't give that cashier long enough eye contact she must think I'm rude or thinking if my friend said my hair made me look younger when it was cut then he must think I'm ugly now that it's grown out. Stupid things I'd never care about before. I'm currently tapering off. It will be interesting to see if that goes away.
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","I was prescribed it to get off my nicotine addiction and after three days, I'm already getting this dizzy feeling that seems to come on DURING my lifts at the gym. I never get dizzy so I'm convinced it's gotta be this. Just going to stop the pills and use old fashioned willpower to stop vaping. That's my experience with it at least, assuming it is these pills. That's the only recent change I've made."
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","I think the general consensus is: medication effects everyone differently. It‚Äôs less that you weren‚Äôt warned of the side effects, just that it‚Äôs not the right medication for you."
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","Yeah, I‚Äôve taken Wellbutrin for years at a pretty high dose, and I have never had a single side effect. It is not a perfect drug and definitely doesn‚Äôt control my ADHD symptoms completely. But it alleviates my depression from being shitty at everything I do, so it‚Äôs worth it.

Threads like these make people who had bad experiences want to share, which is not necessarily a bad thing. It‚Äôs just not the whole picture."
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","/\/\/\

This is really important.

I also had a horrible experience with Wellbutrin. (Without getting into details, some things happened while I was wacked out on it and my girlfriend's family hates me now...)

BUT, THIS IS ONLY BECAUSE

1)I personally, had a bad experience, which is anecdotal and not generalizable
2) I wasn't aware of the potential for these side effects.

Just be aware of potential side-effects and allow yourself to be ok with the fact that going through the ""trying different meds"" process will be a rocky road. You will eventually get to a more stable place but you need to be ok with and aware of going on the ride."
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","It worked amazing well for my depression, until I started having grand mal seizures when they adjusted a different med üôÑ 

That being said I‚Äôm pretty sure Wellbutrin has a black box warning for suicidality."
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","It works amazingly for my moms depression, which is why I requested to try it! Unfortunately, It did not work for me. I‚Äôm sensitive to serotonin and the combo of adderall and Wellbutrin increased my anxiety. So even with half the same genetics we had different outcomes, and the best thing to do is track your symptoms closely and advocate for yourself with the supervision of your doctor when changing meds."
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.",Wellbutrin worked wonders on my depression!
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","Yeah I was about to say I‚Äôve taken it for 6 months and I‚Äôve had a great experience with it.  Helps with energy, motivation, self-control when it comes to desserts‚Ä¶"
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.",And because it complements stimulants like Vyvanse really well. My experience with it has been pretty good.
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","Very true. From my experience, Wellbutrin was one of the only antidepressants that didn't give me negative side effects, many of which were hard to deal with. Of course, someone in my family has had great success with Lexapro for her depression, a medication that made me clench my teeth so hard I literally could not eat solid food because of how much my teeth and jaws hurt.

Unfortunately, there's a part of psychiatry that's very trial and error, and you really don't know how a medication will affect you until you get a prescription."
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.",Absolutely!! Wellbutrin made me shake like I had too much coffee but didn‚Äôt absolutely ruin my life like Paxil so ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","YUP. There's a reason they make the boxes impossible to open without taking the patient information leaflet out first! Doctors don't usually tell people about side effects unless it interacts with your other meds they know you're taking, they tell you to read the packet. Buproprion can make 1/10 people depressed and anxious, same with almost every stimulant and antidepressant (and most meds let's be honest lol)"
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","I really wish the site crazymeds.us was still up/active, it did a great job summarizing user-contributed reports and descriptions of the types of side effects etc different meds, in a much clearer and digestible format than those wall-of-text-to-cover-corporate-asses sheafs of paper."

"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","I am kind of disturbed by this kind of comments, honestly. Did you see a list of possible side effects on the prospect of Wellbutrin? There is like tens of them, it's not like you can easily figure if what is happening to you is a side effect of a med or there is some other reason for it. Depression was not even among common side effects... 

As far as I read, it's an off label drug for ADHD so it's not like there is tons for knowledge out there."
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","I ask myself why, because look at the comments....

Dextroamphetamine and methylphenidate both helped and gave mood boosts (already at small doses) while bupropion made me more depressed than ever, I have no clue why that was but I have seen other people say the same so there must be some mechanism (maybe dopamine at the wrong location) that is not due to high dopamine (stims increase dopamine significantly more than bupropion)"

"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","I wouldn't say it has some of the worst side effects, although I agree regarding efficacy - it's not potent enough to significantly improve core ADHD symptoms. It can also negatively impact memory (via its anti-nicotine mechanism) and increase seizure risk at higher doses."
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","Yep, that's due to its anti-smoking mechanism - antagonizes nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which are important for memory. It's unfortunate because it can be a pretty effective antidepressant."
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","Genuinely curious, how did you get ""Post-SSRI Sexual Dysfunction"" from Wellbutrin... Bupropion isn't an SSRI. 

Wellbutrin is one of the few antidepressants that doesn't cause sexual side effects"

"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","I take a high dose of Wellbutrin everyday and it has been awesome for me. I take it for depression and I also take adderall for my adhd and it has been a life changing combo for me. 

Don‚Äôt be afraid to try it!"
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","Exactly. Had I read this thread a year ago I would be reluctant to try it when my doctor perscribed it to me, but it's what was able to help me deal with my depression and I'm so glad I gave it a try. I had a bad experience with Prozac, but that doesn't mean that it's a bad drug, it just wasn't for me. When we have a better understanding of how these drugs work we'll be able to fit them to people based on their biology, but we're just not there yet so we have to fit them manually for now."
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.",Same.
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.",Same! Grand man seizure! But I still miss how effective it was. I had to assemble a giant cocktail of drugs to replace it.
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.",This side effect scared the crap out of me -so I only took it for two days.
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.",Unlikely to be related to serotonin as both Adderall and Wellbutrin mainly increase norepinephrine and dopamine. Probably too much norepinephrine causing anxiety.
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.",This is so good to hear!  How long did it take to start working?  I‚Äôm on week 2 of 150mg of Wellbutrin.
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","I wish it helped me with desserts lol

But it‚Äôs worked great for me (also with Vyvanse and Ritalin). My SO and dad hated though, so I think it‚Äôs just making sure to follow up with your Dr if it doesn‚Äôt work sooner then later"

"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","My pharmacy stopped giving out information leaflets that are specific to a drug, they are now all the same leaflet that basically says ""this drug may have known side effects"" with no list of what to look out for. Like was it that hard to include a useful leaflet?"
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","If it's making your mood worse you should talk to your doctor, it's not supposed to be like that.

Are you still taking it ? I started 2 weeks ago and since yesterday I feel likd shit..very low mood and very tired üò•"
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","I don't quite get being disturbed by me encouraging you (and anyone) to advocate for yourself which includes knowing what's going into your body and how it works. And yes,  Wellbutrin does not specifically state depression but many of it's side effects can easily present as that.  Hell, suicidal thoughts is one of the side effects.  That's likely going to present as depression. I wasn't knocking you specifically, I'm just a huge fan of advocating for ones self and tend to try and encourage that.  But, everyone has their own journey I suppose."
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","It's another way to say that there are not many people who report having adverse side effects outside expected ones\*

\*Note: When companies do human trials, anything the participants receiving the medication reports basically gets added as a side-effect. Even if the drug may not have caused it (hence why a lot of drugs have ""Headaches"" as a side-effect)"
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.",Yeah it's all more complex and really even the docs don't totally know how it all works. I just know that my friends with manic tendencies did NOT do well on buproprion.
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","Um‚Ä¶ no, I just meant that we realized I had adhd after that experience. I said it ‚Äúled to my diagnosis‚Äù not that it caused adhd or made it worse. There‚Äôs a long story smushed in between there, but ‚Äúled to my diagnosis‚Äù summarized it well enough for the point."
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","For me, it was sudden onset over the course of a week with the drugs. Once I stopped taking them all of the side effects went away. At one point it made me have suicidal thoughts which is EXTREMELY out of character for me."
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.",Prescribe what with Wellbutrin?
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","it's only 30ish% more likely than placebo to help at all, compared to 60-70+% over placebo for the methylphenidate and dextroamphetamine based drugs.

But my point was what kind of quack goes for off-label treatments before even trying the real ones?"
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","You absolutely can get it from wellbutrin some others got it from wellbutrin also, not everyone react the same from theses drugs. Wellbutrin is an ndri , and yes it can cause negative sexual side effects in some individuals"
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.",I got rTMS. Complete game changer.
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","It took a month or so for me to feel noticeably different on welbutrin.

"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","Antidepressants usually take 4-6 weeks to have a noticeable effect. I find that I forget how much it helps regulate me until I skip my meds for a couple days (thanks ADHD!).

Give it another couple weeks. I also take Celexa 40mg and between those two, my depression is almost completely gone."
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","It took me about 3-4 weeks to start working.

"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.",Yea I am on wednesday cause it marks 1 month on it.  So I guess I'm gonna taper off of it but no idea what we're gonna try next.  I think I need to go to a psychiatrist for an evaluation
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.",Yea I‚Äôm still taking it. I still have bad days that last a day or two but at this point I think a lot of it is attributed to being disappointed with where I am in life. So for me it‚Äôs normal. If it‚Äôs got you feeling worse than you were before then tell your doctor. The depressive episodes I have are in line with what I have felt before
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","1. On my leaflet, it only stated ""irritability"" and ""anxiety"" maybe regional thing... weird 
2. This is awesome if after reading comes with your meds you remember it in detail and are able to conclude if what happened to you is a side effect or something else,  especially if the side effects are emotional. For me, I started feeling like shit, was questioning my own judgment and was not sure if I was depressed before or not...

It would really freaking help if the doc said: Hey you might feel depressed, if you do, and it lasts longer than a few days, let me know."
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","That's interesting, thanks"
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.",They often give you wellbutrin in addition to naltrexone. Contrave is actually just the two in one pill.
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.",Hence why I said I agree with you regarding efficacy. I was only disagreeing regarding the side effects.
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","You can only get ""post-SSRI sexual dysfunction"" from taking SSRIs... It's literally in the name? 

Studies have shown that Wellbutrin does not cause sexual side effects, and certainly not long-term side effects after you stop taking the medication.

Are you sure you're not thinking about another drug?"
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.",Amazing!!  Do you take it alone or with something else?  I‚Äôm trying to get off of Lexapro due to the fatigue.

"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.","Nope, wellbutrin also as known as bupropion. I've seen enough specialist in my 4 years . although rare it can happen. For me it happened when i upped my dose and 4 years later the rest is history. Not every studies there are always some outliers you never know if there is already a weakness in a person."
"Psych did not warn me about possible awaful side effects of Bupropion, so I warn you.",I used to take benzos but I got off them about a year ago. I still take Adderall as needed for adhd. But that's it for mental health meds.

Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Doc tried Wellbutrin for me before they finally tried stimulants.

Wellbutrin for me was a big negative. Brain fog, apathy, etc, got much worse."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I have taken wellbutrin with other adhd meds for about 6ish years now and I love it. 

It really helps with my depression which I have terrible issues with and it doesn't help that adhd and depression feed off each other. 

But what made me do it was my dad told me, ""You have your grandmothers depression. You act like her when she's depressed, try wellbutrin it works for her and it might work for you."" And he was right.

Right now my doc wants to try and ween me off wellbutrin over time so I can function without it.

But im kinda on the fence about it because I don't think I could ever crawl back out of that hole I was in again. I've made it so far since then and I don't wanna go back.

Everyone's brain chemistry is different. It will take a lot of trial and error. Make sure you watch yourself and have a buddy or a family member watch over you the first 3 to 4 months. (thats how long it takes to kick in or see results)

I've taken antidepressants that made me feel like a grey blob and no other emotions. And it scared the crap outta me when I finally realized what was going on.

Good Luck."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Wellbutrin literally made me want to to be mean to people. Not even lying. I‚Äôm the nicest person and care about everyone.

Edit: first word was I instead of It."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I know a pair of brothers who really like Wellbutrin with no negatives at all. But on these forums I hear a lot of downsides. Idk how much it helps for ADHD, more than zero, but not a ton. It's certainly helpful for mood and energy levels.

My partner was on Straterra when he started Wellbutrin and his doc said the Wellbutrin made the Straterra irrelevant. Presumably because they're both norepinephrine drugs? Idk if that's the normal opinion or just one doc's opinion."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I take 300mg daily with 60mg of Vyvanse. 
I started Wellbutrin before officially being rediagnosed with ADHD.

Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I was on Wellbutrin (bupropion) for almost a year. For me, it only really helped for the first days, perhaps a week or two. The effect started waning quite fast. Towards the end, it was still slightly helping, but not worth the money or the side effects, which for me was mostly dampening of feelings, getting less pleasure from things.

I'm still in queue to get diagnosed, so I haven't had anything else, so can't compare to other ADHD meds."

It doesn‚Äôt help with everything but has been super helpful and I‚Äôll probably ask to pair it with a stimulant to see what happens.

I tried Qelbree and it did help with some symptoms and rumination but made me super anxious"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I took Wellbutrin but had to stop because it caused me to have seizures with no history of seizures!
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"For me it took about a month for the Wellbutrin to hit, and when it did, it actually hit me pretty hard. I took it before and now with vyvanse. 

How hard? My mother used to have a hoarding problem, but when she paid off her credit cards and fixed her credit, the compulsive need to keep everything ‚Äújust in case‚Äù finally started waning. 

There was a whole room in our house that was basically sealed off because it was so full of junk, it wasn‚Äôt the only place, but it was the worst. 

I was a few months out of high school, planned a gap year (if I had only known‚Ä¶ this was late 2018) when the Wellbutrin properly hit, I spent roughly a month straight cleaning out the room, moving furniture, stripping the carpet, and organizing everything sentimental or useful. I had so much energy my skin itched. 

After I did everything I could in the room, I went into the backyard and tore down the 9.5-10 Ft tall, roughly 16 ft wide wooden frame play fort that took four of my family members to set up. And they had power tools. 
I used grandad‚Äôs hand saw, blunted hatchet, and a hammer. It took longer but I needed to *move* or I‚Äôd start to scream for some sort of acute stimuli

After that was done I finally evened out, so it took one month to work and another month for my skin to stop being itchy from the restlessness, and a third for my body to be able to relax with intent. 

It was and still is 200mg SR."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I'm on it now as an antidepressant along with stimulants and I love it. Works better for me than any SSRI ever did.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"That one is interesting.  If your brain doesn‚Äôt need it, you‚Äôll probably know soon, it‚Äôll complain.  If your brain does need it, it may just settle down and complain much less.  

The weird thing about that one is how subtle it can be.  

It seems like it isn‚Äôt doing anything, you‚Äôre just repeatedly having decent days, where not much goes wrong.  Then it wears off or you miss a dose completely, and it‚Äôs like you forgot to put on shoes before going out for a quick run."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I take Wellbutrin for anxiety and it works well. That said, I was diagnosed with ADHD after bring on it for a few years. It didn't do anything for those symptoms."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I'm on both wellbutrin and starterra, though I went on the wellbutrin first. It's been more of an antidepressant for me and didn't help resolve my adhd, so I added straterra. It took about 4 or 5 weeks for wellbutrin to fully kick in.¬†"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I take Wellbutrin and adderall. I get no stim effect from the Wellbutrin, but it is a good antidepressant and practically magical for smoking cessation."

Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"wellbutrin hasn't helped my attention, but it did help my depression. the effect on my adhd is minimal at best it's like I'm a little more ""here"" and a little less ""everywhere""



also, I get the bupropion sweats. if I sit completely still, I'm fine. as soon as I think of getting up, I pour. but they say that goes away eventually... that seems to be a common side effect"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Wellbrutrin helped me a TON. I had severe depression and made a few life changes including taking wellbrutrin and now I only have mild depression (which I don‚Äôt think is something any medication can fix). I also have zero side effects from it.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I'm 9 days into Wellbutrin and I haven't seen any effects yet. Time will tell I guess.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I have been taking Wellbutrin for almost 30 years.   It takes 6 - 8 weeks to kick in, but it does help.   I take it in addition to a stimulant.  The stimulant is def the star of the show, but Wellbutrin always makes the stimulant work better and helps with symptoms 24 hours, making my evenings a bit more productive after the stimulant wears off.

I never lost any hair while taking it. I did have some pretty intense side effects when i started it (but it was when it only came as instant release and not the sustained release that I take now).  Mainly  my side effect was insomnia and just  being in a bad mood.   Those wore off in about 6 weeks of use.  

30 years later I still have a full head of hair.  Only went off it while I was pregnant with my daughter.   She is now 25 and a civil engineer.She is such a great kid, I Iook at her and think I would be more like her if I didn't struggle with ADHD undiagnosed until age 20.  

My finals thoughts on medications is they give you the ability to overcome your ADHD but you have to put in the work to overcome it. Working with a therapist who  specializes in ADHD or even an ADHD coach, to learn how to be more efficient with your time and bypass some of those ADHD coping skills, that you probably don't need when you are medicated.   There are many more resources out there now then back when I was 19 and being diagnosed for the first time.  I would have never finished college let alone my masters without Wellbutrin and Dexedrine.  But I had to work much harder than the rest of my classmates to achieve those degrees. 

It will always be a struggle, it's not fair, but at least with these meds we get a fighting chance.  I hate these shortages and wish our government would get their butts in gear and fix things.

I hope this info is helpful, best wishes!"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Lol, I actually just started on it. I‚Äôve been on stimulants for a long time, but I‚Äôve recently had some potentially severe health issues and we both agreed a non-stimulant would be better to try.

For pure ADHD, though, I think Straterra has much higher quality evidence of efficacy. It‚Äôs not so much an evidence of absence with Wellbutrin, though, as a lack of high quality clinical trials. That could just be because it‚Äôs already approved for a ton of things so there isn‚Äôt much incentive to get it approved for additional uses (huge problem with psychoactive drugs).

If I was a doctor right now, I‚Äôd probably start people on a non-stimulant for the sole reason that shortages on stimulants are such a shit show right now. C2 controlled drugs are also a giant pain and can get really expensive with the number of appointments you need to make.

For example: leaving on vacation? Better hope you didn‚Äôt time things poorly and run out of your medication half way through. Lose your medication somehow? Better hope your doctor and pharmacist believe you and have sympathy."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I was on strattera, now on Wellbutrin, but both always in combination with stims for me. I like it better but you‚Äôre right that it seems results are very mixed.

I was definitely used to the new med within 3 weeks, that does seem like a while even though everyone is different. Since there‚Äôs no direct conversion between strattera and Wellbutrin dosage, it might also be worth having a dosage conversation with your doctor if you continue not seeing it work."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,A long story I‚Äôm sorry. Have been on either adderall or vyvanse for years. Child started having issues and I couldn‚Äôt stop my brain from monologuing every failure mode. My doc added Wellbutrin when I admitted the difficulty and it definitely helped. I could sleep without the constant going over of how we were all going to die over and over again. It definitely helped that. I am still taking it and won‚Äôt stop until there is a good reason. Does it help with the adhd symptoms? Maybe a small amount but not like any other med I‚Äôve tried.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Been on Wellbutrin for 20+years 

No bad effects but a good one -- I haven't had a single migraine since I started

Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I used to take it for ‚Äúdepression.‚Äù It took away the depressive feelings I had but did nothing for my ADHD.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"For me Wellbutrin was ok but eventually made me sweat an absurd amount. And it wasn‚Äôt like normal sweating, I would sweat from every inch of my skin and it felt like the sweat was taking away my energy as it left my body. Any kind of physical activity would trigger it, I couldn‚Äôt even do basic chores without feeling sick. I had to stop taking it. It worked a little bit but it wasn‚Äôt worth it at all."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Wellbutrin made me want to tare my skin off, and it always felt like I was falling, vertigo couldn‚Äôt begin to describe what I was feeling."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Adding Wellbutrin to my stim made me superwoman. I have all the focus. I hope it works for you but everybody is different.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Combined with Adderall xr it's amazing. I think I need to up the wellbutrin tho but overall no negative side effects
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Be careful with Wellbutrin. I just got out of the hospital because I was manic for 2 months and didnt realize I was being extremely irritable, short tempered, and irrational. (I was taking it with Vyvanse 40mg btw and found out I have bipolar so take this as you will)"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Wellbutrin was better for me after the rage wore off. It is subtle but I noticed I was folding my laundry as soon as it dried and refilling the ice tray immediately without prompting. Never in all my years have I done those things so efficiently. I do feel a little apathetic while on it but I kind of like that. I do take 5mg of lexapro while on it to keep a little of the edge off.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"It was slow to work. When it did, it did seem to help quiet my mind and that helped so much with work. I was also very depressed when I started it, and although it did help my depression, I felt flat and apathetic. One of the first things I noticed after stopping was feeling more bonded with my children. I also think it messed with my short term memory."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I was taken off stimulants (for no reason except the doctor wanted to) which worked great for me. I tried Stratterra but couldn't hack the hideous side effects. So them they. put me on Wellbutrin.

Wellbutrin is great if you have depression or anxiety. I did not. But the drug removed ALL sense of urgency and I blew off very important tax filing and payment deadlines, both personal and business, for three years, got us into $80K of debt, and it took about 8 years to pay off. I was not able to start turning the ship around until I went back on stimulants.

I have told my doctor that if they take me off stimulants again, I may as well jump off the bridge, as it will be quicker.

However, due to massive life issues, I now ALSO have depression, and I am taking Wellbutrin for that along with Concerta for my ADHD and they are both working very well."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,gave me a panic attack.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I‚Äôm currently on it for just depression. It took about two weeks to kick in. I‚Äôm at the end of week 3 currently. The prescribing psych said it can positively affect adhd symptoms, but I cannot imagine taking it instead of my adderall. It does make my executive functioning easier to deal with, but there is no way I could use it exclusively for adhd. I still feel like shit when I don‚Äôt take my adderall too."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I did . worked ok in my pregnancy. Tried it again after a decade and it caused awful, awful anxiety ."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I was on it 28 yrs for depression. Turns out I was hypothyroid and not depressed.

Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Are all stimulant formulations in shortage?

Wellbutrin made me more alert, but it did not help me focus. It also made me anxious af."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I couldn't take stimulants and got serotonin syndrome on Straterra so the Dr had me try Wellbutrin. I didn't have many side effects and it helped quite a bit for the anxiety. For the ADHD the best thing it did was help me to remember to put clothes in the hamper instead of the floor and brush my teeth at night.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I took it for a month 100mg which is the lowest dose did nothing but help regulate my emotions better
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"My wife takes Wellbutrin, I'd say it helps but it's nothing compared to actual stimulants. But she's only on 300mg and the max dosage is 450 so she has room to go up. 
I currently take Adderall. What really helped it actually was nortriptyline at night. I'm not sure how but that really helps with the focus in combination with Adderall. I've been able to reduce my dosage since starting nortriptyline."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I got the worst rash ever from Wellbutrin felt like my hands were being roasted over a fire and broke out in hives. I‚Äôm on pristiq now
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,It helped for a couple weeks. No negatives except some headaches. Just stopped working after a few weeks. And didn‚Äôt really help with my ADHD. It helped with depression slightly.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I took it for almost 20 years before my new doctor took me off of it and said it contributed to my anxiety. This was after a psych evaluation and ADHD diagnosis, to be clear. Now I take 20 mg escitalopram per day and 20-40 mg generic Adderall XR. School year is starting so I‚Äôm also starting a new prescription of 5-10 mg Adderall IR in the afternoons when I crash. I‚Äôm in music education and have several late afternoon and nightly events per week."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Wellbutrin helps me with fatigue, depression, and anxiety on the right dose. When my dose was too high it made me incredibly angry 24/7"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I take Wellbutrin. It helps, but not enough. I had a TERRIBLE reaction to Straterra (horrendous nightmares), so got off that.

Am waiting for an appt with a psychiatrist to go more in depth with my meds and see what else to try‚Ä¶"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I took several SSRI's that only made me feel numb and foggy. Then I got switched to Wellbutrin, and it was the only antidepressant that actually did something for my depression and anxiety. I took it many years before being diagnosed with ADHD, and once I finally got diagnosed I found that stimulants worked a lot better."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I wanted to like Wellbutrin but the side effects (nausea and extreme irritability) were just too much for me.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"The racing thoughts have mostly died down. Hasn't helped with anything else.

One side effect is tinnitus. Got that one. At first I actually  thought it was the sound of silence."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Bupropion has been a game changer for me, predominantly alleviating depressive symptoms & GAD. I find it‚Äôs slightly augmented the effects of my dexies, too. 
I was on duloxetine initially at 120mg but I‚Äôve weaned to 30mg(as the dose was unnecessarily high) and the combination with bupropion works really well. That being said what works for some may not work for others."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"It completely changed my life but after about a year on it, even at the highest dose it stopped working. :("
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I tried wellbutrin but it made me so angry and then I got pregnant and I was a downright asshole to my husband. I  got off it and suddenly I wasn't picking fights over stupid stuff and my hormones calmed down for the most part (I still cried so easily) so just be careful of that side effect
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Wellbutrin helped kind of mitigate  my adhd symptoms a bit. I do better on stimulants but I was on Wellbutrin for a few years before I was diagnosed (long story for how I didn‚Äôt know, but I think Wellbutrin helped there.) 

I didn‚Äôt have many side effects on it. The only one I noticed that kind of bothered me was an extreme uptick in my libido. I have seen others discussing it like a guy saying he felt like a teenager again. I don‚Äôt mention these to be crass, it‚Äôs the only side effect I remember. 

It‚Äôs different for everyone though. My mom was on it for a while and she lost a lot of weight after she got off it. (She believed it made her gain weight and her psychiatrist noticed that in some patients. I think it helped me keep some weight off so that whole thing is confusing for me.) 

I can‚Äôt remember how long it takes to take effect, but six weeks seems to be standard for a lot of antidepressants. Best of luck with your medication though"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I have been taking adderall for 18 years and Wellbutrin for 7 years. Wellbutrin makes me a better person. I can‚Äôt go a day without it
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I currently take Bupropion XL for seasonal depression in addition to Adderall.

Before diagnosis, Bupropion was the first drug to give me a quiet brain.

What form of Wellbutrin are you taking and what dose? ¬†If you don‚Äôt experience any effect they should be increasing your dose if they haven‚Äôt already."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I‚Äôve been doing Wellbutrin for something like 4 years now and it‚Äôs the last thing that I DIDNT try lol. I‚Äôve held steady with it, and when I finally got my adhd confirmed and put on adderall it unlocked my ability to focus and be productive. Hand in hand- best combo I‚Äôve found"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Wellbutrin was amazing for the first month. After that it didn't do much for my adhd.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"No positives for me, a little more tired than normal but definitely useable. Didn‚Äôt help me enough to even remember to take it so tbf it never was consistent enough to work"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I found it helpful. Not as helpful as stimulants but a lot better than nothing. It helped my depression a lot and helped my adhd like 50%. It worked within the first week for me. I usually get anxiety and insomnia for like a week when I start taking it but it goes away after
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"On WB (highest dose), Zoloft, and Adderall. My doctor added the Wellbutrin later on to the Zoloft after it had stopped working as well. It almost gave the Zoloft a ‚Äúboost‚Äù but it truly does depend!"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Straterra: only lasted three days, immobilized by severe nausea that persisted for 4 hours each day. Can‚Äôt be a stay at home parent and also bed bound
Wellbutrin: whooooo boy did that suck, first day hit with ideation that only got stronger the longer I took it
Lexapro: gave me panic attacks and also heightened my ideation
‚Äî-
I‚Äôm just on Vyvanse now with Ativan as needed for panic. Tired of playing medical roulette to be honest"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Wellbutrin is an antidepressant, and takes about as long to start working as most antidepressants (4-6 weeks). I hear that some people get some benefit using it for ADHD but that hasn't been my experience. I use Wellbutrin for my depression and a stimulant for my ADHD. I actually got diagnosed with ADHD after being on Wellbutrin a while because it wasn't dealing with those symptoms."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Wellbutrin caused me to have a seizure. If u have a low seizure threshold I would consider switching to something else
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Wellbutrin has helped with my fibromyalgia. I have severe body pain without it. It's very odd. I had chronic pain prior, but it's just different and worse."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Wellbutrin helped a lot with my depression but did nothing for ADHD. 

it takes a month or two to feel a difference. and it's really subtle, like one day I just kind of realized ""I feel better lately. oh. must be the Wellbutrin."" 

I think it was like 6-8 weeks after I started taking it"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Wellbutrin helped my depression but it did shit all for my ADHD
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,it made me angry. i felt like a rage monster. didn't like it
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?," It didn‚Äôt really have any noticeable effect on me, so I went off it after a number of months."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I hated it‚Ä¶ shit wasn‚Äôt great, didn‚Äôt really give a plus in my live kinda made things more flat. Also, I would get dizzy randomly from it and very often. I don‚Äôt recommend"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"My doctor said ""you've grown out of adhd so it's most likely anxiety"" and had me try welbutrin because i told him i couldnt get my brain to shut up. After nearly a month, I was experiencing issues with emotional regulation and having rage just out of the blue. I also became wildly impulsive and intrusive thoughts would win most of the time, which led to me playing real life Frogger (because I thought it would be fun for some reason), screaming at my kids for absolutely nothing, to me nearly stabbing my husband with a fork. I went back to my doctor and told him what was happening and he said I needed to ""give the medicine time"". I told him everything was better before the welbutrin and refused to continue taking it. Then we talked about my chatty brain. I told him I wasn't constantly ""thinking"" because thinking implies direction in thought. I was constantly ""pondering"" (which rhymes with wandering, which has no exact direction). After 10 min of me talking, he agreed that I hadn't ""outgrown"" my adhd and put me on adderall."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,It felt like Wellbutrin made me depressed. Like more than a low grade ennui.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Yeah I HATED it.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Wellbutrin made me very anxious in the beginning but after a week it started to kick in as in I could do a little more and focus a little better.  Also helped a bit with the co-morbidities but in the end wasn‚Äôt enough. I should say I was also prescribed Fluoxetine at the same time. But as far as the ADHD symptoms went, I only found real relief when my doctor added. Ritalin LA. My levels are good. Giving me enough motivation to be able to work on strategies to counter symptoms, set goals and work towards them with as much consistency as I can muster. Everyone is different. I was very lucky that I‚Äôve had no bad side effects from the amount of medication I‚Äôm on so you must speak to your doctor."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Wellbutrin didn't help me, probably good for someone."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Wellbutrin made my wife and I incredibly angry.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I had pretty bad headaches and racing heart on Wellbutrin. But it otherwise worked fairly well.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I was on strattera 3 months before I had to stop. At first I loved it. The nausea and throwing up every morning for weeks was no fun but I feel like it helped. Then kinda out of nowhere something flipped and I was not ok mentally and switched. I got on ‚Äúguanfacine‚Äù now. It‚Äôs only been a month but so far I like it. I also just today added cymbalta (anti depressant) and I take gabapentin for anxiety.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Mine took about a week to kick in üëç
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"It helps my other meds, that‚Äôs why I take it"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I was on wellbutrin for about a year and a half for depression not knowing it was also used for ADHD. I noticed no differences in my symptoms when I stopped taking it.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I was on it at many doses for a long time before adderall. I didn‚Äôt notice any difference with any adhd symptoms I‚Äôm afraid.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I take wellbutrin but it does nothing for my adhd. It helps my depression but thats about it. I dont think i had any side effects when I started it, but my memory is shoddy at best."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I was on it for a month. My irritability was through the roof and I had borderline rage issues.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Neither of those worked on me and I was allergic to Wellbutrin. Try to find a local pharmacy and see if you can get your normal prescription filled there
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I‚Äôm on it but not for ADHD. I don‚Äôt take it often only as needed! I use it for depression and it works pretty instant. I take it around or after my periods whenever my depression gets bad .
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I felt absolutely nothing, so they kept upping the dose until I went into a temporary psychosis üôÉ
Needless to say it didn‚Äôt work out."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I went on Wellbutrin when I was in my early 20s and it was awful. It made me super depressed and apathetic. I'm responsive to stimulants, so I've found that Pristiq (an SNRI) and Concerta XR is the best combination for me. Good luck!"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Just one person's experience, but I started with Wellbutrin when I was hesitant to try stimulants when I learned I had ADHD. I noticed some improvements about two weeks in with reduced anxiety, similar to Cipralex which also worked for me to reduce anxiety, but it felt like I got the same benefits with less negatives compared to Cipralex. That was all dandy for about two months when I realized I had set the bar really low and should try stimulants, and I'm glad I did. I'm currently assessing whether I want to continue taking stimulants, but in no way am I considering SSRIs or SNRIs. I've found doctors are so careless with assessing for side effects with these kind of drugs and I'm not willing to roll the dice again on having long lasting impacts from discontinuing them. So personally, Wellbutrin was fine for me and the least harmful of the SSRI/SNRI club, but didn't really treat the ADHD that it was worth taking over or with stimulants."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"It helped me a decent amount at first. I actually liked the 150 MG dose. However, when I got moved up to 300 MG, I got really bad ringing in my ears so be careful!"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,i just started it. i was on adderall then vyvanse for years and wanted to stop stimulants. i don‚Äôt notice much right now but i hope it helps soon
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Wellbutrin + guanfacine. Dr added in caffeine pills during the stim shortage. 80% and I was able to keep my life moving ahead. I still take caffeine when my stim is out of stock.

I enjoy knowing that if my stim isn't available, or my dr decided to stop scripting stims (which is happening in our area), that my life can move forward just fine. Gives me confidence. Granted, I do better when a stim is included, but thanks to the stim shortage my dr worked with me to find a good backup."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,It works great for me
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,My doc prescribed Wellbutrin as a starting point for ADHD meds. It  brought very dark thoughts (‚ò†Ô∏è). After 3 weeks I had to stop. Tried Concerta after that and it worked wonders. On Vyvanse now and it‚Äôs worked the best so far.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I use wellbutrin to counter my SSRIs withdrawal symptoms
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Wellbutrin has miraculous for my depression but didn't help at all for ADHD, so personally I take a stim on top of it. They don't seem to interfere too much  except that I feel like it's contributed to stimulants having a lower threshold at which they make me sleepy, making the therapeutic window very narrow but manageable with careful dosages. 

I had a friend who had it help enormously for ADHD, but unfortunately she had to stop thanks to a rare side effect."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I felt like a tuning fork that got hit struck plus extra warm for days after taking it I just felt like I was vibrating.¬†
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I worked wonderfully beyond the serious anger issues and the ""dumbs"" that come along with an anti cholinergic.

I had 2600 testosterone once with DHT that was 2x higher than what one would get from the equivalent injectable TRT dose. That aggression was nothing close to what 150 mg of bupropion produced.."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I've been on Wellbutrin for years, just started Strattera. I've been asking my doctor to take me off Wellbutrin, as I didn't think it does anything for me."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Wellbutrin made me feel legitimately dead, food tasted awful, and I couldn‚Äôt think."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Full dicsclosure: I have never taken stimulant medication for my ADHD because by the time it was recognized that had a doctor who was very against stimulant use in adults, which I accepted. ¬†So I cannot compare.¬†

Anyway I went through a really awful bout of depression in 2021 and doctor started me on Wellbutrin. ¬†Six months later, not only had my depression improved, but my procrastination and the associated anxiety had greatly improved. ¬†I definitely need a quiet place feee from distraction to work and I still struggle with a lot of things, but it did help.¬†"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Absolutely hated it. The brain fog and anxiety were intense.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Had a terrible reaction to it. Anxious, self-harming thoughts, on edge, stopped it immediately."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I‚Äôm on a Wellbutrin / Concerta combo.  The Wellbutrin didn‚Äôt help with a lot of the executive function issues, but it‚Äôs a game changer for impulse control!"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I had mania, rage and couldn't sleep on Wellbutrin.
(I don't have Bipolar Disorder)

I'm also on Strattera but I added Vyvanse to it."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I've been in Weebutrin, Adderall and Buspar for the last year, and it has changed my life. Wellbutrin can help you so much or make things worse potentially. Really depends in the person. I would recommend trying it though and starting at a low dose. It can take up to a couple months to really start working so don't give up on it. It can be a life changer. Best of luck."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Caveat: I have at least one liver enzyme deficiency that makes me a poor metabolizer of several drugs. While Wellbutrin isn't one of the drugs broken down by that particular enzyme,  I've never had a full pharmacological genetic test and I often experience side effects with psychiatric drugs.  Even when on Adderall, while it was very effective, possibly too effective, I would go days without sleeping. So I'm assuming I have many such deficiencies. 

That said: I initially thought Wellbutrin was helping me focus.   My thoughts weren't racing at night, so I was staying awake and focused during the day at a time when that was challenging.  But the overall effect seemed slight. Just enough that I kind of noticed something had changed.   And eventually I realized that while my thoughts weren't racing, they weren't doing much else either.   I felt completely dead inside.  It was pretty awful."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Did the Wellbutrin make anyone intensely horny?
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Gave me a slight high nothing else. Not worth it for me IMO.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Wellbutrin has been awesome for me. Tried Strattera before for several months, and recently realized it wasn't really helping me. I just started Lexapro which I'm a little annoyed about only bc my Dr is more focused on me being depressed than having ADHD, but so far so good"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"It helped me get shit done, but it made me incredibly irritable."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I tried it two different times, each a few years apart, each time for about 4 weeks.

I took 150mg extended release.

I felt kinda weird, amped up, hard to sleep at night. It seemed to make me feel extra anxious.

I kept a daily log, and observed a -0.49 (!!) correlation between the wellbutrin halflife and the degree to which I felt focused/happy/peaceful that day.

Yes, that was a significant NEGATIVE correlation."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Wellbutrin isn't really an adhd med. Its an antidepressant that acts like a stim and compliments adhd stims. 

I take it alomg side my vyvanse for depression issues.

When i first started I felt it helping pretty much immediately."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"About three weeks. 

Heh. I told my doctor to NEVER give me Wellbutrin again. 

Sure, it's like there's a librarian in my brain and I have instant recall and focus. 

BUT... It also puts me into something of a manic state. It  jacks my libido up to 11 and scraps all concerns about risky situations. 

Not a good scene. I mean. It was fun for a minute.... Buuut I got to a point where I realized I wasn't in control."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"i was taking it (150mg) for depression and attention (at the same time i was taking 75mg of venlafaxine) felt great everything seemed brighter and i felt the best i felt in a long time (i attribute that to the sheer amount of serotonin in my body not the wellbutrin) i could focus i read like 6 books in 2 weeks i couldn‚Äôt even tell you the last time i read more than 20 pages before that. i ended up going to 300mg because i felt like it wasn‚Äôt doing enough like that attention didn‚Äôt last long like it eventually diminished and then i was having serotonin syndrome symptoms (75mg of venlafaxine and 300mg of wellbutrin) eventually went off the venlafaxine and one withdrawal later i was on 300mg for a few weeks before lowering it to 15g and didn‚Äôt feel it was doing anything for my attention i still couldn‚Äôt focus or read or do anything for a sustained amount of time and got off of it end of july because it was causing side effects (had them the whole time but didn‚Äôt really notice bc of other serotonin symptoms)
 
TL;DR it didn‚Äôt really do anything for me except cause other health conditions"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,SSRIs were horrible. Then I tried Wellbutrin and had zero negative side effects. My baseline mood and appetite improved over the course of 2-3 months. I am taking WB and Vyvanse and feel night and day different from my depressive episode (which was likely related to ADHD burnout than depression)
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Anti-anxiolytic and anti-depressant medications will have an *extreme* variety of effects from individual to individual. Reading anecdotes *may* give you insights into possible side effects and experiences, but I would strongly suggest for drugs of these kinds to read the relevant medical literature so you can understand the most common outcome you may face. 

The benefit of Bupropion is that it is an Aminoketone, and is a more compatible AD drug with stimulants than a SSRI/SNRI so it‚Äôs a common cotherapy drug for us with ADHD and other mental health comorbidities. 

For me, it was the third pharmaceutical (first were two SSRIs) I trialed within a years time and the one I‚Äôm currently on besides a stimulant. Your physician will likely have you trial a lower dosage and observe the effects. This is the most safe route for you as an individual as sometimes these medications can exacerbate some issues, like anxiety.   

I currently take 150mg/d with a 30mg/d Vyvanse and have no issue. I don‚Äôt notice any positive effect towards my ADD but I do notice a reduction in irritability compared to my baseline. I don‚Äôt notice significant improvements in depressive symptoms, but it‚Äôs hard for me to gauge as I have another condition that interferes."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I had like 0 emotion or sex drive or interest
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I had a seizure on Wellbutrin! Not fun at all.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Garbage.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Me, its aight but can sometimes give me brain fog/irritability later in the day. I switched to Dex/Amph salts and feel much lighter."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Gave me blurry vision and made my scalp itch like crazy. I quit after a week and refuse to try it again. Didn't help with the ADHD either
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Done til 450mg daily. Pretty high dose. Useful first month, gave me energy and a little hope thinking about found the right medication but no, after a month it was like sugar pills.

I were in that phase of misdiagnosed general anxiety and major depressive disorder, then they lett me do the tests and I scored a severe ADHD-Pi. 

Under 40mg daily of methylphenidate it's ok, now I know why SSRI/NDRI/SNRI always doesn't have effects, except the first month when it kicks in."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Only time I've ever seriously felt like there was no hope in the world.  I had it for depression while ADHD medicated and let me tell you.  I felt absolutely nothing. The highs weren't highs but lows managed to get lower.  I felt trapped and foggy and bleak constantly.  My sister had the exact same reaction to it
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I take it but for my depression. It took 3-4 weeks to kick in iirc. It does nothing (or not enough to not need adhd meds) for my adhd but it‚Äôs super effective at keeping the shitty thought pattern loops in my head turned off. If I ever get ‚Äúoh, I‚Äôm better now‚Äù and stop taking it the shitty thought patterns start to crawl back in a week or so. I still need vyvance to be able to quit fucking around on reddit and do things."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Wellbutrin helped some things for me but it made me excessively excessively anxious all the time.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I am on buspirone and wellbutrin xl for anxiety and depression, and once I got diagnosed I added Vyvanse. Wellbutrin works well for me
Edit forgot my buspirone"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Love it. I‚Äôm at 300mg and feel focused and happy. Still a work in progress, but a lot better than before thank god. I was at 300mg and loved it. Stopped for some reason. Started back up at 150mg and did have to double up to 300mg to feel the effects.  I feel a difference. My husbands noticed a difference."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"It took a few adjustments, but Wellbutrin has worked very well for me."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I took it. It helped my depression some, didn't see too much difference with my ADHD personally...maybe a slight improvement. Had various side effects for the first month or so I started, but none were too severe and all went away except for excessive sweating. I went off of it after a year because of the sweating 

Wellbutrin can take over a month to work so I'd give it more time"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Ive been on Wellbutrin for years, it‚Äôs been my only constant between pain meds (that I‚Äôm off of) and now Strattera. Wellbutrin was like a light at the end of a tunnel for me. With the Strattera at the highest dose, Im pretty sure I‚Äôve kind of plateaued bc my motivation and energy are minuscule now, my impulse control is just gone. I think I‚Äôm one of the few that is gaining weight on Strattera and Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm taking to my doc this weekend about potentially trying a stim, but bc of old ‚Äúhabits‚Äù, they might say no. 
It seems most people on here, that I‚Äôve noticed, don‚Äôt like Strattera. Either it didn‚Äôt help or too many side effects. 
I read that Wellbutrin and Strattera can have bad side effects but of course your doc should discuss with you. 
Also, Bc stims are fast acting and Wellbutrin and Strattera aren‚Äôt (it took about a month, plus time off of pain meds, for me to notice a difference. 
This of course is just my opinion and my experience."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I had an expectionally bad experience with it. I was a lucky girl who landed herself in the (something like) 8% of people who gain weight excessively instead of the typical weight loss. I gained almost 60lbs in just over 3ish months, it was absolutely insane. I am 5'3 and 60lb goes a LOONG way on my frame. 

The night sweats were suuuuper bad, i had horribly vivid nightmares like you wouldnt believe, and absolutely nothing improved when it came to mental clarity because i was having to adjust to so many drastic changes and lack of sleep. And because of the weight gain i grew to be even more depressed because i went up 2 sizes and couldnt fit into my clothes anymore and just all-around felt horrible about myself. 

And i am STILL trying to lose that frigging weight. I have about 20lbs left to go before i'm back at the weight i was and it's been a year and a half since i stopped taking it. I also turned 30 the year i took it so whatever that medication did to slow down my metabolism; my metabolism never recovered. 
Absolutely hated it."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Fuck wellbutrin
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Before I was diagnosed with ADHD, the psych prescribed me Escitalopram (Lexapro) combined with Wellbutrin XL to help treat anxiety/depression

It helped with both of those things, but it didn't treat the underlying reason for the anxiety/depression which was the ADHD

I felt apathetic, and monotone with no zest for life, but also not anxious at all and I took some bold risks that my anxiety probably would have prevented had I not been on those medications. They weren't the best decisions but ce la vie.

So I would say proceed with caution. Also, those medications didn't help my concentration, sleep, or any of my other non-emotion-based ADHD symptoms."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Me - started in April. Game changer. Best decision I made in a long time.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Daily for a while now. It‚Äôs a life saver (literally) for me. Has helped with mood and motivation so much
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I take Wellbutrin in addition to Vyvanse. It‚Äôs helped a lot with the ruminating cyclical thought traps & short tempter that the Vyvanse triggered for me. I can actually drive the speed limit now. Or walk slowly through an airport without breaking a sweat! It‚Äôs been magical.¬†

I never took it by itself, so I can‚Äôt comment on its effects on my ADHD symptoms absent of a stim."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I notice it immediately but that‚Äôs because it works as a stimulant with me. Generally, they say 2 to 4 weeks."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"i did, it sucked, helped with nothing and i also ended up having a rare side effect where it almost made me go fucking blind, 0/10 do not recommend"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I'm on Wellbutrin since \~4 years ago. I couldn't really tell you how long it took for it to take effect, because it was very gradual. But a few months back I forgot about getting my prescription renewed and ran out for 2 weeks or so, and I definitely noticed that. I got really emotional and sort of depressed... so it is having an effect. For me, I think it mostly improves my mood, and doesn't really affect my ADHD symptoms so much."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I've been taking Wellbutrin for 18 months.

Background - I was diagnosed with ADHD when I complained about brain fog, tiredness etc and realized the other things like forgetfulness and lack of drive and concentration were symptoms.

I'm pretty healthy. Exercise regularly, eat well and have a consistent sleep pattern (largely thanks to my girlfriend), which really helped to limit/mask my symptoms. I've never really been depressed or had anxiety.

Anyway, I started taking Wellbutrin. After a couple of weeks, I started to get anxiety, which I've never experienced before. Completely overthinking things, difficulty breathing etc. this went away after a week. Since then I've noticed the Wellbutrin has limited the amount of foggy days I have. Instead of say 3/4 per week, I might have 1 per month. It's helped other areas somewhat but I still suffer from memory, sleep and concentration issues. I would say just not as bad. It's a slow burner but took a couple of months of daily use to notice.

I have Ritalin for the bad days but it's makes my ticks and fidgeting much worse and doesn't really help my productivity that much so I tend not to take it much."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Like a month. It was the best ADHD medication I had for a long time
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I am currently on Wellbutrin. The only thing it has done for me so far was give me anxiety the first few days and then... Nothing. I'm taking pills that have 0 effect on anything in my life. 

I'm currently in the talks to switch to something else."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I did. Worked alright but made me sweat profusely. Like sweat literally coming out of every single pore. It got so bad that I once almost fainted. Also the withdrawal effects where terrible. Made me unsteady on my legs and feeling agitated all the time. Is was on 300mg extended release.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"My oldest takes it, but not for ADHD. He takes it for depression and they were hoping it would also help with the ADHD‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt think it really does. He still takes a stimulant as well."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,My doctor keeps recommending it for my ADHD. I tried it once and it didn‚Äôt let me sleep. I got off of it because I can‚Äôt handle being sleep deprived.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I am on 300mg XR daily right now but had been thinking of upping it to 450 bc my depression and anxiety seem to be coming back but like in episodes rather than constant like before I started it. I went with Wellbutrin bc I couldn‚Äôt afford to gain any more weight and it seems like that is a side effect with every other antidepressant. I have been sweating like crazy but I just attributed it to my size and the fact that it‚Äôs so hot and humid the phrase ‚Äúair you can wear‚Äù is heard daily. I‚Äôm looking forward to our three and a half days of winter lol
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"This is not an answer to OP question but I do have one since I saw someone else mention it. I have a fast metabolism and I noticed that I can eat breakfast, take my adderall and then in about 30 mins my tummy feels so empty, I‚Äôm starving and feel like I haven‚Äôt ate anything at all. It almost seems like the adderall makes my metabolism faster?? Not sure if that is possible but I noticed it seems like it does. In about 40 mins to an hour I notice a veryyy slight difference from my adderall. Not a huge one, and could just be placebo since I know I took my meds. It doesn‚Äôt seem to last very long either which could be my metabolism. Im going to talk to my dr AGAIN at my next appt in a couple of weeks‚Äîbecause I really wanna see if a different medication helps me better vs just upping the dosage again. I don‚Äôt wanna get on too high of a dose of stims. Anyone else have a fast metabolism and does your adhd medication seem to either not work or only last for a very short time??"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Wellbutrin has done nothing great for me. I didn't feel any difference on the first dose  I was put on. It was slowly increased overtime but still never saw a difference, only heightened anxiety. They then increased my dose to the maximum amount (400mg? I think) and I had panic attacks about anything and everything, every single day."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Tried it and it made me tired. I took it at bedtime.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I‚Äôm on it because of my anxiety and Adderall for my add
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I'm on it now, started a few months ago having never been on any medication as an off label that my PCP was able to prescribe me herself until I finish scanning my childhood documentation so that she can refer me to a psychiatrist and try stimulants.

It's been 4 months and I still have the pile of documentation sitting on my desk halfway scanned, so I wouldn't really say it's completely helped my ADHD. But it's helped in other ways. My anxiety is much better and the depression that I was refusing to accept has greatly improved. Being in a better mood overall has helped with my emotional regulation and made me less snippy with my husband. And while not really a direct affect, having a pill that I need to wake up and take first thing in the morning has gotten me into more of a schedule (I work from home).

I still struggle with lethargy and motivation, which is where I've always needed the most help. So I still want to try stimulants, but I definitely recommend giving it a try if you're considering it! Especially if you also have issues with anxiety or depression, which tends to go hand in hand with ADHD."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I take Wellbutrin. It more so calms my anxiety and mellows me out which can help my focus but it definitely isn‚Äôt the cure all. It‚Äôs not like adderall where you take it and your brain gets shit done. You take it and it helps with some distractions by giving a calming effect and then you really have to try hard to start a task and focus. There are days where I feel it doesn‚Äôt work at all and others when it does. Not sure why. But adding a stimulant to it helps the most.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Tried it, no effect. Like nothing at all, no side effects no drawbacks, no benefits, nothing"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Horrible
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I‚Äôm here at 3 am because it‚Äôs been giving me insomnia.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Wow that hadn‚Äôt been experience with Wellbutrin.  It helps with the overwhelm for me.  I can‚Äôt take stims due to high blood pressure.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I took it two different times in life a few years each for severe ‚Äúdepression‚Äù before I was properly diagnosed with ADHD (hence the quotes). It was not a good experience. I take a 20mg XR Adderall now for the last 9 years and that does the trick most of the time. 

I also have had permanent tinnitus for the last 15 years, which is a Wellbutrin side effect and it has been negatively life changing and there‚Äôs little that can be done for it. Thank God I can distract myself most of the time so I can still function most of the time."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I took Wellbutrin for years for depression & to curb smoking. It had literally 0 effects on my adhd, but it was helpful for my depression. Eventually I stopped feeling any effect from it & changed medications."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"i started Wellbutrin after hitting a low point with executive dysfunction and depression. i took it and literally felt a difference within hours and was able to get up, be productive and was no longer weepy. nothing else about my routine changed and I'm too skeptical for placebo effect so I have to think it was just what I needed but that's my experience and I have a lot of major depression comorbidity."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I‚Äôve been taking it and honestly don‚Äôt feel anything
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I had some nasty side effects with Wellbutrin.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Worked well for me! I think it‚Äôs supposed to work faster than a ssri. Your psychiatrist would probably know. I don‚Äôt think it took more than 2-4 weeks for it to kick it for me.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I am currently. Not helping much.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I take Wellbutrin and Vyvanse üòÖ
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I took it. It worked a little too well. Wasn't able to cry. Didn't have any kind of feelings other than being ""happy,"" but it took about a month to work. I did end up going to college briefly while I was on it. Was able to focus. But I experienced side effects that I did not like. I would be driving and I'd go down a hill and it felt like my head was filling with air and I'd almost pass out."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I am on Adderall and Wellbutrin (300mg extended release) for ADHD.  It was a pretty immediate effect once I went from 150 to 300mg.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I didn‚Äôt notice any difference but it completely stopped my migraines.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"It threw me for a wild emotional dis regulation loop inclusive of night terrors, not fun."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I ended up on Wellbutrin on top of my Adderall.  

On both the days where I did/ did not take my Adderall, my Wellbutrin made me extremely shaky and that was the only effect I got from it. I was taken off of it shortly after getting on it. 

For some it‚Äôs great, but not for me ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Did not help with any symptoms, it gave me a small ""push"" but the adverse affects were overwhelming. Awful cramps in calfs and shoulders."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Bupropion worked well for me in the sense that it improved my mood and fatigue, but it was useless for everything else. After six months or so it was making me irritable and nervous all the time, even after I'd gone down to the minimum dose. 

By the way, they say bupropion can be stopped cold turkey with no withdrawal. This is not the case for everyone. I felt like shit for three weeks after stopping. Taper down if you can.

However, if I had no Concerta available or any other ADHD medication, yeah, I'd go back to bupropion. Better that than fatigue and depression."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I just quit it, I hate that crap,  numbed me to a zombie and would make me have anger spells"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I took it to quit smoking in 2007. I hated it, made me feel awful. Stole all of my creativity, made me languid and apathetic. After two weeks I had indeed quit smoking, but I also quit the Welbutrin cold turkey against the advice of my doctor. It was the single worst medication experience I've had."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I tried Wellbutrin and it gave me serotonin syndrome, doc thought it would be smart to mix fluoxetine and Wellbutrin to fix OCD symptoms caused by my methylphenidate. Gave me extreme anxiety and the psyche ward f"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"My primary care doctor prescribed it for my ADHD, but it didn‚Äôt help at all. I‚Äôm starting to wonder if this is a joke. I went to see a psychiatrist, and currently, I‚Äôm on 40 mg of Vyvanse once a day, which I‚Äôm not a fan of either. I have an appointment with her on September 3, and I plan to ask for a different medication."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I took 150 then 300 mg and found it did nothing for me. Was trying to use a non stimulant, but found it had no effect that I could tell, good or bad."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Wellbutrin was okay for me. I think it helped a little with my emotional regulation, but not a lot else. I was taking it when I thought I had depression vs ADHD 

My husband tried it for depression and it made him so anxious I was worried for his health. Like truly, I thought he was going to do something to hurt himself."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"On it now. Started it because of depression that was really dragging me down. Definitely felt a small difference about a month in, then my dosage was increased and effect has gotten better since then. I take it at 6a & 3p on weekdays, only 1/day on weekends (mostly because I don‚Äôt notice the dip as much when I‚Äôm not at work.) Stick with it for a while longer  and find a task you can use as a barometer, I used a game that frustrates me when unmedicated to gauge when & how well the W was working."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Currently taking 200mg SR. I like it. I feel like it helps!!
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I do not want to go down the stimulant route, so I'm on Wellbutrin.  My psych and I had to find the correct dosage and it's been a night and day difference."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I got started on Wellbutrin because my PCP thought my untreated ADHD was actually just college stress manifesting as depressive symptoms due to the cold weather, based on information that she had misheard from me. I told her I‚Äôve been struggling since I started college 2 years prior but she interpreted it as I started having issues that month.

While on the medication I felt‚Ä¶off. Like something about me was fundamentally different. I thought more negatively, lacked even more motivation than before, started slacking in my schoolwork work more, isolated myself in a ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel like interacting with so and so‚Äù way. After about a month I stopped taking them all together and continued unmedicated life, feeling discouraged about being ignored by my PCP. In retrospect I started to describe it as ‚Äúthe antidepressants made me depressed‚Äù but it wasn‚Äôt depression per se, I just wasn‚Äôt myself. Back in November I finally reached out to an ADHD specialist who started me on Strattera which had no effect and finally put on Ritalin, which is helping immensely now."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"It took me the full 6-8 weeks to feel Wellbutrin but it‚Äôs been helpful I think. I‚Äôve been on it for a few years now. It didn‚Äôt help with my ADHD so much, but it was a good start."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I only taken it to help cessate amoking, and it works like a miracle drug for that!"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Wellbutrin was awful, for me. If I was mildly offended while on it, it could put me into a state of complete lethargy for hours. And I went from about 135 lbs to 115 in the span of a month and a half because I was just never hungry while I was on it.

Also, I always felt high while I was on it."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,It had an effect almost instantly. It felt awesome for about a week. Then I noticed things started to skip like music on a walkman. I wouldn't be able to think. My mind would just...stop. I would lose my  place in thought or conversation. I remember when I stopped taking the pills. I was doing a simple calculation for work and it was like the computer in my brain just shut off. Someone pulled the plug. I couldn't think. I didn't know what I was doing. I just kinda froze. Just stuck looking at what was in front of me. I came to a minute or so later after someone asked if I was ok. Never again took a pill or anything. I grew up 'coping' which I just call good habits. I'm gonna die with my good habits. Miss me with that big pharma malarkey.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I take Wellbutrin in addition to Concerta. I'm on a dose of 450mg/day that I split between morning and afternoon. I don't know exactly how much the Wellbutrin helps, but some days I feel like I don't even have ADHD. I technically take Wellbutrin for depression though."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Barely did anything for my ADHD compared to stima but I DID stop drinking booze on it. Also made me feel less sad.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"HATE wellbutrin... other than it gave me the ""sweats"" big-time (night sweats/changing clothing at least once a night and sleeping on a towel. And huge pit-sweats throughout the day). It eventually changes my core behavior/personality that I'm no longer ""me"".
Also, it killed my erections but not my libido... so disheartening.
I will never take wellbutrin again."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Honestly couldn‚Äôt tell you how long it took to work because I didn‚Äôt stay on it long enough. The side effects were brutal. Nearly passed out in the middle of Target and I have no history of randomly passing out.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I‚Äôm currently on Wellbutrin but it‚Äôs used for anxiety and my depression. I like it, it‚Äôs supposed to help with libido for those that have a problem with that on normal antidepressants like SSRI‚Äôs. It doesn‚Äôt help mine. I don‚Äôt think it helps with my ADHD as much as I feel it should. I‚Äôm on a the XR version of it."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I take Wellbutrin 450mg. I have ADHD, BPD, depression, anxiety and the Wellbutrin has worked for me but I‚Äôm not really sure it‚Äôs helped ADHD wise. I also take adderall among other meds. I started Wellbutrin at a time in my life where I was suicidal and self harming, the Wellbutrin helped stop the self harming but didn‚Äôt make the thoughts go away. Just the urge to self harm was less. I‚Äôve been on it for 10 years I‚Äôd say. I believe I got on it before adderall, but I don‚Äôt remember if it really helped the ADHD at that time since it was so long ago. I see a lot of negative reviews of Wellbutrin on here so I wanted to throw in a review that was positive, but it may be for reasons other than ADHD that it‚Äôs helped me."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I tried Wellbutrin when I was 21, and I'm now 37. 
I felt like a high at first from it and all happy but it didn't last and made me feel slow and weird. 
The best med for adhd for me is Concerta."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I‚Äôve been on Wellbutrin a few years. I tried Straterra, but it landed me in the hospital with elevated heart rate (120 resting, it was terrifying). So I had to stop it. My doc won‚Äôt prescribe stimulants and I‚Äôm tentatively looking into family planning. If and when I have a baby, after that I‚Äôm finding a new doc to try a stimulant. Wellbutrin is okay, I can‚Äôt say much bad about it, but my symptoms could be better managed. I feel it helps with energy and focus just a bit; better than nothing.  I don‚Äôt have a stimulant to compare it to."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Did absolutely nothing.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Yes. I felt better the first week but I think my body adjusted to the dosage so I stopped. I also stopped taking it because of the symptoms that came with it.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I did.  It didn‚Äôt help my adhd at all, and it gave me tremors (which thankfully resolved when I quit)."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I briefly tried Wellbutrin as a supplemental med for depression about 15 years ago. 150mg didn't have much effect and the first day we went up to 300mg, I had the first and so far only seizure of my life, which isn't a common Wellbutrin side effect but apparently not a completely unknown one either. Obviously, I never took it again."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I took Wellbutrin and it really helped my depression and some of my adhd symptoms. I feel like I can see an impact on my symptoms in a few weeks. If you‚Äôre not noticing anything after 4 wks I would reach out to your dr. They may have started you at a dose below the therapeutic threshold to reduce the impact of any side effects and increase you gradually to the therapeutic dosage.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I'm on Wellbutrin works good for depression not so much ADHD
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Wellbutrin helped me a lot, but not nearly as effective as a stimulant.  For me, the effects were immediate but decreased overtime.  Now I take wellbutrin in addition to my adderall... I do feel like it helps me with my mood and overall decreases the amount of adderall I need to take, it definitely wasn't enough on its own though."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I take Wellbutrin for years now but it‚Äôs not for adhd. It‚Äôs for my major depressive disorder. I take Ritalin now for adhd
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Rrrawwwrr
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Wellbutrin is very tricky and it should come with a lot more medication counseling and guidance. 

It lowers your tolerance for substances. It can, anyway. I was able to drink 15-20 beers a night while on it and I‚Äôm a 2-4 drink drunk and done usually.  I almost turned into a raging alcoholic bc I got in the habit of a night drink to calm back down after a day in the life and then I would drink and drink and drink and then got very addicted to that and had to really work at quitting. It was wild. Lucky for me I was able to quit. 
The ironic thing is it is also used to help people stop smoking too‚Ä¶ 

It also had very intense suicide effects.  

It shouldn‚Äôt take a while to start working though. Should be very quick from starting. It isn‚Äôt like other medicines that may need time to build up."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I took it but not for ADHD. It made my anxiety too bad. It helped with my seasonal depression but the bad outweighs the good.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I have been finding it to be the answer I've needed (so far). Can't do stimulants. SSRI's weren't the answer for me. So I asked to try an NDRI (Wellbutrin) and I went from being on 4 different things to only being on Wellbutrin. I am more patient, I have more motivation to do things. It's made such a positive impact on my life."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Wellburtin helped me focus and kept me on task. Unfortunately I started getting eye pain so I had to stop. I tried going back on it and same. It's really tok bad because I liked feeling so focused and on task
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"On it currently, absolutely love it. No drug will ever be perfect, gotta test it out first. I noticed changes immediately. 2 months in and life is already better"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"First time I took it, it gave me the tremors"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Wellbutrin made me an emotional mess.  I was only on it a few weeks before I said hell no.  I hadn't been diagnosed with ADHD yet so I was prescribed it for anxiety/depression.  EVERYTHING made me want to cry.  Sappy commercial? Sad song? Just cuz?  I was a mess.   I'm now on methylphenidate and while it hasn't been a massive difference it is definitely helping.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Tried it for mild depression and ADHD. Did nothing for ADHD, and I gained 15 pounds. It did help my mood but experienced initmacy issues. Overall a negative situation for me. I'm on Dexedrine now, works for me."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"It put me and my significant other in psychosis states. We were both prescribed Wellbutrin by our doctors after significant trauma on top of being adhd. 

Never again. Some people love it. I personally have not met a single person that had a good experience with other after a few months"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I was on Wellbutrin for about 2 months and it did absolutely NOTHING for me! Switched to Straterra and it‚Äôs improved some, only after increasing the dosage tho."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I take Wellbutrin + Vyvanse, and so far this is the best combination I ever had, it makes me really really happy and I‚Äôm actually able to enjoy life without suffering from the side effects

The effects started after a week I believe, I wouldn‚Äôt doubt that was placebo, but so far I‚Äôve been in Wellbutrin for +6 months"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Wellbutrin helps my depression immensely. Taking it regularly also helps my concentration and reduces my brain fog. It stabilizes my moods and reduces how extreme my lows and highs are when they come around. I will say it doesn't help me so much with getting things done or that procrastination paralysis but it helps me to function day to day with the little things
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"yeah it sucks ass, it's just another placebo. my doctor took me off of Adderall to try Wellbutrin and it didn't do shit and now it has been impossible for me to get my Adderall prescription back. Doctors and psychs are radicalized against ADHD and stimulants in their circles and keep doing this to people. I'm convinced Wellbutrin specifically is giving them kickbacks or something because they are trying to prescribe it for everything, not just ADHD."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I found Wellbutrin to be helpful for a brief period then like most everything else that plateaued. I found working with a therapist in cognitive behavioral therapy to be much more helpful than replacing Adderall with something else. I hope you don‚Äôt get offended by this because my intention is to be honest and to express concerns for your best interest as a person. I have been off Adderall for a year and a half now because of the shortages and will never be dependent on a drug again. It seemed I would never be able to fully count on supplies being consistent anymore and I had debilitating withdrawal for weeks. I chose to make the really difficult choice to cut myself off from medication dependency and to work on myself a lot to make up for the lack of meds. It‚Äôs been hard and I have my days but having a strong support system and folks at work being aware I have adhd and what my triggers and needs are to be successful has been life changing. I worry about the fact that we all think we need to compensate for our adhd by medicating ourselves into zombies that comply with ‚Äúacceptable culture‚Äù. I worry that we are all just deeply addicted to meds because people aren‚Äôt willing to accept us as we are and listen to everyone who judges us and treats us as less than. You are not too much even if you struggle, you are special and deserve to be fully yourself. I know it‚Äôs harder without meds but tbh everything is much easier when you‚Äôre on speed. I truly hope you do not take this offensively. I‚Äôm just sick personally of having to worry about my long term health by feeling I have to be living a life of constantly being on heavy pharmaceuticals."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I‚Äôve been taking Wellbutrin as an antidepressant since 2019. It did nothing for my ADHD. Gotta have stims.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I‚Äôve been in it for a few years and it works well for me. Definitely takes the edge off of depression.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Wellbutrin sucks but it‚Äôs not technically a stimulant nor controlled substance but word for the wise bupropion aka Wellbutrin can actually have an upper type effect which is why it‚Äôs often used before heavy drugs like stimulants. I would have to say that overall it‚Äôs a shitty medication with just as many side effects as stimulants without the benefits of stimulants. Not to temp anyone I don‚Äôt suggest this but I feel that the truth about meds dangers are important. I learned this while incarcerated for a short time about 15yrs ago and I already knew the abuse potential but the doctor told me they don‚Äôt typically allow Wellbutrin use in prison because if taken a certain way it‚Äôs extremely similar to effects of cocaine. Please I‚Äôm begging anyone feeling stupid to NOT test this theory because I can provide the answer and truth.

Many people abused Wellbutrin in places that had nothing much to offer and yes it does have a very strong effect similar. That said NEVER do it because the dangers are immense I‚Äôm talking seizures were normal and a cold compared to what damage it can cause if in the wrong hands so I‚Äôm hoping that everyone here is an adult and not a convict who has to get high for any purpose"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I started on 150 mg and after a few weeks I felt like my soul and my body were not moving at the same time (imagine the drunk people in movies and cartoons) and food was actually gross to me. 

I already forgot to eat regularly so it didn't help that I didn't have a taste for food either. I'd get to 9 pm and had not had any food and barely any water and my family and friends would have to remind me multiple times to eat. So I stopped taking it for a while and now I am back to taking it very inconsistently.

I might take it 3 times a week and I know it's helping a little but I need to talk to my doctor about a different med. I have an irregular heart beat and high blood pressure so she didn't want to put me on a stimulant. Time to explore the other non stimulant options!"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"No motivation, felt bad about myself was useless on Wellbutrin."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I got put on Wellbutrin for depression.  Ended up completely emotionally dysregulated, anxiety through the roof, couldn't handle anything at all.  It was awful."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I take Qelbree - only med that has worked - My insurance company made me go off of it and try strattera due to the price but 5 months later I was able to go back on it.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,it helped me with anxious eating but that was about it. I was quite brain foggy and forgetful it was really bad. I‚Äôm off it now and I take vyvanse and atomoxetine which has been perfect for me.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I was on it for a bit while in a very depressive episode, it took about 2 weeks to help."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I was on it a while ago for depression and stopped bc it was increasing anxiety. I thought it may be different this time but I think the anxiety is coming back so likely will go another route. It's tough, though, bc my psychiatrist cannot prescribe controlled substances so I have limited options"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Nice to hear I‚Äôm not the only one, I hated it"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Hated it! Made me feel super anxious, depressed and lost. I'm just started atomoxetine.if this doesn't work I'm pushing for Adderall"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I keep debating on getting off Wellbutrin. I could never really tell whether it made a difference for me, even after upping the dosage. I got off Lexapro right before I started it, which made me incredibly apathetic (almost got fired). So compared to that, Wellbutrin felt like an improvement but I think that was largely from just getting off Lexapro.

The past several months the brain fog and apathy has been particularly bad though.

my diet/sleep/water/exercise intake has been kinda crap so I‚Äôve been chalking it up to a combination of things. But Ive been trying to fix those areas and not noticing much of a difference.

Stims used to make a big difference for brain fog/apathy (even with shitty lifestyle habits), but they haven‚Äôt had nearly the same effect anymore. 

I‚Äôm a complete mess when I don‚Äôt take those though. Frustrating trying to find something consistent long term."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Loved it! Added 150, then 300 to my 20mg Lexie. Was able to finally figure out that depressxiety was  a symptom of my adhd. Now (after trials I won‚Äôt bore you with) I‚Äôve added 30mg vyvanse. Going to taper the Wellbutrin soon, probably eventually eliminate it. But Lexapro is my next most vital essential under food and water, and I will always shout out Wellbutrin for helping me find me again."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Partner had similar bad effects with Wellbutrin. Lethargic, all kinds of digestion stuff, nausea, and it really did nothing to mood. I saw no upsides to it, but obviously different brains are different, so YMMV. When we first got it we both did tons of research to see what to expect, and even after 2 months, nothing better, all worse."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Well, crap! I have been taking it for decades and suffer with all those symptoms and then some so now you got me wondering!!! :-("
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I lost hair while taking it. Not to mention the pills smelled absolutely horrendous.n
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"It made me anxious af and like‚Ä¶ hopeless, I guess? Like I just thought the future didn‚Äôt matter and I may as well give up. Scared the crap outta me. Wellbutrin was not helpful for me."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I‚Äôm on Wellbutrin and Strattera because my doctor can‚Äôt prescribe stimulants, but I‚Äôm definitely doing better on them than no medication"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Same. It zombified me.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I had that effect from Wellbutrin.  I also have that effect from methylphenidate but even worse. They work very similarly so maybe I should talk to my doctor about trying something else.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Same here. Demanded I was put on a different medication because of how dim my life became while on Wellbutrin.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"How long did you try? It took me six heavy months to get past the fog and feel the benefits, and now I don‚Äôt want to go back to classic stimulants."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Same here. And I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm the only person I have run into that actually gained weight on it instead of losing it like most people I‚Äôve seen report.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I was on Wellbutrin for a bit and it made my anxiety really bad. I was hopeful it would help but it was rough
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"What was your experience getting prescribed something else after the Wellbutrin? I was recently diagnosed and prescribed Wellbutrin and similarly had a terrible experience. Same issues with the brain fog, apathy and I quit taking it quite quickly (with OK from doc) because I was having huge memory lapses (forgetting whether I took my dog out, not remember texts I'd sent, etc.). Did they prescribe a stimulant right away after or did they try other off-label medications?"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,So the brain fog isn‚Äôt what an improvement is suppose to be‚Ä¶ i have some reevaluating to do
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Why do they want to stop what's working? Just curious. Seems like that would not be in your best interest.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"> Right now my doc wants to try and ween me off wellbutrin over time so I can function without it.

Does he have a reason, or just ‚Äúbecause‚Äù? 

With your family history, I‚Äôd be worried about persistent major depressive disorder, and new depressive episodes can be sneaky. I have a similar medical profile (comorbid depression, not depression as symptom) and my going off ended with needing other people to make doctor‚Äôs appointments to get me back on because my head was so fucked I literally couldn‚Äôt think straight enough to do it myself."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I initially started Wellbutrin for seasonal depression but it works really synergistically with my stimulant medications so I never went off it like I initially intended. I don‚Äôt mind though, I also ended up really liking it and haven‚Äôt noticed any major side effects. Though the stimulant combinations have started making my appetite a bit of a concern. It‚Äôs like my adhd isn‚Äôt fully managed so I can‚Äôt make myself cook or eat, but I‚Äôm on meds so I can‚Äôt rely on just my appetite. I think it‚Äôs a fixable issue though since my weight has been stable since March."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,What you share about your grandmother is so fascinating. I‚Äôve been into exploring genetics recently and your dad is totally spot on. Your parents can pass down mutations that cause the same ‚Äúbrand‚Äù of depression that can be traced back up the family tree.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Why would your doctor want to take you off it? Seems like an unneeded risk
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I have also noticed something similar. I am so confrontational, especially when driving lol does miracles for my depression though"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I was so mean on Wellbutrin! Unfortunately, it made me more depressed and uncharacteristically erratic. Eventually I found a good balance with Effexor for anxiety/depression and Adderall."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,When did the irritability start for you? Right away or were you taking it for a few weeks before you noticed it? I just started on it and really want to avoid this side effect.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I'm the same way with stimulants and straterra. I'm currently on low dose Wellbutrin and Qelbree. They're the only meds I've found effective so far.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Typical stimulants trigger my bipolar ü´§
I‚Äôm on generic Wellbutrin and Lamotrigine and they a good job handling both, if not being quite as effective."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Buproprion XL was amazing for my ADHD! It also relieved the grogginess and sexual side effects of the Lexapro I also take. I have never experienced *quiet* in my brain before!
... but ... It caused a scary serious level of constipation (it can slow gut movement). I switched to the SR version (morning only) and it's spiked my anxiety as well as completely killed my appetite and ability to sleep. Hoping cutting it down to 75 instead of 150 will solve that, but I feel like nothing will compare to the relief I had on XL."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"If they didn‚Äôt tell you, it is a smoking aid lol. Totally kills your desire for nicotine which I didn‚Äôt realize either until I was like ‚Äúdamn I haven‚Äôt had a smoke in two weeks‚Äù"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"This is what I was thinking, why take two SNRI's? Straterra made me feel bizarre. Worked like 20% for a week or so before descending me into a weird zombified state where I kept forgetting to eat"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I'm on Wellbutrin and all it's done is help me feel ""normal"". I still have ADHD and the other symptoms but I don't necessarily feel like an outcast anymore. Tried Straterra and it made me feel weird, paranoid like I was gonna just randomly die and also it gave me ED which was an issue with my relationship"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,im taking much lower doses than you. how did you know you needed to increase your dosage?
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"It's so interesting to me how everybody gets different interactions with these drugs. Bupropion has had pretty much the exact opposite effect on me, one of the biggest benefits I noticed was getting more pleasure from things. I am able to enjoy my hobbies again and focus on them without feeling guilty because it also helps make doing chores not so shitty, so I'm usually way way more caught up on things."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,In what way? What happened ?
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I take Qelbree and I have never been more anxious. Even when there is nothing triggering the anxiety, my body will react like there is and heart rate increases. I‚Äôve woke up out of a dead sleep with my heart rate being 150."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Do you also have autism? I also ruminate.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Yeah‚Ä¶ Wellbutrin is known for that. If you add in clonazepam and gabapentin, in the right combination, it not only offsets the Wellbutrin-related seizures, but that trifecta becomes a solid preventative for both seizures and migraines. FYI my seizures are the Absence kind, and my migraines are the Classic kind with the aura, blindspots, etc."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Yep, 300mg Wellbutrin gave me the first and only seizure of my life, which was scary as hell. Never took it again. I don't think it was doing anything for me anyway."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"OK, phew. After reading all of these, I was like, ""is it actually lobotimizing me?!"" But I'm more along the lines you described. If I miss a dose, I just start feeling disorganizedly depressed. I can see the spiral starting when I'm on it and can interrupt myself with those grounding techniques. Off of it, sure I have stronger emotions...but the bad ones. I don't think the happy ones are happier when I've missed a dose because I'm too busy dealing with the bad ones. I can totally see someone who doesn't suffer PTSD or depression, using it only for its stimulant qualities, feeling complete apathy. 

I also take concerta for ADHD. Welbutrin alone was making it so I'd see tasks that had to get done, but I wouldn't do them. Concerta makes tasks less overwhelming once I start them."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Wellbutrin is not FDA-approved to treat anxiety, JFYI. Increased anxiety is actually a known side effect of Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs working for you, but coming from someone who was originally told it would help with anxiety and ended up going off after a few years because I finally realized how much worse it was making my anxiety, I wish I had known that from the beginning!"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Are you AFAB or AMAB? I've been having sweats, but chalked it up to being AFAB and of a certain age. But I didn't know this was a common Wellbutrin side effect, so I could be off my rocker."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I'm 13 days in and haven't felt any negative or positive effects yet either.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I'm about 4 days in, nothing new yet. I'm curious how this will go"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"""H part""?"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Fuck. I've been attributing the sweats to being a certain age and the lethargy to a heart condition, but now I'm wondering if I'm up in the night on all fronts?"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,First panic attack I ever had was while taking Wellbutrin and another non-stimulant. It made my anxiety so bad!
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"How did you find that out? They didn‚Äôt do a blood test for that in those 28 years? I told my PCP I was tired a few months back (turns out you SHOULDNT drink 2 beers a day, bad for your sleep üòÇ) and they immediately did a blood test for my thyroid. Nothing came up. My dad died when I was 10 but I remember growing up he had a huge scar across his neck. He had something wrong with his thyroid when he was younger. Since my mother has also passed, I couldn‚Äôt tell you what was wrong with his thyroid and I‚Äôve been suspicious of a thyroid issue in myself, but have no idea and the tests all come back fine so I guess it‚Äôs a non issue. So I guess I am asking because I‚Äôm wondering how you found out about the thyroid issue."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Wellbutrin dreams are sooo crazy and feel so real
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I also have really insane and disturbing dreams. Best way to describe them is ‚Äúincoherent.‚Äù I am on 450 mg of Wellbutrin. I wake up in the morning and I can remember my dream so vividly but then when I go to tell someone, it just makes no sense at all. Like it made sense to me when I was dreaming, and it felt so real. But I always wonder why they feel so real when they are so fucking ‚Ä¶ weird? And not normal? And there‚Äôs nothing normal actually happening? Like nothing stands out to me when I am sleeping that ‚Äúthis could be a dream‚Äù I just wake up in a cold sweat after dreaming the whole night and feel like I just lived another life in my sleep."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Yes but the effects of the shortage depends on the state,In Maryland It wouldn‚Äôt take more than 1-2 weeks(sometimes hours later) while here in ny yea forget about it"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Did you find that it helped lower your anxiety when you were taken off of it?
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Same
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"That‚Äôs the combo that I'm on!! (Well, plus Prozac)"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,it's a real thing re metabolizing meds--some people are faster/slower than others so def talk to your doctor! I'm a slow metabolizer (yay for so many reasons lol /s) and only discovered this because of my experience with IR versus ER.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I‚Äôve read similar things on here. This happened to me as well. Not as severe but it would happen randomly. Happened during a job interview once and i‚Äôm sure it fucked up what was probably the best job opportunity i ever had.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Also it can increase anxiety terribly for ocd/adhd mix
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Too*
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"The way i described it was that it made me feel docile, like a sheep"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I loved it but strattera fucked me up real bad
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I've also had a horrible time on wellbutrin but, I think some of my side effects didn't come until later, so I thought I was ok, although it wasn't really helping."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I literally sat the remaining packs I had on fire once I stopped it cuz of how much I hated it
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Wellbutrin made me feel anxious, too. Like a deep sense of doom all the time, which was different than my ‚Äúnormal‚Äù anxiety. After Wellbutrin, I took atomoxatine (Strattera). It worked well for 7 months but the side effects finally got to me and I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. Then I took adderall and it‚Äôs been wonderful! Once starting adderall makes me realize the Strattera worked but only mildly but it felt stronger at the time because I didn‚Äôt have anything to compare it to."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,On Atomoxetine for about seven months. It‚Äôs made all the difference in helping me be a normal person.  Stimulants made me really sleepy. No problems so far getting prescription in stock.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Push for Adderall my friend. So worth it.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I tried Atomoxetine as a non-stimulant alternative to Adderall. Unfortunately it made me stop pooping üòÜ
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I'm on atomoxerine and Wellbutrin together.  Apparently it is supposed to increase the effectiveness by combining the two.   I've been on it for 3 months. It has had some affect but nothing amazing.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Any time I have taken medicines in the same class as Wellbutrin/ Lexapro. I have had these same effects. All of them eventually just make everything worse and I feel like the stimulants are ineffective. 

My doctor finally switched me to Buspirone and it‚Äôs actually helped.

Edit: used the wrong generic name"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Live laugh Lexapro.

The combo makes me sleepy but we're gonna try generic Vyvanse soon. I'm hoping it helps more."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Wellbutrin is a big help for me too same like yours. I was started with it and made me realize for the first in my life of how restless I was apparently and it soothed everything making me feel how more normal people are  I guess. 
It was the 150 then I was given a choice if I‚Äôd need to move forward with adderall XL for me which I did and then changed to vyvanse. I had to request if I could have wellbutrin again because it was more sustainable and I like how mellow it was for me. I still use vyvanse as needed and both worked great for me. 
The right concoction for me."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Same! I‚Äôm now on adderrall and that‚Äôs been way better
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I‚Äôm glad the combo is working for you. It does seem to work for some just fine.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I know we went through at least 6 months since I had to do 3 month appointments and kept asking for an increase but after the 2nd or 3rd visit I said it wasn‚Äôt working. 

My anxiety got better on stimulants which kind of confirmed my suspicions."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Oh yes I seriously gained weight on it. Still fighting to course correct.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"We had discussed that my major caffeine intake was likely self medicating a stimulant prior to Wellbutrin. So when he suggested trying a higher dose of Wellbutrin I just said I am going to be honest and I‚Äôll likely just end up taking an even unhealthier dose of caffeine to self medicate in response to the side effects getting worse. 

The doctor conceded to try Adderall on a very low dose for 1 month and go from there."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Yeah that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking. There were definitely times I struggled with the road of medication and I had pretty serious arguments with my doc where I wanted to get off of medication and he thought it was a bad idea. Short term and long term goals of being med free. But I‚Äôm glad I listened to him and stayed on them.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Worst idea I‚Äôve ever had. I took myself off my meds last year and by February I was in the hospital having a having a panic attack after not sleeping for 5 days. Thought I was having a heart attack. Being off meds was okay until I had some major stressors.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,oh dude I've been having the same problem! I live off protien shakes and bars rn. it sucks.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"yup and bipolar 2 is very dominant on the male side of the family as well it is very interesting 

my grandfather, my dad, my bro and my cousin have bipolar 2"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Definitely agree. It fixed my depression but made me actual ""hell on wheels."" Irritable doesn't even begin cover it."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,The weirdest thing was‚Ä¶ just waking up and my first thought of the day would be something akin to ‚Äúhow can I make their day worse‚Äù. Like who thinks like that üòÇ
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"It‚Äôs hard to say because it was subtle. It happened gradually I think, eventually coming to a head when someone called me out for being a dick. I realized that I‚Äôd be waking up in the morning, just thinking about being an asshole. It‚Äôs the weirdest thing. Hard to explain, because like, who does that üòÇ
So to answer your question the best way I can, I‚Äôd say a few months before I noticed it being an actual problem. Then again, I didn‚Äôt think it WAS a problem until others said so. Then, thinking back to it I‚Äôm like wtf was I doing."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I actually had it prescribed specifically for that purpose and was still amazed at how well it did the job. I had tried it for ADHD a few years prior, which was before my relapse back into nicotine."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"That‚Äôs weird, cus I‚Äôve been taking 300mg a day for the past couple months and I‚Äôm still addicted with no luck :/"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I wonder if anyone here knows why they would prescribe two SNRIs at the same time. A friend recently told me they are on this combo of Staterra and Wellbutrin and I was confused by why a doc would do this. It's not working well for thier ADHD symptoms.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Straterra gave me really bad depression and brain fog. I really haven‚Äôt had much luck with SNRIs
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I was in constant talks with my virtual doctor all the time. It all started to come to light when I had a severe burnout from work and everything. 

We kept trying all kinds of different meds for at that time anxiety/stress. Finally landed on Wellbutrin and gradually increased it, but they also wanted me on something else to get max potential. A few others later and all of them caused me to have side effects, except Wellbutrin. I finally said I can't do anymore of this trying other meds because I wasn't feeling the full thing. I explained I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was young but then was taken off the meds. So I said what if it's coming back with a vengeance. Now I'm on Vyvanse and Wellbutrin, and I am in a much better spot now"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"It is fascinating! I feel like I should specify a bit more. I did get more stuff done for sure and that felt great. The example I give often here is the first day on the medication. I hadn't read a full book in years and years. That day, I simply thought ""I really wanna read that one book"", I just got up, grabbed the book and read it from beginning to end in one sitting. It felt amazing. My mind was just so clear and focused. Think I read four books in the first week or two of the medication. Sadly, the focusing and mind quieting effect tapered off quite fast. Maxing out the dose happened a few weeks into starting it, which did give another boost, but it wasn't nearly as significant as the original dose had been and it kept rapidly tapering off.  
  
When I say ""dampening of feelings, getting less pleasure from things"", I mean the highs were not as high and the lows weren't as low as I'm used to. It was like the medication put on a limiter on my feelings. There were more positive feelings overall due to there being less of a gap between thinking of doing something and actually acting on it, which was very nice. As the positive effects got less and less, what remained was the dampening effect. That's when I really started to notice it more. Especially as I was in full swing of starting therapy. It was my therapist who recommended me try to see if dropping the medication  would help with getting access to my emotions better, and it did have a massive effect on that.

Thankfully getting off the medication wasn't that bad at all and as I did that, the dampening effect went away pretty fast as well."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Extreme depression. Worst I‚Äôve ever felt. Wanted to kill myself. 

Also worth mentioning, though, they took me off Lexapro really quickly a couple of weeks beforehand instead of tapering me off properly. And I think that played a big part of what happened to me."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Rumination isn‚Äôt exclusive to autism
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Not that im aware of
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Whoa I did not know that about the trifecta being used to treat seizures or migraines! I have classic migraines too with the nasty aura and blindspots (even talking about it makes me feel like puking it's so disorienting). I don't have seizures though.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I was only taking 150mg but I had been taking it for several months so I possibly took 2 at times‚Ä¶ I did that sometimes especially if I missed a day‚Ä¶ 

Do you take anything in replacement?"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Shit. Maybe my psychiatrist prescribed it for depression? I have dysthymia as well as GAD. It‚Äôs not my only med, though, and I‚Äôve stopped using Xanax altogether with my current regimen. None of it helped with ADHD, though. ü•¥"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Unsolicited hormone advise, but you should ask to have your levels checked at your next appointment. Mine were post menopause level at age 43. I should have started hormone replacement long ago (for bone and heart health). In perimenopause, my doctor didn't believe that I was in perimenopause. He only tested when I told him my periods had stopped for a year because he thought I was lying to him. Then, he didn't prescribe them because I ""didnt need them"" while sweating through all of my clothes and sheets every night. Going to an obgyn with NAMS certification has been life-changing. A drop in hormones will absolutely destroy someone with ADHD."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I'm MAB, and noticed the sweats come on after 2 weeks. apparently it's not just wellbutrin but a lot of antidepressants. for wellbutrin it's likes 25% of users get excessive sweats!"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Day 14 or 15 was the 'aha' moment for me.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,The H part of ADHD
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"That type of stuff happens to me all the time. When I experience side effects I don‚Äôt always assume they are side effects right away. The only reason I didn‚Äôt fall into this with the sweating is that when I first started Wellbutrin, my girlfriend told me she used to take it as well, but stopped because it was causing her to sweat excessively. So the first time it happened I already knew what it was. Like I was sweating out of my kneecaps, which was unusual but if I wasn‚Äôt on the lookout for it i probably wouldn‚Äôt have thought twice about it. At least at first."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I am sweaty too from it but I use drysol, which you put on your pits (ONLY A SMALL AMOUNT BECAUSE IT WILL BE PAINFUL IF YOU OVERDO IT) and it literally makes you sweat WAY less or stops it altogether. You should ask your doctor about the sweating cause they can help."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I had one MAJOR panic attack 7 days after I started Wellbutrin, ON AN AIRPLANE. Thankfully, I was able to rationally understand what was happening to me, and found an adorable video of my youngest daughter lip-syncing in the back of the car that I used to bring myself back.¬†

It turned out, the ‚Äúdecaf‚Äù Carmel macchiato I had chugged while sprinting through the airport on hour 9 of an insane travel day was in fact, NOT decaf.¬†

I stuck with Wellbutrin, but cut out the afternoon coffees, and I haven‚Äôt had a single panic attack since.¬†"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Yes I was in my 50s before I ever had a blood test of my thyroid. Both parents ok thyroids I think. I was just a depressed chubby female. Nothing to worry about. Male doctors now that I think about it. I say that because I tried a couple times to get sterilized. Never ever wanted kids of my own. No one would sterilize a single woman.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Oh I‚Äôm living in Maryland rn too and read the rest of your comment. I didn‚Äôt see you were in ny. I was thinking ( wait I just picked up my script for adderall 3 days ago) but yeah. I remember in Maryland when the shortage was horrible where I couldn‚Äôt get my medication for almost a month.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I forgot to include my buspirone, this combo's been doing great for me, I am adjusting the Vyvanse up a bit, as I currently have a ton of things going on that require more executive function abilities, and I'm finding that I'm not keeping up at the level I was when things were a bit calmer."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,That is good to know! I‚Äôll definitely tell my dr at my appt next week! Thank you for sharing! I bet it‚Äôs a nice thing to metabolize meds slower vs faster. I have tried an ER version and it didn‚Äôt seem to last any longer than IR version meds so I think that shows I metabolize it quickly or that brand of ER wasn‚Äôt very good maybe?
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Same with strattera!
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I got nightsweats, woke up at night constantly.... and started seeing things on stattera. Thank God I have a dog, so I knew someone wasn't there....otherwise, he would have been barking and alert. Scary experience for me"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"am i wierd? i'm on wellbutrin, adderal, and bupersi- whatever its called, and i rarely feel anything at all."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,My adderall makes me very sleepy at times.  It‚Äôs actually been doing that a lot more recently‚Ä¶.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I would like to try atomoxetine again ‚Ä¶ but the first time around it made me so sleepy! This time I will try taking it at night - but I‚Äôve read it can also cause insomnia. Any advice? Do you take it morning or night?
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"On stratera, guanfacine + Wellbutrin. My secret sauce for managing adhd without using stimulants. Used to take adderall but got addicted and it was never enough. 3.5 years off it üòÉ 
No pill makes adhd symptoms totally go away. I‚Äôve had to lean on coaching, habits, etc to help me adult. Nice to not be a slave to stimulants anymore."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Damn Ive been stopped up no wonder!
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,[deleted]
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Wellbutrin/bupropion is a class unto itself. There are no cohorts. It's the only NDRI. 

Lexapro is a SSRI, the most commonly used type of antidepressant. 

So I'm confused. ""Same class, same effects, make everything worse, stimulants are ineffective."" I'm not debating or playing devil's advocate, just wondering how 2 polar opposite antidepressants have the same effects. 

Because I'm on wellbutrin and my Adderall is no longer working. ü§î"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Same! Generic, but much more helpful than bupropion"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,So you have seen hell... Happy you found something that works for you comrade.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Thanks. I'm also a heavy caffeine consumer, as well as nicotine. Been super hard to quit the latter because that's about all I feel like helps me keep it together. I think I'd respond well to a stimulant and really don't want to have to go through a whole saga with something like Wellbutrin again"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I probably would have ended up hospitalized, but it was a couple of months into covid and the medical system had no room for people who weren‚Äôt actively dying."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I miss the little buzz of smoking. But I don‚Äôt crave it or feel compelled to smoke. So I take that as a win
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"That‚Äôs wild because I am so far away from tobacco now. No cravings, even tried Zyn and it basically made me sick. I‚Äôm totally adverse to tobacco and nicotine now"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Wellbutrin isn‚Äôt an SNRI. NDRIs also target noroepinephrin but the mechanisms, side effects, and results are all different.

Strattera didn‚Äôt do anything for me either when I was already on Wellbutrin, but I think my doc just wanted me to try it because it‚Äôs like the ‚Äúlast resort‚Äù option for non-stimulant drugs if nothing else is working."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Let me know if you learn anything! I think the Wellbutrin/Strattera combo may be for people that doctors don't think should start stimulants, i.e those with addiction problems or heart issues.¬†"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Yeah can't help but think big pharma is pushing SNRIs on us like they pushed every other drug, in waves."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"It may well have, plus suicidal ideation is apparently very common with wellbutrin. So sorry this happened to you"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"I'm sorry to hear this! For me, it didn't feel like it was working at all until I started hallucinating. I remember one of them when I was sitting on the toilet looking at the towel on the bar moving like a gif- flowing as if it was water. I was like yeaaaa I'm not taking this anymore üíÄ 

I've been on Lexapro ever since for my anxiety/depression!"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"This was like 15 years ago and I was trying it for depression, because I hadn‚Äôt been diagnosed with ADHD at the time. But no, I don‚Äôt think we specifically replaced it with anything."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Every person‚Äôs body reacts differently to meds, so if it‚Äôs helping your anxiety, you‚Äôre good! I just like to warn people because I too have GAD and depression, and was originally prescribed Wellbutrin for ‚Äúboth‚Äù without being told that it could worsen my anxiety over time. And it took me sooooo long to understand that my anxiety was getting worse because of the medication, not because of my own brain. But again whatever works for you works for you! Nothing helped for ADHD for me either until adderall üôÉ"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,This is so good to know! Thank you.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Ah! Don't know why that didn't compute.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Damn. This thread is a gold mine.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Same here
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Oh gosh that is terrifying. It just made me deliriously tired all the time. I couldn't keep my eyes open at all. At night it did give me night terrors which I would only get super rarely before it.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,What is the third one? ¬†I take bupropion XL (wellbutrin) and adderall usually. ¬†It‚Äôs the combination with the least side effects for me.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Buspirone? The anxiety one?

How are you feeling about those as a mix?"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Do you have a really quick metabolism?
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Buspirone
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Omg I've never met anyone on this same combo! Welcome to the club. I'm currently on:  
- 20 mg Adderall XR, morning  
-20 mg Adderall IR, late afternoon/evening (but I forget to take it half the time)  
-300 mg Wellbutrin  
-30 mg Buspar  
\*\*In addition, I also take:  
-0.5 mg clonazepam, usually 5 days a week or so (I have a severe driving phobia after my brother had a car accident)  
-Metroprolol (not sure the dose, it's a tiny one - this was for anxiety as well as a first treatment a long while ago...I don't think it does anything but my doc keeps me on it so whatever)

Here's my thoughts: The best of all of these for my well-being personally is Adderall. The Adderall, when taken as I should, makes my life so much more manageable. I mean, it's not like WILDLY significant...but I can finish tasks. I can get something done. I can start something I may not necessarily find interesting or want to do. I can get to work or events a LITTLE bit more on time. I can engage with people for a little longer without feeling like I'm crawling out of my skin needing to interrupt them. So, when I'm not as much of a train wreck, it reduces my anxiety. It also helps with depression. So for me, I think that's the main helper.

Wellbutrin I've only been on for 6 months. It's...neutral. LIke almost all anti-depressants for me. I rarely get side effects from any meds and most don't work for me, no matter what they are. Prozac I took the longest at 60 mg and it was probably the only noticeable anti-depressant that kind of helped me just feel a bit more at peace I guess. But the sexual side effects of Prozac, while tolerable for a while, made it just not sustainable long term. It was too frustrating. Wellbutrin definitely doesn't have that effect. And it helps me cut down on my smoking as a bonus. But for depression...eh? I don't know. I guess it's not hurting anything. 

Buspar is a placebo drug I swear. lol. Jk, some people swear by it I guess. I wish I could. My friend takes it and it like makes him a new person. It's wild. It does nothing for me. I feel like Tylenol is more noticeable. I'm probably just going to stop taking it because I don't think I need it. If I do get severe anxiety/panic, clonazepam takes care of it. I know that's not an option for everyone, and people should be careful with it because it can be addictive and people build a tolerance to it. In my case, I've been on the same dose for 5 years. Never increased the dose, taken a full week off here and there, no side effects, no withdrawal, no dependency or cravings, but it's very helpful when it comes to things like driving and other situations that might cause panic like that. But I know that I'm probably the exception and I think my doctor knows that. I wouldn't recommend it unless you've tried everything else since so many people seem to react badly to it. I don't even feel it - I just don't feel that heavy anxiety/dread 24/7. 

Anyway...that's how those all work for me. Curious if anyone else is on this combination because it's definitely uncommon since technically some contraindict or whatever (CNS stimulant with CNS depressant), but...it's ok enough for me, though I'd probably function just fine on Adderall alone and the same low dose of clonazepam as needed or less if I could actually afford the therapy to work through the fears/trauma/etc."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Talk to your Dr, no reason to be taking all these meds if they're not helping. Though if you're new to the wellbutrin, it can take a month or so to show an impact.¬†"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I take it in the morning. No problems with sleepiness. The stimulants made me fall asleep. That why my psych tried Atomoxetine. I have zero side effects. Definitely my miracle drug.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,üíê congratulations
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"How did you find a good coach and develop those habits without completely losing your mind or going broke? Stimulant meds don't do anything for me and Strattera doesn't do much, so I don't have that option at all."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,What dosage are you on with all 3 meds?
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Curious on your dosages for all three of these as well. I was on Wellbutrin which was great for task initiation, turned me into the energizing bunny and I would tick one thing after another off of my to do list from morning until night. However, the kinds of tasks it helped with were house cleaning, yard work, grocery shopping, things where I was on the go. Any task where I had to sit still and focus, it either didn‚Äôt help or made it worse. It also gave me very bad anxiety and increased the number of thoughts bouncing around my brain at once. I‚Äôll usually open a web browser tab or a note in my iPhone when I think of something I want to follow up on later but there were just too many thoughts and they came and went so fast, too fast for me to be able to chase any of them down. I would just immediately forget what I was thinking about and not be able to get back to it.

I weaned off the Wellbutrin and started strattera which I find to be helping decrease the number of thoughts in my head, decrease my overall anxiety, gives me the ability to focus on what people are saying so now I can have a normal conversation. Even if I do trail off during a conversation, when it happens when I‚Äôm speaking, I can make it back to what I was saying. When it happens when someone else is speaking, I realize it more quickly and can say I‚Äôm sorry I zoned out for a second, can you repeat that last part? It‚Äôs beginning to strip away what I thought was social anxiety but what was really just me being terrified of looking like an idiot when I‚Äôve finished a conversation and have no ideal what was said. The strattera is also helping with my binge eating. However the downside is that now I can‚Äôt find it in me to get started in cleaning my house, doing the yard work, etc. while the Wellbutrin turned me into an OCD clean freak. I literally started the strattera 25 days ago and every day I‚Äôm like, ok I‚Äôm going to clean the house today and then I don‚Äôt do it! It‚Äôs driving me nuts!

I was thinking that if I could somehow be on both the Wellbutrin and strattera but take something else to tone down the anxiety and racing thoughts from the Wellbutrin, this would be the perfect combo. What was your experience like?"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Whoa, this is amazing. My psychiatrist would not allow me to combine any meds at all."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,![gif](giphy|BA8Fly9RBEuIM)
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Whoops Buspirone
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Not sure and didn‚Äôt know it was a different class. Certainly all SSRI were terrible but Wellbutrin did give similar results.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Absolutely a win.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Actually lemme kinda walk that back a lil bit. Quitting tobacco was easy, and quitting vaping took a lil bit more effort. But even with the Wellbutrin I still can‚Äôt stop with zyns. The cravings are wild. This is the 3rd time in the past couple years that I went back to nicotine after quitting ‚Äúfor good‚Äù

Good for you though! It‚Äôs such an improvement on life in terms of not just like physical health but actually in helping some adhd symptoms and lowering anxiety. I hope my own symptoms will be more manageable once I‚Äôm able to quit again"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"Oh, that makes sense! Thanks for your answer."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Ok thank you!
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,I used to use the 2 and I am completely off of buspirone but it helped me through a very anxious time of my life.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,idk? i cant even tell if its active.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,i think i do.   any advice?
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"It's a struggle right? Everyone's like ""you'll need therapy/coaching"" but apparently the therapy doesn't do much if you're not medicated and it's ruinously expensive, I genuinely don't understand how people can afford like >$150 a week?"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,It‚Äôs expensive but I justify it. I‚Äôm in sales so if coaching helps me close a deal it pays for itself 10x. I just googled adhd coaching. I use it a lot for home life and my relationship too because my adhd can effect my partner a lot.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"100 mg atomoxetine hcl, 300mg bupropion xl, 4mg guanfacine hcl er.
It was a lot of trial and error for figuring out does and I started low, went higher, went down etc to figure out my sweet spot."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Wtfffff that‚Äôs so weird. Lol it‚Äôs crazy how the same circumstances and medication have such massive difference in outcomes.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"If you aren't seeing symptom improvement, you should talk to your doc."
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,No I don‚Äôt. I got a really slow metabolism so I need a very low dosage.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,"YEAH IT'S GREAT. I saw a therapist for quite a while but I finally gave up because she just...didn't Get It, like at one point she actually told me ""it all boils down to willpower"" when I'm sitting here with Didn't Get Any Willpower Disease. At least I have good insurance that pays for therapy, so I think potentially that would help if I could find somebody who Got It, probably someone who also has ADHD...if there are any therapists like that in my state, and there might not be. But insurance definitely doesn't pay for coaching, and there's basically no oversight for that at all, so that would be even more expensive for trying to find somebody whose methods work for me. 

And then, yeah, the thing I keep seeing is that therapy alone doesn't generally help unless/until you're medicated, so I'm just like. hahaha cool cool cool"
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,Thank you!
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,My therapist has ADHD and is the one who diagnosed me (my second therapist - diagnosed at 31). If you think therapy is needed you can look around ask if anyone has experience with ADHD patients specifically. She tells me to be patient will myself and let myself have days I do nothing if needed.
Who here has ever taken Wellbutrin?,5 minute guided morning meditation does wonders for my adhd brain. Habit stacking. Accountability partners or body doubling. Also diet and exercise makes a huge difference too. There‚Äôs an arsenal of tools to try and see what helps.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,[deleted]
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Sometimes antidepressants can help too, especially in the beginning diagnosis stages. I went to mine with focus issues; they described my symptoms as anxiety and gave me Zoloft. I wasn't satisfied with the answer but took the meds anyway because ""may as well try SOMETHING"". They did and didn't help at the same time so I was able to talk with my doc and proceed from there. ADHD can be hard to pinpoint because it can present itself in so many waysb which means varying ways of treatment. I've found great relief in a combo of Zoloft(an antidepressant) and Strattera(also an antidepressant) for myself. Taking antidepressants doesn't necessarily mean you feel depressed; they can help on other ways too"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Wellbutrin is also used for adhd.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,[deleted]
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Welbutrin has some pretty good results with adhd, even without depression. I'm on a welbutrin and ritalin combo. I could probably go on full welbutrin if it weren't for the side effects.

But meds are a very personal thing ofc."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"i'm adhd and on wellbutrin and it's wonderful and changed my life, so."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Welbutrin is often prescribed for ADHD.  I took it for 15 years bc it was the only med i tried that didnt feel like speed and i didnt fall apart if i forgot to take it for a day or two.  It can be helpful for a lot of other things too like mood stabalization and as a quit smoking aid (helped me kick the cigarette habit!).

That being said, maybe take the word of a trained professional over any advice you get from a reddit forum.  We‚Äôre just a bunch of normal people giving our dumbass opinions.  If you dont trust your doc, you should find a new doc."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Along with what people have said about Wellbutrin and it being used for ADHD, it's also worth noting that depression doesn't always involve wxplicit sadness, but can manifest as a lack of interest or joy in things. That's where it can kind of blur with ADHD. Keep the conversation going with your psychologist though, it's important that you walk through your concerns.

I hope the Wellbutrin works well for you. Do be mindful of your moods on it though. It had some pretty strong effects on my personality and interactions, though I did feel a lot more energy on it. It can also make you grind your teeth at night until your body gets used to it, so if you wake up with jaw pain you may want to get a mouth guard for sleeping."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Jump through the hoops. Try it out. They're just throwing easier meds at it first to eliminate them as an option.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,I‚Äôm on Wellbutrin and it‚Äôs been helping me with various issues including distraction. I think I‚Äôm still distracted fairly easily but I can jump back into tasks more easily and with less feelings of frustration.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Wellbutrin is special. It works for some people for ADHD. Not me tho, does nothing for my ADHD. Great for depression tho. Only one that doesn‚Äôt put me to sleep."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"As other people have stated, it's very possible you DO have depression. It's also possible you don't have ADHD. So many mental health symptoms overlap and what looks like one thing may be something else. The good news is you will be having follow ups with this doctor and if this course of treatment doesn't help, there's still hope. Maybe fill out an ADHD screening form and bring it to your next appointment. Voice your opinion that you're a bit skeptical about it being depression and maybe they can discuss with you their thought process. Another note- just because a medication is labelled as one thing (i.e. antidepressant) doesn't mean that's all its used for. As an example, in the past for anxiety/depression, I have been prescribed Rexulti and Abilify (both antipsychotics) and Lithium (used for bipolar disorder). A lot of meds often have multiple uses. Good luck üòä"

Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"There's a huge pressure on doctors to not prescribe stimulants and downers as these are the most addictive and abused medications. If you had high blood pressure you would probably not go in asking for a specific blood pressure medication, you would let the doctor do their job and advise you on what to try first based on their expertise and experience.

Definitely follow the doctor's lead. Wellbutrin can help ADHD, but Wellbutrin is also known as doing shit-all for a lot of people (including myself). Give it a fair chance, and if it doesn't help, then go back to the doctor. I would advise against insisting on one medication or the other, lest you be labelled a drug-seeker. Personally I had to try Wellbutrin, Ritalin and Concerta before they offered me Vyvanse, which based on my own research is what I wanted to try from the beginning. It's working well now."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Wellbutrin worked fantastically for my adhd when I took it to quit smoking. I had to come off it as I couldn't sleep, but those 3 weeks were the most productive of my life. Give it a try, less side effects than stimulants for the most part."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Stimulants are not an option for me because of cardiac history, so they started me on Wellbutrin. It helps so much with my executive function and ability to focus without hyper focusing. It took a while to get up to the best dose for me, but even at the lower doses it helped so much.

Maybe stimulant meds would work even better on my ADHD symptoms, but I don't want to die so I'm happy with this."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Wellbutrin is a norepinephrine and a dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Both those neurotransmitters are implicated in ADHD its just that Wellbutrin is only approved for use in depression. It can still work for other stuff off label. Straterra is used for adhd but its a norepi reuptake inhibitor too. 

Both Wellbutrin and Straterra are non stimulant options for it. They do take several months to fully build up though so give it a chance to get going before deciding against it"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,[removed]
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I definitely recommend giving this a chance. As long as you don‚Äôt feel worse, it might work for you. Like you said, it‚Äôs an off label treatment and like others have said, it‚Äôs less of a pain to have refilled. 

Adderall works for me, but I talked about alt options with my doctor. Not because I‚Äôm against taking it, but because there have been problems having it filled and also because international travel looks to be an issue. 

Keep a log of when you take it and how you feel. Any side effects whatsoever. This will be helpful to the doctor."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"They tried this on me too. First, I was on stimulants that worked beautifully. Then because doctors are scared of prescribing anything that might be abused, they switched me to Straterra which did nothing except make me miserable with side effects. Then they put me back on stimulants that worked great. Then they switched me to Wellbutrin.

All that Well butrin did for me was make me calm about the mess my ADHD was making of my life. I blew off very important stuff like filing and paying taxes for years. I would say that my Wellbutrin prescription was a major contributor to my debt, to the tune of about $80,000 in interest and penalties.

I then insisted on being put back on stimulants and I told my doctor that I do not care if they take 5 years of my life span, as life is not worth living in a state of terror and failure without them.

Just my five cent's worth. But if you do not get any kind of relief from your symptoms with Wellbutrin, be the squeaky wheel and insist on being treated with medication that is the proven first choice for most people with ADHD."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I've got ADHD, depression, and anxiety and have been on Wellbutrin for about 2 years now for the ADHD. It's not perfect but it has helped my ADHD symptoms a lot. I tried it after coming off of Concerta (I was having blood circulation problems in my fingers and toes). I'm also on Lexapro because the Wellbutrin wasn't quite enough for the depressive symptoms.

That said, my wife (also ADHD) tried Wellbutrin, did okay on the starting dose but had massive panic attacks once it was bumped up to the therapeutic dose. Not trying to scare you, just letting you know that people seem to have a broad spectrum of reactions to this one and that YMMV."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"As others have noted, bupropion is a dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, which is why it works for adhd. Amphetamines induce the brain to release more dopamine and norepinephrine. Same end effect of increased levels, different mechanisms.

There‚Äôs no ‚Äúbetter‚Äù medication when it comes to ADHD, you just have to find the one that works best for your brain chemistry. It may be a stimulant, it may be a non-stimulant. The odds are the same.

Incidentally, stims didn‚Äôt work for me, but a non-stim does everything adhd meds are supposed to.

Try it and see."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I have ADHD and do not do well with stimulants. Wellbutrin has worked much better for me. Since peri menopause has begun I‚Äôve added a baby dose of Prozac that helps with all the new fluctuations in my hormone levels. I do think if you feel like you were dismissed by this Doctor, you should seek another opinion, but the Wellbutrin may help and isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad option. Good luck!"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I started on Wellbutrin first as well. After I gave it a solid try for 4 weeks, that‚Äôs when I got put on vyvanse. They want to make sure non-stimulants don‚Äôt work first, because for a lot of people they do :-) don‚Äôt switch your psychiatrist just yet! After you give it a few weeks and see no difference then you can talk to them about other options"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Wellbutrin helps a lot with motivation. I take both it and Adderall. I feel like the side effects of Adderall are more apparent than those from Wellbutrin, so I think it's worth a shot! Wellbutrin also makes it possible for me to skip a day or two on the stimulant, which can be nice if I need a break."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,They pretty much always try to rule out anxiety first. I've done the round of antidepressents when I was younger. I hate the side effects and I dont believe they actually helped with anything as I believe my anxiety is from my unmanaged ADHD. I just repeated I did not want to do antidepressents. I had to fight the dr everytime. I have managed to get my meds but I had to push back. politely of course.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Along the lines of what some others have shared, my experience has been that once I demonstrate a willingness to try the suggested solutions, the providers become more and more willing to present the riskier and often more effective solutions, like stimulants. It takes time and a certain degree of surrender to the process. My suggestion is to just keep after it until you find a solution that works for you."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Wellbutrin is also commonly prescribed off label for ADHD. they could potentially be trying to gauge your reaction to a non stimulant since stimulant medications are controlled substances
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Wellbutrin is often used for ADHD.  Bupropion XL is actually the first drug that silenced my noisy mind and provided an additional clue that stimulant medication could actually be useful for me.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Wellbutrin is one of the 3 antidepressants I was on before Adderall. Non worked but the Wellbutrin made me have a lot of suicidal thoughts. Adderall completely changed my life. I wish I would have started it 20 years earlier. Always feeling like a failure will make anyone depressed. And trying to explain to people that think you are lazy, rude, inconsiderate etc that ""no, you really can't just get it together.""
Anymore than they can't just not be stupid anymore. 
If the Wellbutrin doesn't help significantly keep pushing until someone helps you. There are actually tests for ADD that evaluate your symptoms. He should be giving you one of those instead of just going on his opinion after one conversation."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,ADHD often coincides with dopamine issues.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I take wellbutrin and trintrellix (a serotonin modulator).  It didn‚Äôt get rid of all my symptoms and that‚Äôs how i found out i have ADHD.  They added a small dose of adderall on top of that.  

The wellbutrin helped with my motivation and the adderall helped me with the concentration both have helped me immensely together.

And yes, my doc mentioned that i def not bipolar as if i took the meds that i was taking i would have gone manic. 

I also got a dx for sleep apnea as well.  

I was still having issues, Thats why he suggested ADHD.  He was right. They rule out possibilities as you get treated."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"im on wellbutrin. my psychiatrist explained it to me as it's not FDA approved as a ADHD medication, but it still has the components to help as if it was, and a lot of psychiatrists prescribe that first before they will start controlled substances. this is just what she told me, i hope this finds you well! if you are super unhappy with it, it's your body and mind, talk to your doc!!! it's helped me with my adhd quite a bit"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I was put on Wellbutrin when my psychiatrist suspected ADHD but not yet diagnosed. It made my heart rate shoot through the roof, and we thought I couldn‚Äôt handle a proper stimulant bc of anxiety.

However I don‚Äôt generally have that issue on adderall now that I‚Äôve been diagnosed. Every body is different!"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"For what it‚Äôs worth, Wellbutrin is the only thing that‚Äôs helped me with my ADHD symptoms. Every stimulant I tried was a complete disaster. My point being, while it obviously varies by person, I‚Äôd give Wellbutrin a fair chance - it might help."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I started Lexapro last year and it definitely helped a bit with the ADHD symptoms that were, as of then, untreated. I believe it has to do with the extra serotonin it helps to keep in your brain. Definitely didn‚Äôt treat it completely but certainly helped. 

You can always seek a second opinion, too. Not ideal, obviously due to time and money costs, but if you truly believe this may be a thing, by all means talk with another care provider about it."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Welbutrin also helps with attention, my advice would be to stick with it for a few months and see how you feel."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"My psychiatrist did this to me too.  Straterra (also a non-stimulant) was next, followed by adderall when neither worked.

Jump through the hoops and give it a try.  Wellbutrin does actually work for some people.  And if doesn‚Äôt, report that and move onto the next option."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Wellbutrin is good for ADHD too.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I started on welbutrin by my own request when I was first diagnosed. At the time, I was concerned about addiction/side effects so I thought an alterntive was a good place to start. For me, Welbutrin definitely helped with my focus but it gave me horrific mood swings and I felt pure RAGE at the littlest things. So after a few months I requested to switch to a stimulant and it works much better for me. 

All that said, give it a try, monitor your side effects and keep in contact with your doctor. Good luck!"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Wellbutrin targets the same receptors as stimulants. Everyone is different, but I believe Wellbutrin saved my life as the first ADHDish medication I‚Äôve taken. Fun fact, Wellbutrin was originally developed for people trying to quit smoking! Regardless of where I‚Äôm going next with my meds, I‚Äôm keeping the Wellbutrin."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,I personally use Wellbutrin for ADHD and its the only medication I've found to work without causing me serious side effects.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Wellbutrin promotes wakefulness. Technically not a stimulant but has those effects. Tomato, tomato. It‚Äôs used for narcolepsy for the same reason."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"My husband, brother & sister in law and I are all ADHD. 
I'm on stimulants, but both my husband and Brother were put on Wellbutrin. 
My brother because he was concerned about the habit forming nature of stimulants and my husband because his depression and ADHD are both pretty severe. They both love it and swear by it. My brother called me a few weeks ago to celebrate that he can do math in his head again. 
SIL and I are both stimulants (I'm on ritalin, she just started Vyvanse) we love them but some of the side effects are pretty intense, and if I ever have to go off ritalin, Wellbutrin will be my first choice 100%

I wouldn't take it as a sign that your prescriber didn't take you seriously. I'd give Wellbutrin a solid couple of months  and if it's not helping enough ask for something different."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"It occurs to me that the doctor may be trying to help you while avoiding running into regulations for the more traditional ADHD meds. I required a specialist to prescribe it before my doctor you fill out a script, This took months. When I talked to him about my anxiety issues, he handed me antidepressants, no further questions asked. 

Considering the antidepressants have had as dramatic a difference in my life as Concerta, I could understand a doctor sidestepping your want for a diagnosis in favor of seeing hiw you respond to medication fist.


Just a thought."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,A little googling indicates Wellbutrin is used off-label as non-stimulant ADHD med. I had a friend who is ... Older ... Who was also diagnosed with anxiety. so the doc prescribed Wellbutrin to address both.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"This medication works concomittantly with amphetamine sulfate I am so tired of fellow medical / psychiatric colleagues addressing ADHD with antidepressants and not amphetamine rx 
I know that it takes time in most countries to secure an appt with psychiatrists but if he/ she is not TRULY listening , please find another practitioner"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Wellbutrin is a Dopamine Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor. So while Adderall and Vyvanse have you produce more dopamine, wellbutrin keeps it active longer. 

Some psychiatrists will off label it because it's not controlled and such"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I was given Wellbutrin first for adhd as well, it kinda sorta helped but not really. Got adderall recently (on top of the Wellbutrin not instead of) and it‚Äôs kinda sorta helping but not really as well lol 

It‚Äôs a process. Let them know what you think and how it‚Äôs effecting you, if they are dismissing adhd concerns then maybe time to look for someone else"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I actually asked for Wellbutrin before trying a stimulant for my ADHD as well as depression. My ADHD was what motivated the choice though, since it's a norepinephrine dopamine reuptake inhibitor. SSRIs didn't work for me, and this had the added benefit of possibly helping my ADHD. And it did, a little bit. It doesn't hurt to try it, it doesn't have the side effects most antidepressants have and it's often used for things like quitting smoking because it affects the areas of the brain (that also impact ADHD) dealing with reward and motivation. I do agree they shouldn't have written it off so fast. I'd stick with the Wellbutrin a few months and try to keep track of your experiences that lend to ADHD concerns and you can come to the doctor again and say ""Hey, these issues (focus, attention, time management, executive function, etc) are still not any better what are our next steps?"". There is some symptom overlap with depression and doctors unfortunately like to think they know our experiences better than we do. I know how hard it is to find the right doctor, so I'd try to play it this way and if he still won't take your concerns seriously you can start looking for another. It helped that I had my therapist backing me up on these issues, it lent credibility to my concerns.

I really hope things work out for you."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"As others have said, try it out! I am on Concerta and Wellbutrin and it‚Äôs the combo that has worked for me. 

I actually went to seek mental health because I thought I was depressed but instead I got the ADHD diagnosis and realized several symptoms of ADHD have caused me to feel super depressed."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"This happened to my sister. As others have mentioned, there ARE viable situations for it. In my sisters case, the doctor kept saying ‚Äúthis sounds more like depression‚Äù and diagnosed Wellbutrin based on that. It wasn‚Äôt depression, it‚Äôs ADHD, and Wellbutrin is hefty stuff‚Ä¶she felt physically awful for weeks, finally said screw this and decided to stop, but you have to taper off slowly otherwise your body goes into withdrawals. The whole ordeal took months and she ended up starting from square one with a new doctor."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,[deleted]
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Wellbutrin effects dopamine which is the neurotransmitter involved in adhd. My dr tried it first. If it works, it works. But if you arent happy with the effects or it doesnt give u the desired solution speak up and tell them you want to try something else like a stimulant. 

My dr rationale was that stimulants effect sleeping and I already have erratic sleeping habits. But wellbutrin made me feel sick and some other things so finally on stimulants üòÆ‚Äçüí®"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I don‚Äôt know that fatigue is an ADHD symptom. A lack of motivation can be but that‚Äôs an accessory symptom of a lack of executive function. It depends on what other symptoms you have. Depression, on the other hand, can present as just fatigue and a lack of motivation. But your psychiatrist put you on a medication that can treat depression *or* ADHD but many people with ADHD also need a stimulant so Wellbutrin wasn‚Äôt a bad choice to start with."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"If 'tired' means waking tired, then feeling more alert finally by evening, occasional headache, waking with dry mouth, waking in the night especially to pee, then it might not be ADHD.  If your nose is congested when you sleep, it might not be ADHD."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"wellbutrin is an interesting medication- it is technically an antidepressant, but it's also used to treat adhd and anxiety for some people. it's good that you're trying it! if you don't feel like it's right for you though, you should talk to your doctor. if they still don't seem to really listen or understand what you're trying to tell them, maybe find a new one. my personal experience with psychiatrists hasn't been the greatest. it took me a long time to find someone that really listens to me but it was well worth all the waiting and effort. i was misdiagnosed for years but now that i'm finally on the right medication for me my life is way easier. best of luck!"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"This also happened to me. I did not want to be on Wellbutrin because I've already been on a similar drug in college that drastically increased suicidal thoughts. He basically said I had to try Wellbutrin or he'd drop me as a patient. That was pretty underhanded from him, considering how long I had to wait to even see him to begin with. 

Lol & behold, suicidal thoughts started to increase and suddenly that's all my regular therapy sessions were about for awhile. I was finally switched to a stimulant after my therapist (who's from the same practice as my psychiatrist) intervened with my permission."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Wellbutrin is used to treat adult ADHD. I‚Äôm on it twice daily. It helps. It doesn‚Äôt have the zombie-like downer effects of typical SSRIs, it more of a stimulant. It‚Äôs drug class is technically an atypical antidepressant.

When all is said and done, it‚Äôs not the night and day difference methylphenidate makes me for me, buts definitely better than nothing. Your mileage may vary‚Ä¶ could be a game changer or not help at all, but there‚Äôs at least enough evidence to convince me to give it a shot.

Also, I am not depressed either, it‚Äôs only used for ADHD."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"God, I went through the exact same thing and it was infuriating. I've taken many different antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications in the past but none of them ever worked. When I was diagnosed with ADHD, the first and only thing I was prescribed was 300mg Wellbutrin. It did nothing. I felt like I had to entertain my doctor with her different prescriptions (Wellbutrin, Straterra, Guanfacine, etc etc etc) until I was able to request stimulants without it being a red flag."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"(Diagnosed - inattentive type) I‚Äôm not taking stimulants, I AM taking Venlafaxine (SNRI) for the related anxiety and depression. I can actually sit still during movies now, my impulse control is a bit better, and I can go to sleep at a normal time every night. It can be more beneficial than you‚Äôd think."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I'm in a similar boat just different meds...I can't concentrate, feel like I can't remember things to the point I'm wondering if I have dimentia, but hyper focus on things so hard I forget to pee all day.  Been on Effexor for 2 months and while it's mellowed me out somewhat, I still struggle with focus.  Not sure when I go back next week for my follow up if I should try and reinsist for a second adhd eval (1st one was negative after 4 hours of testing)"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Idk if it‚Äôs different in other states, but you don‚Äôt necessarily need to see a psychiatrist. My PCP prescribes me 20mg Adderall XR and he is the one who diagnosed my ADHD. Same thing for my daughter."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,I was put on Wellbutrin for my suspected ADHD while I was getting diagnosed as it can help with ADHD as my main problem was motivation to do tasks. Now I'm on both Wellbutrin and Ritalin after my diagnosis and its a great combo for me. It did take about a month of the Wellbutrin to fully start working though as an FYI
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Psychiatrists won't prescribe stimulants until you have test results from an evaluation stating stimulants/ADHD treatment would be beneficial. Until that point they will try other things, Welbutrin also acts on your norepinephrine receptors and norepinephrine can help with ADHD symptoms in some cases. Other non stimulant meds they could try before an actual diagnosis might be Strattera or Invega as well."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Welbutrin, as others have stated helps with adhd and is used off label for it. I was in a similar situation to you. I was diagnosed with adhd, as well as depression and anxiety (yay).

I think a part of it is that unless I was writing down notes of my symptoms, I wasn't very good at remembering all of them and all the issues it was causing. Also, usually stimulants aren't first line of treatment because of the potential for abuse.

Between now and your next appointment, or even in the few minutes before because trust me I know habits are hard, try to keep notes/a log of your symptoms. Include what they were before, where welbutrin helped, and any side effects if you experienced any.

Once I did that, my psych understood that the welbutrin was helping out with the depression but was (for me personally) doing very little for the adhd.

It helped my focus and executive function, but only a little. That's what writing down notes helped me and the psych understand. It helped me be specific."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Because bupropion is a norepinephrine‚Äìdopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) your psychiatrist actually gave you an atypical antidepressant that can actually have a lot of effects on cognitive function and motivation. It should still help you with your adhd. I‚Äôm on an SNRI and it is helping me terribly much. I still recommend you find a psychiatrist that listens and supports you but you are on a medication that can help you :) 
Hope this helps"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Wellbutrin acts as a stimulant similar to ADHD meds. It is the only anti depressant medication that does so. She is likely seeing if a stimulant helps and if your symptoms improve on a stimulant and anti depressant. The symptoms you described are shared by depression and ADHD.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Wellbutrin made me feel terrible, but I responded poorly to most depression meds except mirtazapine. I don‚Äôt think starting with a well known anti depressant is necessarily wrong or concerning, but if you feel like the doc didn‚Äôt listen to you I would suggest seeking out a second opinion.

My first psychiatrist never talked to me for more than 15 minutes and tried dozens of medications for my various symptoms which made my life very hard for about 18 months. I tried a second psychiatrist who started with a 90 minute intake in which he asked an exhaustive list of questions and came to the determination I had adhd, which wasn‚Äôt what I was expecting. I‚Äôm on mirtazapine and adderall now. It hasn‚Äôt solved all my problems, and the side effects created a couple new ones, but overall I‚Äôve seen a net improvement using medication for depression and adhd.

Sometimes it takes a few tries to find a doctor who listens and isn‚Äôt just checking boxes."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I‚Äôm on bupropion and I LOVE it. Unlikely that I will ever need a stimulant. For ADHD, not depression"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Tamping down anxiety often helps with things. Think about our frequent decision paralysis, reduced underlying anxiety and you‚Äôll find many things get easier. Stimulants (Vyvanse!) are amazing, but can often turn up the anxiety dials as well.  YMMV. Advocate for yourself.  Good luck."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"They gave you Wellbutrin because unlike SSRI which effects your serotonin, Wellbutrin effects your dopamine instead. It‚Äôs advertised as an antidepressant because some people are lacking dopamine instead, which in turn can make you depressed. They do this because they want to rule out that it‚Äôs not depression. Doctors really avoid giving out controlled substances as much as possible. I‚Äôve gone to multiple therapist for ADHD treatment and they always want me to jump through the antidepressant hoops to get to what I need to be treated for. I call Wellbutrin micro adderall because it does raise my energy levels but it doesn‚Äôt help with the actual motion of doing things I need to be doing nor does it help with focus. I say try it out so they can get you on the right path for ADHD treatment. Wellbutrin is way more then an antidepressant, it‚Äôs used for multiple things. For me, they started me on Zoloft üòë When the Zoloft wasn‚Äôt working they put me on Wellbutrin with Zoloft. Now I‚Äôm on the max doses and it‚Äôs still not working so I‚Äôm hoping they finally believe that I have ADHD. It‚Äôs the shitty reality of our mental health care system."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Theyre seeing if they can tackle the issues without cutting to giving you a controlled substance. This is part of the process just take it as youre supposed to and be honest w your doc about what it fixes or dosnt fix. The more frustrated you seem about it the more likely you are to get written off. Just build the trust by trying their way first for a bit and be patient.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"My symptoms are well managed with Wellbutrin. My doc started me on a low dose and we increased to 300mg, which seems to be the sweet spot for me. In fact, I just learned that my pharmacy filled the wrong prescription (150 instead of 300) but I didn‚Äôt realize until this morning when I found my old bottle. This past week I‚Äôve been worrying that my body was building up a tolerance to it because I‚Äôve been all over the place and experiencing a return of symptoms. It never occurred to me to examine the label because I took for granted that the pharmacist would do their job correctly. 

Turns out I was just taking half the dose I was supposed to. Took two 150s today and within an hour felt completely better. I went from being a mess yesterday telling my husband how overwhelmed I was and how I felt like I was falling behind at work because I just couldn‚Äôt concentrate and keep up with the barrage of things I had to do and how I just wanted to drop everything and please pretty please can we take a vacation SOON or I‚Äôm going to effing snap‚Ä¶to this morning after taking the correct dose and telling him ‚Äúoh I feel better now and know exactly how I need to manage my time today to catch up, let‚Äôs put that impulsive getaway on the back burner.‚Äù"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"(ADHD-I here)

Wellbutrin was what they started me on first too and honestly, it worked better than the subsequent 3 ADHD meds I tried (Strattera, Guanfacine, Clonidine). I just turned out to be violently, full-body hive-allergic to Wellbutrin. Give it a shot!!! I remember feeling clear-headed for the first time in ages."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"It's possible he's just trying to rule out other diagnoses before putting you on stimulants. ADHD meds can be addictive and there's actually a shortage of some of them where I live, so if his perception was that your major complaints were more aligned with depression then he might be trying to make sure that there aren't other ways to help or if there's a shortage of what he's prefer to prescribe you with then he could also be trying to get you on something in the meantime and reasses down the road. If you don't feel listened to then definitely seek a second opinion, but keep in mind that you need to be open to listening to what they have to say. If you go in saying ""I think I have this because I googled my symptoms"" you're going to be subject to more scrutiny and they're definitely going to try to rule out anything else first"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Wellbutrin sometimes does help! For me it helps a little especially on days I don't need to be working.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Doctor put me on Jornay and Wellbutrin. For inattentive ADHD some anti-depressents help the executive dysfunction. Having had spans of time where I've had to wait for one but not the other, the two meds are basically two halfs of the puzzle.

If I'm on Wellbutrin but not Jornay, I'm really wanting to be responsible, do things, but I just can't, and I sit there sad.

If I'm on Jornay but not Wellbutrin, I don't want to do those things, I want to do other things, and you can't make me.

Basically, the first fixes not pulling the trigger, the second fixes emotional regulation so I pull the right trigger."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,I'm taking Wellbutrin for ADHD and it's greatly helped with motivation. Many drugs are used off lable in this way. Recently I've added a very small dose of Adderall and that combo is about as good as you'll get with symptom control IMO. My 24-year-old son was diagnosed with ADHD when he was 5 and we have used all the stimulants on him right now he is using strattera which is very similar to Wellbutrin in the way it works in the brain.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,I have ADHD and they put me on wellbutrin first and then introduced stimulants on top of that. Wait it out dude
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I actually combine Wellbutrin with adhd meds to make them more effective. I am not depressed. It is typical and good practice of doctors to exhaust other options, before prescribing highly addictive amphetamines. To my knowledge Adderall is a last resort for doctors."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I suggest you try out an adhd specialist. I went in to my primary care and luckily they had an adhd specialist there. He came in to talk to me and after an hour he looked at the doctor, sighed, and nodded saying ‚Äúyup, let‚Äôs plan how to move from here‚Äù. They had me journal two sections in a week for ‚Äúfloating away‚Äù moments vs ‚Äúhyperactive  moments‚Äù. They reviewed it and now they are giving me 3 forms to fill out which have to be filled out by 2 people who I grew up with, one including a parent. The next step is a urine test toxicology test to make sure im not taking other substances and a consent form for starting a controlled substance. I‚Äôm going to be taking vyvance if I‚Äôm insurance covers it. If not, I will be taking adderall.  I really hope you can find the help you need. I suggest watching YouTube videos to learn more about adhd. No one knows you better than yourself. I love watching ‚Äúhow to adhd‚Äù on YouTube. She‚Äôs super informative. Good luck"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I had this exact thing happen, and I was on Wellbutrin for two months before my psych took my ""nothing changed"" concerns seriously. However, I didn't come in with ADHD in mind, I was just really struggling in school and they wrote it off as depression, when in reality my ""depression"" was probably caused by ADHD making school harder. Chicken or the egg type scenario."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I had a horrible time on wellbutrin. (I was put on it for weight loss before I knew I had ADHD).   
 It's now listed as a medical allergy for me.  Might be me, but FYI

It made be incredibly lethargic.  At one point, I was in a parking garage and dropped my work phone. I remember thinking: ""Meh, I can just leave it there.""  Then big brain was like - ""Dude, no you cannot.""  I got off the meds that day.

Again, may be just me, but I'm certain the malaise and lethargy was from wellbutrin."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I played along. Took the meds for as long as I could tolerate which was 7 weeks and then told them I was still taking them. All the while my symptoms were still persisting.

 Stay patient and persistent is my advice."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Idk if the difficulty with finding another provider is the general difficulty of the process or an insurance problem, but ZocDoc can let you find just about any provider shockingly quickly."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Wellbutrin is very similar to an ADHD medication called Strattera. I was on Strattera for like four year (switched because it was too expensive) and it worked fine.

If they gave you Wellbutrin, I recommend you try it. Track your symptoms and side effects if there are any present."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"This appears to be the common response to any adult with ADHD concerns, at least in my experience. I did the same thing and was put on Wellbutrin. I was on it for a little over a year before I really started pushing to get a real diagnosis. After I got diagnosed I kicked the Wellbutrin after being prescribed Concerta. 

I feel like it‚Äôs the default response for clinicians because it can be used to treat ADHD ‚Äúover the counter‚Äù per say, because Wellbutrin isn‚Äôt a controlled substance. Try it for a bit. If you don‚Äôt think it helps, keep pressing them for a real diagnosis."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,I'm taking bupropion as well and don't forget : People with ADHD have less dopamine and noradrenaline. This medication will give you a bit more so it's closer to usual!
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Wellbutrin boosts dopamine & norepinephrine, two things ADHD people need. I was just switched & it does help calm my brain and emotional dysregulation, not as much for my depression."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"My psych started me on antidepressants as well, the idea being that most adhd symptoms can also be depression symptoms. He told me it's fairly standard to treat depression first,  then move on to treat adhd if the symptoms persist."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Wellbutrin is like the first antidepressant they offer you if you have adhd. I took it in the past when I didn‚Äôt want to be on a stim. It doesn‚Äôt achieve the same results for me but it did help with symptoms. Probably the only ssri I ever tried that I would recommend to just about anybody.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Wellbutrin is approved as treatment for ADHD. If you look it up in epocrates, or any current medical database, you will see that one of the listed uses of Wellbutrin is for adhd. Plenty of drugs have more than one use. Topamax was created as an epilepsy drug but it was found to work to prevent migraines. If someone is taking topamax for migraines, no one is saying their diagnosis is epilepsy."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Wellbutrin was originally developed for ADHD. I've used it for both for years now. While the stimulants did more, they also had more side effects I didn't like, such as tight mouth, etc. Currently I've added Straterra to Wellbutrin and get pretty good results. That said, I would go back and ask to be screened for ADHD, which he should do, or find another provider who will listen to you."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"wellbutrin was the second medication i tried (after strattera) and even though personally i had a god-awful reaction to it (i already have pretty bad anxiety and that medication only exacerbated it) i know so many people it has helped with ADHD. it‚Äôs an NDRI, increasing dopamine and norepinephrine, like amphetamines/methylphenidates do, just in a different way! there‚Äôs a tiktok user who explains this perfectly, your.psych.pharmacist. she makes videos about tons of other medications for other psychiatric conditions that are fascinating lol"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"The doctor didn‚Äôt  intend to misprescribe or misdiagnose you. Wellbutrin IS indicated for ADHD, either on or off label. Stimulants are not necessary for every single ADHD treatment case (which is a good thing), and you should be prescribed them after other treatments - that‚Äôs just good medical practice. People self diagnose themselves all the time and doctors try to avoid that. Incorrect self diagnoses are VERY common and people often don‚Äôt think X medication will work for them because they‚Äôve googled their symptoms and aligned themselves with Y disorder.

Though doctors of course - most of them - are trying to give you the best care they think you should get in their mind. Maybe your doctor prescribes Wellbutrin to all ADHD type cases as first line treatment, and only 40% of his more severe ADHD cases graduate to stimulant based therapy. But the Wellbutrin works for the 60%, so the doctor believes it‚Äôs good first line treatment. Prescribing the least amount of C2 narcotics while giving the best care is good practice, and a priority for doctors legally, ethically, morally, etc."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,As I‚Äôm sure had been stated by now but I don‚Äôt feel like scrolling the comments. Wellbutrin can be used to help adhd even though it‚Äôs ‚Äúlabeled‚Äù as and antidepressant. I actually just had a chat with my doctor and she was saying Wellbutrin might be a better avenue for me than adderall cause it can help with several different areas rather than just one.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Wellbutrin is very well accepted as an ADHD treatment. Don‚Äôt let the label deceive you. It‚Äôs an atypical antidepressant meaning it doesn‚Äôt have the same mechanism of action as other antidepressants.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Your doctors choice seems sensible as Wellbutrin is an antidepressant that is effective for adhd. Depression, even in mild cases, tends to cause disturbances in the same areas as adhd. Also, when in such a state, adhd medications won‚Äôt be very effective. It seems he suspects some level of depression and wants to treat it or rule it out before proceeding to the next step of full on adhd treatment. Wellbutrin is a sensible drug to do so."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"This was the first medication I was prescribed by my doctor when I was diagnosed in April. It works very well for a lot of people. It is the most common depression drug to also treat ADHD! 

Unfortunately, it made me so effing tired. Like 3 naps in one day. I tried it for a month and then called my doctors office to try a different med. keep a journal of how you feel for the first month!"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Wellbutrin is a mild stimulant. It was prescribed to me for depression years back before it had ever occurred to me that I have ADHD, and it made a huge difference immediately. I even said, ‚ÄúWow, is this what it‚Äôs like to be normal?‚Äù People couldn‚Äôt understand why because it takes time for antidepressants to start working. It didn‚Äôt occur to me until years later that it was because it was treating the ADHD."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Wellbutrin increases dopamine and norepinephrine, these are two things an ADHD brain can lack. It can boost motivation, mood, and energy levels. It also synergizes really well with Adderall if you and your doctor go that route. Regardless of what you're actual diagnosis have you may have great results with Wellbutrin. I also highly recommend seeking cognitive therapy, medication and a good therapist synergize really well that give a 1+1=3 effect or even higher to whatever issue you're struggling with.
My advice would be to follow your Doctors instruction but keep a diary log of EVERYTHING. Log your side effects, mood, improvements of the symptoms you have told the doctor or things worsening, etc. It's very understandable if you don't wish to go this route, since you know your body more than anyone else but you would be shocked at how many issues can go on without realizing it and undiagnosed. Also to get diagnosed, you have to check out a certain amount of boxes for ADHD, you can be in some awkward borderline. From my experience Doctors/Psychiatrists(I've had 10+ doctors since they constantly blew me off) don't like to diagnose you with things, they see it as okay you might be experiencing some mild symptoms of ADHD or depression or XYZ, lets see if this medication can help your symptoms...
Also just having a lack of motivation and low energy can be caused by depression, it doesn't exactly have to be negative thoughts or sadness(I was this type). ADHD brains can also have volatile energy levels, you can be filled with energy at one moment but be horribly lethargic at another moment. Just some things that may help keep it in mind.
Set up your next appt with another Doctor to get a second opinion and maybe even more 
I hope at least one thing of this helps"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Wellbutrin is off label for ADHD. It also has antidepressant effects that help u sleep, eat and feel better in general as well as improving your motivation.

I tried Concerta, which made me jittery. And Ritalin gave me bad nausea. I currently take Medikinet on special days when i really need to focus because it is expensive.

I have been on Fluvoxamine for years for my major depression. Im going to switch to Wellbutrin to quit smoking as well as help my depression and ADHD at the same time. Im hopeful! üòÑ"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I‚Äôm diagnosed adhd but I already have an issue with fast heart rate and so no doctor wanted to put me on stimulants. Luckily wellbutrin exists and for a while now has been used to treat also adhd so you should give it a try and see. With any medication it‚Äôs always trial and error.

I haven‚Äôt started taking yet but soon. Good luck!"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"i spoke with a psychiatrist yesterday, she diagnosed me with adhd/depression/anxiety. i completely dismissed the idea of having depression but then looked in to the symptoms and they go one on one. she still gave me the choice to treat whichever i think is interfering with my day to day life the most and i chose adhd, so she sent an adderall prescription over to the pharmacy and i was able to pick it up on the same day! she said that if it were up to her she would address the anxiety first, i agree but i'm also stubborn and desperate for control over my life. todays my first day taking it & i definitely feel my heart racing faster due to anxiety i guess?? my mind does feel quieter tho

i'd definitely recommend going back or finding another doctor. i found mine on psychology today and managed to book a consultation for the following week! 

your ""depression"" could be due to the adhd so i def think combating your adhd would help with that. apparently depression doesn't necessarily mean you're sad all the time so you may still have it without acknowledging it"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Nothing quite like Vyvanse though
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I‚Äôm on bupropion and it has helped me. It was gradual, but I notice changes. I do have more follow through and motivation. Sometimes I don‚Äôt realize it until I think back and know I wouldn‚Äôt have finished that task before. Yes, I still have some issues, but I‚Äôm able to talk my brain through better."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Same here! Hoping to get a second proper evaluation in a month. Nothing like a doc completely invalidating everything you say eh
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I‚Äôm not a scientist so I don‚Äôt know the full details but Wellbutrin is an SNRI with a molecular structure similar to amphetamines. What does this mean? I hope someone else knows exactly. 

When I was on it I found it pretty stimulating and my focus improved. It‚Äôs stimulating but NOT a stimulant. 

The problem for me was that it also made me manic, which at the very least led to a bipolar i diagnosis some time after."

Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"ADHD is not something to be diagnosed in one visit to a provider. Your psychiatrist is right to try Wellbutrin or Straterra first, particularly if this is your first meeting with them and if you've never been seen for ADHD symptoms by any other provider in the past.

It's not invalidating your experience, or saying you don't have ADHD, but it is being responsible as a prescriber because stimulants need to be treated with care. Stimulant abuse and substance use disorders are deadly. A conservative provider is a sign of someone who you want to keep seeing, imo, they have your best interest at heart.

I've known my psychologist for nearly 4 years and I was only recently diagnosed with ADHD and it was after 5 lengthy hours of conversation dedicated to the symptoms I've experienced throughout my entire lifetime."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Wellbutrin is also described for ADHD. So calm down.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,I was diagnosed with ADHD and my medical professional suggested Wellbutrin since A) let‚Äôs risks involved (family history of addiction and substance abuse) and I don‚Äôt have insurance so it‚Äôs the cheapest option. It‚Äôs been almost 2 months and my life has changed a lot and people around me notice the difference. Don‚Äôt knock it until you try it.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Apparently Wellbutrin is great for treating ADHD.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I have been very skeptical of Wellbutrin used off-label to treat ADHD. I take Adderall and when I added Wellbutrin for other reasons, I didn't think it had any impact on my ADHD symptoms. But, my teenage son could not tolerate any of the stimulant meds and or the main non-stimulant one so his psychiatrist tried him on Wellbutrin and WOW, what a difference. In a few weeks he suddenly looked at his pile of late and late late homework and decided to sort, color-code and work his way through it, on his own. And he kept that up all the rest of the school year. It was quite the turnaround in executive function. He even asked to increase the dose, demonstrating a real buy-in vs his past med trials. So, you never know.

Would I want to be STARTED on Wellbutrin before stimulants? No. But it's not completely off base to try it at some point if other meds don't help or are contraindicated."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Wellbutrin is a cop out by doctors who are afraid of proper medication.

It may work well for someone who has a moderate case of ADHD, and is the proper front-line medication, but honestly in my experience people are mostly just afraid of the idea of stronger amphetamines most of the time. My doctor refuses to prescribe these meds."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Ughhhh why do they always do this? (Not a real question. Just ehhhhhh). This happened to me too, when I first brought up potiential ADHD to my psychiatrist, and prior to my official ADHD diagnosis (essentially I was brushed off and concerns ignored)."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Then go back, speak up and ask for the thing you want."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Had a similar experience.
What's worse is the depression meds they put me on had side effects that cause depression (indirectly).

Once I found out, I stopped taking them and stopped refilling it."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Stand up for yourself. Tell them you will not be taking the Wellbutrin because you don‚Äôt need it. You‚Äôre not depressed. You want to be tested for adhd. Or you can just find another doctor.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,It might give you acne. Be aware
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Don't forget, you are ultimately in charge. Push back if it isn't working for you, or has a negative impact. Ask questions if you aren't sure.

I lost many years of my life blindly following doctors' rote prescriptions. Always discuss details with the doc, ask why and what to expect, give detailed feedback on how it's working, and never take ""because I'm the doctor"" or ""because that's the way it's done"" for an answer."

Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"The first provider I saw did basically the same thing, completely dismissed my ADHD concerns and tried to offer me Wellbutrin. I told her she wasn‚Äôt listening to me, gave her a terrible survey response, and when the office called me to follow up, I told them what happened. They set me up with another provider, who finally referred me to a psychologist to get a diagnosis. (Literally all I‚Äôd been freaking asking for the whole time.) Once I had that I went back to her and she‚Äôs been great so far, am on Vyvanse with a small Adderall booster for the afternoons, and it‚Äôs been night and day better.

I personally wasn‚Äôt willing to just go along with taking something prescribed by someone who wasn‚Äôt actually listening to me or taking my concerns seriously. It‚Äôs up to you to determine if you think he was or not, though. It unfortunately can be quite a long process. :("

Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"They usually treat the depression if it‚Äôs present first see if that‚Äôs causing the symptoms.

Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I take both Vyvanse and Wellbutrin. I recently learned (by filling a prescription late) that they have some overlap in how they act on the brain. As a result, Wellbutrin can actually help with ADHD.

In my case I filled my Wellbutrin late but didn‚Äôt have any major withdrawal effects. That‚Äôs apparently only because Vyvanse was acting on the same receptors."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I had this too. They wanted to treat the moderate depression rather than the ADHD that causes the depression. I tried Wellbutrin and it made me feel horrible and I couldn't sleep. When I told them this, they wanted to give me Zoloft, something prescribed for heavy anxiety and depression. I said hell no, I'm not depressed or anxious, I'm not taking an SSRI. 

I went to another provider and this time, I didn't say anything that was depression and anxiety related. On the questionnaire, I made sure that I didn't select anything indicating depression or anxiety. Now they are treating my ADHD with Strattera (an actual ADHD medicine!) and it's going decently so far"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I was actually put on Wellbutrin first for my ADHD before Vyvanse, although Wellbutrin didn‚Äôt really effect my ADHD at all. I was in between moving to another city 3 hrs away and my current doctor wanted me to wait since she wouldn‚Äôt be able to check in with me and stuff, and I also have depression which is why the Wellbutrin."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I felt amazing on Wellbutrin, I quit smoking, I lost weight, I got more energy, my mood stabilized, I got more confident, etc, but I was still having ADHD symptoms, but since it's impossible to get diagnosed, specially since I have a vagina, my doc just upped my Wellbutrin to 450mg/day when I asked about ADHD treatment...  Anyways, I had a seizure, at work, hit my head and it looked like I went 5 rounds with Mike Tyson.  I was on Keppra for a while and I had all the side effects from that.  Now I'm on Effexor, up 15-20lbs, not smoking but craving, can't sleep at night, have no energy or will to work, and if I stand for too long (30 minutes) it feels like I'm going to pass out.  
Wellbutrin was good, but there is such a thing as too much of a good thing."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"IDK I did the same thing, got on Wellbutrin and it has been extremely helpful. 

There is a reason it is used off label for ADHD, because it‚Äôs helpful. 

Take it and then follow up if you are still having issues. And be prepared for a longer haul when trying to find medications, it‚Äôs sometimes a lot of trial and error."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,I had  Wellbutrin My friend said she was speeding around.Did nothing for Me.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Ask to be evaluated and if they can‚Äôt, start googling for adhd evaluations and start calling around. That medication takes like a month to take effect and it‚Äôs side effect is treating adhd and from what I read a mild form of it and its NOT a stimulants."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"go to someone specifically to get evaluated for ADHD. It‚Äôs more of a process than just talking, I had to fill out a 60 question test as well as get an observer to fill the same one out. Aside from that? Wellbutrin also acts on dopamine as well as serotonin! so it‚Äôs a nonstimulant treatment that can help w adhd struggles. Just because it‚Äôs classed as an antidepressant doesnt mean it‚Äôs only good at handling depression. I will say I got misdiagnosed with an anxiety disorder (I struggle with anxiety *because* of adhd, and simply didnt know i had adhd for 19 years) and it was frustrating to feel like my doctor wasnt able to pin down anything that actually fit what i was experiencing"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,From my experience doctors who cannot (or don‚Äôt want to) prescribe ADHD meds prescribe Wellbutrin off label instead. Personally it made me irritable and did not work for me.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"If you feel it isn‚Äôt working, express that to them.

Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,I was put on it for anxiety. I hated it. It made me way more anxious the first couple of weeks. Then i felt better. Then worse. Then better. It was a roller coaster of anxiety and indifference.

Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"It's pretty common, and I actually found an antidepressent helpful. Keep complaining to your doctor about how you can't focus on tasks, how you *forget what you're doing while you're doing it*, how it's been *happening since you were a kid,* etc. If your doc isn't a dick, they'll get the message."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I think it‚Äôs protocol for them to try Wellbutrin first. Try it for a while, say it‚Äôs not working, and the next step is probably adderall.  That‚Äôs what I didn‚Äôt the Wellbutrin didn‚Äôt really make a difference. I thought I had anxiety and would take an Ativan just to calm down and focus. Ever since I was out on adderall I don‚Äôt have to take my Ativan. I have a 30 pill bottle that is like 5 months old and I‚Äôve maybe only taken 5 of them when I have a true panic attack. 

My adhd presented as anxiety."

Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Try modafinil I would stay away from ssri/snri (which Wellbutrin is. P.s I think U can still buy them online but I‚Äôve tried adderall Ritalin modafinil A handful of ssri‚Äôs and snri‚Äôs clonidine as well. For me adderall and modafinil worked the best but modafinil made me too shaky so I‚Äôm on adderall
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,They use that to make treat it. Usually to start. It works really well but if you feel like you need the Adderall it will help with it.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,I was given wellbutrin for my ADHD as well bc its a much safer alternative to stimulants. It does the same job without the side effects of stimulants.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I recently was diagnosed with ADHD, but my first diagnosis was depression and I was put on Wellbutrin. This was about... I think 6, maybe 7 years ago? I'm still on it, because I definitely have a depressive disorder alongside my ADHD. 

If it doesn't help at all, then you know there's something else going on. If it does help but you're still struggling in other areas, then you'll be able to pinpoint more symptoms that could lead to a better diagnosis. 

Either way, you took the first step. It'll be a journey that's well-worth the effort."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Wellbutrin is an SNRI, Ritalin is an SNRI. Doctors like to start at the lowest dose of the weakest medicine and then work upwards, this is the responsible thing to do. Plus it's a pain in most places to be prescribed a schedule II medicine like Ritalin or Adderall. Urine tests, pill counts etc.

While Wellbutrin is not dictated for use for ADHD. It does have an off-label use for ADHD, and is well respected as such. Its a great first medicine to try. If it does not work, tell your doctor and they may raise the dose until they reach the cap at 450mg, if it still does not work you may be given Ritalin. Or an amphetamine. In my experience and knowledge amphetamines are usually the last medicine given."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"This happened to me for years and I would ultimately suggest going to another psych who will actually test you before just assuming you don‚Äôt have it. However - Wellbutrin did help me with my ADHD symptoms, in particular executive functioning. It was not as good as an ADHD med but it gave me a lil spark to get going.

ETA - I say you should switch even if this helps you because I personally think it‚Äôs beneficial to know what‚Äôs going on with you so that you can most effectively help yourself. Your coping strategies (outside of medication) will be different for ADHD vs depression."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I was treated for GAD before I was treated for ADHD. Did a year and a half on Lexapro and did some CBT, now I take Dexedrine. Made sense from the psychiatry perspective bc ADHD often occurs alongside anxiety/depression, and it‚Äôs easier to treat the ADHD when you‚Äôre equipped to reframe your thoughts regarding anxiety (i.e. some control over those raving thoughts we all know and love). Glad I went this route tbh"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I‚Äôve been on Wellbutrin and Strattera for my ADHD. Neither of them worked but they sure tried. Made me feel like an absolute zombie. Then they tried to put me on other antidepressants. Finally I got a doctor that listens to me and she looked at my chart and said ‚Äúwell, looks like you have tried everything, what do you feel you need?‚Äù I told her I wanted to be on adderall twice daily. We started at 20/10 and now I‚Äôm at 10/10 morning and afternoon. That‚Äôs what works for me, personally. You might have to try a bunch before you get to a right fit. Have open communication with your employer if you‚Äôre chill with them, your mood and work may fluctuate for a few months while you‚Äôre finding the right fit. If your employee sucks then I highly recommend not telling them a damn thing."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Anti depressant is a misnomer.  Their serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors.  And Wellbutrin is a great med to start on.  Welcome to the club.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Wellbutrin has been shown to treat ADHD and anxiety, might be worth giving it a try?

Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Wellbutrin can be good for ADHD folks who respond poorly to stimulants - it's one of the few dopamine reuptake inhibitors that isn't a scheduled substance.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,my doctor told me that welbutrin is sometimes used as kind of an under the counter version of adhd medication. welbutrin actually helped me so I say give it a shot
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Wellbutrin is also used for ADHD as a non stimulant. I was put on it at first.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Wellbutrin has long been used off label as a med for ADHD. I didn't find it helpful for that (or stratera either). I need a central nervous system stimulant.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I‚Äôm not going to say take it or don‚Äôt.  I will say that if you do take it, just be aware of any muscle tremors, tics, or movements that develop‚Äîesp around your mouth or neck.  Wellbutrin gave me tardive dyskinesia.  I didn‚Äôt know that was a thing until long after the movements started.  I wish someone had told me it was a possibility."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"The thing about psychotropic medications is that they increase production, or decrease reuptake, of specific neurotransmitters. In the case of ADHD, we want to increase availability of norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) and make sure it gets to the right places in the brain. A lot of psychotropic medications also have ""downstream"" effects meaning they indirectly increase other neurotransmitters. For example, an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) increases concentrations of serotonin but also can increase production of NE or DA through downstream effects or cascades systems. Neuropharmacology is very complex and not fully understood. Additionally, neuropharmacology is very much affected by everyone's specific neurochemistry and even epigenetic.

&#x200B;

Wellbutrin, or Buproprion, increases availability of NE and DA but is marketed as an antidepressant. As others have said, it can also be used for treatment of ADHD, smoking cessation, etc. Wellbutrin is not an amphetamine, but is considered to be one of the more stimulating of the antidepressant class. It can work for some people's ADHD. Some physicians may not turn to stimulants, such as amphetamines or methylphenidate, for many reasons including tolerance, withdrawal, abuse potential, cardiac side effects. As such, they may try something else. I don't think your diagnosis is being written off, but perhaps your physician or provider is not comfortable turning to a stimulant right away. This may be something to explore with them at your next visit. It would not hurt to give Wellbutrin a try. If you feel it has done nothing for you after a month, then discuss this with the prescriber. If they are not willing to prescribe a stimulant ,then you might want to consider managing your treatment with someone else.

Best of luck!

You may want to keep a journal to monitor its efficacy as you work with your doctor to see what medication is ultimately right for you."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,I had to go through Wellbutrin and Straterra until finally landed on something that works.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"So my doc once explained it like this: antidepressants have all three parts of influence: 
- activity upper 
- anxiety killer 
- the third that I forgot I think it might be downer 

Each medicine has all three in different parts/ proportions. I take an anti depressant against anxiety. Helpes me tons. Tried another - too much of an activator so we switched.

Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,My psych started me on Wellbutrin. After being on it for a few months I ended up asking if I could add an ADD med. I now take an Adderall/Wellbutrin combo. Tried Stratera for a bit but didn‚Äôt feel affective.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I was originally prescribed Wellbutrin for depression. I was surprised that it seemed to help my ADHD a little. I felt like my brain was more organized.  My psych tried to up my dose to 300mg from 150mg, but I didn't see any more improvement. So she backed the Wellbutrin back down to 150mg and gave me Lexapro as well. That was a friggin' nightmare. Everything about my ADHD was SO much worse on Lexapro. I couldn't remember why I walked from one room to the next. My mind was racing like I never knew possible. I stopped taking it and immediately felt better, so I was like okay doc, let's talk about ADHD, and she agreed after I made a case for it.

I'm writing too much, but long story short, she agreed I have ADHD, gave me Strattera, and that has helped a lot. I've been taking 150mg Wellbutrin and 60mg Strattera together for almost 2 months now, and I can feel a big difference--honestly, it's been life changing and I have a lot of energy (no zombie feelings). I read that they're both used for ADHD and actually potentiate each other, so they're a good pairing.

In retrospect, I don't think I was necessarily depressed, but having ADHD is pretty depressing in general, so I can see why she thought that (and I did too)."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I'd rather be on that 1000% than something like Zoloft. My psychiatrist told me that I was essentially bullshitting just trying to get meds, so he put me on Zoloft. I took it for a few weeks and it just made me feel like a zombie. I spoke to a friend who isn't a doctor but is going to school to become one and he told me that Zoloft would only make my ADHD worse so I stopped taking it and that if they won't prescribe me ADHD medication that I should at least try to get Wellbutrin because even though it's an antidepressant, it would still help the ADHD symptoms somewhat, and way more than Zoloft would."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,You make the shake? It no make you shake.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I know a lot of people here have shared their positive experiences, but mine was not so great when I tried it. Granted, it was the first medication I had ever been prescribed, but it made me much more anxious, gave me uncontrollable fidget spells, and did not help with my symptoms. I stopped taking them after a few weeks because I hated how it made me feel. Now I‚Äôm on 80mg of Atomoxetine (Buspar), and while I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs totally addressed the symptoms, the side effects related to my mood are night and day. Just as an alternative to consider."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I heard most ADHD treatment doesn‚Äôt usually start with stimulants, usually starts with something like wellbutrin. That‚Äôs what I started out with too, it didn‚Äôt help ADHD symptoms though so went to concerta. Wellbutrin did help my bipolar symptoms  though."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"In a complete reversal, I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder for years and took (Insert any SSRI HERE) with minimal results.  I was not anxious, but my problems were out of control.  


Finally saw a new Psychologist who said while I have co-morbid anxiety/OCD, it is likely ADHD.  Tested (don't recall name of test) off the charts for it.  Took stimulants, felt like my brain was fixed for years.  


I can no longer tolerate any stimulants, but I have plenty of coping mechanisms and I know how to recognize my ""scene change"" symptoms.  I wish I was still on them, but the body can't hang.  


Good luck to you."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"My psych did this exact same thing. 

It‚Äôs because I also have generalized anxiety. She was trying to make sure that it wasn‚Äôt the anxiety causing ADHD-like symptoms instead of the other way around. After a few months of Wellbutrin not doing much, I was prescribed Adderall. Trust the process.

Edit: Wellbutrin is also an off-label treatment for ADHD, as I‚Äôm sure people in this thread have said."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"If you don't want to take the meds then let them know, they literally can't force you"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Wellbutrin is pretty well known to be effective for ADHD symptoms. It is an anti-depressant but its also has a lot of similar effects as stimulants. It does wonders for my ADHD symptoms.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,As others have said wellbutrin has many uses. But give the medication time to work and get to stable levels. Patience grasshopper
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,I‚Äôm on Wellbutrin for anxiety/depression and the doc specifically chose that med because it has shown benefits to attention in some people.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Same thing happened to me and I was put on cymbalta. It did help. My sister has been diagnosed with ADHD as a 35 year old and she was put on Wellbutrin but it really seems to help her.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I took Wellbutrin for a while and it didn‚Äôt help me either. I have ADHD and depression, but you should give it a chance and then if all your symptoms don‚Äôt improve discuss alternatives"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Tell them it‚Äôs not working
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I was also initially prescribed Wellbutrin for my ADHD. My primary doctor didn‚Äôt want to start me on a stimulant because I had a history of anxiety and stimulants can exacerbate anxiety. I noticed a slight improvement with my ADHD, but not a whole lot. It also gave me horrible nightmares lol. I‚Äôm now prescribed Adderall and it‚Äôs helped way more, though I did notice a feeling of anxiety when I upped from 20mg XR to 30mg XR.

Someone else mentioned the current Adderall shortage, and honestly, I‚Äôd suggest giving Wellbutrin a chance just for that reason alone. It‚Äôs definitely a process figuring out the best medication for you, but ya gotta start somewhere"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Fwiw I have adhd and Wellbutrin works better for me than adderall ever did
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I was put on Wellbutrin for my ADHD as well. In my experience, doctors prefer to try other methods of treating your ADHD without just jumping to stimulants. Personally, I had to go on a stimulant to treat mine but everyone is different"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Adult ADHD is hard to diagnose, they need to rule out depression, bordeline personality, anxiety, bipolarity etc

So give it a try and see! Might help, might not help, but at least you can say you tried."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Well, you're in luck because Wellbutrin is often used to help treat ADHD and not just for depression. Some anti-depressants can benefit people with other issues and help ADHD symptoms. it can also help with things like weight."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Wellbutrin is often prescribed for adhd actually
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,My friend is on it and it works for him like a dream. Take it and you will see if it works for you.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Wellbutrin is a pretty incredible, life changing medication. It can definitely help ADHD. Heads up, it takes about eight or nine weeks to start to work. So be patient."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I have been diagnosed as depressed about 3 or 4 times over the years.  Each time I argue that I enjoy my life and that I am not depressed but I have no energy or motivation, and have mind fog.  They then test my thyroid function that comes back as normal then they got back to depression.  This was before I clocked on to the realisation that I had ADHD.  I haven't been back.  The humiliation of being told I was depressed and needed drugs for depression pissed me off and I turned them down every time.

I haven't dared to go back to a doctor.  I think I also suffer from ASD and when I tried to get help for that I was treated like dirt.  I spent ages writing up why I felt I had ASD.  The doctor was muscle bound and threw it straight into the bin then looked at me liked I was some sort of piece of shit on his shoe.  I daren't go back to the doctor for ADHD even though I know that is my condition now.  I think I am pretty fucking unlucky in life with both ASD and ADHD but I am doing okay.  I just think I am coasting and I could be flying."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I use Wellbutrin supplemental to my Adderall. I have severe adhd. I‚Äôve tried to go off medication (with dr oversight) and I could not do it. But because I wanted to get pregnant I needed to be on the lowest possible dose I could function on. Adderall XR 20 was not enough. Rather than bumping it up we increased my Wellbutrin and that did the trick! 

There are a lot of useful meds out there that have ‚Äúoff label‚Äù uses that are actually quite beneficial."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Yikes, that's a tough situation considering how long you waited for this appointment. Fortunately Wellbutrin can commonly be used to treat ADHD, but I think usually it's prescribed for that if you have depression/anxiety along with it or if you've already tried stimulants with no success."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"find another psychiatrist, preferably one who specializes in adhd. physiatrists handling adhd improperly is run of the mill but this level of incompetence is astounding"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I think you have plenty of comments here but wanted to say I think it‚Äôs pretty common not to jump straight to stimulants. I was given Wellbutrin first as well. Gave me awful, paranoid anxiety but that‚Äôs not the case for everyone. I‚Äôd also recommend doing a psych evaluation, that‚Äôs how I received my formal diagnosis."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Wellbutrin is one of the non-stimulants that actually has an indication for ADHD and personally I found it worked fairly well for my ADHD at the start (but that doesn't mean much to anyone else imo).
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I take that since wit helps with anxiety, depression and adhd and is great!"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Others have correctly explained that it makes sense, but I didn't notice any replies explaining *why* it makes sense to prescribe:  

Wellbutrin is a different type of antidepressant. Whereas most modern antidepressants are SSRIs or SNRIs, Wellbutrin is an N**D**RI. It inhibits the reuptake of dopamine (and norepinephrine), which basically results in there being more available to your brain to use. And since ADHD involves insufficient dopamine, this is a logical medication to try first."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Wellbutrin IS a stimulant alternative for ADHD. Yes, it's not something the average person thinks of when they think ADHD meds. Wellbutrin was the first medication I was put on when I was both ""having a hard time concentrating"" (hilarious now knowing how bad my ADHD is) and depressed. It made me feel like I couldn't care about anything.

What you should do is listen to your doctor. Keep taking the medication because it can take weeks to take affect. See how you are then."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Wellbutrin is different from other anti-depressants. It's not an SSRI, which I've found to be the absolute enemy of ADHD, especially if you struggle to stay energized. Wellbutrin is activating and can help; it's not just for classic depression."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"OP, I do what you do too by responding to everyone. It's very humorous to see all your replies! :)"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I was misdiagnosed and put on Wellbutrin when I was younger. The medication was the worst thing I could have taken. My anxiety was literally the only thing that was keeping me functional, without it, I stopped doing anything but gaming. I got evicted, I lost my job, I got expelled from school which caused me to lose my health insurance and I could no longer afford the medication which was causing me so many problems.

Sometimes anti-depressants can help with ADHD, but sometimes it can make your situation much worse, so be careful."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,They started me on that too!
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"My first ADHD treatment was Wellbutrin, and it actually worked quite well. I found it didn't ""quiet"" my brain as well as a stimulant did, but it helped with a lot of the impulsivity and forgetfulness. From what I remember, it works on the dopamine in your brain instead of serotonin (most anti-depressants are serotonin based), so it's thought to work well for ADHD as well. It might be more helpful than you think!"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"My friend was on that for a bit; he said it helped him, but he ultimately had to switch, because he likes to take med breaks, which he was told not to do while on that. I was misdiagnosed as depressed in high school and that was what I took; I don't remember if it helped with any ADHD symptoms, but I do remember that when I took a break as an experiment, and also when I ceased altogether, my impulsivity came back, and I started zoning out again.

(I may be the king of run-on sentences here, but I'll just blame the ADHD for that)"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I was on Adderall for about a year until last week. It helped my ADHD when i was on it but made my depression way way worse when it weared off. My doctor just switched me to Wellbutrin. 
According to her, it's mainly an antidepressant but ""off label"" can be used to also treat ADHD. It blocks the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine like Adderall does but to less of a degree. 
So your doctor may not be wrong. Just pay attention to how you feel and be honest with yourself and your doctor"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Please be careful with antidepressants of any kind.  I have had experience with them all.  Obviously this is just my experience, but you can research a number of other documented cases who have stated the same thing happening to them.  I also started with Wellbutrin for ADHD treatment and after 2 weeks called my doc emphatically telling them this is only compounded an existing problem with a problem that has been worked out over time.  My next appointment I went in with my head and chest high and just said I need to be on proper medication for ADHD and will not consider SSRI‚Äôs, Wellbutrin, or any other antidepressants.  Stimulants have been the gold standard for a reason."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I find so much overlap of anxiety with ADHD, the symptoms feed each other. I was put on Mirtazapine, and that helped my ADHD symptoms even more because it lessened my anxiety (and depression) greatly. I have been on Adderall for 24 years and the Mirtazapine now for almost 4 years. It's been a miracle drug for me since I tried so many other anti-depressants that didn't do anything or caused issues."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Make sure psych knows you don‚Äôt have an aversion to potentially addictive substances. That‚Äôs usually the main concern.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Because that's what they do.  They ignore you, and then they force you onto whatever SSRI pays them the most money.  It's been my experience too.  

Don't take that fucking pill by the way.   It will fuck you up.  Also from personal experience.

I've given up on finding treatment.  It's all scams and tricks the whole fucking way down while they bleed you dry every step of the fucking way and you're still in mental hell.

The only time i've been able to ever feel normal at all is the small handful of times I was able to buy adderall off of friends who grew up with well off parents who were able to get them doctors who actually gave a shit.  They only give a shit about the rich people."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,[removed]
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Wellbutrin is used off label for adhd and smoking cessation as well as appetite suppression for people trying to lose weight. Diagnoses aren‚Äôt black and white and there are a lot of grey areas. My therapist told me they are in the process of getting Wellbutrin approved for adhd. Idk if that‚Äôs true or exactly how it works but from what I understand it‚Äôs mainly insurance reasons. Wellbutrin works better for treating adhd in a lot of people than stimulants do. And for others it‚Äôs the opposite. Try it for as long as you need to figure out if it works and then try something else if you aren‚Äôt happy with it.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,While it‚Äôs an anti depressant it‚Äôs one known to be used off label for helping adhd symptoms. I was originally put on it to help with my tiredness/motivation and this was when both my psychiatrist and therapist suspected adhd but during my psy session didn‚Äôt have time for a full assessment and put me on this one to see if it helped. Only helped slightly with energy but I‚Äôve seen more benefit from Strattera (an antidepressant-like official adhd med). Took about a month and a half to two months to start noticing full benefits so unless you have really bad side effects it could be worth sticking it out or trying a higher dose.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Buproprion is not a standard antidepressant.

Most of what we think of as ""antidepressants""  are SSRIs or SSRNIs. They act mostly on serotonin.

Buproprion is more about dopamine, which has to do with focus and motivation.

It's often one of the first things tried for ADHD, since it's safer and easier to stop taking than other things. It's also used to help people quit smoking.

Trazodone is another example of something that's labeled an antidepressant, but gets used for other things-- particularly sleep.

And depression itself isn't just about feeling sad. Lack of energy or motivation are part of it."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Just find a different doctor , tell the new one the doc didn't feel comfortable Rx ADHD meds"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Why are people defending the psychiatrist for prescribing Wellbutrin, because it can also be used to treat ADHD, when the concern is that they didn't even think they have ADHD in the first place? ... It's like people don't read."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"My psych put me on Bupropion for months before we finally decided to add Vyvanse on. Definitely helped, though it wasn‚Äôt quite enough for me. I was also horribly depressed, so it definitely helped with that."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Its used offlabel for ADHD, it ups the dopamine neurotransmitters in your brain. Its just providers are watching their ass every day about controlled substances and are hesitant about giving stimulants."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I went to the psychiatrist for adhd and was prescribed Wellbutrin and it is working GREAT for me. I have heard it is often tried before stimulants. After two weeks of being on it, it was like a switch toggled on and my task initiation delay went from an hour to almost instantaneous"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I‚Äôm also on Wellbutrin off label for ADHD - it‚Äôs used because it helps keep dopamine around for longer, giving it more time to signal appropriately in your brain. ADHD has been linked with chronically low levels of dopamine, so by keep whatever dopamine you have around for longer, it can help mimic a brain with more dopamine. It helps a lot with cementing reward pathways in your brain"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"So I have BPD which is enlisted with comorbid diagnoses. ADHD being one of mine. 

I also study behavior psych in school so what I‚Äôm thinking(which also happened to me), I explained my symptoms to which she did express behaviorally, lack of motivation, attention and tiredness/restlessness can actually be caused by depression. Although it doesn‚Äôt seem it, and I don‚Äôt want to tell you how you feel so please correct me, depression can present in a plethora of ways which may not seem like ‚Äúnormal‚Äù depression. 

Although I suffer from MDD I found that my lexapro did in some extent decrease my ADHD symptoms. HOWEVER I **do** have ADHD, so once that medication didn‚Äôt fully work, she added adderall to that as well. 

Overall I see that depression is very often comorbid with ADHD diagnoses. Even having ADhD you can present with depressive symptoms because your brain is over working to concentrate. 

It‚Äôs a catch 22 sometimes. I hope this helps

Edit: I also want to mention I take eight to nine different medications daily. All because I have a plethora of symptoms. BPD cannot be treated by medication. Only the symptoms can. So for me, I only take my medications to subside the symptoms of behavioral issues I have from trauma."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Take it for 4-6 weeks and see how your life changes. I'm on Wellbutrin xl for ADHD and my life has changed significantly. Quit smoking, back in school, new career, personal projects get finished. Doctors prescribe it because it works. Stop thinking it's just depression meds."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Something similar happened to me when I first tried to get assessed. It turned out the place I first went to didn‚Äôt test adults for ADHD, only children, so they diagnosed me with depression and anxiety and put me on an Wellbutrin and an anti anxiety med. i tried them for a while and it helped me feel better‚Ä¶but it didn‚Äôt help with most of my symptoms. But I‚Äôm glad I tried because once I found another doctor, I was able to tell her I had tried treating depression and anxiety already, and that it didn‚Äôt improve my symptoms. She assessed me and diagnosed me with ADHD, and now I‚Äôm finally on Adderall and feeling and doing so much better."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,I just got prescribed this and I do have depression and anxiety. My dr did say they use it off label for ADHD. I totally feel so much better. Haven't been on Amazon to buy meaningless stuff and actually able to concentrate.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"My understanding is that Wellbutrin is only one molecule away from being vyvanse. That doesn‚Äôt _make it_ vyvanse, (just like table Salt is one molecule away from being pool water, they‚Äôre not the same) but they could be trying to find a solution with fewer issues for you. 

I was treated for depression for ten years before my therapist pointed out that most of my issues are anxiety related. It took a year after that to realize my anxiety is largely from not being able to control my thoughts. 

If it feels wrong, talk to your doctor. You‚Äôre the authority on your body. But it might be worth trying‚ÄîWellbutrin has a lot of off-label use."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,My doctor has me on a combination of Anafranil and Wellbutrin. She wants to stabilize my hormones before we introduce a stimulant.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"That was the FIRST thing I went on. I went through that, then an anxiety med, and now I'm on atomexitine. Pretty much the only ADHD med that isn't a stimulant. Working pretty well so far."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I‚Äôve spent the last 8 months feeling a little unmotivated and unfocused. I‚Äôm bipolar 1 and I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was because the lithium was screwing with the Vyvanse, or if it was hypothyroidism, or just a side effect. After I ruled out hypothyroidism and lowered my dose I kind of just accepted it and tried to cope. I had a very very stressful couple of weeks and it was starting to affect my mood so I took a leftover Seroquel two days ago. I stopped taking it and got onto lithium 8 months ago but I saved some for an emergency. 

Yesterday I woke up feeling great. Not just okay, but better than I have in months. I got more done in the last two days than I have in weeks. My appetite is back. I feel motivated to work. Seroquel could tranquilize a horse but somehow I have more energy.  

Turns out it was Occam‚Äôs razor. I‚Äôm bipolar and I had depression symptoms following a med change. Obviously I was depressed and I respond really well to Seroquel. 

My point being, it can be really hard to tell what‚Äôs happening in our own brains and doctors only know what we tell them. Just be as honest as you can with him at your next appointment. Tell him exactly how you‚Äôre feeling, good or bad. Most doctors start with the safest and least risky option. For ADHD that usually means Wellbutrin or Strattera. Give the Wellbutrin a try with an open mind. If it doesn‚Äôt work just tell him. A good doctor will know what to do. Give it a couple of months, and if you still aren‚Äôt any better at that point I would start looking for a new doctor."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,I initially took Wellbutrin for my ADHD as it does treat some of the symptoms. I also have anxiety so it was two birds with one stone kinda situation for me. It worked until it didn't. I've been on separate ADHD and anxiety meds since then.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Adhd is a dopamine deficit issue. Wellbutrin is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor. In those of us with Adhd, we have too many receptors stealing our dopamine before it crosses the neurotransmitters to be utilized. Wellbutrin takes the place of dopamine in some of these receptors so we can get the dopamine and function like humans. I‚Äôm doing much better on Wellbutrin with concerta as needed than I was on adderall every day! Don‚Äôt be discouraged!"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Wellbutrin is often Rxed as off-label ADHD treatment.  It definitely helps with mine. As well as Adderall, no? But a lot less hassle."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I had this happen to me when I tried to get back on ADD medication after several years because I was tired of struggling. I explained that I was originally diagnosed under 5 and took meds through most of high school with an extensive medical record to prove it. The Dr said that she didn‚Äôt see a problem because ‚ÄúI had a good job‚Äù, prescribing me Wellbutrin. 

I went to another doctor who screened me pretty quick, mostly asking about my childhood issues. I would seek another provider."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Don‚Äôt worry about it, if it works it‚Äôs fine. I was on that one for like 6-9 months"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I have an middle-age family member with fairly severe ADHD and anxiety who has been doing very well on Wellbutrin. I used to be very active on the now defunct ADDForums.com and got the sense from reading thousands of posts that Wellbutrin worked for a small subset of people with ADHD. But it is so well tolerated, and so much easier to get, I think it is absolutely worth a try."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,I am prescribed stimulants and also recently started taking Wellbutrin. The Wellbutrin has helped calm my brain down so much! I never want to stop taking it.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I see some people are already saying it so I'll just add on here that Wellbutrin is very often used as a first line treatment for ADHD and while it is also used for depression, (and smoking cessation too lol) it can be effective for ADHD for some people. It usually takes some time for it to actually have some effect, online it says normally 6-8 weeks for depression and for some positive effects can begin as soon as 1-2 weeks, so basically you won't know it's working or not for a bit yet. 

Just try it for a while, it may work for you or it doesn't and you can switch to something else later on. I tried it for a while and it worked really good for my mood and stuff but it did literally nothing for my ADHD symptoms so I decided to move onto stimulant meds, which actually do treat my symptoms. Don't be in too much of a rush, just try it for a bit and talk to your doc about how you feel. Honestly as far as ""antidepressants"" (even though it's not an SSRI like most antidepressants), Wellbutrin is actually not too hard at all to come off of and doesn't seem to cause tons of side effects, (at least for me and the bunch of people I know that have taken it)."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"You take the Welbutrin. It‚Äôs a common scrip for ADHD. Many doctors don‚Äôt want to prescribe stimulants these days. The unfortunate reality is you have to shop around for one who doesn‚Äôt automatically assume everyone looking for stimulant ADHD treatment is drug seeking. The irony is the fact this occurs causes people to appear drug seeking.

Furthermore, did you take an actual assessment and get a diagnosis? Without an actual assessment or diagnosis your chances of receiving a stimulant med is very low."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I'm currently unable to afford a diagnosis but my doctor and I are pretty sure I have adhd, but more prominently, anxiety. She put me on wellbutrin since it can help with both of those things, and it definitely has helped me in both areas. Perhaps not as much as a stimulant might, but I will just have to wait and see. I would suggest trying it for a while to see."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Seems like you‚Äôve gotten some helpful responses, OP, but I just wanted to add that my husband has been on Wellbutrin for some time for ADHD and it has been pretty great, minimal side effects, lots of benefits."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"If the Wellbutrin doesn't work, try to get a referral to a neuropsychologist for ADHD testing (if possible). This is is what I had to do before my PCP would prescribe stimulant meds."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Wellbutrin is v stimulating lol works just as good as ritalin if u ask me
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Depression isn‚Äôt just feeling sad. You could be depressed based on those symptoms you‚Äôve mentioned though
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I have seasonal depression and during winter welbutrin is awesone. I do take ritalin diring summer thought. I don't personally like to mix because it is too much for me. 
Also, doctors prescribe medecine that they know ! The therapist knows the effet and side effects of Welbutrin !"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I‚Äôm not going to read any of the other comments before writing mine. (Mostly because I saw the top comment say their ‚Äúadhd type‚Äù and that is outdated and dangerous)

I have had ADHD for YEARS undiagnosed. Got diagnosed at 26 and ignored that‚Ä¶ then finally started taking Ritalin a couple year ago. It was great. Depression and anxiety weren‚Äôt me. 

Last year, that changed. Why? A lot of reason but primarily, they are pretty close to guaranteed comorbidities to ADHD. And you may not even realize that you‚Äôre depressed or anxious‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs a bummer to. 

Anyway‚Ä¶ all of that to say that I started Wellbutrin a month ago after all the other anti-depressants I tried and I feel amazing. Medicine works differently for different people but it‚Äôs made me feel so balanced (when used with my Ritalin as prescribed). 

Wellbutrin is a beautiful start to your ADHD diagnosis. Embrace it, because of you really think you have ADHD‚Ä¶ that Wellbutrin will be a huge headstart"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Can you tell time? Do you regularly and intensely still remember, fret over, and get embarrassed by certain events years or even decades later?"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Wellbutrin is amazing for ADHD. It inhibits the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine which is what Adderall does (but Adderall also produces dopamine and norepinephrine).
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"wellbutrin is used off label for adhd very often. This is completely normal and doesn't require using illegal substances that require strict paperwork etc. 

And unlike stimulants they work most of the time instead of a very specific amount of hours per day. From my personal experience I'd pretty much always suggest a adhd person trying medication for the first time, should try wellbutrin first, it generally has very few side effects and a lot of positives."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I have ADHD and Wellbutrin has really helped me with my executive dysfunction, among other things. Because of my BP I cannot take regular stimulant ADHD meds at all, so Wellbutrin, which does act on the dopamine parts of the brain, CAN be helpful. I am on the ""high dose"" and it has made me functional again. I was literally lying in bed for an hour in the mornings, thirsty, hungry and having to pee SO BAD, and I literally couldn't get up. That's how bad it was. Now I can get up whenever I need to. I am still not ""well"" but it's markedly better. I say give the Wellbutrin a chance. It might help you, especially if you are a woman with estrogen problems."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"i was put on wellbutrin but it wasnt good for me. changed antidepressants, then i started noticing adhd symptoms in myself. i went back for my appointment and he confirmed for me that my depression masked my adhd, which is my normal self of course. he basically balanced my brain a bit before giving me stimulants. it made sense, and i dont think i would have had it any other way. hope this brings comfort to you!"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Welbutrin is sometimes used to treat mild cases of ADHD.
For mine it didnt work and made me throwup every morning. they kept saying ""give it time"" for a year. until I had enough and said no. they always gave me this ""you dont know what youre talking about"" attitude about my welbutrin prescription. I now have gum issues from it"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Symptoms of ADHD cause despressive episodes or depression as a full diagnosis. The chemical imbalance in the brain that goes along with ADHD causes symptoms of depression (unmotivated, lazy, sadness, etc.)."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Don‚Äôt worry, I was first put on Wellbutrin as well when I first got a psych evaluation. My psychiatrist suspected I has ADHD, but was presenting symptoms of depression which were actually caused by it. II am now on Vyvanse and Wellbutrin which help a ton."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I have had adhd for years, since I was 10 or so.  I'm 37 now. I've been on Ritalin, Adderall, and Strattera. The stimulants make me 'aggressive', Strattera works... Sort of. I just started talking wellbutrin Monday. So far, it's been great. Really working well for me."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Sometimes low dosage antidepressants do the job. You‚Äôre not being described for depression - it‚Äôs just a better option without having to use stimulants. Definitely give it a shot.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"You are assuming that the only use for wellbrutrin is depression. Which is incorrect.  Wellbrutrin is used for several things including treating ADHD.


Wellbrutrin helps increase the dopamine in your system.

Low dopamine affects ADHD.

Taking wellbrutrin is an early intervention for ADHD.

You are getting the treatment you need.

By the way,  adhd are co-morbid to each other.   If you have ADHD there is a higher chance you have depression, and you might not realize it. 

Please trust the medical professionals."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I would absolutely tell your provider that you feel that they didn't hear your concerns about the ADHD and that you don't feel depressed/need an antidepressant. 

I know Wellbutrin is used off-label to treat ADHD as well, which is one of the reasons I asked to try it in combination with my stimulant, but I had a bad reaction to it myself. 

Stimulants are the first-line of treatment for ADHD and I believe should be tried first when someone is diagnosed. 

If this provider won't hear your concerns then maybe it is time to seek a second opinion. Unfortunately there are some psychiatrists that just don't believe in diagnosing adults with ADHD. I personally saw a psychiatrist (after being diagnosed with ADHD) and he told me he didn't believe I had ADHD (mind you I was on meds) so I moved on to another provider."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I'm sure someone else has said this, but Wellbutrin is a NDRI which means it acts on the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine. ADHD can be treated by providing more dopamine, so Wellbutrin can be used to treat both ADHD and depression. I'm actually taking Wellbutrin for both of those reasons, a sort of two birds one stone kinda deal lol"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,My psychologist told me there are new studies that show Wellbutrin does nothing for ADHD. Find those studies and present them to your doctor and ask for a stimulant.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I have OCD and ADHD (inattentive type).  My dr put me on Zoloft first to get me kind of stabilized, then when I was adjusted to that, she prescribed the quick release Wellbutrin.  It was a trashfire.  She told me, ""Put it directly in the trashcan.  We won't be doing that again."" And upped my Zoloft.  Now that I'm adjusted to the new dose, we're going to try a stimulant after my next appointment.  Wellbutrin seems to be a pretty common first try medicine."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Wellbutrin is used off label to treat ADHD because it‚Äôs a stimulant. I was put on it initially while I was awaiting my official diagnosis. For me personally, it did improve my symptoms but not as much as being on adderall does."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I do have pretty bad depression and when I got ADHD diagnosis, my doc explained that starting people on Wellbutrin is usually because it can be bumped to a high dose for ADHD and, in some cases, is a cheaper option than the ADHD meds.


Don't despair. It's weird, but just like we can't put one type of antidepressant in the water and make everyone better, same with ADHD meds. I am currently on addy and the high dose of it. If this doesn't keep working, I will have to switch to a different type. It'll suck, but it's always a slow process in finding what will actually work."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I'm on Wellbutrin too! As far as I've been told as of getting my prescription, it can actually help with some off the aspects of ADHD, namely focus. (I think) personally it's helped me a bit, so I'd say stick with it to see how it goes. If it works it works, if not, ask about another option. And I understand the struggle of your psychiatrist immediately dismissing an ADHD diagnosis. Mine did too. It's a struggle and a half, just gotta keep pushing along."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I have depression and anxiety alongside my ADHD (I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs because of my ADHD persay, just happens to be comorbid in my case) and my psychiatrist is treating the depression/anxiety first. Apparently if they diagnose a person with moderate-severe depression or anxiety most psychiatrists treat that first (which is probably not as effective for people whose depression is a result of ADHD I‚Äôd imagine). I was on a low dose of Wellbutrin to start so I don‚Äôt think that did too much for anything so they added Effexor for depression/anxiety for the time being. A stimulant might be added once it‚Äôs better controlled. Wellbutrin works great for many with ADHD apparently because it boosts dopamine but it‚Äôs probably not the cure all for me personally."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I also take Wellbutrin for ADHD. Just about every medication has several uses. I think Wellbutrin helps people with ADHD and people with depression because both tend to share a deficit in dopamine. As for your doctor, I notice a lot that most ordinary medical doctors don‚Äôt understand mental disorders very well. I suggest a psychiatric evaluation to get the diagnosis you need. Help from a psychiatrist and a therapist go much farther than just a regular doctor."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Three years ago when I went to a psychiatrist I told her I wanted to be able to get out of bed and focus on something for more than 10 minutes at a time. She prescribed Wellbutrin. It helped so much. Two years later I got diagnosed with adhd and started a stimulant. Now I‚Äôm adjusting my meds and stopping the Wellbutrin because I get the motivation and focus help from the stimulant. Wellbutrin is more gentle than my stimulants. I‚Äôm no doctor and I don‚Äôt know your specifics of course but Wellbutrin is probably a good place to start. I don‚Äôt think your doc was blowing you off. Good luck with everything ‚ù§Ô∏è
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Wellbutrin is actually prescribed for adhd. I‚Äôd give it a chance.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Wellbutrin is an ‚Ä¶ unusual drug. It does help with ADHD. And mood. And energy. It was part of my dosing schedule until very recently. It‚Äôs useful. Try it.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"OP, for myself I didn't start with Psychiatry, but rather with a psychologigist. Had them do a history, clinical eval, continuous attention test, and personality testing. Those in hand, I then scheduled with a psychiatrist. And have indeed been very, very lucky to be able to partner with a supportive provider.

I initially tried Vyvanse, which was quite good for me, but switched to Jornay PM in the hopea that it would forestall morning ADHD brain; unfortunately, Methylphenidate just isn't as effective for me as Vyvanse. Now I'm back, and at 70mg/day. In addition, I had my doc prescribe Clonidine .1mg to prevent any stimulant emotional dampening effects and to better activate the anterior cingulate cortex. So stimulant+ alpha2 agonist for me."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"If it makes you feel better Wellbutrin is used off-label for ADHD because it works on dopamine receptors a bit. Some people are on wellbutrin and a stimulant so personally I don't think it's a bad place to start.

I say let it play out and rise in dose a bit. Then decide if it helps or not. Personally Wellbutrin alone made me think more logically and helped arrange my thoughts a little more so i wasnt so scatterbrained. (I have ADHD)"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Wellbutrin can also help with ADHD. Different meds work for different people. Worth trying.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Wellbutrin is where they started me when I raised concerns I thought I had ADHD. it helped my depression but didn‚Äôt help the ADHD. 12 years later and I just got diagnosed in Nov last year and put on stimulants.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"This happened to me too. When I'd first met with the first couple of psych doctors I went to they'd always start off with questions about like my childhood and how I did in school and all that. They assumed that since I didn't start really struggling in school until I was in about 8th grade and on then I couldn't have ADHD since according to DSM-5 (basically a big diagnostic rule book for metal health) symptoms must be present before age 12, which I had the symptoms prior to age 12 I just didn't actually start struggling until my teen years. And I'm also assuming when I told them about my childhood and all the stuff I've been through I feel like they'd be like wow this girl must be depressed who wouldn't be and then just assume it was depression. 

My first doctor that prescribed the Wellbutrin basically told me that if I really had ADHD then the Wellbutrin would work for it, as if it was a one size fits all. It just didn't do anything for me. You might need to try finding another doctor if the Wellbutrin doesn't work for you. I wish you luck!"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Udyejw
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Oh! I had a really really good psych who was amazing IMO at making sure I advocated for myself (like if I looked unsure or anything she would double check and make it clear she wanted me to be part of finding a treatment too so if I had any concerns or reservations she was more that happy to hear them and adjust accordingly)

1) you can always ask how it‚Äôs supposed to work. Like what does this do and should that theoretically treat your symptoms. 

Ex. For a time I was on propanol (which is like a heart medication) for my anxiety. It slows your heart rate. Anxiety -> increase heart rate -> makes you more anxious. Medication would slow it down -> brain going ‚Äúoh panic is over‚Äù. Or something to that effect

2) keep track of symptoms/side effects. She told me do it at different times for each you take (so say Monday morning dose -> 2h after taking. Afternoon dose -> 4h. Next morning-> 3h. It‚Äôs arbitrary really. Just as long as diff times and diff doses per entry) funny thing is if the meds are working it‚Äôs easier to remember to keep track

3) SIDE EFFECTS MATTER. Sure dry throat is sucky but meh. You feeling super jittery? Crashing when the meds wear off? Meds could be amazing, side effects to that degree are not worth it

4) THIS ONE ABOVE ALL ELSE: DO THE MEDS HELP ALL YOUR SYMPTOMS. This one she pushed me on the most. There are so many different options or even combos. Everyone is different. The goal is working together to see what you need. As she put it ‚ÄúAll the meds are going to have side effects. That‚Äôs just how that works. If you‚Äôre going to have to deal with side effects (no matter how minor) the LEAST this can do is actually treat all your symptoms‚Äù

Your meds should help with motivation(I need to do the thing. I‚Äôm gonna go do it), focus (I think that‚Äôs‚Ä¶obvious), memory, even things like anxiety or panic attacks (if you were prone to them like me) bc ADHD can actually make those thought spirals‚Ä¶.sooo much worse. Anything ADHD your meds should have an effect. If you skip a day and it doesn‚Äôt feel that much different (not saying you can‚Äôt go without. I skip days when I know I have like a free day where it‚Äôs okay if I do next to nothing productive) that‚Äôs probably not the meds you should be taking

Also complete aside if you have a menstrual cycle, that can actually affect your symptoms. They get worse on your period so they may need to be adjusted accordingly for that week

Moved states so don‚Äôt have her anymore sadly but god her advice while I did has been so darn helpful"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"My doctor had me try 450mg of Wellbutrin XL, insisting it would help my symptoms, but it‚Äôs not helping at all. Currently switching doctors so I can try a stimulant"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Wellbutrin is commonly prescribed for depression, anxiety, smoking cessation, SAD, and ADHD. When prescribed for ADHD, it's technically an off-label use, but it's really common because it works.

Wellbutrin is not an SSRI, or an MAOI, and it works differently than a traditional antidepressant. Wellbutrin inhibits the re-uptake of key neurotransmitters that affect mood, focus, and executive function; specifically dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. 

Because it helps these key neurotransmitters you produce last longer in your system, it's very effective at balancing mood, improving impulse control, and alleviating ""brain fog"". It's also very well tolerated by most people and has very few side effects, so doctors often start with Wellbutrin to treat the above conditions because it's a relatively gentle option and it's effective. 

Honestly, Wellbutrin (bupropion) is one of the best drugs since penicillin and it's a godsend for many people.

Be advised that the first month on Wellbutrin usually shows small improvements, but nothing mind-blowing. In the second month, many people experience a plateau and feel like the Wellbutrin isn't doing much. This is when people are likely to ask their doctor for a higher dosago and end up taking a dose that makes them feel crazy. They then decide that Wellbutrin doesn't work for them and quit. Don't do that. Wait until month 3 to get acclimated to the drug. That third month is when you really start to see big, positive impacts from the Wellbutrin and hit a stride with it. So give it time to do it's thing.

Your doctor made a good choice starting you on Wellbutrin, no need to worry!"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Wellbutrin is great for my ADHD! Give it a chance.

What do I do?,"I'm currently on it, it's worked well for me (when I remember to take it üòÖ) and it's been almost a year. I was unsure about it too when I first started, but if your doc is telling you that you have something when you don't think you do, get a second opinion. You know yourself and your own symptoms better than anyone else will."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"This happened to me, wellbutrin is designed to treat ADHD and Depression in tandem.

Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Wellbutrin is one of the first line medications they fry because it‚Äôs relatively safe, and the addiction potential is lower.

Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I thin alot of times its prescribed for people who are trying to handle the effects of ADHD on their lives, it works for ADHD as well as depression. In highschool when i was in a massive hole of procrastination and self loathing because of my ADHD my doc prescribed to help alleviate the depression symptoms cause by the effects of ADHD on my life"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,I heard that welbutrin is supposed to help with adhd. It's an option for those who can't be on stimulant type medication.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Did he actually do the ADHD testing or just verbal consult. Ask to do the actual testing. It‚Äôs just a series of questions and if you score above ‚Äòx‚Äô you likely have adhd. I‚Äôd start there.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"This is common. The THEORY is they're not working on depression necessarily, they are working on the mood alterations to see if a more minor (uhhh wellbutrin tho jfc) medication would work better.

I had to try depression and ptsd meds before I was allowed my ritalin. I'm still on the former two as well. Turns out I had all three. Whoops.

I still fucking hate it and its so gatekeepy when you LIVE WITH ADHD SO YOU KINDA FUCKING KNOW YOU HAVE IT.
Edit: thought I should add tho it was totally worth it. The ptsd meds are a fucking heaven sent."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"That particular drug is a recognised treatment for ADHD. If it doesn't work then you need a different one, but the doctor is not crazy."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Hi! I went to see a doctor for similar symptoms plus other stuff with a suspicion that I had depression AND ADHD. He put me on Wellbutrin and told me it's used for both depression and ADHD but didn't really specify how it would help me. I did some research and found out that Wellbutrin is often used for those with both depression and ADHD. 

I've been on it since November 2021 and I can't say that it's a miracle but I do find it a lot easier to make decisions and to get the motivation or just the switch in my brain to allow me to move and do things. It's also made me more alert and just... focused on what's around me. Not perfect because some ADHD/Depression stuff is still very much there and debilitating but it's better than nothing.

Wellbutrin is great just because it's consistent and you almost don't feel it working. I don't have to worry about it wearing off or I don't need to take it in the morning so I can still work and do stuff. It just works. Always. 

I would wait at least 2-3 months before deciding if you want off it or not. Give your body a chance to get used to it."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I wish I (inattentive adhd) could say the same as most here, but Wellbutrin absolutely messed me up. It gave me night twitches that eventually became all day random convulsions, and severely increased my anxiety. I do hope it helps you, truly. Just keep an eye out for side effects, as you always should with any anti-depressants."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Some doctors won‚Äôt go the stimulant route at first if they don‚Äôt have enough time to manage the medication because it‚Äôs a controlled drug. I can only get 3 refills of stimulants before I have to be seen again and the appointments take longer. This may be state specific though. But I am sure there are dozens of other reasons why they would prescribe a non stimulant first. I believe Wellbutrin is the most common stimulant alternative.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I'm in the same exact boat as you are and they started me off on 150mg and I felt nothing so they upped it to 300mg . I still don't feel shit so I'm hoping they move me to the real meds. , not this anti depression shit."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Bupropion is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor. It is one of the primary treatments for people with ADHD, both combined with a stimulant and by itself.

Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I wish i had advice but unfortunately i had something very similar happen.
I'm 46f and was diagnosed ADHD in early 80's as a kid. Recently sought out a Psych appointment because im majorly burnt out at work after traveling working Covid the last 2 years. I mentioned I think im Autistic and that I may have CPTSD.  She basically said im not ADHD or Autistic and all of ny symptoms are from anxiety and depression. She wanted me to try beta blockers. I politely refused."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I've tried so many combinations of anti-depressants paired with my ADHD meds to the point that I don't specifically remember which medication made my feel better/worse. But I do remember being on Wellbutrin for quite a while and it took around a month or so for me to notice some improvements so try to give it some time to kick in and then re-access. Hopefully it gives you some positive results without unmanageable side-effects!
Not trying to sound like a dick, but the symptoms you mentioned could be more related to a depressive diagnosis.  

My prescriber encourages me to try to take a circumstantial look at my emotional state and it does help out from time to time so now I recommend it to many people. 

Ex: Am I actually a lazy depressed pos or am I maybe just a little more burnt out from work/life + grad school. Still unsure but hey ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"

What do I do?,"adderall is the ONLY thing that helps. i eat, sleep, and regulate my mood MUCH better on it. i was just prescribed wellbutrin cause i moved states and getting an in-person psych visit takes months. well long story short, the wellbutrin made me LITERALLY feel like i was gonna die and made everything waaaaaay worse. 

Like, am i depressed and anxious? yea, cause i dont have my f***ing meds and have a disability"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Low key I‚Äôm jealous bc I‚Äôm on a combo of vyvanse and antidepressants and I‚Äôd rather just take Wellbutrin. I‚Äôve heard great things
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"It may not have been written off. PTSD  and be confused with adhd. Do you have a history of trauma? I‚Äôve got PTSD myself, so if you have any questions hit me up."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Wellbutrin is actually a really great treatment for adhd and it helps motivation. I‚Äôve been taking it for about 4 months now to treat adhd & depression & it literally changed me completely. Before I started taking it I was barely functioning. I wouldn‚Äôt write it off so quick. I‚Äôm sorry your doctor didn‚Äôt diagnose you properly but let me tell you, wellbutrin is a miracle drug for adhd! (At least in my case) after the initial side effects subsided for me (which weren‚Äôt too bad) i‚Äôve never had issues with anything like anxiety or high blood pressure etc that adderall can cause. You should totally give it a chance."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,My doctor started me on Wellbutrin for anxiety but it just felt numbing. A year later I got a adhd diagnosis and also started Vyvanse.. phased out the Wellbutrin after realizing it was adhd causing the anxiety. Feel great now.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I think antidepressants could help with some symptoms, but you're right I'm not sure if that's gonna get to the root of the issue. Who knows tho, depending on everybody's varied body types, some people might find a lot of help for adhd on wellbutrin and get no help/bad side effects from adderal or a similar medication. Some people don't respond to most mental meds barely at all, and they may use specific vitamins or meds that don't affect the brain in the same way.

Source: I got diagnosed with depression and anxiety before realizing it's possible to have adhd or even asking wether I had it or not. Went through like 3 meds plus an anxiety med, then got diagnosed. Got on aderall and it's actually working. Did a gene test later and found out I have some gene that means I don't respond that well to SSRI's and I don't metabolize some things well, making even the non-ssri depression med I tried need a higher dose. It's different for everyone"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Wellbutrin is also commonly prescribed to people with ADHD. It's also used for certain eating disorders. It's a bit different from SSRIs like prozac; it affects dopamine and norepinephrine instead.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,I was prescribed. Not as productive as I was on addy or even Ritalin (and I fucking hated Ritalin) but it was still noticeably effective to some degree. It helped with my motivation but I still had that scatterbrained unfocused feeling. It also made me quit vaping lol.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I had a rough time during Quarantine and thought it was time to consider Antidepressants to get through the day- Started on one (an SSRI). it wasn't a great fit for me- I talked to my Dr. and we went over to Bupropion, and suddenly I noticed improvements that I didn't even realize could be better, if that makes sense? 

annnnd that's around when I realized I should get tested for Adhd well into my Adulthood. 

but about the Wellbutrin- I fell down a hole on wikipedia to try and educate myself- and A lot of drugs are used for more than one purpose, and Bupropion for ex. is helpful for Adhd, Parkinsons, and sometimes in short doses to help quit smoking!

If you feel good- that's all that matters!"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Wellbutrin is used as an off-label treatment for ADHD. I‚Äôve been on it since the beginning of the year, and I have had significant symptom improvement. But also, after also working with a psychologist for the last 6 months who specializes in adults with adhd, and in her opinion the Wellbutrin has helped me significantly, but a stimulant may help optimize me. I haven‚Äôt tried stimulants yet. But I am a fan of the Wellbutrin so far. I may do a combination in the near future, but I appreciate the base I‚Äôm at right now"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Medication is funny. I have ADHD, anxiety and depression, and Vyvanse helps with all of them (maybe in part due to my anxiety and depression being caused by ADHD). In my country, Australia, Vyvanse is the only medication used to treat binge eating (I think). Weird how an ADHD medication can be used to treat something that is very unrelated to ADHD. I dislike Vyvanse because it gives me appetite issues, so I have to binge eat at night to get my required calories (ironic isn't it?), but it gets the job done."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Hey OP, stick with it, and give the meds a chance. I did the same thing a few years ago. I went in to get an  official ADHD diagnosis, and then work out a treatment plan. They instead started me on wellbutrin and an anti-anxiety. It helped for them to rule out how much of my symptoms were ADHD and how much was its own separate ball of anxiety. I remember feeling so frustrated and not fully listened to. But once the meds had a chance to do what they were meant to do, my doc then was open to starting ADHD meds. 

Keep with it, always be open with your doc on it you feel your meds are working. It's okay to say they aren't doing anything for you."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Therapy>psychiatry
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Wellbutrin is well-known as an off-label ADHD treatment. If you can tolerate it it has the bonus of also helping to control the depression that often accompanies untreated ADHD, and doesn‚Äôt generally cause unwanted weight gain like most SSRIs. It also may boost libido in some folks ‚Äînot a reason to take it but I found it a nice bonus when I was on it."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Try it, I have depression due to low dopamine levels, I tried and hated it, made me really nervous. (It has stimulant propietes)

My doctor switched me to provigil that I tolerate better. They just start prescribing you the less addictive stuff first, that's it. 

If it doesn't work for you, make them know and If yoy are lucky they can put you in adderal or provigil"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,I'm not sure if it is Wellbutrin but some antidepressants are also used to treat ADHD.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"meds aside- your doctor doesn‚Äôt seem to be listening to you. i encourage you to bring up your concerns, self advocacy and being firm about your own treatment can make a huge difference. i wish i stood up for myself when my symptoms were dismissed."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Wellbutrin can help with ADHD and I personally was prescribed it for anxiety and not my depression. I take Lexapro(escitalopram) for that
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Went through the same thing, it took a year for a diagnosis.

 1st fund a doctor that specializes in adhd. If they say you don't have it, they are probably right. Most other doctors tend to over look it.

2nd, wellbutrin is an antidepressant, but it's also used to help smokers stop smoking, and help treat adhd for those who can't take stimulants. I was put on it at first. They suck. I couldn't sleep, and they did nothing for my adhd. I did stop smoking so that was a plus. Meds effect everyone differently, so it might be worth a try to start with. 

Good luck with your search to peace."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Well if you weren‚Äôt depressed before, you probably are now after waiting months just to be let down."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I started Wellbutrin a few months ago and initially had your concerns and was hoping I would get prescribed stimulants. Cue to now, I am much much happier we tried this first, because while not perfect, the Wellbutrin has helped me immensely."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I was diagnosed because of wellbutrin. I was depressed and prescribed wellbutrin but it did not agree with my digestive system. After I was taken off of it, I was at a loss. I couldn't focus or do anything productive anymore. I was very confused and generally out of it. I didn't know what was wrong. My therapist and psychologist, together, figured it out. They tested me and I turned out ADHD inattentive type. The wellbutrin had treated my adhd symptoms without us knowing. This caused all of the coping mechanisms I had developed since childhood to circumvent my unknown adhd to fad away as I no longer needed them. It was nuts."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Some doctors are too lazy to prescribe stimulants since it requires a few more steps. That said, Wellbutrin can help se with symptoms of ADD/ADHD."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Well I wasn‚Äôt depressed either, was given it for adhd, I think it‚Äôs great"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,I take Wellbutrin too (in combination with a few others). Not uncommon as second line medications particularly if there is a concern about stimulants or if they aren‚Äôt effective.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Wellbutrin treats ADHD. it's off label but it raises dopamine levels. Works a treat for many people.

But not me, I have to take stimulants."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Stick with the medication for now, report your experience with your psych at your follow-up or refill appointment. Call them back sooner if the meds make you feel worse. Often with specialists getting the initial appointment takes months but then you do get regular follow-ups with them, ask at your next appointment if they don‚Äôt bring it up. ‚ÄúWhen is the next time I should see you?‚Äù They might just want to see if they can stabilize any mood/anxiety that might be causing your symptoms."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Same with me! I‚Äôm not depressed either, it was a first attempt at addressing ADHD. I felt it really helped my mood, actually!"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I have run into the brick wall of Mental Health personnel who truly avoid ADHD as a diagnosis and try to blame the symptoms of ADHD on depression and complex PTSD. The main advice I can give you is to keep shopping around for a facility that takes ADHD seriously.    
P.S. Wellbutrin is one of the few non-stimulant drugs approved for ADHD. It helped me some what, but I couldn't tolerate the headaches it gave me. I think it's worth a try for you."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Yeah I started taking Wellbutrin and since it didn‚Äôt help we kept upping the dosage until I was taking about 600mg a day, and my doctor refused to prescribe me more bc I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù and at that time I was tiny. It was actually the trigger that convinced him to send me to get a full ADHD evaluation and formal diagnosis, and I‚Äôve been taking Adderall and Pristiq to manage myself in a pretty nice little regimen that took five years to get right."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"It‚Äôs a flip flop. For me the stimulants work, but 10 years ago they didn‚Äôt. Antidepressants helped then but they don‚Äôt now. Sometimes exploration is the only way! Just listen to the doctors prescription and report back, it‚Äôs safest that way."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"my doc is wanting to try this for me, as we are looking for a non stimulant for me for several reasons... keep us posted. I've heard it's a great overall drug."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I was on Wellbutrin for a time for depression, and I didn‚Äôt think it helped my ADHD.  I was glad to be off it.  But in my reading about the drug when I started it, I found many people to have different experiences.  You should see for yourself how it makes you feel before you decide.  You should know though, that the first week or two will be very different.  Once you get used to it, you‚Äôll know how it feels.  But that first week was crazy.  I couldn‚Äôt listen to someone talking directly to me.  So  don‚Äôt judge it too quickly.  Hope it works out for you!"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Many docs are uncomfortable starting with stimulants, usually start with Wellbutrin because it‚Äôs had limited success off label, then Straterra, then stimulants"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Wellbutrin is a drug that helps with norepinephrine release, which is basically what ADHD is: a misfiring of norepinephrine. Wellbutrin is used off-label to treat ADHD. Your Dr may be taking the non-stimulant route first, or maybe seeing if all the symptoms go away with an anti-depressant. Unfortunately psychiatry is basically let's-throw-this-at-your-symptoms-and-see-what-happens, but be persistent! If you don't think the Wellbutrin is helping your ADHD, push harder for it, or push for a referral from your doctor to a psychiatrist who specialises in ADHD."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I‚Äôm on 400 mg of Wellbutrin. It‚Äôll take about 6-8weeks to see the improvement. I‚Äôm 54 and in great health but my psychiatrist said adderall can cause heart issues in people over 50. (And I had a friend in oz confirm. He too is healthy and fit but he told me he has some sort of permanent issue with his heart because of the adderall). 

I‚Äôm not depressed either although I was already taking 200 mg (for reasons) at the suggestion of my PCP. Psychiatrist just upped it. 

I‚Äôm less scattered now. It‚Äôs not perfect. I‚Äôd probably get a better result with a stimulant (I know how my brain responds to stimulants) but it‚Äôs a reasonable compromise."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Bupropion has off label benefits for adhd. It is often tried out as a non stimulant option.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Wellbutrin is awesome for adhd -changed my life- much steadier and more even keeled then when I too stimulants.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"My psych says if I take my adderall 3x a day as prescribed, I won‚Äôt need an anti-depressant. He is right. 13 years same dose and the way I know I didn‚Äôt take my adderall is that my mood seems to turn kind of crappy and I‚Äôm tired. Taken my medicine, no high feeling, just everything is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and actually way more calm than without my medicine."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Try your meds 1st your doctor knows better.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Wellbutrin has been life changing for my ADHD. It‚Äôs turned the static in my head down to near nonexistent.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,You literally got the drug that I want to try for mine...
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Wellbutrin is what I take for adhd and depression, it‚Äôs a nice drug, and it gets prescribed for all kinds of things- it‚Äôs not an ssri, it works on dopamine, and low dopamine in the frontal lobe is associated with adhd, addiction and depression. And the side effects are all pretty mild compared to a lot of adhd meds- I‚Äôm not your doctor, but anecdotally, I‚Äôd say, give it a shot! It helped me so much I got the molecule tattooed on me. It might not be strong enough to manage your adhd, but it‚Äôs a place to start. 

And I know how disheartening it can be to feel written off- it‚Äôs such a real thing in the medical system, but like, they don‚Äôt have a better method then throwing different stuff at you till something sticks. If this doesn‚Äôt make your adhd any better, it‚Äôs at least, one option to cross off the list."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Wellbutrin is commonly used to treat ADHD too
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I recently did genesight to see what other meds would work for my depression and anxiety (I have ADHD inattention also). I‚Äôve been on Wellbutrin for years but thought maybe there‚Äôs something better. Tried Cymbalta ‚Äî that made me feel like shit. Head pressure, nausea, brain fog, mood swings, every once in awhile I think I see something move out of the corner of my eye‚Ä¶ I was only on it for a week and a half. I stopped taking it after that then I saw a lot of messed up sht here and other places and knew I made the right decision. 

I‚Äôm back on Wellbutrin now and it‚Äôs such a huge difference between nothing vs cymbalta. No more mood swings. No ADHD brain. I was miserable on cymbalta and miserable not taking Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm prescribed Adderall as well and some days the Wellbutrin does more for me than the Adderall. But sleeping is definitely an issue at times due to anxiety and the meds so Lorazepam as needed helps there.

Many medications can address symptoms it‚Äôs not marketed for. Try to trust the doctor and give it some time and really pay attention to before and after. Write it down if you can. Sometimes when we take meds we just expect them to work but we don‚Äôt always have an idea of what ‚Äúwork‚Äù actually means. It‚Äôs not like popping an ibuprofen knowing your headache will go away. You have to figure out what it does for you, what it doesn‚Äôt and match that with your overall goal of how you want to tackle your ADHD. Everyone is different. Some of us are just fine starting 50 things and maybe finishing half of them because it‚Äôs not detrimental. Others not so much.  

Good luck though. A lot of yucky shit out there they‚Äôre willing to give us ‚Äî many having long term or permanent side effects. Wellbutrin is about as clean as I can imagine. Hope it works out for you."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,I was recently put on Wellbutrin and I think it may be changing my life.   I had a bad experience with other meds for ADHD so my doctor gave me this as an alternative.  Wish I had tried years ago.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,I know people with EDS that are on it for the anti inflammatory as well as the energy benefits. It‚Äôs actually pretty common.

Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Wellbutrin is not just for depression, it is commonly used for ADHD"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I'm not depressed either and I'm also on wellbutrin. I suffer from PTSD and daily panic attacks and so wellbutrin has been suppressing those panic attacks and it's been helping my ADHD as well. 

My psychiatrist has been trying to get me off my dexamphetamine, but I'm not sure I want to, I like using a small dose when I go to work. 

Sometimes it takes a bit of trying different meds to find what works for you, best of luck"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"My doc tried welbutrin with me. He thought that my ADHD wasn‚Äôt really ADHD, but a side effect of depression due to losing my dad a few months prior. I stopped being sad because it made me so angry all the time. Like, rip a door off the hinges angry. Only managed to stay on it for like 2 months. Alternatively, my girlfriend was on it for the longest time and it helped her more than anything else."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"So for me. 

The wellbutrin is used in conjunction with the adhd meds. The wellbutrin targeted my lethargy and depressive symptoms, the adhd meds gave me the boost I needed to actually function beyond ""i don't feel like k*lling myself"".

So only being on the antidepressants actually revealed my adhd symptoms more clearly. So maybe it would help in that way."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Just try it out. A lot of this is just trying out different meds with your doctor and seeing which ones work better. Your doctor probably wants to see if there are non controlled options that work first. If wellbutrin doesn't work just let them know.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,I can‚Äôt take stimulants because of a heart condition so I have been put on Wellbutrin. It‚Äôs an off label treatment for adhd.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Wellbutrin is a drug that has a lot of uses, including supporting smoking cessation, depression and adhd. Maybe see how/if it works for you and go from there."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Your psychiatrist is targeting specific neurotransmitters, as opposed to a diagnosis of depression.  They may also be moving you slowly along a medication route, adding one thing in at a time, monitoring your response.  I was diagnosed 15 years ago and put on Wellbutrin and a stimulant."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Wellbutrin gave me a permanent ear ring after 2 weeks on it. If your ears start to hurt talk to your doctor about stopping it, don‚Äôt try and wait it out. My doctor kept telling me it would go away, it never did."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I had a similar thing happen, went in hoping for adhd and got adhd + depression (to be fair I was definitely depressed too). They put me on Wellbutrin for a month bc depression is a more serious condition, but after that I was able to start adhd meds. My doctors for some reason seemed weirdly withholding when talking about the diagnosis, so I wasn‚Äôt even sure it was a legit diagnosis until I straight up asked, so make sure you get all the info from the psychiatrist that you can. Best of luck! (Also I stopped Wellbutrin recently, the combo washed me out emotionally)"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Don‚Äôt take it ‚Ä¶ if you go to a different  doctor they can give you complete diagnosis.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Two things. First it's hard to diagnose yourself. Second, Wellbutrin is used off-label for ADHD.  Give it a go and see if it helps. Personally it didn't work for me but maybe you will be different."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Wellbutrin is used to treat ADHD.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"It doesn‚Äôt have to be for depression, I took it for about a year then stopped, made me sleep much better, made food more enjoyable for me. I actually gained weight on it despite there being a common suppressing appetite side effect , it also raised my blood pressure too much. I never noticed any energy or focus effect, nothing compared to Adderall or Ritalin anyway. Never made me extremely happy or extremely sad, I was kept in a ‚Äúmedium‚Äù between the two. The benefits weren‚Äôt that beneficial then switched to Ritalin then adderall. My blood pressure is actually lower on adderall than Wellbutrin, body feels a bit better. Core differences is that adderall and Ritalin worked much better for focusing obviously them being a stimulant, keeps you awake and keeps your appetite suppressed. Adderall / Ritalin would also give me insomnia, anxiety, irritable, angry while Wellbutrin was more of a ‚Äúbalance‚Äù. I‚Äôd say Wellbutrin overall is the healthier choice, more versatile and good if you do have some depression issues, wanna quit smoking, or need a stronger libido. I didn‚Äôt find it to help much or at all with add symptoms."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,This gives me hope! Thanks.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Yep! Unlike most anti-depressants, Wellbutrin acts on dopamine, so it can be quite useful for ADHD. 

I was on stimulants for 20 years, and have transitioned to just Wellbutrin. I prefer it. Stimulants do help with my symptoms, but they come at a cost to my mood and physical wellbeing. It's one of those things each individual has to weigh (and everyone probably responds a little differently)."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Same here. Wellbutrin has been the best so far. Stimulants‚Ä¶..never again. Always on edge and a jerk if I‚Äôm honest
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"How long have you been on Wellbutrin if you don't mind me asking?
I hear there can be some tolerance with it as with any other medication"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,This! Bupropion eliminated my time blindness and helped me be an overall functioning person.

Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Interesting, what was your experience with stims like? I‚Äôm on my third stimulant and it doesn‚Äôt seem to be helping much."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I am not diagnosed but am also inattentive type and when I was going to college my doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin saying it would help me concentrate at school and it def worked!

Will probably request Wellbutrin when I finally do see a doctor again."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"(ADHD inattentive) (also have depression)

Personally, Wellbutrin/Bupropion did shit for me. And I have a proven 55% deficiency in dopamine. So while it may work for OP, they shouldn‚Äôt expect that it definitely will"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Thanks for this!
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Wellbutrin in particular can be helpful for those with ADHD because it is mildly stimulating.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I have a somewhat similar experience. I strongly suspected ADHD myself and thought it was a done deal. Apparently my symptoms were all over the place and the psych put me on sertraline which helped a lot with depression and anxiety.
It really helped a lot and in fact I think my ADHD symptoms have become more pronounced now. I still struggle with concentration and structure but I'm  not such a big mess atm, which allows the psych to get a clearer picture.
Unless the doctor is being downright mean or rude to you my best advice is to trust the process and let the professionals set the direction. Of course you are still allowed to give your input and thought, as a matter of fact the doctor should encourage it. 
I wish you the best."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Just want to point out that Strattera is used to treat ADHD. It is not generally prescribed purely as an antidepressant.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I experienced the same exact thing as OP where I was placed on Wellbutrin upon my initial diagnosis. I was on Wellbutrin for a couple of years and slept so much during that time and my psychiatrist attributed it to depression so he increased my dose which made me even more tired, and I did not realize the cause of my tiredness was the Wellbutrin until I got a new therapist and she pointed out that sometimes these meds can have that effect on some people. I lowered the Wellbutrin dose and I am on an ADHD medication and an anxiety medication as well, due to co-morbid disorders I have. Only until the ADHD medication was added did I start to feel much, much better. I just wanted to share my experience just so that someone else doesn‚Äôt have to go through what I went through! So if any medication has undesirable adverse side effects, don‚Äôt be afraid to let your doctor know!"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Exactly. Let‚Äôs get those chemicals balanced out, get you back from a place of distress, then see what‚Äôs under the hood. I think it‚Äôs better than handing over a bottle of Ritalin on the first visit."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Same same! Zoloft because anxiety and they helped alot with the anxiety but then the adhd kicked into high gear and that's when I knew it was both adhd and anxiety and depression weee.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,I have been taking Zoloft and am starting Straterra this week. I‚Äôm glad to hear the combo is helping. I am newly diagnosed ADHD and I‚Äôm really hoping meds will help.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Strattera also happens to be one of the few non-stimulant ADHD meds, so this is probably why it's specifically helping you.

Of course anxiety itself can characterized as an executive function issue and for a long time my issue was put into that.  

Venlaxafine, and welbutrin impact norepinephrine and dopamine (very weakly in the case of venlax) so among the antidepressants they can affect ADHD symptoms.  Oddly my best combo was venlaxafine and seroquel.  Made me sweat like a dog and I was so lethargic during the day I had to drink three energy drinks but damn I had some task vigilance.  That‚Äôs when I got into doing my own car repairs and writing my quantum mechanics notes."

Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed.

Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"This is making me really want to try Wellbutrin. I have suspected for a long time that I have some kind of ‚Äúhigh functioning‚Äù depression. I rarely have low lows, except for around my menstrual cycle. But my anxiety and depression feels like it‚Äôs always there, just really subtle. I find it really difficult to enjoy things and I am ALWAYS tired, mentally and emotionally drained. I basically spend every day just waiting for it to be over. I don‚Äôt even feel sad, I just always feel ‚Äúover it‚Äù. It‚Äôs hard to describe. 

In your experience is Wellbutrin more suited to people with depressive and manic episodes, impulsivity, etc? Or would it help someone like me who is generally pretty even?"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"[layperson here, take with grain of salt]

I came here to say this! Wellbutrin works for many people with ADHD, and I've seen many people take it for that during my many years in a support group program. It's also cheaper, not a controlled substance, and while any psych drug takes some attention to discontinue, Wellbutrin is much easier to stop than a stimulant. 

Modern research actually shows that Wellbutrin acts on dopamine and norepinephrine receptors (and nicotine, hence the smoking abatement usage), and has no clinical significant effect on serotonin receptors. Adderall is a combo of two medications that impact all three, though serotonin less than the other two. Methylphenidate (Ritalin) impacts a similar constellation of receptors.

Wellbutrin does take some time to have an impact in ADHD though compared to the stimulants, whereas stimulants are often more or less immediate acting. As someone who started stimulants for ADHD and a sleep disorder later in life, and who had already been on other psychiatric meds, it was surprising how difficult it can be to balance sleep, medication dose and timing, and eating as to avoid a crash when the stimulant wears off. Wellbutrin, for me, was not nearly as volatile when I was on it back in the day, so it also makes sense that a first med to try would be this one.

Just spit balling though, I'm not a medical provider, just play one on TV."

Previous doctor said the only reason why ADD got rolled into ADHD despite not being hyperactive was because the alternative was calling it not-depressed depression. And indeed, there was been plenty of experiential posts where the max inattentive and max hyperactive end up staring at each other like aliens.

The extreme hyperactive end of ADHD will post and I will think, ""I have no clue what you are talking about, but it sounds very similar to both my friend with manic depression and my friend with bipolar disorder."" On the other end someone that's zero hyperactive 100% inattentive posts here and there will be a flood of, ""Are you sure that's ADHD? That sounds like depression. I think you were misdiagnised. I don't ever have that."""
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"It really depends on the person because I was perscdibed wellbutrin off label and it had far worse side effects for me than adderall. 

On wellbutrin I felt, anxious, agitated, and was ready to get in an argument with anyone - it just made me feel like a nervous wreck. I also had crazy high libido which was miserably distracting

On stimulants like adderall my mind and body are more calm. Overall I feel much healthier after taking adderall for a few months than wellbutrin.

My primary care gave it to me because I was having panic attacks but then I started talking to a psych who said pretty much this same thing. He was ""hesitant to diagnose ADHD because the symptoms could be something else like anxiety or depression"" after talking to me for 30 minutes.

Thankfully I was talking to another therapist that got me the referral to a neuropsychologist. He talked to me for an hour and was like ""yeah so I'm going to send you for the full assessment. Be prepared for how much you'll hate being there for almost 4 hours."" But the test is mostly kind of fun, like brain teasers and pattern detection. Then there are other parts that made me want to rip my eyes out. But it showed everything, including the blaring ADHD-C that was higher than any other condition.

Currently on Adderall and Lexapro which my new primary care isn't thrilled about so I've started reducing the Lexapro. Honestly the Adderall seems more helpful than I would have expected once my mood stabilized a bit."

With ADHD you need to have different complaints SINCE CHILDHOOD. But, someone with depression or without a mental illness (mental illnesses are just human made constructs...). I hear a lot about negative side effects of the stimulant medication. There are many things that work like a charm with ADHD without the negative side effects. F.e. ADHD COACHING. For people with ADHD it's not impossible to learn, we learn slower. Therefore you see that with age people can ""lose"" the ADHD diagnose. Meaning, we learn tricks.

It's 'a' valid approach to treat ADHD with a non stimulant, in my case though, I need both, and it took a few tries to nail it down for me.

  Track your moods and productivity if you can with the Wellbutrin, and give feedback about how it's going at the next visit. 

 Consider finding and seeing a psychologist that does adult testing too if you're primary doc just doesn't 'see it'.  A psychologist might take more time to unpack why or why not.  It took years for me to tease out the distinct ADHD diagnosis, but it was worth it in the end.  Good luck!"

Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"ADHD is diagnosed by exclusion. He's excluding that those symptoms aren't being caused by other conditions.

Also those conditions are more common and aren't tested with controlled medications."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Getting something as an ‚Äúon label‚Äù treatment with the FDA is a financial choice on the part of the drug company and if Wellbutrin was near its patent expiration when it‚Äôs benefit in treating ADHD was discovered there wouldn‚Äôt have been any motivation for the drug company to add another approved usage for Wellbutrin. But it *is* on the list of non-stimulant ADHD medications that psychiatrists look to and many psychiatrists feel it‚Äôs more effective than something like strattera. So being ‚Äúoff label‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs ineffective.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"This is totally possible but honestly it's better to start with non stim if you can just to see. Wellbutrin has helped my executive dysfunction massively when other antidepressants and antianxiolytics couldnt (bc all of my anxiety and depression were from living w adhd lol), and is what I still use."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,yes this was how my visit went as well. Felt like my experiences were trivialized because it's easier to prescribe anti depressants than ADHD medicine
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Wellbutrin does have mild stimulant effects, which may be why they decided to choose that antidepressant as your first med to try. They may be hoping to either rule out or treat any underlying depression and also see if you experience any benefits from the other effects of the Wellbutrin. 

If they can see some improvement with the Wellbutrin, it might allow them the ability to control your symptoms with a much smaller dose of a stimulant med added in. The lower they can keep a stimulant dose, the better, since they can be a lot on the heart and can raise heart rate and BP, which could be an issue for you depending on your health and could impact their ability to prescribe them to you."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Give it a try.  If it works, great.  But if it doesn't and the doc tries an snri or the likes find a new doc."

Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"That's a valid concern, but it's actually fairly common to start with wellbutrin from what I've heard and experienced. Back when I first got diagnosed my psych started me on that first before adding in stimulants. I had a lot of depression symptoms too (which ended up mostly related to ADHD). The way my doctor described it is that it's used off label to treat ADHD and is better described as a mood stabilizer versus a true antidepressant. It kind of just helps make you more even keel. 

If it hasn't made a difference in a few months (or however long the doc recommends), and your doc is resistant to trying other options, then maybe it's time for a new doc."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"It's not a stimulant but it does sort of serve the same purpose. My simplified understanding is that well Wellbutrin can help with motivation and is more ""activating"". Im on Wellbutrin and Lexapro and the Wellbutrin balances out the ""meh"" feeling I get from Lexapro since that is more for mood stabilization.

There is a lot of overlap between ADHD and depression and anxiety. I came from the opposite direction having depression and anxiety forever then realizing it was actually ADHD that was the source of most of those symptoms and that helped a lot to learn and re-target what changes I needed to make."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"stimulants aren‚Äôt for everyone. adderall helped me be productive but gave me a lot of awful symptoms and ruined my appetite and just made me feel like shit in general. it definitely does suck to have adhd written off so quickly but hear me out: adhd is a lot rarer than anxiety and depression and it‚Äôs a lot harder to pinpoint than anxiety and depression. I disagree with how your psychiatrist went about treating you BUT, I understand what they‚Äôre doing. how you react to different medications can tell them a lot and help narrow down what you‚Äôre feeling. an adhd diagnoses is a big deal and they do this to prevent over-diagnosing it. if welbutrin doesn‚Äôt help you might go back and say ‚Äúit‚Äôs making me feel such and such‚Äù and they might try another medication that‚Äôs closer to adhd treatment and you might go back and say ‚Äúthis is helping blah blah blah but not with so and so‚Äù and they might try something else until they finally rule out anxiety/depression and realize you have adhd 

depression and anxiety are also often caused by having adhd as well (I have all three) and sometimes treating the anxiety and depression first can help the adhd. key word: sometimes. again, not sure I agree with this approach but im just trying to help you understand at least WHY they‚Äôre doing it this way. I know it sucks and you just want your diagnosis, but won‚Äôt it feel so much better once you finally do?"

Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Depression is physiological not mental
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Don‚Äôt let these people fool you into believing wellbutrin is actually good for adhd. It helps so little in comparison to actual first line treatment which are stimulants. Pepsi and coke scenario
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Wellbutrin is different than other antidepressants. It works on norepinephrine and dopamine just as amphetamines do. It is a cathinone which are actually considered stimulants generally. It's just very mild. It helped me a lot for two years before I was put on amphetamines. Give it a shot. You aren't likely to get Adderall right off the bat.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"It kinda is a stimulant, though... It is a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor. It can raise blood pressure and pulse, increases alertness, cause insomnia, increases sex drive and motivation..  characteristics of stimulant medications. Methylphenidate is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Caffeine up-regulates dopamine receptors and promotes dopamine and norepinephrine release. Amphetamine does a bunch of things to increase dopamine and block reuptake. Strattera is just a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, and it (arguably) isn't a stimulant. But Wellbutrin occupies this middle ground where it is a stimulant, but isn't really addictive.. and thus is less risky to prescribe.

It's definitely worth trying. I currently take it for depression and it does help with my ADHD especially motivation, I've tried many medications including stimulants and bupropion is one of the best for me, and better for me than stimulants.

It can be frustrating to feel unheard by your doctor. I've been in similar situations. Unfortunately, people who abuse ADHD medication often go into psychiatrist appointments playing the role of someone who has undiagnosed ADHD, in order to get the medication. You might have unknowingly looked medication-seeking. This is an unfortunate reality of psychiatry, and it's reasonable to try another medication especially bupropion. And you might genuinely not have ADHD. Conditions and disorders are basically pigeonholes that vaguely fit, and doctors don't think of it like ""well he has ADHD so I can only use medications approved to treat ADHD"" but instead ""based on previous experience, patients with these symptoms do well on bupropion and it's a good first thing to try"".

As far as what to expect: you may actually feel an effect the first day along with side effects. I know the 2nd through 5th days were great for me (but I had some emotional issues like random anger) and then I sorta settled into it and it started helping my depression around 2 weeks in. It can take up to a month or two to feel the full effect and notice how it's helping (or not)."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Wellbutrin is commonly used to treat ADHD. There‚Äôs other non-stim drugs that do as well. If you don‚Äôt like it (I didn‚Äôt, it made me nauseous) I just told my doc and said I wanted to try a stim."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I'm not sure where you live, but it's an actual official use where I'm at (Colorado, US) according to people and doctors I've spoken with, though I'm given to understand that's a relatively recent development."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"As others have said, it isn‚Äôt exclusively for depression. Many pharmaceuticals have multiple uses that seem unrelated.

It worked well for me, and I‚Äôd still be on it if not for an odd side effect. If it works for you it also means you don‚Äôt have to deal with all the ridiculous PITA restrictions around obtaining, and transporting stimulants (at least in the US). Plus none of the BS stigma around taking stimulants. Tons of stories here about folks dealing with piles of BS from family, friends, pharmacists, cops, and more because they‚Äôre on stimulants"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Off label is only to say the FDA hasn‚Äôt recognized it as treating ADHD, but there is plenty of research to support that it does help those with ADHD.  Part of ADHD is a lack of dopamine, and Wellbutrin blocks the reputable of dopamine.  

Im not going to say that every doctor knows best, but in this case, it is better to try Wellbutrin first before a stimulant.  Stimulants wear off, daily, and do not provide a consistent flow to your mood/headspace.  It‚Äôs also been shown that stimulants physically age you more than other types of medications, so if another solution works, it‚Äôs preferred.  

The better ADHD stimulants are hundreds of dollars monthly, where Wellbutrin has generics, so there‚Äôs the money factor as well."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Wellbutrin is an extremely common first prescription for ADHD. The doctor's tone might have been concerning, but only you know what he said and how. ADHD and depression *do* present many similar symptoms, *and* they are very often comorbid, and it's not at all uncommon for doctors to want to try to address depression first because most treat depression as a more severe problem on the priority scale.

Tbh you sound depressed. You feel certain you aren't, but that might just be because you have a certain idea of what depression is. Depression encompasses a lot of things, and being unmotivated and unable to get things done without any clear explanation of why is a classic sign of depression."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"It is often used as a first step to see if the stimulant-like properties help.

If it does, adding in ADHD meds can beat good second step.

Just be patient, it takes awhile for Wellbutrin to hit therapeutic dose.

A few issues at the beginning, but one day I woke up and did a bunch of stuff and was like... Holy shit..is this how non ADHD live?!

It was a good start for me. Don't discount it."

Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"> Modern research actually shows that Wellbutrin acts on dopamine and norepinephrine receptors

Wellbutrin does not act on those receptors. It attaches to dopamine and adrenaline transporter molecules, so they are not able to take away these chemicals.

Research shows that Wellbutrin only occupies like 10-20% of dopamine transporters, whereas for Ritalin it's above 50%."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Well, you don't RC.

including its lack of common mood medication symptoms, like weight gain   
and sexual side effects."

Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,It's what they always do for me. Controlled meds are a pain. If this works it's a cheaper easier option that won't require so many appointments because you can get refills for Wellbutrin. Wellbutrin works in some ways for my ADHD and not in others. Does the  same type of thing as Adderall but it's weaker. I was on Wellbutrun and ADHD combo but recently stopped Wellbutrin.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,My doc prescribed Wellbutrin first. It was okay? We did a med check after 30 days. I'm currently waiting on insurance to approve my shiny new Adderall prescription.

Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Wellbutrin gave me headaches, but did improve my mood a bit (when not dealing with the headaches anyway).  Straterra did very little other than make sex more difficult.

My understanding is that is fairly common that Wellbutrin does not work, but it has mild side effects and plays nicely with other meds so that's why it's usually tried first.  A lot of people do have success with Straterra.  If you're going to pick which to try first, Straterra would make more sense to me.  That said, I'm not a doctor and it didn't work for me anyway so take that with a large grain of salt.  and be sure to ask a real doctor :)"

Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Huh idk what you mean, I just scheduled an appointment to see if I had ADHD. They did the standard assessment of like ‚Äúrate from not at all to extreme how much you do the following‚Äù, and asked stuff like sitting still fidgeting etc 

The psych determined I might have ADHD and anxiety, they also said while I showed some signs of depression it wasn‚Äôt enough warrant a diagnosis and was likely just stemming from my ADHD, and started me on Wellbutrin to see how that goes. 

After 2 months (the Wellbutrin build up period) I told them it was helping with anxiety but not ADHD, and that I wanted to see if a stimulant might be better. This lead to a month of testing like EKG, blood and urine panel, QB testing, and another psych assessment. After all that they said I definitely have ADHD and will be able to prescribe Adderall, Ritalin or Vyvanse. They said start on adderall cause it works best for most people, so I‚Äôm in the 3 week trial period for it right now. 

I had asked if I should stop the Wellbutrin since I am starting Adderall and they said no the two meds can work well with each other."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"While I can't guarantee you won't have a negative experience, I can say that in my knowledge from my experience and communicating with others that its not super likely that the Wellbutrin will have a negative impact. If you haven't seen any really negative symptoms since starting it I don't think you will get them, but I can't say that for sure. Just knowing the makeup of how it works this is probably one of the lowest risk medications I know of. Keep a close eye on your experience, worst case scenario if its not going well for you you can wean off. I don't think you will have to worry too much though. Personally,  my work performance got better, and I've been really seeing even more progress on a combination of Wellbutrin, buspar, and Adderall. But Wellbutrin was an excellent start for me and this will help your doctor come around."

One downside (for me) - Wellbutrin is more consistent in keeping you alert for a longer period, so when I added that to Vyvanse, I had trouble falling asleep, where Vyvanse would kind of ‚Äòwear off‚Äô in the evening.  On the plus side, Wellbutrin controls the ADHD symptoms more consistently, where on a stimulant only, I‚Äôd wake up with ADHD brain and need to try to focus to get myself out of bed and take the med.

While I don't necc deny Depression- obviously much had to do with the fact that I felt like a damn failure at everything . It was a more slippery slope as I got older and wasn't doing as well at work , 'being forgetful ' etc  .. I just thought it was my lot in life and ME.      (Not an unusual story , but ..)
Bupropion addressed my nervousness as well as helped with my adhd."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"This may be an unpopular opinion, but I would recommend against exaggerating symptoms.  Also, not the best idea to really push hard for a controlled substance, can give folks the wrong impression.  And if there is a small amount of improvement with Wellbutrin most folks would be far more likely to increase the dose of a med you're already tolerating rather than introduce a second new medication with all its possible side effects and interactions.

Instead, try to keep a detailed log (on your phone or keep a little notebook on you) as to what exactly is not working for you.  You or your doctor might notice patterns that point toward a root cause/directed therapeutic that wasn't initially obvious.  If you have trouble doing this because, hello, ADHD, enlist someone you're close with to help remind you or to be the person you text to bitch that 'damn I still cant focus on my reading!' to have that logged.

I think the combo of both helps me a lot, Adderall relieves my adhd symptoms so I can find the motivation and focus for cooking/cleaning/ searching for a job. But just taking zoloft helped me with depression, like wanting to spend all day isolated in my room in bed. 

I definitely need both though, the adderall helps a lot and I‚Äôve had significant improvements with it. 

To OP, see if you can schedule an appointment to specifically discuss your concerns with adhd, think of any examples you can bring up. Things that you should be doing but struggle with attentiveness and drive to do.

Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"My therapist (not the one who actually gave me the rx) said that it‚Äôs not uncommon to have depression/anxiety masking other issues and once you address that, finding other problems like ADHD.

I didn‚Äôt feel like stimulants did much and had anxiety as they wore off. Wellbutrin has really helped."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"It has some qualities of anti-depressants and can also help manage it but the warning labels on all (most?) anti-depressants/anxiety meds are very clear that they can cause worsening symptoms and even suicidal thoughts in children and teens.

I'm so sorry you went through that. It's horrible."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Same but I‚Äôm on different meds now.  I wonder if the welbutrin and concerta in conjunction burns me out making my depression worse.  When I‚Äôm done work I don‚Äôt want to do anything.  I don‚Äôt think I cooked a meal in a month.  Slowly losing weight.  Tried incorporating some cannabis for sleep / depression / anxiety  but they don‚Äôt have any of the strains which were recommended to me by a physician and it doesn‚Äôt make me feel any better rested.  I wake up slightly easier then with seroquel but still feel tired most of the day even with concerta and welbutrin.  I‚Äôm going to inquire about lamictal as a sub for seroquel for mood under the supposition that if my guy is right ‚Äî ie what I call ‚Äúagitated depression‚Äù is a form of bipolar ii.  Could be why the moderate dose welbutrin doesn‚Äôt really do much for me either.  Iirc that‚Äôs not of use for depressions with bipolarity.  Also pursuing a sleep study based on convos I had with my pharmacist around using seroquel predominantly for sleep.  He claims they need to see your brain waves to know which medication would workI feel like my energy drink use also emerged due to daytime tiredness.

Tried adding dextromethorphan to the welbutrin per clinical trials showing it has a superior antidepressant response when added to it but just gets me more stuck in my head which is not surprising since it‚Äôs a dissociative hallucinogen lol."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"> It's a dopamine re-uptake inhibitor

It's a weak dopamine reuptake inhibitor. For some people with specific liver enzyme issues it doesn't even have DRI properties, but only NRI.

> Adhd Is characterized by dopamine deficits that's why wellbutrin could work. 

ADHD is associated with disruptions in many circuits and different gene variants. Dopamine deficit is not a remotely scientific explanation for this condition."

Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"> Yeah they normally won‚Äôt put you on a stimulant first!

Stimulants are the first-line treatment. If the doctor diagnoses ADHD only and they refuse to prescribe them, they're either quacks or cowards."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"> Yeah they normally won‚Äôt put you on a stimulant first! It‚Äôs much healthier if you can avoid it

Humm, citation needed? Stimulants are safer than many other psychiatric medications. The only reason that really holds off psychiatrists to prescribe them is abuse/addiction risk, which can be simply avoided by the patient not messing up with their doses (assuming the patient has not a severe substance use disorder)

Other than that, stimulants have risks for heart, but so does like every psychiatric medication, and many are riskier, so if stimulants are dangerous because of that, any psychiatric drug should also be"
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"> treating without a stimulant is 100% the correct move by your doctor. Throwing stimulants at a new diagnosis is irresponsible, and if you can get the results you are looking for without one, you'll be much better off.

I don't get this ""anti-stimulant"" sentiment. Not claiming that you're against stimulants altogether; I would just like to know why prescribing stimulants as first line treatment for ADHD should be bad and why you're much better off a stimulant.

Stimulants are medications, they (can/hopefully do) provide benefit to the patients. Just as attention symptoms may get better with an antidepressant, anxiety/depression symptoms may get better with a stimulant in a person who has ADHD and has always been unmedicated.

I would like to get, and so far I don't, why stimulants should be avoided as first medication, even better if there are sources. Taking into account that stimulants are among the safest and most effective medications in psychiatry."

No it isn't. Stimulants are the first-line treatment for a reason. There are specific guidelines to adhere to. Stop spreading pseudoscience."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Your story is literally identical to mine. I was prescribed super high dose in high school and hated it because of all the negative side effects. I stopped taking it till I was in the middle of college not being able to concentrate. So when I went back to my new doctor told him I had a bad experience with stimulant meds, an then he had me on Wellbutrin for a while by itself but very quickly I realized it wasn‚Äôt fixing the problem completely. So eventually he prescribed a low dose of XR and IR adderall with the Wellbutrin for which I‚Äôm on now‚Ä¶ An like it‚Äôs worked the best so far, but the come down of these have some significant side effects that I don‚Äôt like. Like the anxiety and irritability/grumpiness in the evening. Even with the booster it just feels like it‚Äôs prolonging the inevitable. 

Anyway, after my life story, I actually came here to ask you what SSRI your on exactly? I‚Äôm curious because I‚Äôve been considering changing the antidepressant side of my medication to help with my problem of the combined medications."

Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I have an Atrial Septal Defect that I‚Äôm getting checked out next week finally (takes forever to get into a cardiologist where I live). Getting off of the Vyvanse has lowered my resting heart rate from about 80 to 70, but my heart rate still spikes up to 180+ with even light exercise. I also have some fluttering (probably from the ASD) even at rest sometimes. I may just need to get it repaired. Originally when I was diagnosed with it at 13 (because of an abnormal EKG during surgery followed by an echo to confirm), I was told it likely would repair itself or it would never bother me. There is a chance that it has repaired itself and my cardiac issues are actually caused by long term use of stimulants, but I won‚Äôt know for sure without getting an echocardiogram.

If your doctor is not concerned about your heart, then just keep on trucking. Definitely talk to them about it if you are worried or notice any changes. There‚Äôs also no harm in starting with a non-stimulant ADHD med. I personally have had a lot of success with Straterra. It has helped the depressive and anxiety symptoms way more than stimulants and helps me keep up momentum when I‚Äôm focusing on a task. It doesn‚Äôt nail the gas pedal to the floor like stimulants do, but I honestly prefer that. I can always get a bit of caffeine or spike my blood sugar a bit if I‚Äôm having trouble getting into a focused mode."

Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"No, I've given up finding treatment because all I get is charged money and dicked around and ignored or put on things that i've already tried before and only give me the negative side effects and never anything that the pill is supposed to fucking do.

Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I wrote down tons of stuff before talking to my doctor about ADHD. Having it all written in front of me totally saved my ass at the appointment, because without my notes, my brain would have been a jumbled mess and I would *not* have been able to articulate properly. 

P.S. OP if you're reading this, Wellbutrin is prescribed for ADHD as well as depression. Some people don't need a stimulant for their ADHD, so give the meds a fair shot. Everyone is different. Wellbutrin worked well for me for the first couple of weeks and then I got hit with some gnarly side effects. Without the side effects, it would have been the perfect medication for me. 

Finding the right meds takes time, effort and perseverance, so please try and be patient, but don't hesitate to talk to your doctor about worries and how you feel about being dismissed. If they respond poorly, try and find a new doctor. Don't *seek* a doctor just to get an ADHD diagnosis, but find a doctor you feel like you can trust and be totally open and honest with. Then, they'll be able to diagnose you properly given your own personal circumstances. 

Good luck, OP. It's a long, windy road to get treated for ADHD, I hope you have luck in the near future."

All i needed was a  therapist but VA was medicine madness happy back then. Now that im  finally very happy about finally finding out after all these yrs thinking I was insane but couldn‚Äôt figure it out, reading all these books makes complete sense. Well VA said Im A-fib and I could tell that the psychiatrist knew nothing about Adhd, after a 25 zoom call, she said Wellbutrin works perfect for adhd which I‚Äôve researched data and find zero data to back this up. Placebos were more effective that Wellbutrin on every study. This is after I told her what antidepressants did to me ( suicidal) yet never before taking; and almost lost my marriage of 30+ yrs  and all 3 adult children behind antidepressants.  I‚Äôm scared to death to try Wellbutrin and they refused me any other stimulants period.

It‚Äôs different for everyone, so it might or might not work for you, but it actually can be effective to make the ADHD easier to cope with for some people. You won‚Äôt know unless you give it a chance. 

It might also not be majorly obvious when it starts working btw, but when I look back at my day, I‚Äôm like ‚Äúwow, I got a lot done and I didn‚Äôt struggle half as much as I usually do‚Äù.

Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"> there is literally an evaluation you can do.

The medical-scientific consensus is that the neuropsychological testing is not sensitive and accurate enough to rule in or rule out ADHD. These assessments are done for two reasons. Some physicians want to have some 'cover your ass' type documents before they prescribe a controlled substance. The second is that those tests are expensive, which makes them an excellent instrument for milking the patient and their insurance."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Yes, but if the symptoms can be caused by depression or anxiety, which are more common in the population, then ruling them out is highly appropriate. Or addressing them prior to testing."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Bruh, I‚Äôm not saying they should not give stimulants. They‚Äôre great and really effective. But it IS pretty normal for them to recommend a non-stimulant medication first. At least it was back when I first got on meds‚Ä¶ like I did not start with stimulants and it took about 6 months to find a good dose. 

Now, if you try a non-stimulant and it doesn‚Äôt work they should put you on a stimulant. That‚Äôs where the problem would be, but OP is not there yet."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I second the request for citations.  I don't know of any countries where stimulants are allowed where stimulants are NOT the first line treatment recommended for ADHD.  

Non stimulant meds haven't shown better treatment results.  They are nice to have options, but I'm not seeing any studies supporting them as a first choice.

Low dose stimulants are safe long term for most folk, well tolerated, and they work.  My Celebrex prescription is scarier."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Stimulants are Schedule II narcotics. Doctors do NOT want to prescribe things that can get them labeled as a pill mill and locked up in jail. Pharmacists do NOT want to fill doctor pill mill prescriptions for the highest level of legally dispensable drugs because they will lose their license and get locked up in jail. Distribution and abuse are enormous issues, doctors have no idea if you may be susceptible to addiction or be easily persuaded to sell your drugs. They‚Äôre covering their OWN ass legally.

Because if it was easy as saying you have ADHD and getting adderall in days, we would have a stimulant crisis the size of the opioid crisis. I am not agreeing or disagreeing on stimulants being treated this way. Just explaining that this is the reason why doctors do not use stimulants for every adhd patient - and hey, Wellbutrin and many other medications do actually work for patients. Overall, the less attention from the feds and DEA that is given to the doctor, the better for them."

Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I wouldn't say they're among the safest. Stimulants carry a risk of sudden death if there is an unknown heart defect which is not uncommon. Also not great if you have high BP which a large amount of the population does. Any med which is psychoactive carries risk. Instantly gratifying controlled medications always have a chance of being misused. If someone benefits from Wellbutrin, an NDRI (which is a mild stimulant anyway) but needs a bit more of a push, that like a safe bet to move on to amphetamines or phenidates."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"That's also a question for the FDA, DEA , medical, pharmaceutical boards , honestly.

Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"I am not anti-stimulant‚Äî I am currently taking stimulants. The doctor that treated me the first time I was prescribed Adderall went the typical route of putting me on the typical dose for my age/weight. I had horrible side effects, including lack of sleep, loss of appetite, and anxiety attacks, and stopped medication as a result. 

The negative experience of a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù treatment left me unmedicated for 10 years and afraid of treatment. 

I‚Äôm grateful that my doctor worked with me to find a balance that works for me that doesn‚Äôt involve the cycle of riding a high and crashing that I remember from being over medicated. For me, that comes with being on the lowest effective dose of stimulants that I can use to get me through the workday in combination with antidepressants."
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"So the thing about medicine (the practice) is that you want to try therapies that have some history of efficacy and the least negative side effects. Then if necessary you escalate to other efficacious treatments that may have more serious or concerning side effects. If a patient can be treated with the least harmful treatment, you opt for that first. Same as they‚Äôd give a lower dose of a medication first to gauge effectiveness and titrate up incrementally until the least effective dosage is reached. 

I think that‚Äôs good medicine (the practice) and applied across the board."

Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"Its the ""don't let them fool you it works"" dismissal. 

It DOES work for tons of people with adhd even if it doesn't work for everyone. When I did Stims first they made me more jittery and agitated than they did anything helpful. Few years later after being on just welbutrin for a while I had a better basline to start adding small doses of ritalin and feeling a meaningful difference. 

Which makes sense, since it's a dopamine regulator, aka slows down how quickly you process dopamine. Doesn't matter how many stimulants you throw at a brain that absorbs them as fast as possible, you may just be increasing the side effects and crash effect. 

Welbutrins side effects are also typically milder than high doses of stimulants."

Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Yeah I was warned that Wellbutrin had the potential to increase symptoms of anxiety but when I told my doctor I‚Äôve been feeling less anxious while on it she theorized that much of my anxiety was being caused by my untreated ADHD rather than generalized anxiety disorder.

Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Yeah give Wellbutrin an honest try. Keep in mind it can be a rough adjustment period but it gets better.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"If you actually read the OPs post, you will see that they say ‚Äúwent to psychiatrist for ADHD concerns‚Äù, therefore they do not appear to have a formal diagnosis and because they‚Äôre on Reddit I assume they‚Äôre at least an adolescent or adult. 

Now I can‚Äôt assume much more than that, but because there appears to be some kind of hesitance on the doctors part to prescribe stimulants, I am making the assumption it‚Äôs likely a complicated ADHD diagnosis with potential co-morbidities and that the OPs physician is still in the process of diagnosis. 

Due to this it is extremely common for the doctor to attempt to prescribe a medication to alleviate the most debilitating symptoms that the OP is experiencing. 

I‚Äôve linked to the CADDRA guidelines for ADHD here: https://www.caddra.ca/pdfs/caddraGuidelines2011.pdf 

Take a look at the differential diagnosis section. Furthermore, you can see that chapter 7 discusses first, second, and third-line medications for uncomplicated ADHD diagnosis (aka confirmed ADHD diagnosis) in children, adolescents, and adults. Based on my inferences above, the OP does not have a clear cut diagnosis, and because of this, it‚Äôs nonsensical to just prescribe someone stimulants without exploring further. 

Your claim that this would be malpractice is frankly laughable, please always be mindful of context and nuance. The thinking that health and wellness is black and white is extremely dangerous. 

And if the OPs physician is truly committing malpractice, they can always file a complaint.

Edit: grammar."

Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"So one thing might be if the doc thought there was anxiety independent of ADHD (or anxiety masking ADHD) the Vyvanse would probably make that worse, whereas the Wellbutrin would likely help.  Stimulants often make sensory sensitivities worse as well.  It's got a broader mechanism of action and, aside from being a... third? -line treatment option for ADHD, will help more with any depression. Also cravings, bupropion is approved as a smoking cessation aid in Europe and is part of a weight-loss combo pill in the States.

Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,"The addiction of stimulants on people with ADHD is dubious as well. Sure, you want to keep taking medication because it makes you feel more ""normal"", de-stressed and able to promptly do stuff you're not interested in. 

But if it's so addictive, how come a huge percentage of us, myself included, forget to take them regularily and feel no withdrawal symptoms what so ever? Tried going without for a week just to see what happened. Everything was messier and more stressful, and my stress management skills were the usual crap. But I felt no draw towards stimulants, no shivers, no dreaming, nothing. Things just calmed down mentally when I took my meds again."

Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Effexor is a very good medicine for anxiety.  I used it with seroquel.  Made me sweat like a dog and too lethargic during the day and I was up to like 190 lbs which is too much for me so I dropped em and then I realized just how much they were doing for me because I tanked hard into a state of pure despondency and at that point I knew I have to be on medication permanently until I‚Äôm dead.
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,I know Effexor is really tough medication in many ways but it‚Äôs changed my life. Really helped with AdD
Went to psychiatrist for ADHD concern.. they put me on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm not depressed. What do I do?,Effexor has half of its mechanism (norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) and I think it‚Äôs also a weak dopamine reuptake inhibitor as well.  So it‚Äôs redundant if you are using psychostimulant treatment at the same time.

I hope that the adderall helps you! Also if you can try to remember to eat a little something after you take it, like banana or some cheese and crackers! (your doc probably let you know??)

Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Wellbutrin is prescribed off label for adhd - it‚Äôs not an SSRI, it effects dopamine, so it‚Äôs more similar to an adhd med than a typical antidepressant.

I wouldn‚Äôt write it off before giving it a chance. I‚Äôve been on it off and on for a few years. I eventually added an adhd/stimulant med, but if you can find the balance of less medication rather than more, I feel that would be preferable, at least to me."

But it is a first line treatment for chronic migraines so people have fewer migraines. But nobody is saying the people with migraines have seizures bc Topamax is considered a seizure medication. In fact, I believe the first indication for Wellbutrin was for smoking cessation. But nobody is saying you are a smoker. This question comes up a lot ie ‚Äúwhy did my doctor give me Wellbutrin antidepressant for adhd.‚Äù The answer is because it is indicated, according to evidence based medicine to treat adhd."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I think it takes around a month to kick in for most people for whom it works, so you gotta kind of sacrifice a chunk of time to see whether you're one of the lucky ones."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I was on Wellbutrin and unfortunately it didn‚Äôt work for me. I‚Äôve seen it be effective in people who couple it with an fda approved adhd medication, either stimulant or non stimulant. My doctor told me that Wellbutrin has been effective in treating those who have depressions and/or anxiety as a comorbidity to adhd. 

I encourage you to be communicative with your doctor during this time. If it works, great. If it doesn‚Äôt, you can tell them ‚Äúthis is NOT an adhd medication and I would like to begin adhd specific treatment.‚Äù So many doctors are so hesitant to give stimulants even though they are the first line / more effective treatment for adhd. I personally had to jump through so many hoops before I got my stimulant script and started actually noticing a difference. I hope it goes well for you."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,I *thought* Wellbutrin didn‚Äôt work for me until I got off it. Definitely helped with my attention and motivation.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,I do great on Welbutrin. I much prefer it to stimulants.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Buproprion (Wellbutrin) has shown some benefit in treating ADHD symptoms, see [Verbeck et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6485546/) and [Hile](https://digitalshowcase.lynchburg.edu/dmscjournal/vol2/iss1/15/).

Buproprion takes longer to start showing its effects, my psychiatrist had said about 2-3 weeks, so keep that in mind.

That being said, just like any other ADHD medication, it does not work for everyone. 

What you are beginning is a process that is largely trial and error, the most important thing you can do is be honest with your Doctor, and communicate any updates.

Finding the right medicine will take time, and then finding the right dose will take time. But the reduction in symptoms is worth it once you get there."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I took Adderall and Wellbutrin together for about 4 months, and recently stopped taking the Adderall altogether. I've noticed that my energy and focus took a pretty massive hit, but avoiding the side effects has made it worthwhile. The Wellbutrin still keeps my mood regulated and helps me get through the day."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I felt like wellbutrin helped my ADHD. Smarter folks than me have explained in this sub how wellbutrin affects your dopamine so I guess it makes sense. My doctor had me on wellbutrin not only for ADHD but also depression, and it was taken in conjunction with stimulants. 

Often doctors will want you to try antidepressants and/or non-stimulant meds before jumping into the stimulants. My advice would be to give it a chance and if it's not giving you the results you want, be patient and communicate that to your doctor at the next appointment."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Wellbutrin is used off-label for ADHD. Not a first line treatment. If you do have ADHD and they are prescribing a stimulant they would have put you on Straterra. I dont know why they put you on Wellbutrin as a first line treatmeant.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,My psych NP didn't want to prescribe stimulants because of my blood pressure. I started guanfacine first and eventually found a dose where it helped with motivation and task initiation. Then I started Wellbutrin and in my second week of it I noticed improved attention and focus. That kind of waned and then I did a dose increase and the attention's back to a pretty good place.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"First of all, nice work getting an appointment! I‚Äôve been in your shoes before, seeking help and feeling the disappointment of not getting what I wanted. Wellbutrin did not quite do the trick for me but it was stepping stone towards finding better help. Here‚Äôs a few questions that may help you: 

1. Were you diagnosed with ADHD, depression, or both before or after the appointment?

You can usually check your medical record online or call your doc to ask. This may sound obvious, but your diagnosis influences your medication.

2. What was your primary reason for setting up the appointment from the doc‚Äôs point of view?

I suffered from depression on top of ADHD, mostly caused by the situations my brain got me into. The thing is, I always made made appointments when I was at my low point and depression was always the focal point of my visits.


3. Did you ask to try a specific medication or specific treatment?

Be sure that you actually talk to your doctor about what you want. The appointment is not a good time to mask. You may not always get what you want, and what you want may always not work out, but it‚Äôs best not to take the backseat. Do some research, make a plan, and call your doctor ahead of time to tell them something specific that you want to discuss (a specific treatment, medication, etc.) to help guide the conversation.

Good luck, hang in there!"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"It helped me a lot. I honestly loved it. It was definitely more subtle but it made me more on top of things and I noticed more when I was off task. I have co morbid anxiety and it was an absolute god send for that. I was less distracted by anxious thoughts and got wayyy more done. My mood was a lot better too. Had to switch to taking it at night because it made me sleepy but doing so helped. 

I‚Äôd heard from people wellbutrin and a low dose stimulant was a powerful combo and requested it from my doc to ‚Äúclose the gap‚Äù on what I still wasn‚Äôt satisfied with. She had me check my blood pressure first and sure enough it was sky high. Stopped taking the wellbutrin and wish so badly I could go back but i‚Äôve got heart issues so it‚Äôs now a no go for me."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"According to Barkley, best practice for treating ADhD is to treat depression/anxiety first and treat remaining adhd symptoms afterwards.  Depression/anxiety can mimic many add symptoms (eg lack of focus control etc)"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"It helped my depression but definitely not my ADHD. Still haven't found anything that does more than put a dent in it, though."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Works wonder for motivation / energy. Not much for focus, but it does somethings to improve my executive dysfunction. 

It took me a full year of taking it daily before I really started to appreciate what it does for me, and my ADHD. 

I was originally prescribed it for depression and while I haven‚Äôt been depressed for ~4 years now, i have no plans of stopping Wellbutrin, for my ADHD specifically. 

Fuck other peoples experiences, only one that matters here is your experience. Try and take a step back and see what the medication does for you objectively, both the good and bad as well as how you are without it. Make a decision on which is a better way for you to live. 

Good luck happy to answer questions"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"i was on wellbutrin first and while it worked amazingly for my depression, it wasn‚Äôt the ticket for the adhd symptoms so i‚Äôm on concerta for that now and the combo has been good for me so far. when my psych initially prescribed the wellbutrin it was done w the thought that it would hopefully help some of the symptoms of depression that overlap w adhd like difficulty w attention etc. i think having the depression ultimately treated successfully w wellbutrin is what made it obvious i also had adhd and led to that diagnosis ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"It hasn't helped my focus/motivation as much as the Adderall used to, but I've got way less side effects on it so it's the better option for me."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"My Dr. prescribed it initially. She gave me the choice between it and Adderall, but at the time it made sense to try it since I'd had a lot of stuff going on in my life and it wasn't clear if I had depression too. It worked but made me grind my teeth at night, so I stopped taking it and started having ADHD issues again. I'm on a low does of Adderall IR and it works better for me.  
FWIW I noticed an improvement in my symptoms immediately on Wellbutrin, so not everyone has to wait a while for it to take effect."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I just switched to it, so I haven‚Äôt been on it long enough to say, but my current combo of Wellbutrin and Prazosin is the best I‚Äôve felt in a long time. Like with everything medical, a lot of your personal medical history affects what you might be prescribed. While stimulants are still the most effective for most folks, they also have a lot more side effects. I switched from Adderall because it increased my HR and BP and I could NOT eat. I would give it a shot and if you aren‚Äôt happy at your follow up discuss it with your doctor."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I take both wellbutrin and methylfenidate, but i was also diagnosed with depression. I feel like the biggest change is my impulse control and control over my emotions. For concentration and tasks I still need to take other medication then wellbutrin."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I take Wellbutrin for my depression, but I also have ADHD, so it kind of counts as a 2-fer. I probably would not be on Adderall now if I did not take Wellbutrin. When I first started taking it, no joke, it legitimately felt like the sun shone brighter. It helps immensely with my emotional dysregulation, which was always my worst ADHD symptom.

I was on a long journey with mental health and medication, and I suppose I still am, but like many things in life, people are more likely to report on having a bad time than they are a good one. This sub has a lot of people share good experiences with stimulants, but there are plenty of people who do not have good experiences on them, too. Be careful not to seek out your bias. I got so worked up about side effects and what they would do to me when I first started taking medication as a teen that I didn't try the first one I was prescribed. I don't remember what it was, but I brought the mindset into every subsequent med I tried and really did not have a good time.

Give it an honest try for a few weeks before deciding if it works for you or not. I really tried to check in with my body and my mood with Wellbutrin, what worked or didn't, and it made the conversations I had about my medicine a lot more productive. I didn't drink and tried to sleep for 7-8 hours, maintaining a mostly regular sleep schedule as well. These things probably would have helped me without the meds, but now I had a good baseline for when I'm like huh why isn't the med working?. The XR does not work at all for me, just makes me moody and reactive, but the SR works wonders. It sucks, but it is a process, and you can only hope that the experience of one helps build upon the next."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I've been on Wellbutrin for several years for depression. My doctor took me off of it last summer due to a newly diagnosed seizure disorder. After a couple weeks my concentration and attention span was shot. My mind was racing all the time so I couldn't sleep. I started behaving more impulsively and hyper fixated on buying a house. I bought the house after just a couple weeks of looking ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. It's worked out thankfully but if I was thinking more clearly I probably would have gone about it more slowly. Anyway, I told my doctor about my symptoms, and after determining it wasn't  a manic episode, she said I probably have ADHD and the Wellbutrin was helping with the symptoms. Thinking back to before the Wellbutrin, I behaved similarly, spending excessively, hyper fixations, short attention span, poor concentration and memory etc. I'm back on it and feeling better now. All that being said, yes Wellbutrin has helped with my ADHD. It doesn't help with all the symptoms though so, I've started Vyvanse as well now. I'd say just try it out to see if it helps, then next month you can talk with your doctor about adding on meds or changing things up. Good luck!"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,It can help but the odds aren't good.  They like to start with Wellbutrin and Strattera as they're safer and easier than stimulants.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Wellbutrin did not work for me either. It increased my anxiety and I developed facial twitches
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,my buddy said it helps him a bit -- the strattera side effects didnt die down for him so his doctor tried wellbutrin.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"It's helped me with executive function issues. I did have to double my dose for it to be really effective, but definitely give it some time."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Yes, it helped some, but it helped with my depression and anxiety more than anything. Wellbutrin isn‚Äôt to treat ADHD, but rather help minimize some of the symptoms of ADHD. It got me more motivated, I mean I was basically dead for 3 years and totally unmotivated, so it was a good ‚Äújump start‚Äù for me. I hadn‚Äôt even been diagnosed with ADHD when I started Wellbutrin, but it wasn‚Äôt long after that I was. They added a dose of Straterra with it, and then I was great and good to go! Perhaps it‚Äôs just an experiment to see how well you do on it before moving on / trying new meds"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"If you have a lot of anxiety or sleeping problems an anti depressant can be a bit safer because stimulants generally make those things worse.

My doctor tried wellbutrin first for those reasons. But then I told her I was essentially dri king absurd amoubts of caffeine to self medicate and she realized that the anxiety and sleeping problems might be due to the caffeine intake. And I need the effects of a stimulant (because caffeine is a stimulant too and v common for undiagnosed ppl to be abusing).

Unfortuneately not one drug works for everyone so it is a bit of a guessing game at first. The reason why wellbutrin can be effective for adhd is that it effects dopamine which we arent able to reabsorb at the same rates as other ppl. So stimulants and wellbutrin can both help with this.

As a side note I did find wellbutrin EVENTUALLY HELPFUL. meaning i kept trying to get my body to adjust to it and eventually it did effect the adhd paraylasis. But I def perfer stimulants."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I tried it and a different but very similar medication that worked better for me. If Wellbutrin isn't a good fit, strattera is very similar as a SDRI. It's slightly more regulated, though. My girlfriend uses Wellbutrin and gets good results. I found I got the most out of strattera by combining a lower dosage of it with a low dose of Adderall XR.

Wellbutrin/strattera side effects are worst in the first first two or three weeks on them. My stomach was upset for a few hours after taking each dose and I had trouble peeing for a while, but the side-effects went away pretty quickly, and it did wonders for my anxiety."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Wellbutrin is an antidepressant that sometimes works for adhd! It can also be used to help people that are trying to leave drugs! As far as I understand it, Wellbutrin is one of those meds that people who can't use stimulants can get to help them. My psyquiatrist sent me wellbutrin and it actually helped me a little for the first couple weeks, it just wasn't enough for me, but I am an example of people who had a somewhat good experience.
The most important part you need to remember is to be aware of how you're feeling, keep tabs on your energy/emotions and be honest with your doctor. Tell them what you think, how you feel, what you are missing, what is bothering you.
Good luck!, and i hope you find a match soon!!"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"It works for me when adderall and stratega did nothing.   I don‚Äôt take it for depression, rather the off label benefits it has for some people with ADHD.   It reduced my tendency to hyperfixate and helped me catch myself when I would be starting to fall into some negative behaviors associated with my ADHD symptoms.  Give it a shot!"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,A lot of times attention is intimately tied with anxiety and depression. Often times even if a doctor suspects that you have ADHD they‚Äôll try anti-depressant/anti-anxiety medication first to see what is the proportion of contributing factors.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"After a few months, it did NOT help at all. God... it was good at the start though!  


You know the debilitating feeling of being frozen and unable to get up and do said thing? ADHD paralysis. If anything, wellbutrin made it worse for me.   


I still take wellbutrin 300mg because it's good for my depression but I also take dexamphetamine with it. I feel like it makes the comedowns smoother.   


If I were you I'd still give it a shot because it's easy to come off of. Within 1 week I was good (i'm back on it now). It's not like a hellish SSRI months long taper off at all."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Wellbutrin is amazing for my ADHD. So over ritalin, afterall, etc - makes me a hyper nut. I get shit done but crash hard. Wellbutrin, I‚Äôm even keeled. Don‚Äôt drink alcohol on it. That‚Äôs no bueno."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I had Wellbutrin as an adjunct to Ritalin. It‚Äôs an interesting drug, less an anti depressant and more a general mood elevator. But it does little for the actual ADHD issues."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Didn't do a damn thing for me. It made me lose a noticeable amount of hair, too. Apparently it's an uncommon but not unheard-of side effect."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"We think Wellbutrin helped my symptoms when I was a kid, because I was only dx‚Äôd with depression. When I went back on it hoping it‚Äôd help the ADHD (I was dx‚Äôd at 24, yay being a girl) as an adult, it didn‚Äôt do so much. 

Give it a try, see if it helps, if not it‚Äôll change your next appointment."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,This is a great discussion to have with the PHARMACIST when you pick up your meds.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Wellbutrin scared the shit out me. I took 1 pill and about an hour later I was at work and I got this super loud ring in both my ears to the point I couldn't even hear anything going on around me, then I turned pale white and almost collapsed to the ground. Never took it again after that"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,it made my anxiety worse and wasn't that great of an an anti-depressant for me.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"It's an ndri, meaning it affects neuropinephrine. It was honestly my favorite since it tackled both my ADHD and my depression. Downside is after a few years it starts to wear off. Not for everyone though! It gave my friend gut wrenching anxiety! It's funny bc he loves Adderall but I hate it since it has same anxiety affect on me.

Edit: oops it's an ndri (neuropinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor). It works directly with the ADHD juices"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I fucking love wellbutrin. It changed my life. But I also take cipralex and concerta. Its a lovely cocktail. Wellbutrin alone? I dunno, I hope it provides some relief!"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I think it's different for everyone. Even though we all have the same disorder, we all have different brains. When I first saw my psychiatrist she prescribed me wellbutrin as well, and I was skeptical, but it is a process. Now I take Wellbutrin XL and Concerta together and I think it works great."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Reading everyone's experiences I might seek out changing my fluoxetine to wellbutrin
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Wellbutrin did nothing for me but help me quit smoking.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I was put on Wellbutrin for ADHD when I was first diagnosed. It was life changing. I still take it. 

Everyone is different of course but don‚Äôt be disappointed. It is an antidepressant but well known as an effective off-label Adhd med. It may be very effective for you."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I was diagnosed with ADHD and depression at the same appointment, and they started me on Wellbutrin for the first month (actually almost exactly a year ago). My GP didn‚Äôt like that I smoked weed and had been willing to try an adderall from my roommate - which I understand looks bad (I probably just shouldn‚Äôt have told him) but I was 21 at the time, barely surviving college, and self medicating was the only option I had for years (nothing crazy, I was just smoking occasionally, and had tried adderall once before my official diagnosis bc the medical system was so slow and I was panicked that I was going to fail out of school). That whole first month I quit smoking and drinking completely, and after the month was up I brought up adderall again. Doc started me on 10mg and was really stubborn, telling me ‚Äúyou‚Äôve already made it through high school with good grades‚Äù (which I barely managed and not without a significant cost to my mental health). The Wellbutrin helped a little with the depression, which mainly made it feel like I had the energy to get out of bed, take care of myself, and go to class, but it didn‚Äôt really do anything for the ADHD. After I went home I went back to my old GP and they upped me to 15mg, then I went abroad for 5 months and finally landed on 20mg when I got home, which seems to be doing the trick. 

You didn‚Äôt waste money on an appointment; the American healthcare system sucks and takes forever, but you got the ball rolling and that‚Äôs what matters - honestly, finally asking for help and getting a diagnosis was one of the biggest hurdles for me. Give the Wellbutrin time, and as it starts working, try to establish some good basic self care routines. It may not help the adhd directly, but it can certainly help you feel better as you move in the right direction. Days 7-14 might feel worse, but the way my sister described it to me is that the ‚Äúantidepressants can help lift the brain fog you‚Äôre feeling, which can initially make you more aware of how shitty you feel, but then it starts to help the depressive symptoms.‚Äù 

And if it‚Äôs really not the right fit and isn‚Äôt working for you (I eventually stopped because I felt blunted, but now I‚Äôm considering an anti anxiety medication), then you can ask your doctor about alternatives: worst comes to worst and your doctor won‚Äôt budge, you have a diagnosis and you can find a new doctor who understands ADHD better."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,I don‚Äôt have depression but Wellbutrin gets me out of bed in the morning. Other meds help with adhd. It's the right combination for me. No side effects at all for me.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I‚Äôm on adderall for ADHD and Wellbutrin for depression and it‚Äôs a great combo for me!! I don‚Äôt take the adderall on weekends because I don‚Äôt need it (no demanding tasks, just chilling) and I notice a difference - Wellbutrin isn‚Äôt a substitute."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Several of my clients use Wellbutrin for ADHD. I was skeptical myself at first because I only had known Wellbutrin to be prescribed for completely different things. But one client was really struggling and she tried the regular stuff and Adderall and Vyvanse made her manic and the anxiety was unbearable. Wellbutrin has saved her. I'm a believer in this treatment for sure now.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,I take both Adderall and Wellbutrin. Some people are different it stuff works differently for different people!
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Before I knew I had ADHD I got Wellbutrin for depression. It helped with things like task initiation, focus, energy and mood. I accidently fixed half my ADHD with 300 mg but it took a couple months for me to see major benefits."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Honestly, I have heard that Wellbutrin helps with a lot of things and i haven't heard any negatives.  I am even considering asking my dr if i can go on it. But worried because I don't eat enough and Wellbutrin helps bine eating."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Wellbutrin didn't work for me, but look at it like this, you have to go through the process of what doesn't work to find what does. if you don't respond well to it then your psychiatrist will very likely change you to a different medication. I know that this is an often used stepping stone before giving someone a stimulant medication at least that is what I've observed and been told."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,I miss my Wellbutrin
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"It did nothing for my ADHD, but it worked wonders on my OCD and anxiety. I had to trial it for a couple of months before my doctor would believe I needed a stimulant medication. I hate that kind of gate keeping, but I wanted a doctor in the same network as my primary care."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Give it a try.  It does work for some and doesn‚Äôt have the side effects of some other meds for ADHD.  If it doesn‚Äôt help then ask to try another.  It‚Äôs highly unusual to get the right meds at the right dosage so be patient.  Once it‚Äôs figured out it‚Äôs typically stable for many many years.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"haha - that's awesome !   
I was about to post the exact same question yesterday - but my computer glitched !   
And here it is - with 544 replies to read up on !"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Wellbutrin did nothing for me. But all bodies & brains are different. Just keep a log of symptoms and concerns to share at your one month check up. Good luck!
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,it takes a couple weeks. i described it as giving me one extra moment to think. like a little buffer. i don‚Äôt know at this point if it is still effective for me personally but it has helped tremendously
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,It actually really helps my adhd
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,I literally just saw a psychiatrist for the first time a few weeks ago and she prescribed me THE SAME FCKING THING! I told her I was down to try it but I‚Äôm three weeks into it and I feel absolutely NO DIFFERENT. The Wellbutrin has made me extremely emotional and I‚Äôm becoming agitated and irritated so quickly. She said we would try strattera next üôÑ. It seems like doctors are scared to prescribe stimulants bc we are having a shortage of them atm.. let me know how it goes for you!
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,I take wellbutrin for PMDD and don't feel like it does anything for my ADHD (I take Vyvanse for that).
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Since I‚Äôm here‚Ä¶ anybody have anything to say about Adderall + Lexapro combination? My doc says it‚Äôs a common combo.
But I‚Äôm wondering what it did for you."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Why on earth do they give out antidepressants for everything? It drives me nuts. I have bipolar disorder and antidepressants are DANGEROUS for bipolar disorder because they trigger mania (found that out the hard way). Doctors are just way too careless with antidepressants, handing them out to everyone for issues that are NOT depression. It irks me."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I started with 2 x 10mg methylphenidate first week. Then added 10 the week after. Spoke with the nurse, was told to go up in dosage. So went to 3 x 20 mg. In two days I can add 10-20 mg each dosage. I have been taking 54 mg‚Äôs one time a day next to that. Just one each morning but not for the record. I think maximum they will go up to is 60 mg each dose."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"While it's not an official treatment for adhd, in theory it could work since wellbutrin helps with low dopamine levels, which usually occurs from adhd. It kind of worked for me. As soon as it was increased from 150mg to 300mg, I could tell a positive difference, but then I also had a ton of side effects that were not manageable and I had to stop taking it."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Wellbutrin worked really well for my depression but i didn‚Äôt find it helping my adhd that well and had to take concerta as well (as needed) but the major issue for me was that i also have an eating disorder and it affected my appetite. i don‚Äôt use it anymore because it was really difficult to get in my country so i switched to a different one.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I'm on it for depression and anxiety and tbh I don't think it does much, however I ran out for like a week and my ADHD was so bad, it was insane.  Basically it brings me to a still-bad-but-not-debilitating level.  I described that week to my mom as ""I know that legally ADHD is classified as a disability, but this is the first time that I have felt disabled."""
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,It did basically nothing for me but everyone is different.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"don't give up, it was not a waste. it's common practice for psychiatrists to try antidepressants first, and even to combine them to stimulants to reach the best possible result. 

just quit if the doc doubts the existence of adhd or refuses to listen to you. in your next meeting, tell her how it went. you'll possibly notice that you can have more benefit / that your adhd symptoms are still present. 

i know how frustrating it is though - i went through many terrible months at college, with my psychiatrist ""trialing"" different meds, and for a while i considered trying a different doc because returning would take so long.

but now i'm on vyvanse (other than my antidepressant that really helps with some other things, like sleeping; and after trying 3 different doses of ritalin, which didn't help) and waiting was absolutely worth it. so here's my words of encouragement, you'll get there. one step at a time!"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Didn‚Äôt help me at all. Only stimulants work for me. They like to try everything they possibly can before stimulants. So sometimes you gotta go through the preliminary crap of trying a bunch of useless meds just to prove to them they don‚Äôt work so you can get stimulants.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Yeah, it sucks how some psychiatrists use this first even though stimulants are first-line treatments"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,youll need Strattera or a stimulant. Strattera worked for my a lot of my adhd but the side effects were NOT worth it.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,You can always call your doctor and tell her it's not working for you and you don't like the way it's making you feel try Vyvanse cause ypu can't get Adderall. Also what type adhd? How severe?
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"So you've coming at this from the completely wrong angle.

You are coming in very entitled and rude - and you're coming across as a pill seeking college kid who just wants the drugs to sell/ abuse.

1. There is a massive industry shortage right now of Adderrall.
2. The feds have cracked down hard on ""pill-mills"" that were handing out prescriptions left and right - which has created a heavy push right now for medical staff to try everything else before stimulant drugs.
3. It is very common to start on non-stimulant drugs - especially after you reach adulthood, as stimulant drugs often have people develop a tolerance for them over time. The longer you can avoid them reasonably, the better.
4. As others have mentioned, Wellbutrin is an off-label ADHD medication. ADHD, Depression, & Anxiety are extremely common to appear together - which Wellbutrin excels heavily in treating the latter two.

So maybe slow your roll, check your attitude, and do some damn homework before bitching and kvetching that your therapist is somehow a waste."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"It‚Äôs definitely not a negative on adhd . But the thing is these side effects SUCK. I mean they SUCK. I really want to like this medication! But at times it can be 9pm at night and my heart rate will be through the roof with the smallest amount of additional stimulation .

If I take one hit of weed , BOOM BP over 160, one too many cups of coffee, BOOM it feels like I‚Äôm having a heart attack . 

Something happens that emotionally disturbing ? Boom high heart rate .

It‚Äôs annoying , because overall the medicine has positive effects with motivation and energy and impulsive controls . It allows me that extra second to be like , ‚Äúhuh , do I actually want to smoke weed right now ??‚Äù ‚ÄúHuh, do I want to lay here and watch 40 minutes of Andrew hubberman?‚Äù 

But then, I‚Äôll be alone, and my heart will be beating through my chest. I can‚Äôt take it. 


I‚Äôm now trying as needed . Which I‚Äôm not telling my doc about yet . But I noticed effects first day, and the bad effects didn‚Äôt start for a week or two , so I‚Äôm hoping maybe I can get off just using 2-4 days a week"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"It kinda mellows the peaks of my panic attacks and the overwhelming build-ups but other then that i cant say it helps much. Im on 300mg for depression and anxiety though and i read that for treatment for adhd the dose is 450mg with wellbutrin. Getting assessed for adhd now so it will be interesting whenever i can start on ¬´real¬ª adhd meds. 

I feel very sorry for everyone having to deal with these half assed treatments. I understand that its better to try the treatments that is the most healthy for you long time first, but i cant help but think that the decisions is based in bad knowledge of adhd. Struggling alot with adhd on a daily basis is not good for you either and many of us has been fighting for many years to even get to a point of assessment."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"This is fairly typical, I think. For one, there are fewer hoops to jump through because it's not regulated, and if it works, that's that. It could also be that they're ruling out some depression as a source of your symptoms, but that seems unlikely because so many things can cause and treat depression. My doc tried this and it did nothing at all.

Tell them it's not doing much of anything and that you still have all the ADHD symptoms."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"i can't speak on wellbutrin since i've never been on it, but what i can say is that technically my doctor prescribed me an appetite suppressant for eating disorders (adderall). lots of meds can be used for lots of different things. if it works or not depends solely on you and your body, so try it out and see what happens"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Wellbutrin as first medication is unusual, even if you mentioned symptoms of depression."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,They put me on that as a child and my mother took me off of it almost immediately  I would find a new doctor. It gave me major mental issues even for the week that I was on it I didn't like it at all...
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Imo nothing helps as much as stimulants
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Welbutrin isnt an ordinary antidepressant, it works on dopamine & norepinephirine but it's still a tad bit unusual of a choice ngl"

Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Did nothing for me that I could tell
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I had some rare adverse side effects with Wellbutrin so I only took it for a week. Many psychs are hesitant to prescribe ADHD medications - I had to see my current psych for 2 years and get re-tested for ADHD before she would prescribe me a stimulant (although that's much longer than it should take!). Be patient, but be clear and firm about what you're looking for! If possible, do some research about ADHD medications before your next appt and bring up some options you've researched to your psych."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,My psych also prescribed wellbutrin directly for me. I used it for 1 month but did not feel any effects
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Made my symptoms worse.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"It helped with my mood swings and moods. My focus was about the same and hyperactivity was not helped at all. Couldn't sleep on it at all. I have depression alongside my adhd so my psych NP was curious if it could work. She had a gut feeling a stimulant was going to be the answer though due to how I am with paradoxical response to caffeine. 

I sleep better and have same control of emotions on Adderall ER and Zoloft. Hyperactivity and impulse better too and able to focus better. 

(I was one of those oddballs where straterra was VERY bad. More irritable on it than when on prednisone lol)"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I'm on Vyvanse and starting back in September i went into a really deep depression.  Last week my NP prescribed Wellbutrin for me to take along side my vyvanse. I started taking it on friday and even just these few days  of being on it have made a world of difference.    


i'm not longer getting stuck in my negative thought spirals and dwelling on things. When those thoughts do start to come to mind i'm able to catch them pretty quickly and redirect my thinking pretty easily.    


I am still in the state of euphoria that comes with the increase in dopamine levels that come with it (Vyvance increases the production and connection while Wellbutrin slows down how quickly it reabsorbs).  it'll take about 1-2 weeks to balance out.  so we'll see how everything is at that point"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"It helps depending on what environment I'm in. 

For example, while in school/hours of lectures a day, it wasn't sufficient. I didn't need help getting lectures started, I needed meds to help me stay tuned into my lectures and stimulants did this for me.

At work full time where I could bounce from task to task and manage my own time in a way that keeps me focused, Wellbutrin was sufficient. I didn't need meds to stay tuned into my tasks for hours, I needed them to get the ball rolling. 

Meds don't cure ADHD, they help people with ADHD operate in environments and profession/social structures that are unnatural to them. Depending on what parts of your environment you find challenging with ADHD is the biggest factor here. Not everyone's workplace/school have the same demands.

As for why suggest an antidepressant like Wellbutrin? In short, ADHD people don't do dopamine well (the motivation/reward chemical in your brain that drives focus). Many antidepressants are SSRI and target your seratonin (a more general feel good chemical), but Wellbutrin specifically targets your dopamine instead. This can be super useful for people with ADHD, but again, depends what they need to get out of their medication which is different for everyone."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I'm currently on a combo of Wellbutrin and Prozac (generics) for depression and anxiety, and I can't say they're helping my ADHD. I'm going to a new dr next week who will hopefully take me more seriously than the self-righteous boomer I've been seeing."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,I personally did not have a great time on it. After the second week I felt ‚Äúemotional blunting‚Äù which is not normal because you normally don‚Äôt feel anything until 2 months after.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,I have been on wellbutrin for a week so it‚Äôs super early so far I don‚Äôt see any difference in anything
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,YES!
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Wellbutrin has done wonders for my wife. I can‚Äôt take it due to my epilepsy and I take Stratera. She has sworn by it ever since she started it.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Wellbutrin did help me get through college before I knew I had adhd, but it did give me terrible insomnia and anxiety."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,It helped with my attention a bit but it made my brain get tired much faster
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I HATED Wellbutrin. It ""flatlined"" me emotionally. Meaning no highs or lows. Totally screw up my libido too.

Adderall helped me substantially more, if I am honest."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Various antidepressants are good for ADHD due to dopamine increase, therefore more motivation etc"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Wellbutrin helped a lot of my ADHD stuff but also made my anxiety so bad I couldn‚Äôt drive and could barely leave the house so uuuhhhh if you have anxiety just be aware of that possible side effect.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Wellbutrin did nothing for my ADHD, and it did nothing for my depression. Be patient, cooperate with your doctor through the initial trial, and report the results honestly. There are a few people who have good results with it and getting refills is less hassle than stimulants- so if you are one of those it would be great. If you're not unmistakably better, however, don't sugarcoat it- if the doctor just wants to poison you with a super-high dose of this stuff to avoid prescribing stimulants, immediately find yourself a new provider."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Wellbutrin made it easier to get out of bed. Ritalin helps me do my laundry. Two different amounts of motivation, but Wellbutrin was prescribed to me because I struggle with both anxiety and ADHD. I had concerns with anxiety so bad that I had a full-body rash and was out of classes my birthday week. Different things work for different bodies. I‚Äôve heard many people say Wellbutrin has worked great for them! For me, it didn‚Äôt do much but make my brain feel like gray slop, but not as depressed so I suppose that‚Äôs good.

On the contrary, I do have to deal with sensory issues, heart racing that makes me stim like mad, head tingles, modifies after it wears off, not being able to feel hungry, headaches, and other fun things that come with dehydration on Ritalin IR. Other than that, it does it‚Äôs job pretty  well! It‚Äôs the price I pay to be able to finish my homework and have the push to get going. 

I am still exploring my options to see what works the best with my body!"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Wellbutrin really just made me angry all the time
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Love my Wellbutrin and Vyvanse combo.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"It helps some, but did nothing for me.  I even doubled the dose, then doc wanted to add on another medication to help it work.  No thanks.  I want one medication to work for me - not a handful of drugs."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,I reacted with increased agitation. Didn‚Äôt work out for me.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"It was good for a long time for me but cranked my anxiety super bad when I went up in dosage! That's probably more due to having a shitty psych who, like, doubled my dose though. My partner is on it right now and says it's been working really well for him. It gave me that little boost to push past the executive dysfunction, whereas SSRI's turned me into a nauseous zombie."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,I take wellbutrin and Cymbalta. Works well for me.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,It helped me until it made my blood pressure uncontrollable and I had to stop. And now I‚Äôve had horrible anxiety and depression ever since. That was almost 3 months ago.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Not for ADHD, no. Worked very well for my depression, though."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I‚Äôm on it with a daily Adderall XR. I needed a daily anxiety med (hey! Addressing ADHD helped with that, too!) and the doc explicitly went with Wellbutrin because a lot of patients had reported attention benefits. Any med is going to work a little differently on different people, but this is at least something logical to try."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Wellbutrin worked great for my adhd, horrible for my anxiety."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"It was good for motivation, not for staying focused. It allowed me to get up and start tasks, but I needed other things to stay on task.

Also, youre probably starting at 150, in my personal experience, everyone ends up having to move up to 300. So be sensitive to when it feels like it's working less and get ready to crank it up. *Not a doctor* that's just a personal observation."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,I was on it for depression and it kinda helped but nothing compared to vyvanse or adderall.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Wellbutrin has been amazing for me.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I liked Wellbutrin, but I had to stop it when I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I couldn‚Äôt take it with the hormone therapy I need to help keep the cancer from coming back. I‚Äôm on Strattera now, which is okay."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"If you have anxiety, keep a record of your feelings. Wellbutrin was great for me for a while but then it made my anxiety worse! Everyone is different so it may be great for you! Just keep track so you're not suffering for no reason."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I tried it first and it didn't do dick all. Which sucked, because I waited like 2 years to try medication again"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Did not help me I turned into hulk and raged
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Totally helps my kid after he tried many other medications. His room is clean!
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I'm on it for my ADHD/Depression. It's worked wonders for me, I can focus better, remembering is easier, and on the plus side I've had no side effects"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"That was the first medicine I was one. I kind of worked for me, but I could only stay in it for about a week or so. It gave me such terrible dry mouth that it made me cough like crazy at night and chug water, that I was losing sleep.

For the next few medications I tried my doctor always warned me about the dry mouth, lol, but it was only ever the Wellbutrin that affected me that badly.

I think it had the potential to work for me if the side effects didn't drive me insane."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Idk how much it helps my adhd. I‚Äôm sure some. But I do know that it helps the crippling depression a TONNN. I think it prob low key helps a bit with adhd? It works on similar receptors. But it‚Äôs been the only antidepressant or to ever work for me. I am definitely an advocate for Wellbutrin, makes a HUGE difference in my life/ mood. Especially recommend if other antidepressants haven‚Äôt worked or if you have ADHD. (My mom takes it too actually, which I found interesting.)"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I've recently started on Wellbutrin too. I can definitely feel the effects on being able to stay motivated and energized and get things done without so much anxiety. However, the side effects are pretty bad. Dizziness, headache, nausea, ""air headed"" feeling have been on my back a lot."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,I take wellbutrin and vyvance and that's a very good combo for me
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"In my experience, Wellbutrin caused me anxiety spells. My main Adhd medication is Vyvanse. Maybe the combination of the two did not work. Once i stopped Wellbutrin (by chance) the anxiety went away."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Wellbutrin worked for me until it didn't anymore. I'm still taking it but on the next appointment with my doctor, I'll get prescribed a medication for ADHD specifically. That was the deal... if Wellbutrin stops working, we go for Concerta and I can't wait honestly."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I was on 100 mg for a month and then 150 for a week or so before I stopped. Can't say I felt anything. At least it's nothing compared to even Adderall xr 10 mg, which still isn't enough."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Worked for me. Don‚Äôt automatically write it off and give it a chance.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Wellbutrin didnt really help at all for ADHD and it made my anxiety way worse. My brain needs stimulant medication to actually feel better.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I had a good experience for the first month or two, although I agree with other commenters that it helped depression more than ADHD symptoms. After like 3 months though I started to have suicidal ideation for the first time in my life, and I promptly stopped using it and have felt fine since

*not having suicidal thoughts nowadays, please do not worry about me"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Wellbutrin turned me into an irritable, angry asshole for the duration of my use. It also increased my blood pressure. It's likely that they're doing this to avoid starting out with a stimulant. Just use it, report back your success or otherwise with it. You might even get prescribed strattera next which is also not a stimulant.

You'll have to keep going until you find what works. It sucks, but it's what doctors do bc they're cautious about prescribing stimulants without having tried other options first."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I take adderall, but i‚Äôm also on antidepressants. When my overall cognitive functioning was becoming less sharp, my psych put me on Wellbutrin. It made me really sick so I was only on it for like a week. He switched me to aplenzin, which is a different formulation of wellbutrin, and it works really well for me! I have a sensitive stomach so don‚Äôt let potential nausea deter you. I would say just try it and if the side effect are unbearable for whatever feels like too long for you, call the provider."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Gave me flu symptoms, and then I had horrific hives over my entire body. Extremely itchy. Constant sore head and blocked nose. Please be careful."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,They gave it to me at first and told me they prescribe wellbutrin first in hopes that it helps bc they want to rule out that the symptoms are actually for adhd and not depression before prescribing stimulants but I know ever doc is different but just sharing what I was told (: mine helped my depression a little but but the other stuff didnt go away so now i take wellbutrin and adderall unfortunately üôÉ
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,It did nothing to me. Sugar pill type stuff and I tried it twice. Congratulations to everyone who it actually worked for ü•≤
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I was on Wellbutrin for a few months. While I didn't see much benefit from an ADHD perspective, it did help with vaping.

Coming off of it was a nightmare though, as I have never experienced such crushing fatigue before, and I speak as someone with Chronic Fatigue. I was basically bedridden until I got onto Vyvanse for the ADHD."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Aw man, Wellbutrin was the tits‚Ä¶until I started itching uncontrollably all over my body. That, and I had to get an exemption from my insurance company to try the name brand (in case it was only the generic that I was allergic to) and it *still* cost $150 for a 30 day supply.

Other than that, it was great for my energy, mood and motivation. I eventually started a combo of Intuniv and Adderall. Had been using Adderall for about a year to great success and only stopped and sought alternatives because it was jacking up my blood pressure. Now that I‚Äôm using it with Intuniv, that takes care of the blood pressure part. Everyone will react differently to different medications and it‚Äôs almost impossible to know until you try."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I'm weaning myself off it for the second time. I really did try and even with a dosage increase, it did not help. I also suffer from depression and I really do think it made that much worse."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I was prescribed Wellbutrin at first as well. I tried it for a few months and had no results. That said, everyone is different. A lot of physicians are hesitant to prescribe stimulants off the bat (even though they are first line) especially if you're being diagnosed as an adult. Hopefully your psychiatrist will listen to you if it doesn't work for you. I'd stay stick it out for the month and keep an open mind, it might help you! 

Finding the right meds can be a long and frustrating process. Good luck!"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I‚Äôm currently on Wellbutrin (7 months now) and it has been great for me. It‚Äôs really not like any other antidepressant as it affects dopamine, which I think is what the stimulant medications affect. Don‚Äôt be afraid to try it. I had been on different stimulant meds for years and wish I had tried this sooner. 

If it doesn‚Äôt work for you, let your doctor know."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Yep I was prescribed sertraline which is also an antidepressant and all it did was make me feel numb and even more unproductive lmao
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Wellbutrin is an antidepressant but it is also an adhd medication. It works really well for some people!
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Did you tell your doc you go to college/uni? Because they will prescribe Wellbutrin if they feel you are trying to get ADHD meds to do better in school.

Wellbutrin does increase dopamine levels, which CAN help with ADHD, but depending on the person it may not help that much."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,no its great for my depression but does nothing for my adhd
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Yes. I have a heart problem so I needed a non-stimulant and went with Wellbutrin. I think it works just as well as adderall but without that get up and go that makes you ‚Äúknow‚Äù adderall is working, if that makes sense? I can see the evidence of it working because I exercise regularly, clean my home, and keep up with work, all in a way I wasn‚Äôt while unmedicated. But I don‚Äôt feel any different. 

I will say though, I wasn‚Äôt cautioned enough about the side effects in the beginning. The mood swings were horrible for about 3 weeks and I felt panicky and anxious. It *did* go away though."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Wellbutrin caused me lots of anxiety. Please be careful with it and have some time to adjust (dont take it right before work or anything)

I did take it as a mix of antidepressant and Adhd though, so it may be different for some, just keep an eye out of any additional jitters!!!"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I'm on Wellbutrin and Adderall, for my ADHD and Bipolar disorder, and I think its a good combo for me. The Wellbutrin made me more motivated, and the adderall gives me the focus to follow through my motivations.

Sometimes though, I'm hyperfocused to a fault (my girlfriends mom was trying to talk to me and I was transfixed to my phone screen reading something, so I didn't even acknowledge her presence. I didn't even hear her speak so she wasn't pleased haha.)

So it's a matter of finding a good balance for you."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"It worked wonders for me between 2-4 weeks in. Wonderpill essentially.

Then it gradually worn of until I didnt feel a thing."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Wellbutrin works on reward chemical dopamine. Dopamine converts into focus agent norepinephrine on an axis I forget the name of (DVA?). If your issue was a dopamine one, Wellbutrin should help. If it‚Äôs a norepinephrine one, it‚Äôll just add to your anxiety with more push ‚Äúto do‚Äù but less ability to convert that into focus. There‚Äôs a neurotransmitter test through Tempus that sheds light on our genetic snips (does your liver detox properly? Which drugs would you need more or less if based on rapid/slow processing) The other test I like is The Organic Acid test by Great Plains Laboratory that shows whether you have mold or heavy metals that would give you brain fog/ ADHD symptoms & drain your building block nutrients. It will also show other bacteria like C Difficil which happens to block proper conversion of Dopamine to Norepinephrine and could be the problem.

In general, you‚Äôll know Wellbutrin isn‚Äôt for you if you feel very activated / anxious. It‚Äôs also a bit hard to come off of so be gentle with yourself if you do decide to titrate off."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I was prescribed Wellbutrin after my diagnosis too.
I also felt like a waste of an appointment when I found that it wasn't the right fit for me just starting the semester.

I'd say give it a fair shot, some people have great success with Wellbutrin!

I kept a note on my phone of how I was feeling every day. I only took it for one week. It caused a very elevated heart rate, even when at rest. One of my days just said ""cracked out"". I felt jittery and worried all the time. I couldn't sleep because my body was jostling from my heart beating so hard. 

I stopped taking it after that week, after speaking with my provider. At our next appointment we decided to try Adderall and propranolol to help maintain heart rate and I love it! 

Sometimes it takes a while to find what works best for you. Don't think of it as a waste, you're just zeroing in on a proper treatment plan.

Good luck, and I hope you feel as happy as I do when you find what works!"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I got put on Wellbutrin for a month as an anti-depressant but it didn't nothing to help me with any ADHD related problems, nor my depression."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"It hasn‚Äôt helped me with my attention issues, but it has eased up my intrusive thoughts which has been very very helpful."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I took Wellbutrin when I was pregnant with all my kids. It didn't work very well for me so, as soon as I was done breastfeeding, I went back on my Adderall."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,I love it. I hear it makes some anxious. Only the highest dose (450mg) gives me the cognitive effect I desire.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Wellbutrin made me numb. I wasnt diagnosed at the time but was trying to get a sleep study for my chronic fatigue. Since I had nornal labs and was young and skinny my insurance wanted me to prove it wasnt depression before getting a sleep study. Antidepressants dont do anything for my energy but make it worse cuz I have to deal with a more side effects so they added Wellbutrin. I went from sleeping all day every saturday because I was so tired to sleeping all weekend because nothing was interesting and I was bored but had to pass the time. Ive had a few primary care roll their eyes at me since for saying no to wellbutrin again like its some cure-all. 

I think its weird she recomended those first. Maybe she was trying to give an alternative to a stimulant since people have mixed feelings on those? Problem is antidepressants take time to work. And time to figure out the right one with the right dosage. Srimulants take time for the latter as well, but I can still be productive while Im figuring out my med and dose. Because they take effect immediately. 

Maybe you should give her a call and discuss your concern. She may be able to prescribe something else after a phone call. As long as you discussed ADHD treatments during your appointment she could prescribe something without insurance issues as long as shes cool with it. Some drs want another appointment but hopefully that doesnt mean she wants you to have an appointment every monthly stimulant refill."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I was prescribed Wellbutrin and lasted a whole 48 hours on it. Made me get 3 hours of sleep a night, had heart palpitations, and too much restless energy. Anyone else have similar side effects?"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"My best experience has been with Vyvanse, I was never prescribed Wellbutrin. But I also have to take medication for severe anxiety/OCD and depression as well as ADHD."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I took Wellbutrin for adhd & depression. It was a horrible experience for me, made me horribly suicidal‚Ä¶. The only luck I‚Äôve had was with Adderall for the adhd"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Wellbutrin was an excellent *start* for me. The gold standard as far as my medications go is a Wellbutrin/stimulant cocktail. 

Wellbutrin is a DNRI (Dopamine Norepinephrine Re-uptake Inhibitor). 

Dopamine and Norepinephrine are both vital to the brains ability to feel stimulation, motivation, pleasure, and contentment. ADHD symptoms are often associated with low levels of those two neurotransmitters. 

So while it is true that Wellbutrin is primarily known as an antidepressant, it specifically treats the symptoms that ADHD and depression have in common. 

What it does not do is *stimulate* the brain, which is what is needed to generate focus. 

My psychiatrist likes to use a radio as a metaphor. Wellbutrin plugs the radio in (creates energy/motivation), stimulants tune the radio to get rid of static (generates focus), and cognitive behavioral techniques set the channel (direct the focus to the appropriate tasks). At the end I‚Äôve got got a working radio (executive function)."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Wellbutrin XL, for me, worked more for my depression more than anything. I still suck at trying to get things done but I'm not as depressed as I previously was. It was really bad for me before but now I can do at least basic things. Combining it with Prozac and (recently) Vyvanse, seems to be showing good signs for me when it comes to my attention. I just need to up Vyvanse dose like 10-20mg more and I think I should be able to manage better."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Doesn‚Äôt do anything for my ADHD, great for my depression tho"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,I just got prescribed that. Will let you know how it goes.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,I was started on Zoloft for my anxiety first and after a couple of months she then put me on my ADHD med. she she would have started on just my ADHD med it would have caused my anxiety to also rise and not be good.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"it didnt work for me, but it helped my mom and sister a lot."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I actually like it? I‚Äôm a month in, and it‚Äôs nice to be off the rollercoaster of stimulants‚Ä¶ they were messing with my energy. I actually now have more stable energy because I‚Äôm not burning it on super highs and super lows. Hope it works for you!"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Because it is a stimulant like medication which increase two activating catecholamines through reuptake inhibition: norepinephrine and dopamine. It is not as strong as the pure form of those ie as Strattera which is a SNRI (selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor)and Ritalin which basically a SDRI (selective dopamine uptake inhibitor).

I take 300 mg daily for major depression and related conditions (anxiety, PTSD).  

I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the medicine, but I also deal with PTSD (chronic, dissociative) and suspect the norepinephrine increase doesn‚Äôt do my PTSD any favors.

I also get tired rapidly in the day before the afternoon. I use both concerta and welbutrin. I feel like it‚Äôs too activating and just burns me out fast. Personally I‚Äôm going to see about switching the Welbutrin but I‚Äôve had poor reactions to SSRI and atypical do at that point I‚Äôm looking to unconventional meds like anticonvulsants (lamictal) or older school MAO-I antidepressants. Failing that I will switch from concerta to a non stimulating one like intuniv.

I also use lithium for agitation and anger issues which can come from both ADHD and PTSD. I pretty much have an intermittent explosive anger in response to ongoing stressors or to thining about past traumas. They try to say it‚Äôs bipolar but I don‚Äôt think it is. Regardless evidence does support lithium for anger and aggression in PTSD and ADHD so the diagnosis doesn‚Äôt really matter the meds are the same on a symptom by symptom basis."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,I enjoyed it! I had to get off of it because it wasn‚Äôt compatible with some other medication.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Fucked my anxiety. I didn‚Äôt even realize it, I thought I was more motivated but I was just anxiety motivated. And it made me more depressed which is what is was supposed to help."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Wellbutrin alone doesn‚Äôt do it for me. Been on adderallXR 20 and Wellbutrin 150 for almost a year and it‚Äôs helped me. It‚Äôll take about 2-4 weeks to see changes on the Wellbutrin, it‚Äôs good that you know what problems to look out for but hey it may work"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"It worked fantastically for me when I took it  to quit smoking. I had to discontinue after a few weeks because I couldn't sleep, otherwise I would still be on it."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I've heard it helps. But it won't act as fast as a stimulant will.

Unfortunately I would have more to say about it if i wasn't taken off of it so quickly."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I‚Äôve been on it for a few months. Didn‚Äôt notice much of a difference until I also started taking lexapro.

Still, nothing magical but a slight improvement when taking both."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,All I‚Äôll say is don‚Äôt go above 300mg
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Wellbutrin does work, but it's nothing like stimulants. Wellbutrin takes effect over a long period of time and makes it less likely for you to feel like you need something you're not getting from whatever it is that you're doing at the moment; you will not be able to ""feel like"" the drug is doing anything. It can be very helpful long term, and I have been taking it daily for years (with a few years break when I learned I really missed it). If you are not needing an immediate intervention this may be sufficient.

However, if you are encountering significant difficulties finding the motivation to do tasks which are imminently urgent and important, the positive effect that Wellbutrin is probably not going to be sufficient in the short term. For problems like this you will need to discuss alternatives to address your immediate need.

The good news is that this appointment was not a waste. It could be that Wellbutrin sufficiently addresses your issues, but maybe not. At your next appointment with your psychiatrist you can relate your experience. If you find that Wellbutrin is insufficient for what you need right now, tell the psychiatrist that. There are other options that you can discuss. You may have to advocate for yourself, but if you do it will be worth it. It's pretty common for any doctor to start with the most benign option and work up from there as needed."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Wellbutrin has been great for me. At the moment I am taking 450 mg a day, which is apparently the max dose. It helps in all the ways Adderall would help but without all of the anxiety and negative side effects. I've tried all of the stimulants and non stimulant meds and i don't really tolerate any of them even at the lowest doses. Wellbutrin can be a great option and stimulants don't necessarily work for everyone."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"For ADHD, not so much but it helped my depression immensely. It gave me energy and motivation unlike all the SSRIs I tried which made me feel constantly drained and emotionally ""gray"". Wellbutrin made me happy to be alive for the first time ever. It helped me to improve my life and stay motivated to keep improving. It had some uncomfortable side effects such as constant profuse sweating and it made me develop bruxism from grinding my teeth and jaw all the time. One thing it didn't have though was sexual side effects and anyone who's taken SSRIs too can tell you those have a lot of sexual side effects."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"ADHD symptoms can actually be symptoms of depression. I imagine she's treating you for the more common thing first. If the medication doesn't work for you, she'll likely try something else. I had my antidepressants messed with for about a year before my doctor sure it wasn't brain fog from depression."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I'm currently on wellbutrin, and I've had a couple friends who were as well.

My first friend who was on it has ADHD but not depression, he told me it ""felt strange"" and he didn't like how he couldn't take med breaks. He switched to something else.

My second friend who was on it has depression but not ADHD, she said it made her nauseous, maybe jittery as well. I don't recall if she's changed cocktails.

My experience has been positive as someone with both. I feel more motivated and less likely to hurt myself. I don't hate going to work anymore (monotonous job). I do find that I'm still a bit fidgety, maybe even anxious, but I've been able to channel that into work. When I have been spacey, I've been able to tamper that with a bit of caffeine (just be aware that wellbutrin can lower your tolerance). I'm also on the starting dose of XR.

I hope this helps!

I hope this helps!"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,I felt so bad on that. I hope it works for you.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,NO
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,It helps ish
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I also was started on Wellbutrin. You have to try medications first before some insurances/doctors are comfortable giving you a stimulant. I stopped going to that doctor and got another doctor and she was like ‚ÄúYou had 7 hours of neuropsych evals done and that doctor said its not enough‚Äù? I said yeah so she stopped by wellbutrin and started me on Vyvance. 

Granted, she is my suboxone doctor, been seeing her for years, almost off of it entirely, so we already have that trust in the doctor patient relationship. Keep trying, half the battle is finding out you have it, the other half is finding the right medication and right dose."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Wellbutrin has helped with my anxiety and depression. I also take a low dose every of Ritalin. For me, it‚Äôs a great combo. Try it and see how it goes, but don‚Äôt settle, you might need both. Keep advocating for yourself."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"wellbutrin works for some, but it made me extremely suicidal, so pls keep tabs on yourself and contact a loved one if you notice you‚Äôre getting worse. best of luck to you ‚≠êÔ∏è"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Wellbutrin severely increased my anxiety and nausea symptoms, so I went off it after ~6 months. Your reaction will likely differ, but it took me too long to realize the correlation between my anxiety nausea being the worst it‚Äôs ever been and the med - so just something to keep an eye out for."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I was put on 150mg of Wellbutrin and it really did help but not enough. It definitely helped me with energy and gave me a sense of wellbeing but it didn't help with my stimulation issues- nicotine, caffeine, binge eating etc. (even though Wellbutrin is prescribed for smoking cessation too). It also didn't help with impulsive and compulsive behavior and inattention. It was essentially just an energy and mood booster which was helpful but didn't give me the tools I needed to sort my life out- I was just a more enthusiastic disaster.

I was on Wellbutrin for 2 years and after the 1.5 year mark it stopped working altogether. They bumped me up to 300mg and it was essentially the same experience as when I started it- more energy but not helpful for anything else.

Seeing that the Wellbutrin did help in some ways my doctor decided to go back down to 150mg and add in 30mg of Vyvanse and this combination has significantly improved my quality of living. It's not perfect but it's given me the tools needed to keep the chaos at bay and do the things I need to do to be physically healthy and successful academically."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Wellbutrin worked okay for me but I have underlying issues that are yet to be diagnosed so it made me kinda all over the place and not 100% mentally. The day I quit it I cried so hard and had a lot of emotions rush me. It's worth a shot but listen to your body while you give it a try
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,I‚Äôm on Wellbutrin and low dose of vyvanse.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"300mg of Wellbutrin helped me a lot. I think it‚Äôs because it helps regulate dopamine, which is a huge part of ADHD.  It‚Äôs not likely as big of a difference as I would have had on Vyvanse or Adderall, but it definitely helped make things more manageable!"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Bupropion did not treat my adhd symptoms (or depression/anxiety) however, I have friends who found it helpful for them to get up and get going in the morning. 
Doctor then ruled that drug out since it was ineffective. Moved on to Adderall, Ritalin, and now Vyvanse. It can be a long road with lots of trial and error working with insurance, getting the diagnosis, and finding the right balance of meds. Hang in there."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"41F- In my experience of ADHD, my unregulated attention means I get VERY overstimulated and super anxious when too many sensory things are happening all at once (grocery stores and driving a car while music is playing and people are talking are actual hell.) I do also take Adderall when I need to focus, but the Bupropion (generic for Wellbutrin) has been really helpful in not getting blown out and extra anxious in everyday situations that aren‚Äôt totally focus specific. My system seems to be reacting to the outside world as less jarring/threatening in general, which means there‚Äôs less ‚Äústatic,‚Äù and more possibilities for focus and functioning. It‚Äôs also been great for my relationship, because I‚Äôm not always getting overstimulated and cranky with my partner because of the volume he likes to watch TV, etc. (I‚Äôve been on and off Bupropion once before and had no issues stopping under the supervised titration schedule recommended by my doctor.)"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I took Wellbutrin when I lived overseas and couldn‚Äôt get Adderall. It helped somewhat, but Adderall was more effective."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"The first medication I was ever prescribed for my mental health was Wellbutrin. It made me hallucinate. I had the strangest thoughts... but what made me really realize something was wrong was the M.C Escher drawing that came alive in the darkness of my room. Not only did I not possess any Escher drawings, but I couldn't stop looking at it, because it was there even with my eyes were closed"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,My boyfriend has ADHD and depression and it has been great for both of those thus far
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Wellbutrin works on similar neurotransmitters to most stimulants, but just to a different degree. I personally found that Wellbutrin worked best for me before I switched to a stimulant."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,One night of alcohol while on welbutrin guarantees me 1-2 days of severe depression about 2 or 3 days later. I had to stop drinking because of it and am much healthier physically and emotionally for it!
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"For me vyvanse felt like it wasn't working as good as when I first started maybe because I was working out then and that motivated me too...

Since starting wb it's like wb gives me the motivation to get up and go to work(my home office) Vyvanse keeps me focused when I get there else I stay in bed and get hyper focused on bloons td6.

As a side feature I don't crave chocolate as much and lost 40 pounds just because I forget to eat because I'm more focused on work etc and when I do eat it's because I'm truly hungry and I don't care even what I eat just whatever fills my tummy.

Edit: I'm on vyvanse and ADHD. And because of ADHD I didn't read the full text lol...

I'm not sure by itself it'll work as good by itself, but it's killer with vyvanse or my wife takes Adderall.

Either way I think depression is very tied to ADHD and it'll help, but you still might need more to function correctly. I wasn't medicated till I was 38 and well butrin til I was 42(this past may)."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"My first psych refused to evaluate me for ADHD unless I went completely off weed for 2+months. We tried a few different meds including Wellbutrin. It was okay but I since got a different psych and a perscreiptikn for adderall 15 mg ex. Adderall has been so much better than all the other stuff I tried (Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Buspirone)."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Wellbutrin made me feel nauseous and sick all day. constant stomach ache all day. I stopped that crap after day 3. I couldn't take it anymore!
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"It didn‚Äôt help me nearly as much as I needed.  It was alright for my depression but didn‚Äôt make a dent in my adhd.  That‚Äôs just my personal experience, I hope yours is better!"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"It has been proven as an off label treatment for ADHD. I‚Äôve never been diagnosed with ADHD, but I feel so much more productive when I‚Äôm in it."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"When I was first starting to get treated for my adhd, my physician put me on buproprion for 30 days since he ""didnt believe in prescribing stimulants"". I took it for the whole 30 days just to make sure I gave it a fair try and could prove to my doc I was willing to work with him. It was a solid no go for me. I am generally a very calm person and it made my moods fluctuate a lot and I had way more anger than ive had before. After I got off it and found a psychiatrist to work with I got on adderall and that's worked great for me. I know everyone responds differently to meds though so you might need to give things a try and adjust if they don't work for you."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,I'm bipolar type one and have adhd. I take a bunch of meds including wellbutrin. It's never helped with adhd though. Definitely need my Adderall
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"It can help. It was my most effective medication for depression/anxiety before I was diagnosed with ADHD, likely because it was treating my ADHD symptoms, lol. 

I still take it with stimulants, but it‚Äôs a good starting point. It took a few years to land on a dosage and brand of stimulants that was a good fit - some of them made me sleepy, some of them left me eating ridiculous amounts of food at night, some of them had an awful crash when they wore off - I‚Äôm actually on a 16-hour release of stimulants now, but it‚Äôs taken 5 years and multiple psychiatrists to get to this point. And often the ongoing side effects wouldn‚Äôt become obvious until after a month or two - even though it doesn‚Äôt stay in your system, it does affect your body over time (sleep and eating rhythms, etc.), so I‚Äôve found not all the side effects emerge immediately.

Wellbutrin, at least, is very consistent and will likely improve your baseline a bit (and for some people, it‚Äôs enough entirely - I mean, I functioned on it for 10 years). I also find that stimulants work a lot better for me if I take a day off here and there, so Wellbutrin helps make sure I don‚Äôt completely lose a day when I do that. 

Honestly, I would increase my dosage of it if I could. I should note that I take brand name Wellbutrin - I‚Äôve tried the generic before, and found it didn‚Äôt do anything at all (same goes for Concerta - you can usually get a card off the drug manufacturer‚Äôs web site to match the generic price; it is truly night and day for a handful of medications). I won‚Äôt take generic Concerta at all because it will immediately put me to sleep - it just releases differently than the brand name formulation, even though it contains the same amount of methylphenidate."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Aside from successfully alleviating depression, Wellbutrin does nothing for my ADHD."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Has any of you tried Cymbalta?
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Don't doubt Wellbutrin just yet. I know it is easy to focus on the antidepressant and stop smoking uses for it. My doctor broke it down as a pseudo-stimulant due to its effects on dopamine. It took me about a month for me to feel balanced with it. I have found taking it at night has helped me both get deeper sleep and be able to get out of bed in the morning when or before my alarm goes off. There is a lot of cross-over with mental health due to how much is not known.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I started it a couple of months ago and it has been great! I also have undiagnosed anxiety and overall it has helped my ADHD and almost everything else (compulsively smoking weed, anxiety, other stuff). It makes it so that I can wake up, load the dishwasher, go to work and be productive but not manic, come home, and maybe do another chore before bed and dinner instead of crashing immediately. It‚Äôs so cool watching myself be this functional"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"For a few weeks it helped with my depression that was being caused by adhd. I can work with my attention better myself. It works will for people who are willing to work with it in my experience.
Edit:typos"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Wellbutrin, like ever other ADHD medication, is hit or miss. It made my dizzy, but can work really well for people. 

I take dextro, but some people of people hate it because it is a simulant and can make anxiety worse, and can cause constant hyper fixation. 

There is not sliver bullet for ADHD. Most doctors like to start with Wellbutrin or similar because they are not class 2 narcotics."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Idk like everyone else mentions more energy and motivation but it makes me tired, more impulsive and I have zero motivation to do anything as much as I want to‚Ä¶ my psychiatrist just upped my dosage so I‚Äôll see how it goes over time but these first two days I‚Äôm tired the same way I normally would be on the lower dosage."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Not really. I'd get dizzy after taking it and it really didn't help much
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Yes. Worked great.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Adhd combined here. I was perscribed Wellbutrin for about of depression I had and was told it was supposed to help my adhd too but for me personally it didn‚Äôt do anything but make me super lethargic, lost my libido quickly and overall felt like a sack of potato‚Äôs."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,It works great for me. Not a big fan of stimulants.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Made me lose a lot of weight fyi
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"My primary doctor prescribed that for me, saying he didn't like prescribing Ritalin for adults because of heart effects. I didn't mind because I was dealing with depression too. But it did not help with my ADHD at all and I second everything people have said about the mood issues. I'll spare you the details but it got very unpleasant. Also, I gained 35 lbs on a med that's not supposed to do that.

However, this was the second time I tried buproprion. First time was 10 years earlier and I had great results. I don't know if my age or different circumstances affected it or what but for now it's scared me off meds for a while..."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"my partner just resumed taking welbutrin after a couple years of.not taking it at all or not consistently. it has helped a great deal with fixing jer sleep cycle, giving her motivation and energy and pulling her out of the deep depression. 

it doesnt solve all of the attentional issues on its own, but it has been a good first step towards improving her QoL."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,it worked for me until i got hives from it
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"It seems like a lot of doctors are starting out with things like Wellbutrin before adding or switching to stimulants. Adderall et al. are sought out by so many people for even mild symptoms or for other reasons that I can see why they are hesitant to go straight to them. 

I‚Äôve been on Wellbutrin and Adderall for a long time and, if I was forced to choose between them, I‚Äôd choose Wellbutrin. But I also struggle with depression, so maybe that‚Äôs what tilts the scales for me."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"It worked wonderfully for me! I can't use stimulants because my cardiologist recommended against it, so my choice was between Wellbutrin or Strattera. Both work really well for me but I prefer Wellbutrin because it gives me an energy boost rather than making me feel lethargic (weird, right?), and on Strattera I clench my teeth at night so bad it makes my head hurt, so I didn't wanna take it anymore and asked for a switch to Wellbutrin instead.

Wellbutrin is an atypical antidepressant, it's not an SSRI (like Prozac, Lexapro, Paxil) or an SNRI (like Effexor). It's an NDRI but it's not a stimulant. Originally it was marketed as a smoking cessation drug under the name Zyban (and still is!) but it was discovered that it has antidepressant effects, so it's used under the name Wellbutrin as an antidepressant. However, it's unique in that it can also help ADHD-type symptoms like other NDRIs can do, so it can be prescribed off-label for ADHD, and especially if you have ADHD + depression like I did at the time."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Back before I had my ADHD diagnosis I was being treated for depression.  Wellbutrin was the ONLY medication that helped me.  It wasn't until many years later that I learned about its off-label use as an ADHD treatment.  In retrospect it made perfect sense.  I wasn't so much depressed as I was disorganized and resentful. 

My son has ADHD with anxiety.  We are using wellbutrin to treat them both and the results have been decent.  Nothing miraculous, but we're keeping him on a low dose to mitigate the risk of side effects."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Didn't do anything for me. :(
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I'm currently taking 300mg of wellbutrin right now, when I first took 150 mg for 2 week the first week I felt really happy and not anxious that helped me with a little motivation to start work but did not help my lack of attention at all. I did experence a little insomnia for the first 3 days but that's it. After I took 300mg I still felt nothing but I also lost my appetite completely and have lost about 15lbs so far. My next appointment is Nov 4th I will be still taking it by then. lol I hope to lose 5lbs more by the time of my next appointment ü§ûüèΩ"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"You have to remember that everyone is different and you MUST advocate for yourself if something isn‚Äôt working and try something else until you find what works. What works for someone else might not work for you. 

With that being said, I am on 300XL of Wellbutrin and 10xl Dexedrine. It has worked wonders for me after 25 years of struggling with other stimulants. I‚Äôve tried almost everything under the sun and I finally feel like I‚Äôm on what‚Äôs best for me. With both of those medications I did struggle with the side effects big time, but I pushed through and now I am fine. Again though, it took along time of trying different things and looking into different options with my psychiatrist."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I think you should take it as prescribed, keep your doctor informed and if/when (I'm skeptical here) it doesn't work for ADHD, you'll be able to share that with your psychiatrist. Doctors are hesitant to write scripts for the major adhd medications. It's infuriating to me when it keeps people from the medication they need at the end of the line."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I actually asked my doctor to let me try Wellbutrin because I have both ADHD and depression. She was hesitant because it‚Äôs typically either a godsend or awful medication depending on who you are. My hope was that I could whittle my medications down to one pill a day instead of two. Unfortunately it seemed like it did absolutely nothing for my depression. I can‚Äôt speak to how it affected my ADHD because I was still on Focalin at the time. Other than that, it seemed to make me panic quickly. So I was in this constant mood-swingy pattern where I‚Äôd be panicking over nothing, then assume the worst and get really down.

Wellbutrin seems to be a very polarizing medication. I read a lot of great reviews when I researched it. I agree with the other people here saying to not write it off just yet. A lot of medications are used off-label for other ailments, and Wellbutrin is just an anti-depressant used off-label to treat ADHD. Try to give it the month, but if you feel worse after a few days, give your psychiatrist a call immediately. I hope it works out for you!"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Works for me I was on it for about a year. Helped with ADHD and depression.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I'm on 300mg xlWellbutrin but also have a script for 50mg of vyvanse. I don't take my vyvanse daily but when I do I can power through like 10-12 hours of work/chores/whatever much easier than just on wellbutrin. On the other side of that, when I was not on wellbutrin I was doing even worse productivity wise than when I'm just taking the wellbutrin. So, I'm better with it but much better with the added adhd specific medication. Maybe test it out and see how it works for you. I like having both though honestly."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Sometimes treating the depression symptoms is more important or it can help with certain issues you‚Äôre facing. Also a lot of insurance companies require doctors to prescribe a non-stimulant treatment first to see if they can use a cheaper option. Shitty on the insurance companies part but oh well
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Love that I saw this! I take Wellbutrin and it‚Äôs helped me a lot. I have a lot more energy and I don‚Äôt fall asleep in lectures anymore which was a really big problem for me. Because I needed it, it worked very quickly. I remember looking at the computer to find something and quickly noticing my mind was quiet, and I actually felt focused. Rare for me, I wish I started it sooner!

I must say I have a lot of anxiety and I‚Äôm sure ADHD and anxiety was causing me a lot of depression and stress."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Honestly I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve noticed any difference being on it. 150mg for 1.5-3 month, then 300. Except it gave me a certain kind of nausea that‚Äôs hard to describe. But take it with a grain of salt, I had a lot of shit go down and had major changes in my life (breakup). Maybe the Wellbutrin was a catalyst for me to break things off, maybe not. 

However when I came off of it I was extremely sleepy and was able to sleep 10-12 hours and then have another nap after class. That was for a week when CVS didn‚Äôt automatically refill it for some reason."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Works great for me
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I am currently on Wellbutrin for my ADHD and have been for about 6 or 7 years. It is the only medication that has provided me with as close to 24/7 coverage as I can get. 

It keeps me motivated and focused just enough to allow me to keep my life functional naturally while leaving room for me to build discipline and systems to keep my life organized. There is no other medication that has really worked for my lifestyle (i.e. stims that last 8 hours just isn‚Äôt enough to get me through the day). 

I ride the ups and downs hard on regular stims and my activity level was too long for any other meds on the market. Every time I have tried coming off it things get way out of hand. I recommend the XL. It builds up in your system and even if you don‚Äôt have it one day you‚Äôll still be fine until your next dose.

I have had a life changing experience with it. Hope the best for you. Highly recommend as an alternative to heavy stims.

Edit: I will say that that my daily stack includes Zoloft for anxiety. I also have 5mg Adderall on hand for when it is truly something at work I can‚Äôt fuck up. Maintaining focus sometimes means taking care of some of the other symptoms like anxiety, stress, and daily structure. Or being able to call an audible and add ‚Äúextra‚Äù at the times it is needed.

As many others have stated here it is not a med you want to come off immediately. The times I have come off to suddenly I do get ‚Äúbrain zaps‚Äù. So work with your Dr. if deciding to come off it.

Also, final thought. It is truly a med that I didn‚Äôt see the full benefits until about 4 weeks in the first time I started taking it. It is something you need to be patient with if you want to see the most benefit."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"It may help you with some symptoms and determine whether you really have ADHD or some sort of atypical depression and other chemical imbalance. All people react to medication differently, but if you truly have ADHD and want it medically treated Wellbutrin is not and will never be a valid treatment alone. They are simply filtering out any other causes of your symptoms and/or avoiding prescribing a controlled substance."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I am in the same position 

I told my new psychiatrist I rather be unmedicated 

Just need school accommodations which she did for me at the university 

But she suggested trying wellbutrin in the mean time because I've never been actually treated for ADHD 

(I have taken it before in the past like 9 years ago when I was like 19 and I can't remember if it helped or didn't have side effects cuz at that time I didn't know I had ADHD and was being given medications to try left and right üò¨)

I think I have a slight memory of that medication because I knew it was supposed to help with smoking and I may have stopped it because "" it didn't DO anything"" but maybe I just felt normal? 

I still don't have the desire to try it even after a these years 

I'm very sensitive and playing with my brain chemistry is a big boundary for me (had bad experiences with Xanax withdrawl, had no idea what Xanax even was but took for anxiety and was not informed). Rather fidget, vitamins, herbs, exercise, therapy, and self talk my way thru surviving this until I can manage to commit to meds.

Everyone is different though 
So if I impulsively try I'll let you know aha üòÖ"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Well Turin made my hair fall out really badly. It helped a lot with my binge eating tho. If you notice hair falling out don‚Äôt ignore it. Didn‚Äôt do much for my add or depression tho.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I've been on Wellbutrin for three years, it being the only antidepressant that made a difference with my 'depression' clued me into the fact that I have ADHD. I recently got paperwork confirming a diagnosis when I was nine, and I actually have to switch off of Wellbutrin, but not because it doesn't work. It does work, 100% for me, not necessarily perfectly, but I've been able to enjoy life and not struggle all the time. I need the instant release formula, otherwise it does nothing for me. In my case, I've realized my dose causes me to have what I'm pretty sure are minor seizures. I've been on it for three years because it took me a while to realize it, since it doesn't really seem like a seizure, but having sudden bouts of impending doom and depression, with full body tingling and buzzing with intense tinnitus, and flashing in my vision with eye twitches and stuff, I wrote it off for a while. Wellbutrin doesn't have FDA approval for ADHD treatment, but it works similar to Ritalin, just not as strongly, and some doctors do prescribe it to help. Also, you can get three months of meds vs one month of meds. Keep an eye on any side effects, drink plenty of water and make sure you replace electrolytes, as I sweated a bit more and ended up dizzy for a few months before I realized why. I say it's a good med, I'm currently taking half doses until I can see my doctor again with my proof of diagnosis, and I hope it's enough.

I'd say give it a month or two, and if isn't helping, you can try to get a different med. Your doctor might be trying to be careful about those who DON'T have it and just want the meds. You can even ask about maybe trying something like strattera (it also works similar to Wellbutrin but mixing them doesn't always work, although you can try, it synergizes for some) so they know you just want to find something that works. I initially was going to ask to try strattera with Wellbutrin, but the eye stuff and possible seizures have me nervous to stay on it for too much longer. I've been adamant about being on Wellbutrin, because it's actually worked, until I finally got my diagnosis."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Wellbutrin XR was great for me til it wasn't. I was 2 months in and started getting huge anger irritability issues if I forgot to take it. I tried to start weaning off since I didn't like the anger and I had a full day of depression and suicidal thoughts and constant crying. I stopped cold turkey after that. Totally fine just exhausted the next 2 weeks. 

I think the lowest dose of XR (130) was too much for me. I have the regular dose 75mg hanging around but too scared to take it from my last experience. I think it was too much because even though a non stimulant, my heart was racing a bit when I first started the XR lowest dose. But I'm also super sensitive to medication and it usually works immediately for me.

But that's just me. You won't know til you try. I loved it when it did work though. I felt GREAT and happy! My depression and anxiety was way down, energy was up, I woke up RESTED AND READY FOR THE DAY AND HAPPY. It was weird and wonderful. I could focus and my emotions weren't everywhere. Then again, I had the irritability and anger issues."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"If the first line treatment for ADHD selected is a non-stimulant option then that means they either don't advocate the use of stimulants in treatment of ADHD, don't believe that you in fact have ADHD, or you've mentioned some sort of other condition to them which makes prescribing stimulants a risk, like a history of abuse with stimulants in particular, a heart condition, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, extreme anxiety disorder or the like"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Trust your doctor. Untreated ADHD will give you anxiety and depression or both. You need to be on a good mental estate to better differentiate what is what.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"oh dear. i have had doctors prescribe me anti depressants for adhd before. i worked up the courage to tell them no. told them, im not depressed. so i told them i wont take any more anti depressants, as ADHD is not depression. totally different"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Straight up, Wellbutrin helped me get myself into and through therapy. I wouldn't have gone or had any real success without it."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,I‚Äôm on generic adderall 20mg XL. I‚Äôm supposed to also be on Wellbutrin because no adhd med has really done anything for me and my psych said that maybe a combination of the two could work. I wouldn‚Äôt know because I haven‚Äôt picked up the prescription yet for like 2 weeks now‚Ä¶. Lol
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Wellbutrin also works on dopamine so thats why it helps some with ADHD, it‚Äôs different from other anti depressants"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I know it is sometimes used for ADHD. I can't stand the stuff myself, makes me frantic."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"It didn‚Äôt work for me, but I also didn‚Äôt take it correctly and consistently.  Nothing works forever. All medication will eventually need adjusting or something else entirely. It sucks to reach the point where it‚Äôs just not working anymore."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Anyone else have very vivid lucid dreaming??? Omg I loved that it amplified it...

Oh and if you don't know... Lucid dreaming you have some what control over what happens..it's lived in real time almost and that's because you are technically conscious...think inception...
If you have ever woken up in the middle of the night . Panic or scared, aroused or physically/emotionally different.. that was a lucid dream..

For the first two weeks, every night.. now I had been on a hyper focus kick the year prior, learning about better sleep practices and was doing yoga ( do judge, it's helpful.. ask your mom ;) )  lucid dreaming was a topic learned about . And could control it somewhat.. but for a few minutes..

Wellbutrin amplified this and would full control lucid dreaming.. like even flying.. for what felt like hours...

Anyone else??"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I was on Wellbutrin for 7 years. didn‚Äôt even know it was prescribed for ADHD, and based on my personal experience with it, Idk why it would be prescribed for ADHD. it worked fine as an antidepressant until I no longer needed it."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Vyvanse and welbutrin here.  JUST a heads up. Becareful with welbutrin. I came off of it once and the withdrawal symptoms were horrid.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I love it. Every med reacts differently in every brain, but I can say for me personally it‚Äôs been a game changer for my executive functioning"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"My doctor recommended I possibly try Wellbutrin, I‚Äôm already prescribed adderall and I‚Äôm a little nervous to do both. Anyone have any experience with both?"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I've been taking it for about 10 months and I experienced super bad ringing in my ears. It's a non-common side effect, and I thought I damaged my hearing and had tinnitus at first."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Just added welbutrin to my medications and it works well for me. Usually psychiatrists like to treat the depression first because it can present as a lot of ofher diagnoses (including psychosis)
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Wellbutrin worked well for me. The biggest changes I noticed right away were that I was suddenly able to sleep and wake up feeling well rested on a regular cycle (something I had NEVER been able to do for my entire life), and I started to have enough energy to start doing things I would have put off indefinitely before. I took me about 6 weeks to see the full positive effects, but I had strong side effects for the first week or two, so that‚Äôs something to look out for (mood swings, cramps, loss of appetite, etc.) The side effects went away though."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"It made me feel as good as I have ever felt in my life. Then I got a constant, painful itch, and I had to quit."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Adderall: promotes pre-synaptic release of dopamine/norepinephrine. 

Wellbutrin: promotes increased availability of dopamine/norepinephrine by inhibiting the reuptake/degradation of it. 

Different mechanism, essentially doing the same thing. It‚Äôs harder to accept/realize that Wellbutrin can actually work because it doesn‚Äôt make you cracked out and on go-mode. It‚Äôs subtle but essentially doing the exact same thing."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"This was what I was prescribed. It helped a bit, did give me a bit more motivation. I was on it for about 3 months. I had terrible mood swings and excessive sweating however, which in the long run was not worth it for me. I was on 300mg XR when I stopped. I‚Äôm now on vyvanse and it‚Äôs helped, but I‚Äôm still trying to find the right dosing. The best thing about Wellbutrin, was that I had way more energy throughout the day with it being a 24 hr type pill. I couldn‚Äôt do the constant sweating though‚Ä¶it really sucked."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Personally, I hated it and it made me ragey and angry and I almost lost my relationship over it. Once I came off of it, things stabilized and I felt much better."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"This is my personal experience so take it with a grain of salt. The 150 mg dose helped me with my depression and did nothing for my ADHD. The 300 mg dose helped me with the ADHD, almost feeling like a good dose of continuous Adderall without the side effects. 

I now have like 200 mg of caffeine each morning to get me relaxed and in a good mood. Don't have caffeine when starting up or raising your Wellbutrin dose. I learned that the hard way. Bad panic attack. 

The first few days on Wellbutrin or raised dose felt so energized, euphoric, etc. Don't get used to that though as it doesn't last long and one shouldn't chase the high. I didn't need to take the 150 with food, but I had to with the 300 or my stomach would be upset for the entire day. 

I'm glad that it works for me because I can have 3 month supplies and refills that tend to be filled around a month before my supply runs out, so I don't have to worry that much about running out."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"That's sort of for your insurance. Wellbutrin is 'safer' than stimulant medication so they would rather have you on that than say Adderall. Most people I know who are now on Adderall or Vyvanse had to try Wellbutrin first.

Wellbutrin is a great medicine though! It worked very well for me but unfortunately I'm very prone to insomnia and it did me no favors there. Adderall leaves my system fast enough so that's what I'm currently settled on for now."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Hey! I was given Wellbutrin for off label ADHD use in mid September! I only took it got 2 weeks and I couldn‚Äôt tolerate the night sweats it gave me.

Just wasn‚Äôt worth it for what I needed. Didn‚Äôt help with my focus or memory in the slightest, but I did feel much more quiet in my head. And a bit more.. calm and level. Hard to explain.

But today I got a new doctor and I‚Äôve got Vyvanse in hand, so things are looking up!"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Wellbutrin was horrible for me, I currently can't have stimulant meds either so instead I'm on a mix of Clonidine (Catapres) and Buspirone (BuSpar)."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I had a super negative effect to wellbutrin. maybe it wasn‚Äôt high enough dosage or i was just in a super bad mental, but when i took it had counter effects. I was less tha motivated, no drive, it was hard to get tasks done. I do have adhd and for some reason it just didn‚Äôt work for me"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"It has worked very well for me. Stimulants are not an option for me due to another condition, so Wellbutrin was the first thing I tried and it has really helped. 

It's not a magic bullet- I still have years of inefficient habits to unlearn- but it makes it possible for me to focus when I try to, and I feel much more energized on it.

Maybe stimulants would have worked even better, who knows; but since they might also kill me, I'm glad my doc was willing to consider Wellbutrin off label."

Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,It had absolutely zero effect for me. Wasn't until I was put on 30mg of Vyvanse that anything changed for me.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,I found it helped for about four months then it didn‚Äôt really do much at all anymore so I stopped taking it and haven‚Äôt started with something new.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"It works okay, but nowhere near what stimulants do for me. Some people take both and find success with that. 

I do think that‚Äôs unfair they didn‚Äôt give you options because wellbutrin takes up to two months for it to work. And all of that time in between, you‚Äôre dealing with side effects. Next month, really advocate for stimulants."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"dint do shit for me , waste of time , jsut triggeted depresonalization"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,You are basing your opinion on an outcome that you have yet to experience based on what you read on the internet. Listen to your psychiatrist and go through the treatment they have suggested to determine if something does or doesn't work for you before you go looking for advice from random strangers on the internet.  You could potentially be dismissing a treatment that could very well help you because you are looking someone else's experience for validation instead of your own.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"At a low dose of 100mg SR, it works great for me. 

For reference:  I‚Äôve been on ADD meds since 2006."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I‚Äôm 30, diagnosed at 12. Wellbutrin for the past 3 years and this is the most in control to manage day to day responsibilities in but still myself I‚Äôve ever felt."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I just started about 3 weeks ago, and I‚Äôm finding it surprisingly helpful. I take 1 1/2 of the lowest-dose pills in the morning. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶magic. I also take 1/2 pill of the lowest dose Adderall at that time, and 1/4 four hours later. It makes me feel more like myself, and I‚Äôm super anti-drug. 
I had to adjust my dosage downward from what the psychiatrist prescribed. 
Wellbutrin isn‚Äôt an SSRI; it works on different brain chemistry. If that helps‚Ä¶"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I'm on it for depression and it helps with that, but it hasn't done shit for my attention/executive function issues."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"It has been really helpful for me, but I‚Äôm only taking the XL and may need to go up in dosage to help my ADHD a bit better."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I also started on Wellbutrin, and it did/ does work well for me! After a few months of Wellbutrin, I was also prescribed adderall though because I was still having focusing and executive dysfunction issues"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"So my story is a bit different in that I have been on stimulants for my ADHD currently Vyvanse, and recently added Wellbutrin for depression and hopefully an energy boost. I was in a car accident that has been causing prolonged symptoms and leaving me feeling hopeless and fatigued among other things.

I have a constant headache with Wellbutrin that does not respond to OTC pain relievers, this has worsened with a dosage increase.

My mood is better than before and I am less prone to cry over nothing. I unfortunately don't feel increased energy. I do notice that it is a bit easier to initiate tasks. However if I forget my meds, the swing is awful and I am pretty much non-functional for the day. (But as mentioned I have a ton of things going on at the moment)"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,I feel like my case is a lil confusing just a warning. Wellbutrin made my thoughts race and feel uncontrollable. I was prescribed adderall and it made my mind feel quiet and like I could have single trains of thought. I find it a little ironic but that's just me. I thought I'd share bc YMMV.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I use it and vyvanse.  It helps with my task initiations and my ability to do a couple of things without forgetting the big picture. 

It also reduces the overwhelming crashes that I have that typically trigger migraines."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I started wb solely for depression before having adhd was even a thought that crossed me or my doctors mind.

It pushed me slightly out of the slump, by slump I mean a combination of heavy lack of motivation and sluggishness. But the inattentiveness didn't seem to change all that much
(this may be due to the fact that at the time I wasnt monitoring that specifically bc I didn't know), my impulsivity lowered quite a bit though.

For a long time I didn't want to get better so I didn't put in an effort, but when I did start to I got a lot of motivation back but still had heavy inattentive symptoms and a hard time plowing through things that weren't stimulating enough

My whole life I've had a weird buzzyness of thoughts bouncing around that was milding overwhelming and strained my brain quite a bit. Wb made it worse gradually overtime.
About a week ago I started Vyvanse and it's almost completely stopped it. It also decreased the amount of times I zone out. Before vyv I had a harm time getting school work done at home because it was really hard to focus but now I can fairly easy

Tldr: wb is not enough alone. It can aid in motivation if you work with it, but you need an actual adhd med to address the inattentive aspect"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I was on wellbutrin before my adhd diagnosis. It didn't work, but felt better than the Ssris"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,I take Wellbutrin because I experience very severe rejection sensitivity but also I use it on top of my adderall perscription. I kind of wished I had tried Wellbutrin first because now I rely so heavily on the adderall. Give it a shot but also know that if it doesn‚Äôt help everything you can ask about stimulants like adderall
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,I took 100mg for a couple years for my depression. I went to 150mg & my anxiety was off the walls. I stopped taking it because my depression got better. It did help my depression at the time & gave me a tiny bit of energy. Didn‚Äôt help me not want to smoke or eat. I can‚Äôt say it helped my ADHD because my dose was super low.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I am on a combo of Wellbutrin and Vyvanse and I find the combo is the best I‚Äôve tried so far in managing my adhd. Sometimes if I don‚Äôt have tasks or a way to stay busy, I feel anxious and jittery but it‚Äôs a good way to keep active I suppose lol"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,My mom loves it for her adhd. Never cut it for me.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,It is my understanding that Wellbutrin is typically prescribed when a person thinks they may have ADHD but doesn‚Äôt have a diagnosis yet. Some people respond really well to it - not me. After I finished the testing for ADHD they put me on a stimulant that works better for me.

Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Everyone is different, please keep in mind. Even same medication works differently to different people. Taking suggestions about medication with a someone else beside your doctor is wrong way. I just share my ADHD symptoms to my doctor because everyone has different symptoms with different level."

Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Wellbutrin was great for awhile, but it lost its lustre due to tinnitus symptoms which went away a lot after stopping the med. I also realised after stopping it that it made my compulsions calm down a wee bit more, too."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Wellbutrin sucked so bad for me. But that doesn't mean it won't work for you.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,probably because of the adderall shortage- doctors are having to work around it with different prescriptions/dosages. mine told me next month i wont get my 15mg XR adderall so we'll have to workoit a different solution or dosage unfortunately. i hope your prescription ends up making you feel better! keep us updated ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"It's because you went through your university, they look for any and every reason to not prescribe Adderall as it's an abused substance. You'll probably have to sit through the 4-6 weeks for the medication trial period before they will talk about anything else"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I started with Bupropion 150 mg once a day on Thursday the 13th Oct. On Saturday, I had what was the most productive day in my life. I could follow through my thoughts, actually do the tasks I planned to and it was such a huge difference. It went on for a week. I could wake up earlier, was brushing my teeth twice a day without scolding myself internally and actually could pay attention in the work meetings.  

However, when my PMS started, all the benefits basically vanished and I started feeling awful. The noise in my mind was back with a vengeance, I felt shitty all the time,could barely get out of bed, was annoyed and sad all the time. Basically like my normal PMS had been exposed to Gamma radiation----and my periods are still not here (almost a week too late which never happens). Read on other reddit posts that this happens to a lot of women. 

So two days ago, I stopped taking it. I am feeling slightly better today... but the dark thoughts are still there. I have to wait till mid November to meet my doctor, will see what happens then."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I haven't taken it, but for understanding the different med  options - and the neuroscience of ADHD in general, I really enjoyed the book "" Attention Deficit Disorder: The Unfocused Mind in Children and Adults‚Äù by TE Brown

There could be a reason why but it's worth just asking them again to better explain?"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Ten years before I got diagnosed at 41, I was prescribed Wellbutrin for depression/anxiety caused by overwhelm from juggling nursing school and being a single mom, while living with in-laws after my husband and I split up. It helped get me through and gave me the energy to power through."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"The best thing to do is learn enough about ADHD that you can be your own advocate for your health.

With that being said, treating comorbid conditions with ADHD should always come first. They always exacerbate ADHD. The most common comorbidity is depression.

With that being said I would ask my doctor if they are prescribing bupropion to treat a comorbidity. If the answer is no I would then ask my doctor why they are not prescribing a stimulant. Stimulants are proven to be the best way for treating adhd and it‚Äôs where you should start.

Personally I started with bupropion because 1. I didn‚Äôt know better. And 2 I couldn‚Äôt afford the cost of diagnosis in my area. Bupropion didn‚Äôt work well for me but did work some. It also gave me vivid nightmares. Anyways, I stopped using it and have switched to straterra and it seems to work much better. I get diagnosed on the 8th so I‚Äôm going to have to think hard about whether I‚Äôm going to start stimulants or not."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Wow. We have the exact same story except my prescription wasn‚Äôt prescribed to help ADHD but to address depression and anxiety first since those can affect focus and attention. I almost didn‚Äôt accept it cause I wanted to treat my ADHD as I have suffered my whole life. It sucks being at the beginning of this process. A process I started a year ago just to get on insurance. I am thankful that it MAY help though! ü§ûüèº

Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Nope.
 
Wellbutrin has not done a damn thing for me, but it seems like a pre-requisite to getting anything effective. I‚Äôm on 450mg/day

It has been 18months since I began diligently pursuing effective treatment. (If it weren‚Äôt for  Tricare (military socialized medicine) I would have given up on this struggle. 

I‚Äôm continually concerned about not looking like a drug seeker & agreeing to whatever meager incremental steps & stalls my psych NP dishes out.

It helped me lose 70 lbs and works better for me than Adderall. 10mg of Adderall helped, but you shouldn‚Äôt take it everyday and I appreciate that Wellbutrin is a daily drug. I need help managing my ADHD every single day so that is a huge bonus. At 450 mg, I went from desperately needing a coffee every morning to finding caffeine overwhelming. After a while at this dose, I enjoy some coffee when I‚Äôm really tired, but do not ‚Äúneed‚Äù it or use it often. Compared to Lexapro, this drug is a godsend. I‚Äôve had similar side effects to 10-20mg of Adderall, like clenching jaw and muscle tightness. But considering that weight management has been my biggest concern and this is the only medicine that manages my ADHD binge eating. It has taken the giant spike of dopamine out of food so I can finally treat it like a normal person and that is a blessing."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I take Wellbutrin, Vaydor, trintellix, and Mydaysis together anyone else???"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,This is the best description for what I experienced with Wellbutrin
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I was started at a low dose to compliment my ADHD stim-meds.  It does work for me very well, however I will play a bit of a devil's advocate here just to balance the comments.

With Bupropion (generic for Wellbutrin), or any other NDRI drugs, I personally have found that it tends to give me negative side effects at higher doses.  I had been on 300mg XR for a bit, and it made me incredibly fast tempered and moody.  Now that I am at 150mg XR, it seems to work much better for me without those negative side effects from the increased nor-epinephrine within the limbic system.

Another downside that I should mention, not to scare anyone, but I at one time attempted to come off of Wellbutrin (this was during the time I was taking a high dose and thought that the medication simply wasn't right for me) -when I attempted to come off of it, the emotional side effects of the withdrawal can be incredibly grueling.  Insanely low energy, and debilitating depression.

Therefore, if anyone decides the drug is not for them, please consult your Psych immediately to possibly have something else just for those several months until the brain chemistry begins pumping normally again."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"same here! i still need the help of Adderall for studying and working and stuff like that, but Wellbutrin helps me be a functioning person without it!"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,So would the consensus be that it can help with initiation? That‚Äôs my biggest issue.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I totally agree! Good for more energy, not so great on improving attention."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"You have described the experience really well. Wellbutrin has been good, I probably need more help if I'm going to actually manage my ADHD but it's definitely taken the edge off some of the problems because I've got a little more motivation to throw at it"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,This is exactly how I feel on it!
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Same
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,This.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Yep, this is what it's like for me too!

I also take Vyvanse on some days as well."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Find another doctor for a second opinion.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,This was exactly it for me. I loved it but it ended up being the root cause of PMDD which made me almost commit myself to a psych ward. üò≥
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Same, I‚Äôve been on wellbutrin for over a year now and while I‚Äôve noticed that I still have symptoms it‚Äôs definitely helped me with motivation and a little with my restlessness. I have noticed though that recently some of my symptoms it originally helped with have been returning, albeit not as intensely as before."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"On meds or off meds, I still need calendar appts for all the things. Like laundry or doctor appts. Or cleaning up the house."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I may need to talk to my doctor about trying this. Motivation and energy are my big downfalls and stimulants have had horrible side effects for me. I am apparently out of options for stimulant medications where I live (Concerta - reflux, Vyvanse - extreme weight loss, Adderall - spiked heart rate to over 100 for hours, Foquest - depression). 

I have coping mechanisms, I just run out of the ability to use them by early afternoon. I just seem to run out of energy and am to exhausted to continue."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Yes, I had a similar experience. I actually take a small dose of stims on top of it sometimes, but im also autistic, and while stims turn down my adhd, they turn up my autism. Being able to take Wellbutrin daily allows me to manage adhd,  no matter what, and then I just use stims as needed."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Wow I wish this is what it did for me. I upped the dose to give it a second chance and it was still as useful as eating candy. :/
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Wellbutrin was described to me by the person who prescribed it as ""a one-two punch"" against both ADHD and Depression, without the side effects of Stimulants (so at the time, I was only on Wellbutrin and nothing else). While it did seem to help ~a little~ it didn't do much for my focus. Caffeine was always my go-to for ""self-medicating"" but the crash after really really sucks... In the end, Wellbutrin didn't work out for me but it may work for someone else. Body chemistry is different for everyone."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,This is how I felt on it! Did you ever find anything to help with the attentional issues or do you just try to practice good coping skills?
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Same. Well said. Perfectly describes what I experienced as well.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,">I guess it helps with impulse control/dopamine regulation?

Yup - I was prescribed it for my BED and it had the benefit of helping with my undiagnosed ADHD symptoms."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"~~It actually more or less effects Nor-epinephrine which in turn can spike dopamine production by getting that ""get up and go"" feeling from the fight-or-flight response your limbic system gets with Bupropion.~~  This is a large aspect of any SNRI as opposed to SSRIs.  The N standing for nor-adrenaline AKA nor-epinephrine, and the S in SSRI standing for serotonin.

EDIT: Bupropion is an NDRI and not an SNRI.  NDRIs do effect both brain chemicals, instead of a waterfall effect from the Nor-ep production.  Thank you commenter!

examples of SNRIs would be Cymbalta, Pristiq Effexor etc."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,[removed]
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Did you have strong side effects from the usual meds? You may have been getting too much norepinephrine/dopamine from proper stimulants - bupropion is a more gentle way to get the same neurotransmitters.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"My favorite is trazodone. It's a great sleep aid, but when doctors prescribe it they always say something like ""it's supposed to be an antidepressant, but it doesn't work, so we just prescribe it for the side-effect""."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"It‚Äôs also very fascinating, Wellbutrin also acts on nicotinic receptors, which is of course why it works for smoking cessation.  But there are theories/research on ADHD being at least partly a reward processing disorder, and so a lot of things that help with addictions sometimes work for ADHD too, to some degree or another."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"There is off-label and then there is approved/licensed. 

Topiramate is licensed for migraines and many anti-epilepsy drugs are licensed for bipolar. 

Both Venlafaxine and Bupropion are used off-label for ADHD.   It could be due to the fact generic formulations came out before they did any research into them for ADHD."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Wellbutrin is not approved for ADHD. Not enough high quality studies have been done to show a clear improvement in improving ADHD symptoms. It's prescribed off label and does help some sufferers.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,As an aside it really really helps with food cravings and overeating too... An added bonus which I think is related to the smoking cessation aspects.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"To add to the examples, I'm sure everyone has heard about Plaquenil/Hydroxychloroquine by now right? Plaquenil is an anti-malarial drug but is often the first medication a lot of people with autoimmune conditions get put on."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Basically all migraine preventative treatments are drugs designed for other uses that had a happy side effect of ""oh look this reduces migraines!""

My own is technically an antidepressant, also used for nerve pain disorders"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,It definitely takes 4-6 weeks to fully take effect but there is a little boost the first few weeks for some people. I  take med breaks in the summer sometimes so I get it when I restart.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I hear you on the hoops to get a prescription for stimulants, but the problem is it doesn't stop there.

I get my bupropion mailed to me every 90 days for like, $10. 

While rules vary, where I am, stimulants can't have more than 30 day RX, you need a doctor's visit every three months, they can't be sent through the mail so have to go into the pharmacy and wait there every time, and overall they are a huge PITA. 

So if bupropion works for someone, it's a FAR easier prescription from a practical perspective. Stimulant prescriptions are like someone wondered how best to punish people with ADHD and implemented as many roadblocks as possible"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,It is absolutely an ADHD medication. There is no one to pay for a secondary license for it but there have been clinical trials on it's efficacy for ADHD which is why it's used off-label. Straterra/Wellbutrin are often tried first as they don't the cardiovascular risk attached.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,What kind of hoops? I might have to go through this soon as well
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"They did me cause I got diagnosed with moderate depression as well, they were trying to kill two birds with one pill."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"do you mean ""non-stimulant""? Strattera is not a stimulant."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Strattera isn't a stimulant. I'm in recovery so they won't prescribe me a stimulant which is why I'm on Strattera.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"It‚Äôs no longer ‚Äúoff label‚Äù for adhd. It‚Äôs been ‚Äúon label‚Äù since at least 2015, according to epocrates."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"my provider‚Äôs standard was to first try everything before prescribing stimulants for whatever weird reason (probably because i live in a high substance abuse area and a LOT of people got sued for overprescribing opioids) so i had to do 1. wellbutrin 2. strattera and THEN finally after months and months of misery 3. adderall. 

terrible, awful, no good, very bad side effects that i was told to wait out for two months to see if it would level out. if i didn‚Äôt take my wellbutrin exactly at the same time every day i felt like when frodo put the ring on. strattera made it impossible to eat more than two bites of food a day, gave me horrible constipation and if i was sitting down i‚Äôd start snoozing. 

i don‚Äôt want to discourage OP about giving things a shot, but please speak up if something‚Äôs not working for you, and don‚Äôt let them tell you that you have to waste months of your life to see if some side effects go away. i had so much trouble describing my symptoms because everything was so bad i couldn‚Äôt remember what i felt like before, and the dr.  would only ask pointed questions like ‚Äúhow‚Äôs your focus/how‚Äôs your mood/how‚Äôs your memory‚Äù and make all her decisions based off how i answered those questions rather than having an open ended conversation about how i was doing generally. if she was going to pull out some other non-stimulant medication after that strattera i was prepared to beg to skip it or find another doctor or give up on trying to get meds entirely. when i got that adderall i felt like i had a new lease on life. 

lol oh boy this really opened up a can of worms for me didn‚Äôt it! sorry i just had a bad time and it upsets me every time i think about it, i know some people have positive experiences!"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,I don‚Äôt know based on ops wording but if he did telehealth they can‚Äôt get prescribed stimulants through telehealth
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Yes I meant non stimulant
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,What stim works for you?
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,How does that make any sense when depression and anxiety are frequently the RESULT of untreated ADHD? That's the definition of treating the symptoms instead of the cause.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Honestly sounds like a good idea
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Same.  It's helped in the fact that I didn't realize how bad my depression is.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,What were the addrerall side effects?
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"This is unrelated to Wellbutrin, but I have TMJ. I‚Äôm currently taking Qelbree and I clench my teeth at night. I have the worst jaw and facial pain atm, and I‚Äôm trying to see whether I should try out the stimulants. Are you still grinding your teeth at night on the low adderall dose? I heard that all adhd meds make you clench/grind teeth, and I feel like I‚Äôm at a loss as to whether I should prioritize managing my ADHD or getting pain relief. :("
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Hey after a few months have gone by, how do you like the Wellbutrin Vyvanse combo?"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Agree with all that.
Wellbutrin can be a great addition to stimulant meds. I have both and the Wellbutrin helps to even out the dropoff when the stronger stuff is...damn. Can't think of the right word. Dissipating, on the down slope, leaving your body, that kind of thing."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm on. But I also have anxiety and depression which the Wellbutrin is supposed to help with.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I don‚Äôt really get any kind of feeling from concerta, but I feel like I still can‚Äôt focus most of the time or my good moments get wasted on things that are useless. Currently in the middle of a semester too. Wish there was something else. Supposed to talk to my doc soon and he said there is another that may work. It‚Äôs for head injuries too but I forgot the name so I can‚Äôt even google it. I have a head injury too üòÖ"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Which one did you get first and why was the other one added?  I would kind of like Wellbutrin to help get rid of vaping and increase my libido, but I‚Äôm a new diagnosis and would like to get a stimulant that works for me first.  I‚Äôm on Ritalin and it is not. It‚Äôs making me a zombie.  Unfortunately, my response from the doctor is that I have to wait two weeks to get the new rx for Adderall.  Not sure why.  Different drug and my insurance doesn‚Äôt cover anyway."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"It‚Äôs a common first step because it has fewer negative side effects, doesn‚Äôt cause dependence, and it‚Äôs easier to access for most people. It makes sense to try it first before moving on to other options."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Did you ever end up trying that combo?
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Welbutrin is actually a common treatment with bipolar patients because it‚Äôs not as likely to trigger mania as other antidepressants. 

A lot of doctors start with Welbutrin because it increases dopamine which can be effective in helping ease ADHD symptoms. It‚Äôs also common for depression to exacerbate ADHD symptoms and viceversa. 

I take Welbutrin and it helps me a lot."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Seriously, this. They tried SSRIs with me at first too, starting with prozac. I've never been manic in my life, no signs of bipolar or anything like that, but as soon as I started taking prozac I had a bad episode of mania. The first and only one I've ever had and it was not pretty."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Not sure why you‚Äôre getting downvoted... but I agree with you!  

yes Wellbutrin isn‚Äôt a first line treatment BUT even people who have been getting a stimulant prescription for years are having issues getting a consistent supply.  So I agree, if I were a practioner, I‚Äôd be reluctant to start someone on stimulants until the supply issue gets better.  Starting and stopping a med like that isn‚Äôt good and how is someone supposed to figure out their dose if they can‚Äôt even get it!

I actually just started Wellbutrin last month to have that ‚Äúin my system‚Äù for when my prescription isn‚Äôt ready on time.  Shortage sucks."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Coming at it in the other direction, Vyvanse first then tried SSRIs which all failed for depression I was so thankful someone mentioned wb on here and it was what I needed for depression and honestly made me function in ways I never thought possible and made me stop craving sugar completely.

Don't knock wb (to op), it's a miracle drug in it's own right, it may not be all they need but it's a good thing to try for auxillary things which most with ADHD are affected by."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I‚Äôm not judging you, I‚Äôve got alcohol issues myself, but technically we‚Äôre not supposed to have caffeine or other substances with our ADHD meds.  I just started Wellbutrin and I definitely notice I don‚Äôt tolerate alcohol much anymore and I‚Äôm drinking less because I don‚Äôt like the way it makes me feel and I wake up feeling awful.  I‚Äôm hoping it helps me quit entirely, and hope it can do the same for you. Try to keep taking it and let the immediate bad side effects try to train your brain that the substances aren‚Äôt enjoyable."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"For a lot of people it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúhalf assed‚Äù treatment, but pretty effective. It makes sense to start with the treatment that has the fewest side effects and is the most accessible, and then move on to other treatments if it doesn‚Äôt work, or often combine treatments."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"it isn‚Äôt just for depression, it can treat adhd too. it has also been used for people who want to quit smoking."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Did you change to a stimulant? If so what did you tell your psych?
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"i‚Äôm on the same combo currently. i‚Äôm annoyed because it took four appointments for my dr to take me seriously and diagnosis adhd. drs are so anti stimulant and it‚Äôs frustrating because i‚Äôve wasted so much time and money and still struggle. 

good luck with your new doctor :)"

Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,I agree üíØ
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Agreed! It‚Äôs a very spot on description.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,same.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I second this about coming off of it. I‚Äôve done that a couple times. I‚Äôve been on Wellbutrin for almost a decade on and off. And the mood swings and depression coming off of it is absolutely terrifying for me at least. 

I will say idk if it really does anything for me anymore. But maybe I‚Äôm just used to it because I‚Äôve been on it for so long. And idk what‚Äôs on the other side of being off of it for an extended period of time. I would taper off then go back because the side effects were worse than taking it everyday"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Crazy how it's different for so many people. I was at 300 mg for close to a year when I realized it wasn't doing anything for me. Quit completely cold turkey. Not a single side effect, couldn't have even told ya if I was taking it or not (definitely validated my feelings of it not working for me, lol).

Alternatively, my dad would probably kill himself if he didn't take his Wellbutrin."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I had horrible withdrawal effects coming off Wellbutrin. Was taking it for about a month and didn‚Äôt like how it made me feel, so my doctor took me off of it cold turkey. When I stopped taking it, my energy level plummeted so badly I could only stay awake for about 5 hours before I crashed and had to go back to sleep. My mood plummeted and I got seriously depressed. After a few weeks of that, the withdrawal effects went away and I felt normal again. My doctor seemed surprised that going off of it cold turkey had negative effects on me, but clearly I‚Äôm not the only person this has happened to. It scares me how little prescribers seem to know about these meds."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"This. The withdrawal from it is harsh. I‚Äôve tried a few times, very very slowly and it still makes me so tired and physically exhausted I cannot function or work, so I have to go back on it. It‚Äôs been something like 20 years now."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,My husband had to literally be my nurse and take care of me for days when I was coming off of it
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I use both methylphenidate XR at 56 mg and bupropion at 300 mg. It induces me to medical accommodations under the ADA at work due to hyperhydrosis and xerostomia (cottonmouth). These two in specific are notorious for it, altho almost all psych meds can have these as sides.  I wear shorts when it‚Äôs otherwise prohibited and keep a drink that provides sugars to keep my saliva stimulated when they otherwise only let you have water unless on your break. Water alone does nothing for the xerostomia.

I also feel that the norepinephrine increase does no favors for my intermittent explosion e rage or my dissociative PTSD.

I feel burned out by like 11 AM and I take my meds around 6-7 AM. I also use a low dose klonopin but it should not make me that tired. I think it‚Äôs overstimulated from too much of two very activating catecholamines.

My explosive rage is worse at night if I miss my rebound 18 mg concerta, so I don‚Äôt think this is negatively impacting my other conditions. However I think it‚Äôs the norepinephrine from the welbutrin that is worse for this type of mixed state (co-occur or in response to saddening stuff often).  I need to see about an alternate med. I started lithium for it but my level is not in the therapeutic range at the current dose so it might be slightly less."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I was confused for a second and had to Google, were you saying it's an SNRI?

I was thinking you meant SSRIs which totally failed me... But then I discovered what wb really is, and is what my doctor explained. Basically it is a dopamine focused drug.. From the web:

> How does Wellbutrin work? Wellbutrin is the brand name for bupropion, which is neither an SSRI nor an SNRI, but rather an NDRI. Bupropion (Wellbutrin, Wellbutrin SR, Wellbutrin XL, Aplenzin) is used to treat depression.

Just for clarification if anyone is curious.

SSRIs IMHO suck (erectile dysfunction as a side effect does not help with depression)and I'm not sure about SNRI but wb is the only depression meds that worked for me."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,I had 300mg of Venlafaxin. Cut down to 150mg years ago. Works good for me.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Glad I wasn't alone in the insane depression coming off it. It sucked for sure.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Hey, just wanted to mention that Bupropion is an NDRI."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"That's something the pharmacy has to include in handing the meds to you. You should never quit any antidepressant abruptly, always wean off of them."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Well I was on ADHD meds for the longest time then a drug screen showed I was on some illegal drugs that I was t for some reason it did so left that practice to s closer office she said I don't have ADHD and Gabe me buproipien like you did 150 for 6 weeks the. 300 said my meds was hiding other conditions
Depression apparently and anxiety some how I was useing it for and I did r have ADHD"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Is it like Sertraline that just really messes you up when you suddenly stop? 

&#x200B;

Though, getting off of Sertraline properly, even then sometimes the side effects aren't the best. I had taken it for 12 years and properly got off and was a mess of emotions. He had trapped me so much i felt insane for a little. It had also given me bad head jolts and slurring of speech and bad digestive system, etc."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,What stim med are u on if I may ask?
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,yes it is difficult to stop if you don‚Äôt have support around it could be very difficult
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Did you try to take anything to counteract the increased norepinephrine? Supplements such as Ltheanine or medications like Propranolol would have helped.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"For me, it helped with depression (including lack of motivation/initiation), which in turn has made it easier to address ADHD problems."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"For me it helps with both energy and focus, and I have fewer psychological barriers to initiation. 

It wasn‚Äôt a dramatic change for me, I just noticed one day that I hadn‚Äôt been struggling as much lately. And that continued to be the case even when my circumstances changed. 

That said, I still have ADHD. I need various strategies to get myself going, keep myself going, return to what I was doing, plan what I‚Äôm going to do, etc."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,This
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Yep. I was told its pretty much good for people who need a bit more pep or are very obese ( weight loss benefits ) but not great for anxiety or really improving adhd
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Yeah for me it‚Äôs like . It allowed me to put in an hour or two studying when it‚Äôs peak effective . But it‚Äôs only one or two hours of feeling on point. Then it‚Äôs just like I‚Äôm a slightly more organized version of myself , but still super distractible and can easily spend hours scrolling or typing

Like I can tell there are times 5 hours in . I have a coffe in hand , and yeah , I‚Äôm definitely alert . But I feel it‚Äôs very short lived and without the coffee idk"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Same for me too. more motivation to get things done (including boring things) subtle better mood most of the time, more energy (also subtle).  It‚Äôs kind of like it‚Äôs helping me around the periphery by making my life slightly but steadily more organized and pleasant, but not a huge wow I am so much more focused and productive.  And procrastination still there at times, but the increased motivation helps a lot. FWIW I should say that my start was rocky esp the first week. Reading accounts on the bupropion sub were encouraging for sticking with it, tho there are also many writing about side effects there."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Sorry to hear that. As a woman taking it, do you mind sharing when that happened and how you know it was the Wellbutrin?"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,I would love to hear the PMDD connect with Wellbutrin-
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Omg same experience with Welbutrin - terrible PMDD was breaking down and crying 6 days before my period, no motivation. But that showed up probably after 6 months of taking it. I added in a Chaste Berry supplement (Hum Nutrition‚Äôs Moody Bird) and that has helped a lot. May need to look into the Vyvanse next - love the Welbutrin for the mood / energy."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"It's so so weak with dopamine reuptake, hence it not working for many people who have ADHD. It primarily targets norepinephrine."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Are you still on the Wellbutrin? How‚Äôs it working for you? Still working for your BED/ADHD?
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,You‚Äôre generally correct but I think bupropion is an NDRI rather than an SNRI
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Thank you for pointing out that Wellbutrin isn‚Äôt an SNRI. 

Because SNRIs have the (N)orepinephrine, they should presumably do better for adhd than something that deals with (D)opamine predominantly‚Ä¶ though they are in the same axis so either should help a bit, depending on what the issue is. Dopamine would help ppl to get motivated to get started, where Norepinephrine allows for the focus on more boring/complex tasks. 

Low Dopamine looks like only being able to engage with addictive, very exciting activities like scrolling, shopping, gossiping whereas norepinephrine is more of that ‚Äúzone‚Äù feeling.

I‚Äôve been exploring if SNRIs wouldn‚Äôt be the best of both worlds. N affecting drugs on their own (amphetamines) could feel anxious, but the (S)erotinin of the SNRI would presumably smooth that out. 
Of course, the issue would have to be norepinephrine & not the many other root cause issues that provide adhd like symptoms"

Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"They all put me to sleep and gave me brain fog. It didn‚Äôt matter how little I took - even a small fraction of a tablet. 

Adderall also plunged me into deep depression each time I woke up, which was always precisely 4 hours after taking it."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Lol my doctor prescribed it for sleep and said the exact same thing! And I looooove it for sleep too it‚Äôs a godsend for me
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Trazodone is a god send. Best sleep ever.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Do you know if I will notice a difference once it fully takes effect? I‚Äôve been on Wellbutrin for about 5/6 weeks now and I got the little boost when I first started taking it but now I don‚Äôt like like it‚Äôs working as well as it did initially
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"When I take it I start feeling more alert within a couple of hours. It might take that long for the antidepressant effect to reach its full potential, but you'll know right away if it's working as a stimulant."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I absolutely agree! I hope it doesn‚Äôt come off like I‚Äôm pushing stimulants onto OP. Lol. I just know the way that doctors can be with prescribing stimulants to adults. I‚Äôve had issues getting my script myself because I‚Äôve kissed my monthly psych appointment, or insurance wouldn‚Äôt cover it, etc. I encourage everybody to do whatever works for them. Stimulant, non stimulant, ndri, no meds, whatever it is!"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I understand that. I meant that it‚Äôs not specifically an adhd medication. It‚Äôs typically used to treat depression, though it has been effective in treating some with adhd. It‚Äôs an NDRI, which is a type of antidepressant."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"In my personal experience, I tried Wellbutrin and Strattera, both for a few months. Wellbutrin did nothing for me and Strattera made me so nauseous, I barely ate for the entirety of me being on it. It didn‚Äôt improve my adhd symptoms either. When I told my doctor about these symptoms, she accused me of drug seeking and stated that I actually have a mood disorder. I left that doctor and went somewhere else, and was (very fortunately) put on adderall. It‚Äôs been almost a year of being on stimulants and I have no complaints, and have noticed an extreme improvement in my life. The ‚Äúhoops‚Äù a lot of us have to jump through is dealing with uneducated doctors who don‚Äôt believe us and accuse us of drug seeking. Hopefully you don‚Äôt have to go through that."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Same here, I think my GP was just hesitant to prescribe stimulants. He just prescribed Wellbutrin and referred me to a psych, who then prescribed more effective meds instead"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,[deleted]
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,And they probably got incentivized by the drug manufacturer.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,It is still off label. They approved viloxazine this year and it it is the first non-stimulant to be licensed for adults in 20 years (since atomoxetine).  Also that seems to be the only place that is showing bupropion as approved for ADHD
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I get mine through Circle Medical. All of my medication has been via telehealth with them, and I‚Äôm on Adderall.

They have handled the evaluation, they participate in my insurance. Multiple doctors available, lots of flexibility. They have been great."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I‚Äôve only ever met with my doc via telehealth and been prescribed Adderall XR. I even get it delivered to my door w/o having to go to a pharmacy. 
From what I‚Äôve heard from my other friends with ADHD, some docs, regardless of how you do your appointment, seem to prefer to start with non-stimulant options."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"In California, you definitely can get prescribed stimulants via telehealth. I was just prescribed adderall after being assessed and determined to have combination of inattentive & hyperactive symptoms"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Adderall worked really well for me. Vyvanse worsened my anxiety to the extreme. I‚Äôm currently on Strattera rn tho but have only been for a month so unsure how well it‚Äôs working.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I know, It's counterintuitive.  I'll try to find the information in print, but I've spoken with a member of the Editorial Board of The ADHD Report (Barkley led ADHD Journal) and they confirmed.  It has to do with determining whether someone's depression/anxiety is a result of ADHD or a separate diagnosis.  Stimulant meds can mask depression/anxiety symptoms in early treatment so treating adhd second helps determine."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I grind my teeth a little when I'm not on meds, and my impression is that I do appx. the same amount on Adderall.  It was much worse on Wellbutrin - I'd have nightmares that my teeth were broken and wake up with a sore jaw.

Granted, that was year 1 of Covid, so things were stressful"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I have epilepsy so I actually had to go off the Vyvanse last month because it triggered seizures. Before I went off it though, I found it had diminishing returns. The first week went well, I felt more focused and less restless but the positive effects kind of dwindled after a few weeks. Aside from the seizures, I don't think it was the right med for me."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Yeah, the druggy term is come down right? But it feels weird using that for a prescription haha"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Wearing off is what you‚Äôre looking for. üòä
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Yeah!  I feel that.  They started me in strattera and it worked wonders for those.  Didn't help at all with my drive, motivation, or focus."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Heads up, Anxiety is a possible side effect of the Wellbutrin. The dr that prescribed it didn't realize it so when my anxiety went through the roof they then gave me Paxil to help."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Another made a comment on how Wellbutrin helps with motivation and routine and that has üíØbeen my experience. Good luck!!
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I had Wellbutrin added first to help with the symptoms of my SSRI. Mostly low libido issues. Zoloft made me a zombie and I didn‚Äôt like that. I‚Äôm thankfully not a zombie on my ADHD meds but it could be because of how it reacts with other meds I take? I know when I was 18 or so I tried Wellbutrin by itself and that made me sick, but with an SSRI it works well. I‚Äôm lucky I have good insurance."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Yeah that‚Äôs definitely true . But even if it‚Äôs just a mildly stimulating emotional event , like a lively discussion , my BP could shoot up to 170. 

I normally have 110-120 resting BP . 

It‚Äôs kinda hard to justify potentially dying , or feeling like I might , for only a small increase in function . 

I really think it‚Äôs the 24 hr formulation , as in I think for whatever reason it‚Äôs compounding . Because it didn‚Äôt get that bad until week 3.

But yeah I should see if eliminating caffeine 100% could help. It would just be weird because I‚Äôd have Wellbutrin and coffee early in the day, and then 6-7 hours later is when my chest would hurt"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I dont disagree necessarily, but trying wellbutrin as a first option seems really dumb for alot of reasons. Firstly you cant treat adhd with wellbutrin in my country atleast and if you are then it needs to be prescribed to counter anxiety and depression. Second the research and knowledge of treating adhd with ritalin is far greater then wellbutrin. 

Generally it is very individual and i understand that wellbutrin works for alot of people, i just dont understand why that is the first they give you when there are medicine that treat adhd specificaly. 

And if anyone is curious as to why they dont use wellbutrin for adhd in my country (norway), it is because the lack of research compared to say ritalin."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Honestly this psych only saw me 15 mins. Directly prescribed wellbutrin, said try this for a month if it help you have ADHD, did not see the need for a test. She did say if you want I can test you but at the time I said whatever you recommend (I did choose her because her area included adult adhd). To top it off there was a country wide shortage of wellbutrin at the time, which I found out when I went to the pharmacy. Overall I didn't feel l would get a lot of help from her. Soooo I cancelled my appointment and decided to find another psych. That was 2 months ago and I did not take any action..."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Just told her my whole journey so far. I went prepared with a list of all the symptoms that I could relate to or applied to me.

I had that one test done on me by my counselor and also by my former family doctor. But neither wanted to prescribe stimulants. My counselor because she‚Äôs telehealth and I‚Äôm outside her practicing GP area. My family doctor because she wasn‚Äôt confident about the mental health side of things. She sent me for a referral to a psych for an actual diagnosis and wouldn‚Äôt even try me on Vyvanse for a month. My referral was for 13 months in the future, so I was super disheartened.

But my new doctor today said she had a different method to dealing with adult ADHD diagnosis. She saw I had done the test twice and asked me for the results for my chart. Then I had the prescription in hand in less than an hour. Super excited for what tomorrow can bring!"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Adderall. It works great for me for the most part.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,I think Wellbutrin also assists binge eating and smoking so that could be why you aren't experiencing cravings as much and are satisfied more (I'm assuming).

Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Do you take both?
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,So you take both vyvanse and wb?
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"The mood swings from Bupropion can get pretty nuts (at least they did for me), when I was at a high dose.  My mood would literally swing like a pendulum from ecstatic, to about ready to punch someone, or something.  And that pendulum would swing with the snap of a finger.

Before my dose was lowered, I had thought I was literally going crazy because I was talking, or even screaming at myself for the smallest possible hiccups in my day.  A lot of self hatred and ""fuck you \*insert my real name\*"" that sort of stuff-- for the tiniest little mistake.

Now that I am on a stable dose for my physiology and brain chemistry though, I believe it truly helps me not to have to take as much stim medication, *and that is always a good thing.*"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,I‚Äôm at 300mg right now and I don‚Äôt feel anything but if I forget I know usually within 3 hrs when I feel incredibly dizzy and nauseous and just overall blah. It really is cool but annoying how everyone has different experiences on one medication.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Literally me. It's so bizarre... the easiest thing to come off and in the end it hardly does much at all. I've been on it for 8 years now.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Years ago I travelled and had forgotten my Wellbutrin, you would have thought I was withdrawing from heroin, it was that bad."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,how many weeks?
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"It is incredibly brutal. Like I said, don‚Äôt be an idiot like me and think you can just maintain. Because things got really dark really quick."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Could be the adderal it makes my son and I aggressive. It is completely out of character for him so we stopped it asap
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Dexedrine. 

Adderall gives me nasty side effects like it does for others. Never realized it until I was actually switched. I‚Äôll never go back to any other stim med."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"To clarify, initiation is both a depression and an ADHD symptom? I would describe depression initiation issues as more lack of interest, as opposed to ADHD paralysis, where I want to do the thing but feel like I can‚Äôt."

Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Exactly! Which is better than nothing and why I still say it's been good to me. I'll take a slightly more organized version.

That being said I'm supposed to be working right now..."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Visiting the bupropion sub is a great idea for anyone who is starting out!
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,It was maybe a year into taking it and I only discovered the issue when my psychiatrist suggested I get off of it and try something else.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I had severe PMDD symptoms and my psychiatrist suggested weaning off of Wellbutrin and they disappeared. Idk why WHY but I have seen things online that indicate that bupropion can have adverse effects for anxiety. 

When my cycle would come around, leading up to it I would be crying uncontrollably and spiralling out. The worst day would be the day before my period started. The day it started, back to normal. Then it would be fine for 2-3 weeks and start up again. Just wild mood swings, out of control emotions, etc. 

After I got off the meds, it stopped. I transitioned to Vyvanse and another antidepressant."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Still helping though not quite as much as it was initially.

Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"For me, Effexor was an unmitigated disaster. It put me into a brain fog that began the process of ruining my life. Nobody believed me that it was from the Effexor, and I was too out of it to effectively advocate for myself or find a different doctor. It took over 2 years before I was able to get off it. 

Wellbutrin, on the other hand, has been very helpful."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Omg same here! I got crazy brain fog and couldn't even speak to people. Validating
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Huh. It's really interesting how drugs affect different people in different ways.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,[deleted]
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Why sleep after taking your adderall? Were you not taking it in the morning?
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I notice the effect about a month or two in but it‚Äôs very subtle, not like stimulants, for me. I generally just feel like I have more energy and motivation to get things done, and feeling overall a bit more positive. 

I like that it‚Äôs not a major difference and much less intense than stimulants but it may not feel that way for everyone."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Same thing happened to me - prescribed effexor which is even less relevant than Strattera. When I refused, because ssri make me sick (serotonin syndrome, my serotonin system is just fine) and they accuse me of having a mood disorder as well. After one session. my GP had sent me there to deal with what he diagnosed as adhd with comorbid depression (as many on this post can probably relate to - self esteem drops throughout your life to the point of severe depression because of undiagnosed adhd and the difficulties we experience integrating in society as a result) 

Psychiatrist literally told me to find a drug dealer if I wanted stimulants because there was no way he was risking it so close to retirement. I don't think it signifies a mood disorder to refuse treatment you aren't comfortable with for valid reasons, but it does show just how far up their ass some of these ""doctors"" are..."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"If you‚Äôre able to deal with actual doctors, you are steps above where many people are."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Mine was too, I‚Äôm sensitive to caffeine now so we were afraid stimulants could cause some of the same effects. Didn‚Äôt try Wellbutrin but another non stimulant."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"You know I‚Äôve heard that‚Äôs the case, I‚Äôve been told by a lot of people that it‚Äôs a process. But the truth is when it
starts to get better by even a little, it puts things into perspective, and it give you a bit of hope. I use to be a really irritable and reactive man, I would lose my mind at the slightest annoyance. With the meds I‚Äôm way better on that front, truly most anything it‚Äôs like water off a ducks back. I‚Äôm still a little foggy, but I talk to my doc every month and we talk about a plan, what‚Äôs been going on, my environmental stresses and what the best step is. There‚Äôs hope, Wellbutrin may not work for you, but it get better"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"This doesn‚Äôt matter since you had to stop taking it anyway, but 2 weeks probably wouldn‚Äôt have been long enough for it to make a difference for ADHD. It took me longer than that to notice real effects when I went on it and each time I increased the dose."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Please explain the mechanism by which they get incentivized by the drug manufacturer if you are going to claim it‚Äôs probably true. Is it briefcases full of cash? Swiss bank accounts?
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"This definitely does happen.  I don't know why someone would downvote you on this.

However, this happens far less frequently as of the last several years. --and this is really due to the litany of Opioid lawsuits spreading out to Drs all over western countries.  This has affected the way Drs prescribe and push all medications across the board.

This also used to occur far more frequently with GPs and Physicians, rather than Psychs."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Doubtful, no one forced me and I made it abundantly clear if I don‚Äôt feel right I‚Äôll stop the meds. I told them that I had a class a cdl and was leery about going on any stimulants because it could possibly jeopardize my career. They have been nothing but supportive and told me if I decided to not use meds that they could get me into therapy for just that if I wanted."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,When?  They allowed stimulants through telehealth because of Covid but that ended like 10/15 or so
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Seconding. California, August this year."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,After looking more into it. What I am talking about is exclusive to where I‚Äôm from(New York)
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,You can in Illinois as well. I have never seen my psychiatrist in person.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I see, thank you! I‚Äôm glad the low dose adderall is working out for you. Sorry to hear that you still grind though. I‚Äôm just going to have to figure out something out with my psych NP next visit"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Well, I‚Äôm really sorry to hear that. I hope everything gets better and you find what works for you. Thanks for the advice. I started well Buterin about three weeks ago and haven‚Äôt felt the desired effect. Just looking into maybe an additional stimulant to help. Thanks for the advice."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,I felt really good for a few days on the strattera and now nothing. I‚Äôm assuming I need a higher dose.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Thanks
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Yeah it‚Äôs really a shame that almost all meds that are effective for ADHD raise heartrate/blood pressure.   Guanfacine doesn‚Äôt, it actually helps blood pressure so you could ask your doc about that one.

 I had to quit caffeine 100% even before I started Wellbutrin. When I started taking Adderall I just could not tolerate even a half cup first thing in the morning. I was having random heart palpitations and insomnia sometimes, so that‚Äôs how long lasting caffeine was. All that solved when I eliminated caffeine instead of moderating it."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,If you have two medications that work and one is easier to get and has fewer side effects it makes sense to try that one first even if the other works for more people.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Can confirm: Wellbutrin XR assists with binge-eating and smoking. The drawback is the anhedonia
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"yeah, that and depression can cause cravings I assumed and maybe first time I've been this normal (depression wise)."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"yeah, when I wake up. 50mg V, 150mg WB."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"yeah, 50mg V, 150mg WB."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Yeah I tried Wellbutrin and it made me an irrational douche bag. The worst part was I knew I was being irrational, I knew I was being awful, but I was just pissed all the time and couldn‚Äôt do anything to make it stop.

My doctor is a doll and was humoring me by trying Wellbutrin in the first place. It was worth the try and it does work for some people but for others like me, absolutely not."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,[deleted]
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Sounds like you had a manic reaction. That can happen.
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I don‚Äôt remember exactly, but I think it was maybe 10 days to 2 weeks. Could have been longer. It was probably at least 6 years ago. I didn‚Äôt realize at the time that my symptoms were due to me coming off that drug. Those symptoms were totally unlike the withdrawal symptoms I‚Äôve experienced with other antidepressants. I think maybe I am just more sensitive to some medications than most people."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I believe it is possible. I may inquire into a non stimulating one namely guanfacine / Intuniv. It‚Äôs an alpha receptor antagonist that has been researched extensively for cognitive impairment I think due to frontotempiral dementia. It works for ADHD as well. It‚Äôs like a third line med. I tried strattera but actually experienced delerium with loss of orientation to time and a severe worsening of my PTSD on strattera / Zoloft. I thought it was the Zoloft but in retrospect it could have been the increase of norepinephrine due to the strattera. They say it‚Äôs non stimulant but norepinephrine is a stimulant like dopamine. It‚Äôs what they give to people who would otherwise be dead bc it‚Äôs so stimulating it keeps your heart pumping. When my mom was in the ICU dying from pancreatic cancer the life sustaining medicines were literally pure dopamine and norepinephrine, that‚Äôs how potent stimulants they are. 

Then the idiot doctors ask me why my heart rate is increased, ‚Äúlol I‚Äôm on welbutrin and Ritalin u f$&k!‚Äù

I‚Äôm personally tired of the cold hands dry mouth and excessive sweating lol."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Ok I‚Äôve heard good things about that before. I‚Äôll have to ask my doc about that. Is it short lasting or extended release?
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,i cannot differentiate between these
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Exactly !! Lol. And I feel it gives you that extra moment of execution function to ponder what exactly you are doing with your time .

Like that ‚Äúhey I‚Äôm supposed to be working right now‚Äù

It‚Äôs just that little extra wherewithal to make a conscious decision of your actions . 


It‚Äôs small, but significant ."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,Thanks. Obviously that‚Äôs not what anyone wants. Hope you‚Äôre doing better!
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,So your PMDD sx disappeared upon discontinuance of Wellbutrin? Did they first present upon initiation of the medication?  Thanks for the info!
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Iirc it has a weaker effect on dopamine reuptake inhibition vs norepinephrine so it‚Äôs primary effect is on the latter. But there‚Äôs a lil dopamine benefit too

Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Oh hey, another person who had a horrible Effexor experience! Thankfully I wasn‚Äôt on it for as long as you (only a month in my case) but that‚Äôs a month of my life I‚Äôll never get back.

Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"I tried multiple dosages to see if taking larger or smaller amounts would help.

Edit: the depression it plunged me into like clockwork was enough for me to know it was the wrong med for me, but I still tried different dosages. I will never take Adderall again due to the depression side effect but I did try other stimulants after that. All had the effects I described in my other comment."
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,This is me too! Low dose and I‚Äôm snoozin very peacefully though I might add but high dose does wonders for my adhd.

Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Hello,
I too am dealing with this. Same exact scenerio, I've told its probably anxiety and depression twice now by doctors who won't give me ADHD meds. I've been diagnosed as a teenager by 3 different doctors for ADHD, yet when I come back as an adult when my life is falling apart, they make it seem like I'm drug seeking. I just know what works for me, and recently my new doc put me on Wellbutrin, which is weird because I sent them my diagnosis with ADHD and they still did this. I have worse ADHD than anybody Ive ever met , to the point where is estimate more than 50 people in my life have pointed it out without me even telling them, to the point where I sometimes got bullied for it. I haven't met a more disorganized person. 

What is something I could say to make the doctor understand? Should I get a new one?"
Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,I‚Äôm not very sensitive to caffeine but stimulants have affected my sleep enough that I‚Äôll be talking to my psych about switching up my meds soon

Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"Kick-backs. They get a monetary ""award"" for prescribing specific meds. Almost like a ""rebate"", if you will. This benefits the manufacturer. It gives the manufacturers a larger customer base, with the added potential for those new customers to be life-long consumers and remain ""brand loyal"". So some prescribers will push a certain medicine that *might* work and will try to avoid prescribing something else that is less lucrative for them. As someone else mentioned, this has become more regulated - to the benefit of the consumer, but there will always be shady and greedy people in the world, unfortunately."

Had my first appointment and doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin for ADHD,"There are multiple formulations but they will most likely attempt the spansule form first which is the XR version of Dexedrine. 

I‚Äôd been on methylphenidate of all formulations, Adderall multiple formulations- and until i found Dexedrine there was nothing that worked as well for me.

I believe it goes by Dextrostat for the tablets and Dexedrine-Spansule for the XR. Good luck‚Ä¶ it took a bit of talking to my Doctor and explaining things before they were willing to try it. 

They will most likely try Vyvanse first because that is the same Dextroamphetamine drug, only made in lisdexampfetamine, which is a pro-drug that requires your liver to break it down first before the amphetamine is released into the bloodstream. 

Dexedrine however has an f‚Äôing generic (it‚Äôs been a generic since far before Adderall even had one) So it won‚Äôt cost you literally 700 dollars a month if you don‚Äôt have the right insurance."

I graduated before I was diagnosed, by about 8 years? Funny thing is, you can be intelligent AND have adhd, you can graduate top of your school in uni and still have struggled through it. I did and if it wasn't for some stroke of luck that let me hyper focus on my uni course in 3rd and 4th year then I'd have likely failed. We don't have non adhd twins, so we can never know how well we could have performed if we didn't have adhd. So if you can graduate with it, you've developed some great coping skills, strategies and masking I'd say. So, well done you!

So when I see a post like this its confusing to me because my testing / diagnosis was a very sort of thorough ""diagnostic,"" where I had to perform multiple timed tasks, and do several sort of memory / reflex exercises.

My ADHD journey is over,"That doctor is seriously misinformed. You probably DID have ADHD when you were younger, but ADHD disappears on your eighteenth birthday! How did your doc not know that??

Sorry you got such an ignorant professional."
My ADHD journey is over,"WTF is with these doctors I read about?

When I was 58 YO, after having graduated college and having a successful 36-year (at that point) career, including a senior vice president level job, I was diagnosed as having ADHD. No one, not my primary care provider, not the therapist she referred me to, not the psychiatrist she referred me to, ever said ""Oh, no: you can't have ADHD. You graduated from a major university. You've had a successful career. You can't *possibly* have ADHD.""

When I started rattling off symptoms, they all agreed that I have ADHD. Plus, anxiety and depression but I knew that.

Because of my age, a history of high-end-of-normal blood pressure, and recently-diagnosed high blood pressure, stimulants were not an option for me and I was prescribed atomoxetine. Not only did it not work, but it gave me awful headaches. The psych prescribed bupropion and after about six months of playing with dosages we settled on 450 mg. I still have some ADHD symptoms, but they are less severe than they were and the anxiety and depression are pretty much gone. The symptoms are easily manageable most days.

My ADHD was not diagnosed sooner (like about 45 years prior) because when I was in elementary school no one knew about ADHD. I was a smart, quiet kid who got good grades, so no one was overly concerned. Besides, there were no treatments back then. I just thought my symptoms were quirks and worked around them. Eventually, my career led me to a place where I didn't have to produce ""work"" and I was an overseer, subject matter expert, problem-solver, wisdom-giver. The symptoms didn't have a chance to manifest themselves at work and I was so exhausted from making sure they didn't manifest themselves that I didn't realize how they were affecting my personal life. It wasn't until I took a job where I had to get stuff done and pay attention that I realized something was wrong. And here I am.

It pisses me off when I hear doctors saying crap like this. We are in 2024, not 1997.

PS: Please don't interpret my story as a veiled attempt to say OP or anyone else reading this is lesser because they struggle. I'm happy that people are realizing early that they have ADHD and are seeking treatment. I'm even happier that they aren't masking. If I knew way back then what I know now, you better believe I'd have sought treatment."
My ADHD journey is over,"Wow, congrats, now it is clear.

Well yes of course, if you take a medication that is not approved for the condition you are being evaluated for and it doesn't work, then you don't have that condition that it was never meant to treat in the first place. The most impenetrable logic.

My ADHD journey is over,"Having to go off of it for a couple of short periods recently (few days each time), I will say that in retrospect, it did help me to a small extent. However, when compared to the cumulative effect with both it and methylphenidate, it‚Äôs significantly less effect when only taking the Wellbutrin. I‚Äôve been on Wellbutrin for years now as an antidepressant, which doesn‚Äôt work as well as other antidepressants, but does so with less numbing of emotions than meds like Prozac. I guess the best way to describe Wellbutrin, at least for me, is that does an okay job for both, but there are better medications for both conditions that come with a worse side effects."

My ADHD journey is over,"this has been my experience with doctors as well and it‚Äôs made my life exponentially worse as i‚Äôve gotten older

i mostly blame the jackasses who lie to score adderall prescriptions, but these ignorant ass doctors who immediately write off ADHD because you did alright in school growing up (not good, not great, just alright enough to graduate) amongst other stupid reasons like the wellbutrin one (didn‚Äôt work for me either btw)

i‚Äôm one of those people with ADHD who has no idea how they feel about anything at any given moment, in a constant disassociative state, and can‚Äôt remember relevant examples to back up claims to save their life

people like us are just fucked because we aren‚Äôt dropouts or unemployed despite immense daily struggles with basic functioning

it‚Äôs like the diagnostic process was designed to exclude the more extreme presentations of the disorder. my executive functioning is terrible enough to where i can‚Äôt get myself to research doctors and schedule appointments without outside help, i can‚Äôt remember symptoms and other important info on the spot, nor can i ever get myself to jot down feelings, experiences, etc. to bring to appointments in order to mitigate that

so every doctor i‚Äôve seen just writes me off as one of those dickheads looking for adderall and sends me out the door telling me i‚Äôm just anxious and depressed and it‚Äôs not caused by anything else like ADHD or autism, sending me back to square one and back to my terrible, dysfunctional life

I'm really dreading just ... ""raw dogging"" as they say. My partner gave up a few months ago, when we both had this horrific death-flu, & I'm kicking myself that I didn't join him, especially since I always say I need a really bad sickness to stop me from smoking for like that first week or so.

My brain and doctors disagreed and thus begun a longish, uphill battle with the insurance company and more tests than I thought had even been developed (I was getting suspicious they tested me for shit totally unrelated to ADHD) - -  in any case, I guess they began to get tired of dealing with a persistent pain like me and extended the coverage until my second miraculous healing should occur.

My ADHD journey is over,"That's ... interesting. I've heard similar things about Champix, which I can't take, as mentioned; friends & family have told me they had wild nightmares on that drug, too. I've been smoking much more lately as a way to avoid doing / taking breaks from my final few uni assignments for the semester (& forever!), which is not cool. Personally, I'm worried about the physical cravings, & my overall need to fiddle or do stuff with my hands, or have pencils in my mouth or whatever. Collecting stuff to brace for that aspect, including lots of nuts to peel, & random little toys, a Rubix cube, & other stuff I can do while watching shows or whatever. Anyway, the point is I'm actually starting to hate the taste these days, & the whole bothersome routine of it (especially since I roll tobacco) -- but it's still my go-to for stress or, yeah, time out. 

It sounds like a pretty weird combo of not being satisfied by them, but at the same time going through withdrawals. But so good that this worked for your mate! I'm definitely going to ask my doctor about it soon. Cheers for the insight!"

Switching from Wellbutrin to Adderall. Words of Advice,Vyvanse !
Switching from Wellbutrin to Adderall. Words of Advice,If Wellbutrin causes it Adderall probably will too. You're probably going to need to take a beta blocker like propranolol with the adderall.
Switching from Wellbutrin to Adderall. Words of Advice,"While it's possible that you might have a better reaction to Strattera, since they both work on increasing the norepinephrine level, it probably would have the same effect on you.

Switching from Wellbutrin to Adderall. Words of Advice,"I tried taking Strattera along with my Vyvanse. It was horrible.

Switching from Wellbutrin to Adderall. Words of Advice,"weirdly enough I was on wellbutrin as a 20 year old with severe depression and undiagnosed ADHD and it work wonderful then.

Switching from Wellbutrin to Adderall. Words of Advice,"I took Wellbutrin for a year when I was first diagnosed. It helped my ADHD somewhat but made me grind my teeth at night. I then went off it for a few months and switched to Adderall, which manages my symptoms better without teeth grinding.  There was one brand of generic Wellbutrin that worked well but some of the other ones made me feel a lot of despair, which is not normal for me.

Switching from Wellbutrin to Adderall. Words of Advice,"Straterra did this to me too and also made me nauseous. If I didn‚Äôt eat a FULL breakfast within 45 mins of taking it, I got terrible stomach pains. Switched to adderall xr which was great during the workday but wore off quickly at 5pm and my brain felt like it was completely out of steam, and Id go into a functional freeze for the night. Taking a 4 hr instant adderall didn‚Äôt help enough to offset the adderall brain pain. 
Switched to vyvanse, found the right dose and haven‚Äôt looked back."
Switching from Wellbutrin to Adderall. Words of Advice,"I‚Äôm on the same combo and it took me years to get to this combination of these three for my anxiety, depression and ADHD and it works perfectly for me. By themselves they are barely affective in treating what they were originally prescribed to me for but together they have worked wonders for me with no issues."
Switching from Wellbutrin to Adderall. Words of Advice,Yes it works very well but it is causing blood pressure issues and ED so I am in the process of getting off of it.
Switching from Wellbutrin to Adderall. Words of Advice,"I made the stitch to Ritalin and then to adderall over 15 years ago.  I really don‚Äôt remember the doses of Wellbutrin and  Ritalin.  With adderall and vyvance I started at 10mg and worked my way up to 40mg.  Now I‚Äôm at 20mg of adderall and 10mg of vyvance.  Now Instead of increasing doses, I take a break for a day and resume the following day.  The reason I stopped taking the higher doses is due to stimulant induced side effects such as insomnia, high blood pressure, and ED.

Regarding effectiveness, basically I can tell when my focus is starting to fail.  I‚Äôm Less attentive on my job and easily distracted by anything that is more interesting than the task at hand.  When the dose is right, I can easily redirect my attention to the task I am supposed to be working on."
Switching from Wellbutrin to Adderall. Words of Advice,"Thanks for replying.
Allow me to ask does it lower your blood pressure? & What's your blood type?"
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I've been taking wellbutrin for several years. It has helped a lot with energy/motivation/focus and emotional control which then helps reduce anxiety. 

When I first started taking it (with breakfast) I began having a ""witching hour"" where I would wake up in the middle of the night and struggle to fall back asleep. That lasted maybe 2 months max.

The only other ill effect I've noticed is dry mouth. I'm not convinced it's gone away, I think I'm just used to it. Stay hydrated!

Try not to worry too much about what the potential side effects are before you start taking it. It's hard, but sometimes worrying about a bad reaction can cause that very thing."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I've been on it for about a month now.  I like it.  I do find it helps.  I feel like the ""TV static"" in my head that I didn't even really realize was there, is turned way down.  And my sleep cycle is better than it ever has been in my life, and I'm able to just... Get up to my alarm!  Like a normal human being."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I was prescribed Wellbutrin as an anti-depressant (before ADHD diagnosis). The effect of psych meds varies so widely from person to person - for one person a med may be a nightmare, while for another it‚Äôs life-saving. 

I think you definitely need to talk to your doctor more about concerns - like, you shouldn‚Äôt have gotten a prescription at all if this is a med you don‚Äôt want to take. 

Anyway I‚Äôve been on Wellbutrin for years. I‚Äôm someone who gets allllll the side effects when I first start a med, so I‚Äôm sure I didn‚Äôt love it the first couple of weeks, but those effects generally fade and I think it‚Äôs helpful. I take 300mg. 

You won‚Äôt feel anything at first. This is a med that takes weeks to build up in your system to see a change. This is not a stimulant like adderall or vyvanse. 

This is also not an ‚Äúaddictive‚Äù med. you may experience discontinuation effects if you end up going off it, but that is very different than an addiction. 

Good luck - I hope it helps you!"
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,[deleted]
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I was on Wellbutrin for over a year and a half, I am not sure if this was just my experience, but ended up quitting cold turkey with no side effects. (As a disclaimer, do NOT do anything against medical advice!!). It helped me get out of my depressive episode. I also have ADHD, and to me Wellbutrin is a ‚Äúlight‚Äù adderall. I never had any bad side effects, it gave me a lot of energy, and I lost 15-20lbs."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"First two weeks were hell for me, had my first ever panic attack and was almost too anxious to function, like skin-crawlingly bad (was also on Adderall). I‚Äôd feel the effects of Adderall but I would be too anxious to focus on anything but my own anxiety if that makes sense. Also mood swings and impulsive emotional reactions galore. That being said, 100 mg Wellbutrin is a pretty low dose, and I think I‚Äôm an outlier in how bad my experience was.

3 months later the anxiety is still there but it‚Äôs gotten much better and I‚Äôve learned ways to manage it. I also got on it after being in a hellish depression for 4 months, failing classes, and after the end of a 3 year relationship so that might have a little to do with mental state being awful as a baseline, so take my experience with an extra grain of salt as you should with anyones antidepressant stories. In my case it was definitely a mixture of the meds and life beating my ass that made it so bad.

Started taking it at 9 PM instead of with my Adderall at 8:30 AM and it‚Äôs been a life changer for the anxiety, I also lowered my Adderall dose from 15 mg to 10 mg with an IR 5 mg booster as needed. My head feels truly quiet nowadays which is a little unnerving sometimes but I guess this is what normal feels like and I‚Äôm just unaccustomed to it. 

All that being said (not trying to scare you), I would say it was definitely worth it for me but if you are already an anxious person (I would say that I wasn‚Äôt before starting it, or at least managed it well) it might be a bit rough at first. It definitely helped me more with my depression than my ADHD, but sometimes I would take it in the morning without my Adderall and I would get a small but noticeable boost in my ability to focus and just do tasks, comparable to like 5 mg Adderall for me. Sorry for rambling."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"ive was on it for a while, it helped with energy a bit, but overall didn't really do too much, or give me any side effects. dont worry too much about negative effects, if you start getting any, call your doctor and tell them about it, and remember you can always bring up your concerns about medications to them, it helps to write down things before going into an appointment, i know my brain becomes completely empty once im asked a question about anything medical"

Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I was nervous to go back on stimulants after over a decade so my doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin.

Like, to the point my kids and spouse have all commented that I seem happier/less stressed. I didn't really understand how adhd and anxiety can go hand-in-hand until I started Wellbutrin (I always understood they had a high comorbidity, but now I can see the connection)."

XL felt better to me than SR and the first few days of starting/restarting it give my anxiety, after that it's great and one of my ""found the one for me"" meds. Helps me just generally feel better and more awake inside without much in the way of side effects. 

I guess my rec would be to give it a chance and don't assume any initial anxiety will be permanent."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I've been on Wellbutrin for a few months now.  The 2nd month we bumped my dose up.  For about a week I felt manic just so overly happy, and then everything settled down and it's been gravy ever since.

Addiction is hilarious to me.  Like all other ADD drugs I've ever taken, somehow adhd people are always able to forget it despite society screaming everyone gets addicted and we'll become drug seekers.  Follow your dosing and you'll be fine.  It's a long term med so don't expect effects to affect your symptoms for a couple weeks at least.  For me it was about week 3 that I noticed the improvement after starting."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"Hello! 23 y/o w/ADHD Combined-Type and Generalized Anxiety Disorder here on 150 mg Wellbutrin. 

I can tell you that personally, Wellbutrin seems to make a positive difference when it comes to task initiation and increasing the number of spoons I have a day. It also seems to have helped the inattentive portion a bit, and having recently been off of it for 1 month, can honestly say I'd rather be on than off it right now. 

An honest list of the side-effects for me include: a bit of increased anxiety/easily triggered anxiety attacks at the start, increased sex drive, loss of appetite, hand tremors, and worsened constipation. The anxiety part is the most annoying because it is very physiological - I will simply get a rush of adrenaline to my system like 6-8 hours after I take it in the AM and it isn't pleasant while it lasts. On 150mg, I have found that these side-effects decrease substantially to the point where the anxiety attacks don't happen. I wasn't able to tolerate 300mg but that's ok. 

Going on Strattera was so much worse for me. I had nausea every time I took it."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"Wellbutrin CHANGED my life. Yet more so for severe anxiety and depression. I was no prescribed it for ADHD. Plus cannot really say it‚Äôs ‚Äúhelped‚Äù for ADHD hence why I got other adhd meds. That being said it‚Äôs an AMAZING med and I highly recommend anyway :)

I‚Äôm on 300mg xl and have so for years.  I now also take Vyvanse.  No issues. No side effects."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I was on it for five years and the only bad things I experienced was a little bit of insomnia for the first two weeks and it made my tummy hurt if I took it on an empty stomach. 100 mg is a pretty low dose. You may experience mild shakiness, some brain fog, upset stomach, and the occasional brain zap when you first start."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,been on it for ~8 years - typically SSRIs had AWFUL side effects for me so i‚Äôm on a combo of lamictal and wellbutrin. i‚Äôve honestly had minimal side effects especially with the wellbutrin
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"Just want to mention one possible effect of Wellbutrin I don‚Äôt hear folks talking about much: bruxism. Tell your dentist when you start this medication. 

I haven‚Äôt noticed anything personally, but- I already clench my teeth hard enough to cause stress fractures. When I told my dentist I‚Äôd started WB, she got pretty firm about how it was time to finally get the bite guard she‚Äôd been recommending. Keep an eye on it."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"Before I was ever diagnosed ADHD and on medication for ADHD, I was prescribed Wellbutrin for depression and anxiety.   There were no major issues with it,but I do recall changing to something else because I was more irritable while on Wellbutrin.   I do think if my ADHD had been diagnosed and managed the Wellbutrin probably would have been fine."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"just remember that most people come on reddit the vent about their negative experiences rather than to share their positives! you see more of the bad because it‚Äôs more common to vent off a bad experience than to have a good one and choose to come to reddit to celebrate.

give it a shot! if it doesn‚Äôt work for you, talk to your doctor and try something else, but you won‚Äôt know until you try.

wishing you the best!"
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"Oh gosh....I didn't realize it had horror stories. I'm taking the generic version of Wellbutrin and it's been really nice for me. Not exactly ""life changing"" but it's taken my anxiety down to what I feel is probably ""normal"" levels. (Like being a little nervous about hosting a dinner for my husbands parents, but NOT having panic attacks from being in a noisy crowd for too long)   


I had a few mild side effects that mostly went away after the first two weeks. I don't THINK it is addictive as I have forgotten to take it several times. I eventually had to put it where I knew it would be in my way so I'd remember. I DID have some problems with nausea however after reading up on it I found it's best to take Wellbutrin with food. Since I've been doing that I've had no problem.  


As others have mentioned I DO notice dry mouth...but I actually really like it because it gets me to drink more water. (I used to forget to drink, constantly.)"
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I‚Äôve been so soo happy with Wellbutrin. Started at 150mg, now at 300mg. It‚Äôs part of my morning meds. When I first started I‚Äôd get a little zippy for like 30min or so after it started to absorb but that no longer happens. It‚Äôs offered a great base for my depression so I don‚Äôt dip too low. It‚Äôs quieted the static noise in my head which has made a HUGE impact on my anxiety. Like imagine a radio always playing at full blast being turned down 80-90%. My mood is more regulated and all of these things have helped my ADHD. I still have challenging days but they‚Äôre fewer and I‚Äôm not so hard on myself about it."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I'm on it for depression and it's been fine. Helped me more than Zoloft, I've been on about a month. Bit of headaches, but that's it. I do know that you want to make sure you don't skip a dose. I have a friend who is on it and they felt awful the next day or two. Just remember to take your pills and don't quit without guidance from your doc."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,I‚Äôve been on it for a few years now. Up to 450mg.
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,I take Wellbutrin. It has worked wonders for me with no adverse effects.
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,I‚Äôm on Wellbutrin for a couple of years now with zero issues from it
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I liked it a lot. I've taken a few meds for ADHD and liked that one the best. Unfortunately, I could not stay on it because it exacerbated my hand tremors too much. But in terms of combating ADHD symptoms it was great"
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I‚Äôve been on it for over 5 years and it‚Äôs totally changed my life for the better. I absolutely love it. Gives me the ability to function and keep after tasks / goals. Oh, and no terrible sexual side effects like on SSRI."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I began taking it for serious brain fog and fatigue my entire life, after adderall didn‚Äôt work. I went from sleeping 12 hours a day and foggy to sleeping a normal amount and the brain fog clearing a lot more.
Just jumped on something to also help the hyper activity.
I feel like I‚Äôm living my life for the first time

I remember taking it the first time. That thick adhd brain fog / fatigue was the reason I was laying down. And things just started brightening around me. Colors began brighter, light became easier to see. I began noticing things in my environment I never noticed...in my own house...

Since this was a lifelong problem up until now.. we‚Äôll if the problem isn‚Äôt solved in 30 years... I‚Äôm okay being dependent on it . Because my normal  baseline was terrible.

You couldn‚Äôt pay me enough to stop taking it.

(Adhd person here if it wasn‚Äôt obvious)"
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"Hi! So first off: are you on any other meds? Or just Wellbutrin? Wellbutrin is a great antidepressant. It is a lil bit helpful for ADHD but there are much better ADHD medications.

Wellbutrin was super helpful for me in pulling me out of depression (although ultimately I needed actual ADHD meds to really function). It's a great medication. It isn't addictive in the normal sense although it's a good idea to taper off of any antidepressant. I didn't have any side effects on Wellbutrin (in fact it helped alleviate the side effects of my other antidepressant).

You won't feel anything the first time you take it -- antidepressants are effective over time, but it usually takes a few weeks. Unlike adderall which hits right away.

 Don't worry too much! wellbutrin is safe and well-tolerated. If it gives you side effects you can stop. It's gonna be okay."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I‚Äôve been on it for a year! Worked great, still does but adding adderall on top of it a few months ago has helped even more. It‚Äôs not a magic cure but definitely helps feel more like a functional human and I don‚Äôt get as overwhelmed and depressed as I used to."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,Wellbutrin is the single most impactful thing I've had to control my symptoms. It's fantastic and gives me lots of energy compared to what i had before. I take 300mg
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I've been taking welbutrin for about 20 years now. It doesn't help much, but it is better than not being on it. I can't really say how it helps, I was taking it for depression and it didn't help, but it did help with something. I am sure now that I know why I am taking it,  if I stop I will know what it is doing."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I've been taking it since mid-August. It helped my depression/anxiety a lot, but unfortunately it didn't do much to improve my focus. At first, I felt that ""TV static"" feeling go away, like someone else mentioned, but that leveled out back to normal after a few days. Also, you may notice you get constipated and/or dehydrated more often. Drink a lot of water. The constipation and stomachaches went away after a while, but I still have to drink more than I used to. You have a pretty low dose to start with, which is good, it'll help you get used to whatever side effects you have."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,I don‚Äôt have a good story because I got a rash and had to go off of it right away but I‚Äôve never heard anyone say it was addictive. I think it is a relatively safe medication all things considered
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I've been taking it for depression for like...five years. It's probably the mildest safest most widely prescribed antidepressant with the fewest side effects. It can induce a mild manic type feeling when you first start it, but as it's a stimulant, if you truly have adhd, it should more likely work to level you out. 

I'm honestly confused and shocked by you saying you found horror stories, I've met people who didn't feel a difference on it, but I've never met anyone who had a bad experience.

ETA: No, it is not habit forming, you don't have to do a taper to get off of it, and it doesn't hurt anything to miss a few doses. 

Actually, the only side effect I've ever experienced is some nerve based itchiness, which only comes up if I drink too much caffeine, particularly in the afternoon. I've only met a couple other people who know what I'm talking about, LOL, but yeah, it is a mild stimulant. So there are those kinds of potential interactions."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,I‚Äôve been taking it for just over a year - 300mg XR. Originally prescribed it for depression. I don‚Äôt feel much different but it has overall reduced my depression and most notably my anxiety. I‚Äôve had no side effects and truly just feel more like myself. I take mine at night and never have any issues sleeping.
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I‚Äôve been on Wellbutrin for half a year now and I haven‚Äôt had a single bad experience with it. It really just depends on the person though, since it affects everyone differently. The 2nd day after taking it, I could already start feeling the effects from it. My mood got a lot better, I was less agitated, I was finally getting the stimulation my brain needed, and it gives me just enough energy to get through my day without feeling really depressed and agitated again. It is not addictive, but if you plan to ever stop taking it you need to slowly wean off of it instead of quitting cold turkey. I had a couple headaches the first week of taking it, but it was nothing Tylenol couldn‚Äôt fix. They also stopped happening after the first week. I wish you the best with it!!"
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"have been on it for several years now and it‚Äôs the only antidepressant that has worked for me (and not come with a bunch of side effects) ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 

was prescribed it pre-adhd diagnosis so i can‚Äôt recall if it helped w adhd symptoms too since i didn‚Äôt recognize adhd symptoms for what they were at the time, but i‚Äôve also been on concerta now for 2 years and that def helped lol."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,Ive only ever heard good things about wellbutrin
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"Heyo, I was prescribed Wellbutrin for a while, unfortunately I don‚Äôt remember the dose. The biggest benefit was the fact I didn‚Äôt want to smoke when taking these meds, I believe because I wasn‚Äôt as understimulated as I would be without meds. They definitely helped me with my restlessness problem and finding balance with stimulation. 

You don‚Äôt have to worry about getting addicted, out of all the ADHD meds I‚Äôve been prescribed, Wellbutrin was the one I never got withdrawals from. From my understanding of what my doctor told me, It‚Äôs not really considered a stimulant so potential for dependancy should be low. 

I stopped taking it because I was getting irritable but I also have bipolar so I would take that with a grain of salt. 

It‚Äôs a decent med, not my favourite or the most effective for me, but I definitely recommend calling a pharmacy if you have further questions. 

Also, when trying out new meds, I‚Äôve found tracking my mood on a scale of 10, (along with my dosage/ any factors that could be effecting my symptoms like food, sleep, exercise, social time, hobbies, sex, etc,) really helped me understand not only what meds worked for me but also what habits i need to continue/stop to manage my symptoms"
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I loved it, it was the first ever antidepressant I tried. But alas, it eventually gave me hives. Which I read can be an issue as it promotes histamine production."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"Best anti-depressant I ever tried. I had more energy, lucidity, a high libido, and could easily function day to day. Unfortunately over time the good effects wore off and I became flat, but I got an incredible 5 months or so out of it. I hope your experience is better!"
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,I am prescribed it. It's nice it kind of gives you a little juice but isn't like super intense. It also takes away my negative emotions. I am going to probably need to take Adderall with it though cus it does not help my focus as well as it should.
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I was just prescribed Wellbutrin XR 150mg starting and 300mg after a week. This is after being prescribed 5 to 10mg and then 15 to 20mg of Adderall which did little to nothing for me.

Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I quite like it. It was the 3rd edition to my drug cocktail of Lamictal, and Lexapro.

Only for a week or two though."

Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,Took it for 3 months and noticed no benefits so I stopped taking it. Eventually ended up trying a couple other things that have been far more effective
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"It basically disabled suicidal ideation and depression near instantly but over time I noticed weird memory lapses, like forgetting close friends' names and not enjoying sex that much so I stopped.

Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I love it. It was prescribed to me because of the side effects I got from SSRIs, and it has been amazing. I don‚Äôt plan on every getting off of it. It made me a little bit jittery in the beginning but that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm happier, I function better, and I have a lot more control over my mood swings.

Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"The first few days were tough for me but i was on 150mg. Dont sweat it. Are you a smoker? Because they were for me to get off smoking. I was in the same boat but decided to trust my psychiatrist and I found it extremely helpful
Edit: not addicting ime, the first few days youre kind of crackhead level energy but it subsides quickly. It can assist with focus as well depending on the intensity of your adhd"
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I was on it for a few years because doctors are nervous about stimulants. 

I had no side effects. I also had no good affect on my ADHD. All it did was make me mellow and calm, when I should not have been, so I blew off doing our personal and business taxes for three years and it all snowballed into a massive, $80K debt that may never get paid off. 

Stimulants are the only thing that keeps me on track. I have heard that some people like Wellbutrin, and I imagine if I was depressed or had anxiety it would have been helpful, but I don;t so it wasn't. 

Your mileage may vary of course!"
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"It was a freaking godsend for me. I‚Äôve struggled for years with suicidal ideation/call of the void when I get really depressed. Zoloft helped some when I initially got on it - but I think that‚Äôs just because it muted everything. 

Wellbutrin (initially 150mg XR, now 300xr - shrink up‚Äôs it while waiting for my ADHD diagnosis and I did see a little difference)‚Ä¶ it took that impulse/call of the void and hog tied it, duck taped its mouth shut, and locked it in a dark closet in the back of my mind.

It made my husband‚Äôs depression worse, but the good news is it doesn‚Äôt take very long to get to therapeutic levels in your body, and doesn‚Äôt take long to get off it. I never had much in the way of withdrawals the couple times I stoped taking it for some stupid reason that I inevitably regretted shortly thereafter. If it makes you feel like crap to the point where you don‚Äôt want to be on it until you talk to the doc - just know you‚Äôll need to ride out a couple days before the problems will stop. Knowing something will end makes suffering through things easier for me."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I'm not sharing my exp here because you have enough yay and nay responses.

I would say your dr RXd it to try as a treatment option. You'll have to see how you do and keep your dr aware of how you're doing and feeling and any concerns. Get off the internet for this one.

Most of the meds I've been on for anxiety and such have a ""ramp up"" type of period - so it may be a week or 2 to feel ""better"" sometimes a month (I think welbutrin is a month?)

As for how you're supposed to feel? That depends on why you were given then rx. If it was for depression then you should feel less depressed, anxiety then more ""even"". Adhd? Able to focus better, quieter mind, that stuff. Probably pretty energetic at first, but that tones down a bit."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,Been working well for me for about 7 or so years
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,I was on 150mg ‚Äî they didn‚Äôt do anything to me
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I‚Äôm on Wellbutrin XL 300 mg. It‚Äôs really helped with my crippling depression and is mildly activating, so it can be useful for adhd. You are unlikely to really notice much difference at first. Just give it time and see how you tolerate it or if it helps your symptoms. It is a very old, well studied drug that is quite safe. It is not addictive. I‚Äôve known some people to develop a slight, transient tremor when their dosage is too high. You are starting on a pretty low dose. You are right to want to ask questions about it, but i don‚Äôt  think you have much to worry about.  I hope it helps you."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I was on it for a few months at 300mg with no impact at all. It wasn't until my dosage was increased to 450mg after a month or so that I started to feel any changes, and at that point I felt very emotionally stable and clearheaded. But I also had side effects with waking up 2-3 hours before my alarm each night, and some strange anxiety/panic attack like issues. I don't typically have anxiety, so this was abnormal. Eventually stopped to switch over to just a stimulant. 

It was very easy to taper off, compared to a few other similar medications I've tried in the past (Effexor, another NRI, comes to mind as being particularly challenging for me)."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I take Wellbutrin, concerta, and lexapro. It hasn‚Äôt been a magic bullet for focus but my anxiety is remarkably low. I feel like I have a really balanced perspective on things in my life but am not a zombie."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"Got prescribed Wellbutrin after taking Zoloft for a few months for depression. While Zoloft had helped my general mood, I still had pretty intense energy and motivation issues. (I also didn‚Äôt know I had ADHD at this time.)

It kind of became my ‚Äúmain‚Äù antidepressant, and overall I‚Äôve been happy with it. Side effects are a little hard to parse given I took it at the same time as Zoloft, but what I did notice was increased acne and sweating. Bit of temperature regulation issues, too. 

It has overall been beneficial for my day to day energy and motivation. Back when I entered my depressive episode, it was a struggle to find any reason to get out of bed. Once I was on Wellbutrin, I could function. 

Of course, I was later diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed Adderall XR, which had a profound effect on my ability to focus that Wellbutrin hadn‚Äôt been able to help. 

But, nevertheless, I managed to make it through about 2/3 of my final year of college on Wellbutrin before Adderall was added. And that was totally remote, too. 

So I say it‚Äôs worth a shot. Sending best of luck!"

Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"At that dose I had no side effects. Later on, with an increased dose, I had a few weird ones but nothing quality of life ruining. The big thing is it was harder to feel hungry/tired, which wasn‚Äôt an issue once I got into a routine."

Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,Its been fantastic!
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I've been on wellbutrin for about 5 or 6 months now and I didnt even realize it had a bad rap.

I've had no issues with it aside from getting a stomach ache if I take it in the morning before I eat breakfast; I ended up just switching to taking it at night which works for me and doesnt interfere with my sleep.  I think it has helped me with a range of daily symptoms to some degree (but not really obvious or life changing results), but I'm actually starting adderall to see if I can get better results from that.

EDIT: I've been on 450 mg, to clarify."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I'll chime in here too.  I've taken 175 mg extended release for a few years.  I get a small boost in focus and maybe energy.  I take it with Abilify and Strattera.   

Maybe talk about feeling nervous with your psych provider, they may be able to help one way or another.

And don't forget the fundamentals, ofc, diet exercise and sleep all have big effects too

Good luck OP!  Hope you find what works for you."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,I was put on Wellbutrin when we first suspected I had adhd. Turns out that it didn‚Äôt help the adhd stuff too much for me but did WONDERS for my depression. It did suppress my appetite a little bit so I had to watch that. But it did help me lose a little weight so that was a bonus.
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I‚Äôve been on it for a couple months! I switched to it after figuring out Zoloft didn‚Äôt work for me.

Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,It‚Äôs been great for me!! I‚Äôm on 200 mg a day abs it has done wonders for my anxiety and depression. My younger sister (who also has ADHD) takes it with her meds as well. I once skipped half a dose and it hurt my head for the next few days. Nothing like going off of ADHD meds though
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"General physician put me on Wellbutrin, but eventually I got into psych and was taken off of it due to hand tremors. Unfortunate, because it worked really well for two years with zero other side effects. 

The worst experience I‚Äôve ever had with a drug was Vyvanse, which a lot of people swear by. Everyone‚Äôs neurochemistry is different."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I've taken Wellbutrin before and had a very good experience. No side effects at all.

No mental health medication is addicting so there's no worries there (always take it as prescribed though). Are you thinking of how it's bad to stop taking your medication cold turkey? While this is true, and has something in common with addiction, that does not mean your medication is addicting. It means that your body has come to rely on it, which is the point when you think about it. You aren't addicted  anymore than a diabetic is addicted to insulin.


Whenever I want to look up medical information I go to the the Mayo Clinic website first and then look for the information. If you just google it you're as likely to find nonsense as something useful so why do this to yourself?


My top tip for any new medication is to take as prescribed, but if you start feeling really shitty stop taking it immediately and talk to your doctor."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"It saved my life. I tried many others and they made it worse or didn‚Äôt help at all. It helped to bring me out of a serious depressive state.

I hope you find success but if it doesn‚Äôt work for you doesn‚Äôt mean something else can‚Äôt. So keep trying."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,I've been on Wellbutrin a couple times and it was a very effective anti-depressant.
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"This was the only antidepressant that didn‚Äôt just mess me up and send me into the atmosphere. 

My suggestion is keep a journal about your own personal experiences with medications because Everyone
Is 
So 
Different. 

Among ADHD folk, I find them more familiar than NT. 

But it may behoove us all to remember that we each have our own biochemistry and our experiences with pharmaceuticals will differ depending on mileage, biochemistry, and the alike."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"What is happening? My doc wanted to start me on Wellbutrin in Nov and that was the first time I‚Äôd heard of it really. I‚Äôm a very late diagnosis, so admittedly there are a lot of medications that I‚Äôm in the dark about. But it seemed like I‚Äôd only just  heard about it for adhd then and then I see it everywhere on here."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,I developed a stutter for the first month or two. It was such a weird feeling. It went away after that though.
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"My sister is on Wellbutrin and loves it

I tried it two years ago and it kept me up for 4 days straight.

Any new med is a roll of the dice."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I‚Äôve been on it for several months, just increased my dose to 300mg. It‚Äôs been amazing. Reduces anxiety and depression, helps with motivation and energy and feels like mild adderall. I still take adderall but I love the combo. Side effects last a few weeks but they‚Äôre so mild compared to SSRIs. It‚Äôs mainly headache if combined with alcohol and dry mouth"
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I take 100 mg of Wellbutrin also, but for depression mostly. I have struggled with excessive sleeping over the last few years, and being on SSRIs definitely made that worse. Switching to Wellbutrin helped a lot with my drowsiness. However, the first several months on it, I did tend to have a very short temper and I was really irritable. After a while everything kind of leveled out though, but I would say that it doesn't help with anxiety very much, especially since it does typically have a stimulating effect on your body.

For ADHD, I've noticed that it does help with some of the brain fog and fatigue you can get. Seems to make my Adderall work better since I typically take it with my first dose of Adderall during the day (I take 15 mg of Adderall IR twice a day, once in the morning, once in the afternoon. I would also say a combination of these two medications has significantly contributed to losing a substantial amount of weight, but I also did gain a fair amount of weight on SSRIs. 

Only ongoing issue for me is migraines, my psychiatrist and I are currently working on figuring out if my migraines are tied to my current med combo or not. Other than that, I've definitely noticed an improvement in my fatigue and brain fog the most, and those can be some of the most crippling parts of my ADHD for me."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I'm not on it now because of no insurance but was on it for years. Nothing short of a miracle drug for me. First time I had it I was in the hospital for suicidal ideation. After 3 days on Wellbutrin I was fine. Literally fine. Life wasn't perfect but I could handle things. So as an anti depressant, I give it 10/10. Didn't do much for my ADHD though. I don't remember any side effects. I was on 300mg when I stopped."

Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I was prescribed Wellbutrin prior to the ADHD diagnosis. Have been on it for years, I really like it. I noticed a pretty quick difference when I started it (a few years ago now). Am now on it in addition to Concerta with no complaints."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I was on 100mg last month and 200mg this month. I‚Äôve experienced sleep issues (the witching hour that someone mentioned), anxiety (worse than usual), weight loss (5lbs so far), and irritability. I also had a skin rash for 48 hours, but unsure if it‚Äôs related.

I haven‚Äôt really noticed any improvements in my ADHD symptoms. Mayyybe a tiny difference, but that could just be me having a tight deadline at work so actually getting stuff done lol"
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,I have ADHD PI.  I started Wellbutrin 150 about a year ago and it helped a lot with my emotional dysregulation; I have previously been on several SSRIs  that technically worked but I felt so dead inside it wasn't worth it.  I was still struggling with executive dysfunction so I started Strattera for that. Between the two of them I've had a lot of success!
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,It did absolutely nothing for me. It broke my heart. But most probably it will help you like it helped everyone else.
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"It took me 3 years to finally get a mix of meds that worked for me.  People tolerate meds differently.  So really the reviews aren‚Äôt really indicative of what would work for you.

I‚Äôve been taking Wellbutrin for the whole time and that‚Äôs been the only constant.  I started it for depression and when it didn‚Äôt completely work i got dxed with ADHD.  A friend of mine couldn‚Äôt tolerate Wellbutrin at all.  I can‚Äôt tolerate prozac and effexor which is usually what the doctors try first.  My husband takes prozac and it works for him.  I wasn‚Äôt even allowed to try zoloft because my sister had bad side effects on it.  Now i am on trintrillex.  It‚Äôs prescribed once two first line meds have failed.  It works wonders for me.

I take both Wellbutrin extended and instant release.  The second time i fell into depression during covid the doc prescribed me 100mg instant release and i felt a difference the next day.  This is when i was already on 300mg extended release"
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,It didn‚Äôt help me personally very much but nothing bad happened. I felt ever so slightly more focused.
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I took it and had no side effects, but it also didn‚Äôt help. Basically did nothing. I tried 2 or maybe 3 different times, many years apart."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,it takes away my desire to eat which i hate it so much i stopped taking it
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I found Wellbutrin helpful for a little while, but I think I must have gotten too acclimated to it or something. After a couple months the effects weren‚Äôt as noticeable and I felt a lot of my symptoms re-emerge. But I had no bad experiences on it, it just wasn‚Äôt quite what I needed!"
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"The efficacy from my experience with Wellbutrin and amphetamine XR, is completely wiped out.
In other words I don't feel the amphetamine/Adderall XR.

I know this wasn't OP's query per se, however I had to stop Wellbutrin because of this. And it's really not a phenomenon it's pretty common, as I've read this many times and experienced it obviously as well"
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,I tried it a while ago and it made me aggressively moody and psychotic. Turns out I am OCD as well so that makes sense.
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,I took it for a couple months and then tapered myself off.
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,450mg squad for many many years.
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,I've been on 300 mg for 4 or more years. It's my life line honestly. It helps with crippling depression. When my depression got better my adhd was more apparent. I ended up having to get other medication in addition for my adhd. I hope it works out for you! Ive noticed family members who start it get sensitive to sound and irritable at first.
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I took 300mg for about a year but had to stop because it was making me very manic and unstable.  I am already an extreme insomniac and I stayed up until 5am for a few months and it was terrible.  I went down to 150mg and it helped, but after a while I decided it was not the right meds for me.  Anti depressants are known to make people with mood disorders like me more manic, so it wasn‚Äôt a good fit.  However, I do believe it helped a lot with motivation and executive function.  Since I‚Äôve stopped taking it I‚Äôve noticed that those traits have dwindled and I‚Äôm right back to being dysfunctional and disorganized.  I‚Äôd rather that though than be off my rocker"
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,Probably the best ssri for adhd but it made me sleep all the time.
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"Did nothing for me by itself, but I still take 300mg with adderall xr. It‚Äôs more of an antidepressant for me, the adderall does the heavy work for energy and focus."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I was prescribed it for my depression before I knew I had ADHD. It gave me some of my energy back. I did have some side effects from it, but to me it was worth it. The main side effect I had was night sweats- about 4-5 nights a week I'd wake up in the middle of the night drenched in sweat. Only other side effect I noticed was slightly more easier to get dehydrated, but I'm pretty good about drinking water through the day so I was able to manage this one."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,Fuck Wellbutrin it gave me a seizure
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,I was prescribed wellbutrin for depression before adhd diagnosis. I took 150 mg for 5-6 weeks and for me it didn't do anything positive. I always felt really dizzy and in the beginning i had problems with extremly shaky hands (i work in a lab so a big no go).
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"Nothing significantly bad for me, I would say it's worth trying. The effects are subtle, I haven't slipped into a prolonged depressive state since I've been on it with Adderall. Since upping my dose I find I need to eat a decent meal with my meds to prevent becoming too anxious. Nothing crazy, just feels like drinking too much coffee.

Early on I did have one weird episode. I felt this intense fidgeting urge. I always feel a need to fidget, but this time I felt like I needed to be walking, swinging my arms, shaking my legs out etc... I ended up throwing on exercise shorts and going for a run. I was on a trail behind my apartment complex, got somewhere secluded, sat down, and then just started laughing in this compulsive and unnatural way. After that I started to settle down and it never happened again. 

Doctor said it was an effect of norepinephrine levels changing. Maybe even getting out of balance as I adjusted to the medication. It was weird, but again nothing like that has happened since."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,I have had a lot of success with Welbutrin. I took it 4 years ago to quit smoking and was successful. I kept taking it after I quit because it was helping me. I recently got back on and I would say so far it's been very helpful and things are getting back on track.
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,I‚Äôve been taking it for almost a week and I have cramps and lost a bit of weighted supposedly that‚Äôs normal for the first week thoughü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I was on Wellbutrin for years and legit, I credit it with helping me graduate from college! I used to get so depressed and anxious that I would skip class constantly just to lay in bed, but once I was medicated it helped me break that cycle. Just try to keep an eye on your emotions and thoughts, maybe keep a journal/tracker, and you should be fine!"
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,I took it for a while and it was helpful. The hardest part was remembering to take it.
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,I personally really didn‚Äôt like it. It didn‚Äôt help with any of my symptoms. I was on it for two years
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,I've been in Wellbutrin for years the only negative side effect I ever had was when I was on 300mg and the side effect was vivid dreams. Other than that literally no negatives.
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I had awful depression for 5 years. Went through 17 different meds till my dr put me on zyban/wellbutrin. Changed my life, massive improvement in my mood which meant I was getting some tasks done."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I take wellbutrin 300 XR I‚Äôve been taking it for three years now. I was prescribed it when I told my psychiatrist that I don‚Äôt like when antidepressants take away my sex drive, so he gave me Wellbutrin. No other ssri worked for me they always made me more apathetic and tired. I love Wellbutrin, it takes a little while for your body to regulate it. This pill makes me feel like a normal person, I have emotions and motivation for once. 

My recommendation is that if your taking Wellbutrin and or a stimulant as well, wear a heart monitor so a Fitbit, Apple Watch etc because Wellbutrin and stimulates raise your heart rate to interesting levels so keep a eye out for that. 

Also make sure you always have a water bottle for dry mouth and a snack for the shakes

Another warning about this drug that doctors don‚Äôt tell you is: that you can‚Äôt just stop taking it because it leads to seizures and it can cause problems when your trying to get pregnant (if you eventually want to or whatever)"
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I tried Wellbutrin for a while when my Lexapro stopped working (unrelated but the Lexapro was wonderful for my depression). My friend told me that Wellbutrin changed her life, and she‚Äôs still on it and happy years later!

On my end, I had a sort of bizarre experience where I experienced almost no effects - negative or positive - except for one thing. I‚Äôd have nightmares and wake up screaming every single night. Literally every night like clockwork. I would have maybe kept on if I felt positive effects too, but since that was the only one, I weened off. Despite my weird experience, I don‚Äôt want you to be anxious because this could be the right medication for you and if it is, it could do you wonders. Good luck!"
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I have been taking welbutrin since 2019 and it's worked wonders for me. When I started I was put on 75mg and have worked my way up to 300mg over the first 2 year period (I'm 5'11 and 250 lbs I need a decent amount lol). 

The first few weeks I noticed that I felt very anxious in addition to little lightheaded-ness if I didn't eat with it. If you drink, be careful as i noticed my sensitivity to alcohol increased. Like 1-2 drinks and im feeling buzzed as opposed to the 3-4 it would take before. 
The most prominent and long lasting side effect I have is dry skin. 
 After that first month I felt a lot better. And I mean better as in I felt more focused and my emotions felt more balanced (like if I made a mistake or something upsetting happened I wouldn't spiral into a depressive episode, I feel like I'm able to bounce back a lot more quickly). Like the little things that would throw me off track, I can function through now. 
I wouldn't say welbutrin is addictive. I know there's been days where I've missed my dose or I had to wait for my pharmacy to fill it, and I feel off/out of it but its not like I'm going through withdrawl. With any mental medication just like slowly increasing the dosage you slowly decrease the dosage as well if you want to switch or come off of it completely. 

It's frustrating bc things like this take time but just take it slowly. Everyone reacts differently to medications. Be open with your doctor. Something that really helped me was tracking my mood. I did it in my planner, but there's apps too. And as always if you have any questions, ask your doctor or the pharmacist. If I had any questions pop up in my head  I would jot it down in my notes app and made sure I asked on my follow up appointment or when I picked up my next refill. 

Good luck!"
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,i was prescribed wellbutrin as an alternative to xanax (bc no one wants to prescribe xanax thx to it being abused) and i think the way in interacted with my SSRI (citalopram) is what messed me up. i don‚Äôt want to scare you but it sent me into hysterics and i was having so many intrusive suicidal thoughts that i tried to hospitalize myself (which i couldn‚Äôt afford to do) so i threw myself off then immediately. i haven‚Äôt had a breakdown like that in years and it definitely scared me deeply. i really hope it doesn‚Äôt affect you like that
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I‚Äôve been taking the 100mg for a few months and the side effects are slight (higher metabolism). It has helped with my ADHD. Not as much as the Adderall did, but with waaaay fewer side effects. Going up to the 150 next week."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,I have trouble with many neurological and psychiatric medications ( turns out part of the problem is I‚Äôm a poor processor with a particular liver enzyme ). Anyways Wellbutrin at a low dose worked well for me- I took it for depression for about 9 months and was able to wean myself off without issues. It helped me with very minimal side effects and I would recommend.
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I‚Äôve heard that if Wellbutrin/bupropion works well for u that, since it has stimulant effects, it can be an indicator of adhd. 
I personally take Wellbutrin and lexapro, as well as topamax and adderall. Have been taking the Wellbutrin and lexapro as antidepressants since before adhd diagnosis as a combo to manage anxiety and then lexapro-induced low energy. As far as I can tell neither are addictive or tolerance-creating. I didn‚Äôt like Wellbutrin because it gave me energy back where lexapro took it away, but with that came anxiety. But without it I can‚Äôt function-I can‚Äôt get out of bed. For me it‚Äôs been a great medication though it‚Äôs also messed with my sleep cycle (if you have sleep problems look at melatonin or talk to ur doc about trazodone?). 
Do you have more specific questions?"
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I take wellbutrin 300mg. I took lexapro 10mg before that. I have less impulse to eat than on lexapro.

Don't take it at night, lol. I learned the hard way that itll screw up your sleep. Even if you take a sleeping med.

Otherwise, I don't have anything negative or postive to say. It didn't really help me at all with my symptoms (dep/anx/motivation/interests)"
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"Been on 100mg for 6 weeks. Dramatic improvements in sleep (vivid and fucked up dreams at times). I get so much done and it feels good to sense the improvement in my overall mood to the thought of having to go about my days tasks. I do get sad at times but those spells don‚Äôt last long. When they do I just pick up the phone and talk to someone I love. It does scare me how effective this drug is at times, but the benefits outweigh the cons.  Take it a day at a time."

Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,Great for mood stability and depression. Did nothing for adhd symptoms in my case.
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,Female here. I have been taking the described dose now for a week and a half. For major depression and I suspect mild ADHD and anxiety. I feel fantastic although there have been some side effects. My sleep is the biggest concern. First week I barely slept and when I did fall asleep I had vivid dreams and my sleep was very light. I was prescribed trazodone and ended up taking it a couple of nights because I was so exhausted. It helped a bit. The past couple of nights I have been able to sleep better without the trazodone which is a relief. I do have a bit of constipation despite eating a clean diet with lots of fibre. Dry mouth. My ability to orgasm has also been impacted. I‚Äôve had to resort to using toys with my partner to get me there. Less feeling to the area I suspect. It‚Äôs all been worth it though so far. I feel a noticeable difference and almost feel normal. It‚Äôs a relief. Goodluck to you!

My right eye isnt as crisp as it was 2 weeks ago but not as bad as my left. Doctor said go to the eye doctor...ok but I was fine untill I started taking this. Why dump money into a new prescription for only it to be the meds. Lol  Does this go away...because I'm not sure I can stand not seeing when I already have glasses.
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I was diagnosed with ADHD relatively recently and after a few months turning over the idea with my therapist decided I was interested in trying out medication to help with symptoms, found a psychiatrist, met with her a few times, then was prescribed wellbutrin XL 150mg in conjunction with 10mg adderall extended release... but even after all that, I was still so nervous to try it because of the horror stories I read online that I didn't take it for 2 months after the prescription... but then one day I remembered my biological aunt and cousin have both been on it (for depression & ADHD) and after speaking with them found that neither had any bad reactions so I figured I had a good chance with my own biological reaction since theirs was fine...and I was right! It's been great and I wish I had never waited. I started with just the adderall and the only way to describe it was that I think I felt peaceful concentration for the first time, but later when I brought the wellbutrin into the mix (and after another month of letting it build up in my system) I felt calm motivation for the first time. With ADHD, I have felt the motivation and concentration that comes along with a hyperfocus episode, but the feelings or actions were always clouded in obsession and/or anxiety with little to no control over the direction of the episode on my part. Both medications have helped relieve my mind of the cripplingly intrusive stream of anxious and depressive thoughts and have given me access to clear intention, but CBT is really what has given me the tools I needed to work with my ADHD instead of against it and to find a balance in my daily life instead of just masking and managing symptoms.

TLDR: Try not to let the internet scare you off, because you never know unless you try & everyone's experience is different. If you're super worried about bad reactions to it, maybe check if anyone who is biologically related to you has taken it and check if they had any bad reactions, if they didn't then you're more likely not to as well. Regardless of what medication you end up taking,  cognitive behavior therapy is the real MVP in my book."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"Been on it for almost two months, im near apathetic and more depressed, yet anxiety free. It was working well the first month, but after that its been a downward spiral. Good luck, it isn't for everyone"
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I am undergoing ADHD testing currently so I don't have a diagnosis, but I started taking wellbutrin (and lamotrigine) because I cannot tolerate SSRIs for depression or anxiety.

It's helped so much with low moods and increasing my energy levels, and it's literally saved my life. However, it hasn't helped too much with focus or anxiety yet and I have noticed increased irritability. I am currently only on 300 mg XL but will be upping it to 450 mg XL (the max dosage) in a couple of days. Depending on ADHD symptom severity, my psychiatrist told me that usually inattention improvement is noticed at or above 300 mg."

Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,When I first started taking it I became so much more *able* to do things and it made me anxious.

I ask as I was prescribed Wellbutrin (started 150 XL, now 300 XL) and I do like it OK, for the depression.  I was diagnosed with ADHD a week ago and will be seeing a psychiatrist on the 28th.  I don‚Äôt feel the Wellbutrin is doing much for ADHD symptoms and actually feel it‚Äôs making some symptoms (forgetting everything!!) worse.  I‚Äôm just wondering if they‚Äôll maybe do a combo of Wellbutrin + an ADHD specific medication."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,It's like reading the 5 star and 1 star reviews on an item. Loved it or hated it. Read the 3 star reviews - those usually get closer to the truth (and people are more inclined to share negative experiences than positive)

Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,Most people come online to complain rather than commend things
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"It‚Äôs easy to get freaked out by hearing bad experiences of drugs but really all you can do is see for yourself how you react. I know people who have been on it for years with no side effects and they find it helpful for depression and ADHD. My brother recently started taking it and said he felt kinda ‚Äúflat‚Äù at first and a little spaced out but that passed after a week or 2. Good luck. Hope it helps you. Remember all meds affect people differently. Hopefully it helps but if it‚Äôs not for you, you can always get off it."

Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,Yes extended release
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,I stand corrected! Maybe it‚Äôs for depression that it takes longer? Regardless it sounds like y‚Äôall are having a better time than me!
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,I felt the change by day 3 on 150mg but I felt it on the first day going up to 300mg. Most of my friends told me they saw the improvement within a week as well.
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,I stand corrected! Maybe it‚Äôs for depression that it takes longer? Regardless it sounds like y‚Äôall are having a better time than me!
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,Same. My depression was like 90% gone on day 3. It was the most amazing thing in the universe.
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,I think I am having the same experience‚ÄîI just took my second pill ever and already my brain is quieter. It‚Äôs strange.
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I‚Äôm only on day 2 and i definitely could feel it my first day. I‚Äôm taking 30 mg adderall xr, and 150 mg Wellbutrin.
It‚Äôs like all of the ‚Äúbad‚Äù side effects of adderall are gone once I added the Wellbutrin. No irritability, no racing heart.
I do have dry mouth, no appetite, and a hard time staying asleep at night, but it‚Äôs soo worth it. I feel 100% better than when I was taking just the adderall. 
But we will see‚Ä¶ I know it takes time for our bodies to adjust."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,Same. I felt a noticeable positive difference the first day I took it.
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"Similar situation here. I was prescribed Wellbutrin for depression and have been on it for 7 years at 300mg. Got diagnosed with ADHD two weeks ago and they added Adderall IR to my Wellbutrin. 

Adderrall definitely makes me feel better in a different way than Wellbutrin ever did, we just don‚Äôt want to change all my meds at once so I‚Äôm still taking Wellbutrin too. Good luck!"
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"Yes I take vyvanse as well. I‚Äôm honestly not completely sure how I feel about it for my ADHD, but it treats the binge eating disorder so I‚Äôm scared to ask about other options. 

I think a problem I have is my body seems to metabolize meds + build a tolerance very fast. Not just vyvanse, but seemingly anything I take. The dose just keeps being raised until we hit the ceiling. I guess that‚Äôs how I ended up with the ‚Äútreatment resistant depression‚Äù label."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I'm on Wellbutrin and Adderall, my only recommendation is to eat breakfast before taking them. Side effects were fine until my dosage for both increased, but got better when I ate breakfast."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,I‚Äôm on both. I don‚Äôt feel like my Wellbutrin does much. My adderall helps me get up and get going. Does it make a difference at what time you take the Wellbutrin? My doc told me to take it before bed
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"For me i thought I did when i stopped taking them in college due to lack of insurance.  Then a decade later after restarting it's clear I was just doing a good job of faking it and giving myself crap for being ""lazy"".

I'm sure some folks manage to keep ADHD under control with just therapy, but unfortunately I am not one of them."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"Hi! Yes, In short, I believe I was able to sustain the good side effects long term, and I am very grateful that I took it. 

Based on my experiences combined with others I‚Äôve spoken with, I‚Äôd like to think that Wellbutrin works the best as a temporary medication. It helped me bring myself completely out of a depressive state. Taking Wellbutrin really helped me grow, and I was doing relativity well even after stopping. 

With that being said, I did began medicating my ADHD for the first time 4-6 months after that point. That made the biggest difference for me, because having untreated ADHD began to halt the progress I made with Wellbutrin. 

All and all, Wellbutrin was a great medication! The only issue was that but my untreated ADHD was a  leading primarily cause of the issues I was having that led me to take Wellbutrin. 

I hope that helped and made sense! Feel free to ask me any more questions (:"
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,I was put on Prozac initially but didn‚Äôt love it and had to advocate for the switch
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I'm coming from searching on Google and wanted to give a different insight

To my doctor's eyes, my symptoms could've come from both conditions since i'm not diagnosed for any of them.

I tried one antidepressant (Cymbalta) and two stimulants (Vyvanse and Concerta). They didn't work.

Then came Wellbutrin, which can treat both conditions and holy hell... what a medication. 

I know it's 5 months old and I don't know your case, but talk about it to your psy. It did wonders for me."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I did, but I wound up switching to another one. Just talk to your doctor about it your concerns, they‚Äôll be able to tell you about the process of weaning off antidepressants. For some, it‚Äôs not a long term thing."

Good luck with your Botox. Anything to keep dentures at bay."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I should‚Äôve added, the making you crazy aspect is something that pretty much only happens if you‚Äôre bipolar, especially if you have bipolar 1. I‚Äôve heard the insomnia is common with a lot of people. So you probably don‚Äôt have to worry about psychosis"
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I drink very rarely. When I have, I‚Äôve found I have to take it slow because I get pretty drunk very quickly, which I guess is a side effect of Wellbutrin. 
I don‚Äôt think I have had alcohol since starting adderall, but I would imagine that as long as you wait until after it had worn off it wouldn‚Äôt be an issue at all, as long as you aren‚Äôt getting rip roaring drunk haha"
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"Well thats good you havent had any of the initial effects, they arent fun. Its works subtly in the background in my experience not psychoactive by any means"
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,It worked for a little while but alas i still vape
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"You should talk to your doctor! It seems you need to tackle the ADHD first, as many ADHD people have depression solely due to ADHD. Your doctor may listen to you and may be able to do an ADHD assessment for you. That's how I got diagnosed, and I am happy I approached her. I hope it works for you as well! :)"
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I felt irritable the first days up into week 2. Week 2 is when I started noticing the effects on certain behaviors like keeping a morning routine in check. Week 3-4 and are the ‚Äúoh shit it‚Äôs working how do I sustain this‚Äù weeks now I‚Äôm just rolling like a snowball down the hill. This is some cliche ass advice but Try to implement a little journalism day to day. You‚Äôll start to notice a different in thinking patterns to towards big tasks or hard days. Those days are big ones to take note of. Are you taking it for depression?

It‚Äôs why I decided to. 
Round 4 of attempting to find ‚Äúthe one‚Äù 
On this path,  I‚Äôve discovered an untreated ADHD diagnosis and this helps with those symptoms as well. One thing for sure is it can be kind of troublesome to figure out how to not think about what it‚Äôs doing."

Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,Took about 2 or 3 weeks for any noticeable difference in my anxiety. Only relatively quick thing it did to me was give me insomnia.
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"Thank you!!  This is just the info I‚Äôm curious about.  I know I‚Äôll find out in a couple weeks but I‚Äôm just anxious to know now.  Shocker, I know lol.  I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôve found a good mix to help you!"
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"Did you need to decrease your bupropion dose at all? I might be wrong, but I think both wellbutrin and adderall works on norepinephrine and dopamine - did your prescriber have any concerns about 'too much' dopamine if that's possible? 

I only ask cuz I will be on 450 mg soon and, depending on if my tests indicate ADHD, may be put on a stimulant as well."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I can relate with this so much!  I was so happy with Wellbutrin for the first 4 weeks.  My emotional/binge eating was non-existent.  I was amazed.  Unfortunately it was pretty short lived as around week 6 my symptoms started to creep back in.  I hoped switching to 300 would make a much bigger difference than it‚Äôs seemed to.  I have only been on the 300 for one week though, so perhaps I need to give it a bit more time.

Would some of the other brand names still help with your BED?  Adderrall or Ritalin?  I‚Äôm very new so I don‚Äôt know all the names yet."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,Thank you so much for the helpful tip!
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"Ah ok, thanks for the info!  Maybe I can discuss the time taken with my Dr.  Right now I take the 300 XL each morning, about 7am.

I will say that first week or two on Wellbutrin it was getting me up and going!  It was helping everything a lot!  It seemed to dwindle pretty quick though."
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,Sounds like we‚Äôre in the same boat. It‚Äôs been about 7 years for me without stimulants and considering to go back on medication again. Hope you have success on your journeyüôèüèª
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I take Wellbutrin as a permanent medication. Since my mental health is like ~ my brain, I‚Äôm not expecting my brain to change and for me to suddenly be able to stop because when I stop my brain is ultimately unchanged. I‚Äôve worked for so long to fight my brain, but now I‚Äôm working with it. It‚Äôs rlly interesting to see perspectives of people who have such different usage of medications than me !"
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"Thank you! This is actually relieving to here. There‚Äôs so many testimonies online that it‚Äôs hard to make a decision. 

I‚Äôm glad it worked for many people including yourself! It seems that untreated ADHD may have caused the rest of the issues. It‚Äôs such a shame that it‚Äôs so tough for doctors to prescribe. I also have to go in for a re-evaluation for adhd. For now they have placed me on Wellbutrin."

Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"Yeah, as someone mentioned in another comment somewhere (I identified with it, kept scrolling, no idea where it is now hahah), Adderall makes the world feel quieter, like someone turned down the volume. It‚Äôs answering the thoughts I can process when there‚Äôs a quiet calm going on up there ü§Ø"
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,Yes I‚Äôve been titrating off Wellbutrin for about two months now and will stop taking it this week. My prescribers want to see if Adderall can ‚Äúhandle‚Äù all of my issues on its own without the Wellbutrin crutch
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,There‚Äôs a med called trintellix I got prescribed and it helped boost the Wellbutrin but it made my adderall not work as well and it is really expensive even with insurance. I would feel semi brain foggy and seem zoned out after taking my adderall when I had the trintellix in my system.
Please reply if you‚Äôve been prescribed Wellbutrin,"I agree, and I‚Äôm very glad that Wellbutrin works for you!! I have to medicate my ADHD with amphetamine/dextroamphetamine stimulant medication because I am greatly deficit in dopamine. Wellbutrin helped, but it certainly wasn‚Äôt a fix due to its norepinephrine-dopamine ratio. I hope my reply didn‚Äôt make you feel like I was dismissing those who take Wellbutrin long term as I was simply sharing my personal experience. (:"

How has Wellbutrin help you?,"I (F) think Wellbutrin only help with my executive function issues and the subsequent depression it caused, common complaints in women with ADHD. I don't think it has helped with my attention span at all. I gave up on reading due to what you described BUT on the other hand, audio books combined with another activity are helpful. I don't even have the attention span to sit and listen, but if I combine it with a physical activity like cleaning, I retain the information."
How has Wellbutrin help you?,"it mainly just keeps my mood and stimulation stable, but vyvanse is really the med that does wonders, wellbutrin more so works in the background"
How has Wellbutrin help you?,"I was on Wellbutrin for ‚Äútreatment resistant depression"" before I was diagnosed with ADHD. It was the first medication to ever help me. It helped with my emotional dysregulation and lack of energy/ motivation. That being said, it only helped maybe like 30%? Not enough to actually function, but enough to make my therapist at the time realize that maybe anxiety/ depression wasn‚Äôt what I was dealing with, but ADHD."
How has Wellbutrin help you?,"None of the above. Just my mood is better... in combination with Medikinet Mr, I am more motivated and feel less tired, but focus is still a big issue.
I've only been on medication for the last 2-3 months, and I think is getting better and better."
How has Wellbutrin help you?,I'm on 300mg of Wellbutrin and 30mg XR of Adderall. I was thinking of playing a video game called Death Stranding and listening to an audio book or YouTube video while playing it. I have noticed I have more energy while on wellbutrin vs adderall alone. I haven't really tested it out while gaming though.
How has Wellbutrin help you?,"I am on Wellbutrin XL 300 mg and Foquest 55 mg.
Wellbutrin lifts my mood a lot, my emotions are stable, and I have energy (or sometimes I am not tired a lot), which is a big help for me.

Foquest, on the other hand, gives me that focus mode, so I don't think about three things at the same time.

I think it works great when you combine it with stimulant.  Especially if you have depression symptoms too."
How has Wellbutrin help you?,It didn't. All it did was give me tremors and tinnitus. I didn't even make it a month and had to stop.
How has Wellbutrin help you?,Wellbutrin helps my meds last a little longer and keeps me at a baseline
How has Wellbutrin help you?,"I'm not currently on Wellbutrin, my dr asked me to stop while we tried ritalin, I may ask to go back on. 

However, I think it made my lows not as low. It also helped my quit smoking. I was slightly less irritable?"
How has Wellbutrin help you?,"Yes, but for me it works better with a nonstim. I do have a stim, but it's not often in stock. lol."
How has Wellbutrin help you?,"i‚Äôm on 150mg XL and honestly it changed my life so much for the better. i am able to stay awake and alert throughout the whole day, and no longer needed to drink any caffeine. i used to drink at least 1 celsius a day, and it caused me to have heart palpitations. my sleep also got a lot better, and i no longer woke up several times in the night. i recently started concerta and the combo has really helped me be able to focus. i originally was put on wellbutrin after terrible experiences with SSRIs and the fact that my psychiatrist had an inkling that i had ADHD, but i wasn‚Äôt formally diagnosed yet."
How has Wellbutrin help you?,"My mood improved somewhat as I was less angry and irritable but that's it. Didn't help with motivation, concentration or negative thoughts. It's stopped working for me though."
How has Wellbutrin help you?,"Wellbutrin 300mg has been a silver bullet for me in emotional regulation. 

I was getting to the point where every day I would wake up and not know what kind of person I was going to get. I might feel fine or slightly elevated while other days I would be on a knife's edge of irritability. I would find myself getting extremely frustrated and annoyed in conversations for no good reason, it would just rapidly escalate in me. 

Been on the medicine a few months now and I feel like an entirely different person. It hasn't ""numbed"" me at all, it's just made me more consistent. I wake up the same every day now and feel very even. I experience normal ups and downs but they never feel out of control or artificial. I'm better able to regulate my emotions and as such properly engage in the world around me.

What is *hasn't* done is a lick for executive function. I still deeply struggle with ADHD and procrastination and the like. I started generic Ritalin last week (10mg) and haven't felt anything with that. Doctor suggested I go up to 20mg starting tomorrow so we will see."
How has Wellbutrin help you?,"Audiobooks are good, but I like learning new words, it just sucks because I can‚Äôt get past the first page without wandering off in my head or rereading it multiple times.

How has Wellbutrin help you?,thank you that being said i get tired off them after like 2-3 hours of them kicking in so i have to workout or do something very physical during or soon after that time frame or i‚Äôll be too tired or relaxed haha. been feeling really lazy lately from that and not doing anything about it
How has Wellbutrin help you?,Gosh so much better !! Stimulants saved my life <3
How has Wellbutrin help you?,No not anymore ! That plus my stimulants gave me tachycardia
How has Wellbutrin help you?,"Is the same as Ritalin, Concerta etc. That should help with focus, but haven't seen a difference, people still complain I don't listen. üòÖ"
How has Wellbutrin help you?,"Meeting with my doc tomorrow and we'll probably try something else.¬† I'm told the other antidepressants don't play well with stimulants though, which I think I need. I think if I could get on a stimulant and get shit done my depression will take care of itself."
How has Wellbutrin help you?,"Awe, hopefully you find something that works for you :)"
How has Wellbutrin help you?,Maybe talk to your doctor if it‚Äôs been a while
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,Definitely call your doctor ASAP.
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"Thank you for all the kind responses! You guys rock!

I called my docs office, they told me to at least power through to next week and see if there are any improvements.

Just never thought anti-depressants could make me feel this way... fuck."
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"I'd call your doc for sure. When I started treating my ADHD some of my other symptoms/issues cleared up and the severity of my depression set in.  I have a combo of stims and SNRI's to help keep me level and functioning.  There are lots of med options/combos so if you feel this poorly off the hop, I'd ask if there is something else to work with."
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,Wellbutrin does take time but also if it feels THIS BAD - please tell your doctor. New meds should not increase the bad feelings.
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,Two to four weeks to feel effects
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,I responded very poorly to Wellbutrin. I also became very anxious.
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"Call your doctor ASAP. Wellbutrin just might not work well for you, especially if the side effects are extra shitty. They usually dissipate after 1-2 weeks.

Also, meds come with informational pamphlets. If that‚Äôs not convenient, you can Google it and find its uses and side effects on the internets. All meds have side effects, they‚Äôre different for everyone.

Reiterating, call your doctor ASAP so y‚Äôall can determine if you‚Äôre having serotonin syndrome or just shitty side effects, and also so you can maybe switch to something different if you guys decide Wellbutrin isn‚Äôt good.

Also, if you‚Äôre not seeing a psychiatrist (or a mental health professional/specialist), and you‚Äôre seeing your general practitioner, etc, I highly recommend looking into it at your first opportunity."
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"I‚Äôd call your doctor, but if they didn‚Äôt warn you of the possible side effects and how to recognize them, you might want to look for a new doctor. That‚Äôs really unsafe! I haven‚Äôt taken Wellbutrin, but I know that these symptoms aren‚Äôt normal, and need to be addressed before they get worse!
Just remember this isn‚Äôt you, the feelings can come and go, and you don‚Äôt have to act on them. If you feel that you‚Äôre having unsafe thoughts, reach out to someone immediately. üíú"
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"I‚Äôm a month in and just switched to SR from the XL, which is 100 mg twice a day. I can confirm the first two weeks absolutely sucked. My biggest issue now is the excessive sweating as a side effect. I‚Äôve made huge progress and decided to go another 30 days to see if my body finally catches up the increase in energy. I‚Äôm also on 10mg lexapro, so I knew what to expect going in taking a daily med like this that takes time to adjust to. 
All said and done, if it‚Äôs too much, please do call the doc. I live with my GF and she‚Äôs been a huge help in leveling me out."
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,I started wellbutrin a year and a half ago and I would say it took about 2 weeks for me to fully start to feel effects.
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"During the first two weeks there are initial side effects, which are normal. This includes psychological side effects. If the side effects are particularly severe or don't stop after the first two weeks, then I would see a doctor."
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"I felt very shitty and not like myself. I consulted a doctor and quit. I felt better literally the next day. It seemed a bit weird to me that I was prescribed something with these weird potential side effects for ADHD. I really was not depressed when I started, and became depressed because of this shit.  

Some people say it became good after a few weeks, for me, it was not worth it."
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"Wellbutrin was living hell for me. Made a post last week on my experience - I was prescribed it for ADHD, but I hade NO idea why antidepressants are becoming an ADHD treatment method. 

Every day was worse than the last. I felt like I could break down and cry at the drop of a pin,  and was starting to feel like I'd genuinely lost myself; like I didn't know who I was anymore. It was honestly traumatic and I stopped seeing the doctor who was pressing it on me (yes, pressing. Not hearing me out, but pressing me to keep taking it.) 

Glad to see in the comments that you've contacted your doctor, be MORE than honest with them, and if you're anything like me, you'll be far better without ""WELL""-butrin."
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,Are you taking any other medications too which may be causing the side effects? Or do you smoke? The advice to speak to doctor seems sound.
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"hi! with antidepressants many people feel worse before they get better. it‚Äôs really common. hang in there, we‚Äôre all rooting for you ü§ç"
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,Call your doctor. Ask if there‚Äôs a different medication that might help more positively.
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,Please call your doctor.  These don‚Äôt sound like the typical side effects that you just have to ‚Äúget through‚Äù. I tired Wellbutrin for about 4 months and it just want a good fit for me.
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,Call your doctor.  Have you ever been diagnosed with bipolar disorder? BD2 and ADHD are usually comorbid.
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,Wellbutrin barely had any effect on me besides completely RANDOM panic attacks which I had never experienced before
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"It looks like you‚Äôve already gotten and responded to tons of great advice, but I wanted to add my voice to the chorus and say keep your doctor totally completely in the loop (!!!) and give it time.  Wellbutrin has deff helped my depression but the first week or so was weird.  But it can also cause things like suicidal tendencies if it‚Äôs not right for you long-term, so please keep your doctor appraised, stay safe, and take care do yourself! 

Also, mental health  is real health. If you are in the position to take a few sick days or even just tell your boss that you might be a little low energy or not feeling great because of a medication change, do that!  I used to be so driven not to take sick days and to push through things if I possibly could and  recently I realize all I‚Äôm doing is helping my employer make more $$ at the expense of my own health."
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"I think everyone handles these things differently. For me it just works. No side effects. It just does what it‚Äôs supposed to and I don‚Äôt even notice!

I‚Äôd say call the doc. It‚Äôs throwing you out of balance it seems"
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"I felt the same the first week or two taking it, very depressed with some suicidal thoughts, and then the effects started to settle. Since starting the medication months ago, my emotions are the most regular it has ever been my entire life. Its an amazing feeling to be honest!"
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"Hey I just started Wellbutrin I think almost a month ago, I feel like I just came out of a big ‚Äúrelapse‚Äù I‚Äôm pretty sure it can get worse before it gets better and full effects are supposed to take after like a month or two, of course talk to your doctor about what your feeling. Be patient with yourself, and just know it will get better, if you need someone to chat with Im here ü§òüèº"
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"I had this problem trying Wellbutrin the first time. I believe the issue was trying to jump into too high of a dosage (150mg) and then upping that dosage too fast (300mg). I quit after a week because the side effects were bad, but tried it again after my insurance wouldn't cover Strattera. The second time, I started with 100mg, then 200mg, then 300 and it was still a bit unpleasant for a few days every time I upped the dosage but much better than the first time around. I also cut out caffeine because it was making anxiety and restlessness worse. 

If you're already on day 6, you're probably pretty close to leveling out on that dosage, meaning the side effects should soon diminish. If it were me, I'd stick it out. I would also ask your doctor if you can increase dosage slowly if they want you on 300mg eventually. Expect to feel a little shitty for a few days every time you up the dosage. Moderate exercise, eating breakfast before taking it in the morning, and LOTS of water helped with the stimulation, irritability, sleep issues, and nausea/dizziness.

Once you're on the full dose and side effects subside, it still takes a few weeks to really notice the benefits. To me they were subtle but they're still holding almost a year later, and other people in my life noticed improvement even when I didn't. 

When I take it now I feel absolutely nothing, no side effects, no stimulation, no euphoria, etc. It's just maintenance. It does get better. Most of the horror stories you hear on here are from people who took it for a week or two, only experienced the side effects, and then quit before seeing any benefit.

That being said, if after a few weeks it's still causing problems, talk to your doctor for sure, it might not be right for you."
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"Talk to your doctor ASAP! I've tried many antidepressants, one was Wellbutrin and I could only stand it for 3 weeks. I became so depressed, apathetic and dissociated. While it did help me stop smoking cigarettes really quickly, it was not the antidepressant for me! 
Don't give up though! Sometimes it takes some trial and error until you find the right medication!"
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,It's normal its side effects they come and they go if after 1 weeks it's continues then go see your doctor side effects can last up to 1 week or more I've taking alot of antidepressants and I know it's hard the first week or 2 but things should get better if not well it's not for you .
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"this is so similar to my exact experience.

I was irritable the first day, then on days 2-5, I noticed an increase in focus with just a mild side effect of anxiety.

Then, the next 2 weeks, I went into a depression so severe I couldn‚Äôt go to work. I didn‚Äôt think it was caused by wellbutrin but it certainly didn‚Äôt help.

but when i told my psychiatrist, he said, ‚Äúwell you don‚Äôt seem to be responding to therapy or medication (this was only the 2nd anti-depressant he prescribed, and the only stimulant i‚Äôve ever been prescribed in my life), i suggest you go to an out patient hospital‚Äù

he just dropped me as a patient and didn‚Äôt schedule a follow up at all.

so i don‚Äôt know if this is normal because my doctor didn‚Äôt confirm anything or suggest a change in dosage? but please do tell your doctor asap."
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"Most anti-depressants carry the risk of worsening depressive symptoms. It's up to you to decide if it isn't for you, bupropion doesn't work for everybody.

Have a chat with your prescriber or pharmacist about what you're experiencing and hopefully they can get you on a better dosage or medication for your needs."
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,Wellbutrin is known to make depression worse and cause suicidal ideation in ‚Äúyoung adults‚Äù. - I was out of the age range but had those issues and had to get right off it
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"Definitely call your doctor, keep in mind it could be the dosage and your own metabolism. I initially started Wellbutrin at 300mg (3 100mg instant release tabs per day, six hours apart) and when they swapped me to an extended release formula, is basically did nothing. I could feel when it wore off, and I was right back to how I was before. I'd say for me it took about a month to fully get used to the med, but I was kind of mentally out of it a few days. I would definitely ask about the dosage, but increasing the dosage in your case really might not be the best idea, but you could maybe do instant release once a day and see if that has a different effect. It's technically less than the extended release and you will probably feel when it wears off a bit, but when I was on the extended release, I would feel it wear off hours before it was supposed to, which was coincidentally the same time I was supposed to take my old dose the second time that day. Wellbutrin might just also not be the right med for you, and even what I've experienced might not correlate to you and how your body is reacting"
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"I‚Äôm on it too! I was low for 3 weeks but now so so so much better. I made sure to surround myself with stuff like dinner with friends, planning to go to the gym, being extra extra nice to myself. 
I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre going through it. Stay safe love!"
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"i was on wellbutrin, a side effect is anxiety, and irritability is not uncommon but not directly related. for me i had to wait the full 2 weeks and i worked perfectly well. there were definitely hiccups while on it as anxiety can casue a lot of issues but i did become more functional overall. one thing to recognize is that it works similarly to a stimulant, so it can have some of the same draw backs. you may focus better or worse depending on how attentive you were before being on it, and other factors can also detract from your ability to focus like general interest in the task or lack of a deadline.

i would be cautious, as you seem to be having a harder time on it which may mean many things. speak with your doctor over the specifics if possible, and do not just suddenly stop taking the meds. i was told i could stop cold turkey but that is a lie. antidepressants can take from 4 months at the least to clear out depressive symptoms, sooner and they will come back. wellbutrin does have withdrawls and when coming off mine i got sick for 3 days similar to a cold, i took it very slow even, but i went from 300mg to 150, so there was more room for error.

one thing i would take to note though, wellbutrin is completely ineffective on OCD, and while its rare to have both adhd and ocd, its not impossible, and you could actually have ocd instead of adhd. this could make symptoms worse. ask all the questions you can to your doctor, you may actually need an SSRI if wellbutrin doesnt work for you. meds arent exact, its a process and could take multiple medications or diagnosis. medication is only necessary because of how demanding day to day lives are today. if you can add very light exercise at the very least, youd be doing yourself a lot more than youd think."
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,I got put on wellbutrin for a while but when I went back to my primary dr she took me off it immediately because of seizure risk among other risk factors i don't remember that one just sticks. Id change medications especially  if it's not working for you anyways. It can take a few tries before you find what works for you.
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"I think your thread and follow up is the only thing that helped snap me out of a really, really bad side effect. I am on day 14 and this gives me hope. I wish my provider would get back to me."
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"For me 300mg felt better than 150mg, noticably so. Try 300mg, it's the ""standard"" dose. 150mg / day not really common. If 300mg doesn't work, then maybe it's not right for you. Though I have heard of people taking 450mg for an effect. But definintely, 300mg. There's a huge difference. On 150mg I feel like not doing anything"
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"It definitely takes time to adjust to it and you may need to adjust the dosage as well, as others have suggested. Are you talking with your prescriber about what you are experiencing?"
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"Wellbutrin could worsen anxiety, that might be the reason. I thought stimulants were first line for ADHD, not sure why they gave you Bupropion."
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,It didn‚Äôt work for me. I‚Äôm on cipralex and adderall now. Much better
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"I take welbutrin and it took a few tries of different dosage and immediate vs extended release. The rage and anger faded after 2 weeks and I definitely like it a lot now. I take it with Zoloft and that seems to be a cocktail that works for me. Good luck, most psychs will want you to take it for 4-6 weeks to give it time before switching around"
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"Hang in there bud, this is the same reaction I had. Those 2 weeks make a world of difference. If you still feel this way after everything is settled talk to your doctor about a dose increase."
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,I pretty much completely ignore how meds make me feel for the first two weeks. it can take up to two months for your body to get used to medication so just power through and if you still feel this way in a week it‚Äôs probably concerning
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"I was on Wellbutrin XL 150mg for a month, and I didn't feel anything (in fact I had really intrusive and awful thoughts and nearly had a breakdown) on it, besides tinnitus. I told my therapist and she switched me to Sertraline 50 mg and Lamotrigin 50 mg daily. I feel more stable and it has only passed a week."
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"Wellbutrin made me terribly nauseous the first two weeks. It was awful. (Thankfully didn't worsen my depression.) 

But once it evened out, I felt good on it. Been on it a few years now with no issues. Hope it goes well for you in the long term!"
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"I literally just went through this, although I'm taking it for anxiety. I do have a history of depression though. In the beginning, the anxiety and resulting anger was overwhelming, and it had already been overwhelming before I started. I'm still exhausted. I saw one of your other comments saying that your dr told you to power through, otherwise I'd tell you to contact them.

It did get better for me after about 2 weeks. I felt calm for the first time in my life. It only lasted a few hours, but my overall anxiety is a bit better. I'm talking to my doctor on Friday about next steps.

You're not alone. Finding a good medication can be so hard and scary. Remember that what you're feeling is temporary and likely isn't a true reflection of your reality, and you CAN stop taking the medication later when things settle. This is not permanent and can be reversed if you need to."
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"It can get your brain back up to a higher speed,  but the old content is still there. Pretty common with any antidepressant and usually passes within three weeks- it's not permanent."
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,Wellbutrin is awesome for me. Sorry you are struggling!!
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"For what its worth, I had a pretty good experience, but it also fluctuated in the early days, before it settled in.

My personal observation would be:

- caffeine and alcohol are very bad with this one. They make me feel exactly how you put it: anxious, angry and not right. If you've been drinking either while taking Wellbutrin, I'd strongly recommend you try going completely without. I haven't tried smoking but since its also a stimulant and Wellbutrin is actually also to help quit smoking, I would suspect it can have a similar negative interaction.
- for me its also sensitive to fluctuations in the time I take the pill. Ideally everyday in a 1 or 2h window. I had a week in which I took them at really irregular hours and that week I felt noticeably more depressed and unstable until I re-established taking it at the same time each morning."
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,I definitely felt low emotionally for the first few days but for you it sounds like you should call your doctor asap and let them know.
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"so i just started wellbutrin xr 150mg,

and i haven't felt anything yet,

I do still have insane bouts of ADHD (look, I'm on Reddit at 5pm when I have work I had to finish before EOD, now im making my family wait, oof)

But I was told I wouldn't feel the effects of it for 2-3 weeks.

It isint a stim that instant boosts you, it builds up a damn such that when you do get dopamine hits normally throughout the day, that it will stay with you, allowing to to not get distracted etc,

I think long term, it paired with a stim may be what I need personally, but time will tell. I'm giving it 4 weeks, 2 to start, 3 to fully see effects, and eager for weeks 3 to 4 to see what I feel like then."
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,Sounds like it‚Äôs not the right meds for you; follow up with your doc and try something else!
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"I was also told it takes two weeks to see fully how it will affect you; especially for ppl with anxiety and ADD, it can address those too but like all psych meds, it won‚Äôt be the same for everyone and can have opposite effects. This one works with dopamine and norepinephrine primarily and it takes two weeks for the amount of dopamine to build up in your brain, according to my doctor"

Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"I had a similar reaction to you. I‚Äôm now on concerta, which should technically be more anxiety-causing, but it is not for me personally.

Just a reminder to trust your own sense of your own body. For what it‚Äôs worth, I did and I don‚Äôt regret it. 

Our biochemistries and the programming on top of them are all unique, if similar, and it‚Äôs worth exploring what works for them and discarding what doesn‚Äôt when you‚Äôre this confident that it doesn‚Äôt."

I‚Äôve been on prozac but i had mild side effects after a few months and my doc switched medication for me too.  It‚Äôs for your *mental health*, if the meds are making you feel like you have to ‚Äúdeal‚Äù with it, it‚Äôs time to try another."

Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"Unfortunately, it can take a couple of weeks.

On Vyvanse I felt some of the same but it's been two weeks now and it's finally starting to feel really good. Lots of negative thoughts went through my head, or I always had them I just couldn't hear them clearly. Going trough all that and just feeling the feelings was some of the toughest shit I've ever done. But now it's starting to pay off."

But it‚Äôs strange, I‚Äôll have a good random day sometimes but mostly anxious depressed days. Are you still a fan of the Wellbutrin?"
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"It took about 4 weeks for the horrible anxiety and irritability to subside and the therapeutic effects to stabilize. However, the loss of appetite stuck around for the nearly 2 years I was on Wellbutrin and had to stop taking it as I was barely eating, which was worsening my mood."
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,I‚Äôm going thru this right now. Just started about 5 days ago. Feeling very sad. But this also happened to my mom and after a few weeks she got better

Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"It's ridiculously ironic that ""antidepressants"" can actually GIVE people depression. I had never identified as someone with depression, but Wellbutrin introduced me to what depression is. 

Nothing's perfect, but my life's been peaches & cream in comparison to when I was on wellbutrin (only on Vyvanse now)."
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,They ended up putting me on a low dose of Zoloft to counteract the depression and anxiety that Wellbutrin was causing. Too bad neither help with my ADHD ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"Are you taking other meds? maybe they're interacting.

Also, antidepressants are the type of meds that really take a while to get into your system and level out - so it is possible your body is having a weird transition period and it will take another week or so to reach a balance, which is prolly why your doc wants to wait and see.

Have some other supports ready - reach out to folks, if you have a therapist maybe schedule an extra/earlier appointment, practice your self-care and take breaks from working if you need to. Taking care of the mind and taking care of your body are one in the same."
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,I'm surprised they told you to go another week... did you tell them you felt like you wanted to quit your job?
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,I was going to say give it another week. I really hated the side effects of Wellbutrin when I took it for depression in the 90s for the first two or three weeks (it made me super jittery and the insomnia was bad too). But after that third week or so it was like a miracle drug for me.
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"I tried Wellbutrin for ADHD and stayed on it just two days (I'm pretty easily weirded out by meds). It made me feel depressed, too. I'm not qualified to recommend anything in your particular case, but I recently tried a low dose of Adderall (despite also having anxiety) instead, and it's a good fit and helping in all the ways I hoped Wellbutrin would."
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"Just checking in on you to see how you are doing! 

Antidepressants can be great things, but they also come with serious risks. I'm so sorry you are dealing with such significant side effects. I'm honestly surprised your doctors office suggested you continue considering how severe the depressive side effects are for you so far.  Please remember you know yourself best and if you don't feel safe continuing you can call them and tell them you are concerned for your safety with how severe the meds are making your depression. It honestly seems like they are not recognizing the seriousness of the possible depressive/suicidal side effects since they never even warned you and now asked you to power through another week with no other advice or a safety plan. 

Here is a website that talks in detail about the side effects of wellbutrin from psych central. 

[link](https://psychcentral.com/drugs/wellbutrin-side-effects#side-effects-up-close)

As a side note wellbutrin has a box warning about it causing suicidal thoughts or behaviors.  No need to panic but you are 100% correct in being concerned and it is important to have a plan in place. 

Setting up a safety plan yourself now is a good idea because the depressive thoughts and feeling you have can change to be suicidal, and that change can happen fast when Rx induced. Do you have a friend you trust that you could explain you are having a medication side effect that brings with it a risk of temporary social thoughts?  You'd just ask for them to check in with you about how things are going every couple days.  You'd also ask them to be available to help if it becomes an emergency. 

Another part of the plan could be to call your doctors office back and ask what their after hours emergency number is and what they want you to do in case the severe depressive feelings become imminently suicidal thoughts.  If they are less than helpful call your pharmacy and ask to talk to the pharmacist. Explain what is going on and ask what resources they recommend you have on your safety plan.

I hope you are doing OK and I'm sorry this was not explained to you properly before you started. The doctors office and pharmacy really messed up honestly."

Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"I also had wellbutrin take me through a shit of a ride the first few weeks. I honestly felt like shit most of the time, if not tired and unmotivated then just low/sad and on my worst days it felt like I could fucking breakdown if a breeze hit me the wrong way. It wasn't fun. But it did settle down after those first few weeks, and I felt more motivated and calm. The only thing now is that I think I might have to up the dose because I'm not really sure it's working as well anymore? I try to shut down my suicidal ideation and most of the time i can do it, but recently it's been harder, but idk if that's just because life is stressing me out or because the drug is loosing it's effectsü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I am happy most of the time, but those lows hit me seemingly out of no where, and when I get out of them I don't understand why I felt that bad in the first place."
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,Yes! Call your doc but understand that sometimes people respond poorly to some antidepressants and can make their symptoms WORSE! They are not all the same. If you are feeling like this call your doc to discontinue and try something else!
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"Quite literally the same experience as me. I have no idea why antidepressants are even a consideration in ADHD treatment.

 Like you, I'd never identified with symptoms of depression, but Wellbutrin took me on a walk through the Depression Park.

Fuck that shit. I believe in everyone's brain responding to drugs differently, but it's hard to believe anything good can come from that medication in my experience."
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"Smoking.. yes. Feels like the only thing keeping me above water, right now."
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,I wouldn't jump to that thought just based on the side effects from wellbutrin.  Severe depression/suicidal thoughts and behaviors is a well known serious side effect caused by wellbutrin.  There is a box warning for wellbutrin from the FDA because it was shown to cause this issue in rare instances.  They did not find any other contributing drug interaction or comorbidities that increased this risk except for being a child through young adult.  The risk was so high in adolescents that it is no longer supposed to be prescribed to anyone under 18.

Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"That's great to hear! Thank you so much!
At this point I'm doing way better, than before I took the medicine. It was really, really rough, but ultimately worth it.

Stay tough and hang in there. You will begin to feel the effects any day now. Although, getting in touch with your provider is still a smart idea.

You will be better!"
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"This is not good advice. It may be true that 300 is the target dosage that will help, but jumping too quickly to that **especially without a doctor telling you to** is likely to dramatically increase side effects at best, and dangerous at worst. Wellbutrin lowers the seizure threshold as well, which is why it is VERY rare that a person takes more than 300mg (and also why you're not supposed to drink alcohol regularly while taking it). The risk of going above 300mg usually outweighs the benefit. Don't make any changes before consulting your doc."
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,That is good to hear 300mg is the standard dose. I have been doing that for 2 months and I was worried it might be too much because I‚Äôm easily agitated now
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,I started the medication while travelling and am 16 days in. Your completely right about the alcohol and caffeine. Feel like I'm spiralling but can't talk to a doctor about it till I'm back in 12 days. Feeling pretty scared
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"I did an edit, if you feel like reading it. But here is the TLDR: Wanted to quit. Decided to stick with it. It paid off. I'm really a lot better now."
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"Last Edit was about 2 weeks ago.

I'm still taking it and Iove the effects on my overall mental well being. But I also lost one of my best friends a week ago in a car crash.

So I'm not doing perfectly fine. It did, however, make this loss somewhat easier to handle.

Thinking about it still hurts, though. She was an amazing ADHD person.

Sorry.. Got sidetracked... I'd say that if you're still experiencing side-effects after 2 weeks, or if the side-effects are severe enough before then, you need to contact a medical professional.

Because my experience is just that. My experience.

Take care! Big hugs!"

Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"Thank you! Seriously!

I'm okay. I'm not doing bad. I'm not doing good. I'm in the middle, pretty much.

Because of the lack of communication there is a good chance I'll lose my job now. So I'm not happy at all at the moment. I never wanted anti-depressants in the first place. I still have a health check appointment to determine if I could be given amphetamines, which is what I really wanted.

So I might just quit Wellbutrin anyways.  I just don't feel like I'm in good, or at least, competent hands, and who could blame me? At this point, I'm pretty sure that the safest hands are still my own. No wonder I never asked for help before.

But I want to try and see if it does work as well. I'm just afraid that it will fuck me up worse, if I quit in a few weeks from now.

Feels like I can't even ask anyone ""professional"" what my best call is, since I don't trust them anymore."
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"Do not ever recommend anyone just stop taking antidepressants. They are not like stimulants where you can just take them as needed - they are absorbed and released by the body slowly and require a constant dosage and adjustment period to work properly. 

Unexpected stuff can happen if you just stop taking them suddenly. Side effects can get worse. You can be unstable for a while. You've gotta be in a touch with a doctor before changing anything like that."

Wellbutrin's seizure threshold becomes problematic at around 650mg + per day. At dosages of 450mg or less, IIRC it is less seizure-inducing than classical SSRIs. Can't remember the data.   


300mg after weeks on it is fine"

Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"Is possible, but a well known side effect of wellbutrin are suicidal thoughts and behaviors.  The risk is high enough that the FDA put a box warning on wellbutrin because of that.  The bad warning is supposed to mean that the doctors office and the pharmacy is to clearly explain the depressive/suicidal risks and help with a safety plan before it is prescribed or dispensed.  It also means they determined wellbutrin causes these feelings and behaviors on its own and it is not due to interactions. 

I used to work in emergency services and this is a rare but very serious side effect. I responded to people in crisis from taking wellbutrin on several occasions and the change is quick and had for people to plan for in order to be safe.  It's very sad to see people not being warned about it because that increases the risk of the suicidal behavior being ""successful""."
Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"I competed understand your loss of trust, it is very reasonable. With your job it might be worth looking to see if you can apply for FMLA.  Typically in an emergent situation (which serious medication side effects are) you can apply after the fact.  It will protect you from losing your job since this was our of your control. It is a US specific law, but there are similar ones in other countries also. 



This is a [link](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla/forms) to the governed forms in case you are in the US. Some of the requirements are that your employer/ entire company has 50 or more employees and you have been working there 12 or more months.  When you talk to your boss or HR tell them you want the forms to apply for FMLA. You should also talk to your doctor and have them write a note to go along with it.  If your doctor pushed back at all be firm and tell them how serious the effects were.  That it wasn't just you being a little off, that you literally could not get out of bed and elaborate a little if you feel it is needed.  This would also be a good time to tell them you have looked at the FDA box warning and are very upset they didn't properly warn you and were not helpful when you called in very concerned.  Tell them that treatment has damaged your trust with them as a provider and the last they can do is to write you a note to help you keep your job when their lack of action is the source of the problem. 

Not trying to be bossy, but I'm pretty angry at the treatment you received.  It's completely OK and appropriate to express those feelings and concerns to the providers. 

But I'm really glad to hear your are doing OK.  Just be excessive mindful how you are feeling with the extra stress the trouble with your work is adding."

Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"Antidepressants are what got me and many folks over in the bipolar sub diagnosed. They all - Wellbutrin and atypicals too - caused mood swings or worsening depression.

Even with my reactions to antidepressants it still took ten years to get a diagnosis and I‚Äôd be remiss if I didn‚Äôt say one should have Bipolar on their radar after such a reaction.

As read, it sounded like you were advising them to just take 300mg without consulting anyone. You also don't know this person's age or weight. Dosage is different for adolescents than for adults, and for lighter vs heavier people. 

300mg is the typical dose, but you are right that up to 450 is sometimes used for people who do not respond to 300. Above 450 the likelihood of seizures increases tenfold. That's a direct quote from several drug fact sites.

Always consult with a doctor before making changes to your medication regiment. They can not predict side effects, but they have more info about your specific case than a random person on the internet."

Isn't Wellbutrin supposed to make me less depressed?,"Oh yeah it‚Äôs very possible to not respond to wellbutrin without other external factors, I was just offering a possible clue as to why they might be doing poorly.

Can you cite a source? 

All nice. But it is still an off label drug for ADHD, most people I know say it helped depression bug not ADHD, and I was not depressed.  Also, I fell like when you go to a psych they just see only the ""disorder"" and they just give you a drug to see if it works and do not ask you if maybe have a month to just lay in bed. When I was trying this shitty drug, I was not in a moment in my life when I could take a few weeks off to doubt my whole  life. And I do not know yet, but it might have had a disastrous effect on my life since I was doing important job interviews ( so like doing things that can actually make my circumstances easier and better) 

 And this is the annoying thing. Not the existence of Wellbutrin, but the fact that nobody asks you or informs you. And it is not so easy to link a sudden depression to a drug. I know it is written on the box or whatever. It is still not obvious. When you have a nausea, you think oh.. maybe it is a side effect of a pill-when you fell depressed you think-my life makes no sense this is why I am depressed...."

I tried to explain to them that I was misdiagnosed previously. Put on medication that made me light-headed constantly and feint sometimes. I wound up getting a bp monitor that showed the medication made my bp like 80/50.

Anyway, my psychiatrist had the same position as yours. And i had to continually advocate for myself for about 6 months before she finally gave in. I still had to get a battery of heart tests that showed my heart is great. And I'm finally on adderal like 10 months after my diagnosis.

I think they are biased towards believing I was hypertensive because I'm 6'3"" and in the 250's. But I exercise a lot and eat very well. Cholesterol is 120.

"Just got prescribed Wellbutrin for the first time, I‚Äôm nervous, what should I expect?","Mine was the other way around. I started on Wellbutrin and then added the Adderall. Started at 10 then to 20 and ended up on 30 milligrams of Adderall XR I honestly felt That it started working a little bit about a week or so into it, but it wasn't until she upped my dose to 300 mg that it really flicked the switch on. You probably need to go up to 300. I actually went up to 450 mg, but it worked to my disadvantage because at that dose I started getting brain fog and couldn't sleep. So back down to 300 mg. It was then that they added the Adderall at 10 mg XR and slowly went up to 30 mg. I do have Wellbutrin ir 75 mg that I can take twice a day if I need it. It's basically a booster to work with the Adderall. It's a better alternative in my opinion than going on another stimulant booster. It actually works better IMO than When I tried to add Adderall for a booster. I hope you find a combination that will work for you soon. Good luck."

Wellbutrin when it works,"I started wellbutrin in november last year. For me it helps so much with making the chatterbox in my head shut up. I'm much more relaxed in my head and can actually focus on what i am doing. I can't take stimulants because of other health problems so i am really happy this works. You still have to motivate yourself to do things though it just isn't as hard as without it, for me at least. Switching tasks i can do easier now too, i can do something else between for 5 minutes quick and go straight back to what i was doing. I could never do that before."
Wellbutrin when it works,"I haven‚Äôt tried stimulants, but Wellbutrin was the first antidepressant I took for postpartum depression and anxiety. Having gone off it and back on, I can say it quieted my thoughts and let me live in the present without my mind racing. Also, I didn‚Äôt realize this when I first went on it because I was also actively trying to lose weight and changing my diet, but it‚Äôs definitely an appetite suppressant and possibly metabolism booster for me. I gained 30 lbs in about 3-6 months off it."
Wellbutrin when it works,"Wellbutrin works for me. It helps me not get stuck on bullshit worries and anxiety. 

Room too messy? I clean instead of feeling overwhelmed. 
Someone at work did something wrong? I just talk to them instead of getting angry. 
Don‚Äôt know how to fix something around the house? I just start and think it through while I work. 

I‚Äôm not sure if the Wellbutrin is helping with the ADHD itself, or if it just helps with the anxiety. Whatever it is doing, it helps a lot."

Wellbutrin when it works,"I am really confused about all these meds. When I was reading up it said that it's better to take wellbutrin WITH non-stimulant medications instead of SSRI's. Only afterwards I started seeing that wellbutrin can be used to treat ADHD symptoms on it's own. 

Getting the right medication combo is a MISSION that I was not prepared for."

Wellbutrin when it works,"I got me out of depression, but it never really helped with ADHD symptoms. But then again, nothing did for a longer time, not methylphenidate nor Vyvanse."
Wellbutrin when it works,"This is the only medication that scares the absolute shit out of me when my friends get an RX. When they put me on it, the first few days were pretty good. After that, I started becoming a recluse to the point where if there were more than 3-4 people in a room I had to leave. It completely changed my personality and I am still dealing with social anxiety 10 years later. I'm glad it works for some people, but man that shit is scary af to me."
Wellbutrin when it works,"Wellbutrin worked very well for energy, mood, and motivation, more so than adderall does for me

But it also made me an anxious mess, destroyed my sleep, and did nothing for task focus or enjoyment. It did nothing for my forgetfulness or disorganization. It basically just made me happy, but still with adhd"
Wellbutrin when it works,"Everybody is different but for me, it mainly just about cured my depression symptoms and/or the adhd traits that are similar to depression. For example, my room was an absolute disaster for probably 4 years of my life (not just ‚Äúclothes everywhere‚Äù I mean BAD) I always WANTED to have a clean room but I had zero motivation to actually change it and I got way too stressed out to actually do it. After taking Wellbutrin for about 2 weeks (150 mg) I literally cleaned and rearranged my entire room so much that it wasn‚Äôt even recognizable (in a good way) Thats one thing I notably remember after taking Wellbutrin. It finally didn‚Äôt feel impossible to do certain things that come so easily to others. 

It had also helped a bit with giving me a little bit more energy, as I would constantly be exhausted before. Made me think more positively towards my ADHD/myself which helped me not give up so easily on work or feel so hopeless. I know there are a few other things as well, so I‚Äôll come back and list them as I remember. Overall, everybody is different but Wellbutrin changed me in such a positive way that I highly recommend it for people who have depression OR inattentive adhd (the ‚Äúlazy‚Äù adhd peopleüôÑ lol) ask me anything you‚Äôd like! I hope this works out for you <3"
Wellbutrin when it works,"Wellbutrin helped with my self rumination, a bit with anxiety, and definitely helped adult a little better, but definitely doesn't make me as functional as the stimulant meds."
Wellbutrin when it works,"Wellbutrin worked for me in combination with Adderall!

Individually, Wellbutrin helped to bridge the gap between my motivation and actual doing of the task; Adderall sort of helped to narrow my focus a little bit.

Still trying to find the sweet spot of medications for my ADHD. The Wellbutrin definitely helped more with my depression symptoms than my ADHD symptoms"
Wellbutrin when it works,"So it worked ‚Äúok‚Äù enough during my pregnancy‚Äôs many years ago. But when i tried it again 5 years ago, It caused awful awful anxiety. I don‚Äôt know what changed with me in between my pregnancies and Trying it years later but I went back immediately to adderall."
Wellbutrin when it works,Wellbutrin didn't work for me. I just quit it cold turkey  recently and didn't even have withdrawal after taking 300mg a day for a year.
Wellbutrin when it works,I have taken adderall on and off for almost 20 years. This year I decided I want to get off of it or significantly lower my dose. We added 300 mg of Wellbutrin and I take 15-20 mg of adderall. The Wellbutrin helps bridge the gap when the adderall wears off and I think is a much healthier alternative. I haven‚Äôt had any negative side effects from years of stimulants but in the back of my head I know I can‚Äôt take them forever. Wellbutrin alone would for sure help but as long as I can take my adderall I will.
Wellbutrin when it works,"I guess it helps some people but Wellbutrin is usually in addition to a first line treatment for ADHD, on its own it rarely works well."
Wellbutrin when it works,Yes!! This exactly‚Äî it‚Äôs not an immediate and obvious rush of motivation like stimulants but a gradual one where you all of a sudden realize you‚Äôre focus is improved and you‚Äôre doing stuff without having to push too hard
Wellbutrin when it works,That may be why it‚Äôs an ‚Äúoff-label‚Äù treatment
Wellbutrin when it works,"Yeah, doctors are way too quick in diagnosing depression and anxiety. It‚Äôs kind of disheartening"
Wellbutrin when it works,I find task-switching incredibly hard too. I‚Äôm glad it helped you!
Wellbutrin when it works,the post-Wellbutrin weight gain is as AWFUL
Wellbutrin when it works,"It‚Äôs interesting how to some people WB alleviates anxiety, and to others it GIVES anxiety. I‚Äôm glad it worked for you!"
Wellbutrin when it works,Exactly! We are gonna actively look instead of passively listen.
Wellbutrin when it works,Omg Preach. I was not prepared either. üòµ‚Äçüí´üò¢
Wellbutrin when it works,Oh that sounds awful. Meds really are trial and error
Wellbutrin when it works,I hope eventually you found something that works
Wellbutrin when it works,Shit that sounds terrifying. I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you
Wellbutrin when it works,Oh that sucks. I hope you found something that helps you better!
Wellbutrin when it works,"Thanks for the information! I have inattentive adhd too, and imo it‚Äôs pretty severe (most days i feel only half of me is present). I do hope wellbutrin helps me, as it seems to have the least severe side effects. Mostly i need help with focus though, rather than motivation. I‚Äôll see how it goes <3"
Wellbutrin when it works,I started it for the second time too and my results are different from my previous try. It‚Äôs so weird! Though for me it just doesn‚Äôt suppress my appetite anymore and i don‚Äôt have anxiety as high as i did on my first try.
Wellbutrin when it works,Oh shit!
Wellbutrin when it works,"Thank you, but until now nothing did. That's ok, though, because I got my life mostly in order (at 40 years, lol), just struggling here and there when I get too much on my plate.  
I hope you find something that helps you on your way."
Wellbutrin when it works,"Thank you so much! I'm glad you still managed to get things in order. It's nice to see some of us ""making it"" despite the struggle"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I was on Wellbutrin for a little over a year, just finished tapering off it a few days ago. Honestly‚Ä¶ I felt like it did pretty much nothing. I was severely depressed and hadn‚Äôt realized I had ADHD at the time. It definitely made me more functional (ex: before it, I literally would not stop crying all day every day) but it was my first antidepressant so I just assumed it‚Äôs minimal effect was how they all worked (I knew it wouldn‚Äôt cure my depression). As for my ADHD symptoms, it did absolutely nothing for me. No change in those, if anything they got worse but I doubt Wellbutrin caused the decline. I never got the increased energy my doctor talked about, and it also lowered my libido when it is advertised to ideally not effect your libido. I think all meds just work so so differently with everyone, so it is hard to say whether it would help your ADHD or not, but that is just my experience."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","When I was on it, it was a miracle drug for my depression but it didn't really help my ADHD way too much. 

I also lost weight, which was really good. I just didn't really care about snacks much.

When my doc added Adderall life was pretty good. Best year of my life when I had them both working well. Not in an ""I'm high and everything is amazing"" way. More like I felt like a competent adult who could function in the world. Stopped thinking of myself as a waste of oxygen. It was freeing af."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",Been taking Wellbutrin for a while now. I definitely saw improvement with my anxiety and depression but I didn‚Äôt really feel a difference in my more obvious adhd symptoms until I started Ritalin. Not that Ritalin works for everyone but it did for me.
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I read an article somewhere about ADHD and depression as a comorbidity and that when doctors recognised both but tried to treat the depression first rather than as a comorbidity to the ADHD the patients were FAR FAR WORSE off. They for some reason thought you should be happy first before trying to treat ADHD, very bizarre. I‚Äôm pretty sure they found in most cases treating the depression made the symptoms of both illnesses much more profound, particularly the depression. 

I wanna say this was a study done with two groups where they treated one diagnosis first over the other to see which gave a better treatment. It was pretty clear to me that treating the symptoms of adhd greatly lessened and I think in some cases cured the depression."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",i'm currently on wellbutrin and i'm lowkey discouraged after reading the comments dfjfkf i don't want this to be a waste of time.... tbf it's only been almost a week but still :^(
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Unfortunately gave me pretty bad suicidal ideation. My psychiatrist thinks it‚Äôs because of my PMDD comorbidity, however."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","They prescripved it to me beacuse they were leery of giving me stimulants which work great. Took it for a few years and it never did anything for my ADHD symptoms. It did make me feel mellow and calm. TOO mellow and calm, I blew off very important things like taxes and ended up $80K USD in debt because of it. Only stimulants work for me."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I fucking love it. It requires for me, 210lbs, 45 years old, the maximum amount at 450mg once daily. Below that I‚Äôm not quite awake and alert in the way I want to be. 

Both Wellbutrin and strattera are norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. I loved strattera - it made my blood pressure too high and I didn‚Äôt have consistent insurance. It was a little like being legally high all the time. Wellbutrin feels like a more manageable level of that same mental space.

In both cases, the maintenance of high levels of norepinephrine can make it feel like your nervous system is a little ‚Äòwired‚Äô - for me that‚Äôs an exciting feeling I like. Wellbutrin also has a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, so you get the good mood for free. 

It lowers the retrieval cost for thoughts, and memories. This can help make our thoughts about things more explicit, and that helps for socially adjusting because we get a moment to really see/hear the words we‚Äôre thinking about using before they come out - a last chance edit which is awesome. 

In both cases, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs good to be comfortable in your own brain. Sometimes our brains are horny, or ideate about death, or whatever. So when some people have reported ideation, I think we already do that. This is all about becoming aware of oneself, and I personally think it‚Äôs important to remember that most feelings don‚Äôt require any response, only that they be felt."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I fucking loved it- the only bad side-effect was the dry mouth. It treated my depression and probably masked my ADHD for several years. Unfortunately, I went through some pretty rough shit and without telling my doctor, doubled my dosage (it was that or lie down and die) and it gave me a grand mal seizure. Obviously I can't take it anymore, but it was pretty good while it lasted."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",Takes a little while to build up in your system. Not sure it‚Äôs a main benefit but it helps with ADHD symptoms for me.
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I tried Wellbutrin but it was prescribed for depression. It helped a little bit, I was able to function a bit better but everything else stayed the same. I had really bad compulsive thinking that increased my depression and at the time my Dr didn't realize I had been diagnosed with adhd as a teen. Once I switched to Ritalin it made me realize how much Wellbutrin and the other depression meds barely did anything."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I've had anxiety/depression/social anxiety for years. My doctor put me on Celexa ~20 years ago. I've gotten off it twice, but I've learned I do better on it. I was diagnosed with adhd recently and was scared to try stimulants so my doctor prescribed wellbutrin. At first it helped adhd. But mostly it showed me how depressed I truly was. I'm WAY happier now. I love myself and I love my life. It might take the edge off adhd, but it's not noticeable. Wishing you the best."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","It didn‚Äôt do anything for my ADHD, and I had a brief period in the first week or two where I had mood swings, overwhelming feelings of impending doom, and inconsolable crying. Not trying to scare you out of taking it, because it does help people. Just make sure that someone close to you knows you‚Äôre on it and is ready to support you if needed."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I started on 100mg in October and just went up to 150. While it doesn‚Äôt have the immediate effect of Adderal and other stimulants, it also has none of the awful side effects. Works pretty well so far."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Wellbutrin is the best. 

Yes it helps with anxiety, but also it gives something I'm having a hard time describing. It's like a clarity of mind. My mind doesn't zap around as much. 

Whzn I have to deal about something unpleasant, be it an unpleasant task, thought or conversation, my mind goes into an ""anything but that"" mode and tries to latch onto anything else. That's how I have spent days scrolling social media during work hours, watching meaningless content, especially with Covid and remote working. 

Then wellbutrin came along. Now I'm able to do things that sounded like science fiction just six months ago: pay a bill the day I get it, answer an important and stressful email when I get it, have conversations about my career or the maintenance of my house, do laundry. 

The most incredible thing is happening: laundry mountain is eroding. For the first time in 15 years, I believe it might one day be gone."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Wellbutrin alone made me extremely anxious, it was just terrible. Eventually I was put on a Adderall and a lowish dose of Lexapro. After several months my depression crept back in and we added Wellbutrin. In conjuction with the Lexapro it worked well!"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",[deleted]
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I'm not saying that it is a bad idea to try welbutrin as first step to see if it helps some. But I feel like it is similar to coming to a doctor for help with really bad, constant, debilitating migraines. And your doctor says ""let's try tylenol first"". Like this medication as a small side effect that can be beneficial to your major problem so let's do that instead of medication designed for this purpose.

That being said, most medicated people will tell you that a big part of this whole ordeal is trying different meds until you find what works for you. So who knows, welbutrin could be what works for you

My personal experience with wellbutrin has been uneventful which I would consider to be a good thing. I have been diagnosed with depression and ADHD since I was young but I went a good 5 years after highschool unmedicated. When I decided to get back on meds my doctor mentioned that welbutrin can also help with ADHD and asked if I wanted to try just welbutrin first. I knew that I wanted to focus on my ADHD so we went ahead and did vyvanse as well. So I don't have any experience of welbutrin without other medication.

Many doctors are somewhat hesitant to give stimulants. And I have read stories of other people whose doctors wanted to deal with their anxiety before ADHD and it just didnt work. So much of their anxiety was a symptom of ADHD that unless it was treated then the anxiety wasnt going away."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","From personal experience it seems like it‚Äôs more for depression and anxiety. At the time I took it I didn‚Äôt have my ADHD diagnosis and I was diagnosed with chronic depression. Now looking back I think a lot of the reason I was so depressed as that I was struggling really hard with my ADHD in college. I felt so worthless and everything was hard or boring, school had made me feel that way since like 12 honestly but at that point it was too much to bare. I was prescribed Wellbutrin and I feel like it made it waayyyy worse. I was even harder on myself, I thought about dying all the time. I realized pretty quickly that things were getting worse and stopped taking it but it kinda made me afraid to take other medicine at the time"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I actually just got off of Wellbutrin. Not trying to scare anyone at all with this story because I know Wellbutrin has worked for a lot of people, but this has been my recent personal experience!

I have been on Dexedrine for my adhd for over 6 months and it has worked wonders for my ADHD. I have also been on  clonazepam and that has been great for my anxiety and ocd. Unfortunately I had a lot of traumatic things happen in a short period of time and my depression became extremely serious. I saw no future for myself and just wanted to be with my loved ones who have passed on. 

So then Wellbutrin was added to help with the depression. I was on 150mg lol might be tmi but at first it made my breasts/nipples so incredibly sore, red and irritated for the first week and insomnia. 


I  ended up taking it for a week and then was put up to 300mg, I tried it for almost 2 weeks and as much as it helped my depression, it actually ended up making my anxiety worse. I experienced raised blood pressure(although this can be normal), increased hunger, intense heart palpitations and uncontrollable panic attacks. I began having vision problems, seeing lights when I closed my eyes and severe insomnia. All of this in turn sent me into mood swings, bad headaches and uncontrollable panic attacks unlike I've had before. 

My doctor thinks that I had a hypersensitive or allergic reaction and I'm now off of the medication to see if these bad side effects go away. The major thing that I could not tolerate was the constant muscle and chest pain, it sent me into severe anxious and obsessive thoughts about my heart. I'm thankful the depression has lifted, however all of my other issues have now become more confusing. 

I apologize for the long story as I currently have been pulled off all of my meds until the Wellbutrin is out of my system, so I'm forever on a storytelling tangent üòÖü§™"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Didn‚Äôt help w adhd, at all, honestly made me more manic/scattered. Increased my energy though, and overall mood. But wow does effects wear off quickly. It‚Äôs a great short term, need a boost, kind of thing. For me at least."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",Awful insomnia and ringing in my ears that never completely went away. Only took it for 8 days.
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I'm on Welbutrin for depression and Vyvanse for ADHD. I had the Welbutrun for a week or so before the Vyvanse (damn insurance had to approve it üòí) and felt a difference with the depression, but I've only gotten relief with the adhd since I started Vyvanse. I was on Zoloft first and that tanked my libido, but the Welbutrin has let it back up to normal."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I‚Äôve been on Wellbutrin for about 10 months. I noticed after 8-10 weeks I wasn‚Äôt spiraling down anymore, my thinking is clearer, I can clearly see when my ADHD is in charge and strategize better. BUT I don‚Äôt really have more energy unless I take some form of caffeine and I‚Äôm still procrastinating constantly, not cleaning up, not meeting deadlines etc etc. unfortunately the bupropion has pushed my BP up a bit (I‚Äôm also 60) and am apparently not a candidate for stimulants but I‚Äôd really like to try them because I‚Äôd like to have a few days where I just get s**t done. 
I‚Äôm old enough to know so much of what I‚Äôm procrastinating on I could accomplish in minutes or a half day or so. Sigh. 
Anyway, although I didn‚Äôt consider myself depressed the Wellbutrin has lifted me up, but also just the confirmation of the ADHD diagnosis has stopped a lot of confusion and beating myself up. I can also look back at difficulties in my life and forgive myself now that I know about the ADHD. 
So, maybe discuss with your Dr trying both stimulants and bupropion. Bupropion is a dopamine re-uptake inhibitor so it is relevant to ADHD."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",I just recently got diagnosed but I went on Wellbutrin a year ago for depression related stuff and found it really helped. Killed my sex drive but I stopped crying while I sat at my desk trying to get work done
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Welbutrin more lifted my depression. I wouldn't use it exclusively w/o other adhd meds working with it. It does really help with my depression, does suppress my appetite a bit, but thats pretty mild for a antidepressant"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Taking Wellbutrin, about 2 months (150mg) in it hasn‚Äôt helped with my ADHD at all I honestly feel a bit hyper and less focused on it. It‚Äôs made me feel better depressive wise though."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",I have depression and OCD as well as ADHD and took Welbutrin for a few weeks. It didn‚Äôt help my symptoms at all and gave me bad anxiety.
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I just started Wellbutrin for ppd and I ‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt tell. I know this may be unhelpful, but maybe it‚Äôs doing something, maybe no? I can tell the difference on adderall when it kicks in, and I‚Äôm sensitive enough to ssris that my first cipralex stopped my panic attacks cold. Wellbutrin seems at the least to be a gentler experience.

It‚Äôs easier to come back off of than ssris, according to my psych, so might be worth a try.

Edit: also for adhd because my symptoms suck atm and doc didn‚Äôt want to up my adderall."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Wellbutrin literally saved my life. I was already on Adderall (which worked great for my ADHD) but my depression got super bad due to intense stuff in my life and we added Wellbutrin in. I was on those two together for 2.5 - 3 years, I think, before my doctor and I realized that anxiety, not depression, was the instigator. Now that I had gotten myself out of the terrible situations I was in, I didn't need meds for depression. So switched to an anxiety med.

But when I got put on Wellbutrin, it was a gamechanger. Never had side effect issues, either."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",I love it. I quit adderall because my moods were up and down on it and Wellbutrin helped me stable out. I drink a shitload of coffee and take Wellbutrin and the combo works for me.
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Like a gas pedal. 

So awesome for a month. I did *everything* all the time

Then it turned into anxiety. I always had it since my first memory as a preschooler. My lifetime of existential anxiety went skyward and I stopped. 

It was like the stories of FenFen diet drug‚Ä¶nervous energy. 

I stopped that stuff. 

I got a therapist and learned how to feel my way *straight through* anxiety until it quit biting me. 

I then started Adderall and nothing else. It calms me down so much that I can take on anything in life. And I killed my anxiety monster with ACT style therapy. 

Now I wonder if I could be more productive with Wellbutrin now with my Adderall meds.

But right now I am calm and good. I am not economically rich‚Ä¶but I am slow enough to play with my kid while being present. 

Wellbutrin is my backup get-rich-energy plan.

Last thought‚Äî-take it very slow with psychiatric meds. They evolve and research can‚Äôt cut living skulls open to test real-time. Take it slow. If any med is an improvement, stay there for a while. And if any med makes you feel crazy, either back off the dose or learn how to nurture your body better. I nearly quit my meds until I stopped coffee‚Ä¶it erased all side effects. I am convinced that a LOT of people that quit adhd meds never realized that quitting coffee first could have solved the entire thing."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I‚Äôve tried it a couple of different times; once for smoking and once for depression. I ended up smoking more and almost busting my alcohol sobriety over my aggressive attitude. The other time I turned into a workaholic and was aggressive towards others around the office for being lazy buggers. 

I guess you could say it helped my ADHD / executive function but not in a good way. I took it before I realized I was ADHD and found out recently that I also fit the bill for OCD and other things."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I was prescribed it for a bit because the doctors didn‚Äôt want to jump right to stimulants. For me, it did nothing for my ADHD or my depression, but left me feeling hella sick when there was a scheduling ‚Äùerror‚Äù between the pharmacy and my doctor‚Äôs office that left me without it for 2 months. I decided not to go back onto it after that. If felt like all it did was add more complications and risks of random withdrawals without adding anything beneficial."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Wellbutrin helped me get out of bed in the morning and also kept me awake for HOURS at night while I imagined extremely detailed and upsetting scenarios happening to me and my loved ones. I'm glad I stopped taking it, personally. I don't think it helped much with ADHD, just gave me a little energy and a loooot of anxiety."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I took it for a few days and it made me feel so bad that I decided to get off it immediately. It was very much a feeling of *doom*, like I was going to die and I didn't know why. Not suicidality at all, just straight doom. Hugely unpleasant. It's obviously different for everyone, so you just have to see how it affects you, but if you find that it's making you feel worse instead of better, definitely don't force yourself to stick it out for too long. Some doctors like to really emphasize that meds can take time to hit the right levels in your system for the proper effect, which is true to a point, but it's not worth the suffering when there are almost always other options if you find something is really effecting you negatively."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Did nothing for my ADD. but I haven't had an anxiety attack since I have been on it.  no longer depressed (lots of other thing contributing to that). 

zero side effects, much different than SSRIs.  That's the reason I finally decided to stay on a medication long term for anxiety/depression.  otherwise it's stay on it until symptoms stabilize then stop once you get tired of not having sex."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I was put in Wellbutrin as a first step for my adhd. Surprisingly, it actually worked wonders for my depression as well! 

I‚Äôd personally give it a B- in terms of the benefits I received for ADHD, however everyone is different and it‚Äôs important to keep an open mind. 

That said, it is a stimulant and stimulants can exacerbate anxiety. Didn‚Äôt happen for me, but just keep an eye and make sure other parts of your mental health don‚Äôt suffer to treat the adhd."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I was diagnosed with anxiety a couple years before my ADHD diagnosis at 18 y/o, and was put on wellbutrin for anxiety (ironic because wellbutrin can make anxiety worse sometimes) and I did notice improvement, i felt less anxious on the day to day basis, but it wasn't a complete fix. I think it's all ironic/funny because my psychiatrist at the time (got a new one now) never suspected ADHD, but I feel like my anxiety was just one of the cards my ADHD liked to play. Overall I think it helped my anxiety and helped reveal that ADHD is the main culprit. I currently am on both wellbutrin and adderall, i feel like the welbutrin doesn't do a whole lot for me anymore because my body is used to it- but I haven't had the chance to consider weening off of it yet. Overall, it's a good step to take towards treating anxiety/depression/ADHD, but a baby step at best. It's different for everyone though. Overall, it, unlike most antidepressents, doesn't deal with serotonin and instead norepinephrine and dopamine, which is why it helps with ADHD and certain aspects of anxiety/depression. This is all just my experience and personal research, but I hope it helps. Goodluck figuring out what works for you!!
Edit: so basically I've been on welbutrin for about 4 years and adderall almost 2"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","It was 2 months of hell for me.

Week 1 and 2: Floaty out of body sensation.  Didn't feel like I was the one in control of my physical body

Week 3 and 4: Became agitated/irritated/angry at the smallest things.  Very uncommon for me to be like that.  Nearly lost my job because I could not control not getting angry at small things (not like I was ""violently angry"", just small things noticeably pissed me off)

Week 4 through end of Month 2: Stabilized mood, but mood was ""don't give two shits about anything"".  Felt like my baseline was lethargic.  Also, chronically constipated (to the point of having to take laxatives every day).  Also began craving only candy/sweets.

For reference I am ADHD primarily inattentive with a co-morbidity of Depression."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I started taking Wellbutrin several years before my ADHD diagnosis, when I was still being treated under the assumption that I had anxiety and depression. It was just one of probably a dozen meds I'd tried, and the only one that really worked. Turns out that was because it was the only one treating the real problem.

Still taking it today, along with stimulants. The biggest change that I noticed with Wellbutrin was the increased motivation. I had the energy to actually follow through on things, instead of just feeling tired and listless most of the time. The effects became a bit less dramatic over time, but it's still absolutely been a help for me."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",I was on it this year from March-September and I hated it. The dose was either too low or too high. Highest I was at was 45mg and it turned me into a zombie. I went through a major break up while on it and didn't cry until I stopped taking it a few months later.
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Had wellbutrin for depression, did nothing tho"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I‚Äôm about to titrate down Wellbutrin in favor of Prozac, which worked well enough a long time ago.

After 18-months, I almost feel like Wellbutrin worsened my depression."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",I felt almost nothing from it but then again I refused to stop drinking heavily while on medication so... I'm in Venlafaxine now and it helps with my anxiety but feels like my ADHD is becoming more pronounced due to the improved mood and energy so I'm kind of all over the place. Takes a while to balance your brain and find the right medication unfortunately but it's worth the time
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Its very small positive effect added up to a pretty big difference in overall mood. Less depressive thinking meant I could get out of the hole I was in, but it wasn't like stimulants where my energy and stimulation went up."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Are there any antidepressants which don‚Äôt lower libido?

Coming off SSRI‚Äôs is a biitch.

Wellbutrin not an ssri"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",my psych won't let me try wellbutrin because it can cause weight loss. buttt now i don't want to try it because it sounds terrifying.
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","On it and I honsetly don't find it that effective and I believe it messed with my appetite. It's a lot better than my experience with Lexapro though, as it doesn't leave me constantly exhausted."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I went on Wellbutrin when I maxed out my citalopram dosage and it was a disaster with my anxiety. It brought my moderate simmering anxiety disorder to a full-blown one-setback-away-from-panic-attack constant state of perpetual anxiousness. I went back to the citalopram alone and immediately felt better. When I discussed this with other psychiatrists they agreed that it can exacerbate anxiety. This isn‚Äôt to scare you away because everyone handles it differently, just to make you aware so if you start to experience something similar you can better advocate for yourself.

Editing to add that I also have that super fun combination of mental health issues. Currently I take citalopram for the depression and adderall for ADHD. I‚Äôm still adjusting the adderall dosage but overall this combination works very well for me."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Also diagnosed with ADHD, GAD, and Dysthemia.

When I got my diagnosis last year I asked my PCP if he could prescribe something until I was able to see a psychiatrist for medication management. He said the only thing he could prescribe was wellbutrin so I gave it a shot.

Wellbutrin gave me headaches and did nothing for my most notable ADHD symptoms. The only benefit was feeling more emotionally even.

Once I was able to see a psychiatrist I tried vyvanse first and saw some definite improvement. However, I would have headaches or just not feel all that great if I wasn't getting at least 8 hours of sleep, eating at regular times, and staying insanely hydrated.

I am taking mydayis which is the golden ticket for me. I don't have any negative symptoms from the medication, my daily life is much easier, and my blood pressure and average heart rate have both come down to healthy levels.

Since starting stimulant treatment I have no more depressive symptoms but still have some lingering anxiety."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Massive improvement to depression, minor improvements to adhd for me"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I was on it in the past and started again. But honestly it does absolutely nothing for me. This time was to see if it would help with my ADD symptoms, like rumination and stuff. Not really. So for me, it‚Äôs a shit ADD drug and also a shit antidepressant. Haven‚Äôt wanted to smoke though, haha."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","For me, I didn‚Äôt notice any effects on anxiety and depression. It just made me extremely drowsy. From what my psychologist told me, there are certain medications that don‚Äôt work with the ADHD brain. Don‚Äôt quote me, but I believe that Wellbutrin could be one of them (along with the slew of other ones I‚Äôve tried for anxiety and depression before being diagnosed with ADHD.)"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Didn't do much for me. I was on it a few years ago for depression but got switched off. I was diagnosed with ADHD last year. So I was on it before I knew, but it didn't help with mood or with anything else I thought was depression stuff but was actually executive dysfunction"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",Gave me the most awful violent nightmares I've ever had. Never again.
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I was on it before we realized I had ADHD. My dr and i were just going through the motions of trying to figure out what would help my depression and anxiety symptoms. We decided to try wellbutrin because my mom has been on it for years. I was on it very shortly and it felt like a big nothing. It didn‚Äôt make me feel worse, just didn‚Äôt seem to help. So we decided to keep trying other meds. Thats the extent of my experience"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Absolutely hated it. Nothing felt real, I was even more depressed and moody, it made my mouth constantly taste like metal!? And, tmi, it‚Äôs one of the only antidepressants known to sometimes actually increase sex drive‚Ä¶. It took mine through the ROOF to the point of being uncomfortable and all consuming. 0/10 would never fkn touch it again."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I am currently on Vyvanse for ADHD (generally works well as long as i'm sufficiently rested and not testing my body's limits lol). I was first prescribed Vyvanse for ADHD because that's what I said I wanted to treat first. It was after finding the right Vyvanse dose that I felt necessary to be treated for my persistent depressive disorder, so my psychiatrist prescribed Wellbutrin then. 

To be very honest, I don't think Wellbutrin does anything for me, so much so that it's a literal challenge to take my meds consistently. I've went off cold turkey before (unintentionally) because I forgot and even then I didn't have any significant withdrawal symptoms. I was on and off Wellbutrin for a while and only recently started taking it consistently (have been taking for 2-3 months), and still feel the same. But it's also my first antidepressant so I don't know how i'm supposed to feel. (the last I checked, i'm still depressed! ha)"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I have the same three diagnoses and I am doing well on it. I also take Ritalin daily, but before I started that the Wellbutrin was helping me a lot :)"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","If you get tinnitus on it, immediately stop if you're on a low dose or titrate down and then stop if at a higher dose. A month since I left it, tinnitus is still, even if reduced."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",Wellbutrin made me sick to my stomach. I‚Äôm sticking with Vyvanse. It‚Äôs what my body seems to function best on.
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Oh man, I took such an emotional blunting from that. I rode it out as far as I could but I did not feel like myself at all the whole time I was on it.

It‚Äôs common for certain types of doctors if you don‚Äôt have much of a medication history to recommend it because it‚Äôs a ‚Äúsafer‚Äù bet. Doesn‚Äôt lean into addiction or selling habits as much. 

I‚Äôm not a fan but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs worked for someone."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",Honestly it made my ADHD symptoms worse. So I stopped it and doubled down on my zoloft.
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",It‚Äôs worthless I was on it didn‚Äôt do a thing soon as I treated the ADHD with stimulates it  completely went away you‚Äôd be surprised how much the attention deficit disorder feeds your depression and anxiety because you just don‚Äôt feel motivated can‚Äôt get anything done and can‚Äôt really focus on anything.
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",It treats my ADHD pretty well. I can‚Äôt take stimulants.
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I was first diagnosed with anxiety and depression.  
After getting diagnosed with ADHD, my dr. suggested Wellbutrin. We agreed my anxiety was not under control, and the dr. was concerned stimulants would amplify my anxiety.   


Wellbutrin helped remove quite a bit of brain fog, and I started feeling like a normal person. It showed me I was headed in the right direction for my treatment. Turns out my ADHD was a giant factor in my... anxiety! Once my ""anxiety"" was under control, I was approved to try stimulants. Ultimately, the stimulants provided the most help for me.   


It's curious though that doctors would prefer to prescribe an antidepressant that takes like 6 weeks to ""work"" vs a stimulant which will prove/not prove itself in a week.   


The key here is that you aren't actually going to know how it works for you until you try it. Everyone's chemistry is different. Good luck though. I hope you find something that works for you."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",Hated it.  Took it for depression and it made me more anxious.
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Hated it, actually hated all SSRIs, honest to god I don‚Äôt think they work at all! And I always develop this numbed and zinging feeling over my body when I was on it, tried Prozac Lexapro Wellbutrin, however all the negative things were gone when I was put on Dexedrine, if your depression is related to your adhd I‚Äôd say antidepressants don‚Äôt do shit but make you feel more dead inside."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I'm on wellbutrin 150mg for almost 6 month. It didn't start to work until week 12 or later, for me. 
Now it is good. 
Overall :
‚ñ™Ô∏éI have less mood swing ü§™‚ñ™Ô∏éless dark thoughts‚ò†‚ñ™Ô∏éa bit less episodes of major binge eatingüôä ‚ñ™Ô∏é and i would say a bit more energy. üí™
‚ñ™Ô∏éBetter sleep üò¥ 

Almost all side effects are gone by this time, except slightly elevated heart rate and blood pressure. Oh and raised libido (not sure if it's wellbutrin or just me being less sad and stopped constantly overeating) 
I've tried other antidepressants such as zoloft. Tried strattera. Tried different kind of adhd stimulants as well. 
I stopped them all and stayed with Wellbutrin and returned to adderall and eventually added Tenex to address ü´Äüíó side effects."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Almost back to square one, but not without hope"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Hey I have depression/anxiety and ADHD too! I‚Äôm on Zoloft and Wellbutrin with some Trazadone for sleep and I think it helps a ton! I think I take 300m of the extended release on top of my 100m Zoloft and it‚Äôs been at that level for a couple years. I was worried about the anxiety side of it but I tried it anyway because I wanted to see if it helped with ADHD and I also liked that it doesn‚Äôt usually cause weight gain. I didn‚Äôt experience any worse anxiety but also I don‚Äôt have panic attacks usually just ruminating anxiety or restlessness with some anxiety attacks occasionally. If you have issues with anxiety/panic attacks, psychosis, or an eating disorder or low weight I would 100% bring this up to the doctor and monitor that very closely. It‚Äôs not always a negative reaction but there‚Äôs no real way to know how it‚Äôs gonna affect you without trying. Good luck!"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I was just about to post this very question. My psychiatrist wants to put me on it since I have anxiety and PTSD. I‚Äôm hoping it helps with motivation and concentration issues. Truth be told I was hoping for adderall, but I‚Äôll follow her advice for now."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I started Wellbutrin XL 150mg a week ago and I have literally never felt better. I am also on 37.5 mg of Effexor and have been for years. I am so happy and carefree now. No anxiety, no depression. I literally cannot believe how great I feel. I am less hungry and more energetic!!! Give Wellbutrin a shot!"

"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I've been on 150mg for my ADD symptoms for a few years and it hasn't made any huge differences in my day-to-day life, but I do think that it has generally steered me in a better direction. In the year I started taking it I started actually going to the gym routinely and I FINALLY got my driver's licence (5th fucking try...). I recently upped my dose to 300 because the effects were so mild and I've had better focus the past few weeks, but I feel like that may wear off in the near future, and it also may have been because of exams stress. 

Negative effects have been extremely minimal for me except some anxiety and mood swings in the first few weeks. 

It may be worth noting that this is prescribed kind of as a last resort medicine for ADD where I live and ritalin and the lot made me super anxious and somewhat depressed. 

Hope that helps!"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","My psychologist took me off  Wellbutrin after years. I‚Äôve noticed I am more distractable, and yell at my kids more."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I‚Äôm currently on Wellbutrin for my recently diagnosed adhd and I just had a conversation with a friend today about how it isn‚Äôt helping my adhd. I‚Äôm on another antidepressant for my depression, I need something for my adhd. Went to a doctor earlier this week who was going to up my Wellbutrin dosage to the highest possible dose but she decided against it because I admitted I drink.

The friend I spoke with suggested just straight out asking for a stimulant if that‚Äôs what I think will work better."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","For me it was just the depression symptoms.

I have childhood trauma so that was taken care of first. I took prozac and effexor with wellbutrin and I had nasty side effects.  I was prescribed trintrillex which was perfect for me.  Trintrillex is a serotonin modulator and an SSRI.  


wellbutrin and trintrillex helped me with motivations (waking up, wanting to do dishes, sitting at my desk for studying) but it never got farther than that.  My psychNP suggested that it could be ADHD,  I would have never thought that, but my half sister was diagnosed around the same time.  my mom has had lots of mental health issues and I heard that it runs in families so I went to get a test.  


I take wellbutrin, trintrillex and adderall and I'm finally doing things.  Since I'm still titrating on adderall I still take all the meds at the dosage that has been good to me.  Personally I think that I wouldn't ever not take anti-depressants due to my history."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I had it, it gave me a bunch of tics. I switched to pristiq + some other adhd med and it's keeping me borderline alive and somewhat functional."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","i take wellbutrin in addition to lexapro.  the lexapro manages my anxiety really well and the wellbutrin keeps my depression under control.  it obviously doesn't fix everything but i was on just those two for almost two years and i was doing pretty well.  the problem is that they were treating my symptoms more than the cause of them; looking back it's pretty obvious that my adhd led to a lot of my anxiety and depression.  i'm currently on lexapro, wellbutrin, and methylphenidate and it's been a great combination for me.  my depressive episodes aren't as bad when they happen, my anxiety only gets worse in situations i used to avoid completely, and i can actually focus and get things done."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Sadly‚Ä¶didn‚Äôt help ADHD, but helped my depression immensely.

Pristiq really helped (I think since that and Wellbutrin act on both serotonin and norepinephrine, hitting the adhd from both angles helped).

Biggest life saver has been Adderall."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Wellbutrin raised my anxiety baseline.  I had to go off it after 2 weeks.  Having ADHD mixed with anxiety is difficult to treat. Stimulants only work very short term for me and requires a lot of breaks. 
I have to admit when I see the daily posts here about people discovering stimulants and basically crying cause their life is sooo much better I get discouraged. 
I guess my advice is to pay careful attention to 'fight or flight' feelings when starting ANY new medication because this usually means it's not for you."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I‚Äôve been on Wellbutrin (150mg) for a month after speaking to my doc about adhd. I gotta say‚Ä¶ the first week I felt amazing. Motivated to get out of bed, focused at work, productive at home. By week 3 I started feeling right back to my ‚Äúnormal‚Äù self. It‚Äôs now just over a month and I feel like it doesn‚Äôt work anymore. Which is a real shame, because I loved how mild-yet-effective it was."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I was put on Wellbutrin 150mg for a week and then 300mg after a week. I didn't stay on it long, but sometimes I wish I did. It almost instantly helped with my appetite and made it easier for me to get out of bed in the morning. 

I was using it for depression and ADHD. It helped with my appetite and depression. I cried more easily, which I did before Wellbutrin. I got off of it because I figured Adderall would be better and I was told it was. 

On Adderall I am able to focus and do more things, but I'm still not motivated to exercise like I used to. I have my days where my depression and anxiety are through the roof. 

I know meds work different for each person. I may go back in Wellbutrin the next time I talked to the doctor. I don't know."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Stay away from it, I experienced  massive short memory loss to the point that I didn't trust myself anymore with my car keys or asked my boss at work to repeat the same instructions multiple times in the same meeting.
Once I recognized it was Welbutrin, I stopped, and it took me about a year to get back to myself again."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","OP your situation sounds very similar to mine, did you ever try Wellbutrin out?

I was evaluated earlier this year and also diagnosed with GAD, Depression and ADHD.  I think I deal with my Depression/Anxiety fairly well on my own without medication (SSRIs have previously made me feel much worse instead of better) but my ADHD symptoms are starting to mess with my work performance which I can't have happening."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","omg same, but I‚Äôm still on Wellbutrin. I feel like it has done nothing, but when my doctor asks me if I want to stop taking it, I start doubting myself‚Ä¶maybe it works and I don‚Äôt remember correctly?"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Thanks for talking about it! I know that's not a fun time to go back and think about. I hope you're doing better now. I was put on effexor and then Zoloft and neither one worked out for me. They killed my libido and ultimately made me feel worse. I feel much happier on no meds but my ADHD symptoms are still a bear. And you're right, meds affect everyone differently. Hopefully I get a decent amount of responses here to get a more well rounded perspective."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I had pretty much the same experience. I was put on Ssri‚Äôs for depression and those just made me feel horrible while not really addressing any issues (depression, lack of focus, lack of motivation,) Doc suspected possible ADHD and we tried Wellbutrin. Felt the exact same. No energy boost, no change in motivation. Really the only thing I noticed is that it made my vape tasteless (I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs the smoking cessation use case of Wellbutrin). Been on adderall since my ADHD diagnosis and virtually every depression like symptom has been effected (not gone mind you)."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",Also did nothing for me. I was on it while I waited to get tested for adhd and I‚Äôm on adderall now
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",Where are you at now?
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",I'm glad to see I'm not the only one who's experiencing weightloss. Sorry to resurrect an old post. I've lost 15Ibs in the month I've been on it. I was getting worried so I started researching lmao.
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",That sounds wonderful!
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",[deleted]
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I hit it from the opposite direction. Ritalin for years then generic Wellbutrin to help. Basically as I understand it it helps provide more serotonin and the Ritalin uses serotonin. 
As with any medication you might find it wonderful. You do have to commit to taking it every day."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Thanks for letting me know! I am curious about stimulant meds, but I'm kind of afraid to ask for them outright."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",Exact same thing for me. Before Wellbutrin I tried SSRI antidepressants but they were awful for me
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",are you taking both? I like Wellbutrin for my depression but I need a stim for my adhd too
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",why ritalin instead of adderall?
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",This sounds exactly like my experience so far hahaha
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Do you happen to have a link to the article? 

I‚Äôm trying to get my doctor to take me seriously. Tried numerous classes of antidepressant medications over the last decade with minimal results. Currently on Wellbutrin but not super happy with it. I still need an official diagnosis but I think I also have a case to try something else like a stimulant. It‚Äôs kinda like What other drugs are there to try? Lol"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Wellbutrin actually takes about 4-6 weeks to start working. It needs to build up in your system. I'm on week 2, so hang in there!!"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Give it some time! Meds affect everyone differently. And sometimes it takes a few tries to find something that works for you. This will be the third med I've tried, if I decide to get on it. And if it doesn't work, I'll try something else. But no matter what I'm gonna go to CBT and keep working on myself."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","As someone who Wellbutrin didn‚Äôt work on I feel the need to chime in that if it‚Äôs working for you, don‚Äôt overthink it. We are all individuals with our own biology. It just didn‚Äôt work out with me."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",I had that experience with effexor after a while. I hope you're doing better now.
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",I had this when starting too. Luckily it was a side effect for me and went away within a week but the really bad suicidal ideation was intense and then the medication ended up doing thing for me.
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","It also gave me suicidal ideation, which put me in the hospital. I had been taking it for about 6 months, and it did nothing for my ADHD symptoms. One of the first things they did in the hospital was to change my meds. Feeling much better now. 

If it taught me anything, it‚Äôs that you should speak up if you‚Äôre in need of help and not let your doctor keep telling you just to stick it out if the side effects are too much."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",Oof that happened to me with adderoll what a horrible experience. Solidarity
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",Had that happen with Ritalin. My body does nottttttt like Ritalin. AT. ALL.
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",What did you double it to
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Thanks for the feedback! Were you prescribed it for ADHD specifically or do you also have anxiety and/or depression? I'm kind of curious how often it gets prescribed for ADHD, cause Google says it's a depression medication."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Good to know, thanks!"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",Thanks for the info! Glad you're doing better :-)
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Yeah, that's how I felt toward the end when I was on effexor. Not a good time. I hope it's been a while since you've felt that way."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Yeah, the nurse practitioner I saw specifically said it's kind of neutral as far as side effects go. But some of these comments are pretty wild lol."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Now that you say Lexapro, I think that's one of the meds I was on before that actually didn't work for me. I thought it was Zoloft, but I forgot about Lexapro. God damn ADHD memory lol. Anyway, I'm glad you found something that works for you!"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",Is lexapro an anti depressant? Is it normal to treat with two prescriptions like that?
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",I hope you're able to get something that works for you! I've had real issues with binge eating too. It is definitely *not fun*
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",Adderall was a god send for my binge eating. Even if it‚Äôs just a small dose.
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Holy shit, that sounds terrible! I'm glad you got off it! I hope you find something that works better for you. Thanks for sharing your story!"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",Be very careful with long term use of benzos like Klonapin. It can lead to brain fog and an increase in ADHD symptoms. Was on it for over 10 years.
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",[deleted]
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","All I can say is when I finally got on Zoloft, I was like ohhhhh this is how well antidepressants can work lol. Again didn‚Äôt cure it but there was such a huge difference for me from when I was on Wellbutrin. Personally I think you‚Äôll know for sure when a med is working for you, just based on my experience!"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",I would try to stay away from Wellbutrin IMO.  It gave me huge anxiety and I felt like I was drowning in it.
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Of course! Reading others‚Äô experiences with meds have helped me so much. I‚Äôm on Zoloft now and it has worked super well for my depression, and my psych has me trying Adderall for ADHD. I really hope you find one that works for you relatively soon ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",Why did you come off on Wellbutrin?
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Yes, when I first went on it in the 90s it was used for weight loss and smoking cessation, too. If you can't afford to lose weight, please be careful."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",Lots of things. Bunch of personal stuff in my life. Then I had to leave my job because my joints were fd. Couldn't afford docs and meds.
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",I'm going to the psychiatrist exactly now to see if I add Wellbutrin to my meds. I've been taking Ritalin and college is eating my soulü§©
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",A good doctor/psychiatrist will never be upset that you asked for something specific and usually encourage it. I‚Äôm studying psychology and it‚Äôs also my hyper focus so I‚Äôve had countless times where I go into the appointment and say ‚ÄúI wanna try something for this reason and that I think it‚Äôll help with this after doing research‚Äù no shame in suggest something for your own body!
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",I am taking both. And they both seem to be helping with the respective issues
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",Lots of little reasons. I didn‚Äôt know for sure that it would work before trying it but my psych thought it would be a good first try because it also worked for my adhd sister and I had taken a kind of dna test that my clinic offered and it indicated to her the same thing. So we gave it a shot
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Yeah look for my own experience with anti depressants just get tf off them unless you feel like you‚Äôll die without them. I‚Äôm waiting for my official diagnosis but I got off antidepressants prob 4 years ago now idk why but even then I knew they weren‚Äôt doing anything for me. Gave me go for a bit but I just kept repeating the same patterns, failure by consequence etc always knew something wasn‚Äôt right until someone pointed out about a year or more ago I might have adhd seeings I can‚Äôt sit down most of the time and I work in a construction job which is very physical, I honestly thought that was the cure to my depression lmao, tiring myself out every single day. But I just put my adhd in a better position to drive me.  Problem is as you become older and more stressed out the symptoms seem to get harder to control through healthy habits like my job and more about just getting properly fucking medicated. :( 

My current therapist who I‚Äôve been through all thus with told me the same and agrees"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",I‚Äôll try to find it! I‚Äôm pretty sure it was in attitudemag online or whatever lol but I‚Äôll have look for you!
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","ahhh that's such a hot minute!! i do remember my NP mentioning about 3 weeks it should turn up some, so hopefully it will after a month!! good luck, friend üíöüíö"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","ahh i needed to hear this, op, thank for commenting üß°üß° i am wishing the absolute BEST for you!!"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Funny I tried Wellbutrin and had bad headaches and didn‚Äôt feel like myself. But I have been on Effexor for some time and it has been wonderful for me, outside of some occasional night terrors, and fast withdrawal (forgot to fills meds and missed one day which resulted in a crying hysteria, until i got my refill)‚Ä¶. Also now working on finding an appropriate adderall dose."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","i‚Äôm doing better now, thank you! i hope the same for you"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","part of me wanted to stick it out for that reason because besides that, the side effects were light, and i liked other aspects of it! im glad it‚Äôs doing something for you"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","400, I think?"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","It was initially prescribed for depression, looking back now that was mostly due to a job I really didn't like with a shitty manager. Not sure if my doctor mentioned it might help with focus but I think it does, being in a better mood def helps for those tasks that really don't align with how our brain works."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","My psychiatrist (adhd specialist) told me that it is indeed a depression medication - however, I has been found to *also* have *some* positive benefits with adhd symptoms. So a lot of psychiatrists will prescribe this first, e.g. if you also have depression, or if they're not sure how bad your adhd symptoms would really be without depression/anxiety.     

My *personal* experience with it was so so. I was prescribed it, pre adhd diagnosis, for depression. It had been pretty bad and gotten better on other medication, and the doctor switched me to wellbutrin when I expressed that I felt like I didn't have trouble sleeping or anything anymore, but I still couldn't ever get myself out of bed. It worked really well then! It got me out of my hole, and it made it possible for me to bring structure back into my life and form healthy habits again.    
A few years later I went back because I felt like, while I wasn't really depressed, I was still struggling with life and school and I was afraid I would become depressed again. That time, it didn't really work; I ended up feeling shaky and anxious and wired all day but it didn't help get my tasks done. 
    
So just based on that I would say that if you're also depressed and the two are related, it might very well work quite well. It didn't completely solve my adhd problems, but it got me from zero routines and habits to half-functional and coping. Now I'm  trying to get the rest of the way there with therapy and stimulant medication."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","i'm not sure where you're at with this now, but i was just prescribed 150 mg of Welbutrin ER, adding to my 10 mg lexapro. i don't yet have an ADHD diagnosis but i suspect i have it, so i brought it up to my psychiatrist today. he was hesistant to give me a stim because of my anxiety diagnosis, so prescribed me welbutrin. he said it should help with focus because of the reuptake in dopamine and norepinephrine (a form of adrenaline) which is what would boost productivity and the like. i haven't started it yet but just wanted to add my anecdote for being prescribed it for focus!

edit: wanted to add that he said the lowest dose is 75 mg, so he started me up higher since it's being used for the focus aspect rather than to treat depression (which the lexapro is already helping to do, along with anxiety)"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Lexapro and Zoloft are both antidepressants called SSRI‚Äôs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). 

Wellbutrin is a type of antidepressant called norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). It safe to give together with SSRI‚Äôs for most patients because they work in different ways. 

I have found that Wellbutrin helps somewhat with some of my ADHD symptoms, but not nearly as effective as stimulants. It did wonders for my anxiety and depression though. It can also be given safely (for most patients) together with a stimulant. 

Everyone reacts differently however so for most people there‚Äôs a long trial and error phase to getting the right medication, plus we change over the years and might need to change meds accordingly."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I don't think combining Wellbutrin and Lexapro is especially common, but it's not uncommon to combine prescriptions. My doctor and I tried different things until we found a combination that works for me!"

"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","It has definitely been a rough time! But thank you so much! I hope you find something that will help you out, medications can be so tough to figure out at times! Wishing you the best"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I'm sorry if that happened to you, that must have been difficult to go through! I appreciate your concern and advice. I hope you're doing well now! I definitely don't want to use it long term at all. I've been on it for almost 6 months and don't take it unless my anxiety/panic is severe, so it's not constant/everyday use, but the plan is short term only!"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","As in over time, I take it for two months max at a time usually once a year."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Oh wow, this is giving me such hopes for me! I‚Äôm on Adderall for my ADHD, but I was on Wellbutrin even before (because I was scared of stimulants) and it did nothing for my symptoms. I didn‚Äôt get worse, so I thought that‚Äôs how it worked ops

Calling my doctor now to start tapering off Wellbutrin üôÇ thanks!"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",Thanks!
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I appreciate your concern! I'm considered overweight by my BMI, so technically losing some fat would do me good. It was more the speed of the weightloss that was my concern. My daily habits and activities haven't really changed since my diagnosis. I was surprised by the speed."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I‚Äôm considering adding Wellbutrin on my ADHD meds reverse of what you did, I have atypical major depression brought to on by ADHD. Only thing is I also have generalized anxiety which I was wondering if you had any experience with as ppl say anxiety starts doing crazy things or even surfacing in ppl without it when they start Wellbutrin."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I was an engineering student so I assumed college would eat my soul.  Its why I missed needing it.  I hope the wellbutrin works for you, and I'm glad your spotting the problem earlier then I did."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","My psych said she didn‚Äôt want to put me on adhd meds because it‚Äôs basically meth. Mind you I am in my late 30s and I have no idea how any of this works. I‚Äôve always felt like I‚Äôve been spaced out or ‚Äúnaturally high‚Äù. So I took a few online tests and scored like 80 to 100% for adult add. So when she said the ‚Äúm‚Äù word I was scared to even talk about my possible adhd diagnosis. She put me on Zoloft and it helped with my depression and anxiety but honestly I‚Äôve never felt more space out or cognitively impaired in my life. I am going to school for Respiratory therapy and tho it‚Äôs not joke, a lot of the stuff we learn is like high school math and yet I am struggling. I took stats over the summer like nothing. Idk what to do."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",Thanks for the encouragement!
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",I was diagnosed today and my NP told me I cannot take Wellbutrin XL and a stimulant together? She upped my Wellbutrin from 300mg to 450mg (I‚Äôve been on 300 for a year for depression and it‚Äôs a miracle drug for me). She said if 450 doesn‚Äôt work we need to switch me to Prozac and straterra or something because Wellbutrin and stims don‚Äôt mix??
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Thank you! Appreciate it. 

I get the emails of the articles but do you think I‚Äôve gotten to the point of actually reading? Nope. I have like 15 tabs open in my browser app that are all the articles I wanna read‚Ä¶. Someday‚Ä¶."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I started on it back in october and it's definitely not enough on its own *but* it was so weird the moment i noticed it start working....three weeks of absolutely no effect and then one day i had a meeting get pushed back an hour and thought ""oh i could really use that hour to take a shower and draft the follow up email i need to send"" and then just......went and did exactly that. i've *never* proactively written an email like that and just had this lightbulb moment of like oh maybe this means it's working"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Yeah def give it some time, I'm planning to give it two months before I make a decision. Good luck to you too!"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",Right back atcha! Good luck on your treatment journey! Let's keep getting better!
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",Thanks. I just started on Wellbutrin and I‚Äôm combing Reddit about it now lol
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Yeah, I agree with that. I might have to bring that up to my NP, cause my mood has already been better. I'd prefer to treat the ADHD symptoms directly. Thanks again for talking about it. Much appreciated!"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","This is my experience.  

I kind of get the feeling that my doctor is really hesitant to diagnose or prescribe anything for ADHD because she told me since I hadn't been treated for it since childhood I needed to have neuropsych testing and someone more specialized in it to diagnose (which is expensive and hard to schedule around here and I'm pretty sure she was thinking I wouldn't follow through).

So instead she said my main problem was anxiety and a little bit of depression and gave me Wellbutrin, which seems weird and hindsight with all the stuff I'm saying about how it contributes to anxiety, but it has slowed things down some and even though I didn't really have motivation I feel a little less scattered and better in a lot of ways."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Just curios, did it end up working out?"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Can you clarify the lingo? Zoloft is Wellbutrin? Lexapro is an SSRI, Wellbutrin is a NDRI?"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",Thanks!
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Yep, Adderall is known to be a helpful treatment against binge eating. In my own personal experience, I had struggled with obesity and binge eating for years before I was diagnosed and treated for ADHD. When I was prescribed Adderall I was in the best shape I had ever been and I had managed to finally be at peace with my eating and exercise habits. (That is a whole other story about how to form healthy habits)
It was amazing to not feel like I needed to constantly obsess over food. 

Adderal was prescribed to me because I was so forgetful and unmotivated everywhere else in my life. And even though I was happy with my weight and eating habits, during periods of high stress I would go right back into food cravings, binge, and feel sick. Adderal completely removed that binge desire. It took me several months to realize that had happened. I‚Äôd just say be careful if you are prescribed because it‚Äôs easy for the pendulum to swing the other way. I became borderline anorexic and underweight at some point. When I started losing hair that‚Äôs when I realized I needed to get my eating habits back in a better place. Balance is a life long journey! I hope you find the right care and combo that works for you.

Edited because the ADHD causes me to impulsively post comments but then obsessively review and revise my words until they are PERFECT"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Yay, I hope it goes well!"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I personally didn't have an increase in anxiety. However, it seems my depression and ADHD cause the anxiety so treating both alleviates the anxiety as well. Wellbutrin was the only one that really worked for me. Effexor was kind of ok. SSRIs...nope, they were miserable.

I'm not a doc but as far as I know the side effects aren't permanent. (Please don't take my word for it, though) You could stop taking it if it's not working well. Might be worth risking a few bad anxiety days to see if it helps. Depression is no joke."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre dealing with that :( while amphetamines (Adderall/Vyvanse) and methylphenidate (Ritalin/Concerta) are technically like meth in terms of chemical composition, meth is short for methamphetamines so is a different drug. 

The stigma of treating people with ADHD who take stimulants in order to function like they are drug addicts or drug abusers is incorrect and a really shitty thing for a doctor to promote.

I take Vyvanse and started about 3 weeks ago. I‚Äôve felt the affects for sure and find my brain fog is a lot better and surprisingly my mood has been more stable (I also take SSRIs and Wellbutrin so I wasn‚Äôt expecting my mood to be helped by Vyvanse), but I didn‚Äôt feel any cravings for the meds or anything like that. 

Also just for the sake of spreading info, there are non-stimulant drugs that can be used for ADHD symptoms. Wellbutrin that I take is suggested for treating depression in ADHD people (among other things), and I did take Atomoxetine (Strattera). They are different drug classes (NDRI and SNRI) and can be good for people who don‚Äôt want to take stimulants or want to try something different first. I hope this helps! Also disclaimer of course that I‚Äôm not a doctor, just a psychology student who really likes looking into different psychiatric meds"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",I was diagnosed last week and my psych also upped me from 300mg to 450mg. I feel like it's having the opposite effect on me... my memory is shit and I've never been so distracted.
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","My doctor has me on the Wellbutrin combined with my Adderall and I've noticed that it makes the Adderall work a lot smoother. For me, the Wellbutrin is being used for it's antidepressant effect, but I have noticed a slight decrease in my ADHD symptoms after I take it and before I add in the Adderall."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",This gives me hope. I‚Äôm on week one and I feel nothing except maybe even more depressed than before. I‚Äôm going to keep giving it time.
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",Glad to help! I genuinely miss it.
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Yeh I mean I wouldn‚Äôt use it as your primary treatment but there‚Äôs not going to be a single cure all. Better to look at it from all the angles. My primary care doctor had no problem starting me on a small dose of Adderall. Dr.s usually start an appointment with a ‚Äúhow is everything‚Äù type intro, that‚Äôs when I‚Äôd throw in you‚Äôre having trouble focusing and have been researching adhd, ask their thoughts."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","i've definitely seen an increase in productivity and motivation since starting. i noticed that i didn't feel it all throughout the day though, which is what my goal was - for me it tapered off around 6 pm while i'd taken it at 8 am. i just switched to standard release and upped to 200 mg daily - so i take 100 in the morning and then another 100 around 3, and then i'm awake and motivated from morning to late evening! 

i do think the combo with lexapro helps, since that is working on the depression aspect itself already. 

it doesn't feel super uppity like vyvanse/adderall if you've had those (although when my body was adjusting it did lol) but brings me to a great level for day to day, and i'm able to sleep on it. 

i also find that i'm able to still drink caffeine and don't feel overloaded, if that was a concern

all in all, i would say i've had a positive experience so far and would suggest it!"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Zoloft and Wellbutrin are completely different medications. 

Zoloft and Lexapro are SSRIs, so are Prozac, Celexa, Luvox, and Paxil. They are used to treat mostly anxiety and depression, although they can have other uses (OCD, PMDD, PTSD, hot flashes, and premature ejaculation, to name a few). 

Wellbutrin is an NDRI. It‚Äôs also used for depression and anxiety, and smoking cessation, but it is more activating and in some people can make the anxiety worse. It is sometimes used ‚Äúoff label‚Äù for ADHD, but does not have FDA approval for that. It increases dopamine in your system and therefore theoretically should be able to help ADHD."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",[deleted]
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","First off, thank you so much for your well thought out response. Second, yeah I don‚Äôt think I want to go back to that doctor. She‚Äôs helped me with a lot of things but not so much with the adhd stuff. I will bring this information up to another psych if I can."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",Did you feel any symptoms/side effects leading up to the seizure? Doctor increased my dose to 300mg and my neck and back of my head have been so sore and tense and just weird feeling! I'm paranoid.
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Yeah, I just saw a nurse practitioner today and had this exact conversation. He mentioned Wellbutrin, so I posted this question lol. I am absolutely approaching this holistically, from as many angles as I can. So I plan on getting CBT, I've been eating better and exercising, and I'm considering medication. I'm just not sure I see the need to get on depression medication when I'm not having depression symptoms anymore."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","Thank you so much.

I‚Äôm sorry to hear that things are hard right now. It sounds like you are completely overwhelmed. 

It might help to hear that sometimes grades are going to slip, and sometimes classes have to be taken more than once. It doesn‚Äôt mean you are broken or that everything is going wrong. College is really hard and anyone who is just breezing through like it‚Äôs no big deal is a lizard person. Stay away from the lizard people. 

Talk to your professors. Trust me. Their hearts yearn for students to come to them for help. It‚Äôs why they do what they do. They want to change lives. 

Take care of yourself and trust things will feel better in the morning. üíõ"
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",Good luck! I‚Äôve been through the process of finding good therapists/doctors and it sucks but you‚Äôll find someone good eventually!
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?","No, but I was also in the middle of the worst depressive crisis of my life, so my memory of that time isn‚Äôt the best."
"Who here has tried Wellbutrin, and what's your experience?",Okay! Thank you for responding! üòå

What to expect from Wellbutrin ,"Wellbutrin saved my life when I was very depressed. I didn‚Äôt realize it at the time but I think it helped a lot with ADHD symptoms when I didn‚Äôt know I had it yet. I have recently finally been able to get a more stable combo of both Wellbutrin and Adderall and together my life is starting to change, but the Adderall on top of the Wellbutrin is what made a huge difference."
What to expect from Wellbutrin ,"It didn‚Äôt really work for me, but keep in mind that there‚Äôs some negative bias with online reviews. If the medication works well, people are less likely to write reviews about it."
What to expect from Wellbutrin ,"Wellbutrin changed my life for the better. I was consistently failing in school and throwing away opportunities. I had been on straterra for two years and had convinced myself that I was working perfectly, it wasn‚Äôt. It wasn‚Äôt until my psychiatrist flat out asked me if I was it‚Äôs it was helping when I realized it wasn‚Äôt. She prescribed me Qelbree and it was atrocious, I had never experienced insomnia until then. Another doc visit and I was prescribed Wellbutrin XL. Things immediately began to change, I was completing tasks, I would get through the whole day and not feel exhausted at the end and the craziest part is that my brain would go quiet at times! I hadn‚Äôt experienced that in year‚Äôs. I‚Äôm also taking Prozac for anxiety so I‚Äôm not sure if that would affect my success with Wellbutrin at all but I hope that it helps you out too ‚ù§Ô∏è best of luck!"
What to expect from Wellbutrin ,"I would take that and adderall in the morning and get all types of nervous energy, not the normal anxiety, but actually nervous. I have been off caffeine for like 3 weeks now and I feel way better with anxiety. I think adderall, Wellbutrin and coffee kicked my butt"
What to expect from Wellbutrin ,"I was prescribed Wellbutrin specifically for ADHD since I do not want to use stimulants. I have not tried it yet since she is starting me on Lexapro first. 

I am curious to see how you feel. Please share with us!"
What to expect from Wellbutrin ,"Can I ask why Wellbutrin was the first option being explored?  I ask because while this does vary by country, this would be considered an off label use. I know it is relatively common, though. My PCP told me that barring physical ailments that would take stimulants off the table, non-stimulant treatments for ADHD are ""pissing in the wind"". 

My husband took it for a while and absolutely hated it, but not for any of the big scary side effects that you see when you look on WebMD and places like that. It just made him extremely sleepy, had a really hard time getting up in the morning and was missing work. 

Everybody's bodies are different, and unless you have any really serious side effects, I would stick it out for a little while and see how it affects you long-term."
What to expect from Wellbutrin ,"I had the 3-4 most active days of my life then I crashed like a chopper in a Michael Bay movie. Insane feeling of tired buzzedness, I insist on insane. Like my then SO told me to stop that shit or she would kick me out."
What to expect from Wellbutrin ,OP can you update us on how you like the meds?
What to expect from Wellbutrin ,"Listen. I‚Äôve heard both good & bad about it. Just remember this‚Ä¶people as a whole are quick to post NEGATIVE reviews of something than they ever will positive reviews. Take that into consideration, placebo is also a very real thing, so if you go into it thinking it will have a negative impact on you, you‚Äôll likely contribute anything negative in your life to the medication itself"
What to expect from Wellbutrin ,"I was on it briefly. I used it to increase my sex drive since I‚Äôm on so many other psych meds it absolutely killed it. I did fine up to 300mg but didn‚Äôt really bring back my sex drive. She put me up to 450mg and I tried it for one day and felt absolutely so weird - which she told me might happen. I ended up coming off of it because it didn‚Äôt help at all. 450mg is an insanely high dose and wouldn‚Äôt recommend.

Are you using it for ADHD? (I‚Äôve never heard of anyone using it for that) Or are you using it for something like depression?

I also worked in pharmacy for 10 years so I‚Äôm pretty good with med knowledge for the most part if you had questions :)"
What to expect from Wellbutrin ,Wellbutrin drove me absolutely insane. I had to stop taking it. No bueno. For me‚Ä¶ I hear it works well for some people. FAFO.
What to expect from Wellbutrin ,"It helped with the depression stemming from ADHD symptoms. I can't take Adderall or any amphetamines due to my history of meth abuse, maybe way later, but right now is too soon. But Wellbutrin is definitely geared more towards my depression ...it's a subtle but noticeable difference.  Doesn't help me much with focus. But overall more consistent minimal productivity...hope that makes sense. I like it, I keep taking it, it's necessary for me. Lol ROUSING endorsement, I know"
What to expect from Wellbutrin ,my husband has been on it a couple of months for depression. He seems to be doing pretty well on it --it's helping the depression a bit but its not curing it. He still struggles.
What to expect from Wellbutrin ,"I have been on it for several years. It is better than a lot of meds I've been on because it doesn't make me as tired. It doesn't work as well as other meds, but I have had fewer side effects. Keep track of your blood pressure. I felt super euphoric the first few days I was on it but that evened out. I hope it helps you."
What to expect from Wellbutrin ,"It's interesting that your doctor is starting you with Wellbutrin to treat the ADHD. I switched from duloxetine to wellbutrin to treat my depression and if worked well. However, I still experienced a lot of ADHD symptoms that affected my quality of life. Like the others who posted, I was prescribed Adderall. The combo of both prescriptions has made life manageable and enjoyable. I can finally attend classes (currently in college), pay attention, and actually ENJOY what I learn. There was a period where I believed I was in the wrong program. Now, I remember why I chose teaching and how much I love learning."
What to expect from Wellbutrin ,"I‚Äôm on Wellbutrin XL right now, so I‚Äôm waiting for it to kick in.  I‚Äôm hoping that it is soon because I‚Äôm STRUGGLING with staying caught up in schoolwork. It‚Äôs been almost a month. So far I haven‚Äôt noticed a difference. I may stop taking it at nighttime with my Abilify. I have BPD, bipolar, and ADHD apparently. I think I might have ASD in some form too. Just waiting for it to kick in :)"
What to expect from Wellbutrin ,"Agree! 100% and this is my same experience. I will say only the quick release helped me and I tried the timed release years later and I felt it really did nothing, but I didn‚Äôt realize there as 2 different types until more recently or I might have tried it again instead of adderal‚Ä¶. I‚Äôve gotten things pretty dialed in now other wise I would!"
What to expect from Wellbutrin ,in my own personally experience with trying to find the perfect medication that will absolutely work best with reducing the endlessly annoying symptoms I deal with 24/7 thanks too adhd I have found non stimulants totally useless  at controlling my very annoying symptoms on any level and you are definitely people will rarely post anything even lightly  positive mostly cause positivity especially online gets very little attention
What to expect from Wellbutrin ,The way my doctor explained it. They‚Äôre attempting to use it to treat two things at once since I also apparently have depression. Turns out people aren‚Äôt generally sad all the time. This supposedly treats both of those in its own way.
What to expect from Wellbutrin ,Sure I‚Äôll write an update rn
What to expect from Wellbutrin ,This is the conclusion I came to but still my worry is there so I figured I‚Äôd make a post just to see what people have to say
What to expect from Wellbutrin ,"You should know this medication is mostly used to treat ADHD. I am on wellbutrin for ADHD + ADD, & it‚Äôs been good for about a year. Now i‚Äôm having some health issues & wondering if maybe this medication is the cause for it."
What to expect from Wellbutrin ,"Yes I think instant release is most helpful for ADHD but it is not commonly prescribed. There are 3 different versions and I have been on all 3. I also have POTS and the extended release was intolerable for that. I have been on 100 mg SR once a day for many years. That version is intended to be taken twice a day so I am a few days into trying that out finally and then I take 5 mg Adderall IR in the morning as well, also hoping to add a 2nd one around lunch time. I was diagnosed with ADHD 2.5 years ago and I‚Äôm only just now getting on a consistent regimen that is working so it can be such a process!"
What to expect from Wellbutrin ,Yay ty glad its helping a bit so far! I wish you luck
What to expect from Wellbutrin ,"I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs mostly used for adhd, I would say it‚Äôs an off label use - at least where I‚Äôm from. You can use Wellbutrin for all sorts of uses. It‚Äôs mainly for depression, but can be used for adhd, or sex drive and people also can use Wellbutrin SR to quit smoking. 

Typically the go-to approach would be to try an amphetamine such as Adderall, vyvanse, Dexedrine etc. there are reasons why doctors would avoid giving these drugs. You could have heart problems, addiction problems, or the physician might just be hesitant to give a controlled substance right off the jump, especially now that everyone on social media is claiming they all have ADHD. There are other drugs that are not amphetamines that are used for ADHD such as strattera or intuniv, people don‚Äôt like it as much because they find it doesn‚Äôt work as well as an amphetamine."
What to expect from Wellbutrin ,"Oh okay, yes I see where you are coming from for sure! I was on vyvanse for about a year before for mild depression, but my body did not react well to it at all, my dr then diagnosed me with severe ADHD (what is causing me to be depressed) + ADD. She switched me from vyvanse to wellbutrin. Only 150mg a day. (XL)

Are you saying that wellbutrin is known to cause heart problems? Because I was fine on this medication for awhile up until 2 weeks ago. - i‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs this medication causing my symptoms but my heart is pounding, rapid heart rate, palpitations, with lots of other symptoms. It could be anything at this point but I did read a lot on this medication & it is also known to cause rapid heart rate, i just don‚Äôt know if the dose is high enough to be causing this. (just asking if ever you have any advice) not too sure what to do anymore!"
What to expect from Wellbutrin ,"Every drug has an array of side effects and effects people differently. A rapid heart beat is more likely on an amphetamine than Wellbutrin but that is a side effect that can happen. But they are completely different and not in the same class of drug.

150mg is a normal dosing for Wellbutrin xl, but if you‚Äôre having heart issues then I would stop - with obviously your doctors discretion on directions how they want you to stop it. I wonder if your doctor would be open to trying an amphetamine with an antidepressant. I currently am on vyvanse 50mg and at one point was up to 60mg of Prozac. This combination works well for me, however what works for me, might not work for you. You honestly might have to try a few different cocktails of meds to get the right combination.

Edit: or you could try a non-stimulant drug for adhd such as intuniv or strattera. I‚Äôm not sure where you‚Äôre from so drugs might be different. I‚Äôm in Canada. But I wouldn‚Äôt give up hope, there are tons of options out there. You just have to be patient in finding the right combination."
What to expect from Wellbutrin ,"Yes totally! I‚Äôm in Canada as well.

I don‚Äôt like the effects of meds in general, i‚Äôd rather be off all meds but sadly I always fall into a depression. I was happy on wellbutrin alone, but if it‚Äôs the cause for these symptoms then i‚Äôd rather get off them. I‚Äôm not the type that‚Äôs willing to try a bunch of meds to get the right ones as I don‚Äôt have the luxury to be up & down, nor feel awful on some meds. I also find it difficult to astablish was is causing my symptoms (is it the meds or is it not). All the doctors I have seen so far have said that wellbutrin does not cause my symptoms, that I am having panic attacks. however, i know i am not. They gave me clonazepam (awful medication for me) it calmed my head to the point where I was woozy & very uncomfortable, but again, my symptoms were the same but x5. I do not have any panic attacks or feel fear, but when my heart rate reaches 171bpm and I am feeling extremely faint, my body naturally gets anxious. I know you‚Äôre not a dr lol at this point i‚Äôm just venting. It‚Äôs getting very difficult to deal with. Thanks for your help anyways!!"
What to expect from Wellbutrin ,"Of course you know your body best, and only you know what you‚Äôre willing to do and not do. Depression is a thing of its own but there are things with adhd that can help you that don‚Äôt have to be medication. Medication doesn‚Äôt cure adhd anyways, it basically just makes you function better but there are traits of adhd that even medication might not help.

I would look into a different drug for depression because medication can definitely help with that. Therapy could also be useful, but I know it‚Äôs expensive and not everybody has insurance to pay for it.

Depending on what type of adhd you have you can find things that help. I have inattentive so for me I‚Äôm hella forgetful so I write lists. Or at work I‚Äôll set timers on my watch. Double alarms on my phone just in case I missed the first one. Agendas are brilliant because it‚Äôs a visual of what your day or month looks like. Honestly you could even make a post in this subreddit asking for tips."

Experiences with Wellbutrin?,"I have all three diagnoses, plus an ‚Äúunspecified‚Äù mood disorder that we‚Äôre figuring out in therapy. 

I‚Äôve been on Wellbutrin since July 3 and I haven‚Äôt felt any relief from depression, anxiety, or ADHD, and I‚Äôve started having mood swings. I also can‚Äôt sleep at night anymore, even with 50mg of hydroxyzine. I already wasn‚Äôt getting a lot before Wellbutrin and it‚Äôs gotten worse. I started at 150mg for two weeks, jumped to 300mg on July 24, no difference, and I just started the highest dose a few days ago at 450mg. No difference for me except mood swings and sleeplessness :/"
Experiences with Wellbutrin?,"i was on 300 for about a year and didn't think it did much but help some with depression. i just recently upped it to 450 and it has given me just enough of an edge to improve with my adhd symptoms. I do much better but I am more likely to get angry however but i hope that will go away. My anxiety has increased a bit too but i am working on that in other ways. For me, it was well worth it. It really helps me push past my executive dysfunction which is my worst symptom 

  
Please be aware for some people wellbutrin/bupropion can make them manic and/or trigger psychosis and should you feel these symptoms at any point you would need to speak to a doctor ASAP"
Experiences with Wellbutrin?,"I'm on Vyvanse and Wellbutrin and its working amazingly for me, although still not quite the magic pill I naively imagined when I was first diagnosed"
Experiences with Wellbutrin?,I got diagnosed with ADHD while on wellbutrin. I still take it for depression though. Goes well with the adderall I started taking
Experiences with Wellbutrin?,"wellbutrin was the first medication i was prescribed that actually helped with my adhd. after telling a doctor i had tried ssris for years, i was prescribed it for anxiety and depression ‚Äî both of which were actually caused by issues with executive function/focus at work/staying on top of daily tasks. it helped for a while, but i did reach a ceiling with it. it also did not help nearly as well as vyvanse currently helps. it did, however, put me on the path to discovering the root cause of my anxiety, which was adhd!"
Experiences with Wellbutrin?,"It gave me tinnitus while on it and for a bit afterwards as well.


It could make me a bit agitated as well.


I don't do SSRI's anymore. I was doped up for ADHD as a kid and I really don't want to go back to that numbness.¬†"
Experiences with Wellbutrin?,It did nothing for me. Adderall changed my life though.
Experiences with Wellbutrin?,It has no effect on my ADHD.
Experiences with Wellbutrin?,"Everyone is so different with their reactions to meds‚Ä¶ I started feeling really depressed while on the Wellbutrin and would randomly start crying at times when I was having fun. As soon as I got off, I started feeling back to normal. Be patient (even though it sucks), it took me about 8 months of trying new meds/combinations every 3 weeks to finally find the right fit for me!"
Experiences with Wellbutrin?,"I cant take stimulants, i took adderall and crashed severally but with Wellbutrin my symptoms are pretty well managed with the addition of Abilify to my little party. Everyone is different but I‚Äôve been stable and much happier with the change"
Experiences with Wellbutrin?,"I‚Äôm currently on Wellbutrin. I‚Äôve tried XL and SR. In my experience, the SR helped with the ADHD issues. Both worked for depression."
Experiences with Wellbutrin?,"Wellbutrin was given to me because I was  breast feeding my baby when I was diagnosed.

It has absolutely improved my life. 

However!!

My friend was on it, and heard voices telling her to drive off a bridge.

Like anything in life, but especially medications... Ymmv"
Experiences with Wellbutrin?,Buspar worked well for me I have ADHD and anxiety. Wellbutrin was always aggravated my anxiety.
Experiences with Wellbutrin?,"I'm on Lexapro and was just out on Wellbutrin a few weeks ago. I haven't had a melt down since being in the Wellbutrin but I've not gotten any relief from the not being able to accomplish tasks and going into a paralysis when I start thinking about everything I need to do. I think the Wellbutrin is XL and it's a low dose. 

A friend of mine used to be in Wellbutrin but it did not go well with his system. He had bad mood swings."
Experiences with Wellbutrin?,"Wellbutrin helped me immensely during school. Helped me maintain a stable energy level throughout the day, decreased my anxiety and helped my focus a little bit. It also really prevents me from going into my lows that I used to get. I also don‚Äôt withdrawal from it so when I forget to take it for a month it‚Äôs not like an ssri that destroys you lol.  

Once I started my real job I needed an actual stimulant but tbh I was taking Wellbutrin for anxiety and didn‚Äôt know it was off label adhd treatment until I went to a psych. Makes a lot of sense why it increases people‚Äôs anxiety but soothes mine now lmfao."
Experiences with Wellbutrin?,"Bupropion seems to be exceptionally polarizing, and like everyone has said, of course ymmv.

For me, it's been great for depression, but didn't put a dent in the ADHD other than finally being not depressed enough to have motivation to try to get my ADHD treated. (At the time I was rawdogging it in terms of prescribed meds, but had been bumming Vyvanse or Adderall off of friends while too overwhelmed to get a proper doctor for myself, much less a psych)

It's also had the weird effect of lowering the threshold at which stimulants make me sleepy - now too little makes me tired, and too much sends me straight to nap city or zombies me out really hard (much more so than before) making the therapeutic window very narrow. Careful dosage adjustments have made it manageable, and I've found the Wellbutrin valuable enough for depression that I've been on it for nearly 8 yrs now. 

I also think the classic Wellbutrin rage effect finally got to me: I've always gotten what I call the rebound zoomies when stimulants wear off, but the combo made me -extemely- irritable (Adderall was a he worst, Concerta better but not great, and Focalin xr, which is what I'm on now is a bit better but not perfect) and made me feel like a caged tiger pacing my cage m, but adding clonidine in the evenings has really helped with that."
Experiences with Wellbutrin?,oh geez i‚Äôm so sorry to hear this! i may not end up on wellbutrin at all but it‚Äôs good to hear both sides of people who have taken it.
Experiences with Wellbutrin?,oof that‚Äôs unfortunate. i‚Äôve never been on any mental health medications so i‚Äôm pretty anxious about the whole thing!
Experiences with Wellbutrin?,stimulants scare me just because of my heart rate.
Experiences with Wellbutrin?,I did the abilify x Wellbutrin cocktail and it didn‚Äôt work for me at all. Woke up in the middle of the night every night and didn‚Äôt help with any of my anxiety. Switched to a stimulant and it saved me
Experiences with Wellbutrin?,Did it take some time for you to notice you felt different? I know some medications take effect after a longer time taking it than others.
Experiences with Wellbutrin?,"No worries! I‚Äôll try something different. It may be wonderful for you. My dad took it and he loved it. Worked very quickly for him too. I‚Äôm not sure if he has ADHD or anything else, but he had a great experience."
Experiences with Wellbutrin?,I've heard friends liking zoloft. Ask your doc about that.
Experiences with Wellbutrin?,Do you have a heart issue?
Experiences with Wellbutrin?,"I take 20mg IR a day with a medication-vacation (a day off it) about once a week. My resting heart rate is 61-71 bpm and I get a decent amount of cardio with no problems. I think it does raise my heart rate a tiny bit, but it‚Äôs cancelled out by not being nervous, anxious, and depressed which also had my heart rate jacked and has reduced it."
Experiences with Wellbutrin?,Ah damn sorry to hear that :(( i have sleep apnea so I get the sleep struggle
Experiences with Wellbutrin?,I felt the effects right away.
Experiences with Wellbutrin?,"as i stated in my original post, yes, i have sinus tachycardia."
Experiences with Wellbutrin?,"Forgive me. Paying attention at the end of the day is still an adventure. ü§¶üèª But, at least I don‚Äôt beat myself up as much about it afterwards."
Experiences with Wellbutrin?,i apologize for being a little short. been having some frustrating online interactions recently!
Experiences with Wellbutrin?,It‚Äôs ok! You‚Äôll get this figured out. Work with your doctor and you‚Äôll eventually find what works for you. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Advice for Wellbutrin,[removed]
Advice for Wellbutrin,"It does have stimulant properties but didn't really do much for me. It may help you if you smoke though- it makes cigarettes taste like crap, and they use a form of it to help people quit smoking. It does work well for some people. Good luck!! Hope it works out for you"
Advice for Wellbutrin,"I just started taking Wellbutrin as my second non-stimulant. I took strattera before and it had a shorter half life so It was fading halfway through the day. Personally so far, I've felt better on Wellbutrin. I also have a few friends who also take it for ADHD and it has worked well for them. Everyone is different though! I would give it a shot and see how you like it, but start on the lower dosage like 150mg."
Advice for Wellbutrin,"i‚Äôm on wellbutrin right now while i wait for adderall (doctor and financial issues‚Ä¶) and it helps but not as much. you might have trouble sleeping the first few days, it‚Äôs supposed to suppress your appetite as well but i already have issues with that so i‚Äôm not sure if it did that for me. overall it‚Äôs not bad, helps my mood but doesn‚Äôt do much for focus"
Advice for Wellbutrin,"Wellbutrin does have mild stimulant properties and can affect your sleep. When I took it I would take the extended release right before bed to try and prevent the sleep issues, but eventually had to add Trazodone to help me sleep. I'm undiagnosed - caffeine doesn't affect me so I was surprised that Wellbutrin just made me completely unable to sleep.

Wellbutrin is in a drug class of its own so if you've had less than great times on SSRIs or want to avoid SSRI side effects, it could be a good match. Wellbutrin is not known to have sexual side effects like SSRIs are notorious for, and forever ago I saw a study claiming it may even help reverse lingering sexual side effects from long term SSRI use.

Obviously YMMV and not everyone does great on every medication."
Advice for Wellbutrin,"I took Wellbutrin long release 450mg for 2-3 years and there wasn't really any effect besides side effects, I also don't have too much effect from caffeine"
Advice for Wellbutrin,"Be mindful of new feelings, sensations, or symptoms. There‚Äôs a list of temporary and permanent side effects while taking wellbutrin. I had insomnia and racing thoughts, both listed as temporary on Google. Tinnitus flares started around week three, listed as permanent. They got worse and worse over the next few days/weeks so I stopped taking it. Tinnitus went back to my normal level about three weeks later."
Advice for Wellbutrin,"I love it. It's in the same class as stimulants, but it's not technically one so it's easy to prescribe. I currently take a mix of it and regular stimulants, but on Wellbutrin alone I had to be more careful about losing my temper. Like, it helped me pay more attention to things happening around me and some of it made me mad! It's like adding Adderall helps me slow the reaction time. Fun fact, made from qhat leaves."
Advice for Wellbutrin,What main positives did it bring if you don‚Äôt mind me asking?
Advice for Wellbutrin,I take it before bed roflmao.
Advice for Wellbutrin,Thanks for the advice and wishes
Advice for Wellbutrin,So it does not do much to reduce the mental noise?
Advice for Wellbutrin,My doc said it may even improve the old sex life!
Advice for Wellbutrin,i deal with a lottt of mental noise and don‚Äôt think i‚Äôve noticed a reduction but it‚Äôs possible there‚Äôs less? definitely still have too many racing thoughts but i‚Äôve yet to find a single thing that helps with that (besides maybe alcohol but obviously not healthy long term coping mechanism lol)
Advice for Wellbutrin,but also keep in mind medications affect everyone differently and it may work better for you! this is just my experience
Advice for Wellbutrin,it did for me.
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"Hi /u/Charmel27 and thanks for posting on /r/ADHD!

I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"That‚Äôs a lot of stimulants to be on at once. Did the explain why they‚Äôre putting you on both Adderall and vyvanse? 

It‚Äôs not unusual to get high heart rate and anxiety spikes with stimulants. I know I had to go off of Ritalin because it was making me too anxious. If it‚Äôs persisting, something definitely has to change with your meds and I‚Äôm sorry that they haven‚Äôt been listening to you"
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"I‚Äôve been taking Wellbutrin and adderall together for nearly 20 years without any problem whatsoever. I take adderall XR in the morning and then a booster dose of adderall instant release in the afternoon. Plus wellbutrin daily. It‚Äôs totally fine to take them together and doesn‚Äôt cause serotonin syndrome unless you‚Äôre taking hugely excessive amounts. 

Perhaps the dosages of adderall and Vyvanse you took were too high?"
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"This actually isn‚Äôt a ridiculous regimen, and while it didn‚Äôt work for you, there is a logic to taking all 3. Also, many people have no trouble taking Wellbutrin and adderall, it‚Äôs actually fairly common. I‚Äôm sorry you didn‚Äôt feel listened to though, thats a shame. Especially given it sounds like you‚Äôre being given the type of holistic ADHD treatment most of us would kill for, but it requires a more engaged provider to be effective. I hope you find a regimen that works for you!"
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"No, a provider shrugging off a high heart rate and shortness of breath while on three stimulants is MESSING UP and a major red flag."
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"I just wanted to point out that this is the second post in two days about a patient telling their doctor they want *fewer* stimulants and the doctor totally disregarding them. What the heck? Good luck, OP."
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"Um, one thing first:

>but my husband kept assuring me that it was just the medications causing Serotonin syndrome and that going to the hospital would just costs thousands of dollars for them to say the same

Even if he were right, this wouldn't be ""just"" serotonin syndrome. Serotonin syndrome is potentially life threatening and 100% means you should go to the hospital or at a minimum call your provider and speak to someone (and go to the hospital if you can not do this). I am seriously concerned by why your husband thought this would have been a minor/no biggie thing and a waste of time and money to go to the hospital over. I doubt he was acting maliciously and probably wanted you to feel better, but please, uh.... do not let him dismiss a severe medication reaction with ""it's fine because it's *only* (life threatening medication reaction)"". Spending money being observed by professionals and then told you're going to be okay is preferable to putting yourself in danger by trying to save that money for a potentially very dangerous medication reaction.

Second, while it is entirely possible to be someone who benefits from a combination of stimulants, it's also pretty normal to be effected adversely by medications known to have interactions and that can individually cause these side effects as it is. It's also completely awful that your medication provider would... just dismiss this kind of severe interaction as no biggie and insist that ""it's fine"" to do. I would really consider contacting a practice supervisor over this, because the reaction seems extremely negligent. It's not negligence to good-faith prescribe a medication that a patient happens to react to, but treating your reaction where you thought you were dying as nothing to worry about is very concerning."
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"How you were treated isn't acceptable.  


That said as I am also on the same anti-depressant I looked it up.  


The instances of serotonin syndrome symptoms that seem to be being referenced are MASSIVE MASSIVE over doses.   


Like the two I found referenced as proof that it causes it were one where a 14 year old took 2250 mg (30x75mg pills at once) intentionally, and another where a 19 year old took 7950mg (53x150mg). I've searched multiple websites now and they all seem to reference these two cases.  


So it seems like it's not at all a realistic possibility short of taking ""attempted suicide"" levels in order to do so.   


Now being a reaction between the two stimulants you are on together on the other hand is significantly more likely to be the source."
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,Is this a doctor doctor?
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,Are you seeing a physician (MD/DO) or an PMHNP/NP?
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"I actually think her response and wanting you to continue with someone else is because she knew she fucked up and was scared of being called out or fucking up further. It's a good thing you'll be seeing someone else, IMO, because she seems inexperienced and/or negligent. 

I'm so sorry you went through this. I actually had the exact same symptoms from a different combination of meds, and I also thought I was dying. It was incredibly traumatizing for me because I had no idea what was happening. I even went to the ER and they weren't able to help at all. I thought I was going crazy and suffered from a 5-day long panic attack. I then spent the next year suffering from frequent panic attacks and anxiety. 

Are you feeling better now? Whatever you do - please don't feel guilty or bad in any way. You did absolutely nothing wrong. You were just following your negligent doctor's advice."
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"Oh god! Definitely listen to your body and not your doctor on this one. I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you. Some doctors really don‚Äôt listen. I asked for meds myself and they were hesitant to give me them, wanting to seek therapy to learn strategies to mange‚Ä¶I‚Äôm trained in CBT and specialize in ADHD in my field. They sometimes really don‚Äôt listen."
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"Me:

Major depressive disorder, recurrent, moderate  
Generalized Anxiety Disorder  
ADHD predominantly inattentive type

Meds:

450mg Wellbutrin, 60mg Vyvanse upon waking and 20 mg adderal at noon is what I get prescribed.

Strange shit:

I can go back to sleep easily after the first two drugs, say 1-2 hours after I take them.  With the adderal, I don't think I have ever had better naps than after taking it.

If I am engaged in an activity or at work, I do not get sleepy and I remain focused and engaged.  My blood pressure and heart rate are well within normal limits (no racing heart, no anxiety, single trains of thought (not 1000 at once)  no fidgeting or forgetting things.)

Idk why my body and brain respond that way but my doctor just tells me it is some pretty convincing anecdotal evidence that my brain chemistry is not well balanced, and the drugs are helping find that balance.  We have gone through several combinations and it has taken years.

Without the drugs I do not sleep, including napping,   I am unfocused and depressed.  If I have a serious injury (like post surgery or torn tendon), mild narcotics like hydrocodone  make me bounce off the walls and give me zero chance of sleeping until they wear off.  I suffer from abdominal migraines somehow linked to serotonin excesses in my stomach.  it is fucking hell.

&#x200B;

My point here is that perhaps a new Dr. is exactly what you need.  Tell them you need to find a balance between the right meds /dosages, and your physical and mental responses.  As to the doctor dismissing you like that and telling you to just stop taking everything, in my opinion that was extremely unprofessional and potentially harmful to you.  Instead of feeling ignored and dismissed, maybe try to look at it as a new chance to figure out the right combination to your inner peace and personal satisfaction.

&#x200B;

I wish you well in your search.  It may take a while, and I can't say you will find a fix.  I can say with 100% certainty that you won't find a fix if you don't look."
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,My husband had serotonin syndrome and it was one of the worst experiences of his life. It‚Äôs very dangerous and should be taken seriously! I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you.
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"Adderall and Vyvanse have the same active. In some ways, that‚Äôs like taking extended release aspirin with your aspirin, and you may really want to talk to another doctor."
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"Holy shit, that's a lot. I don't know a single practitioner who would do that without going to extreme lengths to verify that a patient is healthy enough, has no other options, and would benefit. Like I've seen some crazy med combinations in my field, but never a stimulating antidepressant along with 2 actual stimulant meds at those doses when there are already side effects. I know there are cases where it's warranted and safe, but clearly this is not that kind of situation. I'm sorry you went through that!"
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"‚ÄûThousands of dollars‚Äù for a hospital checkup, holy shit. casual sentences like these remind me how good we have it in Europe with universal healthcare. I don‚Äôt pay for my meds, I don‚Äôt pay for going to a doctor."
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"I've taken Wellbutrin and Adderall for 10+ years and it's been very positive for me. My prescribing Dr. is a dual MD and phD and feels this is safe for me and often well tolerated. Cross referenced this with my regular Dr, had her do an EKG and it was normal, for the record. (I was concerned because I read Adderall and my hypothyroid drug can have a bad interaction).

Not sure how much you take but serotonin syndrome is ""Normally""...pretty unlikely with a therapeutic level dose (at least with Wellbutrin and Adderall taken together) but it sounds like you may be right...glad you know about this and and so sorry you had to go through this and I hope you can get better and get a regimen that works!"
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"This seems insane. I can't believe they have you on 2 stimulants.

 In my experience, it's likely the feelings you were having were due to the 2 stimulants being way too strong. 

I also don't understand why your doctor would say just stop taking everything until you see these other doctors instead of reverting to your previously stable medicine regimen. 

All of this just screams a horrible doctor. I'm sorry you had this experience. I would consider lining up a new doctor at a different place if possible."
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,Providers are human and it sounds like she was projecting her insecurities onto you to avoid being responsible for making such a careless decision.
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"Damn....that's one hell of a lot of dopamine stimulation and re-uptake...I've never seen that many at once. Should have just thrown Ritalin in as well for good measure

Edit: I do get the Vyvanse/Adderall combo though.....that late afternoon Vyvanse crash can be pretty brutal."
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"First off, a quick google search of symptoms is never going to be equivalent to multiple degrees and years of experience so despite what you‚Äôve read you should really be taking the doctors advice. Secondly, if you are having heart issues you should be seeing a doctor in person as I‚Äôm not sure what they could really do for you via telephone/video call. Hope you get this sorted soon and wish you all the best."
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,Did everything get really bright and were you dizzy/lightheaded? Because that‚Äôs serotonin syndrome.
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"I had a doctor suggest that when my Vyvanse extended release wears off (fade at 4pm forgetting things and doubling back by 6) that I should take an adderall or 
 Ritalin instant release ~ to get me through my late workday, volunteer programs or meetings...      Yay for zero downtime adhd. lol.     It made sense to me, but given the fact that even coffee reacts to my Vyvanse, and made me tweak. I would be more inclined to try Ritalin.

Just started Adderall XR (10mg to start) because after two months of Vyvanse, I‚Äôve had a serious bout of insomnia, like another friend has experienced.     Still recovering from overnight insomnia (sleeping til 3pm most days) and advised not to take an XR after 3 or 4 PM. I have 5mg instant release for late starts or for boosts after early fades of xr.   

When I would mix coffee and Vyvanse, I would literally tweak. My skin would be crawling and I couldn‚Äôt sit still. My physical nerves were going crazy."
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,Maybe see a real doctor instead of telehealth
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre going through this. I was on Wellbutrin and adderall and wasn‚Äôt even having issues (although I do have other health problems) and my doctor suggested I change the Wellbutrin due to long term cardiac affects of the two together. She‚Äôs the first doctor who‚Äôs mentioned it to me.

I tried Effexor but didn‚Äôt like it so now I‚Äôm on Remeron, which has worked well so far (I‚Äôm about a month in). I should even be able to increase my adderall dosage soon, too, which will be helpful.

I hope the new doctor you are going to see is kinder to you. It‚Äôs hard enough going through what we do without having shitty medical professionals adding to the stress."
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"Yes, it‚Äôs not how you wanted it to go with this (psychiatrist?) But I would imagine you don‚Äôt want her to treat you anymore, do you? Think of it as a gift. You found out really quick you don‚Äôt want her treating you. Move on. And be sure you tell the next doctor what happened with this one when she prescribed X, Y, and Z."
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"Wow, scary!"
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,That sounds like how I was treated when I suffered iatrogenic effects by adhd/depression drugs as well. I lost all trust in them after that
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"Any time my old psychiatrist would increase my vyvanse dosage, I'd get a bit tweaky for a week before my body adjusted.

A few years ago, my psychiatrist had me on 70mg vyvanse, 10mg adderall in the afternoon, and 10mg adderall in the evening. I felt so tweaked off of that combo that I started to taper back down to a much lower dosage. 

Current psychiatrist has me on six different medications (10mg adderall x3, 250mg depakote, 20mg prozac x2, 1mg risperdal, 150mg seroquel, and 150mg wellbutrin) and the only major side effect from it all is that my sleep schedule is massively messed up (I'm also off work for the summer, which definitely plays a part in that). The only time I really feel my heart racing is when I'm laying down (my blood pressure goes way low when I lay down and my heart rate increases).

It sucks that you were treated the way you were, and seeing a different doctor would definitely be a good idea."
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,I'm sorry you went through this. She is an idiot and shouldn't be prescribing medication.
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"Sound like the mixture of stimulants caused you to have a massive panic attack. Ritalin and concerta mix I was on caused the same for me when the 2nd release of the concerta kicked in.  I currently take 2x70mg vyvanse. I take. My 2nd capsule at 12pm so by time the stimulants wear off I'm in bed asleep. I need a stimulant to help me get to sleep. Used to have instant dexamphetamine but didn't last as long.
I do hope your adhd doctor knows vyvanse is pure dexamphetamine once in your blood system and adderall in a mixture of amphetamine salts including dexamphetamine like vyvanse but also levoampheatmine which is in the street amphetamine that gives people the rush and gets there heart pumping quicker. In UK speed aka amphetamines sulphate is just a mixture of dex and levo plus what ever chemicals left over from the mix, then chemicals aside levoampheatmine really doesn't do much for people with adhd I've found from myself and others that have took in the past. Friends who havnt got adhd it's gets them bouncing around with energy, talking fast basically they act like someone with adhd the annoying parts. I found the street amphetamine to nowhere work as well as pure dextro in my adhd stimulants. Now the point I'm getting at is I recon it's the levo part of adderall that gave you the panic attack. Got your heart racing etc. See if you could switch out 5he adderall for instant dexamphetamine I think you will find it works better for you"
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,I have to take propranolol with it in order to tolerate it. Sounds like you may need to also.
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,That sounds absolutely awful. They either need to put you on one or the other with the Wellbutrin. I would recommend just asking for the adderall. Preferably time release. It seems all those stimulants would be overworking your heart. What in the actual fuck is your doctor thinking?!
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,I would highly recommended making an appointment with a psychiatrist. They have more training and experience with psychiatric drugs than your typical PCP.
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"""Just stop taking anything until you see them"". - Sure. How are we supposed to function until then? Not even counting the withdrawal symptoms. 

Maybe give this doctor a 1-start review on all platforms and try to find someone else."
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"She said that because the Vyvanse was helping with my energy and anxiety, she wanted to try to boost the focus part with the Adderall. Yeah, I had a higher heart rate when she put me on 60mg Vyvanse so she backed it down to 30mg, and then at my previous appointment, she put it at 40mg with the 10mg Adderall.

Thank you, I think I'm just taking it to personally like always or being overdramatic because of my depression but I've always felt like no one in my life really listens to me, and so when she also didn't, it made me feel way worse."
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,I'm thinking my heart is just really sensitive to the stimulants because everytime she's upped the dose my heart goes crazy. I'm really hoping I can find something that works for me soon because I can't focus whatsoever and it's affecting my life so much. I just wish my heart wasn't so overdramatic lol
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"Just to clarify, there is value in being on both a long acting and short acting stimulant, in fact the short acting in the afternoon can often help with coming down off meds and make the transition easier. I see comments here suggesting otherwise, but combined therapy is actually pretty helpful, but you need a provider who is really engaged with you, of course."
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"If my current insurance covered Vyvanse I‚Äôd be on all three. Wellbutrin, Adderall XR and IR"
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"The first time I was prescribed Wellbutrin I lasted less than a week because I had a panic attack after not sleeping or eating for like five days.

Now I take both Wellbutrin and Adderall and I'm fine- it works for me. However, it is a flagged combo because it doesn't always go over well. Anyone who is prescribed both should be made aware of possible side effects and have access to their prescriber."
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"That's what I thought too, but she made me feel like it was my own problem"
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"I definitely agree, I won't ever be seeing her again, thankfully."
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,She's a PA
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,It's my MD's PA who has been working on the adhd meds with me.
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"Thank you! I am feeling better but my stress and depression are still in play which makes my anxiety worse. To be honest though, I am still taking the Vyvanse and Wellbutrin because without anything I can't function. I'm hoping to find a new provider soon. I just haven't had any luck nearby so I may have to look online."
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"Oh, I definitely will! I'm hoping I can find someone soon, because I can't function without meds."

I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"I'm so jealous. I tried to use double descent to gain citizenship in Scotland years ago and move there with my family but I didn't realize you had to do that before you hit 18. Otherwise, it's no longer valid."
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,That‚Äôs not insane whatsoever lol.
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"I trust my provider. She has me on cymbalta 60 mg, strattera 80, Vyvanse 70 and a 30 mg afternoon Adderall IR. It's a winning combo for me . It sounds like too much but I feel great."
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,I've been trying to find a psychologist for the longest time and no one is ever accepting new patients.
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,I laughed at this! Might as well try it all at once and see what happens!
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,">First off, a quick google search of symptoms is never going to be equivalent to multiple degrees and years of experience so despite what you‚Äôve read you should really be taking the doctors advice.

Normally I would agree with this, but this sounds like a PHMNP with experience levels less than a med student. The hours an MD goes through to practice independently equal the hours of an additional K-college education while NPs do the hour equivalent of repeating kindergarten."
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"Yes, extremely dizzy with waves of nausea. So lightheaded and disoriented it was an absolutely terrible feeling."
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,It was just a telehealth follow up. I could also see her in office if I wanted to.
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"Thank you so much. I hope so, too! I'm really hoping to find a med combo that works without issue. I really want to be able to focus again!"
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"Wait I‚Äôm on wellbutrin and adderall and have been for years/probably will be indefinitely ‚Äî are there studies on ‚Äúlong term cardiac effects of the two together‚Äù or is it just (entirely reasonable!) speculation due to the fact that they‚Äôre both stimulants? 

(Also I tried and hated Effexor too, hope Remeron is treating you better)"
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"Oh, I'll bring that up and see if it's something I should try. Thank you!"
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"I have no idea. And she knew my heart had issues with stimulants beforehand and that I have occasional arrhythmia on top of that. But I trusted she knew what she was doing, especially since she's supposed to have ADHD experience"
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"Unfortunately, there are none in my area that are accepting new patients. But at this point, making a 4 hour round trip to the next big city may be worth it."
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,You frustration and outrage is valid.  The first job of a practitioner is to listen to their client.
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,Which company is this? That‚Äôs insane prescription combinations. Nobody in their right mind would do that
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"I definitely understand that especially when there‚Äôs already those internal feelings of it trusting yourself or not being listened to. That drug combo doesn‚Äôt sound right. If vyvanse is working, Adderall shouldn‚Äôt be added. They don‚Äôt even know how you‚Äôd react to the Adderall or if it would boost the focus part. In my mind, if you still are struggling with focus, the next step would be to increase the vyvanse dose. Get a second opinion"
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,Yikes. I‚Äôve never taken Vyvanse but I take 150 Wellbutrin and if I have coffee too I can only do 5mg adderall at a time without spiking my blood pressure.
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"I had to stop taking stimulants because my heart rate would spike up and stay up and as soon as I mentioned it my psychiatrist immediately recommended either trying a different stimulant or backing off on dose until finally we moved to nonstimulant strattera. Strattera almost completely eliminated my anxiety and I feel so much less stress. It‚Äôs not as great for my focus as adderall was but it does still help and I‚Äôm not a ball of anxiety and then stressed about my heart rate on top of it. 

Basically, there are still options for you even if stimulants hit your heart too hard. Also maybe check in with yourself on this provider and see how you feel with the one they transferred you to and see if you like them better. Sometimes you aren‚Äôt a good fit for a provider or they aren‚Äôt a good fit for you, and that‚Äôs ok. It‚Äôs ok to change providers because you don‚Äôt feel like they‚Äôre a good fit for you."
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"Yeah, I agree. I feel like if she listened to me beforehand this wouldn't have happened because my heart was already very elevated on the 60mg Vyvanse she had me on, but I figured she would know better than me with adding a new med. But I definitely want to try to find a psychologist with ADHD experience to prescribe me my meds instead. I guess I just have a very sensitive heart because my heart has abnormal palpitations every now and then."
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"Okay. I won't dunk on her schooling because PAs are generally at least more knowledgeable than NPs. There's an idea that mental health care is easy that I really have issue with. I really don't like any of the way she treated you. I know it's difficult to try to find the right provider for you (hopefully MD/DO) especially since we are in need of so many more specialist. This might be something you could do in a stepwise manner while still staying with the current group until you have something lined up. 

Maybe look first at what providers you have listed in your area from your insurance website, pick one with good reviews, and call to see what wait times are like. Schedule an appointment, even if it's months away. You can always cancel, but it's there, getting closer as an option. From there you can call other practices as needed to look for earlier dates, but you can also rest easy knowing you haven't fired your current provider and you have a fall back for later. 

Best of luck. Remember, even when you don't perceive that you've  ""accomplished"" what you wanted for the day, consider how much energy you have spent just coping with your brain and the not correct med dose."
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,I know what you mean. I don't function well without meds either. Hang in there my friend! ‚ù§Ô∏è
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"I should have said ‚Äúpotential‚Äù long term effects, sorry. I haven‚Äôt seen studies of the two together, but from what my doctor said it‚Äôs a bit of both. 

In my case it was an abundance of caution thing due to my other issues and family history. I was at kind of a plateau with the Wellbutrin, anyway, so I was fine with trying something else.

If it‚Äôs working for you and you‚Äôre not experiencing symptoms I wouldn‚Äôt stress too much about it. It‚Äôs one of those ‚Äúif the reward outweighs the risk‚Äù things. Maybe getting cardiac testing every couple of years just to make sure no damage is being done would be a good idea.

And thanks! So far, so good!"
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,The adderall alone should do everything you need it will give you energy and help maintaining focus. Seems redundant to have you on both.
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"Thank you, stranger. I appreciate you."
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"It‚Äôs not outrageous‚Ä¶ I take 300 mg Wellbutrin and 30 mg Vyvanse, and a 10 mg tablet of Adderall later in the day if needed. I have no issues. Everyone tolerates medications differently."
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"One Peak Medical, they have a bunch of branches here in Oregon"
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,Are you a medical professional? It‚Äôs really not a ridiculous combination.
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,i‚Äôm on 50mg of Vyvanse in the AM and 10mg of Adderall IR in the late afternoon as prescribed by my dr. no Wellbutrin but also Zoloft and the combo is perfect for me.. not an unreasonable combo
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"It‚Äôs super common to be on a long acting stimulant combined with an instant release stimulant (or more than one!) to lengthen the duration of focus or amplify it‚Ä¶ also common to be prescribed either Wellbutrin or Strattera in conjunction with stimulant meds, it‚Äôs called ‚Äúcombination therapy‚Äù. I‚Äôm currently on 300mg Wellbutrin, 70mg Vyvanse and 10mg Adderall in the afternoon, I just tapered all the way off Strattera but I‚Äôm finding my motivation has plummeted since I dropped that med. Adderall giving me a depressive crash, so I plan to ask my provider if I can switch to a different IR like Zenzedi (dex), but the Vyvanse/Adderall combo is very popular and seems to work for a lot of other people."
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,Thank you. I've been trying to find a psychologist to prescribe me meds instead for a while now but no one is accepting new patients where I live.
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"It's common to prescribe a booster with Vyvanse, like Zenzedi (Dextroamphetamine), as Vyvanse may not last all day for some people (like me), despite being an extended release.

IMO, the issues were:

- 1st, the doctor didn't take into consideration OP feelings and side effects they were experiencing.

- 2nd, they should have prescribed a lower dosage in case OP was sensitive to it. Let's say, start with 2,5mg of Adderall and see how it goes. If it's not effective, then 5mg. Otherwise, 7,5mg. Increasing slowly helps to assess the effectiveness and possible side effects. 

Also, change/increase one thing at a time. If you're changing the dosage of Vyvanse or Wellbutrin, see how it goes first. If you add/change a lot of variables at the same time, it's really hard to know what caused what."
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"Thank you! Maybe Strattera would be a good option for me, I'll mention it to the new provider."
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"Thank you, that's good advice!"
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"Yeah, she never tried switching meds, just started adding new ones into the mix."
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"Whoa, seriously? I just started going to them. I have a follow-up to sort out my meds tomorrow... Hope it's not the same person you saw. She sounds like a nightmare."
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,try Sokya telehealth since you are in Oregon if you are looking for someone new.
I was put on Vyvanse and Adderall while already being on Wellbutrin and my provider completely disregarded my experience,"It actually took two tries for strattera to work out for me. The first time we took it a bit too fast for my body and I had horrible constipation. The second time around I stayed on the lower doses for 1 month each and now I‚Äôm on the maintenance dose with no constipation issues and I honestly feel so good. Its honestly amazing how I don‚Äôt feel just stressed and anxious all the time and how freeing that is.

Good luck!"

Why is my Wellbutrin and Adderall Combo making me Sleepy and Unfocused?,"I would bring this up to your doctor immediately. Losing time is very abnormal and what you're describing seems way beyond the typical ""stimulants calm the ADHD brain"" explanation.  This is also a contradictory reaction to what you'd expect with a Wellbutrin/Adderall combo

Wellbutrin actually inhibits the enzyme that breaks down Adderall, so it increases the level of amphetamine in your blood. I take both, and the Wellbutrin makes the Adderall more stimulating than it would be if I took it alone."
Why is my Wellbutrin and Adderall Combo making me Sleepy and Unfocused?,"I don‚Äôt take mine at the same time. That might help. I take my first dose of adderall at 8 am. (10mg IR) , Wellbutrin 300 around 10am. Second dose of adderall of 5 mg IR at 1pm. EDIT: I‚Äôm not a doctor- this is just what works for me*****"
Why is my Wellbutrin and Adderall Combo making me Sleepy and Unfocused?,Adderall did that to me without Wellbutrin and with Wellbutrin.
Why is my Wellbutrin and Adderall Combo making me Sleepy and Unfocused?,"Yes, She warned me about possible jitteriness, anxiety and high blood pressure with the interaction. I wrote her on my portal and she writes back that she thinks I need to ""get used to the medication"" and having a more ""slow mind"" and told me we can adjust at the next appointment. I don't think she knows much about it so that's why I came here lol"
Why is my Wellbutrin and Adderall Combo making me Sleepy and Unfocused?,Thanks! I will try that. Are you taking Wellbutrin SR or XL?
Why is my Wellbutrin and Adderall Combo making me Sleepy and Unfocused?,Did you switch to Ritalin? Or did all the stimulants have a paradoxical reaction for you?
Why is my Wellbutrin and Adderall Combo making me Sleepy and Unfocused?,"XL. I also drink coffee right when I wake up but only half a cup and never within an an hour of the adderall as I‚Äôve been reading on the sub it can dull its effects. I also have a high protein breakfast right before the adderall dosage. Greek yogurt, eggs, peanut butter, protein shake etc. made a big difference. But talk to your doctor for sure! I also told my doctor these things and he said to stick to not taking Wellbutrin at the Same time."
Why is my Wellbutrin and Adderall Combo making me Sleepy and Unfocused?,"I tried Ritalin, but yes - I have that reaction to all the stimulants. I only take Wellbutrin.

Edit: but don‚Äôt be discouraged - we all have different chemistry! You really may find one that works for you."
Why is my Wellbutrin and Adderall Combo making me Sleepy and Unfocused?,"Thanks. I take the ER Adderall about an hour before I get up so it doesn't kick in for about 2 hours for me and makes me tired till it wears off about 10-12 hrs later. So not sure taking the wellbutrin SR 2 hrs behind it will work as well as Adderall IR might, but I will give it a try. Coffee is barely saving my ass right now with the tiredness lol."

Anyone tried Wellbutrin and zoloft combo for treating adhd and associated depression? ,"Response to medication varies from person to person too much to get any meaningful anecdotes. It may work for some people and also may not. It might work for you, or it might not. To my knowledge, Wellbutrin can be prescribed off label for ADHD, but is mainly used for depression, and can sometimes help with anxiety, but is not approved for treatment of anxiety. While some people may have success pairing Wellbutrin with an SSRI like zoloft, definitely just ask your provider about it."

It took 7 years of trial and error (and other health issues) to figure this out, but I feel so much better now it's wild. 

Once we switched from SSRI to SNRI it was night and day.


Good luck!"
Anyone tried Wellbutrin and zoloft combo for treating adhd and associated depression? ,Wellbutrin gets paired with a lot. It normally helps because it's for adhd and depression. So you're happy and concentrated.

Anyone tried Wellbutrin and zoloft combo for treating adhd and associated depression? ,"Me! I wasn‚Äôt a big fan and just end up with Zoloft then switched to Lexapro and strattera then back to Zoloft with a stimulant. It does work, but the stimulant and Zoloft works better for me. But everyone is different, so you may thrive on the combo."

Probably good for someone, didn't do much for me."
Anyone tried Wellbutrin and zoloft combo for treating adhd and associated depression? ,"I tried lexapro and Wellbutrin, and later Zoloft on its own. Wellbutrin didn‚Äôt do much of anything for me, good or bad. Apparently that‚Äôs not uncommon but doesn‚Äôt mean much, they don‚Äôt know exactly how it works or who it‚Äôs more likely to help. Zoloft I had too many side effects. I later switched to Cymbalta. 

Just of note, all of this was when I was only diagnosed with depression (but exhibiting adhd symptoms). I‚Äôm hoping to get an adhd dx soon"

Anyone tried Wellbutrin and zoloft combo for treating adhd and associated depression? ,"Agreed. My own magical combo ended up being a mood stabilizer and Wellbutrin, but a doctor would be best to advise you, as you may want to discuss potential side effects of starting one or having both. You can of course come with questions, but I would keep an open mind before getting fixated on a solution you heard about."
Anyone tried Wellbutrin and zoloft combo for treating adhd and associated depression? ,I appreciate this but most doctors are clueless these days and don‚Äôt care to put time into helping their patients. I am trying to figure out what to do and guide my doctor and I‚Äôve tried many things.

Anyone tried Wellbutrin and zoloft combo for treating adhd and associated depression? ,Can I ask what dose you take of both?
Anyone tried Wellbutrin and zoloft combo for treating adhd and associated depression? ,Understandable. The point still stands that medication varies for everyone. You might even have to try different SSRIs as well.

Anyone tried Wellbutrin and zoloft combo for treating adhd and associated depression? ,"Yup! I started Zoloft for that reason when on Wellbutrin and having panic attacks. Zoloft is pretty strong SSRI, and it‚Äôs hard to go off of. Zoloft was designed to always treat PTSD."

Wellbutrin AND Adderall Experiences,"Wellbutrin made my mornings way better(clarity, awareness) before my xr stimulant kicked in. 

it also made me so to emotional I could no longer keep my mouth shut at work so there's that too"
Wellbutrin AND Adderall Experiences,"Wellbutrin has been life changing for me. Was having bad anxiety, depression, and PTSD.

Doesn't make my troubles disappear but it made a massive improvement."
Wellbutrin AND Adderall Experiences,"I switched to Wellbutrin during the worst of the adderall shortage because I was sick of chasing pills over 5 pharmacies every 30 days. I found that I was lot more motivated to do stuff but my focus was trash.  

So I recently switched to a psychiatrist and he put me back on Adderall and kept up my Wellbutrin rx too. So far so good for me‚Äîvery few if any physical side effects, no more negative self talk, decent motivation, and decent focus."
Wellbutrin AND Adderall Experiences,"I've taken both simultaneously. Wellbutrin did help to improve my mood, but I was ultimately unable to tolerate the side effects."
Wellbutrin AND Adderall Experiences,"both have worked for me for their respective purposes, but *goddammit* I am horny *at*. *all*. *times* now."
Wellbutrin AND Adderall Experiences,"I will second the increase in sex drive. It‚Äôs through the goddam roof. Lmao. Honestly a little refreshing after years of it being @ 0% while on SSRIs.

Also prepare for an increase of anxiety for the first couple of weeks, and with any subsequent dosage increases, but ultimately manageable because you know where the anxiousness is coming from."
Wellbutrin AND Adderall Experiences,"I used to take both! I noticed though that my anxiety was still bad and after talking with my doctor, learned that Wellbutrin doesn‚Äôt treat anxiety. It only treats depression. I ended up switching to Prozac and saw a MAJOR improvement in my mood and anxiety so that‚Äôs what I take now with my adderall."
Wellbutrin AND Adderall Experiences,"i tried wellbutrin before i ever knew i had ADHD! i think it was the wrong drug to try *at the time*. 

since wellbutrin is an NDRI it can be somewhat activating, not to the extent that adderall or other stimulants are, but still. given my unmanaged GAD/PTSD/panic attacks, extra stimulation was not what i needed. wellbutrin worsened my anxiety a bunch and gave me panic attacks way more frequently than i was currently experiencing them. 

that said, my anxiety is now **much** better managed. i‚Äôm in counselling and on three other meds for anxiety/depression/PTSD/panic/all that. i think if i were to go on wellbutrin now, it would actually help with my executive functioning more and help boost my vyvanse which i take for my ADHD. 

wellbutrin is also an inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vivo, and since amphetamines are metabolized by CYP2D6, wellbutrin can *potentiate* the effects of amphetamine, in theory. there‚Äôs not a lot of research on this to be honest so it‚Äôs all theoretical. but one plus is you *may* notice your adderall working just that little bit better.

also something to keep in mind is that wellbutrin isn‚Äôt approved to treat anxiety disorders like GAD, and in some cases (like mine), can worsen it. but in some cases it improves anxiety, so, yknow, kinda just gotta find out for yourself.

good luck OP. wishing you success and all the best üíóüíó"
Wellbutrin AND Adderall Experiences,"Life changing. For me the combination of quitting alcohol plus adderall and Wellbutrin had given me hope that I actually am capable of leading a satisfying and functioning life. 

Previously I was miserable and just trudging through life. Even small normal tasks were akin to moving a giant pile of rocks from one side of the street to the other. Everything felt both pointless and difficult. 

It‚Äôs not a cure all and I am not perfect. But I describe it like this: the drug combination changes my perception from ‚ÄúI actually can not do a task‚Äù (executive dysfunction), to ‚Äúhey wait, I actually can accomplish this task but I am choosing to procrastinate.‚Äù  It‚Äôs hard to explain. But I have found this combo life altering."
Wellbutrin AND Adderall Experiences,"I'm taking both. I feel like the Wellbutrin I could take it or leave it and be fine either way--I'm on other meds for depression/anxiety at the moment as well. 

Only noticeable side-effect is that my essential tremor is worse in general, especially when I'm hungry, but that's about it."
Wellbutrin AND Adderall Experiences,"I've been taking Strattera for the last two years. Strattera is functionally very close to Wellbutrin. It has a somewhat different composition, but very similar effect on the norepinephrine.


At my most recent annual checkup last month I added a prescription for Adderall immediate release and it has helped. It's a very low dose (5 mg) and I split it in half between the morning and the afternoon.


So far so good."
Wellbutrin AND Adderall Experiences,"Wellbutrin might make anxiety worse. It might increase your energy/drive tho. If your depression is a ""I dont wanna do anything"" kind of depression it might help."
Wellbutrin AND Adderall Experiences,"Realized I need to comment my experiences:

First day, I felt very little. My psych had advised I take the Wellbutrin first, then wait an hour before taking adderall to understand side effects. That screwed me over, I had forgotten that taking my adderall late usually throws a wrench in my day.

Second day, today, I think I‚Äôm feeling it more. It‚Äôs been a bit easier to focus and I‚Äôm a little more motivated overall. Decreased appetite for sure, but I‚Äôm not really complaining there. Headaches, but that could be stress. Unsure at this time. Still fucking depressed/ruminating when I‚Äôm not actively doing work, but hopefully as the weeks go on, I‚Äôll feel the effects a bit more."
Wellbutrin AND Adderall Experiences,I feel like i could have written this first paragraph!! I just started wellbutrin today and have really high hopes it will work well in combo with adderall ‚ù§Ô∏è
Wellbutrin AND Adderall Experiences,"mmmm this is a hard question, I guess more dull, and suicidal¬†"
Wellbutrin AND Adderall Experiences,I started with Wellbutrin. It has been a great asset for my chronic fatigue and mid day emotional slump.
Wellbutrin AND Adderall Experiences,"I had a terrible allergic reaction to Wellbutrin 12 hours after my first dose. It's a lesser-known side effect and not very common. My arms and legs were burning hot to the touch and as itchy as they've ever been. Unfortunately, I didn't get to take the two together for long enough to benefit in any way for the Wellbutrin. Adderall has been a godsend for me though."
Wellbutrin AND Adderall Experiences,I've taken them both at the same time before.  I didn't notice any difference when I added Wellbutrin to my Adderall.
Wellbutrin AND Adderall Experiences,"I‚Äôm actually seeing my Dr. in a few hours to discuss my experience with this combination and, hopefully, find an alternative to test. I‚Äôm Inattentive Type, 33M (diagnosed just over a year ago.)

Overall, my experience with these two has been amazing. I started taking Adderall (30mg) last year and it was a game-changer, primarily in my ability to be more proactive throughout the entirety of the day. We tried higher and lower doses but ultimately landed where I‚Äôve been for a while.

I felt as though my depression & focus were still lacking quite a bit, so my Dr. added Wellbutrin to the mix. I noticed immediate improvements, as well as a gnarly side effect of nightmares. I don‚Äôt know where the line between nightmares and night terrors is, but as someone who went from never dreaming to vivid sad, ugly, and straight up effed up ones it has been tough. I took a break from just the Wellbutrin for a couple weeks and realized just how much it added to/complemented the Adderall and started it up again a week or so ago.

Anyways, that‚Äôs my experience after about 2-3 months. I‚Äôm hoping to try another dosage of either/or OR to try something new to target my primary ADHD symptoms and Depression.

I think I read a comment that OP was doing well after a couple months and that‚Äôs awesome! I‚Äôd say I really do feel great overall but would like to see if there are side effects slightly less severe. I‚Äôm open to suggestions and will try and come back with what we try + results at a later date!"
Wellbutrin AND Adderall Experiences,I've heard good things but both times I tried it I throw up within 20 minutes. :-(
Wellbutrin AND Adderall Experiences,I cant even imagine what life would be like without negative self talk. I started wellbutrin this am. Hoping to have similar results!!
Wellbutrin AND Adderall Experiences,"Ooh, what side effects did you have?"
Wellbutrin AND Adderall Experiences,When did you see an increase? I‚Äôm 2 weeks in and hoping for this side effect!
Wellbutrin AND Adderall Experiences,Ha! SSRIs completely destroyed my libido years ago and I never really felt the need to do anything about it. Would be kinda nice to have that back tbh
Wellbutrin AND Adderall Experiences,"After being on it for 4 months at this point, I can say it's been life-changing. Haven't had any noticeable side effects so far. I hope it works well for you too üíö"
Wellbutrin AND Adderall Experiences,"The amazing part for me was I became completely uninterested. I used to fall into negative self talk almost like a drug‚ÄîI was proud of how well I knew I was garbage.  

I tried it once after I started medicating and thought, man, this is boring.  And never went back.  Here‚Äôs hoping it works for you!"
Wellbutrin AND Adderall Experiences,"Anxiety, appetite loss, and elevated blood pressure (probably from the anxiety).

The appetite loss was manageable - just gotta remember to eat - but the anxiety was too much for me.

It can have some other side effects too when you first start taking it but they mostly went away for me after like 4 weeks."
Wellbutrin AND Adderall Experiences,"I feel like ADHD and possible bipolar factor into me being predisposed to it to begin with, but Wellbutrin and Adderall have definitely exacerbated into extreme hypersexuality for me."

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Yes!!!! Until I got back on medication it was like there was this feral animal sitting at the back of my brain - for years! 

My first day back on meds I sat down to eat dinner. The little beasty started to rear it‚Äôs ugly head and I simply looked at the food and said ‚Äúnope, not today‚Äù - the compulsion was gone. I only ate what I needed. I had all the will power in the world suddenly! 

It was exhilarating! 

And tragic. 

I cried. For all the years I had immersed myself in shame and loathing."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",I was eating for dopamine for over 40 years before I figured this out.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",My ADHD kid is a total binge eater. It gets your brain the dopamine fix it craves.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Yes. Vyvanse is for adhd and is also approved for binge eating disorder.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","I'd believe that. I've had weight problems my whole life, and I'm definitely always thinking about my next meal.

Also, to further commiserate, part of my job is working from home, and we have 2 kids. Ever since the 2nd baby showed up, not much work has gotten done. I've had a lot more upset clients than usual this year.

Existing is difficult."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","I actually discovered this about myself a few months ago!  I realized that Vyvanse staved off hunger pretty well for me but I noticed that on days that I did not take it I was basically just Kirby-ing everything. It's like a bottomless stomach for whatever reason when I'm off medication, can't seem to feel or get full."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","There's a Japanese word Âè£ÂØÇ„Åó„ÅÑ(kuchisabishii) that literally translates to ""Lonely mouth"" and is basically that you eat because of boredom and I think I do that a lot because of my ADHD. Chewing gum can help at times but doesn't really scratch the itch."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Could this be the reason why everytime I volunteer at a festival - where the really intense rhythm and relatively high stakes give me the biggest dopamine hit ever - I suddenly stop being hungry all the time and happily live off coffee and a couple of fries for days on end?
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Oh man do I feel you. Mine‚Äôs 3 now and just getting laundry done feels like I nailed the goddamned moon landing. Get done what you can and give that baby all the attention you can :)
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Lol, yeah, it is 

Before I was diagnosed at 22, I actually had ‚ÄúBinge eating disorder‚Äù due to feeling misunderstood and depressed all the time (I was eating to generate dopamine). Once I got my diagnosis and found the right medication, I felt in control of my life for the first time, and the depression mostly went away (along with the eating disorder). I lost 100lbs in a year, and became a much healthier person overall, and have maintained that lifestyle to present day (now in my mid 30s).

‚Ä¶ Imagine my surprise when *earlier this year* I‚Äôm listening to a podcast about ADHD in the car one day and they start talking about my *exact* eating habits from about 4th grade until after college‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt know I had an eating disorder for most of my life until over a decade after I had overcome it

Life is wild"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Bro... wait till you find our *everything* is the adhd
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Yeah it definitely can be. You bet your ass you feel stimulated as hell taking that first bite into a cookie!
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","It may also help to change your perspective of ‚Äúgetting things done‚Äù. Dishes, laundry, yard work, etc. are just examples you can physically SEE at the end of the day, but keeping a toddler alive all day is a LOT. Even just the sitting there interacting and listening without losing your mind IS doing something. Babies and toddlers are needy af by nature. All that (seemingly endless) attention and engagement is crucial to their development at this stage. So if find yourself going to bed with B.O. on dirty sheets w/ Wheels on the Bus stuck in your head, rest assured you did in fact, get shit done that day."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","1. Your not a useless sack of potatoes: you a human being with an innate worth. You don't have to be riddled with guilt, or shame, or anxiety; but its totally valid have those feelings. (AKA, you can feel them; just doesn't make sense to use them as self punishment in the case you are doing that.)
2. Good job on caring for your toddler. That's a pretty innately hard thing to do, even if you willingly signed up for it. Don't underplay this part if you do. I see a lot of parents make this mistake.
3. Yes, ADHD and binge eating are pretty common. And yes, you have a total right to feel shocked, blindsided, or any other feeling related to hearing this; but just because you didn't know, doesn't reflect on your capabilities or value as a human being. You didn't exactly come into this world with a ""ADHD human"" manual and decided to trash it/ignore it.
4. I really hope you have someone in your life to remind you during moments like this that again, your worth innate human value, love, and compassion. As far as I know, your not a shit human being and binge or no binge doesn't determine that. If you don't have anyone to say that to you at the current moment, then I hope this message coming from an internet stranger will stick with you."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",I got on Wellbutrin and the weight is flying off.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","This is my most and least favourite thing about discovering ADHD symptoms, it explains so much and yet it *causes so much*..."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","ADHD is present in about 5% of the population... But over 40% of the patients who get bariatric surgery have an existing ADHD diagnosis.

It's a known thing."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Uhhh what now?!! Thank you for posting this because I had NO IDEA that my binge eating was related to my adhd
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Food is the easiest and most acceptable source of dopamine
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","When I started medication at 42, I realized I had been hyperfocusing on food and eating.

It was so confusing before that. I'd done so much ""work"" on me. It seemed like I was emotional eating, but like‚Ä¶I didn't feel upset? So I couldn't understand what emotion I was trying to soothe.

Then when I started Adderall (I take Vyvanse now), all the sudden my brain was quiet.

And suddenly I realized that I had been living with a constant background music of ""I like eating. What food is in the house? What food could I buy? What could I eat right now? How many different ways could I prepare this?"" etc. I was eating all the time, because my brain was bombarding me with thoughts of eating.

And when it shut up, it was easy for me to not think about food until I got hungry. What a fucking difference!"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Having this realization blew my mind. I had to go off my Vyvanse after losing insurance coverage, and one of the reasons I‚Äôm most excited to get back on it is that I was able to manage my health and eating habits soooo much better."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","As soon as I jumped on Elvanse (Vyvanse in EU) my binge-eating went away, and I could stop haring myself each day for overeating in the evenings. Maintaining a healthy weight is also not a problem for me any more."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Wait, what?!? So the reason why I go days without eating and then inhaling everything in sight is ADHD?!? Do you have any idea how much more compassion I have for myself now? Holy shitsnacks."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Vyvanse is an ADHD drug and it is also prescribed for binge eating disorder.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Reading this as I sit here binge eating üôÉ unfortunately, I also have severe body dysmorphia, so I get into binge, purge, restrict cycles constantly. 

Advice on how to stop binge eating?"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Yupppp so far vyvanse has helped me lose 16-17 kg in about 9 months, it's amazing. When I don't take it or when it wears off I just want to eat all the time. Didn't realize how bad it's been until I tried medication and then skipped it one day."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Vyvanse helps with that
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",I lost 25 pounds once I started guanfacine and started to remember to eat 3 times a day. My binge eating stopped so suddenly I didn't even notice the transformation.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","2nd time mom here! my son is 10 and my daughter is 10 months old. when my son was born i swear i feel like a total mental change happened. not at the time of course but looking back. i weighed 270 pounds, i couldn‚Äôt hold a job down, i had severe anxiety and depression, i had ruined most of my relationships, and i was dealing with severe postpartum. i ended up rolling through life. i got divorced. finally had a job (still struggled with being late and making it to work but i kept it for a few years). 10 years later i had my daughter with a different partner who was diagnosed with adhd as a child. he got back on his medication and urged me to to talk with someone because what i was feeling felt familiar to him with his ADHD. i went and got diagnosed 5 days ago at 32 years old. i started medication. they told me my pregnancies probably made symptoms worse. that if i had any symptoms prior, pregnancy just amped them up. the medication has helped. so much so that i feel like my life changed overnight. things suddenly made a lot of sense.

i‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôve got some answers. having something that helps you know that you aren‚Äôt broken or messed up really feels like a huge weight lifted."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",I didn't learn this until this year. 46 years later. Tirzepatide (Mounjaro) + Vyvanse has kept the binge monster at bay.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Y‚Äôall just reminded me I need to go binge eat again
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Oh‚Ä¶ my god‚Ä¶ you know I always chalked it up to being a comfort eater (and I probably still am) but I never once considered it could have been me looking for a dopamine hit too‚Ä¶
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",After starting Vyvanse I realised I don‚Äôt know how to eat for nutrition. I‚Äôve been eating for dopamine my entire life.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",I've never heard that these two things are related. Can you share a link to where you saw this? I'm quite curious!
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Just for diagnosed and made this connection at 37! Lately my solution to wanting something sweet is a lollipop. I can eat them slowly, keeps my mouth busy but not a ton of calories or sugar in total"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","I‚Äôm not pregnant and LOVE BINGE EATING!!!!

Eg. I grow a few things and one thing is a few bananas - when they ripen a whole bunch can ripen at once = too many bananas. I bought a dehydrator to be able to save them‚Ä¶ 
Bad idea! My ADHD will have me binge eat maybe 10 bananas worth of dried bananas a day!"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","meds have helped me a lot, though still not always. If I'm going through any kind of change from my regular routine, it will throw me right back to eating for dopamine/self-regulation. Currently in a bout of it now while medicated and it sucks. 

I am 100% an addict. I will hide delicious food, and then go into the closet or place where I won't be seen and enjoy it in privacy. I get such a thrill out of this, and can't seem to stop. I hate eating in front of others, and would always prefer to eat in secrecy/stealth-mode because I get way more dopamine this way."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Yeah it turns out eating to the point you feel unwell and almost shit yourself is not normal and you're not just being a horrible person...

I want to give teenage me so much comfort."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","I used to be the kind of person that couldn‚Äôt just have one biscuit or whatever; it would be the entire pack. I‚Äôm still compelled to buy myself treats, but I‚Äôve literally had packets of biscuits/sweets in the cupboard for weeks now because the knowledge of their existence in the house doesn‚Äôt compel me to eat them.

I still have my appetite, massively so, but elvanse is allowing me to maintain a healthier attitude to food, and control my intake so I‚Äôm very gradually deflating. Which is ideal for someone who has been consistently 10% fatter than healthy for a long time."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Vyvanse is approved for Binge eating. No surprise it‚Äôs an ADHD drug then.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",welcome to the club
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",My binge shopping sure was
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Yep! I‚Äôve been a binge eater as long as I can remember. Vyvanse has helped some. I still have to remind myself to not over do it when I eat, and my medications make it easier for me to say no. Although I do feel the hunger pains late in the day when my meds wear off and I feel the need to stuff my face"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",When I'm on meds I eat significantly less . It's kind of crazy
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",My tongue is raw thanks to my fixation on blue berry baby bottle pops.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","I‚Äôm 33 and just figured this out like a year ago. I‚Äôm definitely more aware of my eating habits‚Ä¶binge or no binge‚Ä¶but it sure hasn‚Äôt made trying to eat ‚Äúnormal‚Äù any easier. Normal like intuitive eating. That‚Äôs my goal.

Even on meds I struggle with overeating sometimes."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Food = dopamine lol

The second you swallow that dopamine is gone so more food then more food until you‚Äôre too physically uncomfortable 

At least that‚Äôs how it works for me lol"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Yup...I only got diagnosed adhd because I went to a dietitian about my f$*$&Ed up eating... and she was like ""yah... there is some other stuff at play here, please call this doctor"". When I met the doctor she was like ""how the hell has no one diagnosed this before."" She was kind...but also kind of pointed out that I am a mess..."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","I finally found the right meds that help with my binge eating. I have struggled with it all my life. Was able to keep weight off until mid 20s. Now at 30 I am desperately trying to loose weight. It‚Äôs a battle. Best thing, keep hands busy with things you don‚Äôt want dirty with food. I Create strict rules. Only eat at a table 
No food while reading, working or TV 
No food in the car while driving
Time strict meals (I keep mine slightly flexible and include snacks)"

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",I feel for you!!! When I was pregant I had to eat a cheese stick every couple of hours or I felt like I was going to die! I went from 130 to 190. Once she was born I could not control the urges and had to fight hard to get from 170 to 150. My brain need constant caloric imput to be able to handle the sensory overload. The only thing that has made me feel better was going on birth control and having my hormones regulated + my ADHD meds being taken in the afternoon.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","On the weekends, I don't take my medicine usually and I eat SO MUCH! During the week, I don't even want to look at food. I'm convinced if I was to stop medication all together, I would gain so much weight."

I‚Äôve never felt so seen."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Here are the things I do to avoid my ADHD attributed binge eating: 

1. Drink adequate water. Signals for hunger and dehydration can get crossed in our brain. So I try to stay hydrated. 

2. Eat adequate protein at least 100g every day. It helps keep make you full and stay full so that you don‚Äôt get hungry as often. Making sure you are eating ADEQUATELY helps curb binge eating because it makes it easier to control your urges. It‚Äôs hard to hold yourself back from binge eating if you haven‚Äôt gotten enough calories throughout the day and are starving. Protein helps this too. 

3. Self care. I make sure I take care of me! This could be making time to - read a book, knit, take a bath, get a pedicure, get a massage, go for a walk, watch a favorite TV show, schedule a doctors appt that I have been putting off, going out to have a favorite treat (going to an ice cream shop and sitting there with a small serving of ice cream, for example), exercise, etc. I could go on, but ultimately do something that makes you happy. Gives you dopamine elsewhere. 

4. Complete a task on my to do list. Gives you dopamine! And sometimes starting a task gives you the momentum to do another task. 

5. Making sure my biggest binge foods aren‚Äôt in my house. When they are there it‚Äôs way too easy to eat them mindlessly. If I really get a craving I can go buy a controlled amount and either bring a serving size bag home OR go eat it in a different location. Changing up the habit also helps because so often we correlate bingeing with a specific habit. For example I love to binge on the couch watching TV. So I try to avoid eating on the couch watching TV, I will instead sit in the chair and read a book. 

6. Be sure to allow yourself treats, sometimes even before you start to crave them. Allowing yourself your favorite foods in moderation before you get to a ‚Äúdesperate‚Äù level will help you maintain control while you eat it. 

I have worked on this issue for a very long time. And I‚Äôm not perfect at it, but I used a coach to help me, and it‚Äôs given me so many tools to use to work through it and improve myself."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm) im undiagnosed, but im so sure i have adhd, from the being a super energetic kid, to screeching when i had to do homework when i was little, to extreme procrastination and guilt( plus more etc..) I have a terrible relationship with food for as long as i remembered. i associated it with every emotion especially boredom or to kill time. I told my doctors what was wrong and i couldn't help it no matter how much i tried. The solution was always diet and exercise then you'll be less bored or ""busy"" recently was diagnosed with severe depression from losses and pressure from college. Even though its passed as i feel way better i told my psychiatrist that im done with taking the pills and that i want to talk about adhd, they are making wait a year to be on the pill just to make sure its not depression. And about my weight and eatting disorder they recommended healthy eatting...and vitamins like if that solution wasn't given to me thousands or times. But if i had any questions about depression make a appointment.."

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","I dopamine eat too, it's really frustrating. It's like I go on autopilot, no rational thought is getting me out of the snack cupboard.

I've realised I probably won't learn how to stop for a while, so I only keep light popcorn, veggies and dark chocolate in the house. Anything low calorie or things that are difficult to eat a lot of work well.

There's only so much of each that I can binge before I get too full (and sick in the case of dark chocolate).

I can not keep crisps or unfrozen bread in the house otherwise I turn into a locust."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","I‚Äôm 38F and just diagnosed with ADHD. I had classic signs as a kid but because I didn‚Äôt get bad grades, it was overlooked (got into too much trouble for talking in class). I‚Äôve been overweight my entire life. I‚Äôve always struggled with sweets. I had accepted I have a food addiction. But after starting meds, I haven‚Äôt been overeating. I eat but I make much healthier choices. Usually, I crave McD‚Äôs or Taco Bell and peanut butter cups all the time. Now, they don‚Äôt seem appealing at all. Will be saving this article and reading more."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Yeah: Because our brains can't generate the dopamine we need (In normal brains dopamine is generated in a drip feed style, like an IV drip or a filter coffee machine) We tend to either over eat to get the dopamine we need or become addicted to coffee.

The type of dopamine we get from those is shorter lived so we eat or drink more than we should.

That or we learn to live off adrenaline, which is just terrible for us and is usually why people with ADHD tend to die earlier than most people."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Thank god for seeing this honestly...every post that's like 'haha, I forget to eat! Meds, right?' and I'm sitting here, after bariatric surgery, struggling to stay under 330 lbs...

It's not even that I eat a lot, I just constantly am eating if my meds have worn off.  It takes so much willpower to just say ""no"" late at night"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","It all makes sense. Lately I've discovered soooooo much about myself and my body from learning all the ways ADHD and Autism affect the body/mind. Honestly I implore all of y'all to 1. see if you could possibly be on the spectrum 2. see if you can find an ADHD mind / body specialist 3. if not or even if so. RESEARCH RESEARCH RESEARCH. Just from google / reddit / instagram / etc I have learned sooo much relating to how my disorders affect my mind / body that my psychiatrist, therapist, and GP didn't even have in their textbooks. They make it exponentially harder for us to make it in this world because we don't work the way they do. We need to advocate for ourselves and our wellbeing because unfortunately almost every doctor out there will not give you the help you actually need unless you do the research yourself and advocate for yourself. Even then you may have to go to different doctors to get what you need. Like I'm pretty sure I have POTS which is connected to ADHD / Autism and I'm currently in the process of trying to find a doctor who can test for that as mine cannot. These articles are sooo interesting tho and I had no idea my binge eating was related to my ADHD but seriously that just proves there is soooo much out there to learn about this disorder it could really really help you to know. :)) hope y'all have a great day. You are important and you matter, and I love all of you <3."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Right!!!!!!! I didn't know this until recently either
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","I‚Äôve never been pregnant, but I know it takes a huge toll on your body. Creating a baby takes huge energy. Milk production also requires more energy. 

Nourish your body and get plenty of rest. Great job on the baby!"

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","I was taking Ambien for years, binge eating at night‚Ä¶gained 40 lbs..then decided I‚Äôd had enough..stopped it and lost all the weight and Adderall helps to curb my appetite. Now I take Trazadone for sleep, which is MUCH safer and I sleep like a baby."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Mine is too
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Yeah, I thought I was seriously messed up before my ADHD diagnosis. I had been diagnosed with anxiety and also struggled with binge eating and addiction. I am 23 F and was diagnosed very recently, and it has been so liberating to learn that these are all a result of ADHD. I don't believe that it's my fault that I have a genetic condition that affects my thinking, and there is something I can do about it. Once I became medicated for ADHD, I stopped binge eating immediately. I have breakthroughs with all of the underlying conditions, but therapy and education are helping me so much!"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","RIGHT!?! Just had this epiphany and honestly, it's been life-altering. It reduced a lot of the shame I felt for bingeing

I no longer feel like I'm addicted to food, I now know I was just self-medicating. Without bingeing I had no motivation, no attention, and after bingeing I was finally able to start tasks and write my essays.

Knowing bingeing was a **symptom** rather than the underlying condition, I can find other sources of dopamine like caffeine to increase dopamine. 

I've also been working on improving my dopamine sensitivity so that I don't have the urge to binge for dopamine. Vigorous for like 30 mins daily and eating a ton of plants/legumes for gut health has helped so much.

I just have a rule with myself that I can't eat anything processed or high in sugar/saturated fat (even plant foods like dates are too high in sugar). Once my brain gets a small dose of the dopamine from something really fatty or sweet, it's over. I binge all day long.

My diet is pre-planned and incredibly bland. It keeps my brain from lighting up and bingeing. I just eat lean meat, vegetables, some fruit, and whole grains. No artificial sweetener because that lights up your brain too. 

Once your gut health improves you might actually have fewer symptoms ([ADHD & Gut Health](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/adhd-and-gut-health-study-finds-link-to-fungi-in-microbiome#Balancing-the-guts-microbiota)). Your sensitivity to dopamine will also improve which means you'll need less of it."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Yep Vyanse completely halted my binge eating disorder. Absolutely love Vyvanse.

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Yep once I started taking strattera my binge eating totally stopped.

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",I just started Straterra for ADHD and my food noise that I've had up to 11 my whole life went completely silent.

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","I also am the same and didn‚Äôt even realise it was related until I told my psychiatrist that I‚Äôm trying to lose weight because I‚Äôm pre-diabetic, and I have it under control but then something stressful triggers me and I binge.

She was like ‚Äúoh, I can help you with that‚Äù. Switched me to vyvanse and I haven‚Äôt binged since. I was like ‚Äúyou mean‚Ä¶there are people who don‚Äôt regularly fight the urge to consume their body weight in sugar alllll. the. tiimmmeeee?‚Äù Mind blown."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Thank you for sharing that
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",ADHD leads to stress and stress leads to binge eating. Especially stress linked eating will be cravings for sugary or salty food
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","View yourself as you would viewing someone else in your position.

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Figured this out recently too. So thankful for ADHD awareness on these forums. I wish I'd known 30 years ago and could have worked on it!
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Got this information yesterday. My partner always said I had a eating disorder. Now I know why I could force feed myself unstoppable.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Om nom nom dopamine. I imagine myself like pacman sometimes..
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Wow. From the moment I was diagnosed with ADHD and started learning about it, I knew my addiction to sugar was 100% a need for dopamine. But I didn't realize this plagued other people too, or that there was research behind it.

I have always been, uh, highly food-motivated. When I was younger and less disciplined I would often pick up errant skittles or whatever that I discovered on the ground and eat them because just the sight of them triggered impossibly strong cravings. These days I try not to buy anything sweet, because if I get a package of cookies I'll just eat them all at once as soon as I get home. Even fruit, I have been known to keep eating to the point of sickness. I remind myself of the family dog who discovers some random human food, eats the entire thing including plastic packaging in 2 seconds, then requires a midnight trip to the vet.

Every evening in bed I review the day and think of what my high point was; more often than anything else, it's lunch or dinner. I have been lucky to stay skinny through good genes and a love of exercise, or possibly through constant fidgeting, but skinny does not equal healthy. I am actually pre-diabetic.

Those articles are great and I thank you for posting them but they've gotten me thinking of food again. Going to go to bed and dream of my morning oatmeal."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Yep lost 10 kg in a few weeks thanks to meds that treat adhd (I'm overweight)
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",if I forgot to take my medication I would just eat all day
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Chasing after dopamine to get our brains up to baseline will have us doing absolutely anything and everything, unfortunately."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Most addictions really. People with adhd are more likely to smoke, do drugs, binge game etc. we‚Äôre seeking things that are high reward."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",this + a thyroid issue make my weight yoyo so much it drives me insane </3
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Yup get a nicotine vape. It solves this problem pretty fast. Only downside is you hit the vape for dopamine. But I find it to be an upside, diet effects the way our brain works, high protein diets my friends."

It doesn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôm an emotional Bippity girly  too

Wasn‚Äôt til high school at a boyfs house where I didn‚Äôt wanna be rude after given so much food and let out a big sigh while eating and he said ‚Äúfull huh‚Äù

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Yup. I'm a chronic binge eater. I know I'm not hungry while scoffing down loads of food. Hell I even know I'm full but can't stop. Turns out I want those sweet sweet chemicals. One of the main reasons I wanted a diagnosis. I've yoyo-ed for years. I'll get super healthy and once that's down its no longer interesting and I go back to the binging. Had one too many burn outs now so can't seem to create any new healthy habits at all. Come on titration (please fix me üò≠üòÇüò≠üòÇ)

It's pure sensory. 

I like how food feels and tastes"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","I was diagnosed with ADHD last year. When I dove into my research rabbit hole I was just in awe. I had a RAGING eating disorder for years and could never 100% recover because omfg, I wasn‚Äôt trying to run away from trauma that I must have forgotten. It was undiagnosed ADHD. I was let down by so many therapists. I was super angry for awhile. Motherhood also made my symptoms so bad I thought I needed to be institutionalized. My son is 3.5 and I‚Äôm just now finding a good balance with all of it."

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","I have binge eating disorder and adhd. My doctor prescribed me Ritalin for my eating disorder, and not my adhd. But it‚Äôs helping with both. Vyvanse is meant for BED more than Ritalin my insurance just won‚Äôt pay for it so I defaulted to Ritalin. I take it thirty minutes before I eat and it helps a little with my impulsive cravings."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","I can‚Äôt tell if Im a binge eater or not but even with a relatively high dose of vyvanse I still feel like I have no control on how much of things I eat. (Vyvanse is also used for binge eating per the manufacturer website.) I feel more recently that I have impulsively ate more of things or ate bigger portions of meals than I should have mostly to ‚Äúreward‚Äù myself because of getting through a bad day or tough day at work. And it‚Äôs that I truly enjoy the taste of some things and want more no matter how hungry or full I am. Anyone else do this? I‚Äôm trying to see if it is based on impulsive tendencies with my ADHD, some sort of reward mechanism that is happening when I eat, both of these resulting in binge eating, or something completely unrelated and should get professional help from someone that isn‚Äôt a psychiatrist lol"

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Yeah I actually did a paper on it for school! People with adhd Especially girls are WAY more likely to get eating disorders especially bc of meds
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Is there any good scientific info here or is it just a bunch of comments of people saying ""omg me too"" because I'd like to learn more about this. I always thought it was just because I'm coming down off stimulants and the hunger hits, and I still have no idea what anyone is talking about but everyone else here seems to know what we're talking about.

It's like a thread where someone posts an image/clip from a game or movie and it's just 1000s of comments talking about how good or bad the movie or game is *with no one saying what the name is.*"

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Everyone is a bingeater!! You can not blame your adhd for this.

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Down 25 pounds since February and I started taking atomoxetin . Some of that is from no longer impulse eating. Some of that is from cutting my drinking from 10 to 12 glasses a week to one or two a month. Not exactly impulse drinking but the ability to say no. I just need one or two.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Yes, eating sugary / salty / MSG-ridden food is highly dopaminergic, you'll often eat purely because it's ""satisfying"" and rarely because you're hungry.

You'll actually eat when you know you're hungry, in confusion, because it's so satisfying.

Meds are wild, you suddenly don't crave any rubbish, and you forget to eat, so you go from compulsive binge eating to... forgetting to eat.

I had a habit of stocking up on junk food because it felt comforting, and since taking meds I haven't touched any of it. I took a 2 day break from the meds recently, and ate the entire supply somehow.

I've managed to avoid buying more since then."

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",CRUNCHY
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Yep. Before I was diagnosed (and medicated) I started picking up what are in hindsight, extremely obviously dopamine-farming strategies with food. 

I‚Äôd be working on a PSET (homework but in college) in the late hours of the night and keep myself going by eating super processed junk food (candy, chips, anything you‚Äôd find in an average vending machine really) nearly constantly. I wasn‚Äôt hungry or at a calorie deficit; it was entirely emotional.  It felt like I couldn‚Äôt get anything done without the snacks‚Äî I would literally stare blankly at the screen or a wall if I didn‚Äôt cave and eat them. I was actually triggering much-needed dopamine-production by eating high-sugar, high-fat, high-salt foods.

Medication is great for binge and emotional eating though, since it both gives your dopamine and most are appetite suppressants."

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","There is this idea I read about that seemed obvious but also brilliant, design your environment. So it takes a bit if effort to setup but the idea is if you want to avoid things, use your environment to put obstacles in your way. I.e place the snacks on a high shelf in the garage and put the step ladder in a different room. 
Same thing if you want to encourage yourself to do something , put it in a super accessible place with zero road blocks i.e chop up and prepare healthy snacks in advance, leave fruit out on the counter, eliminate as many steps from these choices as possible.

Then you just let your brain do the work and hopefully it's not being a shit and will choose the easy af option over the laborious difficult option. Good luck though, it's not 100% full proof in my experience I will sometimes summon immense amounts of motivation out of nowhere and go to great lengths of effort for a bag of chips."

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Are you on meds? If so, pregnancy can increase your meds needs, so it might be worth discussing upping your dose. (Ftr I had to up both my adhd and anxiety meds, and then go back down to pre pregnancy dose on just the anxiety meds.)


Also frankly, that‚Äôs why for my first pregnancy I just about had a panic attack when my gp suggested taking an adderall break. I was like ‚ÄòI cannot. I will be nonfunctional and eat everything all of the time‚Äô. They were like ‚Äòwell can you eat like healthy foods all day‚Äô and I was like ‚Äòhahaha no‚Äô, and they were like ‚Äòwell then, perinatal psychiatrist referral it is!‚Äô And I stayed on my meds, was occasionally functional, and only ate most of the things, some of the time."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",I on the other hand do not associate eating with feeling good or happy times.

Small wonder why the first term I actually did well since elementary school was the same term I was diagnosed with an ED (which I acquired as a result of self control, ie not binge eating and not having a proper grasp on what a ""good amount"" was, if I stopped feeling super hungry I stopped eating because I thought that was how it worked, and the 2000s really pushed the ""don't eat too much, being fat is worse than being vain or homophobic or a douche"" message hard).

When my binging is the worst, so is my ADHD, which conversely makes my binging worse (dealing with this rn), as I actually got through college without meds or an IEP by doing a strict meal plan with one cheat meal a week as a reward for finishing my work and workouts (as I was a figure competitor, and that actually was the way I got over my ED) and I started figuring out that fasting gave me more energy and focus (and made me less likely to fall asleep or lose focus when I had procrastinated some project until 2 days before it was due.

""Food gives you energy"" yeah no, not really, just need it to live, and apparently in order to continously self sabotage apparently lol"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",FELT! You‚Äôre not alone
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Funny tho, since I've taken medication for ADHD and antidepressants... It stopped. That's when I knew it was connected. But I went from ""I forgot I ate"" to ""I forgot to eat"""
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Wow, my body flipped while pregnant. My adhd was out of control. I went off meds 2 weeks before getting pregnant for the first time in 20 years and holy shit- it was crazy. I‚Äôll be reading these."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",This problem post partum is literally killing my bank account (along with buying baby stuff)
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","been reading lots of testimonies from other BED sufferers that semaglutide/ozempic helps eliminate binge eating, and even desire to drink alcohol. 

It looks like a game changer, though lots of side effects - and a very high price tag, unfortunately. Still, I am at the point where I'd pay anything to get this monkey off my back."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","When I‚Äôm under meds, I literally have a big bag of chips to snack on while I‚Äôm studying. Those bags haven‚Äôt been opened in days. One of them ended up expiring!"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","I‚Äôm seeing a therapist for my eating disorder. I have issues with my image and identity, so I think it‚Äôs mostly that. But I will mention whether the ADHD is making things doubly hard."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",It's sooo wild how directly related my eating habits were influenced by my ADHD. I started vyvanse in the last fortnight and not ONCE have I even had any of the usual dopamine cravings I had previously.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",I can't drink caffeine because it makes another health issue worse. Really not good for my waistline and I definitely seek more of the reward from food that I used to get from a nice strong cup of tea!
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",I managed to figure this out when I was 13 or 14 it discovered this somewhere when I was thinking on why I kept eating when I was bored and not hungry.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","yeah.. it takes a fuck ton of will power to not do it... binge eating, drinking, etc. the dopamine cycle. A while ago I was briefly medicated and lost 30 lbs. At first I thought it was the meds being weird but now I realize that the meds helped me not binge eat."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Yep, eating for dopamine sucks, I'm struggling with weight loss and Pre-Diabetes for this has been a huge hurtle for me. Thankfully I've found healthier alternatives.

Binge eating baby cucumbers is infinitely healthier than any chips or I'll get multigrain chips if I'm looking for something salty."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Having my first baby and finding everything more difficult than it should have been is the reason I now know I have adhd. I‚Äôd just got used to my ‚Äúlaziness‚Äù beforehand. And now I‚Äôm struggling with the binge eating too. I‚Äôm taking meds but for a good while now I‚Äôve felt like they‚Äôre not working at all, at first they did help with impulsive eating then one day everything just went back to pre-medication days and I can‚Äôt even get off the sofa to do stuff anymore. Most times I pick up my prescription though I‚Äôm finding the seal has been broken which worries me."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","For a lot of us, eating/chewing is a stim, and it also can be very calming since it's repetitive and gives us something to focus on."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",my psychiatrist told me in my last appointment that obesity is related to the binge eating and hyperactivity
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",I just love having something yummy in my mouth (preferably something doughy or creamy). That's why I eat a lot.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","This was eye opening for me as an obese person diagnosed in my 30‚Äôs. The knowledge hasn‚Äôt helped me lose weight per se, but has helped with the weight of shame, which is helpful"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Most likely, te≈º. Also (fun fact) there was once a meeting with a dietician at my job and they stated that cravings for salty things might be related to some dopamine issues, so that was pretty interesting to know"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",I was diagnosed with ADHD in middle school but my parents wouldn‚Äôt treat it.  I developed an eating disorder at 16 and was bulimic for the next 12 years.  I tried getting medicated for my adhd as an adult but they wouldn‚Äôt treat it BECAUSE I had an eating disorder.  The Dr said it might suppress my appetite.  I was like that sounds amazing because it might help me get over my eating disorder.  Nope.  They were concerned I‚Äôd ‚Äúmisuse‚Äù the adhd medication to lose weight.  So I finally overcame the bulimia at 28.  Sought treatment for my ADHD a few years later around 31/32.  Such a massive difference in my ability to read and retain information.  I wonder what college might have been like medicated.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Yeah I realized I needed help when I was trying to lose the COVID weight and noticed that all my excess calorie intake would occur whenever I have trouble motivating myself to concentrate on working.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","That‚Äôs why stimulants suppress your appetite when you take them for ADHD, it‚Äôs used for both!"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","I feel this 100% and I am a nutrition/fitness coach for over 15 years with even certifications in begavior change and stress management. And everything I know works so well for others! I have trained/coached 300+ people successfully, i have competed in fitness competitions successfully....but i always had an issue with ""over snacking"" and it was just ü§èmuch harder for me mentally.

I created a coaching model around how I can't NOT take a bite of something random and how I ""love food"" and can also live well and find health... works so well to just keep me stable and maintain life while others see such great success in change with this model (so i guess I can't complain, but it sure makes sense).

Turns out i hyperfixate on foods. Like not an average person but in a way that hurts my brain...who knew??ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

41 years of being the perosn who always HAS to take bites of food (and leaves it in the package) or who can't NOT eat a food we just saw on a commercial... 
nutrition & behavior change/stress is my education and i always wondered why didn't it work for me as well as my clients...until I got diagnosed and began treating my adhd.
Omg. It was quite the eye opener! It all made sense. I don't do anything different but now I'm not hyperfixating on food or having that dopamine rush from snacks and it's easier to eat what i want and need.  My psyc explained it and it was like ü§Øü•≥."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",I kinda knew my ADHD and binge eating had a connection for years.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Yep.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",What would the dopamine be.      Is an actual drug.   I just thought our bodies made it. Didn‚Äôt know that they had an actual replacement they could give us!! .  Thought that it was a chemical reaction from giving us other things
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",I try to be really on top of helping my partner take their meds because if they don't they have to really fight a relapse for a few days. It's 100% linked in their case.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","This was my biggest ""Holy Sh**"" moment also when I started meds last year. (At age 41)"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",I try telling this to my doc and he comes back and says it‚Äôs depression. Then why didn‚Äôt I have this problem when my ADHD meds were higher?
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",I was the Same and my 4 year old is the same too. Can‚Äôt not keep her mouth quiet or not chewing on something.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",As soon as I fully realized my binge eating habits and how it‚Äôs related to ADHD I‚Äôve actually mostly stopped and have a lost weight. I quit drinking too after realizing I only did it to feel something other than boredom lol 15 lbs down.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Yea classic dopamine seeking lol i had that problem
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",I lost 20 lbs in 6 weeks when I finally started taking stimulants üòÖ
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","I was just learning about this as well, because I've been so frustrated with being obese for several years. 

Turns out, there's a reason I have a hard time detecting when to stop eating or that I need to wait longer before eating again because I'm not done digesting. I'd have days where I'm so uncomfortably full. The impulse will hit me and i just can't pass up the opportunity for something new or delicious. This is also exacerbated by NOT eating for too long, hitting a blood sugar crash because my body would refuse to switch into ketosis (chronic high-carb diet did this to me), and now I have to IMMEDIATELY solve the problem or im just gonna pass out or be in pain from the hunger (pain is an incredible motivator ;-; ).

I was in way better shape when my meals were structured by my caregivers, and I would just go,go,go all day. 

The unfortunate consequences of dysregulated eating has cost me my gal bladder, which also gave me non-alcoholic fatty liver syndrome. That effectively ruins your health faster, so for the love of goat do your best to structure your diet even if it means getting help."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","makes sense i just ate half a bag of chips followed up by a chunk of cheese, then i had dessert, prob cuz i was bored."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","I was doing the same. I just needed the stimulation. Now that I‚Äôm medicated, I‚Äôve lost 15 pounds"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",You care for your toddler. Many people can't/don't swing that part.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Oh I‚Äôm not alone
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",I‚Äôm not crazy!!!! Yay
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","That‚Äôs exactly it. It‚Äôs like a feral animal that takes over even as I‚Äôm thinking I shouldn‚Äôt be doing this. It will be a long while, but I look forward to starting meds after I give birth and once I‚Äôm done breastfeeding. I can only imagine how gratifying it must be to stop at the feeling of fullness. I‚Äôm glad you regained control!"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Yep, that was me too. My kids never completely finish their food either so I always gobbled it up right after they were done. I realized the vyvanse was working well when I started just throwing away their leftovers haha. It has been really nice not thinking about food 24/7.

Have to add alcohol to that too. I don't drink much since I have kids, but I always thought about it for felt like I needed a drink around family or friends but now I don't even think about it and just enjoy the company."

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",I just read this and cried. It‚Äôs so comforting to know I‚Äôm not alone. I start taking Ritalin tomorrow and am praying it has the same effect on me
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Which medicine?
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Ugh I wish meds helped me like this

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",30 here
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Even those without ADHD consume copious amounts of food (speaking of America mostly) for its dopaminergic effects. That‚Äôs my theory why everyone in America is so fat
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","42 for me, and then I lost 40 lbs without trying after getting on meds"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Yah I realized this about a month ago randomly lol üòÇ suddenly my long time snack obsession made so much sense
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",How has figuring it out helped though?
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",And now...?
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","This. I still do it because it's very effective lol but I started to make my meals more hearty and nutritious by adding things instead of taking things away so like for e.g. I'll cut up fruits in my cereal, add some nuts and peanut butter for protein."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",That's why I drink tons of caffeine too. Caffeine = dopamine for me.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",How did you fix it?

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",doesn‚Äôt help me anymore i feel eternally broken
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Such a game changer for me. I used to eat constantly all day. Non stop. Mostly bad food but pretty much any food. 
Jumped on Vyvanse and all of a sudden normal portions kept me satiated and happy. It was such a relief. I notice when it wears off at night though cause I can get that hunger again."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Vyvanse absolutely obliterated my appetite ü•≤
Worth it tho."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Would Vyvanse be better than concerta for it, I was always on concerta growing up and just got back on it."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","I wish i could take it. Made my gums hurt, bleed, and have dry mouth that couldn‚Äôt be quenched."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Yeah, because it‚Äôll make you tired after 6 hours and an emotional wreck before 6 hours."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Hah. Just wrote the exact same reply.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Damn I wish it worked for me. I can't stop snacking on it.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","It actually acts as double whammy in that regard, because it acts as a hunger suppressant whilst also satisfying the dopamine needs and avoiding the additional cravings for food."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Too bad it doesn't actually seem to help. If anything it just makes me want to eat more. I feel best at 30 lbs lighter (and being part Asian and having diabetes and high cholesterol run in that side of my family I should be a bit lighter anyway for my health) but 5 years ago for the first time in my adult life I lost control and never got it back even with 40 MG Vyvanse.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",It's illegal in the Philippines üòÇüòÇüò≠üò≠
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Which I don‚Äôt understand why? My doctor told me meds would help my binge because they control appetite but like‚Ä¶‚Ä¶appetite was never the reason. It was lack of dopamine food it the only thing that is an instant emotional pain relief I will eat until I‚Äôm physically sick meds or not lol
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Existing is extraordinarily difficult and it frustrates me so much when others seem to act as if it isnt!
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Same here! I'm a teacher with two little ones at home so I came home exhausted and couldn't work out until after they were asleep. By that time it felt pointless. Our second one has been much more of a handful too but he recently started sleeping throughout the night.

 Always thinking about my next meal too...constantly. I started vyvanse this summer and it has been great, while helping me focus on the workouts and not giving up. I've thankfully lost about 15 lbs so far."

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Yessss chewing gum does help sometimes, I will use that trick too but like you said sometimes it doesn't fully satisfy what you need. Sometimes I would chew on gum so much or fast and my damn cheek muscles would start to hurt lmao"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","That could also be the socialization, oxytocin is a known appetite suppressant and I myself am noticeably less hungry during outings with friends than by myself."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Does eating an apple count as success? I had no  idea how hard the hormone and ADHD combo can really hit. This is pretty surreal.

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","same here. I've had body dysmophia, shame and eating disorders my whole life . I wish I could offer you a permanent cure, but I'm here at 42 still struggling from time to time. Overall, I'm much better than I used to be, but I doubt I'll ever be fully free from this very natural way of coping for me.  

My best recommendation is to force yourself into a regular daily routine with regular (and large enough filling meals - that you enjoy). Even if you binged, still eat a meal and resist the urge to restrict. Restriction/compensatory actions will only lead to more binges, trust me. I know the massive amount of shame around all this, and it's so much to carry. But you can take back power one day and one meal at a time. You are not bad for binge eating. It's just your default setting for self-regulation and getting dopamine to make yourself feel better. You might still struggle occasionally (like I do), but the worst thing is to beat yourself up after having a binge. Remind yourself that you are powerful and capable and you can do anything you set your mind to, because you CAN."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","It surprised me, that it helped me as well. Once a month I had ""Bulimia"", even with Strattera. I thought it was more a psychological thing, because I don't fulfill the criteria for ""Bulimia nervosa"".

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Then we need a proper name for what we do.

I find that I still eat/crave crap - ice cream, chocolate, burritos, chips, pastries, but I am satisfied on very small quantities of it, and overall eat way smaller portions of everything. 

However, even while on meds - sometime if I am going through a particularly emotionally challenging period or big life change - I will have strong desires to binge just out of very old habit. Then I'm even more frustrated because I feel like even the medication can't outpower my dysfunction. I'm currently in a situation like this now and it SUCKS. I just have to ride it out."

Your best bet is to start working on getting a diagnosis. And if you are, then your doctor/neuropsychologist will work with you to create a treatment plan - it can be as simple as just medication and periodic check-ins (they will try different meds and doses until they find one that works for you). Or sometimes there‚Äôs other issues that come out in addition or instead of and so therapy combined with whatever medication is a better approach. 

I encourage you to advocate for yourself no matter what!"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",lol technically you can but only under certain circumstances. in our critical care part of school i always told my bestfriend i wish i could have dopamine IV.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","No, it wouldn't work. The dopamine wouldn't be able to enter your central nervous system because of the blood brain barrier. I'm a medical student with ADHD."

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",My therapist says realizing that's why you do it is the first step. But I realize that's why I do it and it doesn't stop me yet lol. I think finding another activity that gives you that hit may be the solution.

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Not really, I exercise a lot and it just makes me eat even more.  I was running decent mileage with weekly half marathons at 220-225lb before I got diagnosed.  I‚Äôm tall and athletic so its not like I was in awful shape but I was definitely carrying some weight that I didn‚Äôt need.  Higher protein and more fiber probably help to some degree but weren‚Äôt enough for me on their own."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Alcoholism? Risky sex? Street drugs? Self harm?

There's a lot of answers to this question but most of them are way worse than binge eating, unfortunately."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","I find it easy to resist buying junk at the store but when it's night time the cravings come knocking. So my solution is to not buy any junk, that way the cravings kinda give up because they're never rewarded with anything fun."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Instead of eating *more* food, try eating food that gives you more dopamine for less calories, like stronger flavours. 

For me, that means coffee so strong you need knife and fork, whisky that tastes like you're licking an ashtray, and most of all: anything spicy. You simply stop eating once you've got hiccups, sweat pouring from your forehead,  a mouth on fire,  and you're wondering whether you're doing permanent damage to your GI tract."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","I started seeing a dietician before I got diagnosed with adhd and Binge Eating Disorder as I was experiencing prediabetic symptoms. I got diagnosed months and months later. But my dietician has been incredible. My binge eating stemmed from a lot of different things - a lot of it was because I would restrict myself from eating certain things because they were ""bad"" and they wouldn't fit my calorie intake. Fully ditched calorie counting and threw my scales away not long ago. The thing that helped me most was to eat more frequently. Smaller meals and snacks every 2-3 hours. I'd go all day without eating and then gorge myself on anything and everything I could after a day of work. 

I'm now medicated and have much better eating habits. It's hard work - but if you have the means to work with a professional who understands adhd and disordered eating, its worth a shot."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Sleep. But who has the luxury to nap 5 times a day?
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","I‚Äôm just getting started on this right now, but the more I see myself doing it, the more grace I can offer myself. What was ‚Äújust‚Äù a character flaw and laziness for 3 and a half decades is now a neurological disorder, and that makes a difference.

Noticing your behaviour or physical cues is the first step in CBT, isn‚Äôt it? So, if the medication can make me aware of what I‚Äôm doing, I can start modifying my behaviour. (I already am!!!) Presumably after I stabilize, I would be able to taper off but still benefit from the modified behaviours?"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","For me a mindset shift worked wonders!! I followed Ilana Muhlstein and she works on what goes into your body but also the mind!! It has healed me after many many years and tears so highly recommend. It still took me a long time, its not a quick fix. She is keen on eating veggies first and a lot of fibres."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","eat more protein. the average person eats way less protein than they really should and protein keeps you feeling full for longer

ever since I started eating my body weight‚Äôs worth of protein in grams every day I eliminated all of my late night and mid-day snack cravings

if you dont weight train or exercise then you dont need that much, but the BARE minimum is like 30% of your body weights worth of protein in grams so take that however youd like.

to further explain my anecdotal experience: im pretty confident i used to eat for dopamine. I literally was eating every time I was bored especially during covid.

but falling in love with the gym and eating protein completely eliminated my snacking. i do not take medications for adhd"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","I found that using Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) has helped curb excessive eating (when I remember to do it!). The gist of it is tapping on key acupressure points on the face, chest and wrist whilst working through the craving. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm craving doughnuts‚Äù tap tap tap on wrist. It‚Äôs also good for working through flashbacks when guided by a professional. For cravings and binging though - 50% of the time it works every time ;)"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Don‚Äôt buy it
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Vyvanse is used to treat binge eating disorder.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","There have been a couple of methods that helped me out before I was even diagnosed with ADHD. And sticking to them as best as I could even helped me lose weight.

For starters, be aware of why you want to eat. Is it because you are actually hungery, then you should definitely eat something. But if it is because you are just craving food or aim to satisfy an emotional need, then you don't need to eat and should try not to. When you can do that, you can even reward yourself with a snack from time to time, but only when you want to, not because you mind or emotions are telling you.

Another method is portions. So say you might usually eat a bag of chips in one go. Get a little bowl, fill it up with chips and just eat what's in the bowl and store the rest of the bag away.

You can also keep it in mind while you are shopping. Instead of getting a bag of chips go for a bag of nuts. Thus, replacing a less healthier option for a healthier one. Or don't even buy any snacks at all, if you don't have it around you can't eat it either.

Combining the above has helped me to decrease my food intake between meals considerably. So hopefully these methods can help some of you as well"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Healthy foodis expensive that's also a reason
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","it's not just America anymore, though. We Americans have probably been the pioneers and will remain the champs for this behavior, but I'm seeing it in France too, now where I live. The food is ridiculously cheap (and delicious) in the area that I live in, and ""le snacking"" has become a favorite hobby of many. However, still as a whole - there isn't anywhere near the level to eat for comfort/dopamine or poor food relationship in general as there is in the US."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","It‚Äôs a lot more complicated than that! There are food deserts and many local convenience stores don‚Äôt sell fresh produce. There‚Äôs also a lack of education on nutrition and wellness. 
Public schools in the US are notoriously underfunded and unfortunately the school lunch program suffers, and they opt in for cheap, heavily processed foods"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",I cannot believe I‚Äôve gone clueless about it into my fifties.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","A big part of binge eating is having neurological challenges with interoception, which means that we often struggle to properly sense both hunger and satiety. Some even experience difficulty with being aware of and attentive to the sensations of eating, such as chewing and swallowing. Binging can also be linked to sensory seeking or self soothing stimming. It‚Äôs a very complex behavior that can definitely have ADHD as it‚Äôs catalyst."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","I‚Äôm right with you! When I got my meds **shocker** my appetite significantly calmed down. I kinda knew food was a coping mechanism for me, but that it was primarily tied to my ADHD was a surprise."

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",I‚Äôm so sorry to hear that but the good news is there is a ray of hope! It‚Äôs not perfect and doesn‚Äôt work for everyone but I found that my medication tempered but didn‚Äôt fully stop my binging. So I started investing in other (lower to no calorie) dopamine sources! I got a soda/water carbonator (love the bubbles) and sugar free syrups (sweet treat and bubbles? Score!) as well as salty subs for things that I crave (salty crispy chickpeas or edamame are my subs for potato chips). I keep them on Amazon auto order so I don‚Äôt forget to get them lol hope this helps even a small amount fellow ADHD friend!! Much peace and love
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Broken is the right word here. No medication has helped with my eating habits and it‚Äôs so much work to fail every day.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","You may need to switch meds for a while due to tolerance. I've heard some people switch between Vyvanse and Adderall to prevent growing too tolerant of one or the other. Talk to your provider about it. I happen to have both available to me die to my erratic sleep schedule. Can't take Vyvanse if I need to try and sleep in 6 hours, whereas Adderall metabolizes much faster and gives me a ""ha ha"" fighting chance."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Fat AF on adderall. When I first took it I lost a ton of weight. I hate to admit it, but I kind of miss feeling grossed out by food."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",I bet you‚Äôre sleep deprived. Sometimes when i start feeling like this i‚Äôll take vacation from vyvanse for a weekend and get some really really good sleep.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Nothing worse than when the ‚Äúfix all‚Äù builds up a tolerance.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Yeah because you have to change your habits, the drug doesn‚Äôt just magically make you better. You gotta use the norepinephrine it gives you in your pre-frontal cortex to make healthy decisions. Sugar directly impacts this process gives you the rush of norep, dopamine, and serotonin and then your neurons are zapped and your brain won‚Äôt produce more naturally."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Nobody knows, since effects of medication vary from person to person. For me Vyvanse was hell. I was cold sweating, impulsive, and paranoid. Concerta helped me with my depression and made my mood a lot better."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Right. And it helps with my impulsivity, which helps me make better food choices."

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Wow thank u! I can't believe I never knew this. I have binge eating and adhd as well
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Binging big time. For me it is a combo of not having the interoception to know if I'm hungry or full (until I eat until I'm super sick), forgetting to eat, eating because I'm bored and searching for dopamine snacks. Then I suddenly started obsessing in the other direction with really bad restricted eating and obsessive tracking....not a vibe. That is actually why I went to the dietitian and she explained it all to me."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","The dietitian just asked me to trust that I don't know if I'm hungry ans realy don't have the headspace to figure it out right now so she calculated when, what and approximately how much was a healthy diet and made sure to remind me that perfection isn't the goal and have a beer and a donut if you want.

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Those are both ok to take during pregnancy! I‚Äôm on both, and escitalopram. Welbutrin post pregnancy for ppd, but my psych said she uses it for patients with adhd during pregnancy as an adderall alternative because it has some effects on dopamine as well, though not as much. 

If I recall correctly, what I was told was that adderall isn‚Äôt proven to be safe, but the data that they do have doesn‚Äôt indicate that it‚Äôs unsafe, either, at therapeutic doses, that there‚Äôs no indication it causes any birth defects, the only thing they noticed was that babies might have a slightly lower birthweight. I remember that one, because adderall and cipralex both had the same risks. 

I‚Äôm in Canada. I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like where you are, but I was lucky enough to be in the care of a (woman) gp whose specialty was adhd, who took me seriously, and like I said, she was upfront about not knowing enough about pregnancy and meds and sent me to a specialist. And that psychiatrist was the one who actually gave me heck for sometimes missing a day of meds because hey I have adhd.  This was my first kid. 

My second, three and a half years later, I was with a different gp, who also sent me to a perinatal psych, but also didn‚Äôt even bring up the possibility of stopping my meds. Some of that was going off of what I had done last time, but also the idea of treating pregnant women with adhd was a reasonable and not novel thing for him. 

My guess is that you might have to work to find a provider who‚Äôs knowledgeable, and will have to advocate for yourself, and be prepared to educate your providers, but there are resources and research out there, and plenty of people out there who‚Äôve gone through pregnancy while on their medications. and if you‚Äôre thinking about kids in the future it‚Äôs worth starting to work on setting up the network and resources you‚Äôd need now, beforehand, so that you don‚Äôt have to do it while pregnant and miserable. 

The thing is, medication risk doesn‚Äôt occur in a vacuum. There are some unknowns about the effects these drugs have on a fetus, yes. It‚Äôs not risk free. 

But not taking them isn‚Äôt ‚Äòeverything is the same except that those risks are gone‚Äô. Not taking them means your mental and physical health suffer, which negatively impacts you (relevant!), and also negatively impacts the fetus. Your meds help you take care of yourself, which is directly relevant to taking care of the baby. It‚Äôs not even like you suffer but the baby is unaffected. ‚ÄòEven‚Äô in heavy air quotes there, because your health matters full stop. 

I have *feelings* on this, but the Tl;dr is that some providers suck, but that yes, medicating adhd during pregnancy is doable and done."

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Noticing it‚Äôs just the first step. Now you have to find a way to interrupt behavior. With something that‚Äôs not destructive. It can be done.

13 months ago my appetite became completely suppressed as an unintended side effect of [something else]. For the first time in my life, I was eating in response to physical cues rather than impulse. And fatty food in particular repulsed me. (Still does). I feel full‚Ä¶ and so I stop eating. I‚Äôve had to adapt to eating less while also trying to delay diabetes onset: not eating for many hours is bad for blood glucose levels, but I often forget to eat now until my body is physically hungry, and that is way too long in between meals. I still have a giant stash of candy in my closet, but I don‚Äôt mindlessly eat it. The Ritalin is now giving me impulse control, so I suspect that candy will go down, too."

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","I always advise to air caution when explaining possible personal effects of ADHD, as we all (should) know the behaviours can be traits or habits for everyone without ADHD too. The condition doesn‚Äôt force any trait, it‚Äôs just we search for something to get that bump of dopamine and that manifests differently in all of us as we know. Good thing is being aware of why we do a particular habit is more than half the battle as we can now put in place ‚Äòblockers‚Äô or routines to help prevent them. It‚Äôs then another mental challenge of creating those routines. Routines for routines lol. It can be done very well, good luck!"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Unfortunately one of the best replacements is excersise in a pound for pound dopamine exchange.

I say unfortunately because I do not enjoy excersise, and have to trick myself/come up with elaborate reasons as to why I WANT to do it that are so much deeper than ""it's good for you."" Though gamifying it through doing Just Dance and stuff like that works pretty well for me, anything competitive üòâ"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Can confirm. I used to drink a lot of alcohol in the evenings to 'wind down' until I discovered that the stimulation/activity/busyness that I wanted from sipping alcoholic drinks can also come from those fancy sparkling water beverages. I now have a Sodastream at home and at work, and I sleep a lot better because the booze (depressant) isn't leaving my system in the middle of the night and waking me up.

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",That is so me! Except I do that with hot chips!
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Exercising will always make you want you to eat because your body is telling you it needs the resources for those worked muscles, it‚Äôs what you replenish them with. Some proteins and foods are better are giving a fuller feeling even though you eat less in amount of calories compared to something of that same calorific value. But the only way of losing weight is a calorie deficit no matter what diet you on. Reducing calories from your normal standard will leave you feeling more hungry than before because your current standing of weight notices it‚Äôs missing. So as I said try find some foods that help you feel fuller for longer just to offset that slightly. Some people who say they monitor their diet actually don‚Äôt enough or to the degree they think, snacking or eating more calories from foods than they realise. This isn‚Äôt to say you aren‚Äôt aware of any of this, just sometimes a reminder can give a nudge, or a little nugget of info out of it that you didn‚Äôt think of, helps things click. Good luck in the future!"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Ugh hate it but literally that's it. I realize I binge eat because of this but I literally cannot stop.

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Absolutely true, but this is about how much dopamine a particular food provides. A $20/lb steak releases far less dopamine than a $3 party size bag of Cheetos. There was a recent article about how Cheetos are designed to be dopaminergic. Even things like the mess on your fingers from the Cheetos is dopaminergic"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Healthy *convenient* food is expensive.

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Absolutely not true. Processed food is much more expensive ounce for ounce.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","I agree completely. But as I mentioned in another comment, cheap, processed food tends to be far more dopaminergic. Think Oreos vs a chicken Caesar salad. Although that might be an oversimplification"

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","If you are referring to stimulants, they suppress any appetite. I tried switching from adderall to Ritalin a few months back and I lost like 8lbs in ten days, and I‚Äôm not the kind of person that has eight pounds to lose.  

Many models develop cocaine addictions because staying thin is a breeze if you do coke."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","I found it pretty easy to switch from soda to seltzer water. You get most of the same sensory stimulation soda gives, but without the sugar and calories."

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Wow I love this.
About 1.5 years ago I gave up alcohol (still off it). I knew I needed a distraction, so I allowed myself unlimited sweet treats, soda, chips etc. 

Rather than getting fat, I lost weight, and natural tendencies to eat smarter snacks and low/no sugar just felt right. List 9 kilos all up with that plan and have touched a drink in 500+ days.

So having a bounty of yummy distractions on hand 24/7 really worked for me during those first few months üëçüèº"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","A lot of the problem is the cycle of guilt. Giving up the guilt and convincing yourself that you aren't broken is hard, but when you begin to show love to yourself you will begin to treat yourself better.

With adhd, we often fall into the ""all or nothing"" mentality, but healthy life isn't a destination. It's just making better decisions when you can, and giving yourself some grace when you can't."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Tirzepatide will do it.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",CBT combined with medication may be helpful if you haven't given CBT a try!

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","semaglutide/ozempic works, but $$$$"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Has your doctor prescribed Wegovy? It‚Äôs being studied for all kinds of addiction.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","I did not know this but sounds interesting, I always assumed since both are stimulants that tolerance to one would still give you a tolerance to the other"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",yes i know it‚Äôs not a magical cure.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",See I've was on concerta when I was a kid until I decided to stop at 16 but at 29 I went back on it seeing as everything was getting worse I started back and everything been amazing it the only ADHD medication I've been on which is why I ask out of curiosity
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","My meds just don‚Äôt work but they‚Äôre all I can afford (I‚Äôm on generic Concerta my doctor recommends Vyvanse) 

I‚Äôm hoping once my health insurance hits I‚Äôll be able to switch over!"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Cannot say enough how much your first paragraph delighted me!
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Nah, anyone who acts like life is easy is only pretending. Nobody has it easy."

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Omg I do the same thing hahaha I've gone through so much gum!! I like adding more pieces sometimes to make a big chunk and just chomp away at it lmao
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Solidarity. One day at a time. I wish you self-love and forgiveness. And a half an ounce of motivation to do something you want or need to do.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Wow, thank you for sharing. I‚Äôm 39 and have been called bipolar my whole life until very recently. I‚Äôm having some deep revelations within myself right now. Stuff that I thought was just my personality has been very clearly a culprit of ADHD."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Honestly, I find it a bit funny and surprising that people benefitted so much from that comment.

I just saw this post and answered in the most matter of fact, honest, ‚Äúthis is what I see‚Äù way without any inherent feelings behind it lol. 

I‚Äôm glad my very bland and honest take helped a few people.:)"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Dude the self loathing. I've legit called myself a ""fat whore"" being totally serious lol. I sometimes overeat before work and I'm in construction so when I go into work already feeling like a fat fuck its just awful. Ruins my whole day"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Wow. I‚Äôve never heard of this before but I already take Wellbutrin. I‚Äôm going to ask my doc about it. Thanks!!
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",I am on 150mg wellbutrin+25mg naltrexone+15mg Adderall. I do that twice a day. It seems to be my magic combination. Feel great. ADHD is pretty much totally managed.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",I took Adderall for 10 years but opted for the non stim wellbutrin now and it worked pretty good
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","I‚Äôm not actually for ADHD. I never was officially diagnosed with ADHD but binge eating, yes, which is why I‚Äôm on Contrave. Just another reason why I‚Äôm sure I am. My wife is convinced I am as well and my son has been diagnosed and is also on the spectrum. Pretty positive it runs in the family on my Dad‚Äôs side."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",The dosage of Naltrexone in Contrave is higher. 25-50mg per day which is similar to the dosage for alcohol dependencies. Together they should act to suppress your appetite and significantly reduce cravings. I am doing great on them.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","My understanding is that LDN is short-acting, which means it briefly blocks the opioid receptors in the brain and then wears off, whereas Contrave has a lower dose of the long-acting version of naltrexone, so it's always providing a low-level blockade of the opioid receptors in the brain."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Also eating because shame that I binged??? Because that is a fun cycle
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Wow! Thank you for the detailed and thoughtful reply! Shortly after my adhd diagnosis i became pregnant & miscarried, but in my first visit with the midwife I was told to just stop taking adderall. At that point i didn‚Äôt realize how much it improved my mental health and I assumed my depressive symptoms were in high drive bc of changing hormones. 

Post-pregnancy I resumed my meds for a few years and in 2020 my anxiety got so overwhelming I didn‚Äôt think i could tolerate the adderall, but when i stopped taking it at that time my depression became severe and life-threatening. I decided then that I couldn‚Äôt consider life without meds again and have just always had it in my mind from that first appointment that that would mean pregnancy was off the table. 

I live in the southern US, which, you may have heard, hates for women to have bodily autonomy. Im i my late 30s & never imagined my situation would be so severe that in the case of an accidental pregnancy I would definitely consider abortion by any means, but currently any termination of pregnancy after 6wks is illegal and I just didn‚Äôt feel i could risk my mental health and wellbeing. I genuinely would like to consider the possibility of children though, and this definitely gives me more headspace to do that. 

So glad you found good drs üíóüíóüíó"

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","It'll be taken up by the blood vessels inside your nostrils. That won't bypass the blood brain barrier.

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",I went with a crippling drug and alcohol addiction for a while.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Are you me?
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Just start smoking.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","I did that but with drugs. The one that also is referred to as ""snow"". Glad to be in therapy and on meds, but it's crazy how much more I need to do to get dopamine."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Being able to keep certain foods in my place without fearing I'm going to binge on them is my dream. I'm constantly having deplorable food waste because I try to do it and eventually start to binge so I then throw the product out to stop me from going full hog on it. Thank you for sharing your story and the advice because it really did help give me some direction!

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","I've been running both a food and internet addiction my whole life, there is no swapping here ;;

(I have replaced binging with Destiny 2 somewhat, but talk about your expensive hobbies)"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",üòÇ I like the way you think!
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","If anything I was too concerned about hitting every nutrient.  Medication has already normalized my weight as I don‚Äôt feel the same urge to constantly overeat but am also trying to be less obsessive over every nutrient and just eat a balanced diet without making sure I get 100% vitamin E everyday, that kind of thing."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","try ozempic/semaglutide if you can? it's something I'm considering, even though I will have to pay a fortune out of pocket. I just want my life free from this obsession, and it looks like it eliminates it very well. I don't even care about the weight loss, it's the freedom from the addiction that is most appealing."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",I started Ozempic in May and literally the food noise I‚Äôve had my whole life is gone. I wouldn‚Äôt care if I didn‚Äôt lose a pound of weight. I finally feel like a normal person without food being on ny mind constantly.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",I should get myself banned from those delivery apps because I‚Äôll end up ordering junk food from them
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Hey! So I'm more inclined to binge in the evenings. I'm definitely noticing in the past month or so, I'm a little more partial to sweets at night again. But I've noticed it and am starting to make sure I'm getting enough protein and staying hydrated - which helps me a lot. 

I eat more regularly, and it definitely helps. I try eat something small every 2-3 hours and it keeps that insatiable feeling at bay. I'm going to try and change up my after work snacks to something higher in protein to help avoid intense sugar cravings. 

But overall, I'm definitely better off. It's a process, and I don't think I'm ever going to have a ""finished result."" But I'm doing my best every day that I can. 

Good luck and be kind to yourself. I talk about it a bunch in a YouTube video I made if you want to check it out. I'm shameless in the self plugs, but this video seems to be helping a bunch of people.

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","ik its expensive, but chicken thigh, salmon, cottage cheese, tofu, and a lot of other tasty things have a lot of protein packed in there. tuna is a super awesome source if you like it."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","That's interesting. I crave steak constantly but cheetos seem disgusting unless I'm so hungry I'll eat anything. The threshold is a *little* lower for Doritos since those actually taste good to me, but like, I'll take meat and veggies over junk food any day because of how they taste and how they make me feel, I just can't afford it consistently due to making $17/hr and being too exhausted to do anything just working 30 hrs a week. :/"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Flaming hot cheetos were like crack cocaine to me in my 20s.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Every single snack / fast food product has spent millions (if not billions) in R&D to make their product as addictive as possible. 

https://www.kcrw.com/culture/shows/life-examined/food-history-addiction-mindful-eating/michael-moss-hooked-book"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Cheetos are $11 - $15 per pound depending on where you buy. I could get a lot of healthy food or at least a mid level steak for that.

Hinestly, all junk good is designed to be addictive. The mechanisms they use vary but TONS of research and science goes into developing the most addictive snacks.

Remember that feeling when you walk into a grocery store and get pleasantly overwhelmed with the smell of baked goods? üòã That is usually an artifical smell pumped into the air."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Just turned 58, til my binge eating and attention deficit are related."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",55 here. WHOA!
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","While that's true, if they're like me at all, I used to obsess about food. I would think about it all the time. If I had a bag of chips, I'd eat the whole thing in one day. 
On meds, I sometimes forget I even have ice cream or chips in the house at all. I can have a handful and move on. I only think about food when I actually get hungry."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Yeah, but then you get the weird taste that a lot of seltzer waters have. I've found one single brand that I don't hate the taste of and I don't know why"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",This. I've been drinking the brand Sparkling Ice. They have a lemon lime flavor that will kill a sprite craving.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Regular soda water is pretty good.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","I use sparkling water as a way to get myself to drink more water, binge eat less and drink less Diet Coke because of how much the bubbles give me that dopamine hit from the sensations! I got a soda stream and it‚Äôs invaluable."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Sorry this is so old but if you‚Äôre still looking my partner bought us a Drinkmate OmniFizz and I love it!!! As far as drinks go I recently tried sodaco kombucha that I love but really any of the diet soda stream flavors have been pretty good üòä
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","I hated CBT. It was like paying someone to listen to me work out my issues out loud while someone else just watched. It was good for developing certain coping mechanisms with manipulative controlling people in my life, so like 8-9 months. After that, nada. I think I'd need DBT or maybe EMDR now. And it's exhausting to try and find another therapist, so I've been putting it off for a couple years. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Meds are weird, Vyvanse knocked me out so completely, I slept for days and missed work. Adderall was great, but eventually made me very angry and I had to stop taking it."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Another fun fact about both: If you ingest Vitamin C less than an hour before or after taking either, it can nullify its effects, so take note of what you've eaten or drank an hour before you take it, and an hour after."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Yeah, I think we are lucky Concerta works so well for us!!"

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Yeah, other than you, I'm the only one I know that does that. I don't know when I started doing it, but starting to get expensive these days, lol."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",The fact that they're your honest thoughts makes it even more impactful to me tbh. It makes me feel really hopefully that I can genuinely adopt that mindset one day. Thank you for taking the time to unknowingly lift an internet stranger today. ‚ù§Ô∏è
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Thanks. I've been diagnosed, and I take Concerta, which does help with all day mindless snacking but only enough that I'm not gaining more weight.  I'm currently looking at prescription options to try to lose weight because I don't want to have surgery when the ""brain seeks dopamine from food"" is never going to go away, but I NEED to lose weight for health reasons."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Holy crap. I'm on 1 mg of Low Dose Naltrexone and it's side effects are kicking my ass.

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","I started there in my 20s‚Ä¶ finished studying and started working in an industry where that behaviour wouldn‚Äôt fly‚Ä¶ substituted for binge eating. 

Lose/lose. Even on the right medications to manage my symptoms, I still binge during certain parts of my cycle or when work is getting on my tits. It‚Äôs a journey but I‚Äôm working on breaking bad routines to build up healthy ones and let me tell you, the dopamine deficit is being a real asshole about it üòÖ"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Genius!
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","That‚Äôs so awesome! You‚Äôre noticing that you start binging! And you‚Äôre interrupting yourself! That‚Äôs incredible! You‚Äôre already doing it! Now‚Ä¶ you just need to interrupt it a different way. Can you give it to a friend to hold onto? Can you put it in the trunk of your car? You can try different ideas. The point is that you‚Äôre so close!!!! That‚Äôs awesome.

I need to stop using the thing that is suppressing my appetite, but after over eating for 35 years, it‚Äôs hard to feel very motivated about giving up this new-found control. As I get better in more areas of my life, I believe it will happen."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",This. Right here. I waste so much
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Yeh macro monitoring is boring as hell lol. Not so bad once you get an average look at what your goal looks like in your daily consumption. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôm not one of these accurately counting calories or macro nutrients. I did it initially to get an idea and realised it wasn‚Äôt that difficult to achieve the foods I needed for my own goal. I‚Äôve never monitored vitamin intake really, maybe I should look at that more. What‚Äôs your reason for hitting your vitamin E, anything specific?"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","It works, and it's worth it. It's completely changed my life since I started semaglutide last fall."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Do you know if semaglutides are ever prescribed for ADHD? I‚Äôve seen many comments from fellow ADHDers on several subs talking about how much of a positive difference their semaglutide made on their ADHD symptoms. I‚Äôd like to approach my doctor about it, but I‚Äôm looking for the most effective approach to take."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","I'm taking ozempic and it has not helped my ADHD at all. I haven't lost much weight either. But it has done wonders for my diabetes. I take 1 mg and cannot take more due to side effects (nausea, gut issues.)"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",I had to uninstall all of them.  Too easy and too much money.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Thank you! I will watch it
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","idk the english name but we have a thing here called ""mager quark"" which is low in fat, has like 35g of protein per packet and is cheap, which would be the easiest source of protein for me that also fills me up a ton, especially since i dont eat much meat and like the taste of it, i love tuna aswell so its a bonus for me.

&#x200B;

i was planning to start a diet over the next couple days anyway  (we literally bought stuff today and want to meal prep tomorrow in general) and then i will probably start going to the gym aswell.

Sorry if its poorly worded im bad at writing lol"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Me, too."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",65 here. Astounded.  Food issues my whole life. Gobsmacked
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Oh I was on Remeron decades ago, and nightly I would wake up at 3am so desperate for sugar that I‚Äôd drive to the convenience store to get a huge rice crispy treat. 

I never obsessed, though. But I‚Äôm super skinny and have eaten like a bird my whole life anyways."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Spindrift is great because it uses small amounts of real fruit juice instead of artificial flavors that taste metallic.  There are a ton of flavors.  My favorites are pineapple and ""nojito"" (lime and mint)."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Try San Pellegrino sparkling mineral water. You can get the plain water, or they also have a line called Essenzas, my favorite is the lemon one üôÇ"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Try tonic water instead of seltzer. If that doesn‚Äôt work, you can also try club soda, or diet club soda."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Get a no calorie flavoring to add to your fizzy water. I use powdered teas and lemonade packets. I've also used pre-workout powders and g fuel. Fizzy water doesn't have to be tasteless and weird.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Same here. Hate seltzers because they all taste like shit lol. I do like the Kroger brand ones, sometimes bubly is good I just bought a lemon sorbet flavor and love it! But yeah nothing beats a nice full calorie coke, preferably from a can"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","seconding Sparkling Ice, i actually prefer it to soda lol"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","Yeah, it's close enough for me to get by. I didn't even drink soda until a few years back when I tried diet versions and got hooked, especially on the Sprite type flavor."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","EMDR was the fix for me (granted, I have some deep set trauma too), but CBT made me feel soooooo much guilt and shame for struggling to function and exist."
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",Lol üòÇ that‚Äôs exactly what it felt like - I‚Äôm like I‚Äôm cool talking to myself and not spending a mint doing it - I got the workbook- good luck out there!
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","for real. I'm just paying someone to ramble on and on about my problems and issues. Years later, it seems like I just keep finding more issues and not resolving anything. Venting is nice and all, but I often get more out of journaling by myself.

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?",It pisses me off that passive pleasures kill you slowly and painfully.
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","It doesn‚Äôt really work like that. Lungs can heal even after smoking if you stop early enough, your liver didn‚Äôt need the break it loved it.

"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","One question (I‚Äôm rubbish with serving sizes), under where it says per serving size on the nutritional facts, it says about 14 per container. Do only 14 of them really serve 200 cals? I mean it‚Äôs good for what I want, just surprised"
"Holy sh**, my binge eating is related to ADHD?","A serving of sunflower seeds is typically about 1/4 cup.  It's probably 14 1/4 cup servings so ~ 3.5 cups in the bag.  If you're going to order some, checkout the brand ""Yupik"" for a good cost to quality ratio.  They aren't salted but that's how I prefer them for the things I use them with.  TJ's has both salted and unsalted but def don't order those from Amazon, it would be much cheaper in store."

Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"I feel you, it‚Äôs such nonsense and people just keep repeating it. 

For the interested reader: in Barkley‚Äôs ‚ÄúAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: a handbook for diagnosis and treatment‚Äù, the first chapter is a history of adhd, and when he gets to the 70s or 80s there‚Äôs a few paragraphs documenting the role the church of Scientology had in sponsoring anti-Ritalin marketing campaigns (COS is notoriously anti-pharmaceuticals, you know they believe all illness is caused by space ghosts inhabiting your body). I think a lot of the anti-stimulant propaganda out there can be traced back to these marketing campaigns. And I‚Äôd people knew those claims originated with the COS I don‚Äôt think people would be so quick to believe them.

And Musk can shut up about everything, not just ADHD. Really tired of hearing this guys name."

Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,you'll get plenty of us in the comments to be pissed too. I can't stand him. He's doing that thing where he walks through all of the doors people with neurological differences before him opened and slamming them behind him. I don't really care about his diagnoses. He thinks that because he has money that every stupid idea that enters his head needs to be put out there. He has a platform and he's using it to pollute the world and play astronaut and shit on anyone who isn't like him. Screw that. Adderall has changed my life and Wellbutrin has saved many people; my family among them. He isn't a doctor. He's a dropout with daddy's money or whatever and no concern for anyone but himself. Listen to *your doctor* and take the meds. People are always going to have unfounded opinions and unfortunately some of those idiots also have a platform and more money than anyone should have.

Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"Suggestion - When you take your meds and are in the adjustment period to a new med, make a (flexible) plan the night before of what you are going to do with your day. It's easy to hyper focus on bad things and it's really difficult to get your brain moving in another direction. Make sure your plan includes some things that make you happy in addition to your typical daily things that have to be done.

Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"Even healthcare professionals like nurses have said absolutely insane shit about adhd, medications, & that it's not a real disease, not knowing I have it & that I am medicated lol. Other people's stigma about the condition and the meds that are used to manage it, used to bother me a lot. But I found it pointless to argue. Of course, it's not great that they're propagating stigma, but a simple answer involving something like:  üôå thank you for sharing, but Idgf about what you believe (or not) about this condition and treatment. No one cares & people are going to continue doing what they & their doctor have found to help their quality of life. No, I'm not interested in this one proven trick that doctors hate to fix it either lol. I usually just ignore for my mental health. Everyone (Musk included lol) has opinions (good or bad) & I'm not going to control that. But I get the frustration. Makes one feel invalidated & angry. But I try not to give anyone that power."

Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"I get why this is frustrating OP. Aside from the fact that you‚Äôve made the personal decision along with the licensed professionals helping you in your journey, it feels like a slap in the face when someone, especially an individual as wealthy and loud as Musk, makes a blanket statement. And unfortunately, blanket statements DO hurt the overall community who find the positives in such a medication each day. I won‚Äôt speak to its efficacy for everyone because I am not remotely an expert in the field, but for me personally, along with the guidance of my psychiatrist, Adderall has been the key. A lot of the issues folks struggle with is incorrect dosing, not the medication itself. I am sure as hell not here to criticize anyone who chooses not to be medicated, but I would ask those same folks to be cautious, just like Musk should, in being so quick to criticize those of us who do take it daily. This isn‚Äôt a one-size fits all kind of deal. OP, props to you for standing strong, and please know that you deserve to do what is right for you and you only."

Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"Ugh I haven't seen that but I'm not surprised that an exploitive capitalist with no knowledge in either medicine or ADHD has a bad opinion about it because of one second-hand experience. 

Fact is, we know why Adderall works for people with ADHD, and some rich assholes opinion on my medicine only makes me feel oppositional to someone I already hated so..
I'm gonna keep taking my meds cause they gave me my life back in a way I never expected was possible, and quality of life isn't something Musk cares about even for his own employees so he can go tweet whatever he wants, I would say his opinion is worth as much as a barrel of horseshit but that's actually a pretty good fertilizer and can be sold or given away to someone who can use it, unlike any of musk's opinions"

Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"This isn't directed at OP, but more of a story that helped me from worrying so much about the side effects of my meds.

Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"I have mixed opinions as a bipolar with ADHD.

I have had horrific and adverse reactions to medications. Whenever I've seen a celebrity experiencing the same, it's validated me so much. For example, Britney on lithium made me feel incredibly seen. I had awful memory problems and brain fog for 5+ years because of lithium. 

However, lots of people with bipolar were upset with her comments as she made lithium sound extremely dangerous. I think because she's clearly vulnerable and needs help and support, people were also extremely understanding and forgiving and also acknowledged she has been living under clearly unique and horrific circumstances. 

Does that mean everyone has same experience? No. Is my experience and her experience still valid? Yes.

But my experience is not everyone's and it's about how you communicate sensitively and respectfully towards others using those medicines. You are also correct that celebrities and influencers need to be exceptionally careful with how they express concerns regarding anything to do with psychiatry, as they know full well the influence they have."

Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"I hear you, OP. The hardest part for me was not going to the doc and getting diagnosed and getting the prescription. 

It was coming to terms with the idea that a part of my brain just didn't function the way it should, and if I wanted to beat it, I would need to take this medication for the rest of my life. I can't tell you how much at first I resented and hated the feeling that I could only be successful by using it as a crutch to be semi-normal.

I've come to terms with it at this point. But for anyone who is even remotely where I was and listens to Elon? God, I feel so angry on their behalf."

Who'd have thunk it?"
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,Jesus christ is he trying to discredit stims/antidepressants en masse?

I don't want to hear a goddamn word of advice from Elon Musk about anything other than rockets, taking advantage of government subsidies, and making electric motors and batteries. His cars suck apart from the drive train. The doors and windows literally won't open if some servos fail, so I had to convince my dad to start carrying a glass breaker in case he needs to escape his expensive car."
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"I‚Äôm so sick of hearing about adderall from people who don‚Äôt have ADHD. Ive never understood why this is something so many people have opinions on. In college, I had professors offer their opinions on adderall. I‚Äôve had friends offer opinions about adderall to me.

I think the worst part is that these comments minimize how difficult ADHD is to live with. of times it seems like the person is saying, ‚Äúoh come on, you‚Äôre just distracted. You don‚Äôt really need adderall right?‚Äù"
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"They are idiots and you should ignore them. Yes people can become addicted to adderal. But statistically speaking people who actually have adhd are less likely to develop a drug addiction if their adhd is treated properly. I'm not saying that it can't happen but the risk is lower for those with adhd. 

I grew up in a family who were avid meth and alcohol users. Addiction runs rampant in my family and I was so afraid to ask my doctor if I was adhd. I was afraid it would be assumed I was drug seeking or something. I was afraid my friends would negatively judge me. 

But honestly being on it was a night and day difference. I've had two gamer friends talk shit about it but I just told them to knock it off and to not come at me when they know nothing about psychology or psychiatry. They are incredibly smart in some areas but I am the only one of us who focused their education on behavioral health. 

I had missed a couple appointments due to some serious grief and because of that didn't get a refill script till after I was out of adderall. When discussing that with my group of friends one did accuse me of taking more than prescribed but shut up quickly when I explained that I wasn't, I had just missed the appointment. 

My psychiatrist reminded me that I can just call in and get a refill if that happens again. I had forgotten that was a thing. 

It's a night and day difference and I'm truly grateful I advocated for myself to try this. I was able to get my diagnosis changed as well. I'm not bipolar anymore. I'm adhd. I still have borderline personality disorder and I still have severe anxiety and other issues but I can keep my house clean again. I can function day to day."

Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"ADHD and the stigma around it is really fascinating to me. I was diagnosed last year (45M). I suspected for years  but put off diagnosis for years due to the stigma and the fear that people would assume I was just looking for a script. What is interesting to me is ADHD is a biological problem. It‚Äôs not trauma or upbringing. Therapy can teach techniques to help manage, but the disorder is caused by the structure of the brain. We are just wired different. If I had diabetes, no one would question my need for insulin. Why then is there stigma around me taking medication that increases dopamine allowing my neurotransmitters to function?"
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"So infuriating. I‚Äôm already afraid to tell my own family that I was diagnosed and taking Adderall now because I know they‚Äôll think this kind of stuff about it. Meanwhile, it‚Äôs helping me so much already."
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"Yeah, adderall is not the worst thing in the world. People with opinions aren‚Äôt MDs. Psych issues are notoriously difficult to treat. Different people have  different coping strategies. And above all adderall  is to meth what alcohol is to gasoline."
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"Personally, I could give two flying fucksickles about what that man thinks.  He‚Äôs an ass. He needs to keep his opinions to himself."

It‚Äôs not real life and basically has almost no influence over reality when you don‚Äôt look at it. And fuck Elon. He was born with a silver spoon in his mouth atop ahis family‚Äôs diamond mine.
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,He‚Äôs never going to shut up. Too many people worship this douche.
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,You could‚Äôve stopped that sentence at the hyphen and it‚Äôd still be correct
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,I have just gone from loving him to hating him in 30 seconds since seeing this posts title
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"There is a huge problem in the tech world with abuse of stimulants and I don't doubt he's seen some of that in this companies, which may color his (wrong) opinion.

It is frustrating though that actual diagnosed get lumped in with the illicit abusers."
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"Let it go, his opinion doesn't regulate your life. Uninformed people will make up their mind and judge you regardless of the person that says that, also it is a problem. That doesn't mean people with a developmental disorder of their nervous system and frontal lobe taking prescribed medicine is, and people who don't want to know the difference will use anything to justify their biases. It is a problem that there are so many people that abuse it, and that people confuse addiction with medically regulated dependency to treat a disorder. The more defensive you are, the more they are sure you are an addict even if say, your taxes really need to get paid on time and having a job matters to you and taking your medication is the only way that the energy required to do that isn't debilitating."
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"Eh. Him talking about Adderall is probably contextual. Did he say specifically that people shouldn't take it if they have ADHD?

Because people without ADHD absolutely should not take it. It overtunes people who don't have ADHD. It's a bit like if ADHD is like your brain having an off-road tuned suspension and Adderall stiffens that suspension, it makes your on-road handling a lot better. But, if you take a car that's already got a stiff suspension on the road and stiffen it up, it's suddenly so stiff its now a really uncomfortable ride and bouncing off the road.

And, when non-ADHD people take Adderall, their focus narrows too much and they get too sucked into narrow topics.

If you take it and it helps you, the chances are, you actually have ADHD, or are at least ""subclinical,"" whatever that means... I think a lot of ""subclinical"" folks are actually clinical cases and just don't know it."
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,ok but i thought that adderall and stimulants such as that actually have a negative effect on people that dont have adhd? i could be wrong though

Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,What did he say this time?
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"Well, let's be honest.  A LOT of people abuse it.  Ever since I got my Dx, I've -always-had ""friends"" who pop up to ask ""can I buy an addy"" and who never seek any kind of help for their supposed ADHD.  When I was in college, someone boldly walked through the labs shaking a bottle of pills around exams.  Unfortunately there are reasons for the difficulties we all experience with stim prescriptions."
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,Right?? Someone should ban free speech‚Ä¶oh wait‚Ä¶
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"I feel like an alternative perspective needs to be represented here. I admit that I greatly admire Musk for his scientific & engineering innovations, but I‚Äôm not in denial of his faults, of which he has plenty.

His tweet reads differently in context of the tweet he was replying to - ‚Äúwhat % of the laptop class is on Adderall?‚Äù For those who aren‚Äôt familiar, the laptop class refers to the group of people who work primarily on computers, which arose during the work-from-home period during the pandemic lockdowns. These are primarily tech/business types. These people have pretty demanding jobs and are also often very competitive with each other when they work for the ‚Äútop companies‚Äù. Elon is very familiar with these types of people. This often results in them resorting to unprescribed usage of Adderall, which is absolutely a bad thing. I think Elon was referring to this type of usage based on the tweet he replied to.

I‚Äôm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt here, but if he is including the prescribed use of Adderall for the treatment of ADHD, then I 100% agree that is unacceptable and is a mistake.

This is coming from someone with ADHD. I take my prescribed Adderall everyday, and it has astronomically changed my life for the better.

To touch on his comment on Wellbutrin, there‚Äôs no context to save him here. His perspective is inaccurate, unscientific and based on anecdotal evidence, which is strange because he is very rooted in science otherwise."
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"Why let some tweet/person 1000's of miles from you occupy any space in your brain at all?  

Step away from computer/twitter and go for a walk and get outside and suddenly after a few days of it, you'll never even think about these things cause you'll not be seeing it."
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,You can ignore him. We all know why you are angry at him lol.
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,Lol Elon does drugs and apparently posted his tweet about taking Tesla private while on acid. He is not one to point fingers and I‚Äôm sure most of his buddies do adderall to party. So basically don‚Äôt worry about it
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,It‚Äôs free speech. He has a right to state his opinions just as much as I do or anyone else for that matter. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è not much to be done about it

Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"I‚Äôve never met someone develop an addiction to adderall if it was prescribed to them. 

Worded it this way because my step dad has narcolepsy and is prescribed it and he doesn‚Äôt show any signs of addiction and follows the directions on the side of the bottle. 

People with the addiction are the ones illegally taking it and probably already suffer from substance abuse. 

I‚Äôve seen a post comparing it to meth and that one made me sooo mad"
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,If anything him thinking it's bad makes me more excited to get medicated.
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"He‚Äôs a human being. He‚Äôs allowed to post his opinions about things. I don‚Äôt see anything wrong with what he said. If your doctor and/or pharmacist dictates your care by someone‚Äôs tweet about Adderall, you should probably find different providers.

I sympathize with your struggle, and I can assure you that you don‚Äôt have much to worry about while taking Adderall as long as you‚Äôre communicating with your doctor. I wish you the best with it!"
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,Why do people care what a rich person on Twitter says?
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"I believe the tweet was 
""Adderall is an anger amplifier avoid at all costs.""

He isn't wrong. Adderall made me such a mean hateful person when I was coming down but when I was on it... wow. That's what it's like to have a normal brain."
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"Well it‚Äôs like the problem with opioids. Addiction doesn‚Äôt just randomly happen. You either take medication as intended and you won‚Äôt deal with addiction or you fudge the rules, fk around and find out. I mean what topic in America isn‚Äôt widely misconstrued anymore? We are just a nation of pure, unabashed ignorance (I speak for myself, too)"

Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,I got so pissed when I saw that. I'm on Wellbutrin and it's been completely life changing for me. Basing medical opinions and trying to give advice solely on anecdotes is incredibly stupid.
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,That feeling when the new overlord wants to take away the drugs that keep you alive. Love waking up to that

Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"100%, personally I had a bad experience with wellbutrin but I'm able to grasp that it CAN work, and people's lives have been SAVED on it. most anti depressants are hit or miss anyway, weird how he picked wellbutrin out specifically."
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"Yea he‚Äôs saying that because some people taking it have reportedly committed suicide, that it shouldn‚Äôt be used for everyone. It‚Äôs fine if he wants to have that non expert opinion but he‚Äôs wrong. Medicines can be prescribed for different things. For example I was switched from SSRIs and to Wellbutrin, because it treats depression but also treats ADHD, which I have. So my doctor prescribed it as a way to transition from anti-depressant to treating my ADHD instead of just treating depression because wouldn‚Äôt you know it, the untreated ADHD was the root of my depression and social anxiety. The only time I have su**idal ideation (I‚Äôm also BPD) is when I forget to refill my prescription in time and spend a couple days without my meds. Different meds will work for different minds. This works for me, because of my own cocktail of mental maladies."

Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,It actually does the exact opposite for me. I feel a lot more in control of my emotions when I take it. It‚Äôs weird how meds effect everyone so differently
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,Same. I had to stop taking it for that.
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"Adderall didn't work for me. But Ritalin/Concerta works great.  After all the posts on here, there are clearly people that do much better on one versus the other because the two drugs work differently in your brain.  It's like people are different and problems are different and it takes effort and attention to figure that out."

Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"Just because you're on the spectrum doesn't mean you're not an asshole. Personality is completely separate from ASD.  Elon is why the ""smart, successful Aspies"" get such a bad rap.  because they refuse to update their social skills and are jerks to everyone. They take their poor social skills as a badge of honor because they're better than everyone else. People like that are why Aspies get labeled as psychopaths by the general public.  

Lots of poor Aspies do this too.  Only they get fired from jobs over and over when they act like Elon does."
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"If anyone reads news semi regularly, it's hard to miss."
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"> If your doctor and/or pharmacist dictates your care by someone‚Äôs tweet about Adderall, you should probably find different providers.

That's not the problem.

The problem is that it adds to the stigma. It shouldn't, but it does, and it just makes things harder for those of us who rely on such medication to bring us up to ""baseline"". And not just social stigma - the average voter ~~is a moron~~ doesn't know better and if they keep hearing that something is bad, they're probably going to vote for people that want to put more onerous regulation on it.

That, and it may dissuade people from seeking treatment at all."

Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"Before I was on medication, I experienced feeling like I do now ""the natural way"". It was ALWAYS in the midst of something major where my different hormones suddenly spiked enough to give me what I needed to function.

And by something major, I am talking car accidents, when my father suddenly died and I had to get back to my hometown 2k miles away and deal with his affairs, things like this. AKA chaos that I can't legitimately handle every single day. I choose to take my medication and have a boring life rather that chase that natural high."
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"All meds effect people differently, I can't speak for other people's experiences but I personally haven't had any problems"
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"Well, as to someone who lived with it for 47 years untreated, I can tell you that you can learn to live with it. I won‚Äôt say embrace it, because truly what is there to embrace? Frustration?  You can be successful, intelligent, kind, attentive (to loved ones), etc. BUT as you get older the negatives of ADHD get worse. As we age our brains slow down their functions, scientific fact, not opinion.  If people can be diagnosed & treated early and not have to struggle so hard, why shouldn‚Äôt they? In my non-medical professional opinion I believe having the medication cause your brain to fire off the correct amount of chemicals at the correct time, will keep your brain healthier in the long run. Overworking any engine will cause it to quit working sooner than one that is properly taken care of (think oil in your vehicle). I was diagnosed and treated for hyperkalemia, uncontrollable high BP, for years. I‚Äôm not overweight, it doesn‚Äôt run in my family, I don‚Äôt drink or smoke, so why would this happen? Don‚Äôt tell me it wasn‚Äôt the stress of ‚Äúdealing‚Äù with ADHD. I was diagnosed with ADHD & put on 70 mg of Vyvanse. Being a stimulant my BP should have shot up higher but it didn‚Äôt. I have great BP now and I don‚Äôt have to walk around fearing I‚Äôm going to have a stroke or heart attack before I‚Äôm 50. Not to mention I can concentrate, forget less, get frustrated less easily, & am generally happier. It‚Äôs not a band aid. It‚Äôs a life line. Good luck to you though, I hope the best for you without medication (and I‚Äôm not being sarcastic)."

Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"Those are the same drug, methylphenidate.

Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"Hate to break it to you, but you are learning and figuring out your place in the world until the day you die.

Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"Everyone is disturbed by ideas and speech that don‚Äôt align with their world view, it‚Äôs a natural impulse to feeling insecure and out of control of the world around you.

The people who don‚Äôt feel intimidated at all by it are mostly people so protected and secure that they don‚Äôt feel they need to worry, and that is a privilege not afforded to everyone. Elon Musk is a very wealthy powerful man, the things he says and does have a bigger impact than something 99% of people say, so it‚Äôs not really strange that people will resist and distrust him. Personally I‚Äôm not 100% comfortable about his intentions regardless of what he says his intentions are, so I‚Äôm waiting to see what happens.

Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"Good question. Thanks for asking. 

I like Rockets and Electric cars. I also believe in lean principles in innovative technology.  He and his companies were a model for many years when coaching my teams in innovative development through rapid prototyping and iteration. 

His Machine Learning project with Tesla auto-driving almost had me move companies to his project. 

And then he hurt his back and started pain pills about a year ago and became a total d-bag.  

His minions (who I was one of them) are the worst. Brain-washed into believing his ‚Äúlibertarian‚Äù trolling is good for the world. 

I get his history. But we all have histories. He is also on the spectrum. I give him some leeway on his creepy salesman demeanor."
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"It may help you to know that he didn't start either of those businesses.

Starship an amazing project!!  I wish them ‚Äúgods speed‚Äù in that venture. I do respect his high expectations and drive‚Ä¶in contrast to Blue Origin or Boeing. We need more of that not less.

Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"Same for me. The reason I like adderall is my high-level brain functions have control over my low-level ones. If I'm angry, it's because there is something to be angry about. Without it I'd be randomly angry, sad, happy etc without any control."
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"Same here. Stimulants do that to me to. Without them, if something upsets me, I struggle to change my mind and think about something else. It makes it hard to concentrate on my tasks. When I'm on stimulants, not so much. I may be a little bit on edge / stressed and be irrated a little bit more often when something bad happens but I can go back to normal and on track faster whereas when I'm not on stimulants I remain irritated and get stuck in a loop where the bad feeling just keeps coming back even if I try to change my mind and go back to what I was doing.

Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"Yeah, but that's a passing comment, and he probably didn't think too far beyond clarifying that.

There's a lot of emotional growth and empathizing that a LOT of people need to learn to do, especially around things like social media.

His social circle has historically been overachievers in silicon valley. He likely knows a lot of people who abuse Adderall without a prescription, or people without ADHD who faked it and found the right doctor just to get a prescription as well. That's the environment of silicon valley.

The Elon Musk hate is way over the top. He gets all the attention, and this takes attention off of the truly evil, shadowy motherfuckers whose status quo he is challenging.

He honestly has traits of ADHD himself:

1. Hyperfocuses on work to the point of not taking care of himself.
2. Zones out when people ask him questions.
3. His eyes dart all over the goddamn place when he's thinking.
4. He's hyper creative.
5. Impulsive and reactive on social media, such as Twitter.
6. Has a difficult time containing his emotions.

Don't sweat his twitter comment. I think it is important to point out to people who read that comment that Adderall is actually quite important for people with ADHD.

I take Adderall, I'm on it right now."
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"The headline yes,  but if you click the headline that triggers you and read the article who is to blame really?"
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"I see your point, but I just don‚Äôt believe his comment will sway people much in any direction. Plus, there aren‚Äôt candidates out there running on platforms to make ADHD medication more difficult to access, so I doubt that‚Äôs going to be on the top of any voter‚Äôs priority list. Plus, the FDA is part of the Executive Branch, and no President would do that if they looked at the millions of people prescribed the medication.  

The circumstances you mentioned simply aren‚Äôt likely, and the stigma shouldn‚Äôt be an issue if one isn‚Äôt sharing all their medication regimen with everyone."

That doesn't mean positive tho. In fact ever since 2016 America has pretty handily demonstrated that it lacks the ability to distinguish the difference between entertainment and relevance. Which I think is part of the problem and maybe why you are getting downloaded so much.

So whatever musk is saying is absolute fucking dogshit."
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,I‚Äôm also on Vyvanse. My understanding is that Adderall and Vyvanse are very similar (I think they are both amphetamine derivatives) but there are some differences in the chemical makeup and such.
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,That‚Äôs interesting- I am way less angry on Adderall than I was on Vyvanse.
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"No it's not the same substance. Besides Vyvanse/Elvanse is a pro-drug (delivers only the resources to build the drug to your body which then produces the stimulant) while adderall is 'direct'.

But if you meant that both drugs are stimulants, yes. Also they both are based on an amphetamin, not on methylphenidat like ritalin and co."

Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"No. My anxiety was terrible before and has all but disappeared since I went on it.

Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"Chiming in on nope as well. COVID and unemployment made my chronic depression life-threatening. Used ACA to get medical help after my therapist strongly recommended antidepressants. I was on a Zoloft equivalent at first but the side effects were too much. Wellbutrin has and continues to even things out for me. It hasn‚Äôt stopped my suicidal ideation through depression and anxiety, but it makes it a lot more controllable and keeps my ADHD manageable. If you‚Äôre going through antidepressants, keep trying. One will stick."

Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,[removed]
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"Personally, I don't have too many side effects from it. I'm on 150xl once daily. The first week or so was rough with fatigue, a little irritability, crazy dreams, and some ear ringing. That's all gone now. The only lasting side effect for me has been a lower appetite. But I can't speak for everyone because if you check out the bupropion sub, you'll see that everyone reacts very differently to it. It can cause higher anxiety and insomnia in some people, for example. For the ADHD symptoms, it does help me focus better, gives me more energy, and reduces feelings of being overwhelmed. But I can't compare it to other ADHD drugs because I haven't taken any. I'm mainly on it for depression and anxiety and the added focus is a bonus."
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,You clearly have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about. You don‚Äôt know anything about the person you replied to.
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"Yes and no.  

ADHD isn‚Äôt my main problem.  I have Depression and Anxiety for sure, I also have a 3rd thing which a therapist told me may be ADHD.  When I first started taking Wellbutrin I started having energy for the first time in a long time - so I started having more anxiety and anxiety attacks.  I was simply too tired to freak out before.  So they gave me Sertaline/Zoloft to keep the edge off the anxiety.

Together they work very well.  It‚Äôs all about balance for me, I took it down to the lowest dosages possible and I haven‚Äôt had an anxiety attack in a long while.  Now I have to work on non-medication strategies before I see if I can live without it."
Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"Well shit,  now I have to go see what the hell bag PR there is on my anti depressant.  

Personal experience.  No.  I was not anxious.  Its been the medication,  short of benzodizpens, that has controlled my anxiety,  it's given me my life back.  

Best thing about the wellbutrin is isn't controlled,  making it much easier to obtain to treat my depression and anxiety.  Benzos I've been prescribed minimal amounts for panic attacks.  

Since switching from zoloft (which had a lot of side effects for me)  to wellbutrin,  I basically never use my emergency anxiety medication.  

Now,  I absolutely have heard of people having the opposite effect.  It has increased anxiety for many people,  thus why it typically isn't a first line treatment option for anxiety and depression.  
However,  it's all hour our brains are wired really.  

In short,  however still much more comple,  f you anxiety and depression is caused by low serotonin you may benefit from an SSRI more.  

If it is more so a dopamine imbalance,  such as the case in ADHD,  wellbutrin may work better.  That is also why wellbutrin is sometimes prescribed in adhd treatment.  

The same could be said for stimulant medications.  Although some with ADHD may find addedall effective at helping manage their condition,  they may find it increases anxiety.  However many others with ADHD finds their stimulant medication helps manage their anxiety  ,  which been likely is two fold,  the chemical process of dopamine bringing more Contentment to the brain along with social aspect of feeling more accomplished,  productive,  etc......  procrastinated deadlines that are due,  misplaced items,  messy house.....  all up anxiety for many.  

If you've been told by a doctor wellbutrin may help manage a condition,  as long as you don't have a history of seizure,  I'd strongly consider trying it. 

It's the first antidepressant I've used that I don't feel like I'm taking one,  I just feel like a normal version of myself."

Also, space access has a major role in tracking what damage and changes we're causing, and working out how to best to do what we can to mitigate, stop, or even try to reverse it. It's one thing to say we need to do the obvious, major changes, it's another to best target where we should implement more localized projects (such as reforestation efforts) for maximum effect.

Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"Unfortunately, a lot of people listen to him. He's got a cult of personality going on.

And sure, nobody's running on a platform of banning ADHD medications. But our medications do get swept up in more generalized anti-drug campaigns because of their classification and the more people get told it's bad, the more they may be made a target in such. Remember, there are countries where some if not all of the most effective ADHD medications are flat-out *banned* - why do you think that is?

And you don't have to be publicly sharing your medication details to be affected by increasing stigma. You don't even have to be taking it yet. How many parents will refuse to allow their kids to take medication because they think it will be bad for them? How many relationships are damaged or destroyed because a partner or family member buys into the stigma? How many people will *not seek treatment* because they've heard so many negative stereotypes about it?

There are ***no positives*** to this, and lots of negatives."

But the point is you don't know, because it could sway people. And the other point is, there is a stigma already which makes obtaining adderall difficult to begin with. And on top of that, there's the prejudice towards those who take medications like that - prejudice from the uninformed pharmacists, teachers, parents and some doctors even. The point is - people who take it get a lot of shit as it is. Having some completely uninformed, very influential ass-hat to spew nonsense about it is not helping anyone."

Can Elon Musk please shut up - no-one needs to know about your opinions on Adderall,"You‚Äôre right, everyone does react differently. If yours is to be in a robotic, trance like state then I would think you don‚Äôt need it. If someone‚Äôs brain is requiring the medication it will make them function ‚Äúnormally‚Äù and if it isn‚Äôt, it is going to have an adverse reaction.  Have you seen more than one doctor? I ask because maybe you don‚Äôt have ADHD but something else.  I have 3 male cousins who were all put on Ritalin when they were young & they were zombies. When they weren‚Äôt on it they acted like little boys‚Ä¶rambunctious, full of energy, etc. It was an automatic diagnosis when (personal opinion) it was because the parents wanted dolls, and not real life kids, that they could play with when they wanted to, then put on a shelf & walk away when something else was their focus. Or maybe try a different medication? Strattera and Wellbutrin did nothing for my ADHD but Vyvanse is miraculous. The way I describe it is when you find out you need glasses. You see fine, no issues, until you put on your new glasses & you discover how bad your eyesight was. I personally lifted mine up & down probably a hundred times the first wear because I was so shook at the difference I didn‚Äôt even realize existed. Taking my medication doesn‚Äôt make me feel weird, I‚Äôm not down nor full of energy, I‚Äôm definitely not always on the go, I‚Äôm not hyper alert or zoned out, I just feel normal (whatever that is). I think it‚Äôs a wise choice to not take the meds that make you feel bad or to not care about anything but it‚Äôs also a wise choice for people who have a positive reaction to take them. It‚Äôs dangerous for you to take the meds where it is dangerous for me to not take them.

I'm not sure how one would take out loans against unrealized tax gains as it is in regard to the gains accumulated and not the actual entity. Unless you are saying that they can take out infinite loans and those become part of this unrealized grey area overall, but that doesn't mean that they will not have to pay the loans or be subject to interest, no?

If not, then he is more on point.

Your level of anger towards him is not serving you. 

I think the biggest mistake people make on social media is thinking that it's okay to ignore facts or a more nuanced appraisal of a situation because they've already made up their mind on how something works.

It's why everything social media related is a clusterfuck. We're not built for it as a species.

Never said he does have ADHD. Just saying he has traits that imply that he could have it.

Like, IDK. I obviously have ADHD because I'm talking about it here, and I would fucking HATE being famous because I KNOW that if I was on social media, I would get constantly misinterpreted, people would misconstrue what I am saying, take things out of context, assume the worst.

Maybe I was just super naive, or now that I think about it, I probably just didn‚Äôt notice it with my ADHD lol.  I don‚Äôt believe I get a high from it. Trust me when I say I can loose my crap, and I get irritated on the reg at work, so euphoric is not what I‚Äôm getting. I‚Äôve never been that ‚Äúhappy‚Äù or disinterested in life or my surroundings. I have also missed some days or have had to go without because the pharmacy couldn‚Äôt get any & I didn‚Äôt panic or anything. I did get irritated but only because I waited in line at CVS for eons & knew I‚Äôd have to do it again. I think those things would happen if it made me feel the amazing person you describe. Of course that‚Äôs just conjecture because as I said I‚Äôve never tried other drugs. Maybe ask to try a sample of the other. Vyvanse was pretty noticeable to me right away but Wellbutrin takes a while to build up in your system. You may also be hypersensitive to medication. Obviously I‚Äôm not holistic but I do believe that there‚Äôs a lot of natural remedies that help too. I thought this article was interesting https://greatist.com/health/natural-remedies-for-adhd#natural-remedies. Of course always talk to a doctor before self prescribing. I really do hope the best for you & it will be wonderful if you never have to take medication.  I would love to be med free but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible."

Are you saying truth doesn't matter, and that it's okay to make a potentially very wrong assumption just because you don't like someone? 

TRUTH matters.

If you want to criticize someone or something, choose an accurate form of criticism that has a much more solid, surefire basis in reality.

Criticize Elon for his COVID policy in Tesla, or his practice of working his employees too hard. Perhaps also criticize him for not being as charitable as he could be, given his enormous wealth. Those are much more accurate, actionable critiques of him.

**Be precise in your criticism and fair in your judgement. Lacking either one reflects more on you than the person you're criticizing.**

If truth doesn't matter, Machiavellianism will take its place. Society disintegrates one person at a time.

> He's also said he's autistic, which shares traits with adhd. Why not just go with a diagnosis he says he has rather than make one up for him?

Anyone switch from vyvanse to Wellbutrin ? Your experience? ,"I was on Wellbutrin for depression.  Didn't do anything to help my ADHD.  YMMV though.  

I'm on Vyvanse now and find it really helpful.  I don't get the wearing off crash that other folks do, though.  I was on Adderall XR previously and did well on that, too.  Same deal.  No crash that I can remember and I was on doses up to 75mg/day (divided into 50mg morning, 25mg afternoon).  

Instead of continuing to up your dose, if it's only lasting 'til 1pm, could your doctor prescribe a second dose for the early afternoon?  Maybe two lower doses, morning and early afternoon will be smoother than one big dose?"
Anyone switch from vyvanse to Wellbutrin ? Your experience? ,"I love Wellbutrin it‚Äôs help me focus and be calm without this heart biting feeling, but I started lost my hair :(."
Anyone switch from vyvanse to Wellbutrin ? Your experience? ,I am on Vyvanse and felt a similar crash. I take 30mg in the morning and 30mg after lunch - it definitely helps keep me going through my day
Anyone switch from vyvanse to Wellbutrin ? Your experience? ,I am currently prescribed both. I also do a chewable vyvanse because like you I would crash around 12-1 pm. My morning usually starts at 5am. Now I am able to break them apart to split up my dosage for the day. Also when I started Wellbutrin she lowered the dosage of my Vyvanse and I‚Äôve notice less side effects towards the end of the day.
Anyone switch from vyvanse to Wellbutrin ? Your experience? ,"vyvanse was too much for me too. the crash mid day is rought and i felt too speedy.

try adderall?"
Anyone switch from vyvanse to Wellbutrin ? Your experience? ,"I was on vyvanse and after the first week I despised it. I tried mydayis and that was the best one, but my insurance doesn‚Äôt cover it and I couldn‚Äôt find a pharmacy that would accept cash & coupons.  I‚Äôm gonna be starting adderall xr with afternoon 5mg booster.  I‚Äôm on Wellbutrin 150mg and I think it helps overall especially in conjunction with stimulants, not sure on its own. Some people in other threads have reported to doing really well with just Wellbutrin."
Anyone switch from vyvanse to Wellbutrin ? Your experience? ,Oh nooo. Like alopecia or just more shedding?
Anyone switch from vyvanse to Wellbutrin ? Your experience? ,This sounds like the way! Wish my Dr would have mentioned chewable tabs? He just keeps upping the dose even though I say it feels good in morning and bad when it wears off early. Hmmm
Anyone switch from vyvanse to Wellbutrin ? Your experience? ,"do you take both in the morning? what are the dosages?

thx"
Anyone switch from vyvanse to Wellbutrin ? Your experience? ,"I agree! The crash for me is absolutely brutal. I tried cutting the pills in half and taking half in morning with water and half in afternoon and whenever I did that I‚Äôd have really bad days too‚Ä¶  so for me not meant to be split, though someone on here recommended it worked for them a while back as it‚Äôs water soluble. 

Glad to hear I‚Äôm not the only one it feels like a lot. My Dr won‚Äôt perscribe me adderall because he said it‚Äôs even worse and vyvanse is smoother *shrug*."
Anyone switch from vyvanse to Wellbutrin ? Your experience? ,Yes. I usually take the 150 Wellbutrin as soon as my eyes open. Then after brushing my teeth I get my vyvanse down. Originally I was on 20-30 mg of Vyvanse but the Wellbutrin helps but not all the way. I was able to switch to 10mg and since it‚Äôs a chewable sometimes I only use 5mg.
Anyone switch from vyvanse to Wellbutrin ? Your experience? ,"cool thanks. I have a consultation next week, good to know both be can combined like that"

Guanfacine or Wellbutrin? Thoughts?,"Im not sure if this is helpful but for the longest time I thought I had depression, but really it was ADHD and Wellbutrin weighed me down and made it worse. I now take Focalin for ADHD and Anxiety and it works really well!"
Guanfacine or Wellbutrin? Thoughts?,Why is your doc not using stimulants? Why is he going for off label and third-string options?
Guanfacine or Wellbutrin? Thoughts?,"I'm on Guanfacine, it works well for emotional dysregulation, but it doesn't do anything for concentration, motivation or attention span. I still take a stimulant for those. Guanfacine doesn't compare."
Guanfacine or Wellbutrin? Thoughts?,"It's a game of trial and error. Wellbutrin helped my focus but made me the saddest version of myself. Guanfacine was great for my RSD, but I was constantly dizzy since it lowers blood pressure. 

The best combo I've found is ritalin for adhd, and lexapro for my panic disorder and to smooth out the edges of the ritalin. 

Are you unable to try stimulants?"
Guanfacine or Wellbutrin? Thoughts?,"My doctor is doing the same thing rn I'm on guanfacine, and it does nothing besides making me tired all the time. I've been on wellbutrin for years, and I don't even know if it helps anymore."
Guanfacine or Wellbutrin? Thoughts?,"I can't be on stimulants and I'm on Wellbutrin and Guanfacine to treat ADHD, anxiety, and PTSD. It also helps with my PMDD. It took months to find a medication that worked with my body and it's been a long road. It takes a lot of patience but you'll get there."
Guanfacine or Wellbutrin? Thoughts?,"Have you tried ritalin as well? Ritalin helps my adhd, but as someone with anxiety, I'm intrigued by the fact that focalin is less physically activating (at least from my understanding)"
Guanfacine or Wellbutrin? Thoughts?,"![gif](giphy|ChmEWOL7Vaz5u|downsized)

After discussing she wants me to try a combination of the two, Wellbutrin in the morning, Guanfacine in the evening."
Guanfacine or Wellbutrin? Thoughts?,Motivation and attention span are my biggest issues
Guanfacine or Wellbutrin? Thoughts?,I‚Äôve never tried a stimulant before. I‚Äôm thinking my Dr is trying to start small and go from there.
Guanfacine or Wellbutrin? Thoughts?,Did Ritalin also help your Anxiety or no?
Guanfacine or Wellbutrin? Thoughts?,"Just be aware she's well off script here. Unless she discussed a health risk factor with you, she should be offering you a stimulant. They're the first line treatment for a reason. Atomoxitine is a fine enough second choice, but her avoidance of them is now calling her expertise into question"
Guanfacine or Wellbutrin? Thoughts?,"Yep, that's why stimulants are usually the first line medication for ADHD, and that's why I'm not sure why your doctor is giving you lesser options instead of giving you the most effective option first..."
Guanfacine or Wellbutrin? Thoughts?,"100% this.

 Hopefully this is because of medical history or co morbidity. And not gross incompetence in understanding stimulants as first line treatment."
Guanfacine or Wellbutrin? Thoughts?,I can't be on stimulants and I'm on the same meds as OP. To each their own.

Wellbutrin fail,"Hey, hang in there. I also was on sertraline first and that didn‚Äôt work right. Wellbutrin didn‚Äôt work right either‚Äî it felt good the first few days like you said but then made me weirdly on edge and agitated all the time. I am now on lamotrigene which is a mood stabilizer and that seems to be helping after upping my dose like 4 times in the past year. I thought it was useless but I think it‚Äôs helping.

Wellbutrin personally did very little for my ADHD really. I started taking strattera which is also an anxiety/ADHD med i‚Äôm pretty sure, and it has been noticeably helpful after a couple months. It‚Äôs not a stimulant, but I think it‚Äôs finally targeting what i need instead of making me a jittery distracted anxious mess

My point is hang in there! the chemicals that are causing those feelings are different in everyone and each med works in a different way so it only makes sense that most people need a lot of trial and error"
Wellbutrin fail,I am on trintellix for my clinical depression/major depression and it's the first med since I was 13 to remove the thoughts of death. Life changing
Wellbutrin fail,Those are antidepressants.
Wellbutrin fail,"Wellbutrin is not an officially approved treatment for ADHD. It is prescribed off label and SOME people have reported a positive effect on ADHD symptoms, but if you search in here you'll find most people (including me) found it to be ineffective for ADHD symptoms. I still take it for depression though 

If you suspect ADHD is the cause of the depression and anxiety then why not try an ADHD medication rather than antidepressants...?"
Wellbutrin fail,"Thank you, I really appreciate you getting back to me on this. I really hope that after my depression and anxiety gets leveled out, that we explore other classes of non stimulant ADHD meds like Strattera!"
Wellbutrin fail,"I think right now we're trying to manage the anxiety and depression since Wellbutrin failed. Psych was hoping wellbutrin would hit two birds (depression and possible adhd) but it didn't treat both. 

I'm hoping that once that's managed we can revisit the adhd options."

First experience of medication and honestly wtf,This was my experience a couple months ago when I took my first dose of Vyvanse. I was shocked. The baseline anxiety that I‚Äôve lived with for years was just gone and I felt so calm and collected.
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,It's been 20 years since my first dose. Nothing compares to the profound improvement to the quality of life I've experienced since being medicated.
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"The first two weeks were extreme for me. Everything seemed so clear. I was in a honeymoon phase with the meds.

The effect became more normal, and more like a pair of glasses instead of a telescope, after those first two weeks. 

This week is a great time to clean your whole house though! 

And if this is you on 10 mg, Don't jump up to 30 just because. See if 10 lasts you for more than 2 weeks. It might and it might not. The lowest effective dose is best."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"I cried the first time I took medication. It was one of the most beautiful feelings ever. My mother asked me to remember a set of numbers, we went grocery shopping for a good 10-20 minutes, we came back to the doctors office and she asked me for the numbers and I just recalled them. I cried because I had never been able to remember something like that. My brain was so clear, felt lighter."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"I just started adderall this week too, I don‚Äôt think I even realized how bad I was struggling."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"I'm a few months in, and yeah, it's pretty sweet.

That first day is a wild ride. I didn't have the same impact after that first day, I think there's an element of excitement that adds to it.

I'm settled on 36mg Concerta now, but might look for a bump up when I next meet my psych.

Even when it wears off in the evening my head is a lot less cluttered becuase I've managed to tick things off throughout the day rather than just adding to the towering mental to do list.

I went on holidays a while ago and forgot my meds, fuzzy head for 8 days was fairly horrible, I'd forgotten how fucked I was before I got treatment."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"I wish I would have this experience. I‚Äôve tried Wellbutrin, Concerta and Adderall (XR and IR) and my results have been much less profound/obvious. The Adderall is helping clear my swirling thoughts (that improved clarity has been helpful) but I‚Äôm still really struggling with executive function, particularly task paralysis/demand avoidance which are my biggest ADHD challenges. My therapist suggested a Behaviorist which I might try to see if they can help me break decades long habits (while also medicated). Good luck with your journey."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"I am 7 months post diagnosis and still on the waiting list for meds üòë

Reading posts like this helps keep me optimistic though for when I finally get them, so thank you!"
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,I‚Äôm afraid to try the meds and go off my anxiety medicine. But I want to feel normal like this
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"Crazy too to think that Ritalin was first synthesized in 1944 (during WWII!) and first approved for use in the US in 1955. Adderall I think was approved for use in ADHD in the early 90's. Meanwhile it seems like there's a threshold for neurology research that's just now starting to be crossed. Brains are stupid complicated, and to really make headway you kind of need three things. Ability to read which neurons are firing, ability to cause neurons to fire (at least in the lab so you can start experimenting with what causes what to happen) and the ability to actually deal with the completely obscene amounts of data that kind of work generates. I've got a background in math and a hobby of keeping up with machine learning theory (mostly around computer vision) but I've had a side interest in neuro stuff just because of the ADHD and the intersection between that and ML. 

All that's to say... I'm really hopeful that the next decade or two will be the beginning of a lot more understanding about what all of this is, and hopefully that'll come with much more effective solutions engineered to specifically help us instead of... you know. Random decades (or almost century) old pharmacological compounds that randomly happen to help us. Adderall was a reformulation of a kind of ineffective weight loss drug, for example. It's kind of insane how potent and helpful these crude tools are, I'm really grateful for them. But... I also am really looking forward to some actual 21st century solutions too.

Congrats on your experience, I hope this is the beginning of a more sustainable life for you. It certainly has been for me."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"I am also on my first week of Concerta (18mg) and sadly I don't feel much, apart from some mild side effects :( In the first couple of days, I got a little hyperactive but instead of concentrating on something, I started doing 5 things at the same time and it was a mess. I am so upset, imposter syndrome is so strong :( I was soo looking forward to it as some sort of redemption but now feel like giving up on hopes of fixing myself."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"To be fair, you're not being medicated in the first week or two - you're taking drugs. Then when it starts not doing much, the dose is increased for titration and it feels better again. Euphoria and effortless motivation are side effects.

Try to vividly remember your levels of motivation, anxiety, and do on, from the years before being medicated. When the proper dose is sustained for months, you wont feel particularly motivated but you should feel minimal bad side effects as well. The benefit to brain levels will still improve your day and you should keep in mind how your daily life was worse before meds.

The extra boost of energy helps me in the morning. Maybe I can focus better, but the main benefit for me is that methylphenidate meds reduced my levels of anxiety 500% more than any SSRI I tried."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"I‚Äôm on Day 10 of Biphentin (Canada‚Äôs Concerta). 
Day 1 - 10 mg (falling asleep like a narcoleptic)
Day 2 - 20 mg, no dramatic effect except noticing I can process an entire thought from start to finish. 
Day 9 - 30 mg and I‚Äôm a whole new woman. I cried yesterday. 
I called it my brain being ‚Äúempty‚Äù and being able to organize my thoughts and choose what I want to think about and what I don‚Äôt want to think about. When I think about wanting to do something, I can get up and just do it. üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
I feel tired at bedtime and am ready to sleep instead of doom scrolling into the wee hours. I only need 6 hours of sleep and am ready to wake up when it‚Äôs time to wake up. Like, I just get out of bed and start my day. 

This all helps with my ADHD, but there are still my ASD issues. They just don‚Äôt give me as much anxiety. 

I‚Äôm 48 years old and am also grieving not being medicated earlier. But I‚Äôm glad. At least half of my daily struggles are gone. 
It‚Äôs freaking amazing. ü§©"
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,Sounds amazing OP.  I really need to get an official diagnosis and start to try a medication regiment.
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,Happy for you! I tried Ritalin but all I hot was elevated heart rate and chest acne lol. Hopefully going to advocate for myself to see if my psych will prescribe adderall FINALLY since I've tried like 3 other meds first. That's amazing that at such a low dose you're having such profound effects!
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"I had the same experience. Cannot believe how different my life is, including my emotions. Very happy for you and it continues to get better"
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,Thank you... This post reminded me that I forgot to take my meds this morning. I appreciate the reminder lol.
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"20-25yr old Accountant here. I myself was diagnosed within the last year, and I‚Äôd just coped with it for most of my life through excessive caffeine, organization, and AirTags. But it was still not enough so I opted to medicate the moment I got my diagnosis. 

They started me on a small 5mg Adderall dose and it was a huge improvement! I finally felt calm, collected, and able to think in a single train of thought as if a mental cloud had been cleared and focus had been sharpened. It definitely just took the edge off as multiple dosage increases were required to get hyperactivity more under control but now 20mg Adderall XR works like a charm. 

I just sat for the Tax portion of the CPA exam feeling fairly confident after only 2-weeks of studying (most people want AT LEAST a month), and it wouldn‚Äôt be possible for me without meds. 

If you can cope, cope, but as someone who‚Äôs coped for 20+ years, medication has allowed me to take on life‚Äôs challenges a little bit better. Glad to hear it‚Äôs similar for you!"
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"Me when I started Vyvanse. I remember I took it at 7am, having to be on campus by 8am and told it takes about an hour to hit. Now normally, I'm EXHAUSTED by the time I get to campus and desperately trying to stay awake on the bus (uneventful but long route). That day I remember getting to the part where I'm normally at my worst but I experienced a sense of clarity and alertness I never had before, so much I stood up because it honestly kinda scared me! I get to campus and normally I'm either running around like I lost my mind or standing up because I'm falling asleep sitting. But instead of either, I was wide awake and calmly sitting down for 10min. My coworker came over, took one look at me, and burst out laughing. She told me the first times gonna have you feeling high and she wasn't lying! Instead of being a bit scatterbrained and all over the place, I  was effective with bagging peoples orders, helping out, restocking, getting forms filled out, and everything. I went to the Student Parent Center to bag some other stuff and got it done in one sitting an hour later. I helped clean up the playspace in another. My supervisor came in to check up on me and looked genuinely surprised by what I had done, she complimented my work and told me that while I'm normally a good employee, ""You're on another level medicated."" My water intake was poor beforehand and that improved massively too, mainly because the dry mouth was horrible at first and lots of water helped a ton, combined with gum. 

That day, I felt ALIVE for the first time ever in the AM and was able to focus. My work performance and academics were massively improved. Unfortunately, Vyvanse can cause some weight loss and I experienced it badly. Dropped a lot and wasn't able to control it or go back up so I had to switch to Adderall XR. Thankfully it's just as effective but the AM hit isn't as strong and I can't lie, I miss it. But I'd take Adderall over being unmedicated and in school, so it's more than okay."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"I do think a lot of people with ADHD have their anxiety from those symptoms. Your head is this noisy space of things constantly clamouring for attention. Stick a regular person behind the withdrawal counter of a bank run 24x7 while someone hums the same 5 seconds from a song they don't like, on repeat, and someone else whispers the words ""I swear you forgot something"" in their other ear. See how they turn out for anxiety."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"That is wonderful to hear, I am going to be starting the same meds soon I hope its a game changer for me too."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"Best of luck on meds! It's truly a wild feeling when you first start. For me the hardest part was like...time lasted longer. Like I'd be somewhere, and I'd have a thought that I'd deal with, and then it would still be that moment and not 5 minutes later, if that makes sense? Like I actually started experiencing time in its actual length."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"Your body adjusts and gets used to it.  I recommend resetting periodically.  If I ever get on a medecine, i want to know precisely what its like to get off."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"That first week is really something special because it really clarifies what is part of the disability by solving that stimulation problem! It also lets you finally act on your desires, that felt really good for me.

The first week on medication, I didn't realize it but I had this long list of tasks I wanted to do in my room to make it nicer, cleaner, more conductive to a productive day. I fixed several small things and I tackled a lot of overdue cleaning. When I finished all that, my mind was clearer when I was off the meds.

My head was not only quieter, but emptier. The computer analogy would be that I had finally found a way to clear out the RAM that was previously getting auto-filled with this task list that, ironically, was preventing me from getting anything done.

 I have so much more space in my head now both on and off meds! So now making meals off meds feels easier. I also build canned task lists while on meds that I can repeat when I'm off meds. I can now do more both on and off medication and I love this! The hard tasks get the meds, and now, the easy tasks are more likely to get done even without the meds. 

It's a cool feeling and this one has stayed with me even after the ""honeymoon phase"" was over. 

TL;DR: Medication let me catch up on the endless task list that had been clogging up my mind for years. Now I can do more both on and off medication and it feels great to me!"
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"Re: your edit, while I can agree that the Superman effect is not forever, the effect is still strong almost 2 years into it for me. 

I procrastinate still, but it usually has some thought behind it now and tends to be the less impactful stuff. Like, I get to make consistent progress towards a few long term projects rather than depending on external factors to move me along. From the first time I started being assigned homework until age 34, I was always thinking I got my shit that mattered done and then went ‚Äúoh shit, how could I forget that‚Äù or ‚Äúwhy am I doing this 3 month project in the last 3 days?‚Äù (Literally was the case in an automation systems class - had to program a logic controller and LEGO my way to a system that worked, muddled to a B- in 3 days on a subject my brain now does A+++ work in)"
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"My first dose of 36mg Concerta (what you have) made me sleepy and quieted all my thoughts. The 54mg dose initially gave me anxiety when I first took it, but the ability to listen to people talk and having energy to finish the day were AMAZING. The effects were less profound after a couple weeks, but the anxiety side effect also went away. I can absolutely tell when I haven't taken it though."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,Oh snap the change is so ridiculous it is uncomfortable and sometimes going back to old ways is cool if you know there's an off button
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,Yea it‚Äôs wild how effective the stimulants are. Been doing the anti anxiety/anti depressant rodeo forever and there never is like a magic bullet there are always trade offs in one way or another. The Adderall just works as advertised no jitters or hyperactivity. It fixes everything and as an added benefit helps control the binge eating I would do! It‚Äôs so frustrating how hard it is to get diagnosed I would have loved to have the ADHD quelled as a child and not deal with it for 30 years before considering that may be the issue
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,Sounds like what i just posted. Except mine is on steriods
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"After struggling with ADHD for 37 years. Finally got diagnosed and took my first vyvanse today. Offcourse despite checking every possible box and people around me as well as doctors being confident I have ADHD (and im the first to spot it). Always in the back of my mind is the thought, could I just be abusing drugs, could it be im not ADHD, could be that I am now in a reality that does not resemble what normal people feel but rather a more elevated and ""high"" state¬†


I took my first dosage and went to dubai mall for breakfast. First thing I noticed wife finished having her breakfast and I wanted to continue to chill with my coffee (i did not eat). I am normally the one to always be wanting to get up and leave and move to the next thing and then when rhe next thing starts I wana do the next etc... I had to force myself to take the last sip and get up


Then I passed the fish tank in dubai mall. Something I passed 1000 times are rarely looked at for more than one minute. Okay cool fish. Oh this one is weird and nice. Off we go.


This time I stood for some 20 mins watching every detail, seeing a bubble on the eye of the fish, a reflection on the lip, the dancing motion of the school. Then I sat on the floor, played some music (specifically dug up this song from some deep part of my brain, i dono where did i even hear it, the its a wonderful wonderful life part is what i wanted https://youtu.be/K4gW_sjeHUg?si=NYtA44nTYpAoyKYU)


I sat for 30 mins enjoying all the amazing creatures in the tank. Creatures i passed so many times and never appreciated, like everything in life its just around me but I never take it in.. im normally on auto pilot. I almost cried thinking is this how other people feel normally? I told my wife I want to come again on the meds and dive in the tank (never been diving but i was just kn a new world). I sucked in my tears


Had to leave the tank/mall only cause my wife had to go. On the way i could hear conversations of others as they passed by, something i never did before, I started to admire the decore of the mall that i had seen so many times before...¬†


I arrived home, wife went up olbut i stayed in the car listening to music for an hour. Very chill and happy. All this while drinking tons of coffee during the day and heart rate/bp staying normal (i walked around with a bp monitor)


After an amazing 2 hour, i normalized but still was far more elevated than I normally would be. But those 2 hours I can only describe as a high (never done any drugs so I dono what a high is), but the feeling was amazing enough to where id say this must be a high ..


I wondered if I somehow could always feel like those 2 hours, im on top of the world, life is amazing.¬†


Just looking to understand if anyones experience compares, I feel kind of guilty it felt so good, I just dono how a normal person should feel!¬†


Pardon my writting style, that's ADHD with dyslexia with never paying attention in class, i trust many others with ADHD just blaber their thoughts with no structure... I dono how else to so it"
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"I will never forget my first Adderall some 20+ years ago, I couldn't believe I had lost, so-to-speak the first 20 some years of my life!"
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"ya it's a really unique experience. 

my first time i noticed i didn't feel the 'pull' of switching tasks. something would pop into my head and usually i would either pause my music, open up another tab, start a new task but instead just completed whatever i was doing. 

i noticed time was different too. parts of my day were actual parts. instead of like one long experience. sort of hard to explain. 

but yeah once you experience what 'normal' is like, it's pretty mindblowing :)"
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,‚ù§Ô∏èa quiet head
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,That‚Äôs fantastic. Less is more so I wouldn‚Äôt up it. Thats where it‚Äôll start effing you up.
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,I just started vyvanse yesterday and it might have been my best day mentally - like maybe ever lol. I felt like everyone loved me. Self esteem and confidence high. Social anxiety gone. I know it will level off
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,This gives me so much hope.
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,I was always forget I have adhd and have my adderall and I feel you. Every time I take it I‚Äôm like ‚Äúomg so this is what it is like to function on a typical level‚Äù!
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,You can freely recall where the keys are?! I gotta get my MF eval to the physician. If I can take a pill to remember shit it's beyond my wildest dreams.
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,Welcome to the club :) Everything changes now.
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"Yall so lucky to have access to medication.  Seeing it help people feel 'normal makes me happy.  

Hope to join you all one day."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"I take 10 three times a day, have for years and years except when I take a couple months on something else every few years. Dexmethylphenidate (Focalin) is better than methylphenidate. Adderal is what I usually go to for breaks, but it gradually makes me more and more jittery and eventually affects my sleep."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"Having clearer sight is so real. I just started Vyvanse for the first time this week. The first thing I noticed is that I could see more clearly. 

6 months ago I went to see an ophthalmologist because I couldn‚Äôt focus, or my eyes would strain. He couldn‚Äôt figure it out, said I have 20/20 eye sight. He chalked it up to head trauma (????). 

Anyways it‚Äôs nice to know that others ‚Äúsee clearer‚Äù on meds too."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"The first day for me was incredible as well.

It's a moment of ""eureka!"" And in a single moment, all of your anxieties about ""do I really have Adhd? Will the meds even work for me? Is this all just in my head, and will I ever live a normal life?"" are all answered on day 1. 

I liken it to people who get to hear or see colour for the first time. 

I'm a month in now and those effects go away BUT, there is still such a deep gratitude for the opportunity to live a normal life and some grief about what could have been if I was medicated early on in life.

Last week, my main fear was around what I would be like if I took a break from the meds given that I have been taking them for 40 days straight. Today is my first day taking a break, and I'm excited to say that I haven't had any side effects. It just feels like today I am not wearing my glasses. 

Things are taking longer to complete, and I get more distracted, but aside from that, I don't feel any different. In fact, I feel better than I did pre-medicated somehow.

I've been micrososing, so maybe it's enhanced my neuroplasticity and my PFC has changed?

Regardless, I feel zero addictiveness to the Vyvanse and can happily take tomorrow off as well!

So enjoy and say hello to your new life!

Also, just remember that medication just makes your normal. You're still human, and you still have to deal with normal human problems. Try to use your newfound executive function to be more organised and develop a wellness routine of good food, exercise, and scheduling to get the most out of it.

Taking stimulants and just going with the flow is like putting rocket fuel into a combi van. You'll just end up in random places for hours, haha.

God bless on your journey, and good luck!!! üôè"
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"For me it helped a lot with emotional dysregulation that has been the most destructive part of my social life as an adult, then the silence inside my head is such a bliss before it was like you are tuning into a radio station but you are picking up 4-5 different radio signal at once, 

now its just one clear strong signal with no interference, also the focus is much better, my temper has improved immensely i don't go flying of the walls and act like an immature child over the most minor inconveniences ,this in turn has also relived alot of my anxiety and has lead to alot less depressive downward spirals.

Currently on 60Mg Medikinet (50% Instant release and 50% slow release)"
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"I had a very similar experience when I first started my Adderall. Very low dose, 10mg, but I was in tears the first day because my mind was finally quiet. I‚Äôm also in therapy, but to actually experience a collected and calm brain, being on task without fighting against myself, not being overwhelmed and panicked by task paralysis, was very cathartic for me.

You DO habituate to the medication, I‚Äôm on a higher dose now, but the initial boost you get is a good time to familiarize yourself with the feeling of being ‚Äútogether‚Äù and develop strategies to help you when you‚Äôre over that initial ‚Äúwow‚Äù phase of your meds. 

I would also argue that it‚Äôs less that the meds don‚Äôt work as well over time and more that we spend our lives developing habits that serve our unmedicated brains and it‚Äôs actually changing those habits that helps us as much as the meds. They go hand in hand."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"I totally understand what you mean, I am 41 years and always dealt with anxiety and have been on loads of antidepressants¬†

I had no idea that what I thought was anxiety and depression was really just my frantic ADD mind. I got diagnosed with ADD 6 months ago and started on 18 mg of concerta. It has been life changing!!! I can remember stuff, complete tasks and function at my job without constant rumination. I am much more talkative because I have an easier time communicating, expressing my thoughts and recalling the words I want to use‚Ä¶ I know the cross over between Add and anxiety is common but I feel like my horrible memory was giving me anxiety. I had no recall!! Yay for stimulant meds.. I only wish I would have been diagnosed sooner.."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"Any amphetamine based drugs Adderall/Vyvanse will almost certainly cause elevated heart rates especially during the first couple of weeks. I mean honestly, these are extremely potent uppers and even when you have ADHD and they have a calming effect like intended it‚Äôs still a powerful stimulant so you can feel calm and focused while simultaneously having an elevated heart rate.

I‚Äôm saying this because this is something that your doctor should‚Äôve consulted with you about and typically these heart racing medications will eventually have those effects level out but I‚Äôm just kind of suprised that people seem surprised by this side effect. Ritalin will do the same thing but it‚Äôs not technically an amphetamine it‚Äôs just a powerful stimulant similar in effect of amphetamines but still Ritalin is used for ADD and amphetamine based medication is used for ADHD because it has a reverse effect and instead of running around cleaning everything u see you‚Äôre able to be still and that energy is focused in your brain and your mind is what you have that effect.

Methylphenidate/ritalin is a cousin of Adderall and was really the original medicine used for overactive kids but it just works better for people who have attention deficit disorder while amphetamines are ADHD treatment because it counteracts the hyperactivity part. These drugs are seriously addictive and highly regulated drugs and should be treated as such.

I feel like there‚Äôs alot of ‚Äúnewbies‚Äù on this thread. Not meant as an insult but I‚Äôm just passing knowledge like don‚Äôt share your pills because I can promise eventually someone will be asking you for your meds and it‚Äôs just not worth the trouble with the law and the fact that you will be black listed from filling these narcotics. Always keep your scripts in a place where people visiting won‚Äôt see them because if they‚Äôre stolen you‚Äôre shit outta luck until your regular refill. Doctors legally can‚Äôt replace lost or stolen drugs of that schedule. Schedule 4 drugs like Xanax they could if they choose to but amphetamines are schedule 2 and over prescribing or duplicated scripts can cost them their CS license"
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,It was honestly so upsetting to me. Why have I been struggling so hard and it could have been this easy. I just got a diagnosis in a new state and I'm trying new meds and it's still hit or miss most days but is so frustrating that my life fell apart and there are medications that make it so much easier to live.
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"Hahaha dude, yea, welcome to the club, you finally know *the feeling*.

You‚Äôll quickly figure out you‚Äôre capable of *so much more* than you ever thought you were, I heavily credit medication (Adderall for me) with having the job I have now. Never in a million years did I think I‚Äôd be wearing an EMT (Student) uniform because of the anxiety, self doubt, and inability to focus, even tho I wanted that to be my job *sooooooooo* bad.

But here I am, figuring out that nylon is like sandpaper on my neck. 

Enjoy the new you, it‚Äôs great, isn‚Äôt it?"
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"Concerta is now my 3rd try. I just got on 54mg and for a few days, it felt super intense ‚Äî as if I was exacerbating my original symptoms. For me, that included my pre-med ‚Äúnot regularly eating or drinking‚Äù issue. I‚Äôve had to be a lot more intentional about putting energy into that struggle because there‚Äôs a positive feedback loop when you do.

It‚Äôs been about a week so I‚Äôm also sure I‚Äôm adapting to the new dosage, but these have felt instrumental in helping my body work better with the meds for me, and I think it‚Äôs something that doesn‚Äôt make sense until you personally go through it"

First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"The first day I took a stimulant med for my ADHD was a bittersweet day. I was astounded at how quiet my head was and how easy it was to focus on one thing at a time. But also sad that I went so long without a diagnosis or treatment. A year later and I still wonder how different my life could have been had I been diagnosed as a kid. 

And it‚Äôs so obvious to me now how much it affected my life because I can definitely tell when the meds are wearing off. üòÖ"

First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"I was on extended release and I asked for a small supply of IR for days that I sleep in too late on the weekend so that it wouldn't keep me awake at night.

First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"I had this at first, then for me everytime I was off-meds I was so dysfunctional it was unbearable for people around me. Then my sleep was so off I never could get adequate rest. After 6 months I had to stop completely after trying to adjust dosage - and to this day I am still worse than I was before. That was a year ago. After adderall something seemed to change in my chemistry, it felt like my body had gotten used to the drug, trying to compensate for its effects and get back to a ""neutral state,"" which in my case is adhd unfortunately. Only problem now is that without the drugd my chemistry is out of whack and it hasnt improved over the last year. Kinda scared about it. I'm never touching stimulants again - for me personally it was a saving grace but in the long run it was just another drug that prolonged facing my mental problems and left me worse off for it"

First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"I am so sad because in my country doctors don't know how to treat ADHD. They can only give vitamins and some peptides, but none of this helps at all.

Posts about how medications help someone really give hope."

First experience of medication and honestly wtf,I was in the car while it was raining when my first dose of (generic) Concerta kicked in. I wept.

First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"Yep, this was me a few weeks ago. I did 30mg of Elvanse but it feels like it‚Äôs wearing off.

The first day was amazing. At the 45 minute mark. I genuinely felt like a huge weight off my shoulders and my mind. I felt very calm and serene. It‚Äôs all my thoughts merged into one stream of thoughts.

I was very emotional. I realised that the anxiety I‚Äôve been carrying, was a lot. 

Regards to the medication,..
I definitely can note when it runs out. At the 9 hours mark it is definitely gone.

The 30g (5 days)had a huge impact 
Then wore off

The 50mg lasted longer and did help.
Does feel like for me it‚Äôs not helping as much. 

I did like the serenity of taking the tablets. Very zen, could get my life organised. And when it runs out I go back to my old self lol"
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"I just started ritalin 3 days ago, and wow, what a difference. It's not dramatic, but sure helps in many areas of my brain functions.

Appreciate this more than I can say.¬†
I was wondering about breaks, and it sounds like a good idea. But for now, I'm sure enjoying how I feel. Yay for meds! üíä"

The first day on 20 I was prepared for my anxiety disorder to worsen ‚ú®because amphetamines ‚ú® and we were using meds as a trial to see if I have ADHD. 

I was floored by my brain shutting the fuck up and my anxiety melting away. I wasn't constantly anxious about all the things I thought I SHOULD be doing while doing whatever task I had at the time. 

I've been on the 30 for 5 days now and am a little more anxious because of the increased heart rate. I'm hoping that levels out some over time?"
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"My overeating vanished and I lost 60 pounds without even thinking about it. It‚Äôs still gone years later, and I still don‚Äôt think about it.

I‚Äôm far more pissed that I spent decades being lectured at and patronized about my weight, even when the symptoms I was seeing the doctor for were entirely not weight related, when all it took was a pill once a day to just not want to shove everything I looked at into my mouth until my stomach hurt than I am about all of the other stuff it fixed having gone untreated (and boy, did it fix a lot of my quirks). Sure, the ability to stop doomscrolling and do stuff is really nice, but I have arthritis in one of my knees that was seriously aggravated by extra weight to the point I‚Äôll need a knee replacement a decade before most people and the only way I ever managed to lose weight before was by being hungry and miserable every second I was awake. 

One bloody pill. I get really furious when I think of all the bullshit I got from doctors about my weight, especially knowing that vyvanse is also on label for fucking binge eating disorder and those doctors had to have known."

First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"Please try Strattera (maybe in addition to the stimulants).  I seem to be kinda stimulant resistant- not a major effect.  I‚Äôve been on strattera for years, it provides a baseline of functioning that‚Äôs more consistent cos it builds up in the body.  

I‚Äôve added stimulants to this.  They help a little 

I was off strattera for a while, and stimulants alone don‚Äôt do it for me, plus it‚Äôs hard to remember to take the pills and they make me feel wierd if i take an afternoon dose‚Ä¶ added strattera back and big improvement 

It‚Äôs a drug you have to titrate and you may need to eat before talking it.  I CANNOT take it on empty stomach

There are other non stimulant options you can try with the stimulants too"
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"I had luck with Atomoxetine. While I COULD technically do things on stimulants, it exacerbated my anxiety which also led to executive dysfunction. My current meds reduced both ADHD symptoms and anxiety symptoms, and now I can accomplish an absurd amount of things in a single day which I couldn't even do on stims."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,Yep same here. Every time I see one of these posts I hate life a little more lmao. Meds did nothing for me but cause unpleasant side effects.
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,Waiting list? Where is there a waiting list.
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,A waiting list ?
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"I am so sorry this is happening to you! I‚Äôm in the US and felt that shortage too, went a week without my Adderall. That‚Äôs really nothing compared to your wait. I have friends that literally are stuck without meds because of last years shortage. Their prescription expired, they lost their health insurance coincidentally, and now they need a psych appointment they can‚Äôt afford out of pocket to get back on the ADHD meds they desperately need (they struggle HARD without it) that they then may have to wait weeks or months for again. 

Good luck to you, it will be worth the wait, and our healthcare system is so broken."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"Some people find that ADHD meds actually diminish their anxiety - like ADHD has been part of the cause of their anxiety. Maybe you can ask the people who love you to stick close to you for a few months while you make the transition. Tell them how they can support you if your anxiety becomes difficult to handle. That way you know you have a safety blanket if things go wrong. And if things go well, even better!"
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,There are medications that target both ADHD and anxiety.
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,I mean everybody is different but the great thing about the stimulants for adhd is you‚Äôll pretty much know in 40-60 mins if it‚Äôs going to do anything for you.
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,Wow thank you both so much. I swear it is adhd that causes anxiety. Can‚Äôt hurt to give it a try especially if it might drastically change my quality of life. The worst part of my anxiety is not controlling all of the racing thoughts and I think that‚Äôs adhd but they‚Äôre so uncontrollable they snowball into something so heavy so I dissociate and freeze and then lose time and get overwhelmed with the things I‚Äôm forgetting or left undone.
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"I literally had no idea! Thanks for the pharmaceutical history lesson! I do love the crossovers between medications and my favourite is viagra being developed as a heart medicine. 

Thanks for the best wishes, I‚Äôve spent basically 16 years of my life clinically depressed with what was assumed treatment resistant depression and anxiety and just experienced my first day without it. If the higher dose doesn‚Äôt also help with my executive function (my number 2 pet peeve about myself) I actually wouldn‚Äôt be mad, I‚Äôd settle for today being my new baseline."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"Up ypur dose. I started on a lower dose too, I think 20 MG and I didn't feel much either, im 37 MG now and it's been better, tho for me I think I need to.change meds, I want to try Vyvanse next. Could be you just need to try a different med, too, perhaps. Good luck to ya, meds can be quite a trial and error thing. Just don't give up. You'll find what works for you!‚ù§Ô∏è"
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"So this is my main takeaway from the talks with my doctors, nurses and psychologists, the executive dysfunction/motivation being fixed is actually like number 2 on my list. Number 1 has and will always be emotional regulation, depression and anxiety. It‚Äôs been 16 years of (now I can see clearly for the first time) hell and I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm here still.

I know things will potentially die down too. But ssri‚Äôs also never worked for me, they just made me fucking numb to anything, like solving my emotional issues by just saying ‚Äúoh by the way now you have none‚Äù.

I‚Äôm no stranger to long term drug taking, sadly fell into the classic adhd substance abuse phase 10/12 years ago and I know the initial high does dip off over time. But yeah I hope the baseline level I have stays. I‚Äôll see how I feel after 2 weeks of 30mg after I start that in a couple of weeks time."

First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"I'd love the side effect of weight loss, I've got around 30 to lose, lol! But I get why you needed to change meds, and im glad the new meds still did the job! I'm changing meds at my next psych appt. I want to be put on Vyvanse actually as I've heard tons of good things about it outside the weight loss side of it."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"I am on Vyvanse, and have been on blood pressure medication for about 20 years (diagnosed at 57 over here). They were worried about the Vyvanse raising my BP, but due to the added support for emotional regulation, BP seems actually  to be improved."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"Yeah today has been a bit of an unexpected wild ride, as I‚Äôve said in other comments, it‚Äôs the first day in 16 years where I‚Äôve not been baseline depressed and anxious. Not sure what will happen on days I decide not to take them (there will be reasons I‚Äôm sure) but yeah always nice to know it‚Äôs a simple as don‚Äôt take them being the off button."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"It was strange, everything had like an extra sharpness."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"Yeah I feel a lot of people are just given the pills, they work, they see no worries and supervision is low. I‚Äôm on a month long heart rate, blood pressure and weight monitoring while my dose ramps up. I have no idea if long term I‚Äôm going to get to stay on them, that‚Äôs up to my doctor at the end of the day based on my results."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"Yeah I have found it a little frustrating finding out 32 years into my life that a simple pill stops me being depressed and anxious. However the meds seem to also be giving me the ability to not beat myself up about it, I‚Äôm just glad I get to experience this, I guess, new lease of life."

With Elvanse. I have a realistic chance to get my dreams come true, because of less imposter syndrome and anxiety and more that I carried my whole life around. ‚Ä¶ and you‚Äôre right‚Ä¶ step by step.

First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"Which med are you taking?   Im taking vyvanse 10mg, and ive noticed higher heart rate, although its low dosage.   I have anxiety as well as Im a female goung through peri menopause, so wondering if another med is better for anxiety"
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,I have the same issue with the heart rate :/ I've been taking Vyvanse on and off for a few months because I was too scared about my heart to really take it consistently..
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,Everything is so quiet! The over stimulation internal ‚Äúnoise‚Äù is just gone! It‚Äôs wild how efective these drugs are once the dosage is dialed in!
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,wait what your brain can shut up? im on 30mg Vyvanse for much longer than you and i have a song stuck in my head still from actually before i took a nap just a bit ago
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"This was pretty much my experience as well. But for me it was more like, I finally had the capacity to just *fix* the shit I was anxious about, and not just lock up until shit hit the fan reinforcing my anxiety.."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"I started on 30 about six weeks ago. I had the heart palpitations for the first couple of weeks or so. After that, I haven‚Äôt had any issues. Same thing happened when I started Vilazodone for depression. I think a lot of medications just take a bit of getting used to."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"see this sounds like it is life changing for you, I'm so happy that is something you've been able to experience. I too am someone who has always struggled with weight, as, whenever I'm alone and/or bored, I snack/eat. It doesn't matter how hard I try, my schedule and eating habits always returns to normal and ruins all my progress. I am waiting on an adhd assessment in January of next year, and god I am praying that I one, can get diagnosed (to feel like the various attention struggles I have are valid) and two if I can get prescription have effects like the ones you've described"
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,I can completely relate. I lost 50 lbs just from getting off my ass and getting stuff done. Then went on to start my own business and continue to lose weight just by staying active. I wasn't diagnosed until age 50. Imagine what I could have done if I was diagnosed at age 25.
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"If you're on an IR pill, try asking for more pills.  You're not limited to 30 on those because they're meant to be taken more than once a day.  If you're an ER pill, try asking your doctor for an IR prescription in addition to use as an afternoon boost when your ER pill wears off.  And then just don't take it a lot.

That way you'll have enough of your meds to make it through breaks because of shortages."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"Yeah, I was totally not expecting anxiety to decrease when I started on meds.

I will say that even if your bullshit makes-no-sense anxiety is helped, you may still get increased anxiety from things that *make sense* to worry about.

For example, I had much reduced social/general anxiety when I started on ritalin, but when I was going through my early training jumps to get my skydiving license I noticed that I was *way* more anxious on my drive to the dropzone than I usually was (mostly in the form of increased heart rate).  I started meds roughly at the same time as I was getting my license.

At first I was worried that I was going to have issues with anxiety on meds, but it turns out that I was just genuinely and sensibly anxious about doing something that could literally kill me.  And the anxiety was gone when I was actually doing the deed.  If anything I was more relaxed than usual because I was not so worried about losing focus or missing instructions.  On the drive I didn't have much to do, so I naturally was hyperfocused on what could go wrong, lol.  And it's also to be worried about your increased heart rate, which increases your heare rate, and so on.

Is it telling that I was more worried about losing focus or doing something wrong than I was about injury or death?  Like, I was more anxious about not noticing the hand signals from my instructors, or failing to pass my check dives, than I was about the fact that I was jumping out of a plane, lmao."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,SAME!!! And my doctor slyly told me after I brought up wanting to be screened for adhd that Wellbutrin (which she had prescribed years ago) is sometimes used for adhd treatment.
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,I do yep
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"It's no cure, but I'm a semi-functioning human which is good enough for me."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"The excitement doesn't really drop btw. 

And yes.  It's like waking up from a bad dream."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"It was a bittersweet feeling of knowing this is how normal people's brains are most of the time and wishing I was different, and knowing things could and will be better for me from now on. But truly, the storm of constantly whirling thoughts and feelings just stopped, I had never known such mental peace and stability."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,This is my exact problem right now. I COULD do things but i dont because of mood/anxiety and side effects from stims.. When i stopped atomoxetin my anxiety got worse and then to scared to start again. So stupid
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,I think in the uk (if this is where they‚Äôre from) the nhs has a shortage of medication‚Ä¶
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"Thank you! And yeah I am not envious of your healthcare system, my quality of life would be a lot worse right now without the free healthcare. 
I have heard a lot of horror stories surrounding assessments and lack of meds!
I am 41 years old and was only diagnosed in April this year, so I've been unmedicated my whole life, what is a few more months? (That's the attitude I want to have haha)"
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,Any in particular that you are thinking of?
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"Nice, that's really awesome, I'm glad you saw such an improvement. I've had similar. I definitely still struggle with functioning on a day to day basis, but before I was pretty much functionally disabled. Severe fatigue and depression and all that is really nasty, no one should have to live like that.

Ah well. As far as amusing drugs go, another one is a few libido boosting drugs for women being explored that were originally being experimented with as a way of artificial tanning to try and discourage the normal tanning methods since they can cause skin cancer. The trial patients reported some weird side effects. It'd be funny if there ended up being a popular libido boosting pill that you couldn't take long term without looking like you're getting back from a vacation to Hawaii, haha."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"Actually, I went from 18mg, 36mg, to 54mg. I don‚Äôt understand why I still have no motivation?"
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,[removed]
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"I reacted the same to Ritalin as you. I don't feel like the effects quite waned, per se. I've also been on adderrall and that stimulant makes you feel like superman and then bam, not anymore. I just got sick of feeling like I could finally think but no oomph to get up and do anything, so I switched back to Adderall. After 8 yrs, I'm tempted to go back to Ritalin. It's different for everyone. Enjoy the good times and hopefully this is your magic pill."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,Vyvance
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"Just a suggestion to ask your doctor about - I take Adderall and a dose of 10mg of propranolol as needed for racing heart and it's a perfect combination. Obv may not work for you, but it might be something to look into! Propranolol is considered generally very safe."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"It leveled out for me over time but I definitely noticed a ‚Äúbody anxiety‚Äù (jittery and just not settled) but once I got used to it, it went away. Also had to completely cut out caffeine while this was going on! I‚Äôm good now and have been up to 50mg and handling it well! Good luck!"
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,I have a generally bad reaction to stimulants (including caffeine) and my psych put me on an evening dose of guanfacine for the physiological effects of Vyvanse. I haven‚Äôt had any increased anxiety and my resting heart rate has actually DECREASED since starting Vyvanse. You should ask your doctor if something similar might be appropriate for you!
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"I don't feel my heart rate increase but I know it does bc I'm a nurse and I check with a pulse oximeter. I only ""feel"" that my HR and BP increase if I exert myself. I'm 42 and perimenopausal and Adderall IR is not for me. It definitely helps me get things accomplished, but I catch myself clenching my jaw, shoulder and neck muscles. When I crash, I crash hard. I get super depressed. I need a medication that has a slower onset and slower let down. I don't have time to get to the doctor tho, so I'll just suck it up for now. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è My meds do not cause me any anxiety but it was a major fear of mine when I started taking it. My panic attacks have always consisted of a bounding racing heart. I'm instead more focused on the moment and don't spiral to thoughts that make me anxious. I'm actually a much kinder person as well."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"Different meds affect people differently, if you have a higher heart rate you should talk to your doc.

I didn‚Äôt while on Ritalin, I ended up in the ER‚Ä¶"
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,on 10mg as well my heart rate was around 110-120. i‚Äôm on 20 now and that went away

First experience of medication and honestly wtf,Methylphenidate stops my songs too.
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"Lol, yeah, for me vyvanse, adderall, and now dexedrine (shortage, lol) all make my anxiety go away, but they don't really quiet my internal voice or radio.

Ritalin/concerta have more anxiety and don't quite make me as focused or ""do-y"", but they shut that internal noise down from a 10 to a 2, lol.  I actually started talking out loud to myself more when I was on those because I missed my internal voice."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,Did you just go from zero to 30?!?! No titrating up??
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"Agreed, this is an interesting experience. I think we're usually so irritated and generally stressed by the noise of ADHD that we don't pay as much attention to threats. They just join the clamour. I also have this double edged sword from meds. My general anxiety has dropped, but I now have very clear sight of some issues that are real concerns."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,Same! It is a crazy feeling
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,This is the correct answer lol. 7-10 month waiting list
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"Wellbutrin, Atomoxetine, and guanfacine."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,[removed]
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"Yeah I‚Äôm hearing a lot of the same from others, good to have the insight. I‚Äôve already been reminded it‚Äôs not magic, and tbh I‚Äôd settle for a quiet head over any other effects. I‚Äôve been coping without medication okay, I can deal with a lack of motivation it‚Äôs not new and not the frustrating part of the condition for me. However I can‚Äôt say the same about the anxiety and 16 years of somehow not giving in to *the thoughts nobody should have*, after these last 2 days I honestly cannot imagine going back to that state of a life. 

It‚Äôs all a journey, no medication is going to cure it, it‚Äôs just working out what gets you on a good level to have some quality of life again, I guess the nice thing is having the ability to chop and change and try things out, glad you‚Äôre still sticking with it after 8 years!"
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,Vyvanse for me was a life saver.
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,Ayyy Team Propradderall!
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"Me too, great recommendation. Personally I have zero negative side effects from the propanolol, but I feel like it might be helping with my phobias. I've heard of studies where it was used in trauma treatment too."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"I am similar to you in age, perimenopause, and working in healthcare. I have been taking 30mg EXTENDED release adderall (with PRN supplemental 10mg instant release for evenings on long workdays) for quite some time and it was the sweeeeet spot for me. 

2 months ago my (new) provider accidentally Rx 30mg INSTANT release instead of extended. 90 day supply too. I really needed it for the upcoming week (my job has a couple of weeks throughout the year that are v long and intense). I figured no time to get this remedied (this was on a Saturday) but also no big deal, a moderate annoyance to split the scored tablet and then have to arrange to remember and also be situationally able to take the other half at 4ish hours. But‚Ä¶

Idk if it‚Äôs the splitting it or what (I don‚Äôt think that should make much difference? I can‚Äôt think of a reason why  it would) but the ramp up and ESPECIALLY the ramp down seem to be ROUGH. And my TMJ shows it. Plus the number of late afternoons or missed dose times that I‚Äôve found myself crying. I am so so eager for the time that I can get an extended release filled. I don‚Äôt have time for this roller coaster ride. I‚Äôve resorted to scheduling much more carefully to avoid the crash. Some days when schedule allows I‚Äôve resorted splitting the tablet into quarter doses to attenuate the up/down but at this point it‚Äôs becoming an extra burden on my executive functioning that feels laughably ironic. 

All that to say, might consider trialing low dose of extended release adderall (or some other stimulant) to see if works better. 

For unknown (to me) reasons, I‚Äôve heard some folks in behavioral health department say vyvanse (extended release I assume) offers an easier up and down than adderall. I‚Äôve pondered requesting to trial it instead but for idk why vyvanse seems to be more often in short supply in pharmacies in my area"
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,Try extended release
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"Thank you, I'll definitely ask about it!"
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,Is that common??? I didn‚Äôt know anyone else experienced that
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,I noticed that instead of music in my head I sing it out loud when on meds. But it‚Äôs not so overwhelming cause it‚Äôs not on repeat in my head.
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,my psych wants to get me to try zoloft but im at risk of seratonin syndrome if i take it so i just feel shame every appointment when she tells me she wants me to quit substance
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,Yep.
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,Wow! That‚Äôs insanity! Sadly not everyone has the privilege of opting to private routes. It‚Äôs a shame that just because some will pay 10x the price they‚Äôll get prioritised‚Ä¶
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"I understand how this could help with depression and bad thoughts. I call those ""negativity spirals"". Ritalin and adderrall help me with those. I was able to stop Antidepressants simply by treating the adhd that went undiagnosed for years. Keep enjoying the journey!"
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"I was just diagnosed and wish like hell I could try Vyvanse as it seems to be, anecdotally, the bees knees. Sadly, I currently have a temporary ileostomy which will not allow time release medication to be obsorbed. I suspect anything I get will be IR."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"Are you able to fall asleep at night? 
I was just placed on vyvance 10mg and I had a hard time staying asleep"
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,Dozens of us!
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"That makes perfect sense, I'll put those on my list to check out. I think it also helps with my phobias, which makes a lot of sense, since the physiological and psychological are so tied."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,Is what common?
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"I wonder about something nonstimulant but also non-seratonin acting - might be worth a try for you? If the Zoloft would be aimed at anxiety or depression but that and/depp is secondary to adhd‚Ä¶ I haven‚Äôt tried guanfacine but that‚Äôs nonstimulant. I recently started taking gabapentin for sleep initiation. And OMG even if my brain goes off the rails at 4am thinking about [any v tangential idea or fact of high interest atm] I am still way more rested than before gabapentin. I take it an hour or two before bed and it acts on the GABA neurotransmitter receptors (hence the name) which basically tells your brain‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúSHHHHhhh‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs lower the intensity from 8 to 2 or 3‚Äù  so the noise is quiet enough I can actually sleep. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs commonly rx for ADHD but given the near universality of sleep problems, maybe it should be more common"
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,Well yeah I bet that would give you palpitations!
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"Actually the NHS ADHD assessment waiting lists are around 2-5 years. So they started using a private company called psychiatry UK that do the assessment and prescribe medication. It's still free for me, it says on psychiatry UK's website it says there is a global shortage of these meds. So not even their paying customers are getting any meds, they are on the same waiting list"
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"Can't tell you which meds are possible, but just to know Vyvanse works by needing the med to be cleaved in the blood cells to release the active stimulant. This is how it acts over a long period, rather than slow digestion AFAIK"
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,I just googled ileostomy and wish I hadn't ü•¥ I hope you feel better soon cos that sounds like a ‚ú®Ô∏ètime‚ú®Ô∏è
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"More than likely.

I used to be on XR Adderall, but then had Gastric Bypass surgery in 2020, and ally of meds had to be switched to being taken twice a day. 

Because the time it takes the GI system to process has been altered (either by Gastric Bypass or by Temporary Ileostomy), IR meds are basically the only option.

At the very least, you said it's a temporary ileostomy, which means you can work with IR meds until it's reversed. Once it's been reversed and healed, you SHOULD be able to switch over to XR meds. But obvi, I'm not a doc, this isn't medical advice, you gotta talk to YOUR MD/NP to find out of this is a realistic idea for you and your situation."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"I‚Äôve been through that. Try taking your Vyvanse as early in the day as you can so the effects won‚Äôt last until bedtime. If I take it anytime after noon, it‚Äôs noticeably more difficult to wind down before bed."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"I‚Äôm actually jealous ü•∫ I take 50mg of Elvanse/Vyvanse and literally lasts me around 4/5 hours. My doc told me I might even need to take it twice a day. And I‚Äôm literally a 50kg girl, 156cm so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm a big boy tanking the meds ü•≤"
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,I think I did. I can‚Äôt remember because it was a couple of years ago.¬†
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,The constant music in the head my head never shuts up. I can be thinking of 5 things at once and non of it is even clear. Mostly scenarios I‚Äôve never experienced or CONSTANTLY going over things in my head
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"I have tried straterra(non stim) and after i threw up from being car sick my (at the time) psych told me ok lets do vyvanse. havent switched since, but i feel like the vyvanse i have now is different from the one i got prescribed from that previous psych. both bottles say vyvanse, but the new one says lisdex whatever its actually called, AND THEN vyvanse (doesnt say the word generic anywhere)"
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"It must just be vyvanse then, is that what they prescribed you? Because I literally got my prescription for methylphenidate on Monday and drugs today in the post."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"Hi, can I ask, did you have to get a referral from someone in the NHS to Psychiatry UK or can you self refer? Thanks."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"I went through psychiatry UK, finished my titration and ended up on 70mg Elvanse, the other meds wasn‚Äôt too effective for me so I had to wait 3 months to try elvanse. Once I tried different dosages and found the one for me they moved me across to my GP who accepted to prescribe me, not had any issues getting hold of elvanse since (I‚Äôm from uk), just hold out ü§ù"
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"I'm from the  UK and went the paid private route. There has been zero mention of shortage and I've tried various dosages of Elvanse and Concerta. My pharmacist orders the day of my appointment and the meds are at my door a day later. 

Paid customers make more profit for the suppliers, so the NHS is at the bottom of the supply list."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,In the US i have had to wait a day or 2 but have not been impacted by the shortage.
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"Interesting, I'll be digging into this in a couple weeks with my doctor. All I know is, when I had the surgery, my nurse informed me that XR medication wasn't recommended. I wasn't diagnosed then, regardless I'm sure there're options."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"Yah, it's an extremely common thing in ADHD brains.  If you find a medication that relieves it, it's a revelation.  Can't put a price on the silence."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"I'm not sure what I'm getting, the psychiatrist did say a drug that began with M but it didn't stay in my head. They then discharge you to titration which are different psychiatrist or doctors and go from there.

I haven't heard anything from them except to give me a blood pressure monitor a couple of weeks after my diagnosis. 

We had a conservative government that underfunded the NHS for 14 years and now the mental health services in this country are a joke and some people can't even get a doctor's appointment"
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"I went to my doctor, told them I thought I had ADHD then they gave me a form to get an idea of my symptoms to see if I might have it. They also gave me an assessment form for autism as psychiatry UK insist on both.

I scored high on both so they referred me. It was almost exactly a year after my initial referral to get my appointment for the assessment."

First experience of medication and honestly wtf,Did they put you on another waiting list for elvanse after finding methylphenidate didn‚Äôt work for you?
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,I tried straterra I‚Äôve been on it for 3 weeks now it‚Äôs a hell drug. I hate it so so much I just threw the bottle away today make evething SO MUCH WORSE
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"When I broke my Ankle during a Labour government, I was refused physiotherapy as there wasn't enough funding. 

NHS underfunding has been an issue longer than the Tories have been in power. The NHS is a nice idea but should only be available for major surgery and life saving treatment in my opinion."
First experience of medication and honestly wtf,"Yep, took about a year the whole process. I got diagnosed then they said was shortages for all meds? So I had to wait about 3-4 months to start any at all. Then trying different medications, different dosages etc I asked to try elvanse and they agreed to let me try but they was a wait and they didn‚Äôt know how long it would be. Ended up being about 3 n half maybe 4 months üßê just to trial a med‚Ä¶ was a joke to be honest but it was worth the wait. Overall elvanse works wonders for me compared to everything else I tried."

Thinking about switching to Wellbutrin,"wellbutrin doesn‚Äôt help me personally with stimulation, much more with keeping my mood stable throughout the day instead of constant ups and downs. i also use vyvanse with it and that provides the stimulation and energy needed personally. i do think wellbutrin is awesome though, it‚Äôs an anti depressant without a bunch of side affects"

Jornay PM/Wellbutrin,I‚Äôd like to hear as well. I‚Äôll be switching to Jornay in 2 weeks. If it works like it‚Äôs supposed to we‚Äôll wake up raring to go take on the world‚Ä¶ or so I hope!
Jornay PM/Wellbutrin,I had my first dose last night. I‚Äôd say I slept like 2 hours max and I‚Äôve been awake since. I got a head ache but never really felt much different besides the lack of sleep.
Jornay PM/Wellbutrin,Do you think you slept only 2 hours because of Jornay?
Jornay PM/Wellbutrin,I‚Äôd say so. My first 3 weeks of wellbutrin I was struggling to fall asleep but after the one month mark i started falling asleep at a normal time and waking up refreshed. Then after my first jornay last night my sleep is non existent. Even now in the evening I can tell my mental state is tired but I can‚Äôt sleep fall asleep.
Jornay PM/Wellbutrin,So it didn‚Äôt wait 9 hours to kick in? Could it have dissolved quicker than it was supposed to?
Jornay PM/Wellbutrin,"It‚Äôs possible, or maybe I didn‚Äôt sleep well because I was nervous about taking it since I read about so many possible side effects. All I know is it‚Äôs been 24 hours since I took it and I haven‚Äôt slept lol"

Thoughts?","My dad likely has ADHD. My mom, the lone neurotypical in the family, is quite often frustrated with his behaviors that are very much like what you describe. Nevertheless, they've not only been happily married for almost 30 years, they also work together and very obviously enjoy each others' company. My mom accepts my dad like he is, his differences have never been a dealbreaker. 

If your SO is hellbent on changing you to ""love"" you, you're not the problem."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","The fact that he said he would leave you if someone more stable comes along‚Ä¶. run. 
That is so disgusting. No excuse for it no matter what problems you‚Äôre having. He‚Äôs trying to lower your confidence. I think you can gain a lot of confidence back by dropping him and doing what you need to do to manage your ADHD symptoms. Self-improvement is so much better than letting a crappy partner destroy your self-worth."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","Oh honey, no. Your friends are right. He is treating you cruelly, gaslighting you, and abusing you. You deserve to be treated with respect.

For the record, EVERYONE has a subjective memory, no one remembers thing perfectly. I assume that if you remember an event differently from him, his memory is always right and yours is always wrong?

He is using your ADHD as a weapon to make you doubt yourself.  There is NOTHING you can do to live up to his expectations, because no matter how much you succeed, he will always move the goalposts. This isn't about helping you, it's about convincing you that you are unworthy, so he can continue to abuse you.


Example of a healthy NT/ADHD relationship when it comes to memory mismatch:

My partner and I both acknowledge that different things stick for different people. What he notices may not be what i notice, and vice versa.

We acknowledge that my short term memory is especially unreliable, but that no human remembers thing perfectly. My partner knows he will have to remind me to do things, and he accepts that with grace and good humor. He forgets things too, sometimes, and it's fine.

We have been together for so long that he remembers things i don't, and i remember things he doesn't. We call it acting as each other's auxiliary brain. 

We remind each other of events and we trust those reminders, because we trust that our partner is reminding us to the best of their abilities and to our mutual benefit.

We acknowledge that even if our memories of an event differ in the specifics, our FEELINGS about the event are equally valid. We are safe to express that something the other has done has hurt us, even if the other interprets the event or behavior differently.

Please get out of this relationship. You deserve better."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","The fact that he mentioned he will take someone more stable right now is a major red flag, didn‚Äôt read all of this but I saw that and let me say that is absolutely not ok to say. Thats way different then just giving you an ultimatum"
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","I get that it might be too much for a partner, and that's okay. It's important that both parties know what they can and cannot handle and be upfront about it. I also don't think asking an S.O. to consider medication to help resolve issues is necessarily problematic. 

But the way you describe it... He sounds like he's being an ass about it. 

He told you if he found someone more stable, he would leave you? Sounds like he already has a foot out the door. This is the one I take most issue with. How can you feel comfortable in your relationship when your partner literally told you he could leave you anytime if a ""better"" person comes around? 

He basically said he thinks he would prefer you feeling like a zombie rather than deal wih your current state? 

I think it's okay for him to be honest about not being able to handle certain things, and letting you know that without a change, he can't stay with you. Better this than him being increasingly frustrated with you, and possibly leaving you anyway. But he also seems very careless about how his request and his words affect you."

"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?",I‚Äôm starting to think there should be a required reading list‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúThe ADHD Effect on Marriage‚Äù by Melissa Orlov describes all of these problems and how to healthily resolve them. She also has a website: https://www.adhdmarriage.com/
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","Is it reasonable? Depends on the complaints. Only you can decide if it's a reasonable ultimatium.  What are his specific complaints? 

ADHD nearly ruined my relationship because even with meds I couldn't seem to get my emotional deregulation under control and was frequentingly yelling at my partner in frustrated outbursts. For him, this was unacceptable. His own damage meant that those outbursts, although never physical, were just as imactful and abusive as if I hit him. We had had multiple conversations about it leading up and I did try but my own methods were not effective enough.  Other ADHD symptoms are annoying but that one in particular,  for him, was a deal breaker if I could not manage it better. I sought additional help. Its gotten better and so far, we are still together. 

Yes, ADHD is real and the symptoms that come with it are also real. But that doesn't give us license to ""excuse"" bad behavior.  Yes, we have issues with time but that doesn't give us license to be late. Yes, we have issues with emotional outbursts, but that doesn't give us license to yell at people. Yes, we have issues with execution function but that doesn't give us license to not follow through with our obligations.  We are still adults who still have to operate in the world. 

It's not our fault we have ADHD but it's damn sure our responsibility to manage it and prevent it from negatively affecting others.

Edit for additional:
That all being said, the more someone learns about ADHD the easier it is to understand and forgive or be more patient with it.

My honey isn't ADHD but he does have cyclical depression.  When he is normal he has lots of patience but when he is low he has very little patience.  This was problem as I have ADHD all the time. (Funny how that works). So, we've had to work harder to communicate our needs and our headspaces to eachother as well as trying to better recognize eachothers behavior patterns. 

Like, when he is low, he gets very reclusive (he is typically a very affectionate partner) and my anxiety tends to take that reclusivity as I did something wrong and my impulse is to react needy which is overwhelming for his depression because he's got nothing to give. So now that we understand each others ""shit,"" when I feel him pulling away, I check in. He confirms that while he's not okay, WE are okay and he will tell me if I can do something to help. I accept this and give him emotional space while doing my best to make other things easier - like make more effort to keep the house up, to reduce his external stress and not ""need"" from him. He, in turn, understands that his depression isn't my fault and is HIS responsibility to manage and puts in extra effort to be patient not make rash, harsh, judgements or decisions while on a low. 

But ultimately,  it's up to each of us to decide what we can handle from a partner. And the unfortunate truth is that some people simply cannot handle the ADHD iceberg.  And it sucks, but its better to know that than force a relationship that will only become toxic and painful to everyone involved.  

For example - I know I can not be involved with a person with bipolar disorder. It's not their fault but that's too much for me. I don't want that added complication in my life. My honey's depression cycles are bad enough and if he wasn't the self-aware and personally responsible person he is, we also wouldn't work.  

Your partner will have to have some level of understanding and patience with you due to your ADHD but ultimately only he can decide HOW much is too much for him. And you have decide which of his complaints are valid and need to be addressed or CAN be addressed and which are just things that are going to have to be more or less accepted.

Example: My former military partner loves being everywhere early. I struggle to be on-time. Our compromise is that he gives me a time to leave the house and we are in the car at that time. Sometimes that means I'm putting on my shoes and mascara in the car. He in turn doesn't get mad at me as long as I am in the car AND if it's a house party and not a reservation, he's more relaxed. (For important appointments, he's been known to give me times 5-10min earlier than he intends to leave to buffer)

Other things, like doing the dishes- we didn't have a dishwasher for a long time and I would wash the dishes and leave them in the drainer to air dry. Even if all the dishes weren't done but the drainer was full, that's all the dishes getting done that night. This drove him nuts. But I barely had the spoons to wash the damn dishes at all. So if he was sooo bothered,  he could dry them and put them away himself. Turns out, he wasn't as bothered as he thought. 

Pick your battles. Address the important issues. Over communicate. Have patience. And understand that sometimes, no matter what, it's not enough and can't work."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?",That's disgusting behaviour. You can't control what kind of mental health you have. They shouldn't be entitled to control how you handle it.
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?",He seems very aggressive and abusive IMO. My husband has adhd and is opting out of meds right now & we have 2 kids. A lot of the work is communication and patience on both of your parts. If he isn‚Äôt willing to do that then I‚Äôd cut him loose honestly.
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","To be honest if my partner ever told me I had to be on meds or he'd leave I'd tell him to go. I am on and off meds for depression. Sometimes they work sometimes they don't. Sometimes I want a break because I feel like I don't know who I am. Sometimes I need to try a different prescription. I'm honestly up and down all the time and even though my partner doesn't believe in antidepressants he would never give me that kind of ultimatum. He says I should do what I feel I should do. I am 6 months pregnant right now and can't take antidepressants because I have Hyperemesis, it causes uncontrollable constant vomiting. I have never needed antidepressants so badly in my life as I do right now. Even though a few weeks ago I said I hate them and never want to be on them again. He still said to me if I feel like I need to go on them then I should. That's real support.

I'd like to add our relationship has all the issues you've mentioned, we are working on communication and being more considerate towards each other. We're working on it TOGETHER because it's not all me.

I have the memory issues and if we have an argument and I can't remember the exact details I say there's no point because you're just taking the other person's words then and how do you know your partner isn't gaslighting you??? He could be making things up and saying ""you just don't remember"" or whatever you get what I'm saying?"
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","Drop him ASAP. He is the one gaslighting you! When a person is with you, he will take you with all of your flaws. He already knew how you were and that you have ADHD  and he decided to stay so if he can‚Äôt handle ADHD behaviors and symptoms, then he is NOT the right person for you. Seriously, you deserve better. I always tell this to people , don‚Äôt feel ashamed of something you cannot control."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","1) get meds 
2) dump him

It is really, really hard to work through a mental illness with an unsupportive partner. Source: I divorced one lol. And he will be an unsupportive partner. He‚Äôs not going to start ‚Äútaking you seriously‚Äù when you go on meds. He will still be a butt every time you forget something. Find someone who isn‚Äôt a butt.

Ps: if meds make you a zombie you can stop taking them. The side effects go away unless you actually eat a human brain üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","To give a bit of opposite perspective to most commenters here.
I recently lost my girlfriend of 5 years after we had moved in together, our short stay lasted only a few months. 
My depression and ADHD symptoms were pretty severe and our relationship was seriously untenable.
She had said it was therapy or she was out, I didn't go so eventually she had to.

From what you've told us so far he seems far less understanding and you seem far less of a hand full than I was.
Medicate yourself if it benefits YOU. If it allows you to have a better relationship with this guy then so be it, but it's primarily your choice and your health. 

The 'massive aggression triggers' sound awfully worrying mate. 
You're not failing; you only think this because of how he talks to you. 
Your friends who see the situation from the outside uncoloured by emotions of love etc can be the best placed people to take advice from. 
If you trust them, please listen to them as they'll understand it better than we do.

"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","There are plenty of comments here looking at the shitty ways he is acting towards you. It sucks, and it's not fair.

I want to give context, to explain, but not excuse his behaviour.

Untreated adhd makes it really hard to hold down a relationship. Adhd symptoms are often misinterpreted, and do make things unbalanced- especially when people have particular needs from their partners.

Me and my partner both recently diagnosed with adhd. She often behaved towards me in the ways you describe when I forgot things or was distracted. Then i was diagnosed. There was a time when I was taking medication and she wasn't that felt unfair - it was like I was her carer. I was willing to put up with it while she was going through the process of diagnosis and access to medication, because I know things will get better. But if she wanted to keep the status quo, I don't know if I could handle it. It seems exploitative, to me, to intentionally prolong a situation where people are looking after you.

If he feels that's what you're doing to him, then he's probably gonna lash out and be a dick about it. No excuse, just how people are."

Adhd or not. 

His standards are his problem, not yours. Partners should accept and support, not belittle and undermine. 

ESPECIALLY if you‚Äôre about try neuro meds; that could be up and down, is he going to be there on the way you need him to?

Then I reread and noted his threat to leave FOR someone else: no, that‚Äôs a hard hard no / red flag. Who does that to a loved one?? Would you ever say that to your partner?? What kind of love is that?? That‚Äôs genuine emotional/psychological abuse. That‚Äôs toxic. That‚Äôs pressure and stress which you do nottttttt need in your adhd world. 

I think you serve HIM THE ultimatum; pull your head in, grow up, and accept me for me, or I‚Äôm done. Because you don‚Äôt need fixing; you might need scaffolding and a bunch of fresh goes to achieve what you want, but you do not need fixing. Fuck anyone who makes you feel like that. 

I STRONGLY recommend reading the first few chapters of The Radical Guide for Women with ADHD. I listened on audible (found last few chapters less relevant) and the first chapters really push this message; you‚Äôre not broken, you are worthy of love and happiness; you are human.

So, your bf isn't horrible for getting frustrated. We all do, even if it's not necessarily someone's fault. But, he's an asshole for literally everything else.

That ultimatum is unacceptable. The framing of it is weird and it sounds like he is less concerned with your mental health and more concerned with not wanting to deal with it himself. Thats not a reason to pressure someone to go on meds. 

And *never* should you tolerate a partner dangling the prospect of them finding someone new/better. Tell him to go ahead. If this is how he treats his partner, he's not a catch for anyone. Its manipulation to make you feel lucky that he's staying. That's never the case. Listen to those alarm bells and get out because if either of you can find someone better, it's you. Not him.

I won't deny that ADHD puts a strain on relationships. It does. But in a healthy relationship, it's you and your significant other *VERSUS* the disorder."

(also, sorry in advance, i‚Äôm sure that some of things i‚Äôll say will come off harsh and it probably isn‚Äôt what you want to hear but i‚Äôm telling you this for your own good and to help you in any way that i can). 

here are my honest thoughts based on what you wrote in your post: break up! break uppp!!!! simple as that. you do not deserve to be with someone like that! 

don‚Äôt EVER feel like you need to be doing absolutely ANYTHING to stay with someone. if you reach that point in a relationship where it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre begging and the other person is fine to end it/doesn‚Äôt care that it could end - you go and end that relationship. if a person is like that, they don‚Äôt love you anymore. that person isn‚Äôt worth your time and love. nor are they worth stressing over. (this goes for any type relationship such as friendships, not just a romantic relationship. don‚Äôt beg ppl to be in your life. as we constantly grow and evolve, people will leave and enter our lives. surround yourself with those you care about and who want to be in your life, lovingly let go of the people who don‚Äôt want to be in your life.)

 idc what symptoms you show, don‚Äôt ever let someone control you like that! if you ever decide take meds, it‚Äôll be because YOU WANT TO and it‚Äôs something you want to do for yourself, not to appease a partner. 

idc how long you two have been together- break up because no one is worth doing this for. also this is corny but true: there‚Äôs someone out there who will accept you and fully love you for you and who will be patient, understanding, respectful and all of the incredible things you deserve in a partner. one thing is for sure, this is not the person for you. 

also, woooow he said you were gaslighting‚Ä¶ LITERALLY EVERYTHING YOU WROTE IS HIM GASLIGHTING YOU. the very fact that he said you were gaslighting him, is just another instance of him doing it to you. i mean the fact that he is giving you an ultimatum to take meds or he‚Äôll break up with you is another way to control you.  ‚Äúyou‚Äôre everything i want‚Äù but then basically saying ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt do what i tell you, i‚Äôll break up with you.‚Äù that‚Äôs not love, that‚Äôs him like emotional abuse. also to answer your question-having your partner tell you that he‚Äôd probably like you more  in a ‚Äúzombie-like‚Äù state‚Ä¶.. yes, that‚Äôs very shitty, it‚Äôs quite f**ked up for him to say that actually.. He‚Äôs verbally and emotionally abusive to you!!!
even without this ultimatum, i‚Äôd still suggest you to break up because all of the things he‚Äôs doing.

please. stop making excuses for this guy. and don‚Äôt make excuses for any future partners. seriously. these excuses are keeping you in a relationship that no longer serves you. don‚Äôt make excuses for these toxic people. there‚Äôs so many great people in this world.  don‚Äôt spend your time making excuses for some person who doesn‚Äôt even deserve you.

side note: there‚Äôs a ton of people without adhd who exhibit the same behavior and traits you do. there‚Äôs people who HAVE adhd, have the same behaviors and traits you do and don‚Äôt take meds and their partners are fine and accepting of them, and then there are people who have adhd, have the same things as you and TAKE meds but STILL exhibit those same behaviors and traits. 

-he‚Äôs pinning everything on adhd. yes, you have it, but some of the things you do may be just because that‚Äôs how you are and not even be a result of adhd. it‚Äôs something i‚Äôm learning to remind myself as well: my adhd is a part of me, but it doesn‚Äôt define me nor all of my actions. 

also, it sounds like you need to remind yourself who tf you are!!!!!!! KNOW YOUR WORTH!!!! don‚Äôt take sh!t from your partner! you‚Äôre out here thinking you‚Äôre a failure? wtf! no!!! YOU are in charge of your thoughts! whenever you start thinking badly about yourself, mentally make note of it- and with love, squish those thoughts! remind/tell yourself the amazing things you actually are. ‚Äúi am successful, i am smart, i am courageous, i am kind, i am resilient. etc etc‚Äù idc if you think this is weird but go to your mirror and remind yourself who tf you are!!!! go say some positive things to yourself in the mirror. you‚Äôre already an awesome person and it‚Äôs great that you‚Äôre noticing these behaviors he‚Äôs presenting probably aren‚Äôt good and that is very important. - i promise you, the moment you fully know your worth, you won‚Äôt even question things like this, you‚Äôll just end the relationship. you won‚Äôt beg to be in a bad relationship, you won‚Äôt make excuses for disrespectful partners and so on. 

you‚Äôve been given the best teacher: experience. you experienced so much from this relationship. the good and all the bad. from that you have learned so much  as well. you may have experienced horrible behaviors from your partner but you know better now. you know for the future to simply cut it off whenever certain behaviors come to light bc you won‚Äôt tolerate it. and you‚Äôve learned so many other things. i‚Äôm sure you had amazing times together too that you will always remember but that isn‚Äôt a reason to keep holding on. 
your life is too sweet to be with someone like that! 


relationships are when you have someone who enhances your life and vice versa. you should feel good and happy in a relationship. and sure, you might hit a few bumps, but if you and the person you‚Äôre with- if you both love each other and want the relationship to work, then, you both are willing to work through any potential issues in a respectful manner. 


keep your head high. go break up with him, amicably and gracefully.  and don‚Äôt fall for his manipulative ways, if he wants to get together etc. just finish it for good. i bet you‚Äôll feel so much lighter :) 

if you read all of this, 1. i hope it serves you well. and 2. thank you bc i took a long time on it lolll  

wishing you all the best!! üíó

But he responded that he would probably like that more than me, currently. Is that shitty to say? 

Lots of red flags here, but this is just a nasty devaluation. 

I'm glad you got your meds. I am tempted to say reevaluate once they are stable. This whole thing where he knew you had an appointment and all of a sudden puts you in panic mode because he can't wait the month it takes for you to do the thing just screams narc supply. 

I'm not a professional and couldn't diagnose online from one post, even if I were. I do think when the red flags pop up, it's worth an investigation into narcissistic behaviors, though. You know your life well enough, given the signs, to make a connection, if there is one."

Yes.

>Because I AM willing to do **anything** for them to stay‚Ä¶

That's a really bad idea. You just took 100% responsibility for the relationship and he's completely off the hook. 

>just feel a little sad about them threatening to leave under these conditions.

He's already gone. It's just a matter of time. Because you've just proven to him that he can make any sort of demands, and you'll accept the blame and do it.

You're in the devaluation phase of the abuse cycle.

You'll never go back to what you had, you'll just jump through 1000 more hoops and lose 1000 pieces of yourself along the way.

Bottom line: The only person you should be seeking medication for is **you**.

You're absolutely **not** ""everything they want"". You're being groomed into a toxic dance that's going to absolutely destroy your self-esteem. And for what? What's so great about him that gives him the right to set all these conditions and have you go along with them? Because he complains? Because you're a people pleaser? Because he sulks and whines and bitches and moans about absolutely normal behaviors that are 100% fine?

Not being able to keep up with long conversations is **normal**.

Forgetting small things here and there is **normal**.

Not remembering exact details about something is **normal**.

Forgetting small chores is **normal**.

You're being completely invalidated and falsely accused for being a normal human who does normal human things. By an abusive schmuck who isn't fit for an adult partnership/relationship.

Listen to your friends. Please. They are 100% correct.

Edited to add:
>Recently, he‚Äôs also mentioned to me that if he meets someone else that is ‚Äúmore stable‚Äù he will go ahead and take that route rather than wait for me. Which to me is very discouraging because then .. what is the point?

This is an abuse tactic called ""triangulation"" where he's comparing you to some ""unknown person"" he's pulling into the relationship, to trigger your abandonment fears and make you engage in the ""pick me dance"" where you compete against someone who doesn't even exist, and try harder to keep him, just because he **says so**.

Run, girl. Run far away. Future You will thank you."

Thoughts?","I would suggest to get help for yourself, but leave him behind. How's he going to treat you when life gives you EXTREMELY shitty situations? He seems to be the type that's only happy when things go his way but when you're medicated, he'll probably still find things to complain about. There's not a ""perfect partner"" we all have flaws and make mistakes.

You're not wrong and if you think meds make you feel like a zombie, you're probably not on the right one/right dosage. Don't give up hope!!

In a nutshell, my unsolicited opinion is that he isn't the right person for you and you'll find someone who will be more patient. Especially because he admitted to looking for a more stable person, he's not as committed to you as you deserve.

And yes, he is using abusive tactics, he says you are 'gaslighting' because if he blames you first then you will feel guilty, everything actually is about making you feel bad about yourself so he can do whatever after your self-worth is destroyed. You see how he puts all the effort on you? You are the one that has to change, your ADHD is the problem (which is basically saying you are the problem). Meanwhile, he gets to sit back and 'change his mind' if someone better appears.

IF he had told you to get onto medication because your behaviors were super erratic or unsafe AND he had not said all of the other bullshit it could be a reasonable request.

You are not *the* problem, you are not *a* problem‚Äîyou are a whole person who gets to have flaws and imperfections! 

ADHD is not a ‚Äúproblem,‚Äù it‚Äôs a neurodevelopmental disorder. Yeah, it can really drop a bomb on some of us, but a lot of us learn how to manage what we were born with, usually with the help of stimulant medication. I hope you can too, but this guy is going to be dead weight on your journey to self discovery. Or based on this post, he‚Äôs going to be actively putting roadblocks in your path. 

You say you‚Äôre willing to do anything and fix anything about yourself for them to stay. I know this is hard to believe because I‚Äôve felt this way too, but **you are not broken**.

In my experience you will still be you after medication, just an upgraded version.  Meds won‚Äôt make him a brand new significant other.

If he‚Äôs trying to manipulate you into getting meds faster by threatening to end the relationship- not cool.  A lot of other ways to support your journey.

I‚Äôd encourage you to get the meds though.  You might just be doing the best thing you‚Äôve ever done for yourself and it may help you realize you aren‚Äôt broken and don‚Äôt have to put up with that kind of BS.

I‚Äôve been medicated for a year. Wellbutrin first now finally stimulants. I apologized to my wife because I really never realized how little I was accomplishing.  I felt like I was constantly busy but nothing ever got done.  She said nothing and is sincerely glad I‚Äôm happier and calmer.  Get yourself one of those.

How many times before this have you said you‚Äôll see a doctor or get medicated then either actually forgot or ‚Äúforgot‚Äù? You mention a lot of small disruptions, are there any big ones like overspending shared finances or flirting/cheating?

ADHD can be a seriously disruptive disorder, and if they think that an ultimatum is the best way to get you to take it seriously, because they feel you haven‚Äôt before now, then they may feel it‚Äôs their only option. This doesn‚Äôt necessarily make it right, but I can understand where they may be coming from.

Story time! My wife has bipolar. She knew she had it for years, and had left it untreated due to fear of medicines taking away her highs. Shortly after our first child was born, she got into a really bad low and threw a gallon of milk at me. I told her she either needed to start seeking treatment, or I would have to leave, I was fine with her mood swings but I wouldn‚Äôt deal with my son being on the receiving end. This worked and she got treated, was the ultimatum a dick move? Probably, but it saved our marriage and got her much needed treatment and was the only thing I could think of that would get the fear and frustration I felt through to her."

My wife did this with me pre-diagnosis. She said she was leaving. She made it clear it wasn't *me* per se, she just couldn't live the way we were living any longer. I went to the doctor out of despair, because I wanted so badly to be a better person but every bit of advice I heard or structure or plan or program didn't help me.

Thankfully my wife was proud enough of me for getting help that she stuck around a little longer, and when I was diagnosed with ADHD she happily told me I was already a little easier to live with. Once I got on my meds she was overjoyed - she had the man she loved almost 24/7.

We still have the odd problem. We've agreed that although I'm a little touchy about my meds, she can remind me or check in with me to see that I've taken them. Unfortunately in the hundreds of times she's done this there have been one or two I'd say were inappropriate - like specifically saying I should go take my meds one day when I'd missed my morning dose and was waiting for lunch to take them, because I was ""being a bit much"". But we're finding our boundaries and building a symbiotic relationship.

I think the main thing is that it's okay for your partner to dislike your ADHD - I think we all dislike our ADHD - but it's another thing for them to demand it be banished from the relationship. They need to accept that if they're with you, they're with you ADHD and all."

There's so much to parse. First, meds might not magically fix anything. In fact, some of what you describe happens to all humans with or without ADHD. 

More importantly, meds are not something you take because someone else wants you to. They're something you take because \*you\* want you to after making an informed decision under the guidance of a doctor. Meds can take trial and error, too. 

But all that aside, please don't be willing to do \*anything\* for any person no matter how much you love them. Listen to your own thoughts and feelings; stay grounded in yourself. Someone who says he might like zombie you better than you? That is not a person worth doing anything for.

Breakups are hard. But apart from whether or not meds are right for you, you need to break up. You might need a lot of support from friends, family, and possibly a therapist to do so, but you need to find a way to do so. There are lots of articles online about surviving a breaking up ‚Äî and even more articles about how to define what you want in a partner and what makes a healthy relationship.

Honestly, even if you do start meds, it doesn‚Äôt sound like anything will change.

Me and my partner both have ADHD but I‚Äôm possibly getting diagnosed with bipolar disorder and he will burst into tears because he hates seeing me go through this and himself feels like a failure because he feels like he can‚Äôt help. THAT is how a supportive partner should be.

You‚Äôre not some broken toy that needs to be fixed FOR him. You‚Äôre just wired differently and the entire goal of this is to cope and for YOU to be happy. He should want you on meds/to get your adhd under control because it‚Äôs going to make YOUR life easier and YOU happier. And YOU being happy SHOULD make him happy. But that‚Äôs not what seems like is going on here.

"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","Quick ADHD-driven thoughts: 

It sounds like this has certainly grown toxic and that‚Äôs not good for you - and you seem to realize that. 
But with respect to you still trying to make this work, consider: 
He‚Äôs being very clear, even to the point of being unkind, in stating that he‚Äôs at an endpoint. Your request for more compassion and communication is not a fair or equal response because, ostensibly, you‚Äôre *already* communicating to the best of your ability, so what you‚Äôre asking is that he continue with the status quo ‚Äúcompassionately‚Äù, which he‚Äôs saying he‚Äôs no longer willing to do. 
(Also consider, someone else might - my partner does - but not him, at least not right now.) 

Of course, your fear of effects from meds is valid - but that itself could be related to ADHD. This is what makes committing to the work of dialing in the type and dosage of any meds so important. 
One would sincerely hope that you‚Äôd have a doctor you‚Äôre comfortable communicating with, who will make the journey somewhat easier; but the heavy lifting is really on you, unfortunately. 

If you do decide to get back on the meds journey though, then it is totally appropriate IMO to get commitment from him to being a partner to you in that respect. Make sure he‚Äôs clear that he understands that this is entirely different from being a romantic partner: he‚Äôs gotta be willing to put himself second during the time and make it really all about you so you both can assess changes, good or bad. And you both should know, getting the meds dialed in doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll be ‚Äúfixed‚Äù - the journey is as much about understanding and acceptance as it is about any sought-after improvements. 

Honestly though, to make comments that suggest he‚Äôd prefer you like a zombie suggests he‚Äôs now beyond partnership. 
‚Ä¶then again, if he‚Äôs speaking like that to bluntly confront your fear with the hope that you‚Äôll relent and obtain the help we all need, then that‚Äôs a little different (but still toxic). Only you can really assess that though. 

Finally, if you do commit to meds, and he states he‚Äôs willing to walk that journey with you, I‚Äôd also recommend that you both do couple‚Äôs therapy with someone who understands ADHD as a complex, multifaceted thing. While the meds may help you and he may even be sincere in a commitment to help, it sounds like counseling will be required to make the romantic relationship healthier.  

In fact, if you have the resources to do so, please consider getting counseling for yourself, too. 
>>>>Above all, you matter most.<<<<

I really feel for you and you clearly need an advocate right now. Ultimately, meds can only do so much and this experience will require a lot of processing I expect.

Hint: you‚Äôre good enough to deal with. With or
Without medication.

Ultimatums like that only escalate, because you're giving up your autonomy to keep the relationship. You're proving that he's allowed that degree of control over your life by simply existing in it. What comes next is refusing to participate in the relationship unless you act a certain way in public/ in front of people. Then isolation from your support network. Then financial control. If you're lucky, it doesn't escalate to physical violence, but you're still trapped with a man who doesn't respect you. It may not even be malicious in his head, is the worst part, he'll see it as ""taking care of you"". But trust me, if this is where he draws the line,  he's giving you an out, take it. 

He literally admitted that he'd like you better without a personality? Without the capacity to make your own decisions, without your emotional depth? 

Yes,  incredibly shitty to say. Your friends are right,  he's not treating you like a partner."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","I will start by saying that, for some folks, being in a relationship with someone with untreated (or even treated) ADHD is not going to work for them. If your boyfriend has realized that he's not compatible with untreated ADHD, then it's reasonable for him to establish a boundary around that.

# BIG FUCKING HOWEVER

Your boyfriend sounds like an abusive piece of shit. 

>occasional inconveniences have turned into massive aggression triggers for him

If he is not compatible with the occasional inconveniences of being in a relationship with someone with ADHD, then fine, but your behavior does not justify someone else's relational aggression. Period. He can say that it bothers him, he can set boundaries, he can leave. But using that to justify aggression towards you is abuse. There's so much more here that I don't have time to write paragraphs on, so I'll try to summarize:

* It sounds like he's blaming your disability for his behavior. That's manipulative and an abuse tactic.
* Making you feel like you are the source of the problems in your relationship is an abuse tactic.
* Making ultimatums is an abuse tactic. The difference between an ultimatum and a boundary is subtle but SO important.
* Making you feel unvalued or otherwise ""negging"" you by saying he would leave you for someone ""more stable"" is an abuse tactic. He's both a) calling you unstable, and b) telling you that you have no more value to him than a stranger. Fuck that noise. You should be the only one in the world for him. The apple of his god damn eye. You're special, and if he doesn't see that, you deserve better.
* Your friends say he's using abuse tactics?? Then he's DEFINITELY using abuse tactics. If it's bad enough for them to notice, it's definitely bad enough for you to leave.
* Saying he'd prefer you as a zombie than the way you are now. Same as above, if he's saying he'd prefer you be different, that's an abuse tactic. He doesn't get to tell you how to be.
* The fact that you're ""willing to do anything for him to stay"" is a sign you've already been manipulated by him. People in happy, healthy relationships don't say shit like that. They talk about working through problems together and having healthy boundaries and being willing to stick with the other person while they work on their shit. It's not on you to earn his loyalty. If he loves you, it's on him to stick with you while you deal with your ADHD. Which, by the way, you should be doing for yourself and not for someone else.

We don't get to tell the people we love how they need to change in order to suit us best. I'm not saying don't change or improve. We are all aware of our own faults, shortcomings, and quirks, but each person's life journey is to get better and improve in the areas they see for themselves, not according to someone else. I don't get to pick those areas in my wife and point them out to her, nor does she for me. When we love people, we stick with them and provide support while they work on the shit they want to work on--not for us, but for themselves. If your partner has something about them that bothers you, then that's your area to improve, not theirs. Don't put up with someone who thinks they have the right to tell you what you need to fix. Don't put up with someone who thinks that your ADHD bothering them is your job to fix and not theirs. That's bullshit. Find someone who loves and supports you while you're fixing what you want to fix for you and will work on themselves at the same time."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","Speaking as someone with ADHD: Do I think it's fair of a partner to decide to leave someone because they find the symptoms of someone's condition or differences intolerable? Yes, actually. Does it hurt? Yes. 

Do I think it's fair for a partner to deliver an ultimatum: I need you to try to manage your condition with medication or else I'm leaving? Actually, yes. We cannot demand that our partners put up with our symptoms. We may wish they were the type of person who could, but what they are telling us is: I'm not that type of person, at this moment, for you. Again, it hurts, but that's okay. Not everyone is that person, and it doesn't make them bad or evil. 

Still, even though the partner is threatening to leave you and demanding that you change, don't lose sight of the fact that you have power in this situation, too. They are communicating their needs, and you have every right to say, ""no, I cannot do that for you,  and I hope to find a partner who is more patient with my symptoms than you. So I guess we're done here."" You are not the ""weaker"" or more ""dysfunctional"" person in this situation. 

That being said, I think there are some red flags here. I think its possible that a partner could communicate all of this to you in a healthy, loving way, one that respects and accepts you for who you are at this moment while also holding out and pushing you in the direction of taking steps towards something that might help you, and, by extension, the relationship. Even if they are saying ""this needs to change or I'm leaving"", even that message could be delivered with love and compassion.

That is not what I'm sensing here. Dismissive comments about your fears, telling you you don't care, telling you that you are ""making excuses"", threatening to run off with someone else. These are not the signs of a healthy, loving person who is committed to seeing you thrive. Even if medication helps your ADHD, something tells me this person is just going to find something else wrong with you a few months down the road. 

This is the mindfuck of ADHD (or any misunderstood disabilities for that matter)-- we get really good at rationalizing people's shitty behavior and placing the blame on us. You have a condition-- perhaps it needs better management and yes, it can be a dealbreaker for some people (I do not subscribe to what you'll no-doubt hear people say in this thread-- 'well if if he really loved you he would have no problem'-- we have a condition that can affect other people and some people can't handle it! That's okay! Denying that reality generates in us a victim mindset) and that's okay. 

But we don't have to make any excuse for people treating us like shit because of our condition. We all deserve respect, love, and compassion, no matter what-- all of which can exist, even in the midst of a breakup or an ultimatum. But your partner doesn't seem capable of it. Maybe he's showing you who he really is. Do you want to stay with someone like that?"

Not to mention it took YEARS to dial in medication and get the right one so that I was feeling my best. This person is not healthy or good for you. They‚Äôre treating you horribly. Someone who really loves you will accept you with your adhd and not use it like you‚Äôre some kind of horrible person.

Thoughts?","I came with quite an open mind here because I had a gf that needed a lot of order and me being disorganised was actually a problem in our relationship...

With all honesty I don't like what I've read, there are a lot of red flags here that say you should get away from this person.

The change in attitude, first very understanding and later it being the main problem, ""agression triggers"", manipulation, emotional too, and putting all the blame in you. There is also the pattern of criticism/compliments like saying he would like you more as a zombie. This would be an indicator of risk of partner abuse, with the gaslightning being another. Other indicators would be emotional attacks, harsh words and similar followed by compliments, gifts or other aparent shows of love.

I think you should analize his behaviour carefully and thing if these things apply and even if they don't, talk with your family and friends and keep I contact with them, keep them imformed of how things go with your partner, specially if your boyfriend opposes to you being in contact with friends or family. Isolation of the victim is a massive red flag and if it were to happen, get away.

I'm not telling you this to scare you, I don't know you two, I just want you to be aware that some behaviours are warnings and to make sure you keep yourself safe... I know a bit of what I'm talking about, and I know it may sound exaggerated, but just keep yourself safe and maintain communication with your family and friends

Our strategies for navigating the world, relationships, and ourselves is defined in part by that because our personality organizes around those strategies. You are not your ADHD, but it is a part of you.  Living with ADHD is hard as it is, but hard things in life can be easier when we have people we love and support us.  He doesn‚Äôt have to understand what it is like to have ADHD, but he needs to want to understand, to be curious.  However, he sounds like he only cares about how your ADHD affects him.  

Second, it sounds like you are compromising and giving more to the relationship than you are getting.  That may be because you have a distorted view of your own value, which your partner is contributing to.  You are willing to get medication because he demands it.  Oh no, suddenly it‚Äôs not fast enough for him.  He reserves the option to leave you if he meets someone he likes more.  No.  Just no.  I recognize that personality type and if it wasn‚Äôt getting medicine for ADHD, it would be something else.  

Lastly, what you wrote hit home for me, and I feel sure I‚Äôm not the only one.  Especially the part about feeling like a failure, and being willing to move mountains to fix a relationship.  But you deserve treatment for your ADHD on your terms, and whether that looks like medicine or therapy should be between you and a counselor.  You deserve a supportive partner who will treat you like a treasure and not a placeholder.  My advice is to update your okcupid account and tell that guy good luck finding someone better."

# No.

## You are not a failure.

The only failure in your relationship is that guy failing to be a decent partner for you.

In a healthy relationship you should be able to have an honest, adult, conversation about any of the things you mentioned. Him refusing to talk about them is him being immature.

Him withholding the small amount of compassion needed to fix a lot of these issues between you guys sounds like him being cruel or a textbook abusive tactic. Either way he doesn't sound like a guy you want to be with.

Him being ready to leave at a moment's notice is abhorrent behavior from him. I'll leave that detailed explanation to other comments that have done it better than I can.

Lets tally it up:

* Childish behavior
* Textbook abusive behavior
* More abusive behavior
* ""My friends say these are abusive tactics""
* **""All these alarms are ringing""**

You are not overreacting. This sounds like either an abusive relationship or laying the groundwork for abuse. Even if it isn't abusive, it still isn't healthy. I know the internet like to suggest extreme action, but this is one of the cases where dumping him asap seems like the right choice instead of an overreaction of any sort.

**Don't put up with this guy treating you like garbage, find someone who actually cares about you.**"

Fellow ADHDer who has also had a lot of experience working with people in abusive relationships. I know that I don't have the full information here but, from the way you're describing your relationship, it sounds like there are a number of red flags. First and foremost, when you're saying ""aggression triggers"" what does that look like exactly? Is your partner yelling at you, calling you names, putting you down, throwing or hitting things around you? Does the aggression involve hitting, pushing, or threatening you or people you love? Second, it sounds like they're putting all the blame on you (through your ADHD dx) for the things that go wrong in the relationship and their poor behaviour. Even though our symptoms can create significant challenges for our loved ones, that doesn't ever excuse abuse or threats, everyone has to be responsible for their behaviour and their choices. Lastly, if your partner is ready to leave you when someone ""more stable"" comes along, that seems like a pretty clear indication that they are not someone who is committed to the relationship. I don't want to make accusations but this sort of attitude sets the stage to blame you for their infidelity later on, almost like they're doing it pre-emptively. If he gets with someone else, that is a result of his choice and not your mental stability. I'm happy to discuss this more or to help you access free/low fee services in your area to help with this if you want to send me a DM.

"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","If you're really ""everything they want"" then your partner would take you seriously even without medication. You are who you are, even with the little ""quirks"" that come with ADHD. First and foremost is your happiness. If you really hate medication that much because it makes you feel like a zombie, that is a very valid reason to be hesitant! For him to say he'd probably like you better as a zombie is like...really not good. 

And another thing...he really couldn't wait one month for your appointment? Like what? Expediting the way you did could have actually ended up hurting you getting meds since it's a controlled substance. The doctor could have been like ""oh you're just trying to get drugs faster, so no meds for you"". I'm not blaming you here but him making you expedite like that is horrible for him to do to you, especially if you weren't hesitant to go on meds in the first place! Its not like you didn't even have an appointment right? 

Also, the decision to leave him or not is totally yours. None of us here in your comments sees your entire relationship. Although based solely on what you said here, I would suggest just leaving him."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","What else have you had to ""fix"" for this partner? Your friends are right. These are abusive behaviours. Your choice to use or not use medication is yours alone. Anyone who thinks that it's ok to A) give you an ultimatum that forces you to take them and B) says that the side effects YOU suffer are acceptable (apparently preferable in this case) to THEM, and therefore you should do it, needs to fuck off into the sea. This person does not deserve your respect, as they are not treating you with respect. It might be hard to fathom from your current point of view, but you ARE better off without that person than with them. The demands to change yourself to suit them will never stop. This time they've just upped the ante. That pattern will continue if you don't cut things off right now. You say you love this person, and I believe you think you do. In reality, your self esteem is low (from a combination of living with ADHD and all that entails, plus being with a partner who has systematically lowered your self esteem by expecting you to change for them) and you think you can't be happy on your own. ADHD does that to people. Unfortunately, there are people out there who take advantage of that. Listen to the alarm bells, they are there for a reason and you need to stop gaslighting yourself and saying ""it's ok, I'm just overreacting"". If anything, they've made it easy for you by giving you an ultimatum. The answer to an ultimatum is ""good bye and good luck"". No one has the right to corner you into medication that you don't want. Ask yourself: does this person change themselves for you? Would you ever feel like it was ok to ask them to change? Would you give this ultimatum to someone?"

And I think that's been going on for a while. The impulsivity that comes with ADHD, often goes at the expense of empathy, in my experience. 

There's no right or wrong. You don't have to take meds, but that means he doesn't need to be in the relationship. He is unhappy.

My ex-partner was so invalidating of my hurt, saying he‚Äôd never done/said X thing before when I knew he had. I let him know when we first started dating that I‚Äôd rely on him to remember shared events/just remind me a couple times, but he‚Äôd get so angry when I wouldn‚Äôt remember, even if it had only been mentioned in passing or he‚Äôd never reminded me. He said I was childish for needing fidget toys. My blunt advice: dump the extra weight. It was the best thing I ever did.

It‚Äôs extremely manipulative gaslighting. People who are ok with that behavior will not change. Not for you, not for anyone.

Now, all this being said. I got medicated earlier this summer and it was also an amazing decision (FOR ME). We don‚Äôt call adults who use bumper lanes in bowling ‚Äòfailures‚Äô.

no. that's fucking dumb. especially considering how difficult it can be to get these meds, he's basically threatening to break up with you if you don't exhibit drug-seeking behavior which is only gonna make it more difficult to find meds if that label ends up on your file. 

'I know you're doing what you can to improve your life in the face of adversity, but... you're not doing it fast enough for me, someone who doesn't have to live with your struggles.'

Thoughts?","Telling you that you need to work on improving yourself and your relationship is one thing.  Telling you that you need to fix it with meds now, or they are going to leave you, is manipulation.  The fact that he told you he would be willing to leave you for someone more stable regardless tells me that he's already got one foot out the door.  I hate to say it, but you might be best to let him go.  It's hard I know, but it's going to be even harder when you do everything to better yourself only to find out he's leaving you anyway.  
Meds are only a piece of the puzzle.  They may bring some things into focus, but they don't outright fix everything.  You are still going to forget chores, you are still going to recall things incorrectly, and you are most likely still going to try and explain your intentions.  Medication won't stop these things. Only by changing habits and making major life changes such as lists, taking notes and/or recording important events, and working on how you apologize for things (you should google: thank you vs I'm sorry) will things really change.  These things will all take time, and probably a lot of it.  If your partner isn't patient with you now, they certainly won't be after you still have some issues after getting medicated."

I was in an emotionally abusive relationship for a very short amount of time, but it changed me forever. It started to get physical, so I left.

It sounds like he's not good for you, you know it, your friends know it. I know this may seem harsh coming from a stranger, and I'm sorry.

When you start questioning yourself so much that you decide you're 'overreacting,' and you feel your confidence falling away from you, what you're probably doing is making some realisations. Seems like he's gaslighting you, if anything.

I know it's not good to take relationship advice from the Internet, but this just doesn't sound like a happy relationship to be in, whilst also being pushed to go through treatment for a new diagnosis uncomfortably quickly for you.

You need a stable and supportive partner to act as a rock through this difficult process where you try to find the right meds that work for you. It's not a cure, and it's not as easy as the first one you take is the first one that works well for you. This will take potentially months of hard work to find a stable mix of meds, sleep, exercise, etc. You need to do many things to help your ADHD, and he does not seem to be a good foundation to help you through all of that. He seems to want a quick fix instead, otherwise he's ready to 'jump ship,' and if he's ready to do it that easily, is he really that committed in the first place?

Really sorry, I know it's not my place, but my own experience tells me to air on the side of caution here."

Your partner must accept who you are without the medication because a bottle of pills isn't going to solve all the problems.

However, even though I'm now medicated, my partner still doesn't truly understand or accept my predicament and it's her perception and understanding that is the main problem. It will take time and talking therapy to get past this.

You don't mention if your partner has any unresolved trauma that he is dealing with. Consider that he may also have psychological problems and this is an influence on his unreasonable demands. Holding someone to ransom this way is at the very least a desperate last resort and possibly a manipulation, whether consciously sought or unsought (as a result of some disorder).

I did everything he asked of me, and it wasn't good enough. He also was cheating throughout the relationship (I was too naive to understand what was going on from being in a major depressive episode because of his constant criticism and then his avoidance of me).

Something that haunted me, which relates to this guy saying if something more stable AKA better suited to him came along he'd leave you,  my exes father once said ""this is exciting to him right now, but as soon as the next best thing comes he'll be onto that"" and it was extremely true.

Medication helps the symptoms, but not everything. The fact he would rather you be a zombie, than who you are tells me he wants someone who is quiet, looks pretty, and does what he wants. That's the beginning of controlling behavior, because you'll be tranq'd and subdued. He doesn't really seem to love you for you, dude. I know ADHD is annoying. I have had it my whole life and met people who can't stand me. My ex tried to change everything about me, then didn't like what he created. Head those words in this prior sentence. I became what he wanted and then HE DIDN'T LIKE WHAT HE CREATED. He didn't like me. Why be with someone who straight up said he'd leave when the next best  thing arrives? Why be with someone you know can't stand how you are to your core? To each their own, but think about it. 

The things he's said to you are horrible. Give it a few years and you'll be so inside your own head you will question everything you do, everything you say, and your self esteem will PLUMMET and you'll hate yourself when you look in the mirror. Woman to woman, with ADHD, don't do this to yourself. ADHD is hard enough, but to go to place of being unaccepting of yourself is harder. 

I'm not trying to tell you what to do, just trying to save you from what happened to me. People with ADHD need patient, understanding neurotypical partners with a sense of humor. This guy sounds the opposite of that.

Thoughts?","Your SO sounds only concerned about how your ADHD affects him.  A good partner would be concerned about how it affects you. Take medicine because it makes you feel better or don‚Äôt if you feel better without it. You are not a failure or problem, you are just you. You have to be happy with who you are first. If someone else doesn‚Äôt like it then they‚Äôre not a match for you. Find a partner who makes you a better version of you."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","Then you‚Äôre not everything they want. 

Meds don‚Äôt help everyone and they certainly aren‚Äôt a magic answer - some days I swear mine isn‚Äôt working at all. 

Move on, you know you need to get you life in order, that will be a continual goal and priority throughout your life. What you don‚Äôt need is a negative reminder of what you have yet to accomplish and ‚Äúwho‚Äù you aren‚Äôt in the eyes of someone claiming to love you unconditionally.

Allow yourself some time to recover. I‚Äôm not saying any of it‚Äôs easy, but you deserve so much better!"

Medication helps with some things, but you'll always be the same person. What happens when your meds start making you feel sluggish or anxious or any other numerous side effects and you decide you need to take a break. Is he going to accept that and understand your reasoning? Find someone who appreciates the person that you are. You deserve it, and we're out there."

My dad used to get annoyed at me and say ‚ÄúHave you taken your pill?‚Äù in the most scornful way when I was being flaky or silly as a kid. I told my wife this once after they (sweetly) queried whether or not I had taken that my meds that day. They, being a normal and compassionate person, were appalled when I told them the story about my dad. Now, they never mention my meds state, because they have empathy and realize that‚Äôs a trigger for me. _This is how relationships are supposed to work._

Meds will not fix your memory for detail. They will not make your partner more reasonable about chores, or more compassionate when you clarify your intentions. 

Your friends are right: these are abusive tactics. You are not overreacting. This is manipulative and toxic behavior. It will not stop when you get medicated. In fact, it will probably get worse. 

I‚Äôm so sorry. I hope you can find your way out of this relationship without too much heartbreak."

"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","Getting the right medication can be an important part of your health plan. Some people do a lot of other stuff to avoid meds. Some people are left s.o.l. because they can't tolerate any meds that have results for them. Meds aren't the end-all/be-all of ADHD care. 

Your partner is a hot sale on red flags. Living with an illness (any illness) is challenging for the well partner, but they should not be throwing down ultimatums or making threats to leave you. It's emotional manipulation. He's also being pretty unkind in general. If you were sick with a physical illness and he behaved likewise, it'd be easier for you to see just how screwed up it is that he is saying these things. Or imagine if someone was treating a friend that way, you wouldn't stand for it. If he wants to leave, he can, but he's not. He's being mean to you instead. 

So do get your ADHD under control as best as you can, and reducing life stresses like shitty boyfriends might help. You deserve to be treated better regardless of your brain status."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","Um. From what you‚Äôve written here nothing about what‚Äôs wrong with this relationship is your adhd, because everything wrong in your post is your partner‚Äôs behaviour. 

I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs just an inflexible asshole or if he‚Äôs intentionally being abusive and manipulative, and I‚Äôm not sure it really matters because either way the result is some absolute garbage, and you deserve to be with someone who treats you like a human being, not a problem. 

HAVING ADHD DOES NOT IN ANY WAY MAKE YOU LESS WORTHY OF A PARTNER WHO ACTUALLY LIKES AND RESPECTS YOU. And any partner who tries to convince you that it does is not someone worth your time or emotions, because they‚Äôre actually a garbage person. 

His escalating aggression, by the way, is 100% his responsibility to deal with. Not yours. And that behaviour on its own is a valid reason to rethink the relationship. He‚Äôs not just getting more aggressive, he‚Äôs got you convinced it‚Äôs somehow your fault. It really isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs his. 

As an aside, have you done meditation trials for your adhd meds? It‚Äôs possible the negative side effects you‚Äôve had might be the result of taking a medication that isn‚Äôt right for you, and they might improve on a different (type of) medication. If that‚Äôs something you want to pursue for your own sake. Really don‚Äôt do it for this human trash can."

Thoughts?","It's great that you're trying meds, but you should be doing that for yourself. Meds aren't going to magically make everything that bothers him go away completely. 

But the big thing here is, nothing you've described deserves the aggressive reaction he's having. Your behaviors might be, at worst, annoying, but he's overreacting by a large amount. Anyone who threatens an ultimatum to end a relationship over the behavior you've described is just trying to control you. Nothing you do will be good enough, and he'll just get more controlling. This is a one way ticket into Abuseville. 

The fact that he brought up leaving you for someone else unless you change, means he's already thought about leaving and has probably checked out of the relationship. He just set this ultimatum so he has an excuse to leave and not feel or look like the ""bad guy"" when he does. 

Do you really want to be with someone who can't accept you as you are, and makes you feel worse about yourself than you already do?"

You need to find a partner that‚Äôs very accepting and respectful (doesn‚Äôt mean they enable but that they support you to find solutions and be your best) or remain single.

"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","Dump him!!! Dump him dump him!!! He seems like such a meanie and a *royal* asshole. You're worth more than this!!! Find yourself somebody who gets it or who will at least *try*, I don't think I could spend my life with someone who didn't have ADHD, or a NT person at the least, so many of them are just pretentious! Here are some red ass mf flags that jumped out to me:

Right in the title: **""unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner""** \- Regardless of how your brain naturally works you're a grown adult! And you deserve to be treated as such! Here's the thing, often times our behavior gets labeled as childish because ADHD interferes naturally with the norms of capitalist society. Abiding by those norms is the basis of the adult world and so when we fail to meet those marks we can seem like we're failing adulthood. Also him setting conditions to take you seriously as an adult  is a dangerous slope.

**""Occasional inconveniences have turned into massive aggression triggers for him.""** The frustration of our loved ones is hard to hear and see sometimes because they're valid, and warranted sometimes too. But if he's not expressing his anger in a healthy way, get out of there.

""**..To him makes any argument of mine invalid**""; So toxic, just all around. He's weaponizing something you can't necessarily control, and it sounds like he's gaslighting you by saying your experience is incomplete thus invalid, and then accuses you of gaslighting?? But you're not actually making him question his reality, you're just stating your own?? The answer's right there.

**""I need to get medication or else he cannot be with me.""** That's a harsh ultimatim and is unfair to you, it places the burden completely on you instead of him doing research, asking ways he can support *you* as a loved one of *yours* too, being compassionate & taking steps to be/ learn how to be compassionate (i.e. therapy). If he's not adding anything to your life or supporting you in anyway, what's he doing? Being an asshole-y acquaintance? A negative energy? I get that nobody's responsible for another, but even friends help each other out and show a bit of grace.

**""If he meets someone else that is ‚Äúmore stable‚Äù he will go ahead ... rather than wait for me.""** He's not obligated to wait, but his attitude here is just telling. Does he love you out of convenience then?? Not waiting and actively supporting you?

**""He responded that he would probably like that more than \[current you\]""**\- That is absolutely a shitty thing to say, does not sound like love to me.

**""...willing to do anything for them to stay""**. Don't, that's such an unfair balance, signals some codependency, I don't even know where to begin here.

""What is the point?"" The point is you & that you deserve a healthy and happy life, no matter how long it takes you to get there. You're ""everything they want"", but are they everything *you* want?? Don't settle for shitty treatment from anybody, cut them out and focus on building you, *your* happiness. Get meds, not for some asshole, *but for you* and get your head above water."

Those things your partner doesn't like aren't going to change immediately. Medication doesn't fix your inclinations, personality and mood swings overnight."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","First of all, you should not feel pressured to do anything that you are not ready to do. Medication is a great tool but you need to go on that journey on your own terms if you choose to. 

Also, my closest friend has pretty bad inattentive ADHD. I am a very detailed and attentive person, I honestly remember pretty much everything. My biggest pet peeve is being interrupted or not being listened to. I always felt that listening and being attentive represents how much you care/love about someone, as to why I try to be very attentive in return. I will not deny that this was a big adjustment for me. 

I think your partner needs to try and change his perspective. I realized that just because someone is not as attentive as I am, doesn‚Äôt mean they do not care about you the same. Everyone has their own love languages, despite a medical condition. If I would have let this get the best of me, I would have missed out on the greatest friendship of my life. I can see he puts in a lot of effort and I appreciate it even more because I know how difficult it can be. I have gotten to the point where I enjoy being able to remind him of little things or remember where we were in a conversation when we get side tracked. He also does many things for me in return, it‚Äôs balanced.

I‚Äôm sure you have great qualities otherwise he would not have started a relationship with you in the first place. I am sure he has qualities about himself that could use improvement too. If he can‚Äôt be understanding and supportive about this, then he honestly doesn‚Äôt deserve to be a part of your journey. You need support right now, and I am sorry you have to go through this."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","There is no such thing as a reasonable ultimatum in a relationship. You're supposed to be partners, equals. By issuing an ultimatum to you he is placing you beneath him. If your ADHD puts a strain on your relationship (as is so often the case) then you need work through options and strategies TOGETHER as a TEAM. If you both think medication should be among those strategies then cool. But if someone says get medicated or they'll leave then show them the door even if you choose to get medicated on your own. You don't need that controlling bullshit in your life. 

You're friends are üíØ right his behavior is full of classic abusive patterns. I absolutely understand wanting to make the man you love happy and wanting him to stay, I stayed with abusers for far too long because I couldn't stand the thought of being without them but honestly, leaving was probably the best thing I did, both times.

You are not failing him and you are not failing your relationship. He's failing you and your relationship by being an abusive POS (like seriously I understand that you love him but what kind of a$$ says that if they met another girl who was more stable they'd leave).

Good luck on your medication, I hope it helps you manage your ADHD. And good luck on your love life, I hope you find happiness and true partnership"

A lot of the time manipulative or emotionally toxic/abusive folk will throw accusations on their partners to deflect that they're actually doing that. E.g. accusing a partner of cheating to distract from their own suspicious behaviour that could be an affair.

stimulant meds will not fix your adhd they might help, but it won't improve your memory much, it also won't change the way you like to do things, it might help staying engaged in long conversations but it won't work every time.

Ultimatums like these are pure exertion of power. They know you have a weakness, and they leverage it to gain control over you. At first, it‚Äôs ADHD; then they will come up with something else,  it will never end. 

I lived with a narcissistic partner for ten years, and I left two years ago, but I still haven‚Äôt recovered my sense of self and self-esteem. They always start small to test the boundaries. Then they push it a bit further and further and boom in five years you have to ask permission to go to a toilet.

I have felt very similar about my own adhd and relationships. But more so with toxic friendships. Not quite the same, but the same tactics applied. 

Making you feel guilt, or feel stupid. Constantly shaming you for any behaviours they are frustrated by. But then not hearing out your reasoning. Its selfish to not hear you out. I was not aware of my adhd until recently. My diagnosis helped me start working on boundaries and really understanding who has been good for me and who had to go. 

You should never be in a relationship with someone that does not at least take your emotions into consideration. In general patient and understanding people are the kindest.

Medication is your decision so long as you can function without it. I'm in a long term relationship and I do all of things you described. I'm not on medication. Sometimes it causes grievences with my partner, but it is never an ultimatum. I will be asked to do better next time and it will be left at that. He will work around me if needs be. And I know not everyone is suited to living with the ADHD brain (I'm not half of the timeüòÖ). But to say that they are willing to leave you at the drop of a hat? This person isn't for you.

It‚Äôs okay for ADHD, even untreated ADHD, to be a dealbreaker. But I worry about the way your partner is talking to you. If they would rather you feel bad (like a ‚Äúzombie‚Äù) for their own convenience than feel happy, that‚Äôs a problem. I also think that them threatening to leave immediately if they meet someone else is SUPER abusive language. 

I wouldn‚Äôt personally put up with someone that talks to me the way your partner talks to you. If they‚Äôre already that checked out of the relationship that they‚Äôre ready to pack their bags and leave, there likely isn‚Äôt anything left there for you.

Are my symptoms better? Yes, but I still forget random shit or still have to hardcore battle the executive dysfunction and that will likely never change.
You deserve better. You deserve someone who isn't going to hold a diagnosis over your head. ADHD isn't an excuse to not try on our side but it's also not an excuse to demand perfection from someone else.

I hope for your own well being rather they stick to their words or not, that you move on and get into a healthier situation..
All that kind of situation would do to me is cause severe anxiety and anxiety only makes ADHD symptoms worse.. They tend to go hand in hand.

This is unacceptable behaviour from your SO. 
While I don't believe an ultimatum like that is necessarily wrong, the fact you're in the process of getting meds means that you already agreed to get on them.
Regardless of this, being with someone who makes you feel lazy, stupid, or unappreciated is awful. I've been there. 
I know it isn't easy to leave a relationship, but good lord this relationship sounds so sad to be in. If he is saying he'd leave you for someone more viable, then he's basically saying he isn't committed to you. If you're looking for a long term serious relationship, this ain't it fam. 
ADHD isn't curable. You can manage with medication and therapy, but its never going to go away. Things like stress can exacerbate ADHD, making it worse. Basically if you're stressed out all the time, your symptoms will be worse. 
You gotta be with someone who can understand your behaviour, understand that you're trying your best to listen, focus, and remember. You need someone who doesn't add more stress to you. 

I don't usually like to be apart of the ""OP run!"" Crowd, since normally theres more to a relationship than what is being said in a small post, but from what you're saying, I really don't think this relationship is good. You're worth more than this.

The moment he said that if he found someone more stable that he would probably take that route, you should have told him to just go do that. If he truly cares then he would try to work with you on things. He would try to understand you versus medicate you. 

You are not a failure. You know how I know that?  You came to Reddit asking for advice. Failures don't ask for advice, they fail and then give up and move on.

This happens when you‚Äôre on the wrong meds. Since you were prescribed Wellbutrin, I‚Äôd be really cautious - that‚Äôs an antidepressant, not an adhd medication. 

There‚Äôs a ‚Äútrend‚Äù that I‚Äôve experienced myself in the states - a lot of doctors assume that it‚Äôs not ADHD and try to treat for depression and anxiety first, as they‚Äôre symptoms with a high comorbidity rate. I was prescribed Wellbutrin first, and then an anxiety med with it and oh my god I felt so shitty and unmotivated and just started just leaving work early, if I didn‚Äôt just call off instead, and it was a horrible experience. I actually quit taking the anxiety meds after about 4 days because I couldn‚Äôt do anything. It worsened whatever depression symptoms I had by just making me numb and nihilistic. 

This *could* be a rough month for you, especially since Wellbutrin needs to build up in your system a bit - and possibly isn‚Äôt the right medicine for you. 

And then I was prescribed adderall after those meds didn‚Äôt work and it *changed my life* - though it wore off quickly and I wound up moving to Vyvanse. I now feel like a better me - not different, no zombie feeling, I can just get shit done and focus. 

Yes, messing with your brain chemistry can be scary - it took until I was 29 before I decided to finally get tested because I was scared of this exact same situation. Just remember: if the medicines are having a negative or negligible effect, STOP TAKING THEM AND CALL YOUR DOCTOR. Don‚Äôt force yourself to take meds that make you feel like shit.

My point is OP, don't let someone tell you that they won't stay with you over anything you have no natural control over. Yes, meds might help, but what if they don't?

Edit: I just read it over again. The things he is complaining about won't even all be fixed by meds. I take meds, and trust me, you'll still have times you space out or forget what he said. The more I read it the more it sounds like manipulation, and the start of a really toxic relationship. He isn't worth it. 

Also, if you don't need meds for school / work / daily life things and are only going on meds for him. Don't. That's unnecessary! The purpose of meds are to make your life easier.

The sad part of my story is that I never had the courage to break up with him even though I knew how badly he treated me, because in my head, I loved him so much. I wanted to PROVE that he caused me so much pain for a reason, but you know what? Sometimes there's no reason.Sometimes someone we're in a relationship with has serious problems knowing how to live with differences, communicating non-aggressively, ALWAYS choosing to empathize with you in times of upset, because that's what a life partner does so you can balance cooperation.He should never show you how low you can go, but how high. This guy, right now, is probably someone you're not even friends with anymore. What you would be finishing doesn't exist anymore.

The feeling of relief, that you don't have to RESPOND TO ANYONE because you're making mistakes and being your authentic self, and yet still dealing with everything, is great. This I promise... is the best part"

Thoughts?",">I mentioned to him that I was scared of getting medication because it makes me feel like a ‚Äòzombie‚Äô sometimes. But he responded that he would probably like that more than me, currently. Is that shitty to say? 

I will not provide relationship advice, but after reading this, none of the other content mattered. If he was coming from a perspective of, ""I feel that despite some side effects, this medication would cause a net-benefit for you"" (in whatever specific way he might mean, like managing finances, general memory, idk whatever he could have said here.. **something** to indicate that it's for your benefit), then no its not shitty to say. One of my ticks was emotional eating and my wife said she's rather have a slightly more docile and less spontaneous me if the medicine meant that I could develop more constructive hoping mechanisms. My current means of dealing with my stress and anxiety was causing very negative consequences, but her concern was the betterment of my/our situation, not hers. There are new issues that she hates about the medicine, but we talk them out and we work out plans to address them as they come up (this a very new tactic we've developed, don't give us too much credit or anything lol).

Your SO is not saying that. He is not listening to your concerns and is only expressing what he wants, whether it being you meeting a standard that he expects of you or that a ""zombie"" you works better for him. We are talking about ADHD, so you probably are on the more ""twitchy"" (I use that term somewhat jokingly) side  than what he's used to, but from what you have shared he has no interest in the benefits medication would provide you, such as being able to compose your thoughts better or speak more slowly (I'm using examples of my own habits, YMMV). With the data you've provided, the conclusion is that he is exhibiting extremely selfish behavior without regard to your feelings and any negative consequences you might endure, real or perceived.

 You need to talk with your partner and tell him that your concerns are valid and that you two need to agree on what you two will do when he feels triggered going forward. How he can learn to react more calmly and how you can leverage this tool to meet him in the middle. Otherwise, no amount of treatment will create an adequate solution for the both of you."

Which to me is very discouraging because then .. what is the point?

The others are all flags that you're going to have an uphill battle to make this relationship work, but this one is the clincher for me. It's a clear sign he's emotionally moved on, and you're only going to be setting yourself up for some serious pain if you stay in it. You will never be good enough, and *it's not your fault*. It never will be your fault, but he will continue to blame you and whittle away at your self-esteem. You deserve better than that - and if you doubt that you do, realize that you only feel that way because you've been bullied into thinking so. It's abusive behavior. Everybody deserves to have their self-esteem left intact. No one has the ""right"" to destroy anyone else's.

In any long term relationship, especially if you have ADHD, you're going to have to do a lot of self-work and compromising to make it work. Only take that path with someone who is willing to show you acceptance and understanding, and do the same for you. I guarantee you that you will meet other people who make you feel good about just being yourself. You'll just click better with them, and complement each other better. I married someone who also has ADHD, but we were both diagnosed about 15 years after we met. We've have had some truly terrible soul-destroying times together, before being diagnosed, but also some amazing times as well. We've both had to overcome a lot of poor parenting and trauma, and we've both had times where we'd wished we'd never met, but what has kept us together every single time was that when push came to shove, when the offended stamped their foot enough, the offender grudgingly acknowledged their behavior was selfish, and made a genuine effort to change it. 

Generally, things have been getting better for us over time due to this, but things really started getting a lot better after meds. Our place is never really tidy, but it's not the permanent trashpile it once was. We cook more meals, do more regular house chores that help us both out and keep the rats away (although our cats bring in enough mice carcasses to make up for it anyway). Being able to do those things and also work full-time instead of 1-2 days per week have also reduced our stresses so we don't need to be at each other's throats any more. Meds give us a lot more room for love, and I would never go back to how it was before if I could help it.

You're not overreacting, trust your brain, trust your emotions. They are always on your side rather than anyone else's. Write them out onto paper if it helps clear some space to think. Relationships should be 50/50, if you're not getting what you want out of it, what he wants doesn't matter. Despite him saying that red-flag I quoted, if you still feel like you get a huge amount out of the relationship, then that's your decision to make. Be wary of esteem destroyers and shamers, though...they're going to mess you up by a factor of 10 if you have ADHD, because doing weird things is going to be natural to you...and even meds aren't perfect. 12 hours of stimulants means productive adulting-time while they're active, but when it runs out in the evening there's always a payback period of recovery, which can affect your ability to sustain a relationship with someone who doesn't bother trying to understand it."

Why do you feel like you're worth so little? Because he told you so? You're worth so much more and there will come someone along who will make you feel that.

So, my general advice is this: You can do better, he's using you because he's immature and really selfish, not to mention extremely manipulative.

* And you should only make the choice to go on meds when you desire it, a real partner should give you the space to listen to your inner desires and thoughts, and then comfort you and support you no matter what decision you make.

I'm so sorry you're going through this, I hope you find the partner who makes you feel like a princess and loves you for who you are no matter what. Big hugs to you, and remember to love your whole self in the meantime no matter what you're going through. :)"

I thought I was going to zombie out or ‚Äúnot be myself‚Äù too, however, my work and personal life have improved a lot since starting. 

As others have said, these meds are tools, not solutions. What some people don‚Äôt understand is all we‚Äôre doing is supplementing the chemical deficiencies in our brains and because the meds add those chemicals back in, it generally allows us to do better.

Pills won‚Äôt fix relationships though. While meds could potentially help your relationship at some level, I get really apprehensive when someone makes an ultimatum. Adding to that the threat that your significant other will leave you for someone more ‚Äústable‚Äù is extremely concerning to me. For me that would probably move me into breaking the relationship off if they were serious about that. If nothing else, make sure you‚Äôre doing this for you and not him. If this relationship doesn‚Äôt work out, don‚Äôt stop working on self improvement. This decision to seek out help and get meds should be for you at the end of the day, not him. 

Lastly- and this is most important- *you are not a failure*. Our brains are literally wired differently so it‚Äôs not a surprise that we don‚Äôt operate normally in a world designed for neurotypicals. It took me 37 years to figure that out because I wasn‚Äôt diagnosed until this year. I would hate for someone to feel that way as long as I did."

Thoughts?","Reading the title my initial reaction was ""GET THE MEDS!"" I'm in the middle of a separation where a big part of it was me getting diagnosed and on meds as she ran out of patience and tolerance with my inattention and reactivity without explanation. I was undiagnosed so we had no explanation for how I was behaving, no matter how many times I tried to change. As I'm moving on with my life and starting to get things in order it really does feel life if I'd been diagnosed and medicated 5-10 years ago I could have made things work, or at least made it clear that I can't instead of burning myself out trying to be neurotypical.

But then I read the rest of your post... Your ADHD is a part of you. You will never be without it. There will always be accommodations and differences that any loved one will need to make in order to be with you. To get an idea of what those are I recommend Melissa Orlov's book The ADHD Effect on Marriage. Even if you're not married it talks a lot about what both the ADHD and non-ADHD people go through in a relationship and can help build a lot of empathy for each other. If your partner reads that and isn't willing to build that empathy then I suspect that no matter how much you like them and are willing to do to be with them there's not likely to be a successful relationship in the long run.

**You deserve to be loved as a whole person including your ADHD, not in spite of it.**

That doesn't mean that you shouldn't medicate. Medication can make your life so much easier to manage, and that's important. By what you're saying though I'm not sure your partner will be able to develop empathy for your situation.

One thing that I've noticed in myself and in others I've spoken to is that people with ADHD get invalidated so much in our lives that someone who validates us can seem intoxicating. Even if that validation is intermittent and mixed with toxicity. It's better than we've ever received in life before and so it feels amazing. We can overlook the toxicity because everyone is somewhat toxic to us so that toxicity we get from our partner feels normal. Just because it's normal though doesn't mean that it's okay.

I wish you the best in your journey, and I hope that you have found someone you can be with. If not though, do yourself a huge favour and cut your losses no matter how hard it may be."

Thoughts?","First off, good for you trying to make the relationship work and trying to find solutions to your mental health. Regardless of the outcome trying to improve is a good thing. That‚Äôs something to be proud of. 

Looking at the relationship you‚Äôre describing. It sounds like your bf is escalated/upset and contemptuous about something, and he‚Äôs bringing it into the relationship. What is unclear, is whether he‚Äôs an abusive gaslighter, or just a damaged person who is struggling to be a good partner because of his own personal issues. That‚Äôs really hard to figure out on Reddit (and really hard to figure out in real life). 

My wife and I have been going through something similar the past 3 months. I started seeing a new doctor and changed medications; in hopes of feeling better and more focused. I started feeling great in the new meds, but she noticed I was irritable. That irritability was triggering for her. And I took her feelings as criticism against  my efforts to get better. For a while the problem was just feeding off of itself, and our relationship felt like yours sounds. We‚Äôve had a lot of hard discussions, fights and therapy sessions since then.

I would highly recommend a couples therapist to help navigate the hard feelings you are both having. Big lesson from our therapist was that you have to respect the other persons reality. He has to respect yours without the ultimatums, anger and fact-checking each argument. And not to overstep, but you‚Äôve got to respect and hear his (just guessing here but maybe) feeling isolated and unheard.  A therapist could also identify if this is a gaslighting situation or not. And give you support and information about your medicine options. (Personally, I‚Äôve also found that journaling my feelings between fights helps too. It‚Äôs easier to think on paper without an emotionally distraught loved one in your face). 

Hopefully, none of this is too off the mark. And if you need me to elaborate on anything let me know."

What will his reaction be when your meds wear off in the evening, or are not working, or you have to switch meds and wait for the new ones to titrate up?  This disorder is HARD on relationships.  You need a partner who is up for the challenges, the negotiations, the supportive compromises, the gentle accountability, the rueful humor about the situation.  This is not a relationship that can be negotiated successfully by a lightweight.  Obviously, the ADHD partner has huge responsibility for managing the disorder.  Medication is a commonly needed first step, but there will be routines to be established, workarounds for tasks that you are just not up to, agreements about divisions of responsibility, shifting strategies related to illness, job responsibilities, and just general life.  Do yourself a favor and stop asking yourself if you are too flawed to be with him.  Instead, evaluate whether he has what it takes to be with you.  It's not helpful for either of you to think that the impacts of this disorder are going to go away just because you get on medication.

Thoughts?","First off OP, you're not overreacting at all. If your brain is setting off alarms then it's definitely important to pay attention. 

I believe that medication, therapy, mental illnesses, etc in relationships is one of the most complex things to deal with/talk about. I had a partner who told me I needed to go to therapy or they wouldn't date me any more. If your partner is able to set a boundary with you respectfully then that's okay. But if they're pushing you to do something you're uncomfortable with, or even just making you feel negatively about the amount of time you're taking to get things done, and they aren't willing to listen to your feelings about the issue then you might have to rethink your involvement with that person. I know that's definitely easier said than done, but still.

You gotta sit with yourself and figure out if this is how you wanna be treated for the rest of your life, or if it's better leaving it alone, especially since you were open to taking meds in the first place.

"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","It‚Äôs reasonable for a partner to ask their SO to address mental health concerns via a professional. If the partner is aware of the issue and is refusing to get treatment in a timely manner and there is a large negative impact to the other partner, it can absolutely cause issues and lead to legitimate ‚Äúdeadline‚Äù requests. These are particularly pressing if the lack of treatment is resulting in their basic needs being compromised (such as never having your share of money for bills/rent/food) or if the lack of treatment has resulted in abuse of your partner. 

That said, there are some elements you‚Äôd expect to see from a reasonable partner making a request in order to maintain a healthy relationship. 

My bf and I realized I had untreated ADHD after about a year of living together. We both wanted me to get treatment, and me dealing with untreated mental health conditions was making us both miserable. Going through the process of treating the issues, realizing I would need medication, trying to make appointments that could result in medication, adjusting to meds, and all of the upkeep took forever and was super stressful, especially because the first part was done with untreated ADHD. If I had kept pushing it off, it would have resulted in a really unhealthy situation for both of us. 

My partner put in a lot of effort in this time to maintain a healthy relationship state for us and getting me the treatment I needed. They reminded and encouraged me to make appointments, helped with med side effects, came up with strategies to help me deal in the meantime, and would take care of small things that were hard for me (like remembering to pick up meds). 

We both put effort in to get me feeling better and treated. No ‚Äúget better by X date‚Äù or ‚Äúif treatment doesn‚Äôt do X I‚Äôm gone‚Äù. Obviously there‚Äôs only so much I can understand about your specific situation as an internet stranger, but hopefully this helps a little in trying to determine if the requests on their part are a request for a healthy, non-abusive relationship for you both or if they‚Äôre trying to use your mental health to manipulate you into an unhealthy relationship.

"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","So I was misdiagnosed with anxiety years ago (sike! ADHD!) and was given Ativan to cope. It made me feel like a zombie, and I stopped taking it pretty quickly because I did not want to feel that way. 

During an argument, my ex threw out a statement like, ‚ÄúYou need to take your pill now and stop being an asshole.‚Äù I shut that shit down right away, saying that I wasn‚Äôt prescribed pills to make my personality more bearable to him. He kept up this insistence that I needed to take my pills in order to make me tolerable, and it took me way too long to realize we were just a terrible fit. 

Personally, I think it‚Äôs a bad idea to be in a relationship with anyone who thinks **your** mental health prescriptions are **their** decision or for **their** benefit. It‚Äôs also absurd that your partner claims he will leave as soon as someone more fitting for him comes along. If he is that ready to end it, he should end it. Sounds like he‚Äôs more content controlling your actions than his own. 

If medication makes a person more volatile or causes other side effects that *truly* negatively impact on their partner, then that is different. For instance, plenty of birth control prescriptions cause hormonal imbalances that need to be corrected. My current partner helped me realize the arm implant was causing me to experience deep depression and suicidal ideation a while back, and he helped me communicate with my practitioner. The reactions of my two partners really stood in stark contrast to each other, and it helped me see how these two scenarios are different."

Insist if they don't know immediately what it is because it's heavily demonized by having gone through the drug approval process in like the 50s.

Thoughts?","Stimulant medication doesn't last all day, and they can interfere with sleep so you probably can't maintain a full dose in your body in the evening.\[1\]

If you have a regular 9-5 job, this means your meds will be effective when you're at work & maybe for part of the evening, but you're still going to be showing full ADHD symptoms in the mornings and late evenings.  If you are going to cohabitate with anyone, you'll want them to be ok with you as you are when your meds are at their weakest.

More generally:

If they're giving you this ultimatum because they don't want to date someone who won't make an effort to work on themselves, that's understandable.

Likewise, if you treat them poorly due to emotional dysregulation, it's understandable that they may want to ""see light at the end of the tunnel"" with regard to your behaviour, and they're (incorrectly) assuming the meds will fix this.  Meds can help you as you work on developing better coping mechanisms, but they won't fix anything on their own.

But if they're saying that they will leave you unless you eliminate your ADHD symptoms, that's just never going to happen.

I have ADHD - though that wasn't the main factor in the divorce. The main problem was that I was carrying the relationship 100% and she wouldn't do anything to work on our differences. I read a marriage book three times, offered to go to counseling, supported her, encouraged her, and was willing to bend in whatever way was necessary to help her achieve her dreams.

I realize now that was the wrong thing to do. If someone doesn't love you for who you are, it's not going to work out. They have to want more of what you got. Additionally, you need to have your own goals and aspirations in life. Don't let this person be the center of your life - figure out what you want to do and where you want to go. When someone comes along who digs you and your path (and you are infatuated with them as well), things will naturally feel better and you'll be glad to have left this guy in the dust.

He doesn't really care about you. He cares about himself. Leave and don't look back. It's going to be hard and  painful, but you'll get past it in time especially if you have family and friends to help you. Take some time to yourself to rediscover what you love about yourself."

I can no longer work and I barely function. After a lot of medication attempts, it is now officially labeled treatment-resistant. I'm always very tempted to give up.

 I'd say get out right away. You know this is wrong of someone to treat you like this, at least internally, and that's why you're writing this post.

This one thing could be good to help yourself, but it's for all the wrong reasons if it's because he told you to. It starts with this, small nudges that look positive but they're a dick about it, then over time they think they can nitpick everything and keep putting the relationship on the line like you're trash and they will just move on. Again, this isn't normal. This is a huge red flag. I got out of a 6 year relationship from someone that was like this. Its toxic as fuck, and you just don't see it in the beginning. They said they cared then over time got more and more toxic, as if small pieces of love was an award. The control will NEVER end and this a small sign of how it starts for everyone.

Take this positive thing and help yourself manage your adhd. But you know this guy just said this shit to you, he is a dick and just shown his true colors. It'll just get worse. Get out while you're still okay."

I have ADHD and I used to have a partner that did too, and it was very difficult at times. He would get very angry over changes in our plans, or inconveniences. He was impulsive in his movements which sometimes led to me being hurt on accident. He made impulsive decisions in our relationship.

It was hard to deal with, even if I could relate to him and understand his issues. I didn't want to live with someone who would accidentally grasped my wrist so tightly that it left a bruise for days, or someone who would get a meltdown if I went and pet a dog on our way to the store, or someone who impulsively broke up with me because he misread my tone.

I still wanted to be with him ofcourse, I'm not one to give up on people I love, but it put a big strain on our relationship and I was not willing to stay without seeing improvement in his behavior.

However, he had pretty much given up on improving his ADHD symptom and he had completely given up on meds after trying one type that didn't work. He wasn't willing to try any new medication, and he saw his situation as pretty much hopeless since he didn't have that ""miracle"" moment that some people have when they try  medication.

So since I didn't see any improvements or not enough for me to feel happy with him, I stopped fighting for us like I used to. I was in the process of getting a diagnosis, and I was gonna start trying out new medications, and seeing him having completely given up made me feel like I was the only one trying anymore. I never gave him an ultimatum, but if we hadn't broken up earlier, I would've.


That was my situation, and I don't feel like this type of ultimatum is wrong for everyone, but the way your partner is handling it is not good. You can never really hve ADHD completely under control, and it sounds like that's what he wants from you rather than improvements. The question you need to ask yourself is, how much are you willing to change yourself to fit into his world?"
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","My boyfriend was kinda like this when we first started dating- which was funny cuz he has ADHD too and at the time I didn‚Äôt know I had it (got diagnosed a few months ago). Took a few months but he got his head out of his ass and learned that me having a shit memory, short attention span, etc are not my fault and are not excuses or meant to be any ill will towards him.

People can KNOW that but still get upset when those things happen because emotions are unpredictable. It takes a WHILE and a LOT of patience to kind of retrain your brain but it‚Äôs not impossible. Now, he will rarely get upset over any of these issues, and it‚Äôs SO much milder than how he used to react. Your partner needs to realize and really understand you mean no ill will and you love him. 

Medication may help with attention span and forgetting things- but it will still be an issue, just slightly milder and he has to come to terms with that. If that‚Äôs a dealbreaker for him and he‚Äôs not willing to wait around for that, that‚Äôs his choice. He has the thought process of ‚ÄúI have to be patient until she‚Äôs cured,‚Äù which isn‚Äôt the case. Medication doesn‚Äôt cure anything, it just helps you get to a better place with yourself. 

Unless he‚Äôs willing to accept that, you‚Äôre incompatible and I‚Äôm really sorry, but it‚Äôs dead weight you can get rid of and trust me- you‚Äôll feel better eventually."

Danger danger danger.  This person is not an appropriate partner for any person they treat in the way you describe.  You picked them.. better start working on figuring out why and how not to next time.  

I hope the Wellbutrin helps although its not likely to have a pronounced effect for long, short term, any change will help.  Enantiomer ratio controled methylphenadate, time released dextro amphetamine or enantiomer ratio controled amphetamine, methyl amphetamine if you have no addictive tendencies and have never been addicted to anything (yes, you can get meth by prescription) are usually the most effective.  Watch out for generics on enantiomer ratio controlled medications, ratio is commonly off but if it's all you can afford it's better than nothing.  

I will forgo discussion of helpful supplements as I believe its forbidden here but such information is easily found at www.pubmed.gov

Good luck to you


Sounds like a mistaken partner, if this behavior does not change it will lead to trouble.  It's ADHD not schizophrenia or severe bipolar.  Or even worse substance use disorder"

If this person can't stand to be with you without meds they won't be able to do it with. End of story. Medication is not a magical unicorn that fixes everything. It can help greatly. BUT you are still you and you have a brain that works differently than normal. If he can't appreciate the good about that, he's not going to be able to get past the bad.

And tbh he's already told you he has one foot out the door. SMH I'm sorry this person has some issues they need to work on. It's not you. He's the A.H. Frankly he sounds like he told you, ""You're a place holder until I can find something better."" How selfish can you get? People with ADHD already have terrible self esteem. You shouldn't be getting abused like this from the person closest to you. 

Honestly sounds like he will be a manipulator. Any he's already giving you ultimatums instead of talking through the issue. And finding a solution that works for both of you. Go with your gut girl. You see the red flags, heed the warnings. üö©üö©üö©"

>I‚Äôm devastated because I feel like a failure.

This is so heartbreaking because I feel (and I bet most of us do too)  like this in genuinely every aspect of life, down to the most basic things, EXCEPT for in my relationship. When I look at how disgustingly happy I am now with a person who totally accepts me (and always has, even before I was diagnosed and all the ""problems"" were there just without a label) compared to my previous relationship, I have to pinch myself. I was in that one for way too long in some ways and people told me to leave long before I did, but it took me a long time to fully believe that I shouldn't be that level of unhappy, and a longer time still to fall out of love. 

Be kind to yourself. **You are not your adhd symptoms.** Everyone sucks at some stuff, ours just has a name - take meds to help you with the impact of your symptoms on your day to day life and for as long as they help you to manage the things you want to do. BUT PLEASE KNOW that if you're willing to sort out an emergency appt to get meds that you wouldn't otherwise take if he hadn't given you an ultimatum... And he's flat out told you he'll leave you if someone more stable comes along before you're ""fixed""? Whether he ""meant"" it or not, your love is wasted on this guy."

I suspect he also has ADHD but is undiagnosed. 

For example, If I need to vent about something he will always cut me off and talk about something else completely. But if I dare do it to him he would get really upset and aggressive. I have since realised that it is rejection sensitivity on his part. Once I slowly convinced him that I wasn‚Äôt being malicious and also wasn‚Äôt attacking him for pointing out that he talked over me all the time, then the aggression stopped. 

We had a few major arguments, but we did work though it. Our relationship isn‚Äôt perfect, but I am amazed how much he has changed over the years.

Unfortunately, if your guy isn‚Äôt willing to change, then he isn‚Äôt right for you. ADHD is hard to live with, but it is part of you. 

You shouldn‚Äôt ever be made to feel bad for who you are - and there is never an excuse for shouting/aggression, even if he is in a bad mood. He isn‚Äôt a child and can control himself - or he needs to see a physiatrist."

But something tells me that even if it were next week, that wouldn‚Äôt be soon enough. Or he‚Äôd find another reason to criticize you. 

I find it quite funny how some people will show their hands by accusing you of what they are doing to you. He is attempting to gaslight you by using your ADHD as a weapon to invalidate your position. 

That combined with blaming you for relationship problems (real and IMAGINED), shaming you for small things, for things beyond your control, things that everyone does, threatening to leave you, ARE abusive tactics and quite frankly red flags for narcissism. I have had these tactics employed against me in the past, it only escalates into further abuse. He has shown one is unwilling to work with you on this. Take his word for it. He is taking advantage of your eagerness to please him and manipulating you, but the thing is, no matter how hard you try or what you do, nothing you do will ever be good enough. I encourage you to look into narcissistic abuse, I would not be surprised if a lot of it resonated with you. 

Your ADHD is valid, your concerns are valid, YOU are valid. I am not articulating this very well right now due to my own brain fog, but reading your post set off ALL the alarm bells for me, and I have been through it.  I‚Äôve been where you are. I know what it feels like to be willing to do anything for them, they have a way of sinking their claws into you and making you feel like you‚Äôre nothing without them. Maybe you‚Äôre not there, yet, but he‚Äôll get you there if he can. 

I say this out of concern for your well being, but you should get out as soon as you can. The longer you stay the more he will manipulate you and cause you to doubt yourself and your judgement making it even harder to leave. He will likely find other ways to make you dependent on him as well. Make preparations to leave, the sooner the better. But do so quietly. Do not give him any hint you are leaving, he will deploy any tactic he can to get you to stay. When you leave, do so quietly. If you live with him, have everything set up beforehand, and move out while he‚Äôs gone. You may need help with this. Make sure you have mail forwarding set up ahead of time and that no mail that could indicate your plan is coming to the house. Once you‚Äôve left, block him on everything. Phone, socials, email, Venmo, your video game platform, everything. He will probably lose his shit and either barrage you with more abuse, or love bombing, or both.

Get medication.

Then let this relationship go.

Having relationship problems is normal.  Neuropypicals have relationship problems.

It‚Äôs normal for say, a partner to get a bit frustrated if you‚Äôre an amputee who can‚Äôt get the trash can in.  I mean, that just human frustration that we have to overcome and sometimes we lose perspective.  

But when words like ‚Äúyou are replaceable‚Äù are thrown around, that only serves to belittle and shift a power dynamic.  That‚Äôs unhealthy.  That‚Äôs not a good environment for anyone- regardless of a disability.  

Telling your partner you are frustrated and communicating feelings - even asking for some change - is real and good and part of the whole relationship thing.

But to get authoritarian and threaten to replace you is a hint that the relationship isn‚Äôt strong enough to overcome these normal everyday challenges.

Yes, get medication and learn how to be a little better of a person.  Always.  But NOT FOR YOUR PARTNER- for you.

Ultimatums like this are sick and transactional.  Relationships are not transactions.

You need a safe partner to be vulnerable and make mistakes around.  That‚Äôs extremely important.  They may get mad and frustrated,  (duh) but they don‚Äôt threaten to flush the relationship demanding that you change to serve them."

Completely and entirely unfair to ever go into a relationship expecting the other person to change.

Plus, every single person with ADHD that I know will occasionally take a few weeks or even months off of their medication. There's a million reasons why you may want to. And if you're not free to make that decision on your own because you're afraid that this person will leave you, then you may end up neglecting your own mental health just to keep them happy.

I promise you this behavior isn't going to stop after meds.

I encourage you to continue the route towards medication if that is what YOU want because it can help, but I also urge you to look up the wheel of power and control, kick his ass to the curb, and talk to a therapist that specializes in helping people who have experienced mental and emotional abuse, because that is what this is.

Please don't let him treat you like this. You deserve to be treated with respect. You deserve to be with a person who is willing to work and grow with you, not expect you to make all the changes.

You don't have to settle. Nobody should have to settle. Normally I'd say talk it out and let him know how you feel about the way he treats you, but in my opinion, what he did is past the point of no return, far far past that point. He doesn't take you, the real non medicated you. as a person worth taking seriously.

Don't take meds for somebody else. If you feel that you personally don't need/want them, you shouldnt. Don't bend over backwards for someone that won't do the same for you. 

Knowing that my gf had a piece of shit ex treat her similarly in the past just made me super pissed off reading this whole thing. Fuck your boyfriend, what a piece of shit."

the most important thing i want to emphasize: **NONE of this is your fault.** HE‚ÄôS the one who refuses to accept you for who you are, HE‚ÄôS the one who manipulated you into thinking you didn‚Äôt deserve better, HE‚ÄôS the asshole. don‚Äôt let him make you feel guilty about who you are. when your friends and family tell you that they care about you, adhd or no, listen."

All your symptoms you described are NORMAL for us, and honestly they happen even for neurotypicals! Like, you forget to finish a chore. It HAPPENS, and ew all deserve grace and compassion when those things do happen.

My wife clocked me as having ADHD before I'd ever even thought to get evaluated. We'd been dating for three years and living together for at least two when this became a serious discussion, and I only started stimulants earlier this year. Through it all, she's never used it against me. Ever. We laugh about the small stuff - I can never remember to replace the trash bag after i take the garbage out, for example - and we work together to solve the bigger problems. And the joys of ADHD get celebrated too - I'm the one that tends to come up with novel solutions to our problems around the house, on occasion I have very productive hyperfocuses and like, deep clean the stove or whatever, which helps. But ADHD or not, the point is that my partner and I love and trust each other and we rely on each other for things big and small. Your boyfriend does not value YOU and seems to think that YOU are what's holding the relationship back when it is clearly his own problems with you that are hurting you both. You deserve better than to be made to feel you're a burden to the one who is supposed to love you. You desrve better."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","That guy is overwhelmingly an asshole and manipulating you. 

That being said, as someone whos dad had ADHD, how he was was almost night and day when he took his meds. His relationship with my mom was much better, tension around the house was lighter, he eas more enjoyable to be around. Dont get me wrong, he was never abusive to us, but when he didnt take his meds or didnt have the insurance, his demeanor changed sharply, and my parents argued a lot more, and ultimately was a major driver in their divorce. I think it can be frustrating for someone who is NT to be with someone who they feel isnt taking the actions that make them a more pleasant and effective partner. I dont find that to be an unreasonable ultimatum. If I was with someone with, say, a constant open sore, and they refused to treat it, that would strain my relationship with them. 

I think you should absolutely get meds or do what will make you feel better FOR YOURSELF, but Id still dump this guy because hes bordering on or is emotionally manipulating you. Let you and your next partner reap the rewards of an improving you."

Everybody forgets chores occasionally or doesn't remember specific details especially if you're arguing. That's not exclusive to adhd and Meds won't change that. At least not completely. 
How often do you really forget to do you're share?

The other points are kind of personal preference. It can be a deal breaker if you can't have long conversations with your partner for some and other don't care. But that and the style in which you communicat are somethings you two could develop solutions together. 

What really worries me is that he doesn't care or would even prefer you when you're a ""medicated zombie"". He doesn't seem to consider your feelings to meds at all and that would be a total deal breaker for me. Your adhd, how you deal with and treat it is something between you and your psychiatrist.

If something is not working your partner is of course allowed to criticise you and give suggestions, but the way he demands for you to go on meds even though you don't want to is an absolute no-go. The fact that he sees them as the solution to everything and doesn't want to put any effort himself into fixing this with you just adds to it.
My alarms are going of too tbh."

Thoughts?","Not sure why everyone is coming down so hard on the spouse. I have ADHD, and my wife couldn't be any more opposite in how her brain functions. She is frugal, extremely pro-active, and has had the same routines since she was a teenager. These things all come natural to her, to the point where it seems almost effortless.  
  
All of these things are completely foreign to me. So, imagine trying to live with someone who.. Forgets to pay bills, mismanages money, is disorganized, prone to picking up new hobbies out of thin air, and has never had any sort of routine ever in life. That's a fuckin challenge and I don't think negatively on anyone that isn't willing to live alongside that rollercoaster.  
  
Thankfully, while I am quite opposite as her in many ways, I also have traits that seem to benefit her in the areas she struggles and (with medication and attention to managing my ADHD) we have worked through those early struggles and are quite happy.  
  
Good luck to you!"

However, the one thing that gets me is when he said if he finds someone more stable, he‚Äôll leave. That makes me think he isn‚Äôt invested in your relationship in the first place, if he‚Äôs casually looking for other options. My advice would be to leave him, not because your ADHD is frustrating for him (he shouldn‚Äôt make you feel really bad about it, but it is understandable for him to be frustrated), but because he sounds like he‚Äôs not committed."

I wish I had gotten my shit together years before I started to. I lost good people because I didn't really realize that the way that I was was impossible to be with in some ways.

For instance, being constantly late to stuff. It's a handicap sure but also it takes its toll on the people around you. 

If they break up with you are you suddenly going to do the thing everyone who gets heartbroken does and start improving after the fact? People always do this. They get loved and complacent. They stop going to the gym and put on 30 lbs. They stop communicating with their partner. They stop going out on fun adventures and just watch TV. They stop having sex. Whatever it is. Then all the sudden a breakup happens because their partner has begged and begged and waited and waited to see a change and none happened so they gave up. And suddenly because of the heartbreak all that effort is easy to make. Sometimes because you want them back. Sometimes because you realize they were right and you need to get those things under control to be a good partner to someone else. 

I think I would suggest that you consider if this person is worth more than your ADHD sparkle. Then start working on yourself.

**before I continue, I would like to say that I have first hand experience with what OP is going through, I have gone through it myself. More about that at the end**

It‚Äôs super romantic to think that love alone is enough to sustain a thriving relationship, but as we all know, that is not the case. 

Put yourself in his shoes. 
He works hard every day, he does his chores, performs well at work, maintains relationships with friends and family, all of the things that people do. 

He comes home from a long day at work and sees the kitchen is a mess, the bills haven‚Äôt been paid, the dog hasn‚Äôt been walked, whatever whatever. So NBD, he loves you so he just does it. Fast forward an hour, the kitchen is spotless, the dog walked, bills paid, everything is in order. 
The next day he comes home from work and again the kitchen is a mess, the dog has peed on the floor again, the works. How is he supposed to feel? How would you feel if every day you worked your ass off to meet your goals while the person you love is (unintentionally) undoing the hard work you put in? 

**How would you feel if you were dating yourself?**

**How long would it take for you to get tired of dealing with yourself?** 

Like it‚Äôs already exhausting for us to deal with ourselves, imagine having to hold an entire other human being together too! We know first hand how hard it can be for us to do literally anything, is it fair to want somebody else to hold our hand while we struggle at things that they could do in their sleep?

If you knew that your partner could take a pill and that would help him tremendously in almost every aspect of his life and In his relationship with you, would you ask him to do it? If you were the one who has felt like they have tried and tried, like they had been patient for longer than they knew was possible, who has fought to keep things going, how would you feel? 

I went through this at the start of the pandemic, my partner and I were stuck at home together day in and day out with no time apart to miss eachother. My ADHD was always something that held me back, but like many of us, I learned to cope a LONG time ago. But things were different. I couldn‚Äôt hide my shortcomings anymore, and neither could my partner. He was patient, he was kind, he was understanding. He was generous, he was helpful, he was supportive in every way possible. He is a high performing individual and as understanding as he was, he could not ignore the fact that I could hardly manage basic life responsibilities without constant support. I fucked up all of the time and he was always there to clean up after me, all while managing his own life. It was not easy for him or me. I felt like a burden. I WAS a burden. I never told him I had ADHD before, but one day we were both at the end of the line. No more patience, nothing left to give. But he wanted there to be more to give. He wanted to be with me. So I told him about my Dx and he asked me why I haven‚Äôt been on my meds. I told him it messes with my body and my personality, and even though it makes my life infinitely more manageable, I try to cope without it. He gave me the same ultimatum: meds or I‚Äôm gone because I can‚Äôt keep giving and giving and giving forever. He needed me to show him that I was willing to meet him halfway. I chose meds. Things have not been perfect, but they are infinitely better in every way. 

To me it speaks volumes that your bf has stayed and asked you to consider medication.
 **THAT MEANS HE WANTS TO KEEP TRYING!!!** 
If he didn‚Äôt care about you or the relationship he would have left already, you know he could have and you know he would have. 

The only question left is; 
**are you willing to do what it takes?** 
Are you willing to show him that you care enough to do something different? 

Good luck to you both, I hope it all works out ‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è"

My husband had a breakdown in a covid lockdown, seriously lost the plot.  We found out it was because of adhd and drop in dopamine levels.  His eyes were crazy.

Would you say 'If I find someone I like more than you I'm going to ditch you, by the way' to your friend?

If your brother called you, telling you that he's sorry for being late to your planned lunch together because he forgot to lock the front door and had to go back, would you shout down the phone at him, saying how he's so annoying and disorganised and that he causes so many problems all the time'?"

This isn't a horrible request, honestly it's a sincere one and if anything it's what should be said every time. Not taking care of yourself is never beneficial. The person is saying they will not deal with another who won't take care of themselves.

A classic I always see is ""be yourself, don't let someone dictate your life"" and all that BS...

Honestly, you're asking others who have zero stake in your relationship who are saying it isn't worth actually trying to better manage your ADHD. Medication literally does that. I'm a potato without meds. 

It's so common it's sickening and to the point of comical. The move on because you can't live your life exactly how you have been because someone else is actually trying to provide a better life for you... Bewilders me, it's shocking but now so common... It's like letting go of your self, gaining massive weight and being told that you're not attractive by your partner. Others will say to leave because they don't love you for who you're. Weight doesn't define you, you can literally change it with commitment and hard work, and actually giving a damn. This is the same thing. Regardless of the relationship you deserve to give yourself the opportunity of seeing how medication works. I'd be ecstatic to have a partner that wanted what was best for me and had the self respect to move on if I wouldn't make the changes I need to grow. Those against growth and development will always say you can do better and move on. 

No one's perfect, having someone that truly cares about you but won't stay and suffer in a relationship that goes nowhere is true compassion.

I'm a deeply caring person that wants others to be better, I've moved on from relationship because the person wasn't committed to development, growth, being better, taking care of themselves and being committed to no end.

Wouldnt you want to discover the best version of yourself? Make your decision off that. Don't let random online schmucks tell you to leave or do x when they are not impacted whatsoever

Hope your relationship is prosperous and your life is full of joy"

"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","DROP. HIM. My ex husband was very, very similar, ""you're just making excuses"", ""you're a mess"", "" you make things up"", "" you stress me out so much I deserve a side relationship to relive stress"" .... it's all bullshit and you deserve a partner that makes you feel secure. 
The things he has issues with are things that can be un-learned/corrected over time, like for example: the whole ""making things up because bad memory"" you mention- I've learned to start my stories out with ""ok I'm paraphrasing"" or ""So my memory's not great but from what I recall..."" , and my partner seems to be happier now that I've learned to start prefacing things 
But this dude- Giving you an ultimatum concerning your own health? Saying he'd be with someone else if you don't get better ? Nah. Fuck that. You sound way more into saving this relationship than he is. I'm sorry you're going through this, you absolutely do deserve better, and it's not with this guy."

Seems like he is determined not to see your good intentions and just wants to nitpick at your ""flaws"" of forgetting chores sometimes. You deserve something much nicer and someone who is ACTUALLY accepting. I'm so so so sorry this is happening, it sucks so bad. But remember youre NOT a fuck up, this doesn't mean u are not worthy of live and kind treatment. I think your friends are right.

"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","I'll be honest. If someone can't love you for who you are, they aren't going to love you for who you aren't. Medication doesn't last 24 hours, and there are days where you won't need to be medicated. Do you honestly think you can be happy with someone who doesn't love you unless your critically change something that is a part of who you are?"
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","I‚Äôm sorry- your partner said he would prefer a zombie version of you to current you?! That‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ wow.

I think the problem here is your SO has just decided meds are a panacea for ADHD‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs a useful tool for me- and for others, they function better without them. We‚Äôre not a monolith; usually it takes a multi-pronged approach (meds, therapy, exercise) to manage- NOT CURE- ADHD.

I would also like to point out it took me six months experimenting with four different meds to find what worked for me. Some had zero effect; Adderall fucked me up (always hungry but no appetite and sleeping was a struggle); 50 mg of Vyvanse has worked like a charm for me every day for 13 years. So as you‚Äôre finding what works for you (and trying to discern what‚Äôs real and what‚Äôs placebo effect), you may very well feel like exactly the same as you do unmedicated. Is he going to punish you for meds not magical turning you into his idealized zombie??

I don‚Äôt want to downplay how difficult it can be to be in relationship with someone with ADHD. It‚Äôs not something that ever goes away and god it‚Äôs exhausting to be me sometimes- and to feel like a constant disappointment and failure to my loved ones‚Ä¶ who are extremely supportive. I can‚Äôt imagine being with someone who says such hurtful things to me when I‚Äôm already mean enough to myself!

I ALSO know that posting about your relationship can be hard and reddit is very quick to jump to DUMP THE MOTHERFUCKER ALREADY! I‚Äôll just say this: proceed with caution. The red flag isn‚Äôt that he‚Äôs frustrated with you; it‚Äôs the fact that he‚Äôs being pushy, issuing you ultimatums that are heavy handed, and cares more about how HE‚ÄôLL feel about you medicated than how YOU‚ÄôLL feel. That‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ a smidge alarming.

Good luck to you! I hope meds help you - don‚Äôt be afraid to speak up if they‚Äôre not working! This is YOUR treatment so advocate for yourself as best you can. Hopefully you will only need to do that with your doctor and NOT your SO."

"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","OP, what you‚Äôre going through is abuse. At least, it sounds like it. My ex was very similar: everything was my fault. I was the reason the relationship was failing. He would nitpick all the chores that wouldn‚Äôt get done (even though he never lent a hand and his stuff cause a majority of the clutter). One day he was going to leave everyone behind and live by himself in the woods was something I heard often. It was my fault that he didn‚Äôt get a house when he was 21. Etc. etc. 

This is NOT acceptable. This is emotional abuse. He is tearing you down and making you his scapegoat. You will not have a good life with this man as he is. If you have things you need to work on he would be discussing it with you in a way that was constructive, empathetic, and non-accusatory. Instead he tells you he would love you better without a personality and he will leave you for someone else at the first opportunity. 

If you‚Äôre staying because you think he will change: don‚Äôt. He won‚Äôt change soon enough to avoid causing further damage to you.

If you‚Äôre staying because you think no one else will love you: you‚Äôre wrong. I thought the same thing and in months after we broke up I found the first person in the world who actually loves me for who I am and wants to work with me in finding ways for me to function better, and never puts me down for any reason. 

You deserve better. I cannot stress enough that you deserve better. You aren‚Äôt broken. You aren‚Äôt wrong. You aren‚Äôt unworthy of being loved. You don‚Äôt need a personality rewrite in order for you to be treated with love and respect. You don‚Äôt deserve what this person is doing to you. 

I‚Äôm sorry if I‚Äôm getting overly emotional, but I have been in your shoes. It got so bad my hair started greying when I was 21. Don‚Äôt let this person continue to mistreat you. Get a therapist and be honest with them about what‚Äôs going on at home. Get yourself away from him and in an environment that will help you grow.

Edit: OP, please message me if you ever need to talk about this. I may not respond right away because I don‚Äôt check Reddit every day, but I promise you I will be judgement free and empathetic to your situation. Please be safe and take care of your emotional and mental health."

You deserve a partner who loves you for you, and who is willing to help you when you're struggling, not shame and blame.

Medication will very likely help you, and I recommend trying it out, but it should be your choice. If you've never been medicated before, this is going to be a process. It will take time to figure out which meds work best for you, and what your ideal dose is. Medication is just a tool to help you, but it's not going to ""fix"" you in the way they seems to want. In fact, you don't need fixing, you need support and compassion. You need someone who will laugh with you when you make silly mistakes, and gently remind you when you forget things.

If you want children, you should think long and hard about what kind of parent this person will be to an ADHD child; it is hereditary after all...

Good luck OP, I wish you all the best!"

You will still have ADHD, you‚Äôll always have ADHD, and there are times when you won‚Äôt have a med or they won‚Äôt work that day and things will be exactly the same as they are now. In fact there will be days where your ADHD is even harder to manage, and on those days you need a supportive partner who not only understands & accepts but LOVES your adhd for all the ways it makes you creative, intelligent and unique. 

These issues won‚Äôt go away with a simple medication change. IMO he doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs working, and is using this as an excuse. Don‚Äôt buy into it. Your body, your choices, the medical system is always going to be a slow shit show and ADHD will always make you forget things so you need to start asking yourself where HE fits into all this.

Trust me. The right person will love you through and in spite of your flaws and setbacks. They will love you for you. Of course growth is always possible but it should be done lovingly and slowly with encouragement and support not hatred and harsh words. 
I am so sorry you are going through this. 
All I can tell you is to end this relationship and wait for the right person for you to come along. 
Get help if you need it. Or learn to work with your adhd naturally, if medication makes you feel like your not yourself.  
You are so important and valid! Do not let a measly man take your self worth away from you.

I can fully accept that he's at the end of his rope - not everyone can be with someone who has ADHD. I get that we're a challenge and maybe this was a switch in his personality instead of how he was before you, but if he's unhappy enough to manipulate you, emotionally blackmail you, control you by demanding that you see to YOUR health issue by HIS methods, he's allowed his hurt and resentment to turn him into your abuser.

If this relationship started out healthy but has devolved into this abuse, leave him. You two aren't compatible. He needs to work through his issues, and there are other people in the world more equipped to love someone with your particular struggles. If this relationship has always been this hurtful and unhappy, leave him. He's abusive, and you deserve someone who doesn't insult you, control you, manipulate you, or accuse you of being manipulative simply because your brain is different than his. Keep working on your ADHD symptoms and find someone who won't hold them against you as though they make you a bad person or an unlovable person.

"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","NO you are not overreacting. This is emotionally abusive/ a precursor to abusive behavior. 

My partner and I both have adhd and both do things related to it that rub each other the wrong way. For example, I used to get riled up and upset about his messiness. I have had passive aggressive behaviors or said hurtful things because of my impulsivity. However we discuss these things and I apologize if I've hurt him, because he doesn't deserve that. For example-I explain ""I got upset about the cleanliness of the house because I am working really hard to keep things clean and it feels disrespectful when you are messy. However it was not ok for me to speak to you like that and I'm sorry. I should not have said that."" He accepts this apology and part of it is that I don't continue to make the same rude statements over and over.
I truly hold what he has said close to my heart and in the future work on just saying "" I am upset about the state of the kitchen, can we address it?"" Instead of a personal attack. And he LISTENS. He has also been working hard at getting more organized and I notice and appreciate it. I am working on being kinder with my words and speaking up frankly but not in a blame way when I am upset. This only works because it is a two way street. We both have made changes regarding the thing that upsets the other. And neither of us are perfect at it, but both have improved and we can see that we are both trying.

I was once in a relationship with someone with more severe depression and mental health issues. I loved him so much, but really did feel I couldn't go on in the relationship because I was trying to fix his problems and he was just not trying to get help. I did not hold this over him, but I did let him know I was getting exhausted. I eventually broke up with him because of this and it was really difficult. It is abusive to keep telling someone they are inadequate and make empty threats of leaving. Had he actively been trying to get help, as you are (!!!), things may have been different. 
We must recognize our partners efforts to TRY at improvement. If we need more than they can give, we have to accept this and end things without blame and abuse. It is not fair to constantly guilt someone who is already having a rough time.

He kind of sounds like a manipulative shit."

It would be no different than having any other medical issue that you simply ignore or procrastinate about (wait, ADHD people procrastinate?)

I put my NT wife through hell sometimes, but I couldn't imagine her ever threatening to leave or even worse, threatening to leave me for someone ""more stable."" We made a commitment to each other, with all of our flaws on the table, and said our love is strong enough to weather the bad times. 

While I do think you need to make sure to take care of yourself, you need to do that for YOU. Not someone who thinks your world should revolve around them. After 30+ years of dealing with untreated ADHD, I'm finally starting to manage it better and even take advantage of it sometimes.

My partner and I came to a point where he said I needed to seek help or it was over because we couldn‚Äôt live how we were. He didn‚Äôt ask me to speed it up. That was Aug 2020, got meds and a referral that month and wasn‚Äôt diagnosed until December. I‚Äôve been playing with meds this whole year. June I was on adderall and it was the WORST, I was the worst. He still loves me and stays with me because I‚Äôm trying and we‚Äôre working on things together. Just getting medicated isn‚Äôt going to fix your relationship. The fact he‚Äôs said he will find someone else if you‚Äôre not quick enough is absolutely vile and you should leave. The alarms are SCREAMING!! Get out. He will leave as soon as he finds someone else he deems better no matter if you get help or not because he doesn‚Äôt respect you"

It almost seems like he‚Äôs ‚Äúover‚Äù the relationship esp if he‚Äôs being this mean spirited on a regular basis.  If u want to take meds to be more productive/fill-in-the-blank then so be it but it seems like there‚Äôs more to it for him.

I‚Äôm sorry but-everyone has issues and if he can‚Äôt get his head around the fact u are, in fact, absent-minded then he and u have to make a choice whether or not to stay together."

I'm sure you, like all humans with or without ADHD, have stuff you need to work on but you should do it for you cuz at the end of the day you're the one you have to live with. Your partner sounds manipulative he's using some legitimate complaints to overstep his bounds and control how you act and feel. I'm not a fan of his but I've been in bad relationships so I know it's not always easy to leave. I wish you luck with the relationship and the new meds."

Yes, it‚Äôs terrible to say he‚Äôd rather have an emotional zombie than you.  It‚Äôs terrible to threaten to leave if you don‚Äôt get on meds.  It‚Äôs terrible to say he‚Äôs already looking for someone else.

I‚Äôm going to assume that at least some of the description is hyperbole, things said while upset.  But the two of you need to have a serious conversation about what you want in the future, because it‚Äôs sounding pretty bad from a relationship standpoint."

I would understand your partner expecting you to develop coping skills to maintain responsibilities and regulate your emotions but your inability to remember and your natural method of communicating aren't things that he can reasonably ask you to change. 

If your motivations have been explained to him...it's on him for not believing you and choosing to misunderstand at this point. I'm not saying that communication can't be improved, but it takes two and he's refusing to meet you halfway and take the things you say in good faith.

Also, a partner who tells you that they're going to bail as soon as they see someone better isn't a partner. You should believe him when he tells you this. I'll let you come to your own conclusions."

Sometimes he has made me so upset by forgetting chores or whatever, but in the end i wouldn't prefer a different partner. I like him for who he is and if it means just having to deal with a messy house and getting upset about it once in a while, I'll take it. You guys sound completely incompatible and the things he is telling you are horrible. You deserve to feel good enough, because you are. If you're really trying your best to manage your symptoms, and he isn't having it, it's his problem. 

It doesn't even matter if what he's feeling is valid if he is telling you he will abandon you for someone else the moment he gets the chance, wether he means that or not. That crosses a line."

Maybe he will learn to love and understand that part of you. Idk though.

I do recommend you get on meds and figure out how to use the state of mind as a tool to be the best you, do you.  Being comfortable with yourself gives you breathing room to think more objectively about your relationships imo"

Genuine question - why are you settling for someone who treats you with so little respect and makes you feel so bad? I suggest writing the answer down and reading it carefully. Then see if you‚Äôd accept that answer from someone you love in your situation. You deserve much more.

If they want to leave you for that let them. You deserve more than this stigmatizing controlling ultimatum setting meanie butt. Even if u do love them. That's a medical decision that's between you and your docs, not them. Plus, what if medication didn't even work for you? Huh? What tf would they do then? 

I have ADHD and my partner is so helpful and just works with me the way I am. I'm sure I annoy them by being late and stuff sometimes but they'd never ask my to make a big medical decision for their convenience. 

Ugh. Good luck OP. You're partner is way out of bounds."

We broke up. Fast forward I met my now husband who pre diagnosis also noticed these things about me but he wasn‚Äôt mean and more importantly he was patient with me. All that to say I‚Äôm now medicated and the stuff that annoys him still exists just maybe on lesser scale and my husband is still as patient as he ever was. You deserve kindness, you deserve patience and most importantly you deserve to be with someone who accepts you as you are medicated or not. I truly hope you find it."

It is very hard to have an ADHD partner, but when you love someone you can get to accept the ADHD. I'm sorry that your partner is so abusive, I'd say is already too much to deal with the ADHD itself, to add on top of that the worry of not being functional enough for someone else. A partner should be helpful, not stressful. You deserve to be loved, acknowledged, and validated. Good luck!"

This isn‚Äôt a secure and supportive partner. They need some serious education and you guys may want to consider joint therapy but I wouldn‚Äôt continue as-is without trying to address that. You‚Äôre setting yourself up for failure and insecurity.
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","I've low key been in this situation and let me tell, it's probably only going to get worse even on meds.

It kind of sounds like he almost doesn't believe the struggles you have, almost like he thinks you're doing it on purpose.

My ex would constantly be upset at little things like this and wouldn't understand why I acted how I did sometimes. Then, I once remembered some odd obscure thing she told me, and she acted so shook and confused. ""Oh wow, you do have weird memory. Why did you remember x and not y though?"" and that's when it hit me, she doesn't realize I'm serious about quite a few of my struggles and probably thinks I could just ""try harder.""

I feel like you're in a similar situation. These ""little things"", even on meds quite a few of them are still going to be the day to day core of you, and by extension, something you're partner will probably be more and more irritated by over time.


In short, it's ur own body and ur own brain dude. If you take meds, do it for yourself and improvement of your life first. Yer Boi might leave but you'll always have to take care of yourself."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","From my perspective they are being very overbearing and controlling.  I can absolutely understand how little things in a relationship over the years can become more irritating as time goes on.  But how you fix that is communication and working together to figure out the best way to get it to work for you both. Not laying down an ultimatum like you have control over it, I have gone on and off meds and I don‚Äôt think it will fix everything because meds are not just a magic cure all for ADHD.  

Also if they are willing to put that kind of ultimatum down and then stack on top of it if I can find someone ‚Äúmore stable‚Äù before you fix yourself I‚Äôm gone clearly shows they do not love you as much as you love them, if they did they would be willing to work with you to help you become more stable not just quit and run as soon as they think they found something better.

Imo I would slowly start getting things ready for a breakup and then when the time is right give them the big ol‚Äôboot, and cya never ending cause they are not the kind person."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","I am so sorry. This is terrible and I believe you should just leave that partner. They do not care about you as much as they say they do. If they did, they'd encourage you and research ADHD to find ways to help support you. 

I am a partner who's spouse has ADHD. And I could never see myself do what your partner did. As soon as my spouse displayed symptoms: we both did research and started the journey. It's been a tough process. Ideally it was quick for him to get his diagnosis but the doctor we had was a quack. So it's been hard. There are days where we both are so frustrated with each other. But then we remember why we are committed to one another. So I found my spouse a new doctor and we saw that doctor last month and in that time: we got the diagnosis, and the start of a treatment plan. My partner had an abnormal heart scan so we have to have them wear a halter monitor and hopefully soon  we get the green light to start stimulants. We got all this done in a month when it took 4 months with our previous doctor. 

My point of sharing my story is to let you know that your partner is in the wrong to give you such an ultimatum like this. They should love all of you. They should be supportive of you. And encouraging you to find treatment not shaming you for it. 

I wish you all the luck on your journey."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","To be honest, i don't know, but there will probably come a time in the future where even if the meds work well and help you, quitting them often is a logical step for 90% of sufferers after having recurved good help from meds and a psychiatrist, or meds don't work sufficiently or side-effects are unbearable, that you probably won't be on them forever, I mean if someone got that hard up in my business I'd be pretty pissed, being medicated is a personal choice and it's up to each individual to weigh it's pro's vs it's con's, and for someone to try and dictate that would make me rather angry.

I'm don't want you to think I'm some master at life so take my advice with a pinch of salt that's just how I'd feel about it and I might be wrong tho."

"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","Listen to the alarms. IMHO that is not that of a trained therapist this guy sounds like he may be a narcissist, or has strong tendencies in that direction. People with ADHD are prime candiates for abusive relationships because attention from your person gives all the dopamine. You dont do what they want, they take it away.

I can understand them being frustrated with you, but ""If I find someone else who I like that is more stable"" is a trap and if you take the bait and tolerate that with your ADHD and medication they will use it to manipulate you for anything.

The fact that it seems like there isnt a single thing you can do right and doesnt have any compassion for what you are dealing with as far as what your brain is doing I would say is a failing grade for the relationship.

Listen to your friends, dont wait for it to get worse and reaching your breaking point before leaving. Find a human who wants to be your partner and empowers you with your condition, not hold it against you."

My honest opinion? 
He‚Äôs a cowardly, abusive asshole. He wants a version of you that isn‚Äôt you - he is asking for the impossible. To blame all these things on ADHD is INSANE. While some of the stuff can be frustrating to our loved ones who don‚Äôt have to live in our heads, what he‚Äôs saying to you is inexcusable and cruel.

Your friends are correct. These are not only abuse tactics, I‚Äôd go so far as to call the relationship itself abusive. Especially that last little tidbit about it he ‚Äúmeets someone more stable‚Äù he will just, what, cheat on you? Leave you for someone who he barely knows but believes to be mOrE sTaBlE? Sounds like he‚Äôs just setting it up for him to engage in increasingly shitty behaviors and have it be somehow your fault.

Dude‚Ä¶fuck him. I know it‚Äôs definitely not nearly as easy as ‚Äújust leave‚Äù but I think you need to go talk to your trusted friends today and really start making an exit plan because you do not deserve this."

We are only getting your perspective on the situation, but if it is as close to the truth as possible, then you need to consider dropping him. YOU ARE NOT A FAILURE. Everyone has their cross to bear in life. ADHD is yours like many of us. Your value is not based on how your brain is wired. You need to believe that and your partner should be affirming that, not negating it. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on in his personal life or your personal life or your lives together, but you have to be your biggest supporter right now.  If this is out of character for him, then maybe figure out what‚Äôs going on. But if it has been a persistent issue for long enough then you must take care of yourself.

He made an unreasonable ultimatum and he doesn‚Äôt want to be with you through the medication struggles and challenges (cause not everything works the first dose or type of medicine). 

Better to let him go now than to discover he is leaving you for a more ‚Äústable‚Äù person. 

Also. You are stable. Your brain works differently. That doesn‚Äôt make you unstable, unworthy of love and acceptance, and your ability to see that your current issues would be much better with compassion and communication means you understand that life doesn‚Äôt have one quick fix, but instead is a process of give and take. 

I would move on."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","Lots of red flags here. Please run. 

It seems like you already know this, but it *is* important to be mindful of how ADHD affects relationships. It can be hard for us to do things like listening and cleaning that a balanced relationship needs. A good partner will communicate this to you with empathy and not by insulting you or threatening to leave. I feel some responsibility to manage my symptoms as well as I possibly can for my partner's sake. For me that includes medication, but what that looks like for you is nobody's decision but your own."

I can‚Äôt say for certain, but this guy sounds manipulative, unsympathetic to your problems, angry, and kinda abusive. Frankly, I find ultimatums in general to be fucked up and borderline abusive.

Like on the gaslighting thing??? You‚Äôre the one being gaslit here.

"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","I‚Äôm not going to tell you whether or not you should leave your partner, because I don‚Äôt know the specific dynamics of your relationship. It‚Äôs also generally a moot point, because *you* have to be the one to make the decision. The choice has to come from within you. What I *will* do is share my own experience.

I was with a long term partner a few years ago, and I thought I wanted to spend my life with him. I lacked dating experience and I wasn‚Äôt aware at the time that some of the behaviors and dynamics of the relationship weren‚Äôt healthy. I was willing to do anything to make him happy. That said, I was suffering a lot from anxiety and depression that I had been treating for years with limited progress. The only condition I had yet to be medicated for was my ADHD, and I was certain that it was the root of my other mental health issues. Doctors had denied me treatment for years, but I finally managed to find a psychiatrist who agreed to medicate me. I was over the moon.

I told my boyfriend and he immediately reprimanded me. He believed that mental issues were a sign of weakness/laziness. He said that by taking stimulants I was doing ‚Äúlegal cocaine‚Äù and insinuated that I should stop. Never mind that I had actually seen him do ILLEGAL cocaine‚Ä¶ anyway‚Ä¶

I discontinued my treatment. My mental health suffered and our relationship only got worse from there. Eventually the relationship ended because I couldn‚Äôt handle the controlling behavior, gaslighting and abuse from him. It took me three years before I was able to find a psychiatrist willing to medicate me again, and in that time I suffered a lot from ADHD interfering in my day-to-day life. It makes me angry that he influenced what should have been MY choice.

Ask yourself a few questions:

- Is being medicated what you want?

- Would he do it if the roles were reversed?

- What advice would you give a friend if they came to you with this predicament?"
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","I mean if you are trying and that is not good enough let them go. If they can't handle you at your worst they do not deserve you at your best. Meds aren't a cure all and sometimes you have to try different things at different dosages it takes time. If it makes you feel like a zombie you need to talk to med provider about that cause it typically means they need to make adjustments or it could be an adjustment period. My borderline meds kicked my ass when I first started taking them but the doc reassured me if I take them consistently my body would adjust. Idk how it works for ADHD meds aside from what I know from research cause I have had difficulty getting on them so no personal experience, but meds are not bad at all if you can find the right fit and dosage. If you have been through it all some people just don't have much luck with meds, and you could try CBT.

But like, idk spouse sounds like a dick. If they can specify what specifically it is about your ADHD you could try to find some coping methods and make compromise, but idk. Sometimes it's best to just move on. They don't sound like they are worth that effort. 

Someone who won't be supportive of a mental disorder sounds like a shitty partner though. So like others have said my best advice is just dump em. You would probably be better off without them in the long run."

Medication does not cure ADHD.  ADHD is at its best managed, through a combination of meds and therapy.  A partner that does not understand this or will not support you in this process is going to make your ADHD that much harder to manage.  

That being said...

>Recently, he‚Äôs also mentioned to me that if he meets someone else that is ‚Äúmore stable‚Äù he will go ahead and take that route rather than wait for me. 

Seriously fuck this guy.  Be willing to do anything for YOURSELF, not someone who straight up told you they'd replace you for the sake of personal convenience.  I won't pretend to know everything about your relationship, but between that and straight up saying he'd like you more as a zombie than 'how you are' is incredibly fucked up.  Your friends aren't wrong, he is demonstrating some clearly abusive behavior.

I do this too, it's like reading out the error log to trace the logic and point of failure more than anything else.  ""Making excuses"" is what I'd expect to hear from a parent or a teacher, not from my partner.

Seriously, this sounds very much like somebody using your neurodiversity to diminish you as a person. We ADHDers have enough self-doubt and negative self-talk to contend with, without looming threats of abandonment if we don't suddenly become neurotypical (spoiler: we won't). As others have said, meds are not a cure, but a tool to help us manage. You will always be you, and you will (to a greater or lesser degree) always have ADHD. You need, and deserve, a partner who understands, appreciates, and supports you on the quirks and eccentricities that come with that. ADHD is both a blessing and a curse - our support network and state of mind has a huge influence on which side of the scales it tips. 

From what you've described, both of you - but ESPECIALLY you - deserve better."

You can treat all you want but I doesn‚Äôt magically remove your ADHD. What happens when symptoms are reduced? Will he still be a pill when a symptom shows or will your treatment truly be enough for them to be more patient and understanding - less attached to expecting you to be NT?

Like the ‚Äúif something better shows up‚Äù language is a big old red flag. Is this person worth fighting for right now or do you deserve that energy? Wishing you luck.

Also, as others have said - meds aren't a fix. They help, but they don't cure this and they certainly don't tend to make it where we actually function like people without ADHD when on them. They just help us manage some of it.

I know it hurts, but I'd recommend getting out of this relationship and finding someone who likes you for who you are and not some weird idea of what they think you could/should be.

I do not think that your feelings of anger, shame, annoyance, or upset are unreasonable.  

What you've described is someone who has been given ALL the necessary information to become empathic and compassionate with you, which is a reasonable expectation from your ROMANTIC PARTNER. Instead, they choose to belittle you and blame you personally for things that you've clearly communicated are a challenge to you. ADHD or not, if you tell your partner that you're finding something challenging and might need help in one area, it isn't reasonable for them to instead berate you for not being good enough. 


There are several very different questions here: one is about whether you will function better on medication.  That's between you and a doctor.  Maybe a trusted loved one but only maybe, and that's your call. 
 There's the question of whether you are being treated fairly and well by your partner based on the description you've given. To me it sounds like you are not, and have not been treated well.  There is a question of whether your partner has the right to ask you to get medicated, and i think they do... but they're also going to have to accept if that's a problem for you.  And finally, there's the question of whether your partner is reasonable to give you an ultimatum and threaten that he'll leave you if 'something better' comes along.  And the very blunt answer to that? You shouldn't stay with them.  That's a horrible thing to say and is borderline abusive.  It's effectively making it OK to cheat on you in their eyes, but then blaming you for it. That's absolute nonsense, and you really shouldn't tolerate that.  I hope you leave them, because that's just horrible. 

Good luck and if you do get medication, I really hope that it makes you feel more in control and comfortable in your own skin. If it works for you, awesome! But your partner sounds like, pardon my french....le douchenozzle."

He accepts my quirks and helps me work through them, like making me breakfast every day so I can take my Adderall. He just prefers to live in a house where you can see the floor and the animals eat on some kind of schedule and there aren't half finished projects everywhere. 

It's okay to have a personal preference that your partner be appropriately managing their condition. My husband is bipolar, and a condition of our relationship is that he be in treatment, because bad shit happens when he isn't. There are frustrating things about being in a relationship with somebody who has a condition and doesn't treat or manage it. But there are other red flags here with his treatment towards you.

I would also say that if meds make you feel like a zombie, it's possible that you haven't found the right one. I can't stand concerta, Ritalin, or Vyvanse, but Adderall makes my brain click into place.

This pattern, of first being accepting of your condition, then getting upset at the symptoms, then threatening to leave you for someone else, etc. it turns into a progressively more abusive cycle. 

My partner gets frustrated when I forget to do a task. All he does is say ""Hey I'm taking care of it now, but can you write a note to yourself or something to remember to do X?"" He doesn't threaten to leave me. He doesn't tell me to up my dose. He respects my bodily autonomy while making reasonable requests. That is what a healthy relationship looks like.

>I mentioned to him that I was scared of getting medication because it makes me feel like a ‚Äòzombie‚Äô sometimes. But he responded that he would probably like that more than me, currently. Is that shitty to say?

YES! That is absolutely shitty to say. He doesn't care about your feelings, only about how you affect him. He's selfish and mean about it. This is unacceptable behavior from a partner, regardless of the situation. 

>Am I being taken advantage of? Because I AMwilling to do anything for them to stay

Why would you want this monster in your life? He doesn't care about your feelings and doesn't care if you're happy. I'm sure you've left out most of the positive things about your relationship, but I honestly cannot imagine any positive that would outweigh your partner telling you to your face that they'll like you better if you are a zombie and they don't care that your scared of your meds or that they'll probably just leave if someone ""better"" comes along.

I'm so sorry that he's treating you this way. It's heartbreaking when the people that we think care about us turn out to be, well, this.. You deserve better. Please don't do anything at all to keep this guy around. He isn't worth it."

You deserve so much better than what he is giving you. You aren't a villain. You have strengths and weaknesses, and you are right to think that compassion and better communication could help moderate the effects that your ADHD quirks have on your day to day interactions. 

You might find that you appreciate medication more than you expect to. Or possibly it's not a great help. Even if it does help, though, it's not a panacea. Cultivating a supportive and healthy relationship takes work, whomever you are and whatever issues you may need to work through. If your partner is threatening to move on if he ""finds someone more stable"", he doesn't seem like he's willing to put in that work together with you. He's certainly not being very empathetic or supportive.

Please consider letting him go. You deserve better than this. And you're likely to have more success working on your ADHD if you can do so without someone so close to you issuing demands and ultimatums."

* Yes, then starting seeing a therapist and get on meds. Start taking actions to get your ADHD under control. 

* No, get your ADHD together and under control for yourself. 

It's tough to recognize when you need help. You go through so many of the same routines and emotions that you don't see the things your partner does. Sometimes and often times it takes someone that cares about you to stop you and tell you that you need to take care of your shit because it's not just wearing the person down but they can see how it's wearing you down. It's hard to watch the a person wear themselves out due to their neurodivergent thinking and behavior. 

If you've taken medication that's made you feel like a zombie sometimes, that might not be the right meds for you to take. The dosage might be off. It takes time to get it dialed in, but once you do, it feels so much better. Especially when you get to points in therapy and you're like,"" Wait?!!? Thats not a just me thing other people do that too!?"" 

Are you overreacting, no. This is your ADHD reacting. Getting medication, talking to a therapist, and learning tools to help understand how ADHD effects you as well as how to not run yourself out of gas is important for you.

There are just so many psychological/emotional abuse red flags in this post. I know it's hard to see when you're on the inside, and harder to accept. But I've been there, so I do have a little bit of insight. Namely, you don't need to be 'fixed', you're not broken because you have ADHD. If your partner would rather be with the zombie version of you, that means he doesn't want to be with you, he wants to control you. Period.

Whether or not the fights you've described are instigated by you not managing your ADHD well, he is not handling them in a healthy way for either of you. He's being manipulative and either too lazy to learn about your symptoms, or he's the one who's gaslighting you (or both).

>Recently, he‚Äôs also mentioned to me that if he meets someone else that is ‚Äúmore stable‚Äù he will go ahead and take that route rather than wait for me. Which to me is very discouraging because then .. what is the point?

It‚Äôs not about acceptance or adhd really. It‚Äôs whether or not you are being responsible for handling your mental health and it‚Äôs impact on others around you. 

Adhd after all is not an excuse but your struggles are understandable. Adhd also comes with a lot of emotional volatility and lack of consistency that our partners have to accommodate. I think that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs trying to let you know that she‚Äôs willing to work on this if you‚Äôre handling this disability appropriately.

You aren‚Äôt a failure for being who you are but you will not be a good partner if you have a poorly managed mental disorder that you don‚Äôt get properly treated. Other than supporting you, there is little a partner can do. 

Don‚Äôt fix yourself, you‚Äôre fine. Manage the adhd in a responsible & proactive way and see where the chips fall.

It certainly can give rise to contempt and a distaste for certain behaviors especially when it feels like you are being ignored mid conversations or that they can‚Äôt remember anything or put in the effort to try. Truthfully I think ADHD is overhyped and made to seem a lot worse then it actually is and in a subreddit like this everyone here will just agree with the echo chamber of your opinion.

> Edited to add context: I have an appointment to get my meds. I‚Äôm NOT against taking them if it‚Äôs going to make things better. It was just not being done ‚Äúfast enough‚Äù since my appointment wasn‚Äôt until next month. I had to expedite the process through an emergency clinic

So hold on, this isn't a disagreement about whether or not you should take meds, this is about your partner being unwilling to wait *a single month* for you to start? That's incredibly immature at *best*, what the fuck kind of a lack of patience is that shit? Also, does he think that you're going to magically change the moment you start taking them? That's not how this works.

 > Over time, things that before were just occasional inconveniences have turned into massive aggression triggers for him.

I'm *deeply* concerned by this choice of words - a massive *aggression* trigger? Fucking yikes. There's a huge difference between being annoyed/unhappy with certain behaviours and getting aggressive over them. If he's getting *aggressive*, that's a huge fucking problem - it doesn't matter what you're doing to ""trigger"" this.

> Me not remembering very specific details about something. Which to him makes any argument of mine invalid, because I don‚Äôt remember the situation exactly how it happened. So I‚Äôm ‚Äògaslighting‚Äô.

When he says you're ""everything he wants,"" this is what he means. He means your ADHD, because it lets him do this to you, and you won't question it. He *wants* someone who has a disorder like ours, because it gives him the power to screw with you and control you: ""because I don‚Äôt remember the situation exactly how it happened"" -- sweetie, ***neither does he***. Human memory - even NT memory - is hilariously awful. I guarantee that he's wrong on some detail of most of these events. But he can use your ADHD to convince you that *he* is the authority on everything that has happened in the past. He's NT and you're not, so if there's ever a disagreement over what happened, both of you automatically assume that he's right. And that means he can basically tell you anything about how something happened, and you'll be inclined to believe him.

That? That's *actually* gaslighting. He's gaslighting you. Gaslighting is when you maliciously undermine someone's ability to trust their own memories and senses in order to place them under your control. That is *literally* what he's doing to you, here. The term gets misused all the time, but this is very much the textbook example of what the term actually means. It would almost be funny that he's using the term ""gaslighting"" as part of his efforts to gaslight you, but there's nothing funny about the awful situation he's put you in, here.

> Not fully being able to keep up with a long conversation. ( Says I don‚Äôt care to listen)

Again, I'm really concerned by the fact that he's insisting that you're intentionally hurting him when you're not. You can easily be *unable* to do something even if you care a lot. Accusing you of not *caring* despite the fact that he seems to be aware that this is a symptom of your ADHD is very concerning - he knows it's not your fault, but he's guilting you as if you're doing it on purpose anyway.

> I personally feel like the things mentioned above are things that can be fixed with a little bit more of compassion and communication. But he‚Äôs not having it.

If he's not having it now, then he's not going to have it when you start your meds, either. Meds are not magic - you're not going to suddenly and magically develop a perfect memory and focus. Compassion and communication are necessary whether you're on meds or not.

> Recently, he‚Äôs also mentioned to me that if he meets someone else that is ‚Äúmore stable‚Äù he will go ahead and take that route rather than wait for me.

So you're willing to take medications that you don't want and are rushing yourself through the prescription process because you want so badly to save the relationship... and he can't even be assed to wait a *whole month* without threatening to leave with the first person he meets without ADHD? You see the problem with this picture, right?

> I‚Äôm devastated because I feel like a failure. I try to do anything he says I need to ‚Äòfix‚Äô because I love him, and I want to make him happy, but my friends say these are abusive tactics?

Honey... your friends are right. Literally everything about this screams emotional abuse. I'm not normally one to make sweeping claims like this online because I know we're only getting one side of the story, but in cases like this? It honestly doesn't matter what his side of the story is. Assuming you're being even remotely honest about this, the best he could do with his side of the story is to go from extremely emotionally abusive to ""only"" moderately emotionally abusive, which is like... not a great improvement, lol.

> I mentioned to him that I was scared of getting medication because it makes me feel like a ‚Äòzombie‚Äô sometimes. But he responded that he would probably like that more than me, currently. Is that shitty to say?

Yes.

> Am I being taken advantage of?

Yes. He's using your ADHD to undermine your autonomy and power, to place you under his control, and that's ***fucked up.***

> Because I AMwilling to do anything for them to stay‚Ä¶

Please don't. In fact, even if he is willing to stay, *you* should leave. You don't deserve this treatment."

I do all this, because I want to be better, and do better. 

My partner is a huge motivator for all of this, but ultimately I am the one who wants to change, and the one willing to go through all the challenges to get better. 

It sounds like your partner wants you to take medication, but doesn't have a realistic outlook on how that will go. It also doesn't sound like they are supportive or understanding.

I know how easy it is to feel like we can‚Äôt properly evaluate a long series of events in relationships because of our memory issues, but listen to those alarm bells because they DO remember. People with ADHD (and other neurological/psychological disorders) are statistically far more likely to be victims of abuse, and in my personal experiences, this was in part due to how easily the other person could convince me to doubt my own judgement. I hope posting here and hearing so many people validate your concerns and assure you this is NOT a healthy or safe relationship, helps you to feel like you can trust your own judgement, and that you absolutely deserve a better partner that truly supports you and cheers you on.

Please, leave your partner. The fact that they said you are everything they want but then say they would probably like you better if you were more like a zombie? That's not okay. In the slightest. 

Your partner is trying to manipulate you. Hands down. End of story. Any decent person would never say the things they have said. 

I know it's scary and sad that you need to leave them, but I promise you it's worth it. You will be better off. 

On another note, if you feel like medication isn't for you, that's okay! However, I suggest talking with medical professional about the medication and trying a few different ones. Medication affects everyone differently. 

Medication is never a cure. Essentially, our brains are like the wacky inflatable tube guys, they're moving and it's very hard for our neurons to make the connections. The meds help our brains make the connections a little easier. Which then helps us to focus on a certain task rather than all of them at once, it can help us remember etc. It doesn't just make you get up and do things, that still requires self-discipline.

He has to read on ADHD and work on what he can control, which is his behavior and reactions. He has to be more patient with you.

You have to get on your meds and monitor your side effects and talk with your psychiatrist along the way to determine if you need a different prescription or higher dosis. And work through chores and life things with reminders, loving accountability and fun tactics. 

Lots of patience and time are required here.

Him saying that if he found another stable partner, that he would leave you is so cruel. Tbh, I have had this thought! Esp at moments of most frustration. But I would never verbalize it to my ADHD partner.

And then the rejection sensitivity and impulsivity can make us be really shitty to someone for trying to let us know that our actions are causing them pain, so that they get even MORE pain for trying to get us to help them feel less pain from our behavior. 

If you think about it it really sucks. For both people. Sucks for us if we mostly get negative feedback. Sucks for them that they can't say ouch and just have us comfort them about it because our own needs take priority. 

I practically gave my partner an ultimatum that he has to get therapy about his need to do this to me all the time. I didnt say or else blah blah but I feel like that. It's hard to be with someone that never takes responsibility for the impact of their behavior. Intentions matter but they don't erase the impact of our actions. In his case some of it is helped by meds but it's really his coping mechanisms that I need him to address. 

I have ADHD too, but if he calls me out for something I might feel yucky but I try to be receptive because I know how crazy making it is to experience the other. 

We can have good intentions all day long and still do things that really hurt other people. You can stop to avoid running over an animal and still cause the person in the car behind you to get an injury if they don't also stop in time. You did a good thing but someone was still hurt as a result. 

Denial and defensiveness can make all of this really hard. Maybe your partner is a narcissist. Maybe your actions are hurting them more than you think, and they tried to tell you, and they feel like you won't listen, so anger is all they have left. 

I'm not saying what he did is right. I'm saying I can understand the desperation he might feel. Sounds like he feels really unheard and that sucks bc I'm sure you don't mean to make it feel like that to him."

Please leave this person and cut them out of your life. It will only get worse if you stay because no matter what they tell you the real cause has nothing to do with you or anything about you and they will treat anyone they're with this way.

I come from a background of severe domestic abuse and I recognize everything you described. Please save yourself. Even if you love them they aren't going to ever love you or anyone else in return and it would be a tragedy to sacrifice your life and happiness to try to gain their love when they will only abuse you for it. Not to mention what life would be like for your future children.

Please start researching narcissism, sociopathy, and domestic violence. There is a lot of literature out there about relationships with narcs and SPs that go exactly as you've described in your post. There is a very high chance that your S.O. falls into one or both of these categories. It's important to do your research without your S.O.'s knowledge. Please take good care of yourself and know that your ADHD is no reason whatsoever for someone to treat you badly like your S.O. has done. Good luck."

BUT not in this case. Break up with him. He is a toxic abusive person.

It is not ok that he said he would leave you if he met someone ‚Äúmore stable‚Äù. The person you are with long term should want to be with you more than anyone else. They should not be with you because they ‚Äúcan‚Äôt get anyone better‚Äù.

He should NOT be saying he‚Äôd prefer you as a zombie. You share with him your fear of losing your sense of self/identity and he responds by saying ‚Äúit would be easier for HIM???‚Äù

Run from this man. He does not love you. Not really. He does not want to help you, he wants to control you. This is incredibly abusive behavior.

Thoughts?","This is... not as simple on its face as one might like, especially without knowing the details of *why* he says these things. His concerns may be legitimate but he lacks the emotional maturity or vocabulary to voice them that way.

#SHORT ANSWER FOR YOU:

- You have described your symptoms as 'triggers' for his 'massive aggression'. Is he merely insulted, or is he angry, accusatory, verbally/physically violent?

- It sounds like he is treated ADHD symptoms as a personality problem (""you don't care to listen"")

- He is allowed to be frustrated that he *feels* unheard, but to accuse you of deciding he isn't *worth* being heard is unfair.

- He's accused you of gaslighting, while simultaneously invalidating your own feelings because you can't sufficiently 'justify' them.

**So the ultimate conclusion is that your alarm bells are legitimate.**

#But let's talk about ADHD in relationships in general:

The reality is that ADHD *does* impact relationships, really heavily: we have incredibly low rates of marriage.

Compared to those without ADHD, we're messy, we're emotional firecrackers, we struggle to contribute to a household, we're impulsive, often financially irresponsible, we take unmeasured risks, we're loud and disruptive... ***We're exhausting.***

***People can genuinely love us and still find that true.*** A relationship is not a moral imperative; if you are difficult to be around, or if a person feels like they need to 'parent' their partner, they're allowed to leave. (In fact, parentalism is a relationship killer.)

Relevant anecdote:

> When my depression was especially bad in my mid-twenties, my best friend told me he had to stop talking to me until I was medicated. He didn't make that decision for me, it wasn't to manipulate or control me.

> *But* my mood was affecting our time together, all the time. I was using him as a therapist instead of seeking ways to improve my situation, and he was finding it draining and it had started affecting his own health, too. **He was allowed to make that boundary.**

> I ended up getting medicated a couple weeks after, because I realised he was right, and he's still my best friend today. Though I was only medicated for a few months, I am far healthier, more productive, and much happier than I was back then.

**FOR YOU:** There is no cure for ADHD, only is treatment. Treatment still wears off at the end of the day. You are in charge of *your own* medical decisions. You can work to manage your symptoms without medicating them; it is in our best interests to always be trying to improve ourselves.

**FOR A PARTNER:** If the relationship as it stands is wearing on somebody, they're allowed to conclude that it can't be maintained and leave. If they have to 'take care of' you all the time, if the feel the pressure to provide for you, if they have to constantly clean up after you, if their emotions and needs aren't being validated and met by you, it is for their own health that they leave.

A relationship requires two people to want it. There's no 'moral high ground' where our *very real disability* obliges partners to stay. Both people enter a relationship with standards and needs, including emotional. If we can't meet each others' needs, we're incompatible.

**It is possible that your partner was genuinely supportive initially, but the increased weight of managing both of your needs by himself has contributed to the changed dynamic.** If so, the same thing is likely to happen to any other relationships going forward as well."

There‚Äôs suggesting things to better help you, and then there‚Äôs being rude and pushy about it. Your partner is choosing the latter and ultimately putting his feelings about your diagnosis far below how you feel. This is not fair to you in the slightest.

If he cannot fix this and continues to be pushy and undermine your ADHD, I highly suggest seeing your way out of the relationship. Best of luck OP."

"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","My first marriage was a lot like you've described here, just no diagnosis to leverage. He often used my poor physical and mental health against me, and when guilt failed he would flat out gaslight me. That man really destroyed my sense of reality, and it left me reeling in a relationship in which I was never doing the right thing with someone who delighted in punishing me for it. 

My marriage now is to a very healthy, well adjusted, caring man. We have only just learned of my adhd recently, so he has lived with my undiagnosed symptoms and issues for quite a while. He helps me manage and cope, and he is always kind and loving when doing it. And if he cant be, he tells me ""I'm sorry my bucket is full, I cant deal with xyz right now.""  

I am a big believer that if you arent well, the onus is on you is to do what is in your power to help yourself. If my husband gave me an ultimatum like that, and I wasnt taking steps to get better(or didnt recognize I was having a problem) I dont think I'd fault him.  But if however, like you I had a treatment plan on the books and the steps were being made--I'd be livid. We'd be having some serious future determining conversations. Because that is incredibly unfair, if not down right cruel, given the state of the world right now and the massive waiting period on getting care. It took me a few weeks to start with my therapist, and then over a month of sessions for her to diagnose. From there, another 8 week wait for a med appointment(AFTER being denied care at my primpary care flat out.)  

I really think you should find yourself someone who doesnt have to be angry that you require a little more patience and kindness. Find someone who will help you thrive instead of survive. Threatening to leave you at the drop of a hat, and framing as something you're doing to YOURSELF, is not something a good, caring, loving partner would do. I dont care what the relationship is. Good people dont do that. They stay or they leave.

You're doing the right things. 

You're taking the steps. 

He's showing you who he is.

I'd believe him."

I think that the more important question is if these things are things that are really frustrating to you or are they just frustrating because he says they are? The threats are really unsettling. You deserve someone who isn‚Äôt always looking for something better! 

I mostly wanted to respond because the issue about clarifying intentions before apologizing really stood out to me! This is something I know I do and have learned that it does sometimes feel insincere to people! I found Brene Browns podcast episode with Harriet Lerner super helpful! She talks about focusing your apology of apologizing, but setting aside a separate time to clarify intentions and ask for your needs! There‚Äôs a bunch of other great stuff in there, but I found it transformative!! 

Anyway! Sorry to zero in on one thing! You are enough and deserve someone who knows that and shows you that with or without medication! Wishing you all the best!"

This is both new to us but, it is absolutely not such a cause for concern that he would ever leave me because of it. He loves me freely without conditions or ultimatums.

You deserve that kind of love. A kind, caring, & deeply patient kind of love. The kind of love that cheers you on for making the bed & sees the little improvements as major wins.

You deserve credit for all you go through. This person need to understand what you go through every moment of every day and just how hard it is for you to constantly fight your own mind.  

If your partner truly cares about you they will try to understand and support you. I can tell you from experience if the person you love is more concerned with you getting help for there own benefit then actually making you happy, even with medicine they wont be satisfied unless you are a perfectly functioning person and you'll never be good enough for them. You'll spend countless hours being told what your doing wrong how your not trying or how you dont care.

The remarks about you 'gaslighting' because you don't remember something well is something that really bothers me, *your* memory can't be trusted (according to them) so *you're the one gaslighting.* That sounds kinda like they're trying to get you to doubt your own memories. AKA gaslighting...

I'd really strongly reconsider the relationship. If they're ready to drop you if someone 'stable' comes along or you don't get on meds I don't think it's gonna end well. 

They sound uncommunicative, kinda abusive and just unpleasant. Demanding your partner go on medication is not really a good sign for your relationship. Especially if you've said it makes you feel like a zombie and that's apparently a-ok for them."

The medicine I‚Äôm on now helps, and I don‚Äôt feel like a zombie, and the side effects aren‚Äôt bad. Previous ones I lost 10 pounds, felt drowsy, etc. but I worked through until I found it.

Now, I say you should leave him ASAP. Beyond ADHD red flags, he‚Äôs saying a lot of things that are major red flags in general. Of course there‚Äôs other stuff but he really doesn‚Äôt seem willing to work in a relationship, he just wants a partner that he doesn‚Äôt have to work for. Those things that are ADHD are able to be worked through, and he should be supporting you when those things happen, not shutting you down.

My source is my own experience. Diagnosed ADHD in my single digit years, tried medicine through middle school, off 9th-10th, back on 11th-present. A relationship from late 18‚Äô to late ‚Äò19 was a struggle dealing with the red flags you are dealing with, and hating myself. 20‚Äô was terrible but I learned a lot and how to love and grow as who I am, and accept my ADHD traits and accept that it‚Äôs never going to be easy to beat. My current partner asked me out late 20‚Äô, now we live together and she supports me and my issues, is understanding, and even when I do some stupid shit that makes her upset, we always resolve and there‚Äôs never leftover anger from any situation. It‚Äôs possible. Lots of communication and love is the answer. Trying to make someone be something they‚Äôre not? Never the answer. 

It doesn‚Äôt mean you shouldn‚Äôt search solutions and be working against your symptoms. Medicine is a route, but it‚Äôs not for everyone. It‚Äôs helped me, but it‚Äôs not the biggest helper.

Youre not some horribly mentally ill person who needs to be on meds so they dont hurt themselves or others, youre not blowing all of your rent money on junk, youre not causing fires every other day, youre not having emotional breakdowns every other second; you are being the most basic definition of a person with ADHD,  and putting that over your head is in my opinion at least a little manipulative.

My ex was alot like this, and I spent months crying and hating myself for not being the girl he wants no matter how hard I tried, and it crushed my self esteem so much to the point where I questioned if its possible for anyone to love me and i stayed with him for no other reason than because I thought he was the only person who‚Äôd love me. It hurt like hell leaving, but what finally caused me to leave was the realization that i was doing EVERYTHING to fix myself and this relationship and he was doing nothing. I put myself in therapy just to try and ‚Äúfix myself‚Äù and he was so combative with every single thing I suggested to help us and help us communicate better that I realized that I would never be what he wanted and i was killing my self in the process.

Im not going to say leave him, because im sure you have your reasons for being with him. But please try to pay attention for these signs, what he is asking of you is ALOT, so what is HE doing to also try and help? Is he suggesting you both go to couples counseling? Is he trying to learn about your condition so that he can better adjust to you? Is he being encouraging while you try to strive for betterment?

This sounded a bit like burnout to me. Small things are no big deal, but when they build up over time, they can start feeling huge. Overtime, it wears on you and can really burn you out. My partner has expressed major frustration about my medication (still trying to find the right med/dosage), and it took a big fight for me to realize he was burned out from nagging me. That sucked. 

But the word ""aggression"" in your post though makes me wary. Tired, frustrated, pissed off... but *aggressive*? That's worrying.  


>Recently, he‚Äôs also mentioned to me that if he meets someone else that is ‚Äúmore stable‚Äù he will go ahead and take that route rather than wait for me. Which to me is very discouraging because then .. what is the point?

However this \^ was the turning point for me. This kind of threat doesn't sound like ""Hey I need you to get your shit together or I might need to leave this relationship."" Which can happen. Instead, **he's deliberately threatening to replace you**. Not leave. Replace. That doesn't sound very loving. 

If you need to get your shit together - do it. But really sit down and think about your relationship. 

Sometimes we get so caught up trying to be the right person for someone else -- that we forget to check in with ourselves and ask ""Is this person what ***I*** want? Is this relationship enough for ***me***?"" Right now, you're stuck continuously trying to prove to him that you're good enough for him. But is this relationship enough *for you*?"

Thoughts?","You and your ADHD live in the same body.  You can't magically cut it out.  If your partner can't understand that, no you are not ""everything they want"".

It sounds like what has happened is that who you are is being turned into pathological symptoms.  Not everything about you is part of your ADHD.  That's so important to understand.  You're still a person with traits and flaws.  If you take meds and they work perfect, that won't all magically go away.  On the flip side, there are new things that tend to appear.  Please take a step back and listen to what is really being said to you.  You must fix who you are to be loved.

Now that's not to say that meds can't improve your life.  They absolutely can.  They are also not perfect and there can be a lot of trial and error.  As a female in her 40s who only recently started on medication, it's been a mess for me.  I'm also finding that since I'm hitting an age where my hormones are fluctuating more, I can go an entire week where they just suddenly don't work.  That's not uncommon at all.  So what I'm trying to say that even the best medication out there won't be magic 24/7.  Yes, absolutely pursue it.  There will STILL be ups and down.  If the ultimatum is getting things under control, they likely still won't be satisfied.l because control will never be a permanent state for the rest of your life.

With all that said... This person is terrible.  Please leave.  I say this with all the wisdom of someone who spent 20 years in a marriage CONSTANTLY compensating for all things ""wrong with me"".  I've had a chance to rebuild my life.  I've found someone who actually accepts me. ALL OF ME.  When I want to seek treatment for something, he's there to support but he would never think he had the right to demand something like that.

Your partner is already saying it all.  1. If you don't change the core of who you are by any means necessary, they're out.  2.  They have admitted they are looking around.

And finally I know you said you'd do anything to keep them.  No.  That's the first step to codependency.  It's always important to learn in grow in life but never give who you are up for anyone.  Anyone who demands it is never worth it."

I‚Äôm not saying that to be mean, I absolutely swear. I like you! But many people don‚Äôt like us, because we don‚Äôt act as expected. I‚Äôve been in a few relationships now where, after a few years, I start to realize the person I‚Äôm with likes *the idea of me* more than they actually like me. 

I‚Äôm attractive, I have a mechanical engineering degree, I usually look very put together. From the outside, I look like a catch. 

But I have strange needs because of my weird brain; I don‚Äôt trust my own perception so I need to be periodically reassured that my spouse finds me attractive (honestly I‚Äôd like constant, honest feedback about my appearance from someone other than myself but my husband can‚Äôt seem to understand that). I don‚Äôt like the engineering field. 

My last husband saw someone he could mold; someone young and naive, intelligent enough to get a good enough degree (if he could sway me away from teaching, which he did of course). 

My current husband seems like he feels like I‚Äôm wasting money *we* could be making if I don‚Äôt use my degree for work; nevermind that the last time I was honestly happy, I was working in restaurants. 

I regret not being myself unapologetically in the beginning. I wish I had scared *every ‚Äúnormie‚Äù* away, instead of masking myself to attract them. I wish my husband loved me unconditionally, instead of having to be worried that if I‚Äôm not good enough financially, or physically, or if I have too many feelings and thoughts and problems and he gets too annoyed, he‚Äôll stop loving me. 

My advice is to leave. I love my husband too much now to divorce him, but I‚Äôm moving out and going home to my parents for a few months. Gonna work in a restaurant, be long distance and do a lot of talking over the phone and in text with my husband (which ironically could help us with our problems, because he‚Äôll talk more than he does in person). 

It‚Äôll either help us, or break us apart, but either way something needed to change.

üö© Why the rush? If you're going to be long-term partners, you should both be willing to put in the time to manage mental health conditions. 

>... he was aware of my ‚Äòproblem‚Äô and acted very ‚Äòaccepting‚Äô of it at the beginning. 

üö© If nothing changed in your relationship or in his understanding of ADHD, it's likely that it always bothered him (perhaps unconsciously). Keeping your feelings a secret (even if it's to protect your partner's feelings) is a sign of a communication problem at minimum or manipulation at worst. For now, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt and assume communication. 

>Over time, things that before were just occasional inconveniences have turned into massive aggression triggers for him. 

üö© ""Massive aggression triggers"" alone is a red flag.

üö© New aggression over things that have been there for a while is a sign of controlling behavior. My concern is this escalating further. This is an early warning sign, and I'm starting to reconsider my earlier stance on giving the benefit of the doubt.

 >Me clarifying my actual intentions things before apologizing for saying or doing something that upset him. He takes it as me ‚Äòmaking excuses‚Äô. 

üö© It sounds like you're putting in the effort to communicate. It also sounds like these efforts are going unreciprocated. 

>All these, among other things, have made him believe that my ADHD is the reason our relationship is problematic and I need to get medication or else he cannot be with me. I personally feel like the things mentioned above are things that can be fixed with a little bit more of compassion and communication. But he‚Äôs not having it. 

üö© Meds are a treatment, not a cure. His expectations here aren't fully reasonable. Also, good on you for that insight on communication and compassion. 

>Recently, he‚Äôs also mentioned to me that if he meets someone else that is ‚Äúmore stable‚Äù he will go ahead and take that route rather than wait for me. 

üö© This is a common manipulation tactic. I won't speak for your partner's intentions specifically, but oftentimes these sorts of threats on the relationship are used as strategies to coerce the partner into giving into demands. 

>I mentioned to him that I was scared of getting medication because it makes me feel like a ‚Äòzombie‚Äô sometimes. But he responded that he would probably like that more than me, currently. Is that shitty to say?

I don't think you're overreacting, and I do agree that the problems you've pointed out are in fact problems. Some of these problems might be solvable with some guidance, a bunch of buy-in from both of you, and boat loads of communication. Then again, they might not be. Before you decide where to go from here, I'd strongly recommend you first ask yourself if this is something worth saving. Are you happy? Is this working for you?"

What they are proposing is borderline abusive. There is no cure for ADHD. And this is who we are. The meds work. And hard work with certain types of therapy work too. But at the end of the day all those things will happen sometimes. They won't every go away 100%. 

Relationships are partnerships and they require work from both partners. So there is nothing wrong with trying to be a better partner. But he needs to meet you in the middle. He needs to understand who you are. And it's very clear he isn't interested in doing that. 

What he is saying is emotional abuse. He is putting all this burden on you. He is also saying he is looking for someone else. Which means he isn't committed. He isn't interested in doing the work. 

And lastly, and I cannot stress this enough, don't go on medication for your partner! Do it for yourself if YOU will benefit from it.

Partners should he supportive. If they cared about you he would say ""I see you struggle sometimes, I really think you should talk to your doctor about medication it would help you out a lot."" That's one thing. But if he is saying ""get better or im gone"" he is only thinking about himself.

And also... to *prove* that I was actively listening to him he frequently asked me to repeat his exact words back to him. Couldn't ever do it.

There are plenty of happy couples where one partner can't stand the other when they aren't medicated but are very happy together when they are meditated.
Some people (myself include) are just hard to deal with when unmedicated. It may not only be a problem with your current partner, if you two break up your future partner/s may also take issue with it. 
No sense in virtue signaling as if they aren't good for you. Medication might make the relationship workable."

If your not doing anything to fix your adhd, dont expect other ppl to have patience for it.

(Not saying meds will fix the problem. But if your not doing anything that shows ur attempting to fix things, even if they dont work 100% pther ppl wont have patience. )

Imagine having to cover work for someone who has a crohnic headaches. But they refuse to see a doctor about it. Youd get pretty over covering their shift pretty fast.

I did this and got better for someone and it turned out that once I was medicated I realized that I didn‚Äôt really like how she treated me and how I felt around her so I was better and off doing my thing (she didn‚Äôt like that either) and left her cause she was miserable."

Thoughts?","To be clear, there is a role for ultimatums in mental health. ""Get help with this or I'm gone,"" is an awful thing to hear, but sometimes it needs to be said.

This is NOT one of those times. 

First red flag, your SO is dictating the type of help you are to get. ""Get help with this"" can take many forms, of which ""get on medication"" is only one form.   It's not your SO's call as to whether the meds are helping you, it's yours.

Second red flag: saying he would prefer you as a zombie. Apart from the obvious connotation, this was you expressing your fears of trying medication, and those fears should be met with sympathy, or at least acknowledged.

Third: sounds like he's already hoping to play the field, and looking for an excuse. 

Fourth: his fantasies of how you will be ""better"" on meds sounds like symptomizing. If there's something one partner does that the other doesn't like, there's supposed to be a conversation, negotiation and compromise, not immediately jumping to the fact that one of you is broken and should be fixed by medical science."

You and only you should  decide whether you need to be medicated. Sometimes the medication is too much. Sometimes you need rest. Sometimes others are boundary over stepping jerks. Taking stimulants is expensive and there are risks. Unless you're hurting others people who try to control your habits need to find something better to do.

I'm not gonna pretend like I think meurodivergent people should be given a full pass all the time. I have done hurtful things in the past and blamed them on my ADHD. Even though the adhd influenced my actions it doesn't overwrite the fact that I LIVE with adhd. I have to compensate and adjust differently because of my adhd. HOWEVER, the people who really love you should expect that sometimes you're gonna act like someone who has adhd, because you do.

If he truly can't accept you as you are when you're not on meds then he won't accept you once you start taking them. Your meds wont be active all day, every hour, everytime you see him.

I'm not saying that mental illness can cause problems or there isn't a certain level of accountability to be taken for the toll that symptoms can have on everybody, it's certainly a thing as I've experienced more with my OCD, but the way your partner is talking about it is NOT how you have a conversation about it, it comes across as incredibly manipulative and controlling in my opinion, do what you think is best but please evaluate how safe and cared about and respected you feel in this relationship because those are not things that should be negotiable in a relationship."

Yes, is very difficult sometimes to live with someone with adhd and yes, others get annoyed or angry at us because we do things that are annoying or that they don't understand, we forget stuff or can't keep track on conversation (not always, adhd can be different for everyone), but is very important for them to know that this is a life long condition and that we aren't gonna change just after taking a pill. Adhd can be managed with certain rutines and in some cases with medication and therapy of course but is still gonna be there. 

I take medication and I've notice that it helps me but something that has really help me is rutines and writing things down in a calendar that I stick to the wall or use an agenda that I check daily.

Please consider talking with your partner again and try to explain that by taking a pill you aren't magically change to a neurotipycal person, if your partner accepts you for who you are and learns how to treat a person with a condition (and maybe help)then great if not is would be a good idea to reevaluate the relationship.

Also about medication, there a few types of meds, the most common is methylphenidate wich is an stimulant that acts over dopamine. This one sometimes makes you feel like a zombie (not always and not to everyone), also the crash after it wears off can be ugly.

Other type of med is atomoxetime, is a non stimulant that acts on the norepinephrine. This last one is a b...when starting on it but is helpful and they don't give the side effects of the stimulants. I used to take methylphenidate and then my doc switch it to the non stimulant. Always ask your doc because there are other types of medication besides the ones I mentioned and sometimes you need to try a few to have the one that helps you the most. (Sorry for my english, is not my first language but I hope you can understand).

Another thing, tell all to your doc, if you have other health conditions (so he or she know wich medication is more suitable for you) or what you feel after taking the med, etc."

Lets play out this scenario, you stay together, you get married, later in life he gets a bad back and can't do things like he did before.

Do you suddenly give him an ultimatum to get on pain pills or your out?

I don't see a difference. His behavior is self centered and cruel. He is showing you who HE is, not the other way around. Do yourself a favor and find a partner who accepts you and loves you medicated or not and who doesn't pressure your medical decisions based on their own needs."

He isn't trying to get you to get help for yourself it is for his interest.  That is narcissism 101.

Thoughts?","Your friends are right, and your partner is behaving like a real dick. Notice how he says you're unstable and he'll break up if you don't take meds, but he also accuses you or acting deliberately when you show symptoms of the disorder. His position has no internal consistency except that he is always right and you are wrong.

He sounds like the kind of person who is prone to bullying and tends to date people who have low self-esteem because they're easier to manipulate and control. ADHD makes us very vulnerable to these types of relationships, and that low self-esteem makes it harder for us to leave them.

I think that once your meds start working for you, you will be able to see things with greater clarity. You don't need this man.

I wish you all the best, and I hope that your partner starts getting therapy of his own so that he will be capable of healthy relationships in the future."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","The whole reason I stopped taking adhd meds was because they made me feel like a zombie same as you. 

I had no emotions, no care, no nothing it felt like. But yeah I could focus longer. 

After a while and a lot of hardwork focusing on myself and what I can do to help. I was able to fix a lot of issues. If I couldn't remember all the details to a story, I wouldn't say I can't remember. I'll say I can't recall right now, it'll come back to me. Haven't had any issues with anyone since I've started using that phrase. 

If you actually feel like a zombie when you take the meds like I did, it might be best to stop and start putting loads of effort into yourself. The problem is never going to go away, but you can definitely make it a much easier problem to deal with. Good luck!"

Finding the right dose and med should help you feel ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, a better version of yourself, and be like glasses for your brain. You can also avoid the zombie feeling by taking days off, or doing days where you take lower doses (if on IR). YMMV, but when I was in college and always took 10mg 3x/day, I became very robotic. Couldn‚Äôt laugh in class. Tired a lot but wired. Not fun. My doctor urged me to take breaks and weekends off, or taking 5mg 3x a day when I could. I wish I had listened to him. I didn‚Äôt and I quit it and my life fell apart for the next 7 years. Back on meds now and so happy to have a chance at life again. YMMV. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre having someone give you an ultimatum and putting you down so much. Most ADHDers are hard enough on themselves, so we need supportive and compassionate partners, which is not what you currently have."

My ex would also give me shit about having a messy room and said I was not managing well. He also turned out to be super controlling and abusive and would use ADHD to make me feel bad and manipulate me into doing stuff or making me feel like I forgot him paying me back when he really didn't because he knew I was self conscious about it already and would likely cave if ADHD got brought into it."

Thoughts?","Please take this with all the grains of salt, it doesn't speak to ADHD specifically (which I am medicated for) but it speaks to a personal anecdote regarding a relationship and medication.

I  once gave an ultimatum to a girl I was dating and crazy about making sure she took her meds for bipolar disorder.  The reason I did that is because she was honest with me about her particular malady and I really liked her and she basically taught me that that part of bipolar disorder manifests itself in not taking meds.  I researched and learned all I could about what it meant to date someone like that and decided I was up for the ride.

When she didn't take her meds she would inevitably find herself on a bender.  When she took the meds, life was blissful, but she was convinced she didn't need them.

Once after she had been refusing to take them, because that's what her demon told her was the right thing to do, she dumped me.  I accepted the dumping, broke out of there tout suite, and never looked back.

ADHD and Bipolarity are not the same, no.  But one thing they share is an evil little fucker in your brain that tells you don't need the drug when you have been in the routine of taking them.  Maybe your partner sees a thing you can't."

Personally the meds help me a lot. I remember things for my kids and get tasks done. That‚Äôs priceless. I clean up and help my wife because she shouldn‚Äôt have to deal with my shit.  Plus I have to take care my end without laying my crap on her. My wife doesn‚Äôt really understand what it‚Äôs like. However she knows how much it just messes with me. That the struggle is frustrating.  

I also know that it affects us in varied ways. Some stim. Some don‚Äôt. I‚Äôve learned so much recently.  


I don‚Äôt know you. To me it sounds like boundaries are being pushed. Additionally it seems that maybe you are a mess. Maybe you need to try different meds and see what works for you. Both trespassing of boundaries (not to mention threats) and the way adhd affects the relationship can be true. I believe partners should be just that.  It‚Äôs a problem to be worked through with each other. 

Good luck."

To play devil's advocate, our symptoms can be really really hard on our partners, especially if they have good executive function and all the other things we lack. It's not uncommon for ADHD to be a point of contention between couples. 

He's being a dick about this, but perhaps he is very frustrated and doesn't know how to communicate his needs or feelings better. ......and its up to us to be responsible and honest about our efforts to be better about our flaws when it comes to ADHD. 

I'm not going to be someone to tell you that should break up with him over this, because I don't know enough background info. 

Remember, that just as you feel helpless with managing your ADHD, your partner may also struggle with communication of this. So I think openness and empathy are going to be needed for you two."

For many of us, medication is a key part of managing our symptoms and functioning as well as we can. I think it‚Äôs reasonable for a partner to want and expect you to do your best to maintain your symptom-management system, but a good partner is forgiving of mistakes and _willing to help you_ keep it all running.

I used to carry a lot of shame and anxiety around struggling to line everything up at the end of the month so that I could get my medication on time without having a gap. I wouldn‚Äôt tell my partner, because I felt like I should be able to figure it out myself. Once, my partner found out that I hadn‚Äôt had my medication for like a week because I kept forgetting to go to the doctor‚Äôs office to pick up my prescription, and he was pretty upset with me for not telling him, because me struggling to function affects him too, and it wasn‚Äôt really fair to put that on him without him knowing what was going on.

And you know, he was right! It wasn‚Äôt fair. But rather than demanding that I ‚Äúfix it‚Äù on my own, he asked me to tell him every time so that we could solve the problem together. And then he made a plan with me to go to the doctor‚Äôs office first thing in the morning together, and then drop the prescription off at the pharmacy before work."

On your end, I get that taking meds might make you not feel like yourself. This is a common thing I've heard. 

But then you have the personality quirks that are clearly annoying and unacceptable to your partner (and likely others).

I can see this is a fucked up ultimatum, but if I were your partner, I'm not sure I'd have stuck around this long, but I would say that it's either meds or let him go. It's just unfortunate that it came out like this in rather a harsh way. He could have been more delicate. 

There may be someone out there who can live with it, so do some soul searching to see if you can and are willing to live on your meds, or if you need to find another partner who can tolerate things as they are. I firmly believe there's someone for everyone, but maybe this guy just isn't it if you don't want to live and actively treat your ADHD."

First off, medication isn't going to fix you immediately, it's going to help you (hopefully) to manage your symptoms so you can (hopefully) ""fix yourself"".... as in, have the brain capacity to work on developing healthier habits, etc. 

Two, the things you mentioned that he has developed major issues with, frankly don't really sound that bad.  Like maybe if you were so forgetful you accidentally killed his pet... or continually ruined his belongings... or something destructive or terrible, just RUINING HIS DAY over and over. Unless we're missing part of the story... nope, this should not be an ultimatum thing, I suspect strongly. 

Three, your friends are right. This guy sounds like a terrible person to be in a relationship with. He'd prefer you as a zombie? He'd leave you immediately if he found someone more stable? Okay. That doesn't sound like a very healthy relationship. At all. Red flags sis, red flags. 

I know you love him and would do anything. And you might just stay and stick it out but... for your own health and happiness, I, a complete stranger, does not think you're overreacting, that shits.. kinda fucked up. 

Which brings me to FOUR... this sounds like my ex husband and my marriage. Except he didn't believe I had ADHD (we both did), and didn't like taking meds (he was just a regular old addict by the end) and more importantly, didn't like it when *I* took mine. When I didn't I was forgetful and messy and over-apologetic and annoyed the piss out of him. I stayed and stayed, tried my best, loved him through a shit ton of terrible shit he did to me and put me through.

Leaving him was the best decision I ever made but it took me half of our 10 year marriage to be able to do it.  I had doubt cast on him by so many friends and family members during our time together and I didn't listen to a single one, ever. Had to figure that out by myself. 

I wish you the best and I hope you take your new meds, still go see the psych you made an appointment with, and find your path. And for your sake I hope it doesn't involve that asshat. He sounds like a total dick."

My bf and I started dating before I got my diagnosis, he never made comments like that, and since starting medication I‚Äôve gone through so many ups and downs in my moods, I‚Äôve had really horrible days and really good days. He‚Äôs always supportive no matter what, and that‚Äôs what you deserve. That‚Äôs what everyone deserves. What this guy is doing to you is not fair and you need to leave. I‚Äôm not someone that comes onto Reddit & tells people to leave their S/O‚Äôs, but in this situation, I‚Äôm saying it.

Everything he‚Äôs getting mad at you for, are literally symptoms of your ADHD, and they most likely wont completely go away with medication. Medication only dulls it so it‚Äôs easier to decide in your own mind if you‚Äôre going to zone out or not if you‚Äôre bored in a conversation, remembering things is easier but you don‚Äôt just stop forgetting things. The fundamental issue is that he doesn‚Äôt love you for you, and going on medication isn‚Äôt going to change that. 

I‚Äôm so sorry that you‚Äôre dealing with this. Clearly you care for him a lot, to the point where you‚Äôre willing to fast track your treatment for him. I respect that, but he doesn‚Äôt deserve it. In fact, he doesn‚Äôt deserve a second more of your time."

At the very least, you need to be with someone who‚Äôs patient enough to stick it out with you when you‚Äôre struggling the most.

If you never asked for meds before because you felt fine it's too much to ask you to take ADHD meds since they also have their bad sides, and instead working in a system BEFORE the ultimatum would've worked too,, like y'know a test week or month where you both try to work around it and find ways and systems, and if in that case yes your symptoms are still too much it's either him to change or if you're open to meds then you try them.

But I see your edit and I'm still really happy for you, if they're prescribed then it means they have more pros than cons for you so I hope it goes well, and I've never taken Wellbutrin but I remember a year ago my first week of meds I was ecstatic, and not Vyvanse euphoria, just doing the usual impossible but actually simple chores in one setting blew my mind

This person you are with is not accepting, loving, support or even being decent.

I personally think you would be better off without the obvious pressure that he is putting on you. I think you deserve better than this. You deserve a partner that doesn't call you out for gaslighting just because you can't remember specifics it a conversation.

Remember that being yourself and owning character traits that might not be optimal (like maybe forgetting a small chore or having a short attention span) is not some terrible thing. It's not like you're being abusive or cheating. You're forgetting to take out the trash every now and then or maybe your partner needs to repeat a sentence because your attention drifted.

Don't ever feel lesser just because you have these traits. You also have amazing traits. One I know of is that you came here for assistance, you're dealing with your disorder and you really do want to be a partner that makes your SO happy.

(Like you, I had been prescribed Wellbutrin but later switched to Vyvanse). 
I can‚Äôt tell you how much of a game changer this has been for my relationship. The quality of my relationships with everyone in general is far better. I‚Äôm a better listener, I have better impulse control, I‚Äôm able to stay focus on the big picture, my anger doesn‚Äôt get in the way of working things out with my partner. I‚Äôm also better at asserting myself and my boundaries in a more diplomatic manner with less ‚Äútone‚Äù. Overall, I just feel like I have so much more control of myself in my life.  
Take your partner out of the equation (metaphorically speaking) and focus on creating the best system for managing your health and well-being. There is a lot of stigma against meds but they are damn near miracles for those of us that need them.

Those both can't be true at the same time. It's either one or the other. If he accepts that it's because of your illness then he has to also accept that you're not doing it on purpose. And in my experience they all seem like relatively minor symptoms that medication doesn't really fix. 

In all honesty, it sounds to me like he's looking for an excuse to leave you. He may already be looking. And in fairness, based on what you're saying here, good riddance. I'm sure that's not the answer you were looking for but you deserve better than to be accused of what he's saying about you by the person who is supposed to be a support. 

If you're happy with your symptoms without meds then that's a good thing and you shouldn't have to go on them for his sake. If you want to try different medication options to control symptoms (you may have tried things that were stronger than you needed for the symptoms you have, there are other options) that should be done for your own self evolution, not to try to appease someone who sounds like he's not going to be satisfied regardless.

Maybe try the medications if you are genuinely interested for yourself and see if you like the improvements. But regardless of the results, it sounds like it's time to seriously consider the way you're treated in this relationship and whether it has a chance of working long-term."

Your ADHD has a real effect on your relationship and you need to acknowledge that. You need to work on that and that's on you.

Your partner also needs to know that medication isn't going to ""fix"" you, it's just going to help you manage things.

The **BOTH** of you are going to have to come up with systems and techniques in order to help keep your relationship happy and healthy. If either of you can't accept that, then it's probably never going to work.

I have bad news though, cause if **you** can't accept that, or can't be bothered to put in the work, then no relationship you have, this one, one's in the future, are going to work out in the long run.

Example. Just last night we had a whole conversation about how my lack of mindfulness leads me to throw my towels and knock things over in the bathroom without realizing it and I don‚Äôt pick it up because I don‚Äôt ‚Äúsee‚Äù it since it‚Äôs on the floor. We talked about the sort of ‚Äúdressing fury‚Äù I go into when I‚Äôm late to get dressed every morning for work which is why I throw things around in a time crunch panic and we are slowly problem solving by thinking of solutions. If I notice something, I‚Äôll try to remember him and put in the extra effort to pick it up if I see it.

You deserve better and you don‚Äôt need someone to tell you you‚Äôre doing everything wrong for the rest of your life. Even if you are doing things wrong, it takes TIME and effort to fix things and learn and you can‚Äôt just expect someone to magically ‚Äúget better‚Äù with meds or by telling them something a couple of times. It takes lots of gentle nagging and communication to work through these issues usually. Find someone who meshes with you and at least somewhat understands.

seriously, i feel for you because this is hard, but he is essentially telling you right here that he is not going to be willing to stick it out, be patient and compassionate, and work WITH you on issues in the future, which are inevitable.

1) i understand the struggle of being with someone whose brain works differently than your own, but... these are not the kinds of problems that a partner shouldn't be able to be patient and figure out along with you. If you were doing something that was hurtful to him constantly that would be different, but forgetting things and communicating differently than what he thinks is the ""right way"" are not things that make someone not a good partner. it's ridiculous that he sees these things as deal breakers.

2) there is a difference between saying ""hey, i would like you to get some help because i feel we need more support, i'm struggling with my frustration with x and i think it would help if you would consider doing x"" 
vs making an ultimatum like ""if you don't do this IMMEDIATELY i'm going to leave you"" especially as it is something you are TRYING to do??? wtf he's saying there is a time limit to how long he can ""deal with you."" 
(of course there are reasons to warn someone with a consequence or to give up on fixing a relationship, but again none of the things youre doing are hurtful or intentional.)

You are correct and so are your friends. He is abusive and while what he wants might normally a reasonable request, it sounds like he is using it to try and control you. That comment about leaving is textbook abuse. It's to make you feel bad and scared of losing him so that you'll do anything he says to keep the relationship together. Even if someone is thinking it, that's not something someone would say to their partner in a healthy, loving relationship. It's OK to have personal deal breakers, but you don't use them to hurt your partner and issue ultimatums. 

Edit: My partner struggles with my symptoms sometimes, but he never makes me feel bad about having adhd. He shares his concerns and we work together to try and manage them. Occasionally he says something that is unintentionally hurtful, but he always apologizes. He listens, tries to understand the struggles I go though, and helps me find ways to deal with things."

He targeted you **because** of your ADHD, he was always going to use it against you, and I predict that if you stay with him and go on medication, then he will flip and say that the medication is the problem, because he won‚Äôt like it when you are more focused and able to see what he‚Äôs up to.

Moreover, his expectations of what will improve when you go on medication are bordering on fantastical. 

If medication is the only way you'll be ""everything he wants,"" then you aren't everything he wants. I'm sorry. I encourage you to communicate with him that this is a part of you and meds won't magically fix these things from happening. They won't be in your system in the evenings and you have every right to go off them on weekends if you choose. It's your body. Not his. There's also a significant adjustment period where you may need to adjust dosage, what time of day you take them, if that particular ADHD medication is even the best one for you‚Ä¶? Your boyfriend should love you for who you are and should encourage you to help yourself. Not to help him tolerate your behavior. 

This is why I never seem to date NTs.

Edit: also seriously, threatening to leave is manipulative and gross. You have ADHD and that means you may very well have RSD and that makes the break up threat an easy tactic for any partner you have.

"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","For context, I am a non ADHD individual who has been in a committed and deeply fulfilling but deeply troubled relationship with an ADHD individual for almost ten years. 

The first thing I want to say is that the way non ADHD people experience ADHD (through the people that have the disorder) can be very different from the way the ADHD person experiences it / communicates to others about it. Its not a matter of who's right or who's wrong or who's lying; it simply comes down to the fact that our brain chemistry is so different that, sometimes or on some things, it's almost impossible to relate to. Lots of animals have eyes, but based on how the eye is structured and what its meant to perceive, you can show a human, a snake, and a crab the same thing, but they will see entirely different images. And they will never be able to see what the other creatures see. They can try to imagine or picture it, but they will never actually see it. 

The second thing I want to say (and for this point, I can only speak for my partner and myself specifically) is that he sometimes will say I blame everything on his ADHD when I am very clear that I do not feel that way. While I am quite certain that his ADHD is the root cause and while i would love to be able to get rid of it (as would he, I know), and I wont deny that I've gotten quite frustrated with him on occasion, I do make it clear that I understand it isn't his choice or his fault. Yet when he gets really scared and insecure, he still asks me why I gang up on him for something he can't control. 

My point is this: try to consider the possibility that your logic isn't fully reaching or connecting with your partner. You have this disorder, you have to live with it, and you're THIS confused. Try to imagine what its like for someone who doesn't have the disorder, someone whose brain will never be as faultily wired, to try and relate to you. Try to consider the possibility that you are inevitably extremely sensitive to this topic. Ask yourself if all the statements you made in your original post are objectively true or subjectively true only. I don't know your situation and I won't make any assumptions or accusations. Just, based off my experience, I think it's worth considering. 

With all that being said, it definitely sounds like he doesn't appreciate or respect you. It doesn't sound like he's treating you as your own person. More importantly, it doesn't sound like he thinks this is anything problematic or unusual.  And thats not okay from a life partner, regardless of the reason. 

My partner was diagnosed less than a year ago, and hes been very anxious to see a specialist and get on whatever medication can help. I admit that I am also eager for it. I admit that I would never consider marrying him or starting a family with him in his current state, and I see nothing wrong with this, with having my own standards and expectations. The difference for me is that I would never force him to take any medication (I would rather leave him). I would never impose my wishes upon him or demand that he change himself for me. I would definitely let him know what he needed to change in order for our relationship to work out, but I understand that he's still his own person and I would respect his own proper choice. 

However, it can be argued that, in a way, your boyfriend and I are saying the same things to our partners. ""If things can't be improved upon or fixed, and trying for a few days before falling back into the same problematic routines doesn't count, then this won't work out."" 

I won't be so presumptuous as to give you advice. I just related to your situation from another perspective and I hope it can help someone. Best of luck."

THAT BEING SAID, fuck this dude. If he treats you like this unmedicated he won't treat you much better no matter how many meds you take. It's one thing to be frustrated, or to encourage you to look at all your options to help you function, but it's a whole other thing to be a complete ass about it and hold your condition against you. If he can't handle you having ADHD, he should just leave, because it's who you are, not something to be cured. And if he CAN handle you having with ADHD, he should be advocating for you doing what's best to help you function and feel your best, not forcing you to do what he thinks will make his life easier.

>if he meets someone else that is ‚Äúmore stable‚Äù he will go ahead and take that route

This line sticks out as really important to me, because I think you should take him very seriously when he says that. I don't think it'll matter how stable you ever get, this'll always be his sentiment to keep you in line, OR he'll still leave for someone else.

I'd say I'm probably reaching way too far as an internet stranger, but considering that your friends who know the situation much better feel the same, I'm kinda confident in my assessment. Nothing will change. You'll never be good enough for him. He'll always say it's your fault. He will always keep you down and want you to do more to cater to him. My partner dated someone like this who took advantage of her being young and in her first relationship, and no matter how much she bent over backwards for him she was never good enough. This dude does not love you for who you are, he loves you for who you're willing to be for him. If you draw a boundary, he will not respect it. Kinda ranting here but seriously, he sucks.

TL;DR: Meds can be good, but get them on your own terms. You deserve better, there's someone out there that will respect you for who you are."

"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","I have 2 varying points

1.  Yes, i do think it's reasonable to ask you to try medication if the ADHD is causing you problems and problems in your relationship.  We can't expect others to be fine with bearing the brunt of our unpleasant behaviours because we're too stubborn to accept help for them.  If you're adhd behaviours are crossing someones boundaries they have every right to tell you that it's unacceptable for them.

2. If you are uncomfortable with their boundaries, you have every right to walk away also.  From what you have said this person is not very understanding about ADHD and the personality traits it entails.  Theres definitely a marked lack of compassion from them that's apparent in the way they spoke to you. There's a very real possibility that the personality traits they dislike so much are not going to melt away just because you're on medication. It seems like they aren't a good fit for you and you know it.  Don't let RSD keep you in a relationship that's shitty for you just because you don't want to go through the heightened emotional responses that ADHD causes.

I've had many a relationship fail because of my undiagnosed ADHD.  At the time I was very in denial that the things I was doing were definitely majorly irritating and overwhelming to deal with for someone who is neurotypical.  Our behaviour usually seems normal and excusable to us until it hits a peak where we start to find it difficult to deal with ourselves.  I've definitely been a pretty shitty person at times specifically because of my adhd and i now understand why I can't just expect other people to handle it and me all the time without checking me on it, and that if my adhd is a deal breaker for them I need to accept it and move on.

I know I'm probably going to get jumped on and downvoted for taking this stance, but I came to realize that taking my medication or not really affects everyone around me after dealing with a close friend with mental health problems who has difficulty complying to his medications.  When he's taking his meds he's a wonderful person who excels in life and is kind and caring.  When he stops talking them he's a nightmare to everyone around him and he sabotages any and all personal progress he makes.  A boundary i had to enforce with him is that if he's not taking his medication I can't talk to him.  It's not me trying to control him, it's a boundary i had to make because he has an explosive and unpredictable temper when he's not taking his meds and i can't allow myself to be put in that position.

Anyway, just another perspective to consider.  But i agree with everyone here that he's being unkind and unnecessarily hurtful.  There were definitely much better ways to breach talking to you about medication and relationship concerns and the way he did it was definitely a big red-flag."

Say like, would this be the same ""I love you but I need you to get treatment for depression or anxiety"" Would you react the same. This is difficult for me because being willing to work on your mental health is such a huge issue.   


At the end of the day, I feel it comes down to how they treat you, are you unhappy medicated? Does it ruin your life or cause some other issues? Do you feel like you don't need it? If any of those are yes then I'd say it's likely unreasonable to request you get medicated. Also Wellbutrin in my experience is just....not good at this for adults, but results vary."

Honestly, you should walk away now before you commit yourself and waste your time with a complete and total human garbage can.

Do you really even need to ask what you should do here? You know what to do, kick his ass to the curb. He‚Äôs already shown you just how little he thinks of you, so why waste another ounce of your time on his disgusting ass. You should only take meds if you want to, but if you don‚Äôt want to then that‚Äôs your choice - no loving & supportive partner would demand something so personal with such a vile attitude.

 It is another thing entirely for them to demand that you start taking meds immediately, Or that they will deny you a relationship.

The first reflects concern for your wellbeing and the relationship. The latter reflects a selfish demand that you fundamentally change something about yourself without time to prepare for it.

To be totally clear, meds have helped me and my gf, both of whom are diagnosed, in our relationship.  I'm sure that finding the right meds would help your relationships, among other things.  But the fact that your partner ""Would prefer you as a zombie,"" suggests that this is not a relationship you should help, but one you should leave.

As a side note if you do decide to get meds (for your own reasons,) tell your doctor which meds you were taking before and that they made you feel like a zombie sometimes. I felt that way at times when I took ritalin, but never once after switching meds, so I assume your doctor could see about perscribing you something less likely to prompt that side effect for you."

I made a similar demand of a now-former partner not too long ago. I asked that she either seek mental health treatment or move out. Her mental health had deteriorated to the point that she was making threats against the neighbor's kids and thought there was a conspiracy against her orchestrated by drivers of red and white trucks, among other paranoias and delusions. It was bad, and I was afraid to leave the house with her, and afraid to leave her alone. I had tried to get her family to go along with an intervention and they just wanted to stick their heads in the sand, even though severe mental illness run in the family. Eventually it just became too much for me to handle if I wanted to preserve my own mental health.

You aren't that. You're not hurting others around you. He needs to learn that you aren't going to have long conversations or remember every detail in the exact order that it happened.

A combination of finding someone that is patient and you actively doing your best to not drive them nuts can easily lead to a happy long term relationship with NT people.

If you're open and willing to comply with that, no worries, if not then it sounds as though there is a fundamental incompatibility between the two of you.

They get to decide what kind of people they are involved with and you get to decide whether you're okay with that."

sure it‚Äôs understandable to say in the beginning tht you (he/they) can take it on, then later be overwhelmed.. but the things he‚Äôs saying are NOT okay at all.

if he wants someone more stable, go find someone with a softer heart would be my advice and i‚Äôm speaking from experience.. he feels he can say those things cause you want him more than he wants you unfortunately. don‚Äôt EVER let ANYONE pressure you into meds as far as adhd/add goes and this is coming from someone who‚Äôs benefited greatly from meds.

HOW DARE he say he‚Äôd rather a zombie over you in your natural form. you deserve love with or without medication and there will always be someone out there who would die to have what he‚Äôs so willing to discard.

i‚Äôm so sorry you are going through this friend..

just a side note: i‚Äôve tried wellbutrin and it made me emotionless.. adderall is hard to come by, but it‚Äôs worked more than anything else has for me."

He‚Äôs not perfect (like me) and as an example earlier this week we argued about my forgetfulness. But ultimately he would never ever force me to take medication to alter my personality. I think someone has got to like you for who you are in the god and the bad for it to work out long term. My bf takes meds for his own issues (not add) and i don‚Äôt insist he take them or not, he takes them because he likes who he is on them better.

"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","My partner thinks that medication is a last resort. My ADHD symptoms are non existent at best and mild at worst. He's definitely gotten frustrated with me when I try to clarify my intentions before apologizing or answering the initial yes/no question. 

I have to keep my ADHD symptoms under control at all times, since medicine is a last resort for us, (He's explained he doesn't want a zombie gf, he wants me to be me) I do intense exercise regiments every other day. On my off days I have to stretch, do yoga, or cardio exercises. It's hard on me, but I do it. It takes care more than my ADHD symptoms, my Anxiety is near gone, and my body has been able to heal from extreme atrophy from my ED I had for 11 years.

This partner sounds like an asshole. I know mine sounds like an asshole too, but at least my partner isn't threatening the relationship or pushing me to do anything I'm not comfortable with in order to save the relationship. He's actually supporting me and helping me recover from my ED, perpetual Anxiety and all he asks is that I try to work on my ADHD on my own, so that way he doesn't have to worry about it. My partner wants me to be myself, unapologetically, and sees how proud I am when I can manage my symptoms of ADHD on my own without help. He's also going to be there if my symptoms worsen and says he'll help me figure out what I need to help me continue to manage on my own before we resort to meds. 

It doesn't sound like this partner is going to be supportive to you no matter what happens. You need to let this boy go. I say boy because a real man, who understands there's women with varying brains, who will be there for you when you need it most. You deserve better, OP.

DISCLAIMER!!!! I am aware everyone's ADHD is a different and unique experience and if meds are needed, please take them! This is only an account of my personal experience and I should also state that exercise doesn't work for everyone. It just happened to work for me."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","Speaking from experience‚Ä¶ This is most DEFINITELY emotional abuse and you deserve so much better and need to move on. 

Determine that you love yourself enough to not ever allow that level of disrespect again. 

There are so many things in this that jump out as red flags to me, but I have to be up at 5am for work, so I can‚Äôt really analyze each one of them right now and type it out in full detail. 

I will say, HE is likely the one gaslighting you about things and using your forgetfulness/poor memory as a scapegoat so that he can get away with it more easily. And the fact he expressed that he would go with someone else if he met then? Yikes! What an asshole. That‚Äôs not love and that‚Äôs not commitment. 

Yes, there are things we can do our best to improve upon or get help for with ADHD, but this dude sounds like he is trying to control you and deflect all blame for any and everything in the relationship onto you‚Ä¶that isn‚Äôt fair. Also, he sounds super insecure btw. 

Please know I‚Äôm coming from a place of genuine concern because my last relationship was like this and it was the first time in my life I had ever really experienced emotional & psychological abuse in a way that I was able to put the pieces together, do some research, & realize what was being done to me. I only stayed a couple of months after I‚Äôd fully realized what was happening and that everything was always going to be made to be my fault. I was a strong, happy, resilient person before that relationship. I had pretty much everything going for me. It all started rolling downhill after the ‚Äúhoneymoon phase‚Äù of a new relationship was over, the ‚Äúmask‚Äù fell off, and all of the verbal & emotional abuse began. I am now 2 years removed from it almost to the day, and I would be lying if I didn‚Äôt admit that there are still some pieces of my life I‚Äôm trying to pick up bc of how insidious and destructive psychological abuse is. I‚Äôm still not fully healed and while I have my good days, I still grieve the loss‚Äînot of the relationship, but of the person I was before I let someone who didn‚Äôt have good intentions & had toxic relationship habits come into my life like a wrecking ball and make me their next victim. There were so many things I loved about myself and lost as a result of that relationship that I‚Äôm still fighting hard to try and get back. Some days I‚Äôm doing well, but many days I‚Äôm still overwhelmed and exhausted by it all. Because it‚Äôs a daily fight trying to build that self-esteem back up. I wish I‚Äôd known what I know now and if I could have one do-over, I would‚Äôve RAN as fast as I could the minute my intuition started telling me something was off‚Äîthat it wasn‚Äôt real love. It was infatuation & manipulation on their part. This sounds like your intuition is telling you that the things he‚Äôs saying & demanding don‚Äôt feel right either OP‚Ä¶ I hope at the end of the day you can and do get out of this as unscathed as possible knowing you deserve better. Because you do. If you are googling or asking Reddit about hurtful things he‚Äôs saying and doing, let that be red flag #1. Once I researched psychological abuse & narcissism it was like a light flipped on and I saw exactly what my ex was doing‚Ä¶knowledge is power and there are great communities out there for people who have experienced this‚Ä¶it can feel very lonely and hard to go through bc it‚Äôs so difficult to explain it to anyone who‚Äôs not been through it. 

I wish you the best and that you‚Äôd know YOU ARE ENOUGH and you are worthy AS YOU ARE. It doesn‚Äôt mean we don‚Äôt all have room to grow. But don‚Äôt let some turd emotional vampire of a shitty boyfriend dictate your value to you, or demand such things out of you in return for his basic loyalty.

Let‚Äôs be honest here, if we have people around us who enable our behaviors, let things slide and don‚Äôt hold us accountable for our actions, we will not progress in life and become the best version of ourselves we can be. 

While ‚Äúforcing medications‚Äù can seem like someone is saying you‚Äôre not good enough, I don‚Äôt see it that way as someone who is ADHD. I really struggle certain days to get things done and stay on top of things and I‚Äôm my own worst enemy. Like others say, medication is a tool. Not a cure. 

I force myself to get. Shit. Done. To be more present. To not drift off and be VERY aware of my behaviors and when I‚Äôm drifting or not being productive, but that is just me. 

Threats and making you feel bad is not cool. What he said to you is really shitty and he sounds very frustrated and lacking of respect. A relationship can‚Äôt survive without respect. It just won‚Äôt woRK, Adhd or not. 

Trust your gut if you feel alarm bells. They are there to serve you for a reason. Go on meds for you, not for someone else. Meds come with lots of side effects. It can make ADHD worse, mess with your emotions if you‚Äôre not on the right dose, etc.

Thoughts?","First off, what‚Äôs ‚Äúmore stable?‚Äù No one is ‚Äúmore stable‚Äù. ADHD makes us who we are. Everyone has something. Maybe impulsiveness and anxiety we can work on. But in my opinion if your partner puts you don‚Äôt like that, time to move on. 

My husband told me I need to get my impulsiveness in control but to be honest I was out of control with money. At some point I went out and bought a car without giving him warning. I just came home with a new car. The hyperness, restlessness and all the other things he‚Äôs very understanding with but the going crazy on buying whatever, wasn‚Äôt good and I agreed with him. I did cognitive behavioral therapy. It‚Äôs helped so much; I have a very nice savings now! It‚Äôs been 13 years of hard work but I feel more in control.

But if your partner thinks meds will fix hyperness, forgetfulness and some of the other characteristics of ADHD, meds won‚Äôt cure that. It might fit a few hours. It helps me at work keep focus when I have no motivation to do something.

I‚Äôm against putting others down like that. Time to move on."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","He didn‚Äôt have the full information in the beginning. He has every right to expect you to work to solve your problems. ADHD is not an excuse for your behavior. You can‚Äôt just say I know I don‚Äôt listen to you, but I‚Äôm ADHD, so you should just be understanding. He is telling you what he wants in a relationship so listen. If you think you‚Äôre fine the way you‚Äôre and want a partner that just accepts that, then break up with him, and find someone who is fine with the way you behave in a relationship.

The way you describe him makes him sound like a bit of an asshole, so I would be hesitant to say you‚Äôre the only one at fault, but you guys need to work together and come to a compromise. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair for him to tell you, you have to be on medication. Explain to him that ADHD is not curable and medication is not the only way to treat it. It doesn‚Äôt work for everyone. If you‚Äôre not willing to at least try to improve it though, you‚Äôre at fault.  If you don‚Äôt want to go on medication, then you need to start seeing a counselor for it, and maybe see a couples counselor who is experienced in ADHD, so they understand where you‚Äôre coming from.

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs acceptable for him to say he‚Äôll leave you for someone more stable. If that‚Äôs the case, then he will leave you for someone else even if you‚Äôre putting in effort to work on it. I would be worried that he is already cheating on you if he believes that fixable issues are an excuse to dump someone. He may have just said it in anger though since it doesn‚Äôt seem like you‚Äôre willing to change. 

Even if you‚Äôre capable of adapting on your own, going to counseling or going on medication shows him that you‚Äôre putting in the effort. He can‚Äôt see what‚Äôs going on in your head, all he sees are the results. He‚Äôs seeing you still not listening after numerous talks, he‚Äôs seeing you still not doing chores that he‚Äôs discussed with you. He‚Äôs not seeing you doing your best to get better. 

Living with someone with ADHD is hard. I have ADHD and know what it‚Äôs like and I still struggle with my partner who has it because I ask him repeatedly to do things, and he says he‚Äôs going to and then never does. He knows how frustrated and angry it makes me when he doesn‚Äôt listen to me, and he keeps doing it. This says to me that my feelings don‚Äôt matter. He only starts to put in effort when we have a huge blow up and then he works really hard to be better for three days and then stops and goes right back to what he was doing. Like you, he has not sought counseling, and he has not tried medication. I, on the other hand, take adderall and it makes me a lot easier to live with. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair that I‚Äôm the only one putting in effort, so I‚Äôve discussed going to counseling or getting treatment with him, and I‚Äôve offered to help pay for it. If he‚Äôs not willing to meet you halfway and wants to blame everything on you though, I would end the relationship. That‚Äôs not healthy, and if you accept that now, you will always be the one having to change your behaviors to suit his needs, and he will never do the same for you."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","About two years ago, my marriage was suffering greatly due to a bunch of changes in my life that not only brought my ADHD into my awareness, but made life pretty tough for my partner.

I've heard ADHD experts refer to ADHD as the ""diabetes of mental health disorders"". This is because of how unaware we can be of our own state precisely because our neurotransmitters don't allow us to see it.

Now, I am not saying that your partner is right to give you an ultimatum, nor that it's fair. But life isn't always fair and saying ""end the relationship"" is a catchall for any unfairness in descriptions on the internet. What I am saying is that his struggle is also real. It's *not your fault*, but it is *your responsibility* to take care of yourself and be present for your partner.

My partner also has anger issues and likes things a certain way. This has been super tough on me, but only because I hadn't yet treated my ADHD. We saw a couple's therapist who specializes in ADHD. This was super important for my husband to stop blaming and start understanding how my mind works. Then I got officially diagnosed and got on meds. 

In my experience, the medication is a game changer. Frankly, if your partner is struggling like mine was, he is right to suggest (not force) that you try it. My brain fog has greatly dissipated. I'm way more self-aware and present. I don't forget things as much, and my time blindness is much less severe. I regulate my emotions better and feel way less drained at the end of the day. How could a partner not want all of those for the person they love?

If he's in crisis mode and considering ending the relationship, this can *explain* (not excuse) his insistence. And when dealing with someone who cannot read the label on the jar from the inside, it can be understandably frustrating. 

My advice? See a therapist. Try the meds. Tell your partner what you need from him to succeed together. He may not have gone about this the right way, but if we give him the benefit of the doubt that his intentions are ultimately good, focus on the root issues and discuss the approach afterward.

Edit: reread your post and yeah some of his comments and definitely hurtful. EVEN if he perceives you as less emotionally stable, you don't say that to someone!! Only you can know if he's mistreating you out of cruelty or is lashing out because of his own struggling to cope with the relationship."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner.

Being manipulative, treating you like dirt, forcing ultimatums upon you and comparing you to other girls / options is another.
My partner has followed me through my ups and downs of being diagnosed, supported, medded etc. And whilst she flips out now if I want to skip it one day; that‚Äôs as far as she goes. She doesn‚Äôt bring hell down upon me daily for having my own thoughts and opinions of certain subjects. 
This guy is a dick; and is only exacerbating your issues more.
Either stand your ground and make him listen or bin him off. No one deserves these types of comments."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner.

Love is meant to be unconditional and this sounds like your partner is putting conditions on your love to fit his own needs. 
Don't ever let anybody make you feel worthless. You are a beautiful human being and if he is putting conditions on your love then your partner doesn't love you. Never settle and never allow people to make you feel like shit. You are a star seed and shine bright. 
Good luck and wishing you all the best."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","Here's the thing... He's putting an ultimatum on something you already plan on doing. This is not a healthy, supporting relationship. This is control at best and abuse at worst. If you are truly everything they want, then they should be accepting you as you are and helping you get better with support. Not threats. 

The other thing here is that on the surface this might seem ""OK"" because you're getting medication anyways. But if they put an ultimatum on this, then it will only be a matter of time before they issue another one for a different issue. It will go on until you finally cannot meet the requirement of one and they follow through with the threat of leaving you. 

It is not healthy."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","You say you feel like a failure. There are a lot of red flags and things to point out concerning your SO in the post, but I kind of wanted to focus on this. Firstly, your partner is expecting meds to fix you or change you to be more acceptable to their standards. OP, you can find someone who loves you for you, flaws, ADHD, everything. And it‚Äôll feel so much better. ADHD can cause discourse but it seems like your current SO is imagining you as you, but w/o adhd. Meds will not erase your ADHD. That said, I do strongly recommend meds, not for your bf, but for yourself. They helped me a ton, but they‚Äôre a hassle to get so I take them very sparingly.

&nbsp;

Back to my main point: no healthy relationship should leave you feeling like a failure. I‚Äôm sure you know this isn‚Äôt healthy, only you‚Äôre blaming yourself for having adhd. Your partner is going to expect your meds to be a cure, and they won‚Äôt be. He also admits to you that he‚Äôd leave you if someone ‚Äúmore stable‚Äù came along. OP, I‚Äôve been in your shoes and didn‚Äôt leave and it left me with years of stress, trauma, and time spent solely on someone else while wasting my own time- because I was just fully encompassed by the stress of the relationship and constant fear that I‚Äôd do something to set him off or lose him. For years he hid our relationship and flirted with other girls, even may have actually cheated on me. Because he liked the comfort of having someone always there, but wanted something else. If I could go back and was in your situation I‚Äôd make the step to break up. He‚Äôs admitted that he‚Äôs just waiting for someone else to come along. It‚Äôs one thing to discuss possible positive changes with a partner, and another thing to talk to them and treat them the way he does you. Leave him."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","Yeah, I'm sorry, but I don't think he fully understands ADHD and that you might be at an impasse. Have the two of you talked about couples counseling? A skilled therapist could help you two come to an understanding. Because I'm wondering if what he's saying is a result of built up and unexpressed frustration and resentment. 

The meds may help with what he's asking about, but it's not a magical cure all, which is why I think therapy would help you two."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?",I would get the meds and ditch the dude. Meds aren't magic and he clearly does not accept you as you are.

"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","So I get both sides‚Ä¶I had a boyfriend once to whom I gave an ultimatum- take antidepressants or I‚Äôm done.  I just couldn‚Äôt deal with him Unmedicated, it was making me feel crazy.

That being said; some of his stuff is just mean. And that‚Äôs not ok. He also doesn‚Äôt appear to be wanting you to take meds to help YOU, but it may be that you aren‚Äôt hearing that?  It is one thing to be supportive of someone‚Äôs dx when everything is new and the daily frustrations are possibilities not realities.

I have huge issues with my son(dx not medicated) lying and forgetting to get stuff done, I love him but I have to take some pretty deep breaths sometimes!

On another note from a medical condition that‚Äôs not ADHD‚Ä¶my husband is losing his hearing. He wears hearing aides mostly and it helps but obviously does not cure. They bother him so in weekends he often doesn‚Äôt wear them. He gets upset if I speak to him from another room, because ‚Äúyou know I can‚Äôt hear you‚Äù or if I don‚Äôt answer from another room because I do know that and it takes me a bit to get to him. (Now I‚Äôm ignoring him) also if I ‚Äúmutter‚Äù (anything he can‚Äôt understand) or conversely ‚Äúyell‚Äù anytime I raise my voice on the second or third repetition.  It often frustrates me, that he will wear the damn hearing aides for work but not for ME. And makes me feel unimportant. But what it is, is I‚Äôm safe! And that‚Äôs a good thing.

So definitely try meds, but don‚Äôt let him bully you about it. Explore why he is reacting the way he is‚Ä¶ and how you are responding‚Ä¶ it might be that he isn‚Äôt your safe person.  But recognize that dealing with a disability is a challenge for everyone not just the individual with the dx."

The biggest being on communication, particularly when we‚Äôre both upset. I just can‚Äôt keep up and then it ends up being construed as ‚Äúgaslighting‚Äù because I have missed the point or am saying something different. 

We are still working on this, often. We‚Äôve learned that it‚Äôs just night and day with how we think and present. We‚Äôve found that indirect means of communicating if something is wrong (mood board, also we made a literal ‚Äúform‚Äù in case we are in an argument). The form has been really helpful, because we agreed on questions to address, it gives us time to calm down, and because we made it together, we get some collaboration back. It‚Äôs a last resort, but it was very insightful for understanding how we process things so differently.

Your partner is being a D I C K. It is absolutely fair for him to want you to take care of yourself, and his concerns are ofc valid. But you were transparent, and you are trying! He‚Äôs ignoring that and blaming you for things that you quite literally cannot help. Our brains are borked. 

Navigating ADHD in relationships is teamwork, it can‚Äôt be all on you. That‚Äôs not fair, and I really hope he gets some perspective very quick. Good luck to you, and I hope you‚Äôre able to remember that you are not the problem here. You‚Äôre amazing, and you are doing all the right things."

Next time he says something like that, make him stick to it and watch the tide change. He's probably saying it as a control tactic, a bargaining chip that anyone who cares about your feelings would know is wrong and hurtful. Either he cares and stops using this to get you to show him how badly your want to be with him or he proves to you that he's been fake loving you and it's time to move on.

But this is some nasty stuff, I don't know if I'd give him the chance to change unless it was a long relationship full of mostly non-abusive behavior"

my situation is a bit different since my bf is the one who's adamant about us staying together, while i, on the other hand, absolutely will NOT settle for someone who doesn't totally accept me and totally understand me. i don't feel like i should have to/ need to change, yes i need to work on getting better at a *lot* of things but i will NOT allow myself to end up with someone who requires me to change who i am.

the experience i got from all my many failed relationships allowed me to gain complete clarity and certainty regarding what i want and need from a partner. it doesn't sound like you've quite gotten to this point but i'm sure you will and hopefully you'll come to the same conclusion.

as a side note: i do *not* plan to marry my current bf due to the above. (and for the record, i've talked to him about this multiple times and he absolutely knows my position so i'm not an ass just leading him on)."

There are so many people out there that will understand you have flaws just like everyone else and not mind your particular ADHD related issues.

I speak from experience - I got married in April. He loves and supports me even when I don't listen to everything he says the first time and ask him to repeat himself often. We are compatible so the way I am isn't ultimately an issue for him.

HOWEVER all the examples you gave are red flags that make it sound like he is impossible to please; since I assume you are making an effort. 

All relationships require some compassion and good communication, and long term relationships also require commitment to weather the ups and downs. He has advertised he has no commitment. 

The difference in memory problem is suspicious; I might suggest writing things down as they happen objectively since it sounds he has a habit of denying your point of view. Basically if you leave you have evidence of what you were saying that he can‚Äôt deny. 

Not a good relationship. Sadly. As others were saying, these problems might improve but won‚Äôt go away with medication."

"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","I think the way the partner is approaching this is absolutely a huge red flag and probably a sign to go separate ways. 

However, I would strongly advise the OP to look into getting on medication regardless. Finding the correct medication and dosage that works for you is such a major quality of life improvement. I thought meds made me a zombie too and went off them for a long time. Got back on a smaller extended release dosage and it was like I had a second chance at life."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","Agreed. 

 I‚Äôm a woman in my 30s married to another woman. My spouse seems like an untenable partner on paper for someone with ADHD because she happens to be very particular about things.With that said, she has a patient heart and will forgive my less than perfect ways if I commit to tasks I *can* do, like the dishes and making dinner every night (I work from home). Because she hates doing those things and genuinely enjoys other chores, it works out nicely.

 I find my flexibility is an asset to her structured ways and visa versa. For all my faults, I will still go out of my way to compromise. And because I‚Äôm so willing to compromise, she is more willing to forgive me if I‚Äôm not the cleanest person 24/7.

These dynamics vary between couple to couple, but as long as you can meet a baseline level of functionality (for me, medication is necessary), you don‚Äôt have to be perfect. I‚Äôve actually seen NT relationships fail because both partners are too rigid despite being abnormally on top of things. What good is a pristine house and never forgetting appointment times if you spend 24/7 bickering over what to have for dinner or what to watch on tv? 

The openness that often accompanies ADHD can be an asset in relationships, I think. The trick is getting to a baseline level of day to day togetherness, however, and that might not happen OP if you don‚Äôt at least try to treat your ADHD, whether that‚Äôs through medication (maybe a different drug or dose than before?) or therapy etc. If your boyfriend isn‚Äôt flexible enough to meet you half way, then there‚Äôs your answer. But he can‚Äôt meet you half way if you aren‚Äôt addressing your issues."

"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","Echoing this. Medication plus executive functioning coaching helps but there is always the neurological basis that will be present. Your partner needs to be a person who is able to surf those waves of imperfection. Honestly, your partner is exhibiting some very controlling behavior regardless of adhd or not. All humans have error and weakness. To always be ready to jump ship for the next best thing is a sign of utter disloyalty and pure selfishness. This person is not ready for a relationship much less the mature type that comes with physical struggle. What if you stay together and, God forbid, you develop cancer? Will he be up to the challenge of caretaking and supporting then when the relative ease of adhd was too much? I understand being irritated by the idiosyncrasies of adhd. It took several months of couples therapy for my husband to understand I wasn‚Äôt purposefully sabotaging events and choosing lateness to spite him. Time blindness is real! Having a third party profession explain the adhd brain was a massive turn in his softening to my struggles..  He became so much more patient. If your partner is unwilling to see that this is more than medication and continues to be harmful to your psychological well-being (which this behavior definitely is), it‚Äôs time to say your goodbyes."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","Agreed.

I also realized most likely he's depressed because of his environment (he lives with his parents and they aren't always very nice to him) and because I'm not always the most stable person in the world (I'm bipolar)"
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","This being true doesn't take away from meds helping in a temporary situation until certain behaviors are better controlled.  

I am that guy.  My gf possibly as cptsd and myriad of other things.  Its still early days to tell but the reality was she was a live wire to triggers and trapped in her head reliving traumas.  Before I gave an ultimatum of ""getting professional help or im out(which they immediately gave her meds)"" I couldn't speak.  I couldnt act outside what she had ""predicted"" I would want or do.  It was beyond toxic and it wasnt really her fault but it was her responsibility to handle.  She couldn't and nothing I was doing was helping.  I was making it worse.  

1 week into meds and we still have moments but o m g.  The difference.  I have heard her laugh.  I have seen her cry.  I have seen her.  Its a wonderful mix of emotions and I wish I had pulled the trigger earlier but I really didn't want to be ""that guy"".

My point is, he suggesting meds.  What really needs to happen is you getting help from someone who knows how to help.  Meds might be involved but if your behaviors, regardless of reasons, are toxic to him then it needs to be worked on.  That or you have to walk away.  

You don't have to change yourself.  You owe nothing to anyone but yourself and your children.  Do what you want and need.  Do you."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?",ADHD is part of me. I love it and I hate it.  It's enabled me to see things other people don't see.  I mean it's like trying to cure someone with Autism or Asperger's or Bipolar Disorder.  There is no cure and to cure you then *you* would no longer exist.
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","Yes! Medicine does not eliminate adhd, and it sounds like he isn't invested in your relationship if he's ready to move on if you don't get medicine. 

I am nt (Idk maybe autistic, but whatever) and my husband is adhd, and we were married for 6 years (relationship for 9) before he was on ADHD medicine. We had to create ways to make things work before ADHD or medicine even crossed our minds. Sometimes that meant space to let him info dump and I just listen, sometimes that meant letting some of my standards for chores go down, sometimes it was a conversation saying ""hey I really need you to be able to do this, how can we support you doing this,"" and sometimes it was him explaining what he went thru when I expected too much. We have very open communication about our needs (which also evolve over time and circumstances).

This dude sounds like even when you get on medicine, he'll find something else to blame you for so he can manipulate you into doing what he wants you to do. ""If I can find someone else faster"" is a big red flag.

I hope you do what makes you happy and safe. Feel free to dm me if talking to a stranger over dms can help."

Before anyone claps back at me about the specific struggles of ADHD and why the alleviation is so hard, please know that I have ADHD. The partner I am thinking of when I say this had anger management issues. He refused to do any work for it - no therapy, no classes that he decided to do and paid for, no yoga which was also fully his idea. (I was a supporter of therapy but he was not comfortable with that, but he also didn‚Äôt do the things he decided he needed to do to help with his anger management.) 

It sucked so much. I see anger as a struggle just as much as ADHD. But I am (and was) actually taking steps to try and minimize how it would negatively affect him. It still did of course - my ADHD will always affect those around me, as much as I desperately wish it wouldn‚Äôt.

I found my wife pretty quickly after my ex left me, and she accepted me wholly and completely. In fact, she doesn‚Äôt like me on my meds because, in her words, ‚ÄúI prefer having all of you because I love you for you. The more you I can get the better.‚Äù

You are constantly asking yourself ‚Äúare they being an asshole or is it ADHD?‚Äù All of those small things are usually things that matter to the other partner. For me it took a lot of time to internalize and understand that these are not specific slights against me. He doesn‚Äôt forget because I‚Äôm not important, etc. 

The reason it works is because 1) he‚Äôs my best friend and we just love to be together. 2) we spend a lot of time talking about how we view situations and trying to improve communication 3) he puts effort into learning how to live with ADHD. He sees a coach and a therapist and is on medication. 

The only times I‚Äôve contemplated not being with him is when he put zero effort into living with adhd and wanted me to pick up ALL the slack. I don‚Äôt need him to remember everything or change who he is. Just put effort into learning how to live in today‚Äôs world with ADHD. With being the breadwinner, having kids, house and him having a demanding job it‚Äôs just too hard to manage with untreated ADHD. I don‚Äôt want to change him, I just want him to learn how to thrive vs trying to pass as nuerotypical. He needs support from people outside of me (coach and therapist) though and for him medication is key.

------------------------------------------------

**Firstly, is it reasonable to tell a partner that they will end the relationship if they do not take regularly prescribed medicine?** 

I say to this, yes it is reasonable. Living with a partner with mental health issues of any kind puts a great deal of weight on a person - moreover they are rarely the subject of support in that situation. Friends and family of the couple will often lean towards the menatally ill partner in arguments due to the nature of the conditions they have, whilst the partner of such a person will enjoy relatively fewer moments of support. Society at large, at least the most accessible online components of society, will also come down in support of the mentally ill partner. Similar examples can be seen in the coming out of trans or LGBTQ+ individuals (Not that they are mentally ill) who are in long-term relationships, such as Philip Schofield, whilst coming out is good ofcourse - society rarely considers the damage done to the partners of these people, time is finite after all and now they've spent a considerable amount of time with someone who could never have loved them as someone should have.  

Finally, the mentally ill partner themselves can often be incapable of supporting them due to the condition and so this individual must live in a relationship defined by the needs of the ill partner, the needs of partners to them are less likely to be met and the relationship which ideally should be a place of mental and spiritual reprieve then evolves into a cause of mental and spiritual harm. Unlike with LGBTQ+ people, those in our situation or other mental health related issues can take medicines to stabilise ourselves and live more productive lives. The act of doing so makes the lives of those around us easier and partners are aware of that, they therefore have every right to ask that someone takes the medicine, even by ultimatum. After all, if your issues can be improved with medicines and you refuse to take them - then you are outsourcing your pain to your partner and doing so in a preventable way. So the act of refusing to medicate becomes inherently a harmful act to the partner. Thus, it is reasonable. 

**Secondly, is this person someone whom is worth staying with and taking the medicine?** 

Absolutely not, several red flags exist in this relationship. Whilst a long period dealing with ADHD partners may indeed make someone frustrated and more irritable, it doesn't justify the scale to which he has taken it. Unless he's under some other horrific stress at the time, the things he has done are not forgivable. For me, saying that he would leave you so easily or prefer you in a zombie like state, these are really very unethical. In particular the fact he'd leave you. If OP refuses to take the prescribed medicine then the partner has good reason to be upset, but the way he's dealing with it is so bad that I can't see any reason to keep the relationship going. At this point he is either a bad human being or the stress of a atypical relationship has pushed him so far that I can't see a way back to normalcy."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","I totally disagree, the bf has needs too. He needs to feel supported, loved and protected too, not just OP. It‚Äôs not wrong to say that he would prefer to be in a relationship with somebody more stable, who wouldn‚Äôt want that?! 

We should know better than anybody that we are NOT easy people to be with, why is it wrong for OPs partner to express that it‚Äôs hard for him? Maybe we should learn to listen when somebody who loves us tells us that they are struggling in the relationship. 

It‚Äôs not fair that we should expect our partners to bend for us if we are not willing to bend for them."

You deserve to be happy and happy as yourself."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","Yes came here to say exactly that about using her adhd as a weapon. So much projection.

I dated someone who did that and it was cruel and always had me doubting myself. Which of course I later learned was what he wanted. He‚Äôd call me useless, a shell of a person, an autistic child. Always telling me I wasn‚Äôt functioning correctly.

Would give ultimatums like OPs boyfriend. Worst of all, told me that allowing myself to be so useless and letting others treat me badly was me being abusive toward my loved ones. The mental gymnastics he pulled with that one!

It‚Äôs okay to get frustrated. It‚Äôs okay for both sides to be convinced their memory is correct. What‚Äôs not okay is making the other person feel worthless for their failings and refusing to help them be stronger."

Because, right now, he's in a relationship with someone who accepts him at his word when he says that she's ""misremembering"" something. His version of events is always taken as the more factually accurate one because he can use OP's ADHD as a justification for assuming that she's the one who can't remember what happened. 

He's not any less likely to get into an argument with a ""more stable"" partner because they both remember an event differently. He's just less likely to convince that partner that his version of events is 100% objectively correct. I mean, given that he does this in the first place, he clearly thinks that manipulating his partner's memories is appropriate, so why would he switch out for a partner where he's less likely to succeed at doing that?

Nah, this is an empty threat. Just another method of controlling OP. It's fucked up."

"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","Agreed. The amount of people in this thread saying he should just accept her the way she is, is disturbing. He should not have to settle for less than he wants out of a relationship just because she has a mental disorder. It‚Äôs not curable, but it is manageable, and she is not managing hers. 

It sounds like he‚Äôs being an asshole, but we‚Äôre only heading one side of the story. Ultimatums aren‚Äôt good, but if OP isn‚Äôt comfortable going on ADHD meds, she needs to seek other treatment options and communicate that to him. If he still says meds or nothing, then she needs to leave. ADHD is not an excuse for shitty behavior. Feeling like your partner doesn‚Äôt listen or care about your feelings is terrible. I think the biggest red flag would be saying he would leave her for someone else. That wasn‚Äôt appropriate, but it sounds like this has been building for a while and was likely said out of built up anger and frustration. She definitely needs to tell him that, that is unacceptable and that if he really feels that way, the relationship needs to end. He has every right to expect her to work on herself though, and she has every right to expect the same from him. If either partner thinks they‚Äôre perfect the way they‚Äôre and the other partner should just accept all their flaws, than they need to end the relationship. They‚Äôre also not likely to have a successful relationship if they feel that way. 

ADHD is not an excuse. It just means you have to work harder than other people. It sucks, it isn‚Äôt your fault you have it, but if you think other people should have to just accept you the way you‚Äôre while you constantly hurt their feelings not listening to them, then you‚Äôre the problem."

"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","So glad to see this. It really worries me that so many people with adhd will immediately say oh he's abusive, he's a narcissist, because this is a really common issue in a partnership. Like it or not ADHD works against basically everything people are socialized to expect from a relationship. Like it or not many with ADHD do not realize how severely it is showing up in their life. They don't remember how many times the partner complained about the same thing, how many broken promises have been made, how many times impulsivity made them ignore boundaries or behave disrespectfully. 

And my gosh rejection sensitivity can be a beast to feel, but it can also make the person feeling it behave abusively to the person that they feel rejected by. It makes us have tantrums basically. Not a good look. We are responsible for being destructive to ourselves and others. 

I have ADHD and so does my husband but his is more severe on most symptoms. I understand where stuff comes from but it can't be an excuse or we are being bad partners. 

Something I have learned in support groups for people with people who have ADHD is that one of the clearest signs the ADHD is not managed well enough is the person without ADHD or with less severe ADHD seems like they have anger problems and the person with ADHD or more severe ADHD feels like the other person is always trying to control them. 

Managing it doesn't have to mean meds. Kudos to those that have found partners that do not expect them to manage their condition. I believe that either those people's ADHD does not show up as destructively, or they are not so defensive when an issue is raised so the relationship can stay healthy. I accept that my partner has ADHD and I am patient with a lot of what that looks like but I still expect him to work at being a good partner. I literally just demanded that my husband get therapy because his RSD shows up as emotional abuse and I can't take it anymore. Apparently around here that makes me a narcissist. ü§∑"

His behavior was not okay but I do think we have some responsibility to try to manage the symptoms that negatively affect our partners (or anyone else we care about). Things like poor listening and disorganization can put serious strain on a relationship. It's not fair to demand that someone take medication but there are other ways to mitigate ADHD symptoms and putting in some kind of effort (which OP did!) is important. It's not our fault we have ADHD but it is our responsibility to deal with it in whatever way works for us."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","I appreciate you bringing the nuance to the discussion. 

My husband and I are both diagnosed and medicated. Lately we‚Äôve been having a really difficult time and I think a lot of it is that his medications aren‚Äôt working well. They help enough so that he can work; but he‚Äôs severely checked out emotionally and with family responsibilities. We‚Äôve been together over 15 years and have 2 young kids together. I do love him and the man he is inside, but some of the ways that he acts are low-key abusive and neglectful. 

I‚Äôve considered leaving him or a trial separation (partially in an attempt of ‚Äúmaybe if I‚Äôm not there to carry him he‚Äôll finally realize himself how bad it is and seek appropriate care,‚Äù but as I am writing this right now I do not actually think that would happen. He‚Äôd just blame me and stay stuck.) I‚Äôve suggested changing up meds but I can‚Äôt solve this for him. He does have a psychiatrist and is in counseling but he hasn‚Äôt changed much in over a year. 

Anyhow, all that to say - ADHD is really ruining our marriage. Deep down we are highly compatible and make a great team. But lately almost every situation becomes a disagreement. He wasn‚Äôt this way a decade ago. And I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ‚Äúhim‚Äù that I want to change - but more how these symptoms are destroying our ability to connect and function."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner.

Then I read her post...

He's yelling at her for not following a conversation, he's told her he's gonna leave her once he finds someone better, she was getting meds, but it wasn't soon enough.

All this anger, impatience and cruelty are signs of abuse. The biggest problem I see in regards of her ADHD is her rejection sensitivity has her putting up with this shit and trying to appease this man instead of leaving. 

While it's true our ADHD can make relationships harder for us, it's also true that sometimes people are just in relationships with abusers. And if he didn't have her ADHD to blame, he'd blame something else. Her size, her looks, her attitude, her friends. A man like that will always find something to grind a woman down about."

People don't stay in a relationship while telling their partner they would prefer to be with someone else, or that they would like them better if they felt like a zombie but were more convenient to them. Actually, people don't just lash out.

I grew up with emotionally immature people who did lash out, and berate each other over perceived flaws, and it made me think people just were that way. It also made me feel like I'm the sum of my flaws, to this day even. It took into my 20s to realize that people were actually, more often, way kinder and less scornful than what I thought was normal.

People are focusing on his behavior because it is *immediately* alarming, and OP may not realize it's actually not normal."

(Or maybe I‚Äôm projecting based on a similar experience I‚Äôm in! Haha)"
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","While your insight and explanation is totally reasonable, the problem with OPs partner is that he is gaslighting her, and forcing an ultimatum on her. He's allowed to struggle with all the things she does differently than him. What isn't okay is the way he's trying to ""fix"" her in order to make life easier for himself. She's already trying to find a doctor to prescribe her medication, and she's trying to deal with her issues, and yet the boyfriend is just shaming her over and over again. That is not what a good partner is. He cannot say he loves her and then in the same breath tell her he's *this* close to leaving her. That's manipulative and emotionally abusive."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","Agreed! But In this situation he is being emotionally abusive and using her ADJD as a weapon.

She wasn‚Äôt even trying to throw him under the bus. She was listing off the things he complained about. And quite frankly these things happen it relationships with people that don‚Äôt have ADHD. Forgetting specific details, drifting off during a conversation, whoops forgot to empty the dishwasher. 

And then let‚Äôs-not forget he told her if he found somebody more stable he‚Äôd go with them. This is manipulative he‚Äôs gaslighting her (I don‚Äôt throw that term around lightly) to make her feel like she‚Äôs worse off then she is and it‚Äôs only going to get worse. He is abusive.

ETA Yes! People need to advocate and be responsible for their own mental health"
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?",I‚Äôm fairly certain a similar conversation led to me seeking medical intervention for myself but I did in turn ask him to address an issue of issue that I felt needed more attention.  We‚Äôre not part of their relationship while some horrible things were said I worry that the parties in hear responsed with more emotionality than needed. This could be a great time to re-evaluate your role in the problems while making him address his problems. Trust me it will be the best choice for you. Being medicated was the difference between success in my field or not.
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","A relationship is a partnership, although op might be being a bad partner due to the ADHD her boyfriend is being a bad partner without it.

Your story shows how you relate to op, how your boyfriend gave you the same ultimatum  and how you worked it out. Did your boyfriend also say that he would leave if someone stable came along, or that he would prefer you as a zombie?!?

Another difference is you didn't tell you boyfriend whereas ops boyfriend knew before and apparently excepted it! I do get how living with ADHD is difficult and he may not have been as prepared as he thought but it doesn't excuse his manipulation and disregard for op and her feelings."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","Also the fact that you're wording it as anything close to the phrase ""aggression triggers"" is downright scary. Even if that never translates to actually physically harming you.

Run run run run run"
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?",That's not what gaslighting means...
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","She's not refusing to take any steps. She is working on it. He is not willing to work on anything. Also, he is the gaslighter. If he cannot cope, he should leave. If he wants someone ""more stable"" as he has stated, why doesn't he leave as threatened and go find someone ""more stable""? Stop normalizing abuse."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?",I‚Äôm not against taking meds. Just scared they won‚Äôt do the work he expects. I was just prescribed Wellbutrin! So I hope it makes things better.
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?",She said the opposite though. He‚Äôs not the one willing to work it out. He‚Äôs stubborn about her using medicine and will not listen to reason
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","It's truly concerning that you say the inconveniences are escalating into aggression. The examples you gave of what he takes issue with are truly small inconveniences not worth getting aggressive over. I strongly suspect if the relationship continues, his behaviour will escalate and he will always find something to blame you for no matter how hard you try. 
This is not your fault. There are other people out there who will be patient with you in relationships. Always keep an eye out for red flags of abuse!"
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","I really appreciate your comment. I‚Äôm in a situation that is real applicable. Husband and I both have (treated) ADHD but we really struggle with communication. We both get so hurt by things the other does and it is difficult for us to process them together and move past them. I also feel like his symptoms have gotten worse over the last few years and it feels like how you describe your ex. His mental health issues are severe and I can‚Äôt fix them. And I have my own major health issues that I‚Äôm currently working on so I can‚Äôt do all the leg work for him (as I‚Äôve done in the past). I love him, but I‚Äôm exhausted. I don‚Äôt want to leave him (and we have 2 young kids together) but it‚Äôs hard enough trying to heal myself, take care of my own adult responsibilities, and raise my kids, I just cannot add ‚Äútake care of his adult responsibilities‚Äù and ‚Äúfix his mental health.‚Äù 

And he does try to make things better‚Ä¶ often times it‚Äôs in the wrong ways (which then makes things worse because he put in effort but it doesn‚Äôt actually change anything). I try to be appreciative but sometimes it feels like he wants to be showered with appreciation for doing a basic adult thing (when he doesn‚Äôt appreciate what I do for him). I digress‚Ä¶

> if we need more than they can give, we have to accept this and end things without blame and abuse. It‚Äôs not fair to constantly guilt someone who is already having a rough time. 

^ I‚Äôm going to process through how this applies to my relationship. You‚Äôve given me a lot of food for thought - thank you."

"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","This is a tangent to this discussion, but I‚Äôm interested in your take because we have similar family situations. My father was undiagnosed ADHD when I was growing up (he was diagnosed when I left for college). Sister and I both have ADHD. And my partner is ADHD. 

My issue is that a lot of my father‚Äôs undiagnosed severe symptoms became abusive or neglectful towards his family. We didn‚Äôt know about ADHD in the 90s and mental health support was not even something we were aware of. (As a teen, I just thought he was a giant asshole who couldn‚Äôt control himself.) Needless to say, there was constant turmoil and tension in our family because of him and his disruptive symptoms. 

My mom eventually researched and realized it was ADHD. He eventually got diagnosed and treated and it helped (but didn‚Äôt solve, obvs). But this was very late in the game. 

So when you mention your mom being kind and loving and that ‚Äúeither version of me is valuable and accepted‚Äù - it‚Äôs hard for me to apply that to my own situation. Because it wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äúdad‚Äôs going to be late again,‚Äù it was ‚Äúdad‚Äôs going to hit me in a fit of rage because he got frustrated and can‚Äôt emotionally regulate.‚Äù 

And to bring this to the present time - my husband has ADHD but it isn‚Äôt being treated well currently. And so now it‚Äôs ‚Äúdad [my husband] forgot to feed the kids while mom was gone and the kids are super cranky before bedtime‚Äù and ‚Äúdad got distracted by his phone and didn‚Äôt see the 3 year old ride his bike into the road.‚Äù 

So I feel like I do have to demand that he own up to treating his symptoms appropriately in order for us to function as a family. And it‚Äôs not ok if his symptoms are out of control because they heavily impact his wife and kids. I ‚Äúlove him for who he is‚Äù but I don‚Äôt ‚Äúlove‚Äù his hurtful behavior. 

Anyhow, I‚Äôm really in the thick of this and am interested in outside perspectives if you or others have any thoughts."

"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","Links to and mentions of ADDitude are not allowed on /r/adhd because we feel they have demonstrated themselves to be untrustworthy and that they, despite soliciting donations from people with ADHD to fund their operation, prioritize profit and advertising dollars over our best interests. Their website is full of articles promoting the use of homeopathy, reiki, and other unscientific quack practices. They also have had articles for Vayarin (a medical food that is now no longer sold in the US because its research was bunk) that suspiciously looked like stealth advertisements (which is highly unethical and illegal in the US).

We also find it problematic that their medical review panel includes not only legitimate doctors and psychologists, but also (at the time of writing) one practitioner of integrative medicine, which combines legit medical practice with pseudoscience and alternative medicine. They have previously had other quacks on the panel as well.

"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","I'd just like to add to my above reply: 

NO ultimatum is a reasonable ultimatum. This is *your* health, ADHD is *your* condition that *you* suffer from. It doesn't matter if your symptoms bug him, his role regarding this is to support you, not play the victim and hang threats of abandonment over your head if you don't do things his way and according to his timeframe. He's literally attempting to hijack your personal and bodily autonomy and is trying to make you think that any non-compliance with that is a repulsive character flaw and that you should be rejected. It's morally wrong and abusive."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","Also another add-on. His comments about how if he found someone ‚Äúmore stable‚Äù then he would leave is very very wrong. For me that would have been an immediate dealbreaker. That shows that he does not care about you as a person and does not care to help you through this process. He doesn‚Äôt want to see your grow and adapt and become the best version of yourself, he just wants the easy route and he will learn very fast he will never find that with his current attitude. Especially stating he would like you better as a ‚Äúzombie‚Äù meaning he couldn‚Äôt care less about your true personality. Also very very horrible of him to do.

OP, I hope you read these comments and know you are supported by so many people. You are not a failure in the slightest. He was the one who failed at understand the point of a relationship. He is the one that failed to love you unconditionally and to not hurt you. If anything HE is the failure. You will grow to find far better than him and that person should make you feel amazing on every way. That person should make you feel confident. That person should make you feel like you‚Äôre never a burden. Your current partner is not the one for you. Sending lots of Internet hugs your way. I hope things get better for you ü§ç"

How could you ever feel secure in a relationship like that?

A partner should make you feel safe to be your whole self.

Check out this [simple website about emotional abuse](https://eqi.org/eabuse1.htm) and see if anything else there sounds familiar.

A quick snippet:

> Emotional abuse is like brain washing in that it systematically wears away at the victim's self-confidence, sense of self-worth, trust in their own perceptions, and self-concept. Whether it is done by constant berating and belittling, by intimidation, or under the guise of ""guidance,"" ""teaching"", or ""advice,"" the results are similar. Eventually, the recipient of the abuse loses all sense of self and remnants of personal value.

It's easier said than done to get out of a relationship like this, but I hope you know that there are wonderful, understanding, supportive men in the world who will make you feel irreplaceable. 

You deserve to meet one of them."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","Agreed. I have been on a non-stimulant ADHD medication for about a month now, and what I've found is that it doesn't completely fix forgetfulness, it just enables me to have the focus and energy I need to create and implement systems to help me combat that."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?",But meds will likely help your ADHD symptoms tho! So that's a bonus :)
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?",Seconding this. It is possible both for OPs partner to be abusive (whether maliciously or through inability to take responsibility for his own emotions) and for medication to help OP. Ditching this guy and then handling the medication issue separately is a completely valid option.
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?",I love your user name so much
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","Agreed - if anything the medication will allow OP to possibly remember more of their own emotions and where they came from from one moment to the next.  Getting on meds opened my eyes to what was happening in my relationship.  Suddenly, there were moments that I actually remembered what was said in an argument, and I started to realize that much of what he was doing was just launching into a bullying tirade about all the things wrong with me when I didn‚Äôt do what he wanted.  

It was pretty amazing when I started to realize that he was attacking to get me to change, not because he really thought those things about me.  It was a manipulation.

I‚Äôm still with him, but he can‚Äôt manipulate me anymore, so he gets to be the frustrated one for a while."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","Yeah, seconding this. 

The approach and the way the partner has gone about this is full on to say the least. Cruel, even. 

It's one thing to say 'hey, partner, some of the things I think are symptoms of your ADHD are hurting me, can we consider ways to manage them?' - which is way more mature and reasonable. It's another entirely to sit there and say they'd prefer a zombie, like, what the fuck. The problem from how it's described is just a lack of care for op. 

Hell, I can even get being burned out cause issues in a relationship aren't being addressed despite multiple go-overs, but you don't go about it like *that.* 

There's different options for medications, and honestly the success rate for a good chunk of them is significant. It really does make a difference when you can find the one that works for you and have the time to adjust to it. 

And, op, I'm real sorry you've had to go through all this. Compromise, care and respect is key. You're not unfitting as a partner because of the additional hurdles ADHD can present. It just means that needs have to be met in different ways sometimes, or communicated differently."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","This is the best answer.

Most people here are being very harsh against OP's partner but they may not realize how much education and communication it takes to help a NT person happily coexist with an ADHD partner. .  A lot of people who start out seemingly accepting get increasingly frustrated  and angry because they don't understand that it's not their responsibility to fix their partner or ""hold them accountable. "" They may think they are being supportive when they are actually being overbearing and undermining .

Nobody is born knowing how to do this! But to me the key is: are they willing to learn? I suspect that most truly abusive partners will angrily reject the idea of talking about the mechanics of the relationship wheras someone who is sincerely trying to do the right thing will embrace the idea of things like a consultation or even shared therapy to explore what is really needed."

"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner.

OP‚Äôs bf is the latter.
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","In the abstract, I agree with some part of this. My wife put up with a lot of my bad behaviors before I got treatment, and one of the reasons I wanted to handle this better was to be a better partner to her. My wife struggled with depression, in particular making her more reactive, and while I always did my best to be patient her medication erased a lot of stress I was feeling from that. I think it's important to make an effort to prevent your mental health from hurting your relationships.

But in my case (and presumably yours) we're talking about supportive, patient partners that are willing to work through these issues together. The boyfriend in this post is very very far from that, and ""suggesting meds"" is a *really* euphemistic way to phrase his behavior. The good advice to consider improving your relationships as part of a professionally guided treatment plan is best saved for a future partner.

And while I can't definitely say this (that's what the professionals are for), I really struggle to see where OP needs a stop-gap for her behaviors. These seem like annoyances (at worst) that can be worked on at a more comfortable pace. Especially if they're hesitant about medication."

Not discounting anything but we just dont know the reality of it.

That being said.  It could be a massive red flag.  OR... or it could be him struggling to stay and try and progress.  Relationships need to change/grow.  Sometimes people go on the same path, often they don't.  The take away is that he is still trying but doesn't know how and is making a wild assumption.

If you want kids, there's a chance they will have ADHD. Will he treat them the same way?

Leave him. Find someone who loves you whether you are on or off your meds. Personally, I am okay with my partners preferring me on my ADHD meds, but they better damned love me off them, too. I'm still human. 

My best example: I like green apple and cherry jolly ranchers nearly the same right now, but I slightly prefer green apple. I'd still take either in a heartbeat, but if I had the choice, I'd probably take more of the green apple. That doesn't mean I don't still love the cherry a whole lot.

 I believe his ‚Äúconcern‚Äù isn‚Äôt coming from a place of wanting to support her.
I don‚Äôt think her symptoms have caused that much stress to where he can‚Äôt act rationally. I think he‚Äôs using her ADHD as an excuse to be cruel. I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs showing his true colors. (Just my opinion)

OP if you get put on medication it should be because YOU want to. Not because you feel forced to in order to stay with someone.

"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","It's completely fair and valid that the BF feel loved, appreciated and listened to in their relationship.

OP is loving, appreciative and listens to her BF.

The problem is that the BF needs a different style of expression to what OP can offer.

The bigger problem is that the BF is being manipulative and dismissive of OP's feelings when discussing his unmet needs.

It's one thing to say ""I don't feel heard or supported when you tune out during long conversations, what can we do to change that?""

It's an entirely different thing to say ""if you don't take drugs to help you listen to me, I'm going to find someone else""

Couple's therapy with an ND aware counsellor may be helpful. 

But it sounds like both OP and the BF will be able to have their relationship needs met better with different people. 

-----

I'm ND and dating an NT guy.

Yes ,my ADHD means I don't remember events accurately, I have episodic memory so sometimes I perfectly remember small details from this one specific moment, but then there are other times I have no memory, or even false memories because of maladaptive daydreaming.

My partner understands that this is not intentional on my behalf, I'm trying my best to recall things accurately.

We trust each other to not use our differing perception of memory not to manipulate or mislead each other, and when my memory isn't matching reality, it's not an excuse to dismiss my experience, it's an opportunity to admire how weird my brain is, while teaching me about what *really* happened. 

I often struggle to pay attention and retain information during long conversations. It's not just with my partner, it's any conversation with anybody. My partner doesn't take it personally. He makes sure he's talking to me with no other dominating distractions (TV off, quiet room, not to dark or too bright, comfortable seating or standing), he knows I'm going to fidget with my hands, or that I'm not going to make a lot of eye contact. He understands that this is a side effect of how I focus, it's not a sign that I'm not listening. (We make other time in our relationship for eye contact & stillness, just not during intense conversations!)

Often I'll know he wants to talk about something serious because he'll hand me a fidget toy before he starts talking.

Chores are also an issue in our relationship, but not because he's upset that I forget chores. We're both really bad with housework and the house gets into states of choas and clutter and grime because I'm struggling with the mental energy needed to get it done and he's struggling with the physical energy needed. I'm getting much better because I'm trying to introduce ""routine stacking"" as part of my ADHD occupational therapy.

It's not a point of contention because my partner grew up in a family home that was always untidy to him its morally neutral whether a house is organised or messy.

But the state of the house is a point of stress for me. My mum was a saint who maintained a clean and organised home so me, and my ND brother and father could overcome some of the struggles our conditions created. 

Clutter and mess makes it easier for me to become blind to my surroundings and contribute to anxiety and overstimulation. I'm mad at myself that I can't do all the chores I know I need to do.

Routine stacking is helping a lot.

But my partner and I also plan ""working bees"" a few times a year to tackle big jobs, like purging my craft closet and emptying all the ""dump baskets of doom"" we have cluttering up every corner of every room where we dump things instead of putting them away.

These are just some of the things we work on together. I don't expect him to put up with my bad behaviour, I also don't expect him to bend over backwards to work around my adaptions. My goal in our relationship is to work together as a team to find tools and methods that help us both feel loved, appreciated and heard.

If my partner didn't have the same goal, to work as a team, they wouldn't be a very compatible partner for me."

BUT that doesn't mean you just have to take it or accept that bad behavior, either.

 It took several conversations but with ADHD, sometimes you HAVE to use a sledge to get a cross a point a hammer should have nailed. We can be sort of dense and have difficulty understanding how someone else might respond to something if that response is different from our own. 
Like, I don't have a lot of personal boundaries - I'll hug strangers. But turns out,  most strangers don't want to be hugged. When younger me learned that, it blew my little mind. Explain it to them again and don't be gentle. Be straight and honest and blunt. Find the root, the real issue. 

I dated a guy who though tickling was fun. I do not find it fun. We had several conversations.  He kept tickling ...because it was fun. Did we break up for tickling? No. We broke up for a lack of respect for boundaries. 

It may take you threatening the relationship.  And I don't mean in a manipulative way. Draw your lines and don't bluff. You cannot maintain a relationship with someone who is (even accidentally or unintentionally) abusive.  I didn't MEAN to hit you with my car... but you did and now there are consequences."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","To be clear, I'm not suggesting they threaten the relationship as a manipulation or to use empty threats. I'm saying they need to set strong boundaries, like my partner did with me, and make it very clear that if these boundaries are violated, they cannot continue with the relationship. The other person needs to understand with no uncertain terms that their relationship is dependent on this. 

It's sounds harsh when stated like that BUT it's no different, really, than any other ""rules"" you have in your relationships. Just most of the time those rules are unspoken or assumed. Like monogamy. It's taken for granted in most relationships that fidelity is the expectation and infidelity will result in a breakup. Or physical abuse. If someone hits you, you should end that relationship. Duh. That seems obvious. 

BUT sometimes the rules and boundaries in a relationship aren't so obvious. Like in our case, yelling. Maybe yelling at your partner should be equally as obvious but my mom also has ADHD and also has emotional outbursts and yells in frustration. I didn't feel particularly abused by it growing up. We all yelled. We're a family of passionate people who's volume and emotions are directly tied to our volume. Yelling was an expression not a tool to abuse. But that's not how that is for my partner and, as it turns out, being yelled at isn't okay for most people. 

He had to set that boundary that strongly because that's litterally what it took for my thick ADHD brain to finally recognize it as a real problem and seek addition help rather than  just ""trying to do better.""

And that contingent boundary gets to exist BECAUSE I have ADHD and he understands that emotional deregulation is a thing. I really didn't mean to abuse him (and he knows that. If malice was even suspected, it wouldn't have been a boundary, it would just have been a divorce.) But understanding it doesn't mean he's going to accept it or allow it to continue. How many times does someone accidently punch you in the face before you say no more or just remove yourself from being around that person?"

This comment summarizes my many thoughts on this matter. OP, even if meds were to make you the ‚Äòperfect‚Äô partner, you need someone who will fully love you both medicated and unmedicated. Life is unpredictable and there are so many reasons why you could have to stop medication after taking it for a while, you can‚Äôt plan a life around being medicated all the time. 


Also, the right meds shouldn‚Äôt make you feel like a zombie. Maybe try a different medication or a lower dose (only if YOU want to though!)"

"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","Right, of course. I agree. No one needs to be in a relationship that isn‚Äôt working for them, no matter the reason. I think the problem here is his assertion that he might leave at any moment for someone else and that he seems to be confident that her mental health treatment exists for his benefit. If he is ready to leave, he should. If he would like to find a better partner, he may do so. Using the threat of this possibility to control her actions is uncalled for; it betters nothing. If he does not like her ADHD symptoms specifically and hopes they can work it out somehow, he can present his point of view and see what she wants to do to better herself (if she‚Äôs interested in that, which it sounds like she is). If he doesn‚Äôt think he can work with her preferences in treatment, then at least they tried‚Äîmutually beneficial to part ways at that point, really."

Thoughts?",">He's yelling at her for not following a conversation, he's told her he's gonna leave her once he finds someone better, she was getting meds, but it wasn't soon enough.

>All this anger, impatience and cruelty are signs of abuse.

This. The things that he's mad at her for are things that are not likely to go away with medication. I'm on medication, and all our does is help me function in a somewhat reasonable way in my daily life. Don't get me wrong, it's leaps and bounds better than when I'm not on medication. But it's nowhere near the level of someone who doesn't have ADHD. I still get lost in conversations sometimes; I still forget things on the regular. 

I think he's got unrealistic expectations of what the medication will accomplish for her. And to threaten that he'll immediately bail on her the moment someone without ADHD comes along says to me that he cares very little for her as a person. I agree, I think that it's abusive behavior. I'd be thinking long and hard before staying with someone who clearly doesn't want to be in a relationship with a person who has ADHD. Which is absolutely his choice. But to speak to her this way, and make his not wanting to be with her specifically as HER fault, THAT'S actual gaslighting."
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner.

And if the op is trying to explain their position when he expresses a problem, if op is like my partner with ADHD that means op also uses minimizing to cope with negative feedback. If that's true then op is probably downplaying the severity of their own behaviors, or possibly honestly doesn't realize it happens more frequently than they think it does. 

To me this seems like the tragic dynamic of a person with ADHD that isn't well managed and a person without it that is personalizing the symptoms but also being met with denial and defensiveness at every turn. It turns toxic quick like that but it's not very fair to assume it's all bc of the partner."

Your post doesnt sound like thatll happen. Its gonna take effort on your part, AND patience on his. Potentially it also means meds for you and therapy for him. But an attitude of ""i let this go for so long, ive done so much for you by not being a jerk about it this whole time and now you owe me: heres an ultimatum"" is not conducive to a happy partnership.

That being said, i was in a similar spot recently with my partner. I was given an ultimatum to get a career job. Im still working on the help i need and frankly nothing changed yet (thanks covid), but were still together. Things are looking up and were closing on a new house this week. I noticed a suspicious improvement in our relationship when they started counseling.

They are wrong. 

It might be frustrating for the neurotypical partner. They are not obliged to accept it. 

But the partner doesn‚Äôt get to tell you that You Are The Problem for the Whole Relationship because of the way your brain is wired. 

As others have said - while the adhd brain probably introduces some items that need attention, other things like ‚Äúbeing kinder‚Äù and ‚Äúcompromise better‚Äù are stuff that your partner could usefully work on.

"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","First of all, this is an ADHD subreddit and this whole sub is a tangent discussion. 

That is a difficult situation to be in. I don‚Äôt know if these are exactly the same situation. I would not call my father‚Äôs ADHD severe, he probably would fall into more of the mild or moderate category. He also has a few friends he works out with almost every day, and has a work schedule that‚Äôs somewhat independent and somewhat regulated as he owns his business. Due to those things, I think he was able to cope enough with it to not be neglectful. However, ADHD symptoms a lot of the time can be stressful and difficult to deal with.

I don‚Äôt know what your husband‚Äôs doing for treatment at the moment, but I know treatment for me made a huge difference. If he‚Äôs not on medication, I‚Äôd encourage him to try something. If he is and it‚Äôs not working, there might be another medication to try. Also, it‚Äôs sometimes annoying to set up but therapy can really help a lot, either individually or together. I‚Äôve had married friends go to counseling together, and they say it really can make a difference. 

You guys got married for a reason and you can still love him for who he is, but having ADHD does not excuse abusive or neglectful behavior. My vision is pretty bad and I need pretty strong glasses. If I decided to drive without them and I caused an accident because of that, I couldn‚Äôt have the excuse of ‚Äúoh it was because I wasn‚Äôt wearing glasses.‚Äù I think the same applies here, at least to an extent. 

I hope this helps a little bit, and that your situation improves soon!"

I exited a psychologically abusive relationship where I was constantly made to feel that I was never good enough. My ADHD was a something she'd commonly bring up to make me feel defective. Turns out a lot of what I thought was a symptom of my ADHD (brain fog, poor memory, rejection sensitivity, confusion, low self esteem, self doubt, emotional disregulation) was actually a result of the chronic stress of of existing in a psychologically abusive relationship with a narcissist. If that sounds anything like what you're going through, save yourself! Leave before it gets worse.

However, this conversation was incredibly kind and filled with a sense of teamwork. I expressed that his ADHD was an explanation, not an excuse, and that yes, he would have to work harder than other people might have to - but he‚Äôs capable! 

Your partner giving you an ultimatum for existing as you are isn‚Äôt fair. Asking you to be better is fair, your partner has needs, too, and has every right to have them fulfilled. However, his tactics here seem cruel and I truly think you can find a more compassionate partner in life.

I agree he is being an asshat and could say do things better.  Not saying SO doesn't need work on relationship too.  Offering only one narrow solution to a one sided argument is disingenuous of advice.  Its telling them how to live their life based on their perspective of the moment.  There is much wrong with that.
"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","Maybe, but they could also be the at the end of their rope and are pushing the meds because its a part of treatment. We only have one side of the story, and while I am fully believing OP's side, I do know that when I'm in an ADHD spiral and anxiety on top of that causes my head to end up in a spin... I'm not exactly always the easiest person to reason with.

I think pointing to this as an immediate BF red flag and he's a horrible person might be the wrong way of looking at it. If OP wants to try and make it work after starting treatment, it could turn around. Every relationship has ups and downs and not everyone is always at their best - on either side of the coin.

I'm not saying OP should stay forever, but if they both want to try and work on it, and treatment helps, there's nothing inherently wrong with making an effort as a couple if that's what they want to do. I think that's all some people are getting at such as /u/cowabungass

Now, the whole ""if i find someone stable I'm gone"" bit is rough. I'm hoping it's coming from a place of frustration and isn't actually how they feel, but if its honestly that, then I say I agree with the leaving thing. 

I guess, I'm trying to couch my answers so that if someone finds this via search they don't see ""NT partner wants me to get meds and has been fighting with me"" as some sort of immediate terrible scenario. 

OP's partner may be acting like a dick, maybe he is at the end of his rope, maybe not, I don't know, but for the random searcher, I think its important to realize that there are challenges in relationships - ADHD is a chronic one that will need to be dealt with both with ups and downs over the years - and sometimes its workable, and sometimes it gets ugly but can be fixed with time to improve."

I still think, maybe the partner is at the end of his rope, and maybe OP is misunderstanding some things too - I know I've been in that kind of space where it takes me some time to realize how I didn't help any situation and both my wife and I just hit a wall. But we're committed to eachother and working on it together and figuring out what does and doesn't work in terms of the condition now that it has a name (diagnosed this year). I think a bit of a cooling off period and re-assessing isn't the end of the world either. 

While the BF is framing things poorly, maybe its just because nothing else seemed to work? IDK, a little effort goes a long way and maybe even if OP needs to adjust treatment etc, its a first step that helps them both. Maybe not. 

I just always have a hard time telling people to end relationships immediately because it feels like that's the kneejerk reddit response to everything"

Assuming everything occurred the way OP has stated here (which is all we have to go off of), I believe the biggest indicators is when the bf said if he found something better while they were dating then he would go for it. This is manipulative. If he wants to leave then he should leave. He is trying to get her to race to ‚Äúget better‚Äù before he finds someone else to be with. Whether he is frustrated and at his wits end or not, this is still manipulation therefore also a red flag.
Manipulation tactics end up causing people to have trauma that they can deal with their entire lives. It‚Äôs not fair to her to endure this. It is entirely possible that he‚Äôs not even a bad guy and he has stuff he‚Äôs dealing with too. This doesn‚Äôt mean that they are in a good relationship though and that it will work out in the end. There are plenty of ppl that are good and do not belong together or cant make it work. It is also entirely possibly that he isn‚Äôt a good person and she should run the other way. Who knows? All OP can do is take what behavior and actions he has shown her and make the decision if she wants be manipulated by him. 
The original post was her asking if this was normal (healthy) behavior or not because she can‚Äôt tell anymore. She has been manipulated and is now unsure. 
For the record OP, this is not healthy normal behavior."

So I am the ADHD partner but I also *have* an ADHD partner. He has other mental health struggles that he's chosen to manage with coping strategies and monitoring from his doctor instead of medication because he hates the way those medications affect him emotionally and physically. I 100% support that decision and help him stick to his positive coping methods and let him know if I'm seeing an increase in his symptoms.     
It may sometimes have been easier for me if he was medicated for this but that decision should not have shit to do with me and how I feel about it. That's purely a conversation between him and his doctor. My opinion on his medication should only come out when specifically asked for and taken with a grain of salt since I'm not a doctor! Plus I'd never want him to do anything with his physical or mental health that he wasn't fully comfortable with.       
     
The whole situation is really controlling and his reactions do not convey any genuine care, concern, or affection. Fuck a red flag, this is a red billboard."

Even if you're at the end of your rope, saying this like ""I would leave you for someone more stable"" or ""I prefer a zombie over who you actually are"" is *never* okay. That is not phrasing things wrong. I grew up in an abusive household, and know more women than I'd like in abusive relationships. People in abusive relationships are constantly told it's just ""miscommunication"" from their abusive partners, and even from friends and family that don't understand abuse. To be honest I'm only responding later because that line inspires a lot of negative emotions for me.

What often happens in abusive relationships is such a wild shift from ""normal"" that you can blame yourself for totally ridiculous things. Like look at OP, trying to get *emergency* treatment for medication over simple annoyances, and blaming herself for her partner's reaction to those things. Sometimes what people need is a big group of internet strangers to remind people what ""normal"" is, and reinforce that they deserve better than they're being treated. Unfortunately reddit gets a lot of advice posts from people in toxic relationships, and eventually became a hammer that sees most problems as a nail. But sometimes a nail is a nail.

"Partner wants me on meds or it‚Äôs over. Says I‚Äôm ‚Äòeverything they want,l‚Äô But unless I get my ADHD under control, they will not take me seriously as a partner. Thoughts?","I wish you luck. Communicating with ADHD can be difficult as we (or at least I) don't read well between the lines and need straight and blunt and harsh. But also, ADHD tends to take criticism very personally and we devolve into self hatred.

Come from a place of love and wanting to keep the relationship but make him understand your side. Use harsh examples like when my partner explained to me ""Every time you yell, you punch me in the face."" How would I respond if someone punched me in the face?  

If you're careful to keep the focus on behaviors and not on him as a person, you can get away with a lot more bluntness. But if you feel like he's missing something or spirling down a hole, you can use a trick I learned from someone else. Ask them ""what do you think I just said"" or ""what did you hear me say?"" These are great check-in questions because it helps you be able to re-frame and interrupts their spiral. 

ADHD often has auditory issues and we can have trouble listening to long, involved speeches. Getting directly to your point will be helpful.  

""I want this relationship but I cannot continue if these things continue or if these conditions are not met."" 
Think about every good manager you've ever had and approach it like a performance review. 

I would not try to have the conversation until you're very clear in your own mind what the specific issues are and what your boundaries are moving forward. If you start a list for yourself and its more than one thing and those things cannot be condensed into one concept....then you may realize that this just isn't worth it-  Like it's unreasonable to ask him to change too much at once and you don't have the mental health space to struggle through more abuse. 
And there's always the chance that he won't see or agree with your experience of the relationship and won't want put in the work to amend his behaviors.  And in both cases, you should be prepared for the inevitable.  

I wish you luck. I'm sorry you're struggling. Boundaries are hard at first but with practice comes confidence and comforability. You deserve someone who takes your shit into as much consideration as you take theirs."

And how is it not abusive for us to let our untreated mental health issues destroy our relationship and then complain when our partner can‚Äôt take it anymore? Like  I get that it‚Äôs not nice to say that you‚Äôre going to leave for somebody else the first chance that you get, but do you really think that is all there is to the story? I don‚Äôt. People don‚Äôt just say that stuff, it always comes from somewhere. A place of hurt and neglect. Remember that we are not the only ones with needs, and if the bf wants to stay but isn‚Äôt getting his needs met in his current relationship, there is nothing wrong with saying ‚Äúif you won‚Äôt get your mental health under control, I‚Äôm going to find somebody who will.‚Äù"

I unknowingly have said things and done things that hurt my partner and have tried to mould them into the perfect s/o. Had I continued in that relationship I never would have changed and she would have been just as unhappy.

On the off chance hes like me and thinks being the shit means putting others down he may benefit from being the one knocked down. I took it really hard, at first I was so angry but ultimately I realized the one who was to blame was me. She didnt leave because of some hotter guy or some far away job. She left because I gave her no other choice. While she was trying to build me up selflessly, I selfishly undermined all of her ambition and caused her to doubt herself.

Maybe he's being factual but isn't realizing that there's a ""fact"" side and an ""emotional"" side to experiences. 

I think the internet is full of terrible rabbit hole conclusion jumping. I've seen posts about ""weaponized incompetence"" for people doing things with mistakes or forgetting and then I think - my god, my ADHD could be described as weaponized incompetence and that I'm trying to make my wife do everything. When really, I just forget steps or get overwhelmed by certain things like laundry folding and it has nothing to do with doing a bad job to make her do it for me. It's straight up something I struggle with and can't solve easily. I try but it's always going to be a thing that some days works other days doesn't.

I said there could be chance its not a red flag but him mistakenly popping off in the wrong way.  You are choosing to add malice to my comments for no reason but to feel good?  To troll?

The chip on your shoulder must be huge.  Maybe just trolling?  Either way, you are very much an example of the attitude that is wrong with this world when you ignore what people say and add your own context to things that were never spoken or conveyed.

If that is how you truly read my words then I suggest you brush up on your comprehension.

She‚Äôs still in an unhealthy relationship. 
As to the possibility of a benign option, does it matter why OP‚Äôs SO is acting this way? She has already talked to him about it and tried to get him to see from her POV and he said she was gaslighting him. If the way he is treating her results in a malignant relationship then it cannot be benign, whether or not he meant it to be that way or not. Abuse is abuse whether or not it was intended. The reason OP came here was to entertain other options. She loves him and WANTS this to be ok behavior b/c she doesn‚Äôt want to leave or is not ready to. She‚Äôs asking the internet because she deep down knows something isn‚Äôt right. Sometimes when you are being abused it is easier to ask the internet or a Reddit page than someone irl that would judge you if you didn‚Äôt take their advice.

Thoughts?","Well for starters - it sounds like he is making no attempt to change anything about himself to meet in the middle - rather just expecting OP to change themselves. 

A few points I noticed could be helped from his side rather easily and I think that may be what people are pointing out as potentially abusive behaviours. 
For example: OP explaining their perspective at the start of an apology rather than the end. This is someing that would be very difficult to change for someone with ADHD because it requires the executive functioning to automatically arrange the thought processes in the correct order. It is such a common quirk of people with ADHD and it shouldn't be an issue at all if they are actually being listened to... All the information is there, without a change in meaning despite the backwards order. However, BF could practice active listening and learn more about how OP operates cognitively, that would be quite easy and would benefit most other areas of his life. 

That's just how I saw it though"

And why should the bf put in the emotional labor of trying to understand our backwards way of thinking when we are the ones with the backwards thinking? Like I get that empathy is important, but are we really expecting our partners to just rearrange themselves to fit us better instead of us arranging ourselves to fit society better? And to what end? Is it reasonable to ask somebody to modify their behavior so that they can deal with us or is it more reasonable for us to modify ourselves so that we can be more easy to be with? I know that Executive Functioning hinders us A LOT but asking somebody else to constantly put in 150% so that we only need to put in 50% is not a sustainable thing to ask. 

Like would it be reasonable to say to your boss ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt function the same way everybody else does, so I‚Äôm going to need you to completely change the rules here and pick up my slack at the same time. Oh and I will be needing to be paid the same as everybody else. And if you complain or say you‚Äôre going to start looking for somebody new, I‚Äôll say you‚Äôre abusing me.‚Äù?

I don‚Äôt think so. 

We know ourselves better than anybody, and because of that it‚Äôs up to us to do what we need to do to make sure we are not being an emotional burden on those we love. We can‚Äôt expect our partners to be there for us 100% when we can‚Äôt even be there for ourselves, let alone for our partners"

To my understanding, this combo is common for people with ADD and depression. I‚Äôm on 60mg vyvanse and 300mg HCL XL Wellbutrin. Now for the evening crashes, this has been my experience for a long long time, I finally talked to my doc and he was very open and understanding of my situation.

Everybody‚Äôs body is different, and I‚Äôm actually thinking about upping my amphetamine salts. However, I honestly am not knowledgeable enough to understand why your doctor would prescribe Wellbutrin for afternoon crashes.

I quit binge drinking, quit smoking, lost 60lbs, started actually saving money, started addressing issues that I never could before, etc.  It was like before, I was constantly in a flood zone, apt to be slammed this way or that.  Wellbutrin finally anchored me.  I still get depressed and I still feel shitty and my anxiety is worse on Wellbutrin than Zoloft but I can handle it now instead of just drinking myself stupid.  I never want to go off of Wellbutrin, never.  It was a brutal first two weeks, the worst I've ever had with another medication, but it was absolutely and totally worth it."
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","I‚Äôve been on Wellbutrin as a kicker for my antidepressant for years. I started on biphentin this year and now am on vyvanse. My dr, nor pharmacist, said anything about the combo"
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","I took Bupropion and Vyvanse together late last year. I had previously been on the highest dose of sertraline, but I switched providers and my new psychiatrist didn‚Äôt like prescribing my dose. It felt like a good time to try something new so we made the switch to bupropion. 

I loved how I was able to have laser sharp focus on bupropion, but it also made me have very little patience. I felt like I was in a constant state of rage and eventually small tasks began to feel overwhelming. My mother-in-law ended up having to fly out on short notice to help take of my family, because I couldn‚Äôt function. Contacted my psychiatrist and she had me stop taking bupropion immediately and switched me back to sertraline. 

So yeah, it doesn‚Äôt work everyone. But from what I‚Äôve gathered if it DOES work for you then it ends up working really really well. I guess the advice I‚Äôd give is to keep track of your mood. Let family or close friends know that you‚Äôre switching meds and have them tell you if they notice a significant change in mood or behavior."
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","Was misdiagnosed w depression for most of my life. The ssris made me even more apathetic and I could get almost nothing done. The doc added Wellbutrin to help me w a little boost. It helped a little but not much. 

Finally at 39 I was diagnosed with adhd. Started adderall and all my depression symptoms went away. Reduced down to the smallest dose of ssri. Still have Wellbutrin. 

Couldn‚Äôt tell you what life is like just on adderall but things seem fine here"
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","I take Vyvanse and Bupropion together and it's worked really well for me. 

The doses you take for each might make a difference in how your body reacts, so it's something to keep in mind. In case it helps, I'm on 30 mg Vyvanse and Buproprion 150 mg.

The first year, I took Vyv in the morning and Bpr at night. Vyvanse really suppressed my appetite during the day and it became a huge problem for me. I lost so much weight that my family were worried and had to intervene. But I could always get out of bed so easily in the morning. This was something I'd never experienced before in my life and I really miss it. Anxiety was totally fine but I was back to being pretty emotional. It didn't numb me the way other anti depressants did. 

I switched to taking them together. So Vyv and Bpr at the same time in the morning. It made the world of a difference. I don't have issues with appetite anymore and can eat regularly now. But I'm back to finding it hard to get out of bed in the morning, which has been the case my whole life to be honest, so it's not the medication's fault. Anxiety is still totally fine and manageable. 

I want to also share that people are more likely to share horror stories than success ones, because they want to warn others. It comes from a good place, and it's really kind of people to take the time to share these experiences. But it's good to remember that most people with good experiences don't bother writing about it. Research has shown that people won't usually write good/positive reviews for restaurants and products as much as they will for negative ones. It's human nature and I do it too. So just remember that negative experiences that are shared on here are important, but they may not be representative of the majority of people taking these meds."
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","I‚Äôve been taking it for 3 years now. It‚Äôs been the only constant medication amongst all of the other trials and errors. I‚Äôve taken every version and every dose in that time, but ultimately learned it gives me what my brain really needs. 

I started it after trying 2 SSRIs with my PCP, then went to a psychiatrist who made me stop Wellbutrin and try a different SSRI again. Then she prescribed Wellbutrin to me again to combat the SSRI side effects lol. Once I maxed out on Wellbutrin dosages she prescribed me Adderall to replace it, but ended up needing both. She kept me on a super small dose of different SSRI during that time too, but I stopped that a few months ago to see if it had any effect on my weight. My current combo is 70mg Vyvanse, 75mg Wellbutrin, and 40mg Propanolol 2xs a day. 

I‚Äôve taken Wellbutrin alongside both Adderall and Vyvanse with no issues. Of course it completely depends on the person though and communicating with a psych/doc throughout the process is the most important thing. Just wanted to share a positive experience though!"
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?",I have tried both & it didn't work out. I had bad side effects that made anxiety worst. SSRI & SNRI didn't help with my anxiety. I take a different class of medication for anxiety that is not suppose to work but works for me.
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","I take Mydayis, Venlaflaxine, and Bupropion.   My doctor says to take them all in the morning, but I don‚Äôt.   I take the MyDayis and Venlaflaxin around 4:15am and the Bupropion around noon.   I added the Bupropion about a month ago and its made a real difference.   I feel like this is the best combo of prescriptions I‚Äôve ever had. 

As a side note, I wake up around 4:15am using a vibrating alarm that picks a a time between 3:45 and 4:15 that I‚Äôm close to awake in my sleep cycle.  I take the pills and go back to bed.  I get up around 6:30am with no grogginess and have 1 cup of coffee.   I usually don‚Äôt eat breakfast.  

When I took the pills at 6:30 and drank coffee, it tended to upset my stomach.   No issues with that now.   And, taking the Bupropion around noon really helps with executive function after 9pm."
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?",I'm on Wellbutrin and Adderall. I'm having good results.
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","I take both - Wellbutrin + Vyvanse. Excellent combo for me (was on SSRIs for a few years and felt like the world was one shade of a very flat and ugly grey). I can sometimes get short or impatient, but that‚Äôs usually when I was not diligent about eating food/drinking water."
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","I took it for depression. But not with a stimulant. However, I did love it. I wish I were still taking it."
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?",What stimulant do you take with it depends on the exact stimulant
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","yes on vyvanse and wellbutrin rn. I think that it‚Äôs a really good combo for me, I think that the wellbutrin mitigates any anxiety and the vyvanse of course helps with focus."
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?",I take adderall and bupropion. The bupropion gives me an extra boost to get me through the mornings but adderall works better for focus. I don't have too many side effects - I just have to make sure to hydrate and keep caffeine levels minimal or I start getting some anxiety.
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?",Tried it for a couple months this past year and it did not work for me. I had a few crazy episodes during that time that I am so ashamed of. I went crazy jealous on my husband over absolutely nothing and also flipped out on my in-laws for something minor. Both episodes were legit scary for me and everyone around me. I told my psychiatrist and he apologized and pulled me off them immediately. He said that Wellbutrin can have that effect on some people. It was weird because at first I thought I loved Wellbutrin. It felt like it gave me an energy boost so I was surprised I didn‚Äôt recognize the impact it was having on me.
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","I take both. I just take wellbutrin for smoking cessation. It does nothing else for me.  I also take an SSRI for anxiety. Which works very well.  I don't really like taking the wellbutrin because the combo with Adderall makes my blood pressure high, so now I also take blood pressure pills, lol.  But that's not going to last forever."
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","Yup.  Taken a low dose of Wellbutrin and a stimulant for years, from the beginning.  For me, this combination has been very successful."
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?",I did not like Wellbutrin with amphetamines
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","I‚Äôve been on Wellbutrin for‚Ä¶ wow, almost 15 years I think. It‚Äôs been the most reliable antidepressant for me and my dosage has fluctuated to the max, then we tried cocktails combining others with it, then I was off everything for about a year or two, but now I‚Äôm only on a lower dose of it. I was just diagnosed with ADHD last April and given Adderall XR. I don‚Äôt think the combination of the two would have any more effects than you would have otherwise had if you were only on the Wellbutrin. It‚Äôs like anything else though, it may work or it may not, and it‚Äôs different for everyone. But if you trust your Dr I say at least try it and monitor closely and ask trusted people to keep an eye on you as well and provide feedback. It could be great or it could be a chance to rule it out and get closer to finding out what does work."
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?",Wellbutrin changed my life. I had tried numerous medications that all made me suicidal. I was misdiagnosed bipolar for a long time and had questioned that diagnosis for a couple of years. When I started Wellbutrin I felt better. More productive. That was what made me find a new psych to get a new evaluation.
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?",I take vyvanse and recently tried to take bupropion in conjunction and the bupropion made me extremely tired like I had taken sedatives. It was really weird so I stopped taking it. I had taken it about 4-5 years ago for a couple of years with no issues.
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?",I‚Äôve done Wellbutrin with Concerta without issues. Until I couldn‚Äôt refill my concerta at least.
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?",I‚Äôve been taking Wellbutrin and adderall (Xr and instant release) for 15+ years now. No problems whatsoever. The Wellbutrin doesn‚Äôt give my any sort of stimulant effects (but surprising as it‚Äôs not a stimulant). And it doesn‚Äôt help my adhd at all. Just helps with depression. I wouldn‚Äôt be worried at all taking Wellbutrin with a stimulant it‚Äôs very safe.
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?",I take Wellbutrin and Vyvanse! I love the combo.
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?",I don't use stimulants but I'm using Strattera for ADHD. I felt great with Strattera but my energy level is low generally so I started using Wellbutrin with it. At first it gave me palpitations and couldn't sleep all night. So I took Wellbutrin in the morning and Strattera in the afternoon. It's great now. I can sleep at 2am and still can wake up at 9am without needing anymore sleep. I feel good and motivated to do things like excersize.
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","I'm on wellbutrin, adderall, abilify, and prozac. So far the combo is helpful, though I just restarted wellbutrin about 3 weeks ago. I had a really bad experience with it before but this time seems better. I did tell some close coworkers and friends to let me know if I get too manic or anything...so far so good."
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","I‚Äôm on both and I‚Äôm doing great.

Everybody is different."
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","I tried it for about 10 days. I ended up more irritable than usual and had terrible nausea, so I stopped taking the Wellbutrin.  I was hoping to get through a month bc I know many side effects go away over time, but it was too disruptive to my life."
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?",I started Wellbutrin abt 4 weeks ago and it‚Äôs amazing. My mood is way better and irritation is gone. It‚Äôs definitely helping me. Motivation is better too. I will say tho that it‚Äôs not helping my focus much
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?",My meds (when I can afford them) are dexedrine and wellbutrin. One for procrastination/motivation and one for focus and concentration. They work for me.
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","I have taken both stimulants and wellbutrin separately and together. Wellbutrin works fairly well on me. Not as well as I‚Äôd like but it does something at least. Stimulants do nothing. I feel like I‚Äôm taking a sugar pill, sometimes a very expensive sugar pill. But that‚Äôs just me. It will be different for everyone. It might work for you, it might not. I know it sucks but the only way to find out is to try. We‚Äôre in this together, I‚Äôm also trying out a new med combo rn! :)"
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","Oh good one I can answer! Bupropion worked super well with my vyvanse as I was concerned about it not working well enough to motivate me in college when I went to the psychiatrist for worsening depression. Started me on bupropion and although I was scared and ashamed, I started taking it. An excellent decision, the two worked harmoniously for me. Brought depression under control without suppressing my mood/emotions (unless they get to a point where they would be overwhelming, like when my grandfather passed). 

If your doc thinks it‚Äôs a good idea then you should take it, just monitor how you‚Äôre feeling and how it affects you, and call the doc for an emergency session if depression is getting worse or you start to have thoughts of harming yourself or others."
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","Yes, thanks for sharing this. I said the same thing in my comment."
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","I try to be aware of this, I believe people having happy lives with balanced meds for ADHD probably don't come here much, they don't need it, I can't wait to resume my life not thinking of my diagnosis and meds all the time and go back at pursuing my passions and hobbies. It's exhausting. But right now I can't function so I made a plan to get the right meds, therapy, and hopefully solve this mess as quickly as possible! üòä"
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","Awesome it worked so well for you! What can I expect in the first two weeks? I have more problems with anxiety and paralysis than impulse control, but I would love to lose some weight for real and start exercising and stuff like that..."
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?",I just started Wellbutrin as a kicker for my lexapro 3 days ago. Also take vyvanse‚Ä¶ for me it‚Äôs feeling like a game changer so far!!! I can sleep again!!!!
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","It sounds like a gamble, how many days it took for you to feel bad on it? I heard it takes time for Bup to act..."
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","It (bupropion) does tend to give me more anxiety and irritability, I‚Äôve found. But a low dose of sertraline really helps me stay sane and works well with adderall."
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?",What ssri do you take now?
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","This is me ! Every antidepressant makes me unable to do anything! Currently on just Wellbutrin, doing ok . I wonder if an adhd med would help more ?"
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","Yes, I agree and try to be aware. I just have no idea if this combination is usually successful, so I decided to ask. People that are happy and balanced with their ADHD meds probably don't even come to this sub, and I can't wait to be able to resume my life and stop thinking about meds and ADHD a the time!"
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","You might try taking the medications an hour or so before you want to get up for the day. I know that can be a hassle or dicey with falling back asleep, but if you can make it work, it‚Äôs super helpful for many. The drug can begin working so you wake up with more energy."
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","Thank you for taking time to write a long, positive experience! It's rare to see those! What worries me now is getting my heart too accelerated, since I'm overweight... I've been taking Propanolol to help with anxiety!"
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?",Can I ask what is it that you take just for curiosity sake?
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?",Can I ask where you got your alarm clock or what brand it is?
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?",Always nice to know about successful cases!
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?",Yeah I took some antidepressives before but they usually makes me feel even more anxious.
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","Oh, this sounds great! Happy to hear it worked, maybe you should go after trying it again if you're depressed!"
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","Concerta 36mg. I tried Vyvance and it made me feel awful and I could't sleep, it seems like methilphenidate is better for me (Ritalin also worked)."
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","Sounds great, good that works for you!"
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?",Nice! Its great it works fine for you!
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","I'm sorry you went through a bad episode, I hope you're feeling better and more safe now."
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?",What SSRI do you take?
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","Nice! Happy to hear it works for some people, I have an ADHD friend that loves her Bupropion!"
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","Well, I'm on Concerta but I wanted to hear opinions on Stimulants in general... It doesn't work well with everyone."
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","They keep changing doctors so no, I don't have no one I trust at the moment. This is why I'm here, I trust the sub better tbh (I'm working on getting another good doctor though but mine left the health plan)"
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","I lived as a misdiagnosed Bipolar for 3 years, and I tried every med under the sun. The meds would only make me feel worse and more miserable until I started to think something was wrong, started studying about ADHD, and went for evaluations! This is why I was on Seroquel for years..."
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?",Yeah I heard it can leave you sedated...
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","It's sad you couldn't refill it, I hope you get more medication soon!"
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?",I thought both could give heart palpitations so I worried... I want the Bup to help me with anxiety and paralysis the most! Thanks for sharing a positive experience.
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?",Great it worked for you!
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?",I hope it keeps being a good combo for you! :)
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","Yeah, sometimes the side effects are unbearable, it happens with a lot of meds. Better to stop, 10 days are a lot."
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","OP here, I started yesterday! I'm hoping for the best!"
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?",Good to know it helps!
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?",Stimulants certainly work for me! :) What are you trying?
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","Thank you. I worry about feeling my emotions dampened by it, like when I took Seroquel, but I'll give it a try."
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","Well, the big issue for me was that I was taking it along with my Adderall so my body was like 'holy shit that's a lot of stimulants' and I was out of it for a while until my body adjusted.  I full on needed mid day naps.  I also felt really on edge and my emotional dysregulation wasn't great.  I also had really wicked constipation for some reason which was not super fun.  But then my body adjusted and I could just... do stuff.  I could get up and go for a walk.  I could eat healthier foods.  The wild thing with me losing the 60lbs was that I was not even trying, it just happened, I full on went to see a doctor because I was a little worried with how fast it happened.  But my neurobiology was suddenly healthy so all of this stuff that I'd beaten myself up for not doing before was possible.  It was wild."
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?",The feeling of being able to sleep and not lay in bed for 5 hours is so amazing.
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","It‚Äôs pretty easy to go on or off from my experiences, what doctors say and anecdotal here. You should talk to your doctor about it, but if you‚Äôre on a low dose like 150mg, you can just stop will probably be their advice if you notice bad effects.

Always talk to your doctor and follow their advice, not us. I‚Äôm only speaking for my experience, but it was not bad to try."
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","I think I started showing poor side effects a week after I started. My psychiatrist said that yeah it can take a little while to start working too. I ended up staying on it for a month, just to give my body time to adjust, but it only got worse. 

It did really help me focus, though. If you have a good support system around you it might be worth trying."
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","Maybe I need to revisit it with sertraline, because I seriously have never been so focused in my life as I was when I was on bupropion."
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?",Late reply (ADHD style) but I just wanted to say thank you so much for sharing this. It's really helped so I appreciate it a lot!
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","I started Propanolol early on for anxiety as well and it has literally lowered my resting heart rate from high 80s to low 70s even with Wellbutrin and stimulants, so hopefully it‚Äôs the same experience for you! I also work out a lot while on my medication and my heart rate is totally within a normal range. And I‚Äôm overweight too, which is why I stopped my SSRI recently to see if it was what was preventing weight loss. 

My biggest concern has always been high blood pressure because my mom has high BP but since getting all of my medications right finally my blood pressure is better than ever. 

We seem to have quite a bit in common but medication is always tricky so what works for someone doesn‚Äôt always work for someone else. Unfortunately it just takes a lot of trial and error, but good luck!"
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","I was about to say with vyvanse that‚Äôs a no, don‚Äôt know much about concerta when in doubt ask your doctor these questions or call the office and talk to a nurse or ask your pharmacist"
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?",Thanks! Let's hope it lasts!
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?",Lexapro
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","God seroquel was AWFUL for me. That one was by far the worst. I was just collapsing on the floor and sobbing uncontrollably multiple times a day. I can‚Äôt even name every medication I was on because there was so many. My current psych looked at my list and he was like well you‚Äôve tried everything else so I have no reason to believe that your original diagnosis was correct. Before him I had gone to a psych who was just an adderall pusher so I already knew that vyvanse and adderall was beneficial but it was finding the right dose and a psych who was actually helpful. I went from 6 or 7 psych meds a day down to 3. Adderall, Wellbutrin, and then naltrexone for binge eating. THC to help me shut down at night because sleeping is boring and I need to be tranquilized like a horse or else I‚Äôll fight it all night. The fact I went to multiple doctors and begged to be reevaluated blows my mind. So many psychs just took my bipolar diagnosis and refused to look at it differently because they felt I was in a state of mania. No. All those psych meds were causing more of a lack of emotional regulation. I have never been more stable. I can go months without even a slight breakdown and any breakdown now is so tiny."
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?",You‚Äôre welcome and good luck. I don‚Äôt find that Wellbutrin helps me with anxiety or paralysis though.
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","I am keeping my buspar the same, but I stopped the wellbutrin to try auvelity! It‚Äôs a super new antidepressant that combines bupropion (wellbutrin) with dextromethophan (a cough suppressant, interestingly enough). My dr said we might still supplement with wellbutrin though because I was taking 450 mg of wellbutrin and now I‚Äôm only getting 210 mg from the auvelity. I love wellbutrin but if I can take a lower dose to mitigate the annoying side effects, then I‚Äôll do it"
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","This is such a big win, I'm so happy for you! Yeah, the adaptation to meds is hell... I'm still getting used to Concerta after I stopped it for some weeks."
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","Omg yes, staying 5 hours in bed without sleeping is like my life right now! It's so freaking awful!"
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","Focusing is good but right now I'm more worriesmd about the anxiety associated with ADHD and executive dysfunction/ADHD paralysis more tgan anything. You can't have problems focusing if you can't stop doom-scrolling on to couch all day, and when I tried Vyvance (I'm on Concerta rn) I would hyperfocus on doom-scrolling!"
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?",Everyone‚Äôs different. I have had a bad few months upping my sertraline and then reducing it totally‚Ä¶ but it seems like 50mg is my sweet spot. It also apparently helps adderall work better.
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?",You‚Äôre welcome! Just woke up at 7 after taking my meds at 5:30 and I‚Äôm fresh as a daisy! It works! (Vyvanse 50mg)
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","Yeah, I'm feeling more confident on giving it a try then! Thank you! It sure does take a lot of trial and error, it's exhausting..."
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?",When I get access to better health professionals I can ask!
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?",Sorry for the word vomit. üòÇüòÇ oops
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","It's not word vomit, and I relate deeply. Years going to a Bipolar specialist, I spent so much money! 150 dollars the appointment/hour, paid for an year and when I told him I thought I was not Bipolar he wanted to douple Seroquel because I was clearly delirious (I never ever had a psychotic episode). It's crazy, being AFAB people wouldn't assume you're ADHD, I had several (mis)diagnoses but Ritalin/Concerta were the only meds that made me feel actually better!

And... Seroquel. I went through a Fentanyl withdrawal, I took 3 patches after a surgery, and way too much morphine and lemme tell you... Seroquel withdrawal was WORSE than that. I wanted to unalive. And the doctor left, so I was on my own weaning off of it. Now I can see I was sleepy and drugged all the time, I couldn't feel emotions.

I have running thoughts, anxiety, a constant and loud inner stream of thought and I can hyperfocus and I have no idea how several doctors decide that's 'mania'. My emotions fluctuate, yeah, because I'm anxious and at the brink of crying all the time without meds."
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?",What side effects did you get?
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?",Good point! I would definitely talk to your provider about your concerns. Perhaps there‚Äôs a better option with less risk.
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?",It really is. And it can be expensive too! I spent $600 last year on medications alone üíÄ but once I found the right combo it was worth it. Good luck!
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?",I question this ALL the time!!! My biggest complaint was that my brain ‚Äúnever shut up‚Äù. Looking back now it makes me so sad. I was constantly overwhelmed by how fast everything seemed to move. I went through this weird period for about a year and a half where I couldn‚Äôt function. All I did was work but I couldn‚Äôt clean my room. I couldn‚Äôt cook food. Everything felt impossible except going to work. I had mountains of trash and junk in my room. I had some mood fluctuations but it was primarily from being overwhelmed. I can‚Äôt believe I almost lost my life numerous times because doctors just wouldn‚Äôt listen. I was in such a low spot. When I did get the energy to clean it was too overwhelming. I love my psych now and I would do just about anything to keep him. I can actually function. I have complete control. It‚Äôs amazing.
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","For me, wellbutrin made me dehydrated, including dry mouth and dehydration headaches (they feel a certain way for me so I recognize them). Which sucks because I live in a desert. It also increased my metabolism and decreased my appetite, so I‚Äôm slightly underweight currently. I know these sound pretty bad lol but now that I‚Äôm on a lower dose of bupropion, I kind of feel like it was worth it. My focus is so terrible now. I can‚Äôt believe I used to live like this. And even when I was on the 450 mg wellbutrin it wasn‚Äôt great but it was something at least"
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?","I'm still looking for a good doctor, it gives me hope that people actually finds one eventually."
"Stimulants and Bupropion/Wellbutrin, did you ever tried both?",I really hope you find a good combination that works with you ASAP. I'll try the Bup... If it fails at least I tried.

I can't take both because they both increase blood pressure and heart rate and I already take blood pressure medication for an over-active thyroid. I'm a bit worried, because I love my bupropion!

But I discovered if I take it when I‚Äôm skipping my concerta, I feel like I can really live and work without the stimulant. So much better than not taking anything.

Hope that maybe is some helpful insight for you. I‚Äôve tired Wellbutrin too, didn‚Äôt work for me it made me feel so funny"

Did the anxiety side effect of Wellbutrin go away?,"I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs different for everyone but I will say that when I was prescribed Wellbutrin and took it for a few weeks, I became sooooo neurotic and anxious. It never got better, only worse.. like ideation worse. When I started getting rashes from it I stopped. 

I couple years after I tried it again and it was the same reaction. 

Just pay attention to your thoughts and feelings. If it is getting worse I would definitely go back to the Dr. asap."

I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,"I'm currently on wellbutrin while we are waiting for answers on other health concerns. And it's...different.

It's not an SSRI, but it blocks the dopamine and norepinephrine receptors and makes the body produce more. It's more of an off-label treatment of it.

And it takes a while to kick in. Wellbutrin can take everything from 2-4 weeks to kick in.

Every doctor/psychiatrist is different, but most of them are not trying to gatekeep you away from Ritalin or other meds. They are trying to see what symptoms remains when they've treated the most severe of them.

Depression and anxiety is common with ADHD, but can also be confused. So before she does a misscall, she wants to try it out. If it doesnt work, then it doesnt work. And you will continue therapy while exploring other options and/or treatments.

My psych didnt wanna go the ADHD with me either at first, but as we treated depression and anxiety he continued to see the same patterns and behaviours. And after consulting with a peer he landed on a ADHD diagnosis.

I had/have anxiety and depression, not as severe. But they are more present cause of my ADHD.  
Hang in there, and take one step at a time.

If you are unsure about the psychs motive you can always be honest with them and ask, or share your concerns. It took a lot of me to do it, but I got a more clear answer. And a better understanding/respect for my psych because of me asking and being honest with him."
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,"I‚Äôve taken Wellbutrin for the past two years now. I was put on it for depression. Like every medication, it has its side effects. When I first started taking it and any time my dose has been upped it‚Äôs significantly affected my appetite. It feels like there‚Äôs a knot in my throat and eating anything makes it feel worse. That feeling goes away after a few months, but it is annoying. It does increase my anxiety. I‚Äôve gotten better at controlling that thanks to CBT and limiting caffeine. Wellbutrin causes a specific brain fog where I‚Äôll have trouble recalling a word I want to say. 

However, I‚Äôm still on this medication because it helps me. I find it to be more tolerable than SSRIs. SSRIs made me feel disassociated enough to not be fully suicidal, but also I felt like a shell of myself. With Wellbutrin I still feel like I have my personality‚úÖ and I wish to die a lot less‚úÖ. I find Wellbutrin to be more forgiving in the times I‚Äôve forgotten a dose compared to SSRIs.As far as helping my ADHD goes‚Ä¶ It helps my mood, which then helps boost my motivation to accomplish tasks. I notice minimal to change to my ability concentrate, but I‚Äôm less impulsive. I now take Ritalin in addition to the Wellbutrin. I find both to be helpful, but Ritalin does far more for my ability to focus. 

You will find nightmare stories of any antidepressant and you‚Äôll hear other people swear the same one saved their life. It‚Äôs different for everyone."
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,"Wellbutrin was horrible for me, but I'm still glad I tried it... A lot of people with ADHD take wellbutrin succesfully, you just won't know if you are one of them unless you try.

It is true that it is hard to diagnose ADHD when you also suffer from depression. Symptomes are often similar. 

Wellbutrin can be taken together with ADHD medication (it often is), so it's a smart anti depressant to try if you have ADHD and depression."
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,Wellbutrin has been fantastic for my depression and is one of the few depression meds I can use without side effects. That being said I still need two other medicines to wrangle my adhd.
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,[deleted]
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,"You have to embarrass the process of elimination.

""reviews of this..."" - bro this isn't an iPhone. Most reedit articles are negative about every drug because that's the only time people complain is when its not working. You don't get reviews for when it is working."
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,"I'm still trying to figure out the right medication for myself, so can't really say anything on the medication part.

But for the comorbidity between depression, anxiety and ADHD I can add something. I've suffered from depression and anxiety for over 13 years now and just got diagnosed with ADHD this year. My therapist, the one of the 3 doctors involved (besides my GP and psychiatrist), that knows me the best, was very skeptical when I told him that I suspect that I have ADHD. And I do somehow feel my psychiatrist would be very cautious, too. Wasn't able to talk to him since then, my last appointment was done by a substitute. But both, the substitute psychiatrist and my therapist said, that they aren't experts in the topic of ADHD.

Luckily I was a patient at a university clinic because of a clinical trial. The leading professor was able to get me an appointment with the leading doctor in the department specialized in ADHD. But he also said that it's hard to diagnose it with a current depressive episode and that it's important that I bring school diplomas. I did and the doctor did pretty quickly say that it's obvious I had it as a child. I then told him all the things that I think might be caused by ADHD in my adult life. He wrote everything down and later he called and said that it's certain that I have ADHD, I just masked very well and he even thought I might have holding back in the assessment. 

Long story short: It was important to get to a doctor who is specialized in ADHD, since the others would've likely dismissed it. Or at least get a second or third opinion from other doctors."
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,Love it and feel like it helps clear my thoughts but I still take ritalin for adhd symptoms
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,"wellbutrin helped me a ton when i first got on it. around 2 weeks in, i definitely had the revelation that people talk about with other adhd meds where i could just do things and function like everyone else seems to. it isn‚Äôt working for me anymore (several years later) but it made a huge difference at first so i think it‚Äôs worth a try. i don‚Äôt think it made my anxiety worse either."
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,"I'm on Wellbutrin XL 300 mg, and I find it massively helpful for my depression and anxiety. The only side effect I've noticed took a long time to make itself obvious, and that was hair loss, which my doctor says I can treat with OTC Rogaine or something."
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,"I also had a positive experience with Wellbutrin. I was taking a combination of Paxera and Wellbutrin, but at times, I took each separately. It‚Äôs important to note that everyone‚Äôs experience is unique, and I can only speak about my own. I didn‚Äôt experience any adverse side effects with Wellbutrin; it was a positive experience. It significantly improved my mood and helped regulate my sleep. Before, I used to sleep for 12 hours a day, but with Wellbutrin, I could get a solid 8 hours of rest. It provided me with the energy to get out of bed and be more organized. My roommate used to complain about my messiness, but that changed with Wellbutrin. Additionally, it had a positive impact on my sex life. Unfortunately, I eventually had to switch to Strattera because Wellbutrin alone wasn‚Äôt sufficient to manage my ADHD. While it did help to some extent, I now realize how much ADHD affected my life, and I‚Äôd say that Wellbutrin improved my ADHD symptoms by about 30% compared to what Strattera does."
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,"This is what was told to me, too. Treat the depression first and then the ADHD. If you can get through the side effects of wellbutrin it can be a great drug if it fits with you. I've been on it for 3 months. I'm not experiencing as much seasonal depression as I normally would this time of the year. I'm generally more interested in things that I used to be interested in, and my mood is noticeably better. People in my life have said so. I find myself laughing way more. 

It did not help with my inattention or hyperactivity. It did help with memory a bit, I think. 

The worst side effect of wellbutrin is sleep issues imo. It can mess with many other areas of your life."
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,"So I was put on Wellbutrin about a month ago and it has REALLY helped me. I have depression and ADHD and I cannot believe it took me this long to go on meds. I used to be on Ritalin/ Concerta but it made me an emotionless zombie who couldn‚Äôt bare the thought of eating food whilst on the meds.. but that was ages ago during school days. 

Fast forward 12 years later and having not been on any meds, my mental well-being was regressing to a point of no return until Wellbutrin. It‚Äôs helped with my depression but also helped tremendously with my ADHD. It didn‚Äôt take long for it to work - roughly 10 days to 2 weeks. Two things to be aware of is that it causes weight loss unlike most drugs that cause weight gain. 2. It can cause acne especially if you are prone to it‚Ä¶"
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,"FWIW At least for me, it does help a little bit. It's like getting a low background level of nicotine, to make a weird comparison. 

You could always just stop taking it if you don't like it. For me at least, this mild bump was something I felt almost immediately. I knew pretty fast."
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,"In theory it should work since it affects the same neurotransmitters as ADHD meds do....but too much weaker extent.


I take brand name Wellbutrin along with my Biphentin (extended release methylphenidate in Canada) and Ritalin IR and I notice a slight prolong ""boost""."
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,"Wellbutrin was great for my depression, but it did absolutely nothing for my ADHD. Everyone is different though!"
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,"People who it didn't work for are a lot louder than people it did work for. I know a LOT of people who are on Wellbutrin successfully

Wellbutrin and lamictal make a great combination, definitely worth a try"
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,I started on Wellbutrin last year and it‚Äôs been life changing. I noticed a difference within two days. While it didn‚Äôt help with executive dysfunction it made my depression and anxiety non existent. I also take adderall xr and the combo works great for me.
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,"I was on wellbutrin for depression and adhd. It helped a little. Almost immediately, motivation and energy increased, and then little things like not needing to have the tv on at all hours. It did not help me enough on the adhd front, so my doc added Vyvanse, which was a significant improvement. 

I did have enough side effects from wellbutrin that I  recently discontinued. Anxiety was already an issue, but it got worse. I also had significant hair loss and brain fog‚Ä¶ and loss of appetite, but I‚Äôm not complaining about that one. 

Worth trying for sure. It helps a lot of people, and many use it in combo with targeted adhd meds. Good luck!"
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,"I‚Äôve been on 150mg Wellbutrin, 20mg Adderall XR and 2x10 Adderall IR and it works great for my energy levels (tried 300 once but that + the adderall made me start to get manic). When I was just getting treated for depression, there was a tiiiny bit of a kick to the prefrontal cortex, but not much. I had the motivation to do stuff, but hadn‚Äôt the wherewithal to point that motivation in any useful direction.

If you start up on it, be prepared for brain zaps. It‚Äôs known to increase blood pressure and anxiety, if that‚Äôs an issue for you (I mean, it is for me, but it died down after abt half a year). On the other hand, though, I lost  a lot of weight, it triplicates the effects of alcohol, and it‚Äôs‚Ä¶great for your sex life lol"
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,Exact same thing happened to me. Ended up going to a place specialized in ADHD and turns out I was right. Now I'm taking ritalin but just stared a couple of months ago.
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,"This sounds just like my experience, except I don‚Äôt have anxiety or depression. I think it is standard to rule out both of those by treating them first before prescribing stimulants for ADHD. I would give it a try if nothing else, to rule it out. If it works though, congratulations finding a meditation that‚Äôs easy to get. For me personally, it gave me really bad brain fog and basically made all my ADHD symptoms worse. Don‚Äôt feel like you have to keep taking it if you have side effects that are a safety hazard"
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,"Honestly, Wellbutrin literally changed my life. It does increase blood pressure which I take medication for, but that's really the only negative side effect. I can literally just...do things now. My depression is basically gone and it has helped my ADHD, but I am on a pretty low dose. But really, it was so worth it. Everyone is different so it could just not be for you. You'll figure it out. Just be patient."
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,"i‚Äôm currently on adderall xr 20mg and wellbutrin 300mg. before starting the wellbutrin (like a little less than 3 months ago) i was only taking adderall xr 30mg. i decided to lower the adderall to 20mg due to the side effects of the 30mg (i had been on this particular dose for 10+ years and was scared of changing lol) and add something else, so my doctor and i decided to try wellbutrin first alongside the adderall.

i started with the wellbutrin at 150mg, but i noticed a lot of aggression with it, which really made me nervous to up the dose since it wasn‚Äôt doing anything for my adhd. I stayed on it for about a month before i decided it wasn‚Äôt working. i felt like the adderall was doing all the work tbh and then after not even like 6 hours my focus would be elsewhere.

while taking the wellbutrin at 300mg, i‚Äôve noticed increased anxiety, like a lot (i get anxious from the adderall anyways, but it‚Äôs more noticeable now with the 300mg). the aggression doesn‚Äôt seem to be as bad on the 300mg, but i‚Äôve only been on the 300mg for about 2 weeks now. although i was really nervous about upping the dose, i‚Äôm glad i did because this could be what works best for me. after how the 150mg made me act, i was honestly ready to go straight to the strattera tho lol 

for me personally, i do struggle with noticing if it‚Äôs actually working or what side effects i‚Äôm experiencing since most of it is what i‚Äôve been dealing with when taking the adderall. my attention and focus seem to be a little better on the 300, but the anxiety never goes away. i‚Äôm thinking of staying on the 300mg for a little longer and if it doesn‚Äôt work i‚Äôll be switching to strattera with the adderall 

sorry for the long post, but hopefully this helps a bit for perspective :)"
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,"Molecules are really a hit or miss. We are all so different. I think the best is to try the molecule and see. Maybe keep a journal of any intrusive thoughts, new or modified anxiety and talk to someone if you develop self harm thoughts."
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,Just try it and find out whether it works :)
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,"I personally thought wellbutrin helped mildly with ADHD symptoms.  It didn't do much for focus per se, but definitely improved motivation/executive function.  

Adderall has been 100% more effective in terms of treating ADHD for me, but Wellbutrin was certainly better than nothing."
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,"I was similarly put on Wellbutrin before starting the ADHD evaluation process. It lowered my anxiety and my depression-like symptoms, with no negative side effects. It did not affect my ADHD symptoms at all. It helped me emotionally through the long evaluation process, as well as helping my psychiatrist to conduct the evaluation. I have no regrets. (I was eventually diagnosed with ADHD.)"
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,"I was on it for just about 2 years and it did literally nothing for my ADHD, and hardly anything for my anxiety / depression.  Other than initial weight gain, I can‚Äôt say that it had side effects‚Ä¶it just didn‚Äôt *do* anything."
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,"Wellbutrin/bupropion has been amazing for me. It's helped with my depression, adhd, And even anxiety! 
I've had relatively very little side effects too. 
Everyone is different and can have different experiences/reactions to medications.

Edit: I'm on 150mg xl (extended release)"
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,"Like with any medication, it'll be different from person to person.

I (22F) was diagnosed with anxiety at 17 and I'm now 22 and have been diagnosed with ADHD.

I recently got Wellbutrin added to my Zoloft 100mg as I was feeling numb and depressed. The adjustment period of like, 4 weeks was difficult and emotional, full of ups and downs. But I'm so glad I did it because I do feel more like myself now and I have more energy to do things.

The side effects I had were dry mouth and sweating but they seem to have slowly gone away.

I've been recently diagnosed with ADHD and am looking to add something to improve my focus because right now my procrastination and ability to concentrate on boring tasks is just awful. So in that respect, Wellbutrin didn't help that aspect of my ADHD but I don't believe it's supposed to.

I'm just waiting for my next appointment to discuss that with my psych."
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,"I took Wellbutrin for depression. I had a psych that had me on Adderall and then when I got insurance and switched to a new psych, he didn't think I had ADHD and upped my Wellbutrin to the max and added lamictal. While it doesn't work as well without the Adderall it's still better than not taking anything at all (for me). The combo was great for my depression though!"
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,Been on Wellbutrin lamotragine and adderall. With therapy and all that. My life is still chaos and I‚Äôm just as terrible at life as I was before. üòÇ
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,"It might work it might not the biggest thing with this shit is that they downplay the risk of seizures and the amount that it lowers seizure threshold. It 99% will lower your seizure threshold, whether or not this develops into an actual seizure is another story but the odds of ending up having a seizure with this medication as a contributor is alot higher then the 1 in 1000 they claim it to be."
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,"I was put on it a couple years ago, didnt work for me. Just got horrible anxiety from it. Got panic attacks that wouldnt stop all day and i couldnt do anything, just sat on the couch.

But after i quit it i met a very stupid psychologist during my eval. that said because it didnt work for me i couldnt have adhd, he was about to not send me further into my eval. process because of it.

But because i had more problems pointing towards adhd than not, they did it anyway. I suspect it wasnt really his decision to make on his own.

I now, after 2 years of evaluation, finally have my adhd diagnosis and just got put on concerta. Let me tell you... what a difference! 

The thing is, if you have too much noradrenaline in your body, it can cause you to have anxiety. If you then get put on wellbutrin on top of that, it can have disastrous effects like it did for me. In my case, im guessing my noradrenaline levels arent the problem and they are probably already on the higher side because i already had alot of anxiety when i was unmedicated. Wellbutrin does increase your dopamine levels though so if you have low noradrenaline levels and low dopamine levels it can work well for you.

No she doesnt need to treat the depression first. Adhd could be what is causing your depression in the first place!! Stand your ground, and if your doctor is a total dick abt it i would consider finding someone else.

Doctors can be real assholes when it comes to adhd, they treat us like we're the scum of the earth"
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,"So you already take two meds for anxiety and depression, and she still wants to treat your depression to see if you have ADHD. So what‚Äôs she treating then in the first place? This makes no sense to me. If you‚Äôre treated for depression and anxiety and your ADHD is still very much present then I don‚Äôt see why you‚Äôre not treated for ADHD. It could very well be causing your depression and especially anxiety. I‚Äôve commented this before on another thread, but ADHD is ‚Äúeasy‚Äù to treat. Take a stimulant and see if your symptoms get better. Instead of waiting months and jumping between different SSRIs and others and dealing with horrible side effects while STILL suffering from ADHD. I have no idea how and why these psychiatrists are so hesitant to start stimulants and would rather cause often long lasting effects with SSRIs. What ADHD symptoms do you have? Have you had these for a long time? 

Wellbutrin did nothing for anxiety or ADHD. It maybe helped me be less sleepy and sex felt better. That‚Äôs about it."
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,"I've been taking Wellbutrin XR 300 mg for years. I actually started it to quit smoking . I never went back to smoking and I smoked 2 packs a day. I also take Prozac and trileptal. I've been on Adderall 40mg too for many years. When  I wasn't taking Adderall I felt like the Wellbutrin was helping . I've been looking for Adderall for a few weeks now but everyone is out. I am going to ask my Dr to raise my Wellbutrin to 450mg. I think it would be good for you to at least try the Wellbutrin. As far as I know there isn't a shortage or threat of a shortage for that medicine.  Sometimes Adderall makes me jumpy and the Dr has told me Wellbutrin is off label treatment for ADHD that may be sensitive to stimulants.
Good luck!!"
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,"I take 300mg of wellbutrin and 20mg of ritalin everyday with FOOD important af or ur tummy will wanna die. but it‚Äôs helped me so much. i used to have to nap or sleep for hours before anything IF i felt up to leaving my room. i can always tell when i miss it, bc i start feeling internally tired and dreadful hahahaha. consistency is key and make sure to always be honest with ur psychiatrist if something isn‚Äôt working or you need more of it!"
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,How is it going for you two months later? You still on buproprion?
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,thank u for sharing your experiences with wellbutrin. yeah i‚Äôll definitely try it and see how it goes but i‚Äôm just concerned because my depression and anxiety i feel is a side effect of my adhd. i hope i have some positive results though :)
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,"Thank god someone else gets that brain fog too. If I don't take it, i am depressed and don't get anything done. And when i take it, the brain fog makes it hard to focus on tasks that are boring. 

Loose loose situation for me.

The main reason I take it is that it stabilizes my mood. Without it I am a cu*t. 

I might need stimulants, getting my verdict of the adhd tests next week."
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,The ‚Äúknot‚Äù could be an enlarged thyroid gland. That happens with both hypo- and hyper-thyroidism.
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,"yeah, the thing i‚Äôm concerned about is that i‚Äôve already been on depression medication for a long time now and it‚Äôs been working. i just feel like my adhd is causing symptoms similar to depression and anxiety. i‚Äôll try the wellbutrin though and see how it goes, thank you :)"
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,"okay thank you for the warning :) and i appreciate the feedback, i‚Äôm starting on 150mg so hopefully i notice some effects eventually"
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,i could have maybe used a better phrase than review yeah. i‚Äôve been on a lot of meds before and i‚Äôve looked up what people have said and usually it‚Äôs pretty good. but i only asked this post because wellbutrin seemed to have a lot of negative comments on it. hope that makes sense
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,"Yes. You do. There's plenty of positive reviews about the life changing effects of Adderall, Vyvanse, escitalopram and the like."
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,Its more than likely the adderral that has changed ur life. I say this bc I too have tried several antidepressants and anti anxiety before i got my adderral back and the adhd meds is what took me out of my depression and anxiety. But luke they say everyones different.
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,"Wellbutrin gave you brain zaps starting the medication, not coming off it?"
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,"yea it‚Äôs frustrating and my therapist is frustrated with my psychiatrist as well. i‚Äôve had adhd symptoms since i was little pretty much. fidgeting 24/7. thoughts are slipping away constantly and forgetting what i wanted to do or say. forgetting to listen to someone talking. being unable to stay organized no matter how many journals or methods i try to keep up with. impulsivity. i remember when i was like 9, instead of keeping 5 separate color coded folders like everyone else for each class, mine eventually combined into one giant folder that was falling apart. 

yeah. i need help lol"
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,"Laughing a bit now since i didnt see this until now. I was until last week of November after tests from the cardiologist came back negative. Im back on my 20+10mg of Ritalin. But we're continuing on bupropion with 150mg as well. Feel great, but getting back on Ritalin again really helped with things again. Wellbutrin kept me afloat. But Ritalin pulled me out of the water."
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,"Here to say wellbutrin helps with my ADHD too! Specifically, I find it helps ""buffer"" the effects of hormonal fluctuations throughout my menstrual cycle, which typically make my ADHD exponentially worse. The week before/during my period I was pretty much incapable of functioning, even with my ADHD meds I was pretty much out of commission for over a week every single month. Now that I'm back on 150 XL, it's like a night-and-day difference. Don't know if that's a scenario that applies to you, but just wanted to give another ""success"" story!

Meds work so differently for everyone, so there's no way to know for certain how they'll affect you. If you decide to try the wellbutrin, I'd recommend talking with your psychiatrist about a ""contingency plan"" if you find the side effects to be unbearable.

I've been in the situation before where new meds were absolutely wrecking me and I wanted to taper off, but I just could NOT get in touch with my psych/psych wouldn't respond for days/weeks so I was left feeling really miserable. Thankfully, I have a psychiatrist now who is very responsive - every time I start a med/increase a dose, I ask her what exactly to do if I find the side effects intolerable and she gives me instructions for safely getting off of them (how exactly to taper off, which ones are safe to stop ""cold-turkey"", etc.) in the event I can't get ahold of her right away. If you're really worried about the effects of the wellbutrin, it might be worth talking to your doctor about something like this

Good luck, I hope you can find what works for you!"
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,"I don't know where you're looking, but practically every psych med under the sun will have some people who hate it and can't tolerate it at all, and some people whose lives have been saved by it. There's really no way to know how it will work for you until you try it. 

If you're really concerned about the side effects, you can tell you doctor this, and maybe there's another option. But with psych meds the side effects will usually vary for every individual as well. The most severe side effects are usually fairly uncommon. Every med you try comes with the risk of unpleasant side effects."
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,Yeah. Kind of worrying for me since I‚Äôve never had them with any other medicine. Maybe it depends on the generic brand?
I g√≥t put on Wellbutrin,"Hm yeah interesting that she‚Äôs still not willing to prescribe an actual medicine for ADHD. are you able to see someone else? I had to switch two psychs until I finally started making progress. Shockingly, my anxiety went away on stimulants. How they don‚Äôt get this still idk"

ADHD and Wellbutrin ( bupropion ) How has it helped? ,"I have GAD as well as ADHD so my Wellbutrin was what I started after being on Zoloft for years. It didn't really help my ADHD symptoms but I think it has helped my anxiety and responses that are related to and caused by my ADHD symptoms. For instance, I would get emotionally overwhelmed a ton before I started on Wellbutrin. If I couldn't focus on a college homework assignment and absorb the information immediately, I was at risk of shutting down. Now with Wellbutrin, it's a bit easier to breathe through those break downs and emotional responses - but I've also gone through about 6 or 7 years of therapy that I started going to because of those breakdowns. Adderall has been what has helped me avoid the triggering events in the first place because it allowed me to focus on one instruction or question at a time rather than seeing it as a huge blob of information that I felt I could never dissect.

I don't think Wellbutrin really did anything for my ADHD other than that emotional stabilization - I'd like to think of it as damage control honestly. For me, it didn't treat the focus part but it did help with the emotional part."
ADHD and Wellbutrin ( bupropion ) How has it helped? ,"It lessened the lows (and the highs) so that I can stay engaged for more of the day. But it doesn't really treat ADHD.

ADHD and Wellbutrin ( bupropion ) How has it helped? ,Wellbutrin helped me with the depression and snacking.

ADHD and Wellbutrin ( bupropion ) How has it helped? ,wellbutrin does nothing for my adhd personally
ADHD and Wellbutrin ( bupropion ) How has it helped? ,"Diagnosed recently with PI-ADHD & was on Wellbutrin for 6 months. The first day I took it, I felt nothing. The second day when I woke up. I had the urge to do something, ended up having breakfast & started a coding task.

I never in my life felt calm until the 3rd/4th days of Wellbutrin. Damn, my head was just so calm and had pleasure doing things back. My social anxiety lifted, socializing was enjoyable to me. I was on 150mg XL. I quit it recently because it somewhat impaired my memory and lost the effectiveness after 4 months

It also puts you in a normal state between highs and lows. Lows doesnt affect much. I dont know how to explain but it feels like, every problem has a solution

Keep in mind - Wellbutrin has a honeymoon phase which can last up to 2 weeks, don't be surprised with 'it stopped working', it can take up to 8 weeks to fully build into your body and it's a non stim so if you see no effectiveness after 8 weeks tell your doctor"

"Was just denied going back on stimulants because ""adults only take stimulant ADHD medication for the euphoric high they provide, just like meth or other steet drugs"".","Alright, here we go...

If this is genuinely what happened, then you need to absolutely look for another primary care provider as there is an alarming amount of unethical and unprofessional behavior. They should have their practice investigated if this is their policy and stance for those in your situation. First of all, you have a history of taking the medication already, so the whole implied idea that it's not appropriate because ""it's a controlled substance"" is bullshit. You didn't have it discontinued previously because you were abusing it, so I want to know why they think this is justification for denying you the medication. It's unethical to withhold treatment that clearly was helping you. Secondly, hypertension can be addressed through therapeutic means via dietary and lifestyle modifications, regular exercise and physical activity, getting adequate rest, and stress reduction along with addition of medications like a beta blocker which directly antagonizes the effect of the increased circulation of catecholamines due to the stimulant's pharmacodynamics. What they should have done is have you monitor, document, and report any episodes of sustained hypertension upon restarting the medication (your body will readjust, so it shouldn't be an issue as long as you take the medication consistently) and reassess from that point. The Wellbutrin is a sympathomimetic amphetamine analog, so it would pose a risk of increasing your heart rate and blood pressure as well. If they say, ""well, it's not as BAD as the adderall,"" then they need to consider that Wellbutrin could just not work AT ALL or well enough which means that it would be just as effective or helpful on their part to do nothing at all. In fact, it could be one of the worst things for you, and they're putting you at risk by refusing to treat you with medication that has had an extremely high success rate in helping you manage your ADHD. At this point, I would've just asked for their credentials because they need to make like the Wellbutrin and find an alternate career or profession. If they're doing this with you, I can't imagine what they're doing with other patients. I'm not kidding when I say these people need to be looked into...

I am extremely outraged by this as a medical professional, and I am embarrassed that these people have failed to adequately, appropriately treat you. These are stigmatic and outdated practices on their part, and I can tell you there is this misperception that the ADHD does not lead to SERIOUS FUNCTIONAL PROBLEMS! That is NOT supported whatsoever by decades long research on the long term impact of not treating ADHD (as well as following cohorts of individuals receiving appropriate treatment). They are literally failing to do their job as one of your providers by not advocating for the medically indicated treatment. It is unjust and unethical in our modern medical world. It is misguided to not allow you to receive the appropriate medical treatments. It is routine for medical providers to check their state's prescription monitoring program(s) which they can see if you are receiving any other controlled substances. So, no, you aren't a drug seeker. Routine urine drug screens can EASILY assess whether or not an individual is using other substances as well as whether you are taking the prescribed medication. With that being said, I wouldn't waste my time with these clowns one more second. Find a different provider, have them transfer your records to the new provider's practice, and get the help you deserve. These people are horrible.

It's kind of like a credit score, and it gets worse depending on which/how many drugs you've had to buy in the past.

This is mainly about people seeking opioid treatment, but it would make sense if the same system also restricts access to other drugs with high abuse potential, like adhd meds. It could explain why they suddenly pivoted to treating you like a drug-seeker if there are no other reasons for them to think that.

That is totally infuriating I am sure, and finding a new place to go is absolutely the way to go. And interactions like that are worse for people with ADHD, because most of us have rejection sensitivity issues. 

In regards to meds...
First thing my doctor tried to perscribe me was Welbutrin also. It did nothing. It isn't even an ADHD med, just is perscibed off label because it sometimes has some effect on ADHD. But the effect size is nowhere close to stimulants, and not even enough to be approved as an ADHD drug. But see for me, that was before I had an official ADHD diagnosis. So okay fine, whatever. Its like their secret way to see if you just have depression or anxiety, which is like doctors favorite thing to misdiagnose people with ADHD with.

Strattera is the only actual non-stimulant medication that is actually for ADHD. That really should be the first thing they should try, if you are diagnosed with ADHD and stimulants are off the table. Its effect in studies is supposed to be near stimulants, but I think just a little bit less. I'm actually on that now. Issues are, it makes lots of people feel nauseous and takes a while for your stomach to get used to it. And doctors constantly under dose it. Unless you are in the 10% of people who have the gene to metabolize it super slow, you need a pretty high dose for it to do anything. In studies that show it working, people are getting 80-120mg. I see comments all over reddit ""took 40mg of Strattera for a year and it did nothing."" Ya no kidding, after a month or two you should've been on double that dose.

So anyway I wouldn't waste your time on Welbutrin. But if when you switch doctors, you can't get stimulants to work for you. Strattera should be next. Its pretty tough to get that one right tho, so definitely read up on how to lessen nausea and try to stick with it long enough to get an effective dose."

It was a weird time when I was diagnosed, it was pretty much exactly when everyone hopped aboard the medicating adhd kid train and I was in 3rd grade. Within a year I was up to 80 mg of Adderall XR. I left it to try some other meds my senior year of highschool I think and then when I ruled out alot of other ones, I tried to go back to it and they were telling me I was going back because I was addicted.

6 months without any medication when 80 mg was what I needed to hold focus in a classroom, and I almost flunked out of school getting academic suspension for a semester, then they put me back on but I needed a drug test every 3 months and random ones happened too. They also called me when I refilled 2 days early because I know I wouldn't have time 2 days later and asked me if I was selling drugs and informing me if my drug test came back without Adderall then I would be cut off of it and if it because I'm either selling or abusing it. Then to her suprise, I changed to vyvance and a different doctor.

That doctor got me Vyvanse in a few min, and asked me if I was sure about getting off Adderall because it had som good effects but I wanted to see if a change helped with some of the symptoms.

Oh, yes I shouldn't judge people bec, naw she was an idiot. If she knew a damned thing about what she was supposed to know about she'd know that was wrong. This is a medication that was prescribed to you, it was taken off because of genuine medical concerns over blood pressure. Wanting to try the medication again despite blood pressure issues (taking extra steps to keep the blood pressure under control) isn't drug seeking. It's wanting to try a medication for your genuine medical condition that is known to work for it, that you yourself know worked best of those things you have already tried.

That your therapist was ok with all of this is also horrible. He should not be allowing his patient to be accused in this manner. You have a diagnosis, you want to get treatment, instead he was ok with putting his patient in harm's way. He's not putting the needs of his patients first, he's cowing to his boss. Doesn't matter how easy it is to talk to him, he does not have your best interest at heart if he was ok with this happening. You need to let him know he failed you, he can maybe do better if he learns from this, but he's either agreeing with her, in which case fuck him. Or he just is fine with allowing harm to his patients because eh, it's not like it's happening to him and he'd like to avoid conflict.

I no longer have a problem letting people know if they're failing me and failing at their jobs, for the simple reason that it's all that I can do anymore. They get to go home and not suffer the consequences of their ineptitude, I am the one who has to live with their incompetence or apathy. Literally the only thing I can do is let them know they failed me, not angrily, but sadly, so they know that they did me real harm. That they hurt me.

As for her assertion on the medications... well I know what happened to me when I was given too high a dose of stimulant medication. Exactly what that supervisor knows happens to drug addicts looking for a euphoric high... I fell asleep. Like, just, clonked right out. Methheads are known for that right? Taking a hit of meth and just falling right asleep. That's the stereotype right? Methheads just sleeping all the time like giant furless cats."

"Was just denied going back on stimulants because ""adults only take stimulant ADHD medication for the euphoric high they provide, just like meth or other steet drugs"".","I started smoking when I was 16. I quit several times over the next six years, but always started back within a few weeks (I think I made it a couple months once though). Right before I finally quit, I was drinking a TON too. I probably wouldn't have been successful quitting that time if it wasn't for being in a different country with different brands and cigs being super expensive for three months. I quit drinking a few months after my trip and still craved cigs and alcohol. 

Anyway...I went to a psychologist I used to go to as a kid for OCD about a year after I got back from my trip. We went through the regular new patient questions/background, she saw that I threw a couple major red flags for ADHD (something I'd never even thought about before). She tested and diagnosed me with combined-type soon after and then I started generic Adderall. (OCD turned out not to be OCD.) 

And now I've been smoke-free 2.5 years, I don't crave cigs anymore (except maybe once in the past several months), I've only had a couple drinks over the past year and a half, I  don't crave a drink anymore unless I have a drink, and I was diagnosed with ADHD and started meds a year ago. (Oh, and I don't drink caffeine anymore, but I think that's more because of how it makes me feel in combination with the meds.)

(Wow, I did NOT realize just how much of a positive effect getting diagnosed and treating my ADHD has been in terms of the above behavior. I'm pretty sure I'd still be smoking and drinking if that hadn't happened.)"

While I agree that my life was stressful, and that contributed to my issues, I also stopped smoking and drinking 9 months earlier in a joint effort with my wife to clean up our lives with her being pregnant.

13 years on, looking back, I realise that I was probably self medicating with nicotine and alcohol between the ages of 15 and 30.

I recently started vaping low nicotine juice, as an n=1 experiment, and things have improved a bit.

Now if I can just get diagnosed, I may be able to function properly for the first time. I should probably stop vaping too, even though I quite enjoy it.

Edit: in case anyone wonders, I didn't manage to complete my degree, after 3 attempts to get through my final year, I ran out of money..."

This is, genuinely, what I am afraid of facing.

As crazy as it sounds, I saved up 90 days worth of doses from back in 2019.

2020 has been very challenging to get stuff done.

I spent over a decade with my neurologist. Sadly, Kaiser told me that in order to continue getting refills through them, I had to go with their doctor.

Despite starting the process I was too uncomfortable continuing it. Call it imposter syndrome, anxiety, or whatever you might. I already spent the first 2 decades of my life struggling since my parents and I decided to avoid treatment (after diagnosis, trying meds, deciding that it was too extreme for me). The strange part about all of that is that I have a very severe case of ADHD. The drugs did very weird things to me (doc said it's because of my biochemistry...?) in my 20s I tried to seek treatment again and met a really amazing neurologist. We tried everything that we could prior to medications, I didn't want to take them. It turns out, medication made the difference despite everything else.

I don't want to go see the docs at Kaiser, I have no clue what to expect and I really fear what you just mentioned.

Not sure how many days left that I have, I feel more like a druggie trying to partition out what I have left (maybe getting 3 days to a dose, based on prior doctor recommendations) but what then?

At this point, I feel like them saying that it is drug seeking behavior is actually legitimate. Like, do I want to spend my days uselessly or actually get things that I want to get done done?

Sitting here and trying to focus on something while hearing my wife's fork scrape across the plate in another room, the air conditioner buzzing loudly away, the animals purring or chirping....

Fuck.

And I'm suppose to go see a new doctor?

I never had compulsive use for anything except adderall but then again I was prescribed to take ‚Äúas needed‚Äù. but I just used to love experimenting and definitely abused a lot things.

I have been off meds for about 5 years. I did use Xanax for a while but stopped two years ago, it actually did help with ADHD but I think it made my anxiety worse when I wasn‚Äôt taking it, and think I mostly used to to avoid things. It was a hard adjustment , but I spent the last 5 years working on it and I think my life is better now than it ever was. Although, the time on meds was probably a necessary step in getting where I am and I am grateful for that as well. I still have a lot of symptoms and it‚Äôs difficult but I get through and keep improving. I take a small amount of Adderall occasionally , less than once or twice a month or none at all, only about 1/4 of a 5 mg pill. When I took some classes a couple years ago the adderall helped on tests. Other than that I can‚Äôt take much or I‚Äôm afraid I will get dependent again, if I take it too many days in a row I will need to take it just to get off the couch then I‚Äôm stuck in hole. I mostly just trained my mind to be more efficient, but it took years and it sucked, not a lot to people are going to do that, and it‚Äôs not always an option like for kids who are in school. I also realized that I used my problems as an excuse and that helped me get through as well. Just because we have ADHD and whatever else doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt do the same things other people can, it‚Äôs just way harder to do those things and might take more time. I don‚Äôt mind though, almost anything can be done and there‚Äôs plenty of people who have done more with way less. - I do take one thing under supervision of my Dr. that is prescribed in Europe but not US but I‚Äôm not sure If I‚Äôm allowed to mention it because it‚Äôs an herbal medicine.

Strattera or Wellbutrin,"I am so blown away that your psychiatrist or psychologist can't diagnose you. I'm pretty sure your GP in the US can diagnose you also. Is that just where you live or is that just howi it's done in Canada?

As far as my experience with Strattera. From what I remember(it was 12 +yrs ago) I really didn't get to give it a fair chance. When I started off, I was nauseous for the first two weeks, then when they upped it, I began to get headaches and nausea. So I couldn't tell you if it helped with any symptoms because I couldn't concentrate or do anything due to wanting to puke or close my eyes and put my head down. 

Welbutrin changed everything for me. There were several variants and dosages SR, XL, and IR. I took them all and worked all the way up to my current dose of 300 XL √ó 1 a day. What it did really is make me present in the moment so that I could completely Focus and at the same time had the ability to easily change my focus to a different task. It did loads for my motivation and low energy. Gave me the energy I needed to get through the day (I had excessive daytime sleepiness) but I was  still able to sleep at night. It's affected my appetite quite a bit and it took me a while to get used to that. But all in all it took care of the depression and anxiety that was caused by my ADHD simply by alleviating the symptoms of it LOL

Eventually we get to a few months ago where my doctor added Adderall XR to the mix to clear up some of the brain fog that I was having. And I have to say I can't remember ever feeling this good. And I'm simply just like everybody else around me now."
Strattera or Wellbutrin,"I‚Äôm personally on Straterra and I‚Äôve had a really positive experience with it. There is going to be a delayed onset for it (around two weeks), but after that I just feel like I can get things done, and I never feel like I‚Äôm on meds the same way I did with other stimulant meds. Side effects have been very minimal for me personally. I had some issues staying asleep for the first few weeks, but that passed.

If you‚Äôre in the US, Straterra might be considered a lower tier drug by your insurance, and you might have to pay more for it than you would for a more common medication. The fact that it isn‚Äôt controlled though is very nice. It‚Äôs been a lot less of a hassle getting doctor‚Äôs to prescribe it, and I don‚Äôt have to check in with my GP nearly as often."
Strattera or Wellbutrin,"I was also given those two options. Wellbutrin works great for me. Almost not physical sensation, just boosted executive function. Atonoxetine made me feel like i was having a small panic attack all day. Your milage will very tho."
Strattera or Wellbutrin,"As far as I know, Wellbutrin is an off label medication used to treat ADHD. It‚Äôs primarily an antidepressant. Strattera is non-stimulant medication used to treat ADHD. 

In my experience, Wellbutrin was not helpful for ADHD treatment. I experienced more of a placebo affect, but after 4-5 weeks (expected time for medication to work) I felt no difference. I was misdiagnosed for depression. My depression stemmed from my ADHD and a lack of completing tasks, etc‚Ä¶ I advocated for myself and was placed on Vyvanse. I have never felt better. 

I hope you find what works for you. Self advocating is essential because no one knows your experience better than you"
Strattera or Wellbutrin,"I feel like it's because of my GP. I went to him 12 years ago with these concerns and he brushed it off as anxiety. No doubt I have anxiety too, but I feel like it stems from the issues I have with adhd. My therapist pieced it together pretty quickly and urged me to revisit it with him. He seemed mad that I even brought it up. Said everyone thinks they have adhd these days, and some other very unsupportive statements. I stood my ground this time instead of leaving in tears. So he passed it on to a referral to a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist I saw today was a locum so he's only here for 2 weeks and can't do the assessment, just the meds piece. Our health care system is in shambles, especially when it comes to mental health."
Strattera or Wellbutrin,"I'm in Canada. I have pretty good insurance, so I'm not too worried about that. Did you have to ""up"" your dosage after the initial prescription? Does it affect your weight/appetite? How is your focus, are your thoughts more linear? Overall, would you say it's made a huge difference to your quality of life? Thanks for your response :)"
Strattera or Wellbutrin,Thanks for sharing your experience: )
Strattera or Wellbutrin,"Agree. I've been advocating for myself the whole time. Had to fight for the referral to psychiatrist, as my family doctor has been very dismissive, and I feel he'll continue to be. Unfortunately, we have very few doctors and I can't be choosey. The psychiatrist mentioned he can't prescribe any stimulant drugs without the full assessment, which cannot be completed in my location. So many hurdles üò¢"
Strattera or Wellbutrin,I abused substances to cope with my depression and adhd. My psychologist refuses to try Vyvanse (or any stimulant) due to the possibility of me abusing it. I feel so trapped going through the laundry list of meds when I know what I need is the stimulant.
Strattera or Wellbutrin,"I was on concerta and later Adderall prior to the Straterra, and for me those definitely had an effect on appetite and weight. I was a very skinny kid, and I never felt like I could eat lunch. It hasn‚Äôt been a problem for me since switching, but I know it is a side effect some people get so your mileage may vary.

Focus is fine! The stims provide a ‚Äúdriven‚Äù feeling that Straterra doesn‚Äôt, but I genuinely feel like I‚Äôm mostly operating like a person without ADHD for the most part. The onset and drop off are also less well defined than the other meds I was on. If I missed a day of adderall I‚Äôd be useless, but if I miss a day of Straterra I‚Äôm still mostly functional. I‚Äôm more focused when I take it, but I‚Äôm certainly not falling back to baseline when I don‚Äôt for a day if that makes sense.

I had to up my dose a few times. It‚Äôs been a while at my current dose, but IIRC it was initially effective at the lower doses and then declined later. We eventually got to my current dose which has been stable for a few years.

Quality of life has been good! I don‚Äôt have any ADHD related complaints. The meds I switched off of were also working, but the side effects were too much to deal with. 

One other side effect I just remembered. I have to take it with food every morning or I get acid reflux. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs common, but it‚Äôs pretty easy to deal with."
Strattera or Wellbutrin,"Your doctor may put you on a progressive dose of this. I think most people need about 80mg, but one of the side effects people commonly get is nausea. I‚Äôve been doing 10mg-20mg-40mg. Only side effect has been some strange tingling in hands/feet for the first few days of the upped dose and some mild dizziness."
Strattera or Wellbutrin,Have you tried Telehealth? There are many platforms that accept insurance and can help make your diagnosis more accessible.
Strattera or Wellbutrin,Thanks so much for your helpful feedback! I really appreciate it :)
Strattera or Wellbutrin,Thank you! How long do these side effects usually last?
Strattera or Wellbutrin,"Nevermind, I see you said they last a few days! Can you still go to work? I'm a teacher."
Strattera or Wellbutrin,Only a few days for me as my body adjusts. Nothing that impedes my daily habits or work! It‚Äôs different for everyone though.
Strattera or Wellbutrin,I am a teacher too! It‚Äôs not disruptive for my work (I teach high schoolers)
Strattera or Wellbutrin,"Ok, good to know! You find it effective overall? I think I'm leaning towards Strattera over Wellbutrin..."
Strattera or Wellbutrin,"Ok! I teach kindergarten and always have to  be ""on""! So just curious."

However, I can say that I also experienced anxiety when I first started treatment. I was prescribed low dose anti-anxiety meds which I now take with it. 

Maybe that's a solution if your new medication does the same."

Does Wellbutrin or adderall impact sleep more?,"Yes welbutrin is well known to cause insomnia as a side effect, I'd imagine Adderall also would too as it's a stimulant, I'd say they are potentially as bad as each other if you're trying to sleep on them"

That side effect started to wear off about two weeks after I started taking it.  It affected my sleep in that two week span, but I took it as soon as I woke up and that helped.

 Is Dexedrine and wellbutrin safe?,"Dexedrine already basically does what Wellbutrin does and more, might be better to look into an SSRI or something else thats non-dopaminergic"
 Is Dexedrine and wellbutrin safe?,How do you find the combo so far?
Giving Wellbutrin a try.,"I was prescribed Welbutrin by my doctor while I waited to have my official assessment done. My doctor explained that it was traditionally a depression and anxiety med but that it also has shown really good results with ADHD as well. I'm not totally sure if I'm ADHD or if its trauma related (many ADHD symptoms are similar to trauma side effects), but I will say that I'm 8 weeks in to starting Welbutrin and my head has felt significantly ""quieter."" I'm very happy with it so far."
Giving Wellbutrin a try.,"ok so I was diagnosed with ADHD in 6th grade. I just started wellbutrin last july after being on an SSRI for years. Everyone is different but I can tell you how my ADHD brain felt about wellbutrin. 

to preface, I‚Äôm an anxious, insecure person with more distracted adhd (not so much hyper unless I‚Äôm in a weird environment). the anxiety and intrusive thoughts come in waves.

The first week of wellbutrin I felt incredible. literally everyday felt fantastic. after a month or so, I started getting rage episodes. I kept them in mostly but I was BITTER for like 30 minutes for no good reason sometimes. I upped my dose 6 months in, and i‚Äôve been on that ever since. i love it. I have never liked taking my stimulant meds without breaks- it hurts my mental health. the wellbutrin helps those days where I don‚Äôt take meds a lot. quite a bit of my anxiety was coming from simply not doing things, and wellbutrin helps me get over that initial hump of being too anxious to start"
Giving Wellbutrin a try.,"I hope Wellbutrin works for you. I hated it! I was mean, extreme mood swings, became an alcoholic, couldn‚Äôt sleep, night sweats, and cried at any minor inconvenience. It made me go completely insane, I hated how it made me feel so much that it‚Äôs now listed in my chart as a medication allergy. That being said, everyone responds differently to medications so I really hope that you don‚Äôt experience any of the negative side effects that I experienced."
Giving Wellbutrin a try.,"My psych was reluctant to prescribe stimulants without a formal evaluation/history of dx so wanted to try Wellbutrin first. I didn‚Äôt like it at first bc it was strange to feel so calm, even in situations where I knew I was stressed but my body wasn‚Äôt having the physical stress reaction I was used to. I realized that I‚Äôd gotten so used to a baseline of anxious panic that I assumed it was just how life was, I guess. At this point I‚Äôve gotten used to that and am starting to find a new normal. It hasn‚Äôt really helped with task initiation, but it‚Äôs been helping with task *avoidance* a lot, so as long as I‚Äôve got a routine/schedule I‚Äôve been much more able to get through my day."
Giving Wellbutrin a try.,"We collected some information about wellbutrin (bupropione).

[https://www.adxs.org/en/page/193/bupropione-for-adhd](https://www.adxs.org/en/page/193/bupropione-for-adhd)

For ADHD there are quite high doses needed. 

If someone doesn't get along with one medication that says nothing about whether it works for others. The effect of ADHD drugs is very individual. Nevertheless, from a purely statistical point of view, bupropione is quite clearly in the group of agents that should only be tried if the standards do not help."
Giving Wellbutrin a try.,"Nice, I hope wellburtion works out for you! I‚Äôve had a lot of friends who did really well in that medication."
Giving Wellbutrin a try.,The irony of ADHD books to me is that my ADHD has taken what used to be a love of reading and made it and impossible task
Giving Wellbutrin a try.,I HATED Wellbutrin. I‚Äôve never been so sad and miserable in my life. I was moody and anxious.
Giving Wellbutrin a try.,"I take Wellbutrin primarily for depression but I do happen to have ADHD as well. It helps me a lot more than Zoloft did for my depression. I‚Äôm currently on 300mg and do well but I was on 450mg for a year and I felt so focused and energized compared to normal. Everything just felt easier. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the med‚Äôs effect on ADHD or the effect on the depression or both but 450mg was my ideal dose. Two warnings though! 1-Wellbutrin could cause some anxiety especially at first, I didn‚Äôt experience that until I got upped to 300mg and then it lasted about a week, just general anxiety and difficulty sleeping (can also cause insomnia for some people if they take it too late in the day). The same anxiety occurred when my dose increased to 450mg but again it only lasted about a week. I was also prepared for it to happen and knew it was likely time limited so I was able to work through it and I‚Äôm glad I did. 2-get a daily pill sorter or something to ensure you don‚Äôt accidentally take too much. Taking over 600mg a day (of XL at least) can cause seizures. I accidentally took 2 of my 450mg pills in one day and had a seizure (the only time I‚Äôve ever had one so not something I‚Äôm prone to) and that‚Äôs why my doctor won‚Äôt let me take 450mg anymore. üôÑ"
Giving Wellbutrin a try.,It gave me major brain fog. It was one of the last medications I tried. I tried all the non-stimulants and the stimulants all made my blood pressure rise so...ugh.
Giving Wellbutrin a try.,"I was prescribed Wellbutrin about‚Ä¶a year and half ago or two years ago. I took it for several months, but at the same time I drank a lot of alcohol. I‚Äôm an alcoholic, 60 days sober today. So‚Ä¶I had it for anxiety and depression. I don‚Äôt know that it ever really did anything because I drank so much.  I‚Äôm taking lexapro now, about 2 months. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the medicine or not drinking but I don‚Äôt feel depression and as much anxiety. But I can‚Äôt concentrate now more than ever. 

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the meds or what. I‚Äôm getting screened or assessed or whatever for ADHD next week."
Giving Wellbutrin a try.,"While stimulants work well for most with ADHD, they are not a *me too* drug.  Wellbutrin seems beneficial for some, and I believe this is because ADHD isn‚Äôt strictly a dopamine disorder.  Norephedrine also plays a part, given Wellburtin can increase these levels and help with the motivation factor.  The increased NE also helps for latter life dopamine creation.

TL:DR - while stimulants are vastly superior, Wellbutrin can provide enough low-key boost to help some people.  Sadly, I am not one of them LOL."
Giving Wellbutrin a try.,"Wellbutrin has worked great for me. Watch for hair loss though. If you have ADHD they will put you on a high does & it can cause hair loss. My doctor tried to gaslight me by saying that he never heard of that side effect, even though I know two other people that suffered from the same side affect from Wellbutrin. I forced him to bump me down 50 mg and it has helped a LITTLE. But I do still have hair loss. I accepted the fact that the Wellbutrin helped me enough to not want to go off of it & cut my hair into a cute pixie cut üßö & now I feel like I baddie üíÖ so I guess it somehow worked out in the end after crying for days about my long hair falling out üòÇ"
Giving Wellbutrin a try.,"I am like at Rule 6 in the book. How was the book for you?

Can I take it with my stimulants?"
Giving Wellbutrin a try.,Update: 2 weeks on and no major improvement. I've noticed I'm a bit irritable.  Spoke with my doc today and gonna give it a few more weeks to see if I chill out or if it helps but so gar Wellbutrin hasn't done much for me.
Giving Wellbutrin a try.,"Follow up: Wellbutrin ultimately didn't do anything for me. Made me agitated and kind of mean for a week then just nothing at all.   


Talked to doctor and stopped taking it and he is going to put me on Adderall (extended-release) to see if that helps with all the symptoms."

I tried Wellbutrin for a while. Side effects were weird for me (crazy sweating, super angry out of character) and I didn't get much of a positive benefit from it. After that I landed with Strattera before wanting to try a stimulant and it's been amazing for me. There's a lot of success stories with wellbutrin and adhd folks too, it may take a little to find a fit. Glad you're excited to find what works and wish you well!"

Giving Wellbutrin a try.,I'm on it now. I think I feel more in control. I don't have side effects. I feel confident. It's a much more subtle change it seems than I expected/ wanted but I'll see as I keep using it.
Giving Wellbutrin a try.,I loved it for the first two weeks!! my psych put me on it for adhd/anxiety/depression. my brain felt quieter + it helped me avoid my crazy sugar cravings lol. after a couple weeks I got super super anxious (to the point where I was constantly scared I would faint). Waiting for a psych appt so I can add an anti anxiety med and restart it because it was GREAT at the beginning!
Giving Wellbutrin a try.,"On it now.  450 mg broken up into 2 pills that I'm taking this along with my vitamins as I type this.  Got it because the psych practicioner thought after talking to me I was dealing with more depression then anything else.  

Good news:  No severe side effects other then a bad headache each day for a few hours in the evening for about 10 when I first started. That has since gone away.  I do feel calmer and not as panicked?  But my mind still does race on occasion.  It has worked but not for....

Bad news:  It hasn't done much for the actual ADHD.  I also get really bad mental locks up where I know I need to do something and I just keep putting it off.  So that effects my work and now I want to change jobs (its a long story) and I just kept putting off looking for a new one and now its hurting me financially till I find a new one.  

I started at 150 and have since been upped to the 450.  It feels like it has helped and I've only been on the 450 dose for 9 days and I now new dosage amounts take a while to take effect so I will see."
Giving Wellbutrin a try.,I‚Äôm on a combination of Wellbutrin and adderall and I‚Äôm liking the results. Started Wellbutrin first then added the adderall. One thing to be on the lookout for is you may be more edgy or irritable for the first couple of weeks of Wellbutrin. My doctor said this was normal due to certain receptors being ‚Äúwoken up‚Äù (she explained it in depth but it was over my head) so don‚Äôt get discouraged if you experience this!

Giving Wellbutrin a try.,"for me wellbutrin felt like taking a sugar pill. my friends alleged that it seemed to alleviate my depression some but i personally couldnt tell a difference at all, especially since a lot of my depression and adhd symptoms overlap. i was eventually switched to zoloft which seems to do better for the depression and anxiety. finally got officially diagnosed recently and ive just started concerta.

everyone‚Äôs different! hope it works out for you"
Giving Wellbutrin a try.,"I'm on Wellbutrin, too. For six months so far. It helped me a lot, it is easier to get up and to do at least something. I mean, I don't struggle with adhd paralysis like I was before, but other adhd symptoms are still present so I expect my psychiatrist to give me medications for adhd concretely (concerta is in the game)."
Giving Wellbutrin a try.,"While I love what wellbutrin has done for me, I have a problem with it. It helped soooo much with memory and attention problems, I felt functional and could do things  when I wanted to do them. Some people said I was even calmer on the medication. 

BIIIG PROBLEM, it stopped working after 3 months. Going off of it for a couple months didn't help and so far trying a higher dose hasn't helped either.

Giving Wellbutrin a try.,"It will be hard, but consider a tolerance break.  You might want to tell you doc you are taking a drug holiday though.  In your case, you wouldn‚Äôt want to fully stop cold turkey, but even a partial reset might be enough üòÜ

For example, a plan to reduce stimulants by 50 percent over a 10 day period.  Just something to consider."
Giving Wellbutrin a try.,"I went to see if I could find that info about Wellbutrin affecting dopamine.

From 2004: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC514842/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC514842/)

From 2021, I think this is the site my pharmacy printouts come from: https://www.rxlist.com/wellbutrin-drug.htm"
Giving Wellbutrin a try.,"Are you suggesting a holiday from the Wellbutrin? I probably didn't explain too well, but I'm not on the stimulants any more."
Giving Wellbutrin a try.,"Ahhhhhhh yes, I confused what you meant in that moment LOL.  That was only for stimulants and not Wellbutrin."

ADHD and Wellbutrin,"I'm in the same boat rn with Wellbutrin. First night I took it I got wildly suicidal (which is not normal for me at this stage in my life) and felt like I was speedballing or something. Not fun. Executive functioning is still rough, but the symptoms seem to be getting better each day. It's 100% a good idea to keep your doctor in the loop though and try to get a follow up appt asap. Quitting cold turkey may not be a good idea and they might give you a plan to taper off."
ADHD and Wellbutrin,"I was on 150mg of wellbutrin and lamotrigine for Bipolar prior to the ADHD diagnosis for three years and the wellbutrin I was told would help relieve ADHD symptoms. (They suspected it but again- pre diagnosis.) It just made me anxious and kept be on the edge of a bipolar manic episode for YEARS.
I know people for whom wellbutrin works well, but it didn't for me.


Follow your Healthcare providers' instructions, I think, but advocate for yourself and tell them everything that's happening.¬†"
ADHD and Wellbutrin,This is extremely comforting to hear üòÖüòÖ Ill keep on taking them. I have a follow up with my doctor in December but ill definitely make sure to schedule sooner if its getting worse!

I‚Äôm taking Wellbutrin but tried Adderall for the first time and‚Ä¶ oh my god,Get a new doctor. If you‚Äôre legitimately diagnosed with ADHD and non stimulants aren‚Äôt working then he or she is essentially saying they won‚Äôt help you. This is extremely unprofessional considering your alcoholism was most likely caused by your undiagnosed(at the time) ADHD in the first place.
I‚Äôm taking Wellbutrin but tried Adderall for the first time and‚Ä¶ oh my god,"You can always try to talk to them about it, especially since you've tried multiple non stimulants and obviously you've talked about them not being effective and why."
I‚Äôm taking Wellbutrin but tried Adderall for the first time and‚Ä¶ oh my god,"I agree, from what you‚Äôre describing you were very likely self-medicating. A good psychiatrist should be able to understand the difference. Maybe don‚Äôt tell them you‚Äôve tried your friend‚Äôs adderall though haha"

Switching from Concerta to Wellbutrin ,"I took it and it did not help my concentration at all. I am someone who has benefitted from stimulants though, so that was explained as a potential reason. It did help with depression when I took it though. Was on it a few times - teens for a few years, age 27-29 and in my 30s for a bit"
Switching from Concerta to Wellbutrin ,what was your dosage on Wellbutrin? And did it make you lose weight?
Switching from Concerta to Wellbutrin ,Did not lose weight from it.. maybe at first it did quell my appetite but that didn‚Äôt last. I want to say 100 or 150 twice a day..
