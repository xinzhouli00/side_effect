concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I am a 35-year-old female. I suspected I had ADHD, generalized anxiety, and depression for many years based on severe mental illness in my family, but have only recently been diagnosed. After the effects of Covid and a family crisis while trying to finish a Master's degree, I was overwhelmed and unable to do anything. I began Concerta, and it gave me hope. Drugs are not a magic pill. If you think only taking Concerta will fix you, that is the wrong attitude. You have to make other efforts like counseling or changing your environment. Concerta changed my life, but it was coupled with a lot of effort to create the right conditions for me. I began waking up early to work in the morning so I would not be distracted by anyone or anything. I made sure to eat my three meals a day, even if the drugs suppressed my appetite. I highly recommend it. It's really worth a try. I'm on the 54 mg."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""My 9-year-old son has been on 18 mg of it for a month now and it truly is a miracle! We literally noticed a difference in him the very first day. His appetite has actually increased! His sleep has not been affected. He actually goes to bed now the first time we tell him to. He will still express that he doesn't feel tired and that he doesn't want to go to bed, but when we tell him that he needs to, he just goes to his bed without the fighting or trying to do anything else to stop from going to bed. He is more loving and affectionate now, whereas before he was always so defiant. He does cry a bit easier now, but it's better than the anger he felt before. He's helpful and considerate and empathetic. We reluctantly gave him this drug, and it has saved my marriage, and our overall quality of life has improved drastically. He did a presentation in school and received an A! Just try it... You will know right away if this works for you... hopefully you are one of the lucky ones."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""Having suffered with depression and ADHD as an adult, honestly this medication is a godsend. I'm only on 18mg (Extended release) and take it with Wellbutrin (for the depression) and I must say it's a life changer! The extended release makes a big difference - blood levels are more stable. No more emotional moods, no more crying, no more feeling like dying, no more negative thoughts. Also, you can concentrate for long periods of time and not get frustrated and be very clear-minded. I can study for 6 hours straight! After trying so many medications, this just works. Side effects: Fast heartbeat, lots of energy, and maybe a libido boost. Really good for adult ADHD and depression. Please note. Everyone is different. You might have a different experience."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I am 54, been taking methylphenidate (Ritalin first, then Concerta) for 14 years. I decided to come off cold turkey to see if the doctor made a misdiagnosis, lol. After a month, I was sleeping in the woods, homeless, driving a Mercedes Benz, when I realized something was wrong! I am on meds for the second day now, and after an hour, I could feel myself becoming emotionally and mentally comfortable. I couldn’t stop running for an outside solution to an inside problem. I could not focus, could not engage at work, so I didn’t work, therefore, everything started to crash down around me. I almost lost everything I had and loved. ADHD for me is here to stay! I will end with this: I have no chance at a normal life without the help of medication!"""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""Concerta is WONDERFUL. I’m 24, and I’ve struggled all my life with mental illness. 4 months ago, I was diagnosed with ADHD and Bipolar II Disorder. My psychiatrist said I had to get the mood balanced from the Bipolar before we could treat the ADHD. Once my mood was stabilized, I started to try some stimulant medications. I tried Adderall 5mg and 10mg. It was an absolutely awful experience. I had two friends recommend Concerta to me, so I requested it from my provider. I was prescribed 18mg, and after ONE day, let me tell you, I was feeling like the best self that I knew was there all along—calm, attentive, and enjoying every passing moment with bliss. It keeps on getting better, and I hope it continues to. I'm going to up my dose next month. If you are struggling with ADHD, try this. I feel so amazing I could cry (in a good way), no hassle with multiple doses. I was on the brink of giving up, but I gave this a go. Please, please try it. The only side effect is less appetite, BUT WHO CARES AT THIS POINT."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I've been taking Concerta for the past 14 years since it came out (24 now) and I don't plan on changing unless I'm forced. I've tried other medications and none work as well with as few side effects. Right now I take the 54mg. Sure, I experience some side effects, but I've learned to manage them over the years (force myself to eat, etc.). The treatment of ADD/ADHD is only effective through a multifaceted approach, medication AND counseling/therapy/behavior coaching. Without Concerta, I would never have made it through school or had successful relationships. ADD makes life hard, but with the right combination of treatments, it is more than manageable."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I’ve been on Concerta for the past week and a half. On one hand, it works really well when it comes to productivity and organization, as it keeps me energized and focused, and also improves my driving skills! However, taking this medication has significantly worsened my mental health, causing me to experience paranoia, mood swings, anxiety, and even some suicidal thoughts. Although it does its job, I can’t keep taking it simply due to the effect it’s been having on my well-being. I’ll be scheduling an appointment with my doctor to change my prescription momentarily. However, just because Concerta hasn’t worked for me, that doesn’t mean it can’t/won’t work for you."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I am a pediatric nurse and a mother of a child with ADHD. The nurse in me hated the thought of medicating my son with anything, yet the mom in me knew something needed to be done. My son went on Concerta at age 6. He takes 36 mg, and today is 12 and still on the same dosage. It has helped him in so many ways... grades, focusing, decreased aggressive behavior, and friendships, just to name a few. Though I was resistant, this was the best choice for my child. It's been 6 years, and he is great. It does decrease his appetite during the daytime, but he does catch up in the evening with calories. I highly recommend a daily Carnation shake with whole milk or a multivitamin if your pediatrician agrees, to prevent missing any nutrients. Good luck to you all."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I don't know how I feel about it. I'm 21. I was diagnosed with ADHD this summer. My grades went from C's and B's to A's and Dean's List. I can't say I hate it, but I can't say I love it either. I used to be this free-spirit girl who was bubbly and loved to go out with my friends. Although I did have issues with controlling my impulsive mood swings, I still was really happy. Since taking it the past 7 months, my friends call me the cave dweller. It's sad because I'm actually content with being alone. It used to drive me nuts. I'm almost scared to talk to people I don't know. My social life has gone in the dump. Nothing bothers me. It makes me get really good grades, but it takes away the passion. I feel like a computer."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""My son was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 6. I was extremely against trying medications, but after an extremely difficult kindergarten and start of first grade, I decided that it was worth looking into. My son was miserable, and it broke my heart to see him coming home every day in tears. We tried a variety of behavioral interventions, but nothing worked and my son was not happy. We decided, based on a friend's advice (her daughter had success with Concerta), to give it a shot. OMG! It was like night and day! Slight decrease in appetite initially, but other than that, it's been a godsend. Wishing all you parents the same success we had!!!"""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I've used Concerta for 5 years and loved the improvements at first - I became successful, in perfect shape, and did most things extraordinarily well. My life did a complete 180. Once unfocused, unmotivated, and disorganized, I transformed to near perfection in everything I did. The price you pay for perfection - I've lost my friends and my social abilities. I used to be fun and full of life! You begin to seclude yourself because you are too focused, too mechanical. You lose weight because your appetite goes away and you are indeed anorexic. I couldn't sleep, had extreme anxiety, headaches, dry mouth, highs and lows....I can go on and on. It changes you and you may think it's great but ultimately you lose yourself in the process."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""Since starting on Concerta, I have been able to effectively get my life together. I am no longer impulsive, hyper, inattentive, or anxious. The last two years have been the best I've ever experienced. I struggled with procrastination and mood issues prior to being medicated for ADHD. Past inaccurate diagnosis caused doctors to label my ADHD-I with a number of false mental health issues. The wrong medications caused a lot of damage in my personal life. Now, I have finally been able to get my life together. Concerta is a very good medication for those with ADHD/ADHD-I."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""My 4th grade son began taking Concerta 2 1/2 weeks ago. It has been the best decision I ever made. His teacher says he is a completely different child. His funny personality remains but he is on task, finishes all his homework in class, and actually tells other children to quiet down. I lamented for many, many months about whether or not to have him begin a stimulant. It is obvious that it was the right decision. I make sure he eats a hearty breakfast. He knows he needs to push himself to eat something at lunch and drink plenty of fluids. He did tell me he felt 'prickles in his head' for the first 2 days. His teacher reported he was a little tired for a couple of days as well. He says his mind is more clear and 'not so jumbled'. We're thrilled."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""Concerta has made me more focused and things seem to be easier to understand for me. I am 36 years old and was diagnosed with ADHD. This is a wonderful medication and for me, life-changing. I now know I needed this medication for many, many years now. And so far no side effects, sleep better and still have my appetite. I have more energy and I don't procrastinate anymore when I need to do something, I just do it without procrastinating about it. Exercise is also easier, which is good because I am overweight and need to lose some weight. I seem to be able to interact with people a lot easier and now I can have a conversation with people without blurting out things before I forget what I want to say and having to pause in between sentences."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""My son is 10 years old. I suspected he had ADD when he was 6, and the teacher kept telling me he was spacing out in school, but he is also so smart. I decided maybe the work was just too easy, and he was bored. In 4th grade, I couldn't take the complaints (almost daily) and had him tested. He was diagnosed with ADD and given Concerta. I can only tell you that his math teacher sent me home a note on the day he started medication to ask where I got my new son from, she could not believe it. She said he even went in during his lunch break to catch up on some work. He lost his appetite for the first week or so, but regained it and hasn't had trouble sleeping at all. He is happier, his teachers are happier, and I am HAPPIER! Thank you, CONCERTA."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""Ok, this is where I am after two weeks. I'm turning 54 one of these days, Managing Director of my company, and self-diagnosed with ADHD about a month ago. I matched ALL the criteria. Went to see a doctor and he confirmed my suspicions. I relayed my struggles with studies at University and he referred to me attaining two degrees as a 'miracle.' I cannot begin to explain how difficult studying was, not to mention having to sit through hours of lectures. There was no - and I stress - NO filter between my brain, mind, and my mouth. Anger, profanity, and impulse behavior was only curbed by my life-long ability to fall asleep anywhere, anytime. Imagine an alien being in charge for 53 years. It's all gone. Why did no one help me with this before?"""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""My 9-year-old son has struggled for years, in school and at home. Impulsive behavior, anger, inappropriateness. I always fear the worst and avoided medication for 2 years. It’s been one week since he has been on 18 mg Concerta, and it’s been a lifesaver. He enjoys school now, not getting in trouble, he’s so much better at home as well. No side effects so far, eating and sleeping no problem. So happy we chose this path. Hopefully self-esteem and relationships can be saved :)"""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""My son is in 4th grade and just started taking Concerta two days ago. So far, so good! He is dealing with severe ADHD. He was a very angry child, and since he started taking it, the teachers have sent notes home saying how well he is doing! School is easier so far, which means a happier boy! He hugs me and kisses me, and we have had fewer fights about getting homework done. We are very pleased!"""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""If you have ADHD, pills like Strattera (non-stimulant) do not seem to work. You do need a stimulant. Concerta is amazing medication. I used to be on it from 2nd grade all the way until 9th. Looking back now, at 21 years old, I see that after I stopped it in high school, my grades dropped. Just started taking the average adult dose of 36mgs and it has really helped me in class, although there isn't an insane change. MAKE SURE TO TAKE IT WITH A DECENT MEAL OR IMMEDIATELY AFTER. If you don't, you'll find yourself with an upset stomach for a lot of the day."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""My son started on Concerta about a year ago. It has transformed his life. I don't like giving medicine, but I have tried absolutely everything else - swimming, brain gymnastics, etc. Nothing really helped. He is naturally bright but just couldn't concentrate - particularly when it came to classroom work and focusing on a project involving writing. The transformation has been incredible. He had an excellent school report in every area. His teachers are thrilled, he is confident and happy, and enjoys school. He doesn't take Concerta in the holidays or at weekends and manages fine going back on it on a Monday morning. Only one side effect which is a lack of appetite. We ensure he goes to school with a good breakfast, and then he has a huge meal when he gets home."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I started Concerta when I was in 7th grade. I am now 14, and I started off with 36mg. Now I am on 54mg. At first, I had a big boost in my grades! I started getting A's! This year, I have been noticing in school that I have been more anxious, depressed, not hungry during the day, and a little bit socially awkward. I am trying to deal with my side effects. I am going to the doctor soon about Concerta. You are not alone."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""My daughter just started taking Concerta for ADD about 3 weeks ago and she has made significant improvements. She is now able to stay on task and complete assignments, which she was having a hard time doing before. There has been no difference in her personality, which was a concern of mine. She also has developed a better sleeping pattern, whereas before she had a tendency to have insomnia."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""Was diagnosed with ADHD (inattentive) & excessive daytime sleepiness at age 30 (cis woman) & was prescribed Concerta for it. Started out on 18mg as advised by my doctor since I had anxiety & they feared worsening it. But immediately noticed a huge improvement in focus as well as willingness to do tasks I originally avoided like a plague & feared all my life. It was like night & day, I sobbed that same day realizing this was that semblance of normalcy others experienced on a daily basis while being productive & getting things done. After being told all my life that I was either too lazy or easily distracted & rude, I now know it wasn't my fault. My anxiety even got better because that was the source of it. However, with the 16mg, the positive effects started to go away after a month, thus the bump to 27mg, and now currently 36mg, which is my sweet spot. It's been about 6 months & I would recommend giving it a try for adults! Remember it's not a 100% cure, you still need self-therapy/management. GL!"""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I am 30, started taking this due to excessive daydreaming and, quite frankly, not getting anything done. Could not focus for more than 10 minutes before a thought would come and get distracted by it. Apartment was in a mess. Priorities are all over the place. Wanted to do so many things and all at the same time. So I went to the doctor and left with a prescription for Concerta 18-27-36mg. I don't know if he had the right diagnosis, but stuff is getting done and everything is great. Less tired, fewer naps, did not take a nap since I started this. Now I'm at the 36mg step. The truth is the drug is only 10% of the solution. Once you know you can do something, you have to keep that mindset and go with it, or else you will take this drug forever and ever."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I am in my early thirties and very recently started drug trials for ADHD. After trying Vyvanse, which didn't work out, I moved to Concerta. On the lowest dose, I had concerns, as it seemed to make my ADHD symptoms worse. I became more irritable and more distracted. After a week, I moved the dose up to the next level and had a terrible day. Extremely irritable, so lethargic I could do almost nothing all day, difficult time sleeping... I had difficulty dealing with my children if they did the slightest thing wrong. Concerta is not for me, I will try something else."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""For most of my life, I have drifted in and out of employment. Being told I am a daydreamer and missing out on things most people would spot a mile off (dates, small details on forms, cleaning, rota, etc.). A few months after starting this medication, I also started a job! In immigration, so a lot of paperwork, extensive training, long shifts, and difficult customers. Almost a month in, and I’m getting appraisals, 100% on most of my work, always on time, and never miss a beat! I am 30 years old, and I could cry. This has literally changed my life. In the first week, you will experience jaw clenching, etc., but it settles. I am taking two tablets of 18 mg a day. Sorry to those that have experienced bad side effects, it’s trial and error, and maybe your chemistry does not align with the medicine, but that’s okay-keep trying!"""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I grew up with severe panic attacks. When I was 19, up until the age of 27, I stayed in my room. I couldn't leave my house. I had/have severe anxiety and depression. Years went by and I lost hope. I didn't have a job, I was a loser. I took a mindfulness class and after each mindfulness tape, I noticed I was in extreme pain, more so than the other people sitting around me. It was then that I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. I was prescribed Adderall and Vyvanse for my ADHD but they made me extremely tired. Currently, I am on Cymbalta, Concerta, and Remeron. With this combination, I began a full-time job. I have been employed for 7 months, and I would be lost without Concerta. If you're looking for a drug that is similar to Wellbutrin, Concerta is the answer. Do not give up hope. Never give up hope. Don't take 'no' for an answer, and if a doctor is diagnosing you incorrectly, leave and find a different doctor. There is a right combination of medication out there for you. Never give up!"""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""When I was about 13, the school psychologist who I was seeing for behavior problems suggested to my mother that I start taking Ritalin. I was hyperactive, could not focus, blurted things out, and was generally viewed as a weirdo by my peers. My mother refused to follow the psychologist's advice because she 'didn't want me on medicines'. The same diagnosis and suggested treatment followed the next year and the year after by the psychiatrist who I was referred to. Eventually, I dropped out of school, somehow managed to get my GED, and enroll in college. I decided a few years ago to see a doctor and he prescribed Concerta. I am now able to follow through on projects and not feel like a failure, frustrated all the time. It has really worked for me."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""My daughter was 9 when she was diagnosed with ADHD, but I always knew. I figured if it didn't affect her schoolwork, why treat it? Well, come 4th grade, her teacher commented that her grades are okay, but she's much brighter than what she displays and is completely distracted. Just a week or so before the teacher meeting, I was just starting to think I would get her evaluated since she started to hate herself, getting in her own way (you ADHD folks know what I mean by that). She was put on Concerta and is now in honors math and a straight A student. The best part was seeing her go from hating herself to loving herself and owning how bright she is. People would tell her she's bright, but she just didn't believe it until she was able to work up to her full potential. Also, afterwards, I was diagnosed with ADHD and am having great success with Ritalin and will be switched to Concerta at my next visit."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""Worked for me the first year I took it but then it started to have really bad side effects. I have ADD but I don't have hyperactivity and I was getting socially awkward and having anxiety and even depression. I don't recommend it for someone who's not hyperactive."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I've been on Concerta for a few weeks now, I was just recently diagnosed with ADHD, and it's my first medication. I am a 15-year-old female. I started with 18 mg but didn't feel any difference. It only decreased my appetite (I lost about 5 lbs a week) to the point where I became underweight. My doctor recently upped my dose to 36 mg, and I feel worse than before. I've been having a hard time falling asleep and have slept very restlessly. I am still losing weight. I've also noticed that I feel more moody and impulsive, and I have been hyper-fixating more and lashing out at my family. I have a doctor's appointment next week where I hope to switch medications."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I'm 21 and I've been taking 72mg (two 36mg capsules) a day since I was about 17. Concerta changed my life. I was failing school, and no matter how hard I tried, it didn't change anything. I became depressed, slept for 14+ hours a day, and gave up. Then I was prescribed Concerta, and it changed my life. It keeps me focused, motivated, and energized. However, the side effects are very real. I don't sleep much, which is why I usually don't take it on weekends to catch up on sleep. It reduces my appetite, so I eat a big breakfast before taking it in the mornings. It does elevate my anxiety, and not saying it's something I suggest.. but I smoke cigarettes to help that. Also, I don't know if this is common or not, but it keeps my digestive tract regular."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I've been taking Concerta for the past five months. When I first began taking it, I would get headaches and appetite problems, but those side effects disappeared after about three weeks on it. Concerta has not only improved the amount of work I'm able to accomplish, it's improved my self-esteem as well. I no longer feel as shy and cluttered as I did before I started taking Concerta. I like that it lasts throughout the entire workday, so I don't have to worry about redosing. Overall, Concerta has been a very positive experience for me."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""This drug is a lifesaver. If it weren't for this drug, I would be failing in college and sleeping all day. Concerta has helped me study and lessen my depression symptoms. It's definitely worth the risk. The only downside to this drug is that it doesn't last 12 hours, well at least for me. It lasts like 9 to 10 hours. Also, as with other ADHD medicines, you can become tolerant to the point you don't notice it working. My grades improved with this medicine, and I was able to write a 10-page paper in the 12th grade and a 25-page paper in my junior year of college. I'm even more organized outside of school. I wash my clothes and shower more on this medicine. I can finally read more without getting mentally tired as much. I wouldn't be able to pass my classes in college if it weren't for Concerta. Everybody with ADD or ADHD should try medication for it. I recommend Concerta because it lasts throughout the day. It lasts longer than Ritalin."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I'm a 15-year-old girl who started off with Vyvanse for a year but became anorexic. I switched to Concerta! The first couple of years, I felt so amazing because I have never experienced what it felt like to succeed after trying so much. Then I got to High School. My meds ended a relationship. I was always paranoid and extremely nervous. I am like a robot now. I'm either extremely emotionless, really mad, or really paranoid. My friends tell me that it's like talking to a stranger. I get frustrated so easily and don't care about anyone or anything around me. I don't want to be taken off my meds because I'm really successful. But should I really have to choose between my loved ones and school? I shouldn't have to pick."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I've struggled with ADHD and depression for about half my life. I started this medication around 3 months ago. I take the 54 mg dose. I've tried probably every antidepressant there is, and quite a few for anxiety. But this, I think personally, Concerta has helped quite a bit in regard to both. Because of it, I've been able to wean off my antidepressant and no longer have to take it. The appetite suppressant does help me out since I'm working on weight loss, but it can also be a struggle to eat at times or find a food that is appetizing in general because of it. And the medication can cause constipation and dry mouth, which is inconvenient. Overall, I think it's helped me a lot in focusing on coursework and its intended purpose."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""Before Concerta I was labeled disruptive; unintelligent, impulsive, poor concentration etc. The worst part was that no matter how hard I tried, I always messed up, and it was never on purpose. I am often described as having 'no-filter' between my head and mouth. Now, with Concerta, I am able to 'filter' information correctly. I have control with what I say, and I can concentrate when I need to. This is, however, no miracle - I have bad days. Like anyone, my cognition suffers if I haven't had enough sleep, etc. Concerta only gives one control of their actions and organizes things in your head a bit better - something I had been long without. Please consider the facts provided by health professionals."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""Concerta is by far better than other ADHD meds, such as Adderall, in my experience. It is milder and much better at helping where it needs to and doesn't make me feel sick like Adderall did. I recommend this for all of you who have anxiety. Adderall made my anxiety worse on it. Concerta helped me feel less anxious because I have ADD and anxiety, this helped so much."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""My experience with Concerta has been amazing. I am 12 and this has helped me deal with bullying, anger issues, and lack of focus. I have learned that just because you are ADHD does not mean you can't have a normal life. I recommend this to anybody who is ashamed by their weight, has trouble focusing, and has anxiety issues but make sure to eat regularly because Concerta makes it so you don't know if you are hungry or not."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""My brother was prescribed Concerta two years ago, and I feel the need to share his story so everyone knows how helpful this drug is for people suffering from ADHD. He is taking it and Strattera both for his condition, and the Strattera worked well for a long time, but when he was prescribed Concerta in addition to this to further help with his symptoms, it was just amazing. His breakdowns and tantrums decreased in number, he started doing his chores and homework again, and he started doing random little things to help other people out. This medication is a controlled substance, so it's harder for him to get than his other medicine-he has to have an appointment with a specialist every two months to stay on it, though I don't think it's that way for everyone. He was born addicted to the painkillers my mother was on, as he was seven weeks early, and therefore has a higher chance to become addicted to substances in the future, but this does not seem to be a problem so far with Concerta."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I started taking Concerta about 6 months ago. The first month after being diagnosed with ADD, I was on Ritalin, then switched over to Concerta. I’m on the 72 mg of Concerta, and it really has changed my life. I failed two classes in college before I started medication, and now I am doing really well in school. It really helps me focus in general as well. I’ve lost 70 pounds since I started taking medicine for my ADD, so I’m currently 140. This medicine destroys my appetite until it wears off, so I usually only eat at night. It also has messed with my sleep, so I make sure to take it by 9 in the morning so that it will wear off by like 10 at night. Whenever the medicine wears off, I become super unproductive, but I’m not sure if that’s how I am without it or if it’s just worse when the medicine wears off. I really recommend Concerta, it really has helped me so much."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I'm 20, I have been on Concerta for 3 years. Before, I was on everything else, every other medication was an emotional rollercoaster ride, and I was very angry. Now, 5 years later, I'm the happiest, most confident person. I graduated college with honors and lead an 'out of trouble' life!! THANKS CONCERTA!"""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I was late being diagnosed with ADHD (late 40s). I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 1992, but I never felt this was the correct diagnosis as my meds never helped me with all the different thoughts going on in my head. As soon as I started Concerta, I felt more relaxed, my concentration improved greatly, and I could sleep peacefully without any benzodiazepines. I am currently (for over 4 years) on a dose of 72 mg, it still is as effective as when I started, and luckily I haven't had any of the listed side effects. I think if anybody feels they have ADHD, they should seek psychiatric help to do the relevant tests."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I have been taking this for 10 years (started at 18 mg, went up to 36 mg). Recently (several months ago), I developed several horrible side effects. For example, it made me feel nervous. I could not keep still. It also made me extra irritable (to the point I was yelling at my friends for the littlest things). I also felt depressed (to the point I did not want to get out of bed at all) and could not sleep. The doctor brought me down to 18 mg, symptoms did not improve. I immediately stopped taking this and felt 100% better the next day. The doctor put me on Adderall XR, which works a lot better with very little side effects. Please avoid Concerta if possible."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""My daughter was finally diagnosed with ADHD Inattentive-type at age 16 after a lot of stress regarding high school academics and feeling 'dumb.' Concerta has been nothing short of a miracle for her. She finally ended up on the 54mg dosage and does very well. The only side effect she has had is loss of appetite which she now knows to eat a healthy/big breakfast before her medication in the morning. She then eats a normal dinner. She has occasionally had insomnia if she takes her medication later in the morning or if she has accidentally had caffeine. Overall, she is in a good groove with this medication and her SAT score went from 1600 to 2000 after medication and a prep course; GPA from 3.3 to 3.9."""

Looking back, I should have been diagnosed as a child, but my intellect got me through college, the military, and life in general thus far. Had I been treated as a child, life would have been a lot easier. However, my struggles have made me who I am. I recently began a new position at work, and it is extremely challenging. I need to be exceptionally focused and organized. I was drowning and getting depressed about my lack of success until I started taking the Concerta. 2 months later, I have been promoted and able to handle a larger workload... HOWEVER, my son developed severe tics."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""My 13-year-old son and 9-year-old daughter both have been diagnosed with ADHD. I, nor my husband, could wrap our minds around our kids taking medicine, but were forced to give it a try. My son started taking Concerta when he was in 4th grade, and my daughter started taking Vyvanse in the 3rd grade. The results were amazing! Their handwriting went from sloppy to super neat, reading skills increased, grades were mostly A's... and many more great results! The bad part about the pills is that they have so many side effects that were making them seem like totally different people! They were skinny, depressed, had insomnia, headaches, twitching, and were angry. We withdrew both from public school and started homeschool. Now learning at our own pace!"""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""Concerta has helped me tremendously in school. My grades skyrocketed after only one semester of use. The first day, when I was on 18 mg, I could already feel the effect. Now, I only take Concerta (27 mg) on school days and other days which I know are going to be exhausting. Even on the days I don't take it, I feel happier than before. Concerta gives me motivation so I can actually live, which makes my motivation stick around. I can now socialize without feeling like my energy has been sucked out of me after one conversation. I can now do my homework and chores. I do things in my free time, instead of crashing in bed after a day of school. Though my appetite changed, and I lost a lot of weight, I have a lot to thank Concerta for."""

Overall, Concerta has truly changed my life and made me a more focused student. Since I've been on it for so long, I have learned to manage side effects but some that have been ongoing are: upset stomach right after taking the medication (due to the stimulant effects and lack of food), slight headaches, jitters, binging when the medication wears off, and occasional paranoia. When first beginning the medication, remember to force yourself to have some caloric intake even if it is just a smoothie. This has been life-changing, but please remember to balance out your diet."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I would recommend this medication ONLY if you are 100% positive you need medication, by that I mean teachers and family recognizing the issue. My mom finally decided to give me Concerta during early middle school after my teachers advised it for a few years. I recommend beginning with 9 mg and slowly going up if needed. This medication is horrible in my life in the sense that I feel like I need it to do good in school, especially now I'm in college. But it causes me to be incredibly depressed. I continue to take it because grades are first, but for kids I recommend keeping a very close eye on them and follow up on depression issues because as a kid in middle school, it was horrible."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""Concerta helped me so much. Before Concerta, I dreaded doing school work or even regular household chores. While on it, I want to do my homework and chores.

Positives: my grades and work ethic excelled, accomplished a lot, confidence raised. But, it may have just been me, but after being on Concerta, I became very antisocial (the complete opposite of myself) and basically got lost in my head. I also suffer from depression and severe seasonal affective disorder, and my first winter taking the Concerta was a horrible experience. The important thing to remember with this medicine is that it is not what is making you 'smarter' or more accomplished, it is merely helping you to do these things without your ADHD holding you back."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I was initially diagnosed with ADHD-combined hyperactive and impulsive when I was 16. Up until that point, I struggled with my attention issues and excessive energy, and it became increasingly difficult to cope with the symptoms as I got older. My doctor prescribed me Concerta 54 mg once a day. I immediately noticed significant improvements. I was able to think more clearly and communicate coherently. At the same time, I noticed that I had a better ability to control my attention and remain focused over a more prolonged period of time. My grades improved, and my relationship with friends and family became much better. I'm now 26 and still taking the medication. The therapeutic effects are still evident."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I started Concerta in August after Vyvanse gave me bad side effects. I began at 36 mg and now I take 54 mg. Being on this has helped me so much with classwork and anxiety, I no longer have anxiety spirals like before! I’m actually interested in my uni classes, and I’m getting better grades. The best part of Concerta is that it stops my obsessive anxiety. I can control my thoughts now, this is something I was never capable of in the past. It gives me a sense of mental relaxation that I’ve never had, and it’s life-changing. I feel on edge, kind of jumpy, and alert, but no uncontrollable anxiety like before. At first, I had some weird side effects, like tics, shakiness, lack of appetite, and peripheral hallucinations, but these side effects are so worth not having the terrible anxiety like I used to. Concerta helps me feel more sure of myself because I’m not spacing out on information or having anxiety attacks. I feel more confident and capable. It’s wonderful!"""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I have been dealing with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) all of my life. At 50 years old, I was diagnosed with ADD. I had suspected it for some time and began taking 28 mg of Concerta each day. After approximately 2 months, I went to a lower dose of 18 mg per day. It has had a positive effect in that it is much easier to stay on task, my ability to concentrate has been significantly increased. In describing its effect, it seems that my mind has slowed down. The side effects have been minimal - a little lightheaded at times. I do not take it every day, sometimes, I usually use it Monday to Friday."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""Higher grades, acknowledgments from teachers, and the ability to focus are the upsides. Wanna hear the downsides? I've lost all my friends, I honestly don't know what happened, I must have changed. I lost a dramatic amount of weight (from 220 lbs to 145 lbs in half a year) to the point where, when I returned to classes after break, nobody could believe how skinny I was. A decline in self-confidence. A scarily reduced sex drive. Sweat pours from me all day, even though I'm cold. A slowly declined desire to socialize, I don't even want to leave my room after school anymore. It's been over a year. I hate who I've become, and at the same time, I have no desire to be my old self again. I've been on Concerta consistently for over a year now. I've tried alternative meds to no avail, and at this point, I'm nearly an adult, thus I'm running out of time to fix myself. If you are a new patient and are experiencing these problems like I am, don't suppress them to keep the benefits, else, you will have this mess to fix like me."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I was recently prescribed this, and let me tell you, even with it being a stimulant, it has helped my anxiety. I can explain things a lot better. I can focus more - my brain isn't all over the place. I feel a lot more confident, my form on my workouts is better. I'm losing a lot of weight, though. At 27 years of age, I was recently diagnosed with Asperger's because of social situations. I am now 28 as I type this. When I was a kid, I was first diagnosed as learning disabled. Throughout my teens and early adulthood, I was diagnosed with social anxiety and depression. But I do not care, because my symptoms improved dramatically.

So, my doctor prescribed 18 mg Concerta. I've taken it for a week so far, and I'm loving the results. I'm now always listening in lectures, always focusing on what the professor is saying. My room, car, and desk are now more organized than they have ever been, and it's stayed that way so far! Many people complain about a lack of appetite, but I haven't noticed that at all! I've noticed two minor side effects so far: headaches that start later in the day, as well as some minor irritability."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I've taken Concerta on and off since I was 9, so 11 years now. I've taken every ADHD pill ever made, and this one is by far the best out of them all. It has helped me a lot in life. I was able to focus in school, and I always had good grades. If you miss a dose, you can definitely feel it both mentally and physically. I was able to graduate at the age of 16 and start working full-time. I'm not sure where I would be in life without this truly amazing pill. I would recommend it to anyone who would benefit from it."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""My daughter was diagnosed with ADHD in the 2nd grade, and her doctor and I discussed different medications and settled on Concerta. Grades were never a problem, but behavior and socialization were. She hated the medication and would spit it out or hide it. It gave her headaches, loss of appetite, and sleep loss. Eventually, she began taking it regularly and began to do well in school. The behavior problems ceased, as well as socialization. She took this medication for about 2 years, and then I decided to pull her off. Her teacher didn't even notice and thought she was still taking the medication because she was so well-adjusted and presented no serious issues. She never took meds again and learned to cope. She has ADHD but manages it other ways."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""A couple of years ago, I was diagnosed with inattentive ADHD and was first given Vyvanse. It caused me to have awful anxiety and chest pains. This turned me off to stimulants for a while. Finally, I started seeing a new doctor, and he prescribed me Concerta XL for my long days at work, and it has definitely changed my life. At first, it was for my ADHD, but it also helps with my depression. It makes me feel awake but not jittery and anxious. I feel more social and talkative (I'm very shy, and people always make comments on how I don't talk that much). I don't have as many bad days like I was having before. I still get them, but they seem to be more mild and less often. There is a slight come-down period when it is wearing off, and you can get a little bummed during this time. It's not as bad with the long-acting Concerta like it is with regular methylphenidate. I highly recommend trying these medicines."""

However, over the past year or so, I have been experiencing negative side effects such as depression, headaches, and loss of appetite. I can manage the headaches and appetite problems, but as for the depression, it is so bad that I am considering switching to another brand or changing my dose because when I am on Concerta, I become virtually emotionless, and as a result, I am struggling to maintain good relationships with my friends and family members."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I've been on this medication for about 14 years now. And I love it but hate it.

I have to take a pee test to get the script four times a year, then a pre-approval from the doctor, then I can buy it for $30 instead of $300. I wish I was joking. As far as the drug itself, it's great! High focus, low appetite, it's great. The only problem is it makes my hand spasm, and sometimes it can mess with your head. But all meds have cons."""

He blended in well and behaved well but was always in outer space, thinking of everything but school work. When he started Middle School, work production became a new challenge. We had over 3 hours of unfinished classwork every night plus homework. Teachers said it was doable to complete in class, and most did. The work wasn't hard, so I agreed. We finally decided to try Concerta. Within 2 days, we went from 3 hours of unfinished classwork and missing assignments to no homework, no missing work, and all A's. My son said, 'I did not know this is how normal brains feel.' It was the best decision I ever made. My only regret is allowing him to suffer and think he was dumb for so long."""

It will not get your work done for you, nor will it solve all of your issues that you may have, but it will make life a lot easier to live. Instead of always worrying and being behind, I can get what is really important done and get to what is important another day. My mood has not been bad, my driving is less road rageish.

Concerta helped me concentrate, but it didn't make me too jittery or unfocused, and it feels just right.

I am energized during the day and do not 'feel' like I am 'coming off something'. I highly recommend this."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""It took a while to get used to, but I weigh about 160 lb and take 54 mg daily now. Overall, it just makes it so much easier to be focused and organized, with the meds, I can actually keep routines. The biggest side effect for me is the appetite loss, I lost 30 lb within the first 6 months. Thankfully, that has lessened a lot, and I’ve gained some of the weight back, but definitely something to consider if you have concerns about being underweight or disordered eating. As well, if you try to have caffeine, nicotine, sativa, or any stimulants, you’re going to feel like absolute garbage, so follow the doctor's order and avoid them. The only other warning you might not find online is that the brand name Concerta is expensive and not always covered (in BC, Canada). It wasn’t covered by my university health plan, but it’s covered by my work plan with Blue Cross. For 90 tablets of 54 mg Concerta (brand name, my doctor told me not to take the generic), it costs $400."""

It almost feels like time moves slower, I don't feel rushed anymore. People are able to talk to me without me interrupting to blurt out what I was thinking. I can sit down and start something and continue to do it until it's done. I don't have the urge to jump up and do something else.

I think if you really have ADHD, this medication works and only doesn't work when you haven't got it! First week struggled sleeping but fine now, and there's no loss of my appetite, I just don't crave the sugar and junk food that I used to, so it's a win-win for me because I'm a boxer and have been in sport all my life!

It was especially helpful when I was in school because it was just so impossible for me to stay focused in class. As an adult, it makes work so much easier for me because my job requires things to be done with a lot of precision. Side effects I've experienced have been headaches (occasionally migraines), inconsistent appetite, restlessness at night, some difficulty sleeping, and constant thirst.

When I was told I was a few pounds overweight, I was happy. The solution to the problem is to force yourself to eat. It's not a bad sacrifice if you see a positive difference in your performance.

Went to the Doc for help, was diagnosed with ADHD, apparently had it all my life. The Doc put me on Concerta 56 mg daily. Pretty much the same effects as the speed. Love it, no sides :)"""

concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I was put on 36 mg Concerta in my 20s, and it helped drastically. I was able to finally concentrate and read without having to reread things because I was distracted every 0.5 seconds. I lost my appetite and would get insomnia at times. I went from a size 16 to 8 within a year, which honestly helped my health, and I was able to start going to the gym for the first time. I got off it when I moved overseas for 8 years, and now I’m back on it. The first couple of weeks are a bit rough, it gives me anxiety and restlessness, it’s an instant laxative, and makes you pretty antisocial. But remember, your body adjusts, and you start feeling more normal and less anxiety. However, if I take 36 mg and have any other stimulant like caffeine, I literally feel like I’m having a heart attack and anxiety attack at the same time. Be careful with mixing stimulants with this med if you have anxiety. Otherwise, it’s amazing and works miracles. Also, when I got off the 36 mg, my weight went up so fast."""

His self-esteem was back, and he was social and smiling all the time. Made new friends easily and enjoyed things other than video games and TV. Lately, we have noticed a change... his concentration is not as good, he has trouble getting organized at school, and likes to stay in his room for hours at a time. He reminds me of the kid he was before medication. April 1st, we have an apt with the pediatrician, and I am assuming we will up the dose to 27 mg and hopefully find our happy boy again! We have also tried Biphentin, which did not work for us. Concerta has been a lifesaver, and I hope it will continue to be with the proper dosage."""

I was on Adderall before but had really bad anxiety and sleep side effects and even more side effects, so my doctor gave me a Concerta prescription and I took it and felt so energized and focused. I love Concerta so much, the only complaint would be it lowers my appetite and gives me a bad mood sometimes, but I use Prozac to balance that out, and this medicine is amazing. I tested it on video games and kept winning because of how focused I was. This medicine is great for ADHD, I highly recommend it."""

He was put on Concerta 18 mg and was a little unwell for two weeks, with a sick stomach, lack of appetite, and slightly listless. Made sure he ate breakfast before taking his tablet. He did look a little thin after about 1 year. We persevered with Concerta and life quickly improved until almost all ADHD problems had disappeared. Did not increase the initial drug dose. But after 18 months, he was becoming quiet and withdrawn. Decided to stop Concerta. Mild withdrawal symptoms for a week or so. We have never looked back. He is now 14, not on any medications and is a tall, healthy teenager. Wow, recommend this tablet. He may need it again someday."""

THANKS CONCERTA."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I'm 18F with strong hyperactivity, less issues on the inattentive side. My main reason to pursue medication for ADHD was that my brain was so disorganized that it made it hard to remember things, do tasks correctly, and work up the motivation to do things. Adderall slowed down my brain in a way that was unnerving. I owe a lot of my exercise, conversational skills, and artistic passion to my hyperactivity, so that wasn't an option. I started 18mg Concerta, and it wasn't a huge difference in the way I thought, but it made my brain just organized enough to allow me to reap the benefits of my ADHD without being overwhelmed by everyday responsibilities! It also has no withdrawal (apart from ADHD symptoms worsening) making it a low-risk treatment that you can easily discontinue in the event of an emergency. Higher doses will definitely make it hard to eat, though! I also do have trouble sleeping on it if I take it too late, so I set an alarm for 7:30 am every morning to take it."""

I only take 18 mg twice a day (I'm 34), and while the anti-depressants make me lethargic and were causing my work to suffer, the Concerta has been a real lifesaver.

I'm kidding, we didn't like it that way, and neither did our parents. I muddled through high school and even got a college degree, but I really struggled. I remember when I first heard of ADD and meds that treat it, and it was a revelation. I've tried many of these medications, and Concerta is my favorite. To me, it's the smoothest. The short-acting drugs hit too strongly and then quickly crash. Hard. I had been taking Metadate CD until an insurance change made Concerta cheaper. Concerta is smoother than Metadate."""

Even my focus was off. I went back down to 18 mg and it's working much better. No irritability, depression feeling. Make sure you're on the right dose for your body. Too much can do more harm and too little may not do anything."""

It did help my grades, but I felt most of it was placebo, and the fact that the side effects were so horrible, I wanted to focus on work to distract myself. It made my anxiety unbearable and constant. My heart beat in my head. My whole left arm and pinky would feel numb and prickly. I knew I was hungry but could not eat and was disgusted by food. I fell into a horrible depression and felt just overwhelming darkness. The pros were that it made sitting in long classes and retaining information much easier. I felt excited about learning and getting work done. Overall, it helped with school, but the side effects are not worth it."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 7. And started taking Focalin soon after. I was very impulsive and couldn't focus. When I was 11, I started Adderall, which would keep me up at night. And I was dependent on it. Last year (13 years old), I was on 31 mg of Concerta. The first day I took it, I was lightheaded and nauseous. I am almost 14, and I take 27 mg of Concerta. It has helped immensely with social situations. I am now a 'cool' kid. I still struggle with school and am not very hungry. But overall, I think Concerta is a good fit for me. On an average day, I eat a small breakfast of toast and a fruit or vegetable, skip lunch (not ever hungry), and eat a light dinner. On the weekends, I don't take it, and I have the munchies all day."""

When I first started taking it, it felt like a miracle drug - for the first time in my life, I felt awake, driven, and organized. Over time, it has become less effective - it's definitely tolerance building - but it's still way better than going without. I get chest pains and headaches sometimes, I have started getting mild anxiety (which I never had before), and I feel the cold a lot more than I used to. All of this would be completely fine were it not for the main side effect of Concerta: weight loss. After around 18 months of taking it daily, my weight has gone from 130 lbs to 104 lbs - regardless of how much I eat."""
concerta,For ADHD,"For ADHD""Concerta has been a life-changing drug. My studies have become more interesting, and I have a long attention span. I wake up before tests to study and have more motivation to do laborious tasks. It has helped with my learning disabilities in regard to memorization, math, and writing. I can read without checking my phone every minute. The downsides are you become antisocial, don't eat lunch, and don't have much of a sex drive. Once the medication wears off, you become hungry and return to normal. In my opinion, the benefits outweigh the cons. I do believe I have developed a tolerance, so I will be upping my dosage from 36 mg to 54 mg in the near future. If you are struggling in school, this medication is for you! I wish I had this earlier in my life so I could choose a more challenging major."""

Adderall XR and IR had awful crash that would ruin the rest of my day, excessive thirst/dry mouth, and headaches. Strattera wasn't taken long enough to be therapeutic, it just made me depressed so discontinued. 36mg Concerta has provided a level of symptom relief that I did not know was possible. I don't crash on this medication, it just slowly wears off. I'm not getting dry mouth or headaches, and eating is way easier on this med than the Adderall.

In my opinion so far, it's definitely smoother and calming compared to other stimulants where you feel wired. It also helped with my attention and focus. Only downfall is it only lasted literally 2 hours. I'm hoping it's because of the dosage, so I'll see if I can raise it to 36 mg.

I am also doing therapy, and my wife spends a great deal of her considerable intelligence and thoughtfulness improving my mental health and, in consequence, our married life. The medication certainly helps to motivate for work, meeting and talking with people, and generally feeling a sense of my ability to function."""

After 2 weeks, the dose was upped to 36, and the foggy feeling subsided a bit. Then on 54 mg, 2 weeks later, it was like I could see things more clearly. My memory improved, I'm 'sharper', I actually feel smarter. All of my anxiety, nervousness, etc. is gone.

But we experimented with Adderall (good pill but knocked me out at 7:00 PM after it wore off, so it didn’t address narcolepsy) and Ritalin (heart rate was just insane) and Vyvanse (gave me anxiety that I never had).

The medication is really helpful in my academic life, however, it increased my depression and anxiety. Over the years I’ve been taking it, the medication decreased in its effectiveness, and I had to continually up the dosage. I’m only saying this because for anyone who needs to use it, they need to be aware and check themselves and their mental state.

My appetite has gone down for sure, but I try to focus on superfoods I can eat in small amounts.

When I stop taking it, I feel depressed for days but it will wear off as 'naturally occurring chemicals' reach equilibrium again. I suggest cycling it according to your productive days: 3-4 days a week and the rest off (avoiding tolerance and dependence). It enhances your current focus, so start working/studying for 15-30 minutes THEN take it. I've researched the most irrelevant topics which excite me the most for hours, only to find that within 30 minutes the Ritalin's effects are going to wear off."""

Then I took 20 mg, I felt a little more energized, but nothing else. Then I tried 30 mg today. I felt extremely fresh in my mind, instead of the weird slump I'm usually in. Very happy, which suggests that what I lacked before was dopamine. Still no difference with anything else, like my poor concentration and focus, but on the other side, there are no side effects as of late.

Pros: Works quickly, cheap, well-known and researched, relatively easy to obtain (not as much of a shortage as other more 'fancy' formulations), and works for a large population of people with ADHD. Cons: Wears off quickly (sometimes 2 hrs for me), feels like a bumpy ride of ups and downs, hard to remember to take on time. Drink lots of water, make sure you graze on high-protein snacks to avoid getting hangry, take a shower, and get up and do something.

It causes you to sweat a little more and be a little more irritable than usual, but it is really a great med to help depression.

However, my heart beat can be erratic so I also take metoprolol (half tablet) morning and evening which is perfect for me.
When it wears off by mid-afternoon I take a quick release of 10mg. However, I’d really like to increase the dose. It doesn’t affect my sleep (I’ve never been a good sleeper anyway).

It definitely works for those who need it - I can promise that."""

At first, my doctor started me on Vyvanse (in addition to my antidepressants) 60 mg for 4-5 months and it really helped. The only reason I switched to Ritalin is because I'm going overseas and Vyvanse is illegal there. For me, Ritalin works better than Vyvanse! I was started on 20 mg of Ritalin three times daily.

Just like how SSRI's eventually 'poop out' and stop working because they've used up the body's natural serotonin, Adderall will eventually 'poop out' on you and stop working. Yet, even worse when this happens, the more you take, the worse you feel because it's like revving an engine with no gasoline left in it.

The reason being, the FDA says the manufacturer only has to “demonstrate” it “works in the same way” as the brand-name, i.e. generic ingredients do not have to be the same, which is why so many don’t work and/or make people feel sick. In my experience, the only generic that works like the brand-name is Prasco, which acquired Teva’s generic XR in 2016. Few pharmacies use Prasco as their generic because it’s more expensive! My doctor specifies “Prasco generic only” on my prescription for D-Amphetamine ER 30MG Salt combo. By law, the pharmacy must comply if Prasco is one of their overall suppliers. My insurance changed, so I called Prasco to see if they sell to Costco. They do. It just takes a day or 2 for the pharmacist to order and fill my script.

Except for Teva, which now if I had to guess, instead of the 10mg Blue IR Adderall manufactured by Teva. Instead of 10mg in these pills which are labeled for 10mg, I can guarantee you if I took it to a lab and had it analyzed, there is probably only 5-6mg of mixed amphetamine salts contained in each pill. Something has happened with the Teva brand that the FDA needs to look into, these medications are life-saving and necessary for those with ADHD in order to function and not cost society $300 billion in damages a year alone due to untreated ADHD."""

Let me tell you, this is the WORST drug manufacturer on the market. The Allogen is junk too. I've been on a few medical chat sites just to see what I can find out about Mallinckrodt and see if others felt the same way, and they absolutely do! Literally 100's of people have complained to the company itself and to the FDA. This has been going on for a solid 5 years at least, and the stuff is STILL pure unadulterated JUNK."""

After the 3rd day, I start to feel better and those 'tranquilizer effects' go away. Adderall is an emotional regulator for me. It works wonders for my impulsivity, racing thoughts, fidgeting, feeling overwhelmed, anger, anxiety, zoning out, and my mouth. Yes, my mouth has always been my biggest challenge and has caused me tremendous social/professional problems.

I think Teva must’ve burned the patent formula or something because it has never worked like the Barr, not even close. So many negative side effects (migraine headaches, heartburn, nausea)! I keep hoping at some point they might magically start producing a decent version that actually helps instead of hurts. The original Barr had true therapeutic value. Eon Labs produced a decent generic for a while, but bam, it suddenly went to garbage at the end of 2018. So switched back to Teva a couple months back and it started okay (not as good as Eon but better than everything else out there), then last month's refill is feeling like they’re changing to something bad too.

After a lifetime of compensating for my 'slow processing', hiding my disorganization, and pretending to be on the same page with everyone else, this explains everything.

The efficacy of both of those brands is extremely low, like they are just sugar pills. Plus, they've increased my anxiety and increased my number of regular headaches. The powers that be need to get this situation under control, or lots of us who struggle with ADHD and other comorbidities aren't going to make it out alive. Literally.

About two months later, I started an anti-depressant because I thought I was just depressed. I ended up being allergic to the anti-depressant, so had to get off of it. Following that, the symptoms just got worse, at one point, I didn't get out of bed for a week. By chance, I didn't take the Lannett XR, and I noticed a significant change in how I felt. I switched to a different manufacturer because only Lannett XR was available (due to the Teva outage). Within two days of being on that, my symptoms significantly improved.

I started eating bananas, peanut butter, electrolytes, taking magnesium and potassium citrate, etc., and everything improved within 48 hours.

The only bad thing is that you really have to be careful of how much you take because it can have the opposite effect, i.e., severe anxiety and no focus, but if you take it the right way, it will change your life!

As a patient, you must ask yourself if the side effects outweigh the benefits. I refused treatment until age 32, which has been beneficial to my physical health. If you are at the mercy of ADHD, I strongly advise you to use some of the new apps with or without meds. Daily for the first 3 weeks is simply miraculous. Lastly, the world or your coworkers don't need to know about your diagnosis. ADHD is still stigmatized as a disorder that only stupid people have.

Depending on the dosage, you'll be severely lethargic and wind up sleeping for a few days. Beware of the day's end - you'll likely need something to sleep or relax, which can cause problems.

dexedrine,For ADHD,"For ADHD""This medication is hard to find, which is unfortunate because, quite simply, it works on some ADHD people when other more common medications do not.

Obviously, my brain needs help with dopamine, and too much norepinephrine is dulling and unpleasantly sedating.

Unmedicated, it's like I have an angry, frustrated, and stressed-out little leprechaun inside me, and on the Dexedrine, he's slowly being replaced by a peaceful Buddha—and believe me, I've never experienced 'Peaceful Buddha' before in my life—except maybe when I'm in nature on my mountain bike, etc. If you're not loving Adderall for similar reasons, I highly recommend trying the Dex. It's been a revelation. I rated it only 9 stars because I feel spacey for the first few hours."""

While Adderall contains dextroamphetamine, the l-amphetamine, and it gives me very bad anxiety. Dextroamphetamine helps me focus without causing extra anxiety, and I prefer the instant release, which allows me to fall asleep. Ritalin caused anxiety even worse than Adderall did. One thing I recommend is to take a day or two off every week or so. If not, your tolerance might build up, and you might find the medication is not working. Also, you need to learn to pay attention to your body's other signals telling you when to eat. You probably will not feel hungry, and your stomach. This does not mean you don't need food, however."""

Since that time, I have retired. As a teenager in high school, I thought that studying was going to my bed with a book and falling asleep.

I have to point out, for those of you who like Adderall and the “speedy“ feeling you get from it, then Dexedrine may not be for you. However, if you are like me and don’t like feeling like you’ve taken a narcotic stimulant, then you should certainly try Dexedrine/dextroamphetamine… You won’t regret it!!

I was told that TEVA was made by the same drug manufacturer that makes the name brand, so I paid extra for the name brand, and that does not appear to be working either. I have been told that TEVA no longer makes Dexedrine, so I am not sure what I should do. Also, I was told that the FDA no longer allows doses over 60 mg, but I am not sure that is true.

dexedrine,For ADHD,"For ADHD""As the title states, I had very high hopes for this medication as I have responded very well to name brand (Shire) Adderall XR in the past. The difference between name brand and generic Adderall is the combination ratio of dextro to levo. Name brand is 75:25 in favor of dextro and generic is closer to 50:50. This caused me to believe I respond to name brand and not generic do to the dextro content. If you guys don't know, Dexedrine is 100% dextroamphetamine which made me think I stumbled into a gold mine after being off Adderall for 2 years do to the fact they don't sell name brand where I live. Long story short, I took my first dose a few hours ago, and it does not have any effect. The dose I took is 15mg which is the equivalent amount of dextro found in a 20mg Adderall which I was prescribed in the past and worked so well.

Newer, is not necessarily more effective or better. As the prescribing of Adderall and Ritalin became increasingly dominant, it became challenging to find pharmacies that carried Dexedrine in stock, often they would have to special order it, and this process would take several days. Due to this difficulty, my doctor persuaded me to try fist Ritalin, and then Adderall. In comparison to Dexedrine, I found these 2 newer medications not nearly as effective and unpleasant to take.

Rather than a smooth and consistent maintenance of focus, I experience peaks and valleys of it. It takes effect after 45 min, then it lasts for about 1-2 hours before I get incredibly sleepy for 1-2 hours, then it takes effect again, then I get sleepy again, then it takes effect again. I've talked with my psyche and with the 20 mg split I take the first dose, then the second 10 mg dose 45 minutes later and this has mostly, but not completely, solved the issue.
Also, (consistent with all of the stimulant medications I've tried though) is that it stops having any effect after about 3-4 days of usage straight. So I need to calculate for a day or two where I can't take the medication in order to allow for it to work later.

Dexedrine targets most of my issues; being able to shift focus, getting side-tracked less, completing non-stimulating tasks/chores, and drifting off in my own head mid-conversation less. It quiets my head so it's not constantly buzzing with random distractions. 
However, If I don't eat within 3 hours of taking it, I get intense neck pain which causes a bad headache/stiffness/pain all day.

dexedrine,For ADHD,"For ADHD""This medication is hard to find, which is unfortunate because, quite simply, it works on some ADHD people when other more common medications do not. Dextroamphetamine (generic)/Zenzedi (brand name) acts more on dopamine than norepinephrine.

It helped my emotional overreactivity, but not other ADHD symptoms like initiation of tasks and related anxiety/irritability, procrastination, and negative ruminations (mentally getting 'stuck'). Obviously, my brain needs help with dopamine, and too much norepinephrine is dulling and unpleasantly sedating.

Unmedicated, it's like I have an angry, frustrated, and stressed-out little leprechaun inside me, and on the Dexedrine, he's slowly being replaced by a peaceful Buddha—and believe me, I've never experienced 'Peaceful Buddha' before in my life—except maybe when I'm in nature on my mountain bike, etc. If you're not loving Adderall for similar reasons, I highly recommend trying the Dex.

As for ADD and ADHD, it is interesting that both have become epidemics in the U.S., but not in Europe.  I believe this is because in the US of the massive profitability pharmaceutical experience in developing new drugs for every affliction.  That is just my opinion.

As an adult, I learned many organizational skills, but continued to struggle terribly with lack of motivation, focus, and enjoyment in life, despite living in abundant material comfort. When I started taking 30mg of this a day at my doctor's urging, it was as if a bright light flooded what had previously only been utter darkness in my brain for 30 years.

I go without it for weeks, and if I have a binge cycle - not one bad day, but a few in a row - I go back on for a few days until I get my eating under control. Side effects - moving my tongue at higher doses. I drink a lot of water, and it does 'stimulate' my GI tract.

You start developing side effects like irritability, anger, paranoia, mania, and aggressiveness. I have been using this drug for 7 years. Due to the nature of the best, the side effects will not hit you out of the sudden, and you will not recognize yourself in the mirror after 7 years of usage. I think once you start down this road, you can never stop, the only solution is probably switching between different generics like Adderall IR and XR to trick the body into not developing a tolerance because of the slightly different ingredients.

I've tried other medications for depression and anxiety, but this is the only drug...the absolute only med that's helped with the binge eating. I am not taking anything else at the time of start & I'm now beginning the second month with only Vyvanse. At first while taking the med, I had no desire to binge eat & I would not have any urge to plan my day around the binging. This was unbelievable as I've been consumed every single day with binge eating. I have to say this med is exactly what I need while I work on the other components of recovery & therapy."""

vyvanse,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I wouldn't typically give any drug such a high rating, but Vyvanse has truly changed my life with few, if any, side effects. I take 20 mg once a day, and it lasts 12 to 14 hours. It took about 2 weeks of trial and error to find the dosage, but it was very worthwhile. I am happier, less anxious, and significantly more organized than I have ever been. I am a student, and many areas of my life -- academics, social functioning, general health, etc. -- have all improved greatly. The inattentive fog has cleared, and I finally feel able to create the life I want to be living. Better control over my life has also given me back self-esteem and stabilized my moods. I am so grateful."""

It seems to me that when I first started taking it, it made me feel like a zombie, but I would focus and work. Then I stopped, and now I have been taking Vyvanse, as you can tell, for a decent amount of time now. I started with 10 mg, then 20 mg, etc. Now I'm at 60 mg, and it seems to finally work. I am focusing and just doing everything right now, lol."""
vyvanse,For ADHD,"For ADHD""Both my daughter and I take Vyvanse for ADD/ADHD. It has helped us significantly. My daughter initially tried Biphentin, but it did not help her symptoms and caused her not to eat or sleep. With Vyvanse, there is a dramatic improvement of her symptoms and less side effects. It just suppresses her appetite. We take her off occasionally to help her appetite and have also tried a short-acting formulation that she takes after breakfast and again after lunch so her appetite isn’t as affected. I experience very good results on Vyvanse as well (and don’t mind curbing my appetite slightly)."""
vyvanse,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I started this medication when I was 45 years old and started back to college. I never excelled in college in my younger years and actually made the Dean's List after taking Vyvanse. I am now almost sixty. I really don't need it other than helping my golf game once in a while. I just wanted to say that it is a great medication for keeping one’s focus, however, I did experience quite a bit of hair loss. I only take 20 mg. I do take breaks on this medication and have noticed that my hair grows much thicker when I am off of it. Just an FYI."""
vyvanse,For ADHD,"For ADHD""Vyvanse is not like any other ADHD med out there. It is better! A lot better! It does not matter how much Vyvanse you take, your body will not let the amphetamine level go any higher than it can process it. This gives you control. Vyvanse is a spark, it lets you choose what to focus on, rather than make you hyper and euphoric like other ADHD meds do. Why it does not work for some people? Because most people fail to use ADHD meds accordingly! No med is a 'magic bullet.' For those of us who actually have ADHD and have tried absolutely everything (healthy diet, good night's sleep, exercise, multivitamins, etc.), Vyvanse is the 'missing piece to the puzzle!'"""
vyvanse,For ADHD,"For ADHD""My daughter is 8 and has tried other medicines for ADHD. I did not like them because of the side effects, she was like a zombie. With Vyvanse, I don't notice a major change in her personality. And she is focusing better in school. Much better grades. I love this medicine because she still acts like my daughter and not some alien."""
vyvanse,For ADHD,"For ADHD""Dr. diagnosed me with ADD, he put me on Vyvanse. It did help me focus but caused near anorexia. It actually helped with depression symptoms that antidepressants were never able to help me with. I never really wanted to eat while I was on the medication. Just no appetite. All of my life was normal/thin. No prior eating disorders. Never was a binge eater. I went from 120 lbs to 100 lbs on the medication. The worst is stopping the medication. Be warned. I developed a never-before binge eating disorder from discontinuing Vyvanse. Gained back all the weight I lost PLUS I have gained an additional 30 pounds on top of my normal weight. I put on about 50 pounds since stopping Vyvanse. I cannot get the weight off. I often think about starting up the pills again to help me rid the after Vyvanse weight gain, but what will happen to me after I stop again? Wish I never started it to begin with."""
vyvanse,For ADHD,"For ADHD""My 8-year-old daughter has been on Vyvanse for almost 2 years. She started on 20 mg a day. She seemed to be doing better as far as focusing, but very emotional. Her doctor decided to up her dose to 30 mg and now 40 mg. The 40 mg also seemed to help at school, her grades went up, and she was able to pay attention. I'm now noticing that my little girl is not the same person. She has become rude, depressed, emotional, getting in trouble, suicidal, and just out of control. Parents really should keep a journal of changing side effects they notice. Needless to say, my daughter is no longer taking this medication and has not yet found one to replace it."""
vyvanse,For Binge Eating Disorder,"For Binge Eating Disorder""I have been on Vyvanse for a year now, and I have slowly lost 60 pounds simply by being able to focus on the things I need to do in my life and not about food ever. So I just eat now for fuel, the way it should be! I noticed a huge difference when I don't take it, I feel that hunger feeling just like before. I still struggle at night, so it is not going to fix everything, but it has been a miracle for me. I have struggled since I was 8 years old, and now I'm 37. I plan on staying on Vyvanse until I can get myself under control. I still need to lose about 70 more pounds to be at a healthy weight for my height. In the meantime, I am going to school for psychology with a concentration in addictions and hopes to figure out how to control my behavior."""
vyvanse,For ADHD,"For ADHD""It made me go crazy. I was convinced of all kinds of conspiracies. Making connections that are not there. To me, it felt so real. I didn't seek help because of paranoia. It ended in me getting into a bunch of legal trouble because I thought people were out to get me. My life was completely ruined. I lost everything, and I mean everything. I lost the love of my life because I threatened her family, thinking they were replaced by robots because I thought AI was taking over and messing with me. I thought the craziest stuff. After coming off it, I spent months wanting to commit suicide. I ended up homeless because of my depression. I slept in my car. One night, I got drunk, wanting to commit suicide. I woke up to cops. Impounded vehicle and DUI. I tried to get help everywhere. I never got the help I needed. Keep this in mind when you decide to take this drug. You will be the one suffering alone. There is nothing in place if something like this happens. It has taken me forever to recover from."""
vyvanse,For Binge Eating Disorder,"For Binge Eating Disorder""I started what I thought was my weight loss journey at 404 pounds. That was not my biggest, but my biggest since my last weight loss adventure. I started with phentermine ($15 a month). I live in Ohio, so I could only be on it for 3 months as it is a state law that mandates use. I went down to 343. I was put on Belviq for 2 months ($80 a month). I gained 10 pounds and was binge eating like crazy. I told my doctor about it, and we figured out it was BED. So I was put on Vyvanse ($35 a month). I am 2 weeks in and I lost what I assume is some water weight, and I stopped binging. I've also gotten a lot of energy, and I focus really well now. I'm on 30 mg. Hopefully, when I go back in 2 weeks, I'll be back down a few pounds."""
vyvanse,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I took Vyvanse for about a year but had something similar since I was about 8-10 (15 now). I used to be a super happy and respectful little girl. This drug drained me of my personality. It made me a walking nightmare of anger and depression. I even attempted suicide on this drug. I experienced severe confusion and dizziness at times. I still have poor coordination (started a little while after I started taking it), and there have been days at a time when the thought of food made me sick, so I just didn't eat, making me actually sick. I always got random feelings of nausea and headaches, as well as hypersensitivity. My personal belief is that people under 18 (or people unable to decide for themselves) should not be prescribed this drug unless 100% necessary. I made it very clear that I didn't want to take it but was not taken seriously because I am a minor. I have been off of it for some time now, and I'm slowly making progress toward a better me."""
vyvanse,For ADHD,"For ADHD""Let me just say. Life without Vyvanse for the last six months has been a complete and utter hell. I decided to get off my medication stupidity and have suffered endlessly. Without Vyvanse, I am always anxious, starving all of the time which causes anxiety, can't get to class on time or don't show up at all, have no motivation, headaches and nausea, gained weight, my boyfriend broke up with me because I turned into a legit socially incompetent vegetable, wasn't able to drive to see my family, and overall was scared to get out and do anything. Without ADHD medication like Vyvanse, I wasn't living.. afraid to do anything. HUGE MISTAKE. This medication is life-changing. When I was on it, I was amazing. I kicked ass in college with honors, wasn't anxious about eating, went from 170 lbs to 139 lbs, more productive, happy, and not anxious about driving, classes, going out to eat or going to the grocery store. Anyways, I am getting back on these meds because I miss living. So should you! Take a low dose!"""
vyvanse,For Binge Eating Disorder,"For Binge Eating Disorder""I'm so happy for everyone that has a positive experience. I started Vyvanse 30 mg 2 months ago, the first week was very good, and I was able to control the impulse to binge. I was on Bupropion 300 for depression and anxiety, and the only thing that Vyvanse has helped me with is that. After a week, I binged again pretty much every night. The doctor increased Vyvanse to 40 and decreased Bupropion to 150. Once again, I felt great about my depression and my anxiety, but this time I'm eating more than before. I'm hungry all the time, I binge every night. I have never experienced a lot of energy like people have described, and I don't feel any side effects, a little bit sleepy around 5 PM. I feel like I'm not taking anything at all. At nighttime, I can sleep with no problem, except the nights like tonight where I can't sleep because I binged so much that I can't lie down because of GERD. I feel like crying, I'm angry with myself and frustrated that Vyvanse is not working for me."""

Well, the first day I took it, I DID NOT OBSESS OVER FOOD, which I have all my life. Weekends have been hell, especially when dieting, which I am constantly doing. And when not dieting, I'm bingeing - classic BED. So I eat a regular meal, then a piece of candy or sweet, not the whole bag! And then I don't obsess over the next bag. I think that's how 'normal eaters' do it. Truly amazing! I hope it lasts. Weight loss is bound to happen, but more importantly, no obsession."""
