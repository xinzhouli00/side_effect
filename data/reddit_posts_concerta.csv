Is it normal to feel like 27mg no longer does much?,"The easiest way to find out is to ask if you can move up to 36mg.  Might work, might not.

But in the meantime, look for changes in your routine.  Starting university is stressful, structureless and anxiety-inducing and it's no doubt caused significant changes in the exact things that affect how methylphenidate works.

Compared to last summer:

* Are you eating as much as you were?
* Are you sleeping as much and as well as you were?
* Are you staying as hydrated as you were?
* Are you exercising as much as you were?
* Did you increase any other kind of stimulant, like caffeine or nicotine?

Changing any of those things will significantly impact how Concerta works for you."

"First day of 27mg, headache and unable to understand what I’m doing","When you say you can’t understand what you’re doing, do you mean you can see yourself doing things but feel a bit separated from them? I’m just guessing but I had that thing that I’m describing for a few days. I was thinking “ who decided that I should do this thing I’m doing? and where are these words coming from that I’m saying!? “ It was weird but it went away after a few days."
"First day of 27mg, headache and unable to understand what I’m doing","This is normal... you are introducing more stimulants into your brain.  Needs time to adjust.  Drink lots of water, =eat protein, and top up your electrolytes."
"First day of 27mg, headache and unable to understand what I’m doing","I had to quit the drug as soon as I got moved up to 27mg. Same problem, I ended up just giving up on adhd meds altogether. Can’t get the ones that worked for me in the past."
"First day of 27mg, headache and unable to understand what I’m doing","Yup, and it took a while to get better. On 27 I was also sleepy (36 was better for me) but I felt dazed and foggy and out of it yet my memory was suddenly excellent and I could learn things fast while feeling entirely stupid.

It went away in a few weeks."
"First day of 27mg, headache and unable to understand what I’m doing","I had the worst headache and jaw/muscle stiffness for the first 3 days on 36mg and then it completely went away. After looking at advice I added more protein to my breakfast and made sure I was drinking plenty of water, more than you think you need. I also have electrolytes every morning for other reasons but that’s meant to help too 😊"

need help regarding naudea and hunger pangs,smoothies ! obviously not a complete substitute for food but it’s better than nothing and can make such a difference
need help regarding naudea and hunger pangs,"For me, WHAT i was eating is the reason I had the gag reflex. I can't eat anything with gluten anyway because I have Celiacs, but I'm also hypoglycemic and can't have sugar so I eat alot of non-sugar sweeteners. Now those sweeteners make me gag SO BAD.
I can drink broth, eat meat and veggies no problem. I can make home made cookies with allulose, but I gag on literally anything else. 
If I were you I'd try super whole foods like chicken and avocado to start, or even just some soup."

My son has autism and ADHD too but had a couple of bad experiences with stimulants and hates the idea of trying them again. I always assumed that the meds were a bad match for people with Autism and that that door was closed for him for good. Great to hear from you that it might be possible for him to try again at some point in the future though. (I think he maybe just needs to start with a smaller dose.)

It's like my kidneys have a turbo function ,"I noticed a similar effect. It reminded me of when I was drinking, once I had my first pee of the day it was like breaking the seal. Then I had to go every 30 to 60 minutes after that. Now that I'm no longer taking Concerta I find my bladder is back to normal and so is my thirst."
It's like my kidneys have a turbo function ,"Not available here.  We only import 18, 36, 52. 18 worked fine but there's a shortage and I can never find it, that's why we upped it, because no concerta is no option, it's the only formulation of this drug in this country and atomoxetine doesn't work. Wellbutrin helps very little and in the winter I get so depressed even that barely does anything. I tried other antidepressants on top of it, i don't get along with them.

Anyway, not the point, I'll be talking to my doctor I was just curious if it's just me.

[Clarification: I am not being treated with Concerta for depression, they're just comorbid and  the meds interact, and bupropion (Wellbutrin) is often used for adhd off-label.]"
It's like my kidneys have a turbo function ,"Reassuring, thank you. Did you switch to something else?"
It's like my kidneys have a turbo function ,Welbrutin and atmoxetine sucked for me too
It's like my kidneys have a turbo function ,"Not at the moment. I found out that I probably have ADHD, but I'm in my 40s. The medication helps but it came with a lot of side effects that I did not enjoy. I think I may cope better with a more holistic approach, including therapy and exercise. I tried a couple different ADHD medications, and while they all had helpful effects, I found the emotional and physical side effects really unpleasant."
It's like my kidneys have a turbo function ,"Atomoxetine made me feel so angry all the time.  And the idiot treating me back then said I can't take Concerta then cos it'll do the same.
They're different chemical mechanisms, it *cannot*!
Anyway, concerta 18 and welbutrin 300 was fucking magical for me. Concerta by itself did not work, 18 was too little and 36 was too much, I'm taking other stuff to manage the weird anxiety I get from having to take it 36 now, I can't wait to go down when I find the 18 again.

Every doctor ever accusing me of drug-seeking should have their license revoked, I'm actively trying to take *less* stuff."
It's like my kidneys have a turbo function ,I see. That makes sense.
It's like my kidneys have a turbo function ,Hi I’m on Wellbutrin for adhd too. A lot psychs here in Thailand prescribe it to help with ADHD. I started concerta 27mg around 5 weeks ago and that plus the 150mg slow release Wellbutrin seem to be working well 👍🏻
Concerta and Alcohol ,"personally i find that if i take my concerta around 7:30 in the morning, it’s completely worn off by the evening. if i go out for drinks, i don’t find it has much effect. there have been days that i took my concerta late and got a drink around maybe 2 or 3 pm, and i found it didn’t get me near as buzzed. as long as you’re drinking after your meds have worn off, you should be fine in moderation. if you think they’re still kicking, just be careful, as stimulants can raise your tolerance and make you drink more to get the same effect."

Concerta and Alcohol ,"I have not noticed many effects when drinking on this medication! As those stated above, normally the medication will wear off before someone would start drinking. Unless you take it super late or start drinking super early (no judgement here, it’s 5 o’clock somewhere), I wouldn’t be overly worried… I just always make sure to have my water bottle filled and ready because the dry mouth hits hard."
Concerta and Alcohol ,"When I started taking concerta I went to a Halloween party and drank quite a bit. I felt completely fine actually, so you should be good"
Concerta and Alcohol ,"Concerta & alcohol have opposite effects on the central nervous system, there is no point mixing them. In fact it could be harmful because both can be dehydrating and stress the heart.

That said, Concerta wears off pretty early in the day for me, so if I start drinking after dinner I figure the interaction is minimal. I still take it easy to be safe. If I'm going to drink during the day (ex: brunch) I just do not take the Concerta."
Concerta and Alcohol ,"Biggest issue is you won’t feel the booze at the full potential leading you to possibly drink more. The other issue is methylphenidate and alcohol creates ethylphenidate similar to cocaine and alcohol. (cocaethylene) the biggest thing to take into account is drinking lots of water and monitoring your alcohol intake. As well as using alcohol at the tail end of your Concerta dosage. I’ve consumed alcohol on concerta and I have been fine, but the results are purely anecdotal."
Concerta and Alcohol ,"When I first started concerta and had a beer after work, it took me over an hour to finish it, because the alcohol hit me so hard lol
I had been on 18mg for 2 or 3 weeks. 

Now i‘m on 54mg and can have alcohol in the evening when I take then in the morning. 

Just start slowly, don’t overdo it and see how you feel. And don’t feel ashamed to just not finish your drink if it makes you feel bad"
Concerta and Alcohol ,Only problem is That you can drink much more without beeing drunk so keep an eye on That
Concerta and Alcohol ,"Concerta has no effect on my alcohol tolerance - anti-depressants, yes."
Concerta and Alcohol ,"Concerta and alcohol won't lower your ability to drink alcohol. In fact, the opposite will happen. In the liver, the methylphenidate (MPH) and the ethanol combines to form ethylphenidate (EPH) thereby reducing the amount of ethanol in your system.

The convoluted reason why my physician tried warning against doing so (and she was reading from the Japanese pharmaceutical handbook ) was that ""..because it will decrease the effects of ethanol, the patient may then drink more alcohol and become over-intoxicated."" That made no sense to me but told me all I needed to know... that drinking alcohol while on Concerta lessened the effects of alcohol. And the ethylphenidate - being similar to methylphenidate - actually helped my ADHD as I had gotten to a maximum level of tolerance on methylphenidate."
Concerta and Alcohol ,"Lucid, less drunk, less impulsive, powerful."
Concerta and Alcohol ,"conversely, alcohol enhances the effects of stimulants so the opposite may happen. just be mindful that although you may feel fine drinking more than your usual amount that probably won’t be the case when the meds wear off"
Concerta and Alcohol ,Avoid. Save the extra stress on your heart. And enjoy the productivity & health boost
Concerta and Alcohol ,I don’t do it because my hear rate goes crazy
Concerta and Alcohol ,"idk if its my concerta generic or if its my bupropion generic but when i drink alcohol, if i want to get a buzz i need to down like two beers quickly. but, i become ""sober"" again after 30 mins, 1 hour max.

ex: went to montreal w my girlfriend a couple months back. one evening, we both had cocktails, but i finished mine and about half of hers. 30 minutes later, we go to a restaurant and get some wine. i drink my wine, and then end up finishing some of hers too. she was visibly drunk as she is a light weight. for me, i felt ""tipsy"" yet 1 hour after i felt sober again."
Concerta and Alcohol ,"I have totally heard this. Because of the amphetamine in it, you can drink like a fish and get alcohol toxicity very easily because you don’t feel drunk until you are way behind being drunk."
Concerta and Alcohol ,No amphetamine in concerta fyi
Concerta and Alcohol ,Same shit different day. Methylphenidate CNS stimulant.
Concerta and Alcohol ,"Also, you will test positive for amphetamines on a drug test with concerta."
Concerta and Alcohol ,Day and night for some of us actually. Also it’s called a FALSE positive for a reason.
Concerta and Alcohol ,We as the talking about drinking and concerta. Not anything else. The question was regarding drinking and alcohol just in case you forgot to read the heading…
11 yr old takes 72 mg possibly going up to 90 mg? ,"Does he take the whole dose in the morning? I find I get an early crash so I take 1-2 ritalin boosters in the afternoon and evening to stay focused. If it's wearing off really early for him, possibly a second pill taken later in the day would be a better answer than increasing the morning dosage.

I don't find that increasing the dosage of a single concerta pill actually causes it to last that much longer. It just makes the initial peak higher and the crash worse at a certain point, and increases my anxiety.

I'd see if he does better on a lower dose spaced out throughout the day (ie, two concerta at a lower dose, taken morning and afternoon, rather than one at a much higher dose)"
11 yr old takes 72 mg possibly going up to 90 mg? ,"I'm not a doctor but 90mg of Concerta seams too high for an 11 year old. The maximum dose where I live is 72mg for adults. Stimulants can have serious health consequences for children down the line. Maybe you should have further medical checks for your son (pituitary gland issues come to mind) or maybe have him screened for ASD or ODD.
I wish you the best and hope your son finds a treatment that helps him thrive and be healthy"
11 yr old takes 72 mg possibly going up to 90 mg? ,"These are probably questions for your kid’s doctor.

It sounds good that you’re screening him in case of other health concerns.

As for additional meds, I think strattera might be an option. Maybe wellbutrin or intuniv. Not sure if any of these are okay for kids though. 

Also some people experience a significant difference in brand name concerta vs generic. It can be a real thing with this med. Seems to depend on the specific generic and also the specific person. Caution, if you google, you may find horror stories of people swearing the generic is straight garbage. It’s not, please take that with a grain of salt. Truth is some generics work perfectly great for some people, myself included. But, it is true that some generics do not work as well in some bodies. So, it’s possible that brand name could work better for your son. 

If you’re looking for other things to think about, here’s a list of random things to consider. Overall you are the parent and you know your kid best, this is just a list to brainstorm with. 

It is okay to get a second opinion and/or see a specialist.

If medication is through a general/family doctor, consider if seeing a psychiatrist with experience with ADHD might be of benefit.

Consider if therapy (like talk therapy) might be of benefit. (If your insurance covers it, there’s not much downside in trying it out imo.)

Consider if other support services might be beneficial: Adhd support groups, organizing help, school tutors.

Consider nutrition: particularly protein and water. An easy way to check that box as an adult is to have a protein shake at breakfast. Not sure if kids can do that. If not maybe even just a glass of milk? Greek yogurt? Smoothie? Especially if they don’t currently eat breakfast, or eat simple carbs like poptarts. Protein seems to help (I think it contains construction materials for dopamine) and water is needed to help the pill absorb best.

Consider if exercise might benefit & if it’s possible add some in. Exercise is supposed to be beneficial for a ton of mental health stuff, physical health stuff, and ADHD in particular. (People with ADHD may fidgety or be hyperactive because movement can generate dopamine). Perhaps get the whole family involved so it doesn’t feel like he’s being “punished” with exercise. Or maybe there is an older cousin or uncle who might take him under his wing at the gym etc. 

Consider if either parent(s) or sibling(s) might benefit from being screened for ADHD, as it has a strong genetic component. 

Consider if medication break(s) might be beneficial. For both tolerance and overall health (I think height can be slightly impacted long-term).

Consider that he’ll be hitting his teens in a few years, and might be more interested in building muscle or playing team sports or whatever teen boys get interested in these days. 

Along with, hitting his teens in a few years, comes with bigger emotions, school responsibilities, social navigation, etc. So starting to work on skills with a therapist etc beginning now might really have a big impact especially as the years go on. 

“Pills don’t make skills”. I’m a big believer in medication, but I’m also a believer in non-med supports and strategies. My opinion is they are two separate halves of a whole. I don’t think any amount of therapy or homework strategies can replace meds. But I also think there is a very real place for therapy and deliberate skill building and strategies.

Medication gives me the ability to use a lot more “tools”. But I still gotta learn about the tools, how to use them, and then actually use them. Meds without skills are like working arms but not having a hammer (or having a hammer but not knowing how to use it). Can’t get the nail in. Therapy/skills without meds is like having a great hammer and knowing exactly how and when to use it, but having no arms or t-rex arms or arms that don’t really work. Still can’t get the nail in. Need to have good arms & a good hammer to get stuff done. That’s what I mean by two separate halves of a whole & that one doesn’t replace the other. 

Sorry for this got too long. Good luck!"
11 yr old takes 72 mg possibly going up to 90 mg? ,"He's not the only one even with us adults who struggle on Concerta due to it not lasting the full day what I advise is to get him on IR I'm on 70 to 80mg a day split in dosages dependent on what I have lined up for the day and I hardly ever get crashes the only con I would say is regular reminders of taking the meds I have read studies that say you would need the effects of the drug to be at steady amount in your plasma for maximum therapeutic effects so due to this I've noticed if I do miss a dose I can have hyperactive rebounds 

Intreasting to read as I'm very sure one of my little ones has ADHD but not sure as parent how I will exactly tackle it right now just using certain techniques to help remind them and reminding myself of what I went through but will look to see a psychiatrist on the near future keeping close eye on em."

11 yr old takes 72 mg possibly going up to 90 mg? ,"I guess it would be better to take the same dosage, and take a booster dose os Ritalin IR at the end of the effects (He being a kid and maybe couldn't describe very well where the meds seems to wear off); Also, you're the parent, you should control his diet - he actually can eat as much as he want, if the food isn't highly caloric dense. If eating a clean diet, like fruits, veggies, lean meats, integral rice, etc. Plus doing physical activities will help the ADHD and the weight problem. (I'm saying all this, but I don't know what he does or doesn't and what he eats). In the book ADHD 2.0: New Science and Essential Strategies for Thriving with Distraction - from Childhood Through Adulthood; You can see the doctors talking about how certain types of activities will help in ADHD.  
Taking that behavioral activities plus Ritalin IR probably will help, rather then upping the dosage.  
Because the mechanism of the extended release will be the same, It will have a higher dosage for every hour or the release, and consequentially a higher plasmatic dosage at the end of the tail, making it slighty more active for more time. But taking a IR will certainly make it effective. If the dosage is actually fine during the time it's active."
11 yr old takes 72 mg possibly going up to 90 mg? ,72 is the last dose for a lot of concerta patients
11 yr old takes 72 mg possibly going up to 90 mg? ,What about Jornay (methylphenidate hydrochloride)? You take it at night but it doesn’t release and kick in till morning and It’s supposed to last all day.. 10hrs.
11 yr old takes 72 mg possibly going up to 90 mg? ,"I had the same experience with Vyvanse and Concerta, it even wears off at the same time of day you mentioned. Just want to echo the other comments recommending adding Ritalin IR mid-day - and the protein and electrolytes! It's pretty common that people need to add it as a booster and he might not have to necessarily even increase the Concerta dosage."
11 yr old takes 72 mg possibly going up to 90 mg? ,Maybe you should ask for adderral I know it definitely helps with focusing at school since he is losing focus? Just thought I would put that one out there. We just started on 18 mg of Concerta my daughter is in the 6th grade and Dr upped her dose to 27 mg due to her still being hyper active and still getting in trouble at school. Noticed she hasn’t been able to sleep and is hyper focused on her phone. I hope you find something that works 💕👍
11 yr old takes 72 mg possibly going up to 90 mg? ,I’m 26 and my heart is falling apart on 72mg. I don’t think its healthy. I would suggest to take a week break then go back to the original dose. This is not okay
11 yr old takes 72 mg possibly going up to 90 mg? ,"hey i’ve been on 90mg for just under a year and was on 72 for a few months before. ive also tried lisdexamfetamine (vyvanse) before but that had no impact on me (went up to 70 and back). although on the concerta leaflets it tends to say the maximum daily dose is 72, you can go up to 108 (at least in the uk in line with the bnf/nice guidelines, and naturally it’s best not to be on such high doses if possible).

everyone’s experiences are different obviously but for me 90 helped a little more but i think i’ve kinda plateaued now. my psych suggested splitting my dose which may help with the wearing off effect so i take 54 when i wake up and then 36 around noon – might be something to try ?"
11 yr old takes 72 mg possibly going up to 90 mg? ,"Sounds scary for a pediatric dose, but he is bigger than I am. There is a 27mg pill, and I actually use them (doing 54 on weekends, 72mg usual workdays and 81/90 if I really need to concentrate, 90 certainly is a bit too much after a break, and 72mg every day stopped working that well after several months). Might ask to try elvanse when it's time to renew, but I am benefitting from Concerta. Kid just went back to Medikinet CR (50/50 IR and delayed), much happier now!"
11 yr old takes 72 mg possibly going up to 90 mg? ,"He’s a child, this is way above Reddit’s pay grade. Particularly if he has other mental health issues or possible physical issues going on."
11 yr old takes 72 mg possibly going up to 90 mg? ,"For what is worth, I take 108 mg. I started at 18 mg and worked up to this dosage, after some months of trial, with my psychiatrist 
I am 63 now and have been on for approximately 2 years. 

108 gives me a good 12 hours of clarity. I am told that this is not an uncommon dosage for adults and that there are higher doses. I can’t imagine how different my life would have been if I had been diagnosed and medicated at a young age. 

Blessings on you and your son. 🙏"
11 yr old takes 72 mg possibly going up to 90 mg? ,"i was diagnosed at young age and took the highest doses possible for a preteen/teen for years. (I was also always underweight) I trialed many different meds like vyvanse, ritalin, aderall, focalin, just to name a few… when one med’s highest dose wasn’t effective anymore, we’d switch to another medicine. I’m an adult now, taking 27mg concerta, and one thing I wished my parents did differently for me was less dosage adjustment, more adhd guidance/counseling, more adhd-child appropriate behavioral guidance and understanding, and more learning how to accept the things that come with adhd. The super high doses helped with some things, sure, but when the meds weren’t effective enough and the doses couldn’t be pushed any higher, it felt frustrating and a little hopeless."
11 yr old takes 72 mg possibly going up to 90 mg? ,I’d suggest you look into dexmethylphenidate/focalin XR
11 yr old takes 72 mg possibly going up to 90 mg? ,"I used to take 90mg of Concerta and metabolize it very quickly. Based on my personal experience, here are a couple of suggestions that have helped me:
	•	I started taking L-Tyrosine, which made a significant difference. I take 500mg in the morning with my Concerta and another 500mg at lunchtime.
	•	This adjustment allowed me to lower my Concerta dose to 54mg and add 10mg of Ritalin in the afternoon.

When I was on 90mg, I experienced a strong urge to eat sugary snacks as the medication wore off in the afternoon. While that urge isn’t completely gone now, it’s much more manageable!

For context, I’m 39 years old, 6ft tall, and weigh about 200 lbs."
11 yr old takes 72 mg possibly going up to 90 mg? ,"Diverse opinion, does he know who he is without medication? 
It must be rough. Sorry for his experiences"
11 yr old takes 72 mg possibly going up to 90 mg? ,"I actually like the idea of possibly splitting it! I’m wondering if I could give them a 36 or even a 54 in the morning and then having him take a lower dose in the afternoon to see if that would help. it doesn’t really affect his sleep. Sometimes he will say I think I’m gonna need a melatonin tonight but most times he’s able to fall asleep. So I will bring this to the attention of his doctor and see if maybe we could try that. I do know why take Concerta and instead of taking it as soon as I wake up sometimes I take it as soon as I get to work or on my drive to work knowing that it’s going to last the day, but then I crashed by the time I get home and then I can’t get anything done at home lol"
11 yr old takes 72 mg possibly going up to 90 mg? ,Same. Higher dose of concerta for me didn't work. Ritalin worked much better. The downside is having to take it every 4 hours. I just don't want to. For no reason.. even though it makes me calmer/relaxed/lower heart rate... It's like i feel forced to have energy/do more etc and some days I don't want to 😑 thanks brain 
11 yr old takes 72 mg possibly going up to 90 mg? ,"Yeah, it sounds like the kid has something other than ADHD going on as well. Not saying he doesn’t have ADHD, but there’s probably something else too."
11 yr old takes 72 mg possibly going up to 90 mg? ,His weight (89kg) and high metabolism are probably the culprit. Not saying he should increase yet. Maybe run some tests to check his heart rate/blood pressure etc
11 yr old takes 72 mg possibly going up to 90 mg? ,"So sorry! I had appointments galore today for his siblings as well! He does have ODD, and SPD. No he doesn’t have ASD. I work with ASD children and know what to look for in that sense, but he sees a regular paediatric doctor only not a family doctor technically that’s his and his sisters family doctor. 
We do have a family history of ADHD, as well as ODD. Out of 5 children 4 are diagnosed with one that is being assessed right now. Father, grandmother and uncles all have it. I was recently diagnosed as of last year I was just the chatty Kathy in school. 
He does get breaks from his medication. That is why we are getting bloodwork to check different possible issues. His doctor is wondering if it could be pituitary, diabetes and a bunch of other things.  No he’s not on any other medication he was on intuitive for a little bit, but it did cause low blood pressure and a few fainting spells and we took him off."
11 yr old takes 72 mg possibly going up to 90 mg? ,Yes but it is dependent on weight of the patient
11 yr old takes 72 mg possibly going up to 90 mg? ,"Hey, thanks for the comment! Wellbutrin most times you have to be 18 years old. I do have my one daughter on it who is 17 but she had to go to a psychiatrist because with her ADHD anything that she went on it caused her anxiety and depression to go absolutely nuts and so she could not do a stimulant. 
So he sees paediatric doctor (child specialist) especially every three months and not just a family doctor. (In a sense it’s his family doctor, it a practice with four other paediatricians) he does have four older sisters, three of which have been diagnosed with ADHD as well as ODD and SPD, which he has also been diagnosed with. His sister is in the process of being diagnosed with ADHD as well. She was just more of an inattentive type that sadly with the others I missed. 

As for the medication itself, he will only prescribe the Concerta namebrand. He will not prescribe the generic. So that’s a plus. 

I do appreciate the talk therapy. He does see someone I looked into that just recently because my ex and I separated, and they were young, but I realize that sometimes, even though they were young, they still needed some sort of guidance that I was not able to give them.  The one that they see, she does deal with the nervous system and tries to get them to understand their own nervous system and why their bodies react the way they do, especially having ADHD! 

I will try and figure out the breakfast part ! I work about 45 minutes away before he leaves for school so I don’t know exactly what he has for breakfast half the time or if he has breakfast! so if I give him a protein shake before I leave hopefully that could help! We have talked about portion control and not in a bad way just how it’s OK to have all foods just we need to balance it with our proteins and vegetables/fruits etc. 

The crazy part is with him he is pretty active . Don’t get me wrong. He does play on his video games, but we do have a park in a basketball court and a soccer net behind us and he’s always outside. And he does play sports in the summer, the winter is a little bit more tough for us here in Canada he’s not really into hockey lol But he does like taking the dogs for walks. 

Medication breaks - this one I don’t really give it to him in the summer. There are days that I do days that I don’t. in the winter time I tend to every day while he has school he definitely takes it, on the weekends if there’s something I need him to be able to focus he will take it but most weekends he doesn’t take it. 

I truly appreciate your big comment. It really put things into perspective for me and allowed me to take a step back into what I am doing and not doing and what I need to work on a little bit more!"
11 yr old takes 72 mg possibly going up to 90 mg? ,"I believe the highest dose is 108mg? I think with his weight and his height and the way he metabolizes his medication that that is why the doctor is willing to up it. ? He did say that before he were to put him up, he wants to get all the blood work done and he would send him for an ECG which he does every 6 months"
11 yr old takes 72 mg possibly going up to 90 mg? ,Thank you! I’ll look into this!
11 yr old takes 72 mg possibly going up to 90 mg? ,"He does know who he is without medication.. he gets medication breaks through the summer, on weekend etc. clearly the medication isn’t working long enough through the day, that he knows what unmediated him is like. What’s rough is having your child cry because he thinks he’s stupid because he can’t finish his homework or his work in class, or his desk is so messy he can’t find anything so he misses recess to clean it out instead of being with friends. Go somewhere else with your less than helpful “opinion”"
11 yr old takes 72 mg possibly going up to 90 mg? ,"Is he on other psychiatric medications as well? Or other medications in general? Some medications can counteract the effects of Concerta, if not he can try splitting the dose during the day so the effect can last longer"
11 yr old takes 72 mg possibly going up to 90 mg? ,Yeah it is but Im just saying that it is rare. Also you are so fucking lucky you got him diagnosed so young
11 yr old takes 72 mg possibly going up to 90 mg? ,I'm very sorry it is a struggle for you both. I hope something can be found to help him 🙏
11 yr old takes 72 mg possibly going up to 90 mg? ,"I really am! When I left the hospital with my 2nd oldest (she’s 15 now) I had him as paediatrician check her out before we left and he offered to be her and her sister’s family doctor. He now sees all five of my children , and I know how rare it truly is to have a child specialist as a family doctor for them . My sister has tried to get in to see him through referrals for specific things and it takes months!"
11 yr old takes 72 mg possibly going up to 90 mg? ,You are very lucky to have a child specialist as a family doctor indeed. He sounds like a good doctor
Addiction,"Methylphenidate has been shown in studies to increase nicotine use in those who smoke/vape. I've also experienced the same effect, no longer wish/crave to smoke cannabis but have increased cravings for nicotine."
Addiction,I’ve never had a nicotine addiction so I have no advice to offer on that end. Just commenting to say I’m relieved to see I am not the only one who hasn’t had any urges to smoke weed since starting concerta.

Addiction,"Weird, I’m smoking weed almost every night now (mostly to deal with the crash) which I never did before I started concerta this month.

Addiction,Was never into cannabis really but I use to smoke. 15 years ago they didn’t warn you not to drink or smoke on these meds and I definitely smoked and a lot.  Worse if I EVER had a drink.  I have been quit almost 10 years now and the urge is completely gone.
Addiction,"For me Methylphenidate had the opposite effect, it help me to quit weed as well to quit nicotine from vaping and stopping vaping. I've read multiple subs here talking about how Methylphenidate increased nicotine cravings but for me was different."
Addiction,You can not get addicted to smoking weed.
Addiction,"Must be something to do with dopamine. Smoking nicotine/vape stimulates dopamine but weed doesn't I guess.

OP if you want to quit something that is a big dopamine hit, you have to replace it with another. Which means some kind of hobby you really enjoy, usually. But I smoked for a decade, I know it's not easy. Good luck."
Addiction,This explains alot.  And ironically Wellbutrin made me want to smoke more!
Addiction,"That’s great to hear, cheers to healing!!"
Addiction,Agreed! I smoked 🍃very regularly before starting Concerta but found that when I combined the two I would get really anxious and fatigued. Did not mix well for me
Addiction,"Same here, instead of weed I now use Propanolol and it's significantly better"
Addiction,Ηave you been taking concerta for 10 years now? How is that like? I started it 2 weeks ago and I’m worried it will stop working or that I won’t be able to take it for a long time.
Addiction,"You can psychologically. It can be a mental thing! 
However physically, not really."
Addiction,"You're so wrong, your endocannabinoid system changes and, when you quit, it takes a month (minimum) to restore. Also other parts of the nervous system make changes as serotonin, gaba, glutamate, dopamine.... So of course weed cause physical dependence and psychological too. Other thing is that dependence is lower when compared to other substances as nicotine or opioid but it is real and exist."
Addiction,"Oh okay, thank you for kindly telling me!"
Addiction,"No worries !
Yeah, not many people know and thats alright ! It can turn into a dependency when people use it to help with mental health issues and self medicate. When it actually *helps* them, like any prescribed med, its not really an addiction. However, when it effects them badly, and they still feel that dependency, urges, etc. to smoke, thats an addiction. However its completely mental and can be worked through w/ therapy, and your body won’t get physically addicted to it."
Addiction,Kinda wild to make a bold statement like that without being fully informed
Addiction,Okay so kind of like placebos in clinical trials?
Lifestyle changes you needed to do - Need advice,I just started so i dont have that much of a answer for you but it sounds like going to the gym could solve(or atleast help) both your problems. I also lost a bit of apetite but im always hungry after lifting some weights. I also sleep alot better.
Lifestyle changes you needed to do - Need advice,"A few things I would recommend:

- Always eat first thing in the morning - even if you’re not hungry (before you take the medication) and make sure it’s a filling breakfast with plenty of protein otherwise you’ll struggle. I found that when I started skipping breakfast in the morning it made it difficult to eat any other meals during the day (but that might be personal to me). 

- I find exercise a very good way of combatting the eating thing (although I try never go shopping after a gym workout as I just want to but the shop I’m so hungry - again might just be me). 

- Exercise during the day and wind down techniques at night could also help with your bed time routine and it could help you get a decent nights sleep - things like reading before bed, no electronic devices an hour or two before bed, maybe some mindfulness or yoga etc…

- If the crash is rough then maybe ask your doctor about an instant release methylphenidate tablet you can take when you fell like you’re crashing (I took this for a while but found eventually that I didn’t need it)."
Lifestyle changes you needed to do - Need advice,"Sleep & food matter a lot. These aren’t little problems. They are big ones.

I’ll suggest weekly therapy appointments. Then you have someone to bounce ideas off of & holds you accountable to trying them out since you’ll see them next week to let them know how it went. If the first idea(s) don’t work, keep trying.

5 hours of sleep a night & unintentionally losing 2lbs a week is unhealthy, unsustainable, & a big problem.

Additionally, many feel that concerta works a lot better when properly slept & fed. 

You might also consider going back to 36mg. If you can eat/sleep well on that dose, the overall benefit you get might feel the same."

Lifestyle changes you needed to do - Need advice,"my intention is to start going to the gym for this reason too. i found having long walks help with the appetite and sleep issue. also with the postcrash doom.

OP, sucks having messy patterns and not being able to enjoy eating or sleeping only makes it more difficult, but maybe a bit of movement could help you. 50 minutes of walking in the park usually helps me.

also consider lowering your dose. i had to do it. it's not funny when your performance at work worsens but health is priority. it's uncomfortable saying the following because shouldn't be the main point but... if you don't take care, you won't be able to work either way."

And knowing myself, if I ask them to check on me and push me to do many things, I\`ll just get aversion to therapy. Since it\`s already so hard to find someone you like, I want to stick with this one for now. So I\`m trying to find ways to trick myself and hold myself accountable. Some people around me; partner, friends, family kind of took on the job to try to hold me accountable and it is better than nothing but in the end it is easy to just say people what they want to hear but do what you want to do anyway. So I need to put self-imposed ways in place.

  
Yeah, might be worth lowering the dose I guess. Appetite thing wasn't this bad at lower doses. Thanks!"
Lifestyle changes you needed to do - Need advice,"Definitely worth a try, thanks! Problem with trying to get healthy patterns is I work to establish things for months, push myself, settle on a rhythm more or less working. Then something unexpected happens, a work trip, super stressful situation etc. Then bam! back to square one."
Memory loss on concerta,"No Concerta at Chemist 4U this month, so my clinician’s suggestions were Medikinet XR or Xaggitin.

Starting tomorrow and I’m nervous ,Good luck! If anything Concerta helps me focus more and better apply what I learnt doing CBT. Hope your experience will be similar
Starting tomorrow and I’m nervous ,Will do thank you!! :)
Starting tomorrow and I’m nervous ,OP never said they had BPD. Not sure how you gathered that.
Starting tomorrow and I’m nervous ,I saw NO increase***
Starting tomorrow and I’m nervous ,"Just totally made an assumption, did I offend you?"
Starting tomorrow and I’m nervous ,That makes me feel better actually thank you. I’m gonna be on vacation starting tomorrow until the 15th and gonna be my first weeks on Concerta. I hope my moods swings don’t increase as well! That would be perfect
Starting tomorrow and I’m nervous ,I understand how you came up with your assumption but also it was assumed so my comment was made for clarification. Thank you
Starting tomorrow and I’m nervous ,No I was just pointing out the fact. No offense
I feel like I never eat…,"It’s good that you identified that you might just be “hangry” and are incorporating smoothies to supplement. I feel like how you described as I come off of Concerta too. It helped when I upped my dosage. If you have a fast metabolism, maybe you would be better with 18mg 2x a day? I feel like you should be able to enjoy your evening as you wind down not just completely crash and burn."
I feel like I never eat…,[deleted]
I feel like I never eat…,"Most of us struggle with it.  There's no cheat code. You just have to manage it.

One thing that really helps is a HUGE breakfast full of protein.  Pack as much nutrition into it as you can, because it's the last meal you'll WANT to eat.  Figure out what doesn't make you nauseous and eat a lot of it.

Then at dinnertime, you just gotta do some math on what you ate, figure out what you're short on, and eat it.  Nobody's going to do it for you, especially if you're a woman.  Men get past this by having wives who will feed them like literal children, but that's never going to work for you.

I will say this, though... It's highly likely that your lack of eating is why you're needing such a high dose of methylphenidate, and most certainly causing the bad crashes.  This drug needs to be fed to work properly.  If you're not feeding it, you get reduced benefits and increased side effects."
I feel like I never eat…,Damn. Try to take the pills with some food. Breakfast is an important meal. For me its quite the opposite. I need to eat otherwise i wont function properly
I feel like I never eat…,"I can first state intermittent fasting is not only not bad for you but can be good. As long as you are not on a massive caloric deficit. 

Taking protein shakes is great. Other things I do are: 
- Taking a 2-3 days break on Saturday, Sunday and some Fridays. Ensuring I eat a lot those days
- Making sure I eat whole foods with high protein and fiber content. So won’t waste meals on ultra processed garbage.
- Take supplements. Aminoacids, vitamins and antioxidants
- Have lower doses (36 and 18) for lighter days that allow me to increase my caloric intake

I am a 34 female and my weight usually fluctuates between 109 and 119 pounds depending on how much muscle mass I have. I am lean, but that is how humans should be. I can still climb 13K mountains faster than 20 year olds, do 1 hour of pilates daily and cycle to and from work.

Even doing IF, being vegetarian and with a relative caloric deficit my diet has kept me healthy, focused and mobile. If you are able to achieve that then it works for you."
I feel like I never eat…,"You literally need to just treat eating like it’s a chore. Set times that you want to eat each day and make sure you do, that’s the best way around it. It will be a struggle but you will feel better for it"
I feel like I never eat…,"Oh I have the Same Problem. What helps me is that I go with my uni collegues to Lunch at 12pm every day. That way it would be weird for me to not eat and I can usually eat a little bit 

For Breakfast I force myself to have Toast and I habe a reminder on my phone to est breakfast. I hope this helps in a way, I hate eating while on concerta but it's manageable after sometime and eating with other people helped me a lot"
I feel like I never eat…,"Unfortunately it's just a side effect of taking any stimulant medication, stimulants are appetite suppressants so you kind of need to learn to manage it"
I feel like I never eat…,"I work from home most days so I just tell myself I have to raid the fridge no later than 1pm. It does seem weirdly easier to eat, like I don’t have to want the food it just has to be edible for me. Make sure you’re packing a lunch or making food easily and quickly available to yourself throughout the day. 

I know it seems obvious but set yourself an alarm, have another shake if you need, but essentially you see the results and they aren’t positive so lean into the concerta to just mechanically fuel your meat suit once more a day is the best way I can describe it."
I feel like I never eat…,"I try to eat something every 2 hours, even something small, and even if I don’t feel like it."
I feel like I never eat…,"Just gotta force yourself to eat, it gets easier the longer you take it.   I'm on 81mg a day and weigh the most I ever have in my life"

I feel like I never eat…,"i think im alone in this but concerta (27 mg)  makes me WAY hungrier than ever. literally everyone else is like ""concerta kills your apptetite"" meanwhile my stomach became bottomless pit

this is not normal though cause 10 mins ago i ate 5 green olives which had lemon flavor.. and fat inside olive does not get into blood this fast.. i ate lots of carb before and felt like i ate nothing... but 5 olives makes me feel better lul

so something that gives you soury/lemony taste can work"
I feel like I never eat…,I have to tell myself to eat for fuel not for hunger 🫠
I feel like I never eat…,"Not sure if this is best, and I’m on Vyvanse not Concerta - but I tend to eat small amounts throughout the day which keeps my blood sugar steady and prevents me from feeling super “hungry” at night. Again hunger though is a weird one - for me it’s just a general sense that some food might help me feel better. Probably why a lot of ADHDers end up just calculating and sometimes getting EDs. Sometimes it helps planning ahead and just making sure I’m incorporating both decent nutrition and some things I actually like."
I feel like I never eat…,"Despite my Dr pushing me repeatedly to go up I've never tolerated more than 18mg. It's the baby dose and it doesn't ""fix"" me, but ask yourself if you're actually broken before you take high doses of meds. 

Our brains work how they work and stimulants kind of just mask the difference. It has downsides as well and you can lose your strengths. 

I did my PhD entirely off my meds and honestly it was better because I followed my rabbit holes. I hyperfocused. I didn't read my mail or make my bed or anything of that junk but I enjoyed what I was doing and finished in 3 years 3 months with a good publication set (many people go 5, even 7 years). 

I take the baby dose so I can get all of the boring stuff done, but it's getting easier and easier with more tech. My bills are all auto paid. My email inbox is prioritised and even reminds me when I haven't followed up yet. I can speak reminders to my phone in the 2 sec they are in my brain. Alexa shouts things at me. My phone will even tell me based on traffic when I should leave for an appointment. Basically you can have AI executive function these days. 

I would look at whether *you* want the things that high meds bring or whether it's some expectation pushed on you. Are you unhappy and struggling with your ADHD because of you or because of old fashioned expectations in society? 

I do think the tide is turning and it's more and more ok to ask others to meet you half way. E.g. even a decade ago I would never have told anyone I had ADHD. Fast forward to 2022, I told my boss a couple months in about it and explained how I experience certain things. 

At some point, he had a mild complaint from a person we were working with about me interrupting with questions a lot. I'm doing machine learning and mathematical modelling and I have a lot of questions and my ADHD makes me blurt them out sometimes (again tech helps because when it's online I can turn my microphone off and nobody hears me blurt out questions and I then remember to write them down and wait instead). 

Anyway, he explained to this person that I am very engaged in the work and excited and very thorough and those things are strengths and he would ask me to do my best not to interrupt, but he asked her to consider the fact that I'm not changing the subject but rather really excited and interested in what she's saying.  He explained I was aware of my tendency and that I try to control it, but if I don't it's because  I really want to work with her to solve her problem. He didn't mention ADHD because he didn't have my permission to. He told me about this in a private meeting.  After that, I tried really extra hard and she genuinely seemed less annoyed when I lost control and the project ended up winning awards. If I drugged myself up to the point where I couldn't stomach anything but candy, I wouldn't have interrupted but I also wouldnt have had all of the ideas that made the project really successful. 

I would say try a much lower dose, set up your AI executive function and see if *you're* ok being you. And if people around you aren't ok with it, ask them to adjust their expectations half way."
I feel like I never eat…,"I also feel the lack of apetite and by the end of the day my stomach feels hungry but I don't have hunger haha. What I do is I make sure I eat a good breakfast before taking the pill. For lunch I'm NEVER hungry, sometimes I barely eat lunch but I try to always eat something. Around the dinner time the drug wears off and I am hungry again, and I make sure to compensate with a good meal high in nutrients"
I feel like I never eat…,"Exactly, just wanna relax! I will definitely look into your suggestion though! Sounds like the possibility of a good lunch at least."
I feel like I never eat…,"""I tend to be very irritable and have horrible brain fog and fatigue""

you want this? why are you being invalidating and minimalizing now? is it too fun and quirky to you? you think our struggle is a joke? im literally irritated and shaking and then i read someone saying ""uwu why i dont have dis 😭😭😭"""
I feel like I never eat…,RIGHT?! 😭
I feel like I never eat…,I do take my weekends off as well and tend to eat a lot then but I will definitely keep the dosage in mind. this entire experience has kind of forced me to relearn my entire system which has been great for so many reasons but also so frustrating at times. which is why i wanted to post here. Its very reassuring that I'm not the only one who is constantly counting how many calories I need to fit into my dinner/afternoon to remain a functioning human.
I feel like I never eat…,"> Nobody's going to do it for you, especially if you're a woman. Men get past this by having wives who will feed them like literal children, but that's never going to work for you.

Nothing like some casual sexism. Maybe don't assume that men ""get feed like literal children""."
I feel like I never eat…,"Same.. I HAVE to eat on Concerta or else I feel awful. Stomach pain, nausea, irritability. I don't necessarily get hungry, but when I start feeling yucky, I know it's time for me to eat and then I'm usually okay again. Lol"
I feel like I never eat…,When I take a day off from my meds y appetite is crazyyyyy but only on the days off
I feel like I never eat…,"There are others who also eat more on Concerta. There are some who have a real issue with finding an appetite, and there are some who have both, where they don't have an appetite while the meds are active but binge because they feel like they're starving when it wears off. I'm one of the no appetite/no binging people. It's a drag. I used to like food, and now I don't care, plus I have less energy because I don't eat properly. It's such a balancing act."
I feel like I never eat…,A magnesium supplement can help with the crash.
I feel like I never eat…,This.
I feel like I never eat…,"It's definitely frustrating, because methylphenidate requires lifestyle changes to really work well, and they're all things that are hard for most ADHDers to do naturally.

The upside is that the three things that make it work (sleep, exercise and protein) are all mega healthy things that make you feel better anyway so once you get it right it's easier to keep it going."
I feel like I never eat…,LOOOOL BUSTED.. she edited her comment lul
I feel like I never eat…,"Imagine pretending that a typical relationship doesn't have the wife cooking and preparing meals for the family, including the husband."
I feel like I never eat…,"I'm a man and I cook for my family as much or more than my wife does. Even if what you said were true that in a ""typical relationship"", the wife cooks the meals, they way you worded it in your original post, ""feed them like literal children"", sounds like you're bitter from personal experience. Just admit it, what you said was sexist."

New to Concerta/stims -- looking for support / feedback,"Stick with it for at least a week.  The side effects disappear for most.  If they don't, then think about switching it up.

In the meantime, also be looking at the 3 pillars of methylphenidate:  Sleep, protein and exercise.

If you're not doing those three things in good amounts, this drug will do you dirty.  The side effects get greatly amplified and lots of the benefits just stop working."

HELP! Concerta hallucinations ,"It was dark outside. You probably had a crash which can make you anxious. Those most likely were not hallucinations, but your mind playing tricks and jumping to the worst case scenario. Been there done that"
HELP! Concerta hallucinations ,"Sounds more like anxiety. Those are normal blood pressure readings - tho you need to know how to take them & space them apart for accuracy.

When my doctor checks my pulse, it goes high due to my anxiety with doctors. Pulse rates fluctuate and that’s normal. 

You should work on managing stress and anxiety such as with short guided meditations or even eft tapping. These can centre you & help your body find calm again."
HELP! Concerta hallucinations ,"It could be just anxiety, but I’d recommend bring that up to your doctor asap. Its better to be safe. If it causes you to hallucinate you shouldn’t be on that medication, but if its just anxiety and your mind playing tricks on you, thats a different thing. Either way, its best to bring it up to your psychiatrist, especially if you keep having these experiences."

What is your Concerta dosage?,"I take 36mg.
18 and 27 did nothing for me. But 36mg has worked well almost without side effects, only dry mouth."
What is your Concerta dosage?,I’m on 18 mg X 2 a day.  My days start really early at 3:30 am.  So by lunchtime that dose is gone it feels like.  So I had my Dr and she told me to take another dose at lunchtime.  Seems to be better but I feel like I need a 27 mg.
What is your Concerta dosage?,"i take 36, i’ve taken each dose up to 54 and i’ve found 36 is the sweet spot !"
What is your Concerta dosage?,27mg when i wake up and 18mg around noon !
What is your Concerta dosage?,"I’ve started at 18 mg and after a number of months, settled at 108 mg. It gives me a good 12 hours of brain clarity daily. Also, I eat a protein shake in the morning around the time of ingestion

Edit: 3 x 36mg"
What is your Concerta dosage?,"I only started around 6 weeks ago and am on 27mg. This seems a good dose for me and my productivity snd mood have improved a lot. I’m also taking Wellbutrin 150mg slow release, which I take with the concerts around 9:30am.

I’m surprised that people take 50..60..80+mg a day. I feel a little wired just on 27mg sometimes!"
What is your Concerta dosage?,72mg in the morning and a 10-20mg short acting at 5pm
What is your Concerta dosage?,"36mg Concerta in the morning
5mg Booster (Medikinet) in the afternoon 

Based on my weight - my Dr can’t prescribe 54mg."
What is your Concerta dosage?,"To me it’s 72 that works and i still feel it’s bot enough at all, my doctor prescribes me resperidone to help as well alongside it for that reason"
What is your Concerta dosage?,On a regular day when i'm at school and/or working I take 36mg in the morning and 18mg later in the day.
What is your Concerta dosage?,Im on 36
What is your Concerta dosage?,"I started with 54 due to the mg for kg of weight. After about 6 years I chatted with my doctor to lower it. I now do 36 mg on normal work days and 18 mg on “social” work days (e.g. international trips, summits, fridays, etc)"
What is your Concerta dosage?,I tried all except 72mg (not available in my country) and I would choose 36mg for the effect but I stay in 27mg because is more tolerable and still being effective.
What is your Concerta dosage?,"54 with a 5 in the evening, it’s worked great for me."
What is your Concerta dosage?,[removed]
What is your Concerta dosage?,This is really interesting. I\`m on 54mg for the last 2 months. It had great effects initially but recently it\`s not as good as before. Though my sleep schedule was horrible this last month. Didn\`t know it can have an effect. Do you know if this is common with others as well?
What is your Concerta dosage?,Oh wow
What is your Concerta dosage?,"Same, but 54 am and 27 at noon"
What is your Concerta dosage?,18 doubled the dosage is 36 MG
What is your Concerta dosage?,You should probably talk to your doctor about trying a different medication out. As far as I know feeling like a zombie is not the desired effect. Personally I felt clear and calm and present once I started on 18MG and it increased as the dose did
What is your Concerta dosage?,"i'm on medikinet (basically the same as ritalin) and i didn't felt 10mg, 20mg decently and 30mg then seemed around the right ammout, but it makes me zombie like a few hours in and lasts only 5 hours, the come down was terrible for me with strong dysphoria, irritability and cognitive fatigue. i'm on 30mg twice a day now, which is better as it lasts pretty much the whole day and i've gotten used to the come down, it's not as bad anymore. but the zomby feeling has gotton worse i feel like, i usually get a mildly euphoric rush during the first two hours and then it's just emotionless hyperfocus for around six hours. also i noticed my thought process is not as creative anymore, i feel like i'm becoming more boring.

so all in all not quite what i've been looking for, i'll ask my psychiatrist to try out elvanse instead as that seems to produce a more natural, calm but energetic effects for many people."
What is your Concerta dosage?,Maybe they don’t suit you perhaps try elvanse
What is your Concerta dosage?,"Personally, I felt this way on 27mg brand name, but not on a 36mg or 54mg generic. I don't want to imply that brand or generic had too much to do with it, though. It may be worth requesting to give a bit of a higher dose a try, as I notice it can be easier coming from the same medication type. I would definitely bring it up with my doctor though, especially if the zombie-like feeling doesn't let up after multiple weeks, if that. I'd recommend the same advice for the amphetamine class of stimulants as well."

What is your Concerta dosage?,I read it a bit in this subreddit and then I started noticing it myself. It really feels so much stronger when I sleep more than 7 poor hours of sleep.
What is your Concerta dosage?,"Me too with Ritalin 10 x 2 topups. I split my concerta dose. I take a concerta and rit then the next concerta 3 hours later and the rit at the end about 2 pm if I have things to go at night. I also really 150mg SR buproprion, I was on 54mg of concerta b4 buproprion was added but I asked to go down as it made everything much stronger.  I love being able to split it, I get enough coverage to do dinner and then I start to wind down"
What is your Concerta dosage?,r/whoosh who woulda thunk huh?🤭
What is your Concerta dosage?,1mg per kg of weight
What is your Concerta dosage?,I’m on Wellbutrin and concerta too. I was also taking lamitrigine but I’m going to stop that one - tends to make the crash from concerta if I stay up late much worse
What is your Concerta dosage?,Oh my! I am on 54 and well over that by 10+ kg in weight. Good to know I have room to grow in dose 😅
New to ADHD Meds,"For me, it had an effect right away, although subtle. It got really quiet inside my head and I could finally just didn't stuff without procrastinating it to hell. The effect diminished a bit (been a week) but it's still there. You should talk to your doctor, the dose might be indeed too low"
New to ADHD Meds,"I started Concerta a couple months ago and I didn’t notice the day and night change that some were describing on this sub. 18 mg was not the dose for me, but I can now appreciate starting so low because, at 36 mg, I now notice the change immediately.

Another thing, if you work or are in school, that’s where you will notice the change over time. It won’t MAKE you motivated to do your daily tasks or expectations, but it will give you the silent tools necessary to stay focused once you begin the task.

Definitely tell your doctor that you aren’t noticing anything just yet as very few people stay on the lowest dose. Gradual improvement is still improvement. It’s taken me two + months to see the change for what it is."

New to ADHD Meds,I am in the same boat. I have a psychiatrist appointment in two weeks and will be asking for an increase. I don’t feel anything different on my dosage (27 mg).
New to ADHD Meds,Same here… started 18mg one week ago. Feel nothing.
New to ADHD Meds,"Try doing things that you usually struggle to get done. If it seems easier then most likely the medication is working/helping :). For me I didn’t really “feel” a change either, I just noticed that I had improved focus at work & school"
New to ADHD Meds,"Thanks for your input. I am writing a diary each day (maybe not every day 😀) to document anything I notice that’s different.
Glad the lower dose is working for you, I’m not big on taking medication, but I hope to put mechanisms in place while on meds, so that in can come off them after a while."
New to ADHD Meds,"Thanks, this gives me hope that I can improve my focus perhaps with a bigger dose. Not rushing things, I guess I had big expectations 😀"
New to ADHD Meds,"After some research I found this great podcast by 2 adhd guys one of which is an adhd specialist, which talks about how best to look at it (record anything that has changed and they can discount if it’s not related) for me it was the sweet cravings, I constantly wanted to eat sugar or sweets, that has gone since taking the concerta.
https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/talkadhd/"
New to ADHD Meds,"That’s a great idea, I have noticed (on day 5) that I no longer have an insane craving for sweets, which is nice.
Focus is still pretty crappy though at work and at home, so maybe a bigger dose?
Counter to what I’ve heard my physical symptoms of anxiety ( tight chest, shallow breathing, isolating and freezing) have calmed right down, which is great!
Task initiation is a little better too, I walked the dog without procrastinating or doing several other things first."

"Concerta and collagen supplements, do they affect the way Concerta works?","My doctor told me protein is necessary for Concerta metabolization, and I use collagen protein powder in my coffee to aid with that as I’m not a big morning eater. So my instinct is no and if it does, it should be positive if anything. This of course depends on the type of collagen supplement, so always best to check with your provider or PCP. Do try to avoid vitamin C before/when you take the Concerta though - it can decrease the intended impact."
"Concerta and collagen supplements, do they affect the way Concerta works?",Are you asking BC of EDS/HSD or something else? Do collagen supplements even work
"Concerta and collagen supplements, do they affect the way Concerta works?","The collagen powder I use contains 250 mg of vitamin C though. I try to use it after concerta wears off. I hope everything goes well I guess, haha."
"Concerta and collagen supplements, do they affect the way Concerta works?","Honestly I've taken vitamin C an hour or two after my meds and it's worked fine for me, kind of levels it out if anything. I imagine you'll be fine if you take it once your meds are past it's peak."
Side effect? ,"i am in a similar situation to you - i write and produce music in my home studio have been prescribed both 27mg and 36mg, and i use either of the two depending on how much i need to concentrate that day. i found that when im on 36mg i get more frustrated and annoyed in my creative space, i overthink things too much. 27mg is better, but the best is if i skip my medication for a day on the weekend and then have studio time. its definitely more suitable for creative tasks. i wouldnt say concerta takes away creativity, as i am still able to be creative when im on my meds, but when im on meds there's more chance i will overthink, be too serious about it, and ultimately get frustrated and give up."
Side effect? ,"I've always heard that one of the ppositives of having ADHD is a higher level of creativity, because we ""think outside the box"" more, so it makes sense to me that the medication would somewhat affect that"

Chest pain/tightness in the evening,"It's a 12 hour pill. If you're taking it at 10am, it's still going at 8pm.  Can you take it earlier?"
Chest pain/tightness in the evening,"Heeey this is me too! I started increasing the dosis little bj little and I started 54mg last Monday. I took it at around 9 or 10am and at 6-7pm I felt my heart rate going faster with shortness of breath, I thought to myself. Okay I'll have heart attack.
Next day luckily I had an appointment with my psychiatrist and told him about this event, he said it would normally go away in the first week but if my heart kept going faster by the end of the day I should tell him to see if we needed to change it.
I don't take concerta every day maybe 3 or 4 days out of the week, so hopefully that sensation goes away quickly.
And if I feel like is too much, maybe I'll stop taking it.
(the doctor also said to not mix with it caffeine, since it's a stimulant and it could you feel worse)"
Chest pain/tightness in the evening,"What the hell, I opened Reddit to look for a post about this because I got the same side effects yesterday and yours is the first post I see. I am afraid I don’t have an answer yet but I am on the same dose (36 mg, up from 18 mg that weren’t doing much) for a while and yesterday was the first day I experienced chest tightness, along with some headache and slight nausea. Hopefully it won’t persist cause these pills have been so helpful."
Chest pain/tightness in the evening,"You should definitely chat with your doctor regardless. In my case, I had some chess tightness that came down to me just be anxious about trying new medication that I knew affected my heart rate. (Bit of a hypochondriac).

I got some blood work done and an EKG to make sure all was good and the moment I got those results my chest tightness started to go away.

Just a thought in case your a bit anxious about medical things like myself. Hope this helps :)"
Chest pain/tightness in the evening,Hey I’m just wondering if you’re eating enough during the day? I get this tightness in the evening if I haven’t eaten much all day
Chest pain/tightness in the evening,Could be reflux/heartburn?
Chest pain/tightness in the evening,"Are you monitoring your heart rate and blood pressure during this time? This sounds similar to how I crash, but mine happens a lot earlier. 

If I take Concerta 36mg around 9am I start feeling that way around 3/4pm if I haven't taken my booster, generally what's happening is that the medication is wearing off and your body is rebounding, for me this increases my blood pressure, heart rate and I end up getting anxious for a few hours, I take 20mg Propanolol to help with that and its been working great for me, I'm still not sure if I want to stay on Concerta, I have a doctors appointment soon to get results from my cardiologist to see if I should continue the med or not because without Propanolol my heart rate can stay 110bpm+ for hours on end 

I still can't figure out what induces it or what affects it, sometimes it happens after I eat because my body has to work harder, which as a result makes my heart beat faster which induces anxiety - then again this is just my theory

It's a shame because this med is great for me but its starting to become too inconsistent with the side effects."
Chest pain/tightness in the evening,"I have the exact same thing. I tried going down in Mg’s, I tried changing time of intake of medication, it was still the same.

I had an EKG, and echocardiogram, everything’s good. Conclusion: Anxiety. 

I started a breathing technique and I swear it works for me. I calm my heartrate and meditate for a while. 

Even when I’m in the car, I focus on my breath and relax, all of a sudden the chest tightness is gone. 

It really sucks and it’s scary, but if your heart screenings are okay, it might be that. *not a doctor*"
Chest pain/tightness in the evening,What would that change? I have tried taking it at 8-9-10am still same side effect
Chest pain/tightness in the evening,"Hope it goes away for you, maybe I will try to stick it out for a week as well, as normally I just freak out and stop taking them a couple days of chest pains in."
Chest pain/tightness in the evening,Hope it goes away for you!
Chest pain/tightness in the evening,"I did! Multiple times at this point hahaha EKG was perfect, I am definitely hyper aware of it at this point, so could be that too, will see if it goes away in a week."
Chest pain/tightness in the evening,"Yep, I don’t skip my meals"
Chest pain/tightness in the evening,Definitely does not feel like it..
Chest pain/tightness in the evening,"Hmmm, I am monitoring my heart rate and blood pressure, all seems to be normal and within the expected ranges, however I hope you find a solution for yourself if it continues to stay like this"
Chest pain/tightness in the evening,"Oh and L-theanine helps me too.

Seek professional advice, good luck friend!"
Chest pain/tightness in the evening,"Might be, I am definitely a quite anxious person overall, however since I switched to Elvanse, the chest tightness seemed to go away, might be just a combination of concerta not being right for me and trigerringmg anxiety and elvanse just fitting my body better, but I’m glad it went away for you as it is definitely scary!"
Chest pain/tightness in the evening,You still get the chest pain at 7-8pm?
Chest pain/tightness in the evening,"Just typed out the longest response and accidentally swiped away BUT, experienced this when I first started Concerta almost a decade ago. My doctors recommended the following: upping your water intake 2-3x normal (or the recommended amount, if you don’t drink that daily) for the first two weeks, and then be sure to actively monitor your hydration moving forward. And be sure to force yourself to eat a sufficient amount, which can be tough when you’re starting so small amounts throughout the day are good too. This worked for me to get adjusted to the medication.

When the chest pains start, try taking an NSAID + GasX or Pepto with 16oz of water. I still have occasional episodes of this (once a year or so), and in working with my med team found this combo to be effective. 

Best of luck to both of you!"
Chest pain/tightness in the evening,yep
Chest pain/tightness in the evening,Thank you!
Chest pain/tightness in the evening,"Then it can't primarily be the Concerta.  If it were, the chest pain time of day would move, too.

What are you doing earlier in the day, regularly?  Are you having afternoon caffeine?  The conversion to norepinephrine about 5 hours later may very well give you anxiety and chest pain."
Chest pain/tightness in the evening,"It is not, I have the same symptoms on Vyvanse. I do not drink coffee at all, only water and an ocassional mint tea. 

I work a desk job, so just sit most of the first side of the day."
Chest pain/tightness in the evening,"My best guess is something that consistently happens in the early evening or late afternoon causes you significant anxiety, and you didn't really notice until you were taking a stimulant."
Chest pain/tightness in the evening,"Beats me, I do different things in the evenings, sometimes workout, sometimes play video games, sometimes go out with friends, but it always happens no matter the occasion."
Emotional flattening,"I think I feel very similar and thought a lot about it the last few month.
I don‘t want to lose all the things I achieved since I‘m medicated but sometimes I miss beeing happy or even sad. I‘ll talk to my psychiatrist about this. Maybe I‘ll try to take my medication just on a few days a week instead of everyday. I can‘t imagine to stopping completely, I feel like my life would fall apart 😅 I don‘t have something helpful to say to you, just know that I feel similar and know your struggle."
Emotional flattening,"I'm dealing with the flat... new to concerta after coming off vyvance.  I hate the flat feeling.  I'm only on 27's but I don't get enough positive yet to feel like the flat feeling is worth it.  I'm in name brand concerta.  It seems the worst for me when I need to be at my best during the day.  I'm almost ready to give up on this medication journey

"Just started Concerta, bad side effects ? Need advice !","Honestly if you’re having all of those side effects on 18mg, concerta is probably not for you. Concerta was my first and my doc started me on 27 bc 18 really won’t even do much, I didn’t get any side effects until I bumped to 54.

Ask about others! Vyvanse is supposed to be better for anxiety I think, or the non stim ones like Wellbutrin or strattera might be better :) good luck, once you find the right med it’s a game changer"
"Just started Concerta, bad side effects ? Need advice !","the first week, I was tired and what not and everything went away except the dry mouth.  I have bought some special toothpaste to help keep my mouth from getting too dry."
"Just started Concerta, bad side effects ? Need advice !","I didn’t eat or sleep much for the first 3 months then I started taking it as needed a few times a week and gradually added days, now I take it up
To 5 days (because I forget a few and don’t take it after 10 am) I was diagnosed with major depression and panic disorder for like 20 years on and off different depression meds and sleeping pills.

Every one is different and everyone hates hearing it but look at your diet,  exercise, meditation or relaxation techniques. Oh I also like to get a tan when I’m not feeling ok, not for the tan but for the sunny feeling. 

They say concerta doesn’t react with some meds like prednisone 👀😓 I get major anxiety and rapid heart rate, sweats if I have to do around of prednisone so I don’t take concerts for that week. Consider other meds or supplements may be reactive despite the pharmacist telling you it’s fine."
"Just started Concerta, bad side effects ? Need advice !","for me my side affects weren’t terrible when i started it. i’ve taken a lot of medications in the past 8 years so i guess im not really phased by them anymore? i did notice i had worse anxiety. I stuck with it and am now up to 54 mg. raising the dose seemed to help a lot and as time went on i noticed side effects went away. i do forget to eat often though…make sure to eat before you take it. protein shakes also help a lot. my only side effects i’ve had is getting “nauseous”. this drug has never caused me to throw up but for some reason i have these dry heaving spells, always in the morning. it doesn’t bother me since i’ve never actually thrown up lol. zofran can help if you’re actually nauseous though. i’ve been taking concerta for about 7 months so feel free to ask any questions."
"Just started Concerta, bad side effects ? Need advice !","this is exactly how Elvanse made me feel, I also have anxiety issues but it got more manageable while it was active, but even after weeks and a dosage change the ""crash"" persisted, it might just not be the best for you (I took Concerta for the first time today exactly because of that, Elvanse wasn't for me)

edit: Elvanse is the european name for Vyvanse"

"Just started Concerta, bad side effects ? Need advice !","Did you experience dilated pupils while on Concerta? Is it generic or brand? Could you say how many hours after taking Concerta you experienced the dilated pupils, and did you ever experience that before?"
"Just started Concerta, bad side effects ? Need advice !","I’ll just tell you my experience and you can make of it whatever you will! I started on 18 mg about 3 weeks ago and the first week was exactly as you describe… positive effects and negative ones too, about 50/50. 

I wasn’t sure I’d continue with it. Then I took a week off and started again with 27mg. The difference was incredible. Whether it was due to me being accustomed to the meds a bit now or because of the higher dose i don’t know but I had an incredibly more positive experience. All the positives with hardly any bad effects. I can go into more details if you like but I just wanted to say that there is hope for you. Things can get better, and don’t give up. 

Just ask away if you have any questions I might be able to help with!"
"Just started Concerta, bad side effects ? Need advice !","Thank you! I’ll definitely talk to my doctor about this for sure and see what she thinks :) I want to go back to college next fall so I’m really trying to find something that works for me fully, as I had to drop out last year due to my struggles with my symptoms. I REALLY love the course and want to find the right med that will help me work through it better."
"Just started Concerta, bad side effects ? Need advice !","I totally agree with this statement. They typically start adults at 27 mg, which is what happened to me. But 36 mg ended up being perfect. When there was a shortage, I took Vyvanse and it was wonderful for my anxiety.  But it did nothing for my ADHD and we increased the dosage three times.  Definitely speak with your doctor. A non-stimulant medication may work better for you."
"Just started Concerta, bad side effects ? Need advice !",Yes but I will say first 4 days of 18mg I had tons of side effects but they’ve gone away now. Sometimes your body just needs a minute to get used to it
"Just started Concerta, bad side effects ? Need advice !","My doctor did warn me that concerta could react with my anxiety, at least for a little while. I struggle with physical anxiety and panic attacks that come on for seemingly no reason. mentally i’ll be telling myself im fine and it wasn’t triggered by any mental reason, but I get this panic and intense paranoia that is so, so awful. I’ve been better with the panic the past few days, but the anxiety is almost constant. However, doc did warn me about that, AND many people have told me thats normal for a side effect the first week or two. I’m just gonna keep going for a week or two and see how I feel after that, as well as check up with my doctor !

I definitely do agree with you that diet, exercise, medication, and relaxation techniques are important ! Relaxation techniques don’t always help during a panic attack and I often have to ride it out, but it can help a lot with general anxiety. Diet I know is something I need to keep on top of, as everywhere I’ve seen also states that the meds can’t work as they should be without proper eating, and I have NOT been eating properly since I started taking these meds because of the lack of appetite, but I’m gonna be working on that for sure.

If concerta doesn’t end up working well for me after a while than I will consider other options if my doctor agrees too!"
"Just started Concerta, bad side effects ? Need advice !","The first day I took it I had plenty of side effects as mentioned, but now on day 4 I have less. My main ones are the anxiety (which heightens paranoia for me too), the fuzzy weird full body feeling, and I’ve also now noticed being more confused or feeling unable to think clearly. This wasn’t there on day 1 and 2 like this. The brain fog is newer but definitely isn’t helping. I do still notice a small increase in motivation but it’s so hard to tell how its working right now because I’m still kinda feeling a little wired. I’ve taken lots of meds through my life too but never any stimulates or anything like this so its definitely new to me! The nausea was only that first day during the crash, I haven’t gotten it since thankfully. I also get nauseous more often because of IBS so I always have gravol with me lol. However the first day the crash was bad but hasn’t been as bad since. I do notice in the mornings I’m still more anxious before I take my pill, and also very out of it, fatigued, and just overall not feeling great. I’m basically kind of all over the place right now 😅 Its SO hard to tell how well its working or whats happening with the intense brain fog that showed up. However, I’m still giving it a week or two to see if anything gets better and changes as I know adjusting to this med takes time."
"Just started Concerta, bad side effects ? Need advice !","hi! i’m on 50mg elvanse (for 1.5yrs) and i’m now wondering if i’ve just tolerated the side effects instead of thinking of the obvious - try concerta. if u don’t mind, can you tell me ur experience changing meds?"
"Just started Concerta, bad side effects ? Need advice !","I have, on brand med. But it looks like not a problem"
"Just started Concerta, bad side effects ? Need advice !","Ouhh thats interesting !
honestly the idea of upping the dose scares the shit outta me with the effects i’ve been having, but i have heard multiple people say it helps. id love to hear more about your positive experiences after upping it if you dont mind ? i want to bring up everything to my doctor, and see what she thinks, and it helps to hear others experiences. im definitely gonna keep trying this medication for a few weeks and see how things go, as the 3rd day isnt great to judge on hahah. i just would like the anxiety to go away 😭🙏"
"Just started Concerta, bad side effects ? Need advice !","i FEEL you. I took 2 semesters off bc my shit was out of control, I was literally failing multiple classes for constant dumb stuff like doing an assignment and moving on to the next thing so fast I’d forget to submit it. adhd is fr such a struggle. Finally starting classes again this spring now that I found the loml (vyvanse). stoked for you, you def made the right move reaching out for some help"
"Just started Concerta, bad side effects ? Need advice !","It might turn out that Concerta isn't the drug for you since side effects on 18mg isn't a good sign, but listen to your doctor (and talk to them) and stick it out for a week or two.  The anxiety often goes away.

The appetite suppressant is more than likely going to stay, though."
"Just started Concerta, bad side effects ? Need advice !","I hate that feeling of anxiety lingering around when there is no reason for it. My cousin will like, stand up and kind of bend in half to flip her head upside down and come back up, she says it helps I’m not sure. Sometimes I ignore it, sometimes I try different things. 😅 cold shower, hot bath, change clothes, wash face, move to a different room, go outside, Eat carbs or comfort food (not my best attempted solution), Chew gum, or Lay down and decompress. Sometimes it’s sensory like my pants are too tight, I’m uncomfortable, or my skins itchy but I’m busy so I don’t directly notice.  

As for healthy eating no one is perfect we do the best we can. I know I feel the best when I go to the gym 4 times a week to avoid processed food, wheat flour and dairy. I love all that, that’s not fair 😓. And I haven’t been going to the gym nearly that much. But I started listening to this advice a few people gave me: 
Don’t be so hard on yourself.

When a task gives me anxiety that’s when concerta really helps, I can just do the thing and see that it’s not that bad and every time it gets easier because my brain sees that there was nothing to worry about. When I don’t take concerta I panic inside about tasks or conversations or what every dumb things go through my head that are big at that time but inconsequential in the long run."
"Just started Concerta, bad side effects ? Need advice !","I know what you mean with the fuzzy feeling, the way I experience it and the way my doctor explained is that this med sort of quiets your brain down a lot in order for you to focus on important things. She told me this because I was concerned why I was falling asleep a few hours into taking it. It’s because I was so calmed by the medication (and I wasn’t getting enough sleep at night) that it made me settle down to sleep. 

As far as feeling if the medication is working, it’s pretty hard to tell. I don’t take it every single day, only on days I work or have a lot to get done. You will notice a difference in your productivity. If I take my concerta and I’m just staying home, I will start deep cleaning things. When I first started taking it the efficacy seemed to wear off after a week or two on a smaller dose. It got better when I increased my dose. 

Another important part about this medication is the timing. I’m sure you know this but if you take it too late you will be up all night, too early and it won’t last throughout your day. You just need to find your sweetspot time and this should makw the “crash” more manageable."
"Just started Concerta, bad side effects ? Need advice !","heyyy :) I was on 60mg Elvanse but I actually completely stopped taking it since around May(?) due to how bad the crash was (was starting to get depressive thoughts), I don't know if that will affect tolerance or not, Elvanse only lasted 5 hours tops for me, I'm hoping Concerta will last longer

I only got my official diagnosis last Monday (finally 😭) and that's why I'm starting Concerta now, yesterday I messed up cause I got the generic version 💀 so today is my actual first day of taking it

I definetely think the dose is too low for me (18mg) because it's barely doing anything but I can tell that the side-effects will probably be less harsh than with Elvanse, even when I up my dose, because I'm only feeling bad anxiety (I already have anxiety issues so I think any meds will make it bad), not as bad as with Elvanse, and some really mild nausea and headache, which is definitely being worsened by the fact that my eating and hydration habits have been absolutely abysmal and I haven't worked out in months

you can dm me if you want, I'll make sure to keep you updated!"
"Just started Concerta, bad side effects ? Need advice !","Yeah for sure, I have a tendency towards anxiety for sure but not enough for an actual diagnosis so our circumstances are different. I started on 18 mg for a week and at the end of it I was undecided whether I should continue on meds or not at all. The positives and negatives were about even at that stage. On the plus side, I was productive and felt positive for half a day but on the other hand I had trouble sleeping , was emotionally flat, felt like a zombie when I took a break and felt like I was veering towards anxiety once of twice.
Then I took a break for a week and went back to 27mg and had much better results. Who knows why? Maybe because I took a week off, or because the dose suited me better or my brain had become used to it? Anyway it was a more or less a totally good week, no real side effects except maybe a bit more difficulty falling asleep. 
I did not think I was going to be one of those people who had such success but here I am. Touch wood. Hope it continues like this. 
I’m sure you are well aware of all these things but do make sure you are fully fueled up in terms of food, even if you don’t feel hungry, drink plenty of water and make sure you are sleeping enough. I really believe these things can influence the effect of the meds on you enormously but I’m sure you have heard all that before. 
I hope it works out for you! Good luck!"
"Just started Concerta, bad side effects ? Need advice !","Thank you !!!
Yeah it was awful, I struggled SO BAD with executive dysfunction, and I had a reduced course-load and accommodations, except I didn’t know I had ADHD, so I didn’t have all the accommodations I needed. Even with the reduced course load I was struggling to start and complete assignments and it would pile up so quickly and I would be smothered. Its a course I LOVE too but that didn’t make a difference for my lack of motivation and such. I also have seizures and tics that are brought on my stress and fatigue so those got SO bad and my health just plummeted. Once I got my ADHD diagnosis and the recommendations my psychologist gave me I was like holy shit. So much of that struggle was ADHD and I had NO IDEA for my whole life 😭 But now I can finally try medication for it, and Concerta may not be working properly right now with the side effects but even the positive effects it gave me shows me how much potential meds have. Definitely gonna look into other meds but I’m relieved to have this option now!"
"Just started Concerta, bad side effects ? Need advice !","Will do ! I’m keeping a list of my symptoms and experiences so I can speak to my doctor about everything. I’ll see how it goes, and if not good, try something new. I’ve experienced less side effects so far now. Today wasn’t bad except for the anxiety and fuzzy feeling. All the other side effects seem to have subsided, so hopefully the anxiety does eventually to. if not im def trying something else because its hard to deal with for sure 😭"
"Just started Concerta, bad side effects ? Need advice !","Thank you !
Hearing others experiences and such really helps me with the anxiety part of it and helps me feel less alone, so I appreciate it a lot. ❤️

Yeah I have heard about staying hydrated and eating well, I unfortunately haven’t been eating well with the loss of appetite and it’s probably having an effect on the meds for sure.

I’m on day 4 now, and honestly the only main side effects now that I am noticing is a strong full body fuzzy feeling, and anxiety/nervousness, and for some reason, brain dog and lack of concentration. I have noticed the positive effects seem harder to tell if they are working anymore, as I’m more foggy and honestly really having trouble thinking entirely. Other than that, everything else is fine, but I honestly don’t think this med is working for me at this dose or this med at all. Although, I’m only day 4, so its hard to tell, and things may level out. 

I see my doctor again this Thursday, so I’ll see what she thinks! For now I’m gonna keep taking them and try and focus on eating/drinking enough and monitoring my symptoms."
"Just started Concerta, bad side effects ? Need advice !","Just on what you were saying about concentration and brain fog etc.I found (especially during the first week) that it helped with concentration but only for one thing at a time. So I found it best to try to get on with things/projects/assignments/whatever that I had decided to do in advance.  Everything else went out the window but I was able to really make progress with those single things.  I even got quite forgetful which I’m not usually. I guess my brain was just focusing on the ONE important thing. This has gotten better in the following weeks and I am not so one track now. 

Just to reiterate… food, rest, water are essential. Even if you just have a bite of something every two hours? 

Best of luck going forward!"

New to stimulants ,melatonin might help. also side effects like insomnia and feeling way too energized should go away after a week or two. if they don't then this perhaps isn't the right med for you.
New to stimulants ,"Do you have the original concerta or is it just marked on the tube “Methylphenidate extended release”? In this case it may be the credits like what I had because the original concerta is out of stock.. the duration of the effects can vary, the credits generally last 8 hours compared to 12 hours for the real one"
New to stimulants ,I had similar issues and started taking magnesium glycinte and helped a lot. I take it a hour before before bed.
New to stimulants ,"This is a really common thing when you're new to concerta, it will fade! don't worry, I can't speak for everyone becuase I had a pretty bad time with it but for me it lasted about 3/4 months, but for most it's like a month at most"
New to stimulants ,I had issues on generic methylphenidate ER. They no longer make a proper generic of Concerta so I had to ask my doc to prescribe concerta brand specifically. For me it works so much better. It is a huge pain to deal with the insurance but it works significantly better for me.
New to stimulants ,"Thank you for your help! I will keep trying. I am checking in with her in two weeks, so I will let her know how I’m doing then! 
I appreciate your insight!"
New to stimulants ,"It is labeled as methylphenidate ER! What do you mean by ""credits""? Are you saying that this is the duration of the medication's effects?"
New to stimulants ,"I just ordered magnesium l-threonate last night!! 
Thank you for sharing your experience. I know it’s a common side effect, I just want to sleep lol."
New to stimulants ,"Thank you for sharing your experience! I’m sorry that it took so long for things to even out for you. If you’re still on it, has it been better for you after the 3/4 months?"
New to stimulants ,"Good to know! I’ll touch base with her and see what she says! 
Thank you for sharing your experience!"
New to stimulants ,"In this case, you must tell the doctor the next time you see him to mark on the prescription ""Non-substitutable"" after the methylphenidate ER means ""Extended Release"" which means that it is methylphenidate with extended release like concerta, but I noticed that the generic lasts a little less long than the ""real"" concerta which uses a 3-phase release system called OROS, but afterwards if you feel good with the generic it's already great, just for the next times if you wish to have the real Concerta, tell your doctor to note: Not Substitutable at the end of the prescription"
New to stimulants ,"Yes! It did, I spoke with my doctor while I was having a hard time and we worked together to manage it while it was still an issue for me, becuase every other aspect of concerta was working so well for me, but after those few months I was able to sleep pretty well without any help!"
New to stimulants ,But isn’t brand name Concerta a lot more expensive? OP should know that if requesting no generics.
New to stimulants ,That’s good to note! I’ll look into it. Thank you for bringing that to my attention!
"Concerta has eliminated my fatigue, but I still can't concentrate at all","I think you should consider going up a dose on concerta to at least see if it benefits your ability to focus. 

Allowing yourself breaks to be distracted might help as well. You could try something like Pomodoro method."
"Concerta has eliminated my fatigue, but I still can't concentrate at all",Exercise before needing to concentrate and a dosage increase. I was on 36mg within weeks of starting and it worked beautifully for about 9 to 10 months without any days off before I needed an increase. And that doesn't happen to everyone anyway. But a lot of experts believe you should be on the highest dosage that doesn't cause unbearable side effects.
"Concerta has eliminated my fatigue, but I still can't concentrate at all","I would suggest mentioning it to your doctor first and foremost. 

However, I noticed in your post you never mentioned quality and quantity of sleep. Like anything, it cannot replace impactful rest. For example caffeine can keep you awake but doesn’t necessarily mean concentration"

"Concerta has eliminated my fatigue, but I still can't concentrate at all","Thank you very much.

I was somewhat hesitant to increase the dosage because I was concerned about developing a tolerance and the side effects on drug-free days. However, since I am currently far from being able to concentrate, I will discuss a prescription of 36 mg.

I am also considering trying the Pomodoro Technique again. Recently, since I have been working remotely and haven't been leaving the house, I am thinking of taking some time to refresh myself."
"Concerta has eliminated my fatigue, but I still can't concentrate at all","Thank you very much. As you pointed out, I have insomnia. I only manage to get about 4 to 6 hours of sleep. Last night, I was overwhelmed with work and only slept for around 3 hours, so after work I took a 3-hour nap. My sleep schedule has become irregular like this. I want to improve it, but I can’t fall asleep.

Additionally, my partner sometimes suggests that I might have sleep apnea."
"Concerta has eliminated my fatigue, but I still can't concentrate at all","I am not an expert as I have not solved this same problem yet myself. I am similar to you in that I have intense constant fatigue and sleepiness. 

I have also not been leaving the house much lately. I've been sick recently so have not been able to try this idea yet, but I have an idea to try to shake up my routine with at least 1 thing every day. Ideally, that 1 thing should involve going outside, if it's not terrible weather, for example a walk outside. Or at the very least a short walk to a cafe. Or some days perhaps it will be going to yoga or an exercise class outside of the house. I want to maybe sometimes bring my work or hobby stuff to a library or cafe. I really prefer the comfort of home, but I think I need to do something to try to basically help the concerta work. More physical activity, more changes in routine.

Historically I have tried Pomodoro before I was medicated and I hated it. But maybe it could work with longer intervals. I haven't tried it while being on concerta yet."
"Concerta has eliminated my fatigue, but I still can't concentrate at all","I’ve always had issues with the pomodoro method because the 5 minute breaks would always end up being longer, but I recently found a game (paca Pomo) that’s free and basically it processes every time you have a focus session. So I just play the game for the 5 minute break, and it has a timer, so then it’s way easier to get back to what I was doing. I’ve only used it a few times, but I think things of that nature can really help and I’m sure there are many similar tools out there :)"
10 27mg concertas over the past 24hrs ,Stop popping stims like candy and go to bed.
10 27mg concertas over the past 24hrs ,"Your body needs sleep, and your overuse of the concerta is dangerous. Listen to your body and sleep."
10 27mg concertas over the past 24hrs ,"I know how it is. I am assuming you are chasing the initial rush/kick. Redosing won't help.

Chasing that will lead you to very dangerous and depressing places, telling that from experience.

Keeping redosing will simply prevent you from sleeping or eating, which will make you want to take even more. The more you pop the worse it will be once you stop.

It can make you feel like you are going insane. Talk to your doc if that dose is not working. Think about why you redosed, was it because you felt it stopped working or were you chasing a feeling?

I am not judging at all, it's not hard to be dragged when all your life you couldn't focus, but this will bring you no good.

Try to drink water, eat, take a relaxing shower and do relaxing shit. It might suck for a few hours, or maybe not, but stop taking more. 

Talk to your doc about your experience, concerta might not be it for you. But above all, never chase a high."

10 27mg concertas over the past 24hrs ,That would hurt my stomach
Anyone Switch from Concerta to Ritalin,Concerta only releases 22% of the payload in the first couple hours.  You'd need to take 54mg of it to get the same initial effect as your 10mg Ritalin.
Anyone Switch from Concerta to Ritalin,"Yes. I switched from 72mg concerta to 60mg Ritalin. Feeling much better IF I don't forget to take/time the doses correctly, every 4 hours. At about 3/4 hours I start to get tired, clumsy, ready for a nap.


At first I had alarms every 4 hours (10-20-20-10). Which made it incredibly annoying after a month. Had to stop using so many alarms.


Overall I feel much better, less anxiety, sleep better. 


The problem now is, as you can guess, I forget. And sometimes go 5-6 hours before I tell myself why am so crashy for a few times before I reach the conclusion that I forgot to take the next dosage 😑"

Anyone Switch from Concerta to Ritalin,I have two issues with Concerta. Keeps me up late. Benefits take about the same two hours. So I started waking up at 5:30AM to take the pill then head to the gym. By the time I’m done and settling into work at 8:00AM it’s kicked in and I’m super productive. The extra energy helps me have a longer more productive day. Starting early and working out helps me sleep. I’ve done this for about a week now and it’s good so far.

Anyone Switch from Concerta to Ritalin,"I found this funny, around 10mg in the first hour. And if you look the it up, it's actually around 43mg of methylphenidate and the rest are excipients. But 54 looks so high of a dosage? But if you modulate throughout the day with 4 IR Ritalin is basically the same and doesn't seem ""high dosage""?"
Anyone Switch from Concerta to Ritalin,"I feel this, with Concerta, I find that the Osmotic release system doesn't sit well with my nervous system, I don't find it consistent enough - When it works, its great. 

I took my Concerta (27mg) at 9am, took until 11am for it to kick-in but I couldn't do anything productive, I just watched the football match lol, I end up taking a nap because I feel fatigued (probably cause I didn't take my booster) 

After hours of procrastinating, I take my 10mg Ritalin and manage to run the dishwasher, put away laundry, order groceries and clean up my place a bit as I had company over in the evening

10mg felt very smooth and I could tell when it was wearing off as I started going back to ""multi-task"" but no anxiety or crash

I got up a bit earlier today but I'm gonna try doing 10mg Ritalin x3 today to see how it goes!"
Anyone Switch from Concerta to Ritalin,How long does your Concerta usually last? Do you find the effect to be consistent across the entire duration?
Anyone Switch from Concerta to Ritalin,"Sorry didn't understand that lol, I think it has something to do with the way my body metabolizes the release system in Concerta, I'm thinking about trying generic and seeing how that goes"
Anyone Switch from Concerta to Ritalin,"Maybe 5-6 hours. For me it is consistent as long as my other habits (sleep, protein, electrolytes, etc.) are"
Anyone Switch from Concerta to Ritalin,"Same here, 5-6 hours seems to be the point where if I hadn't taken my booster 3 hours after my initial Concerta dose, I will end up crashing"
Anyone Switch from Concerta to Ritalin,"It's pretty common, anecdotally it doesn't last as long for people as it does on paper & it's common to add a booster.

I saw a dr for a different issue the other day, he asked what medication I was on & he was like ""both???"" & I was like ""???? yes???"". I've never heard of it lasting 14 hours for someone irl"
Anyone Switch from Concerta to Ritalin,"Yup, I find its really hit and miss finding a doctor that understands ADHD and how these medications work, so many doctors try to treat the condition rather than the individual, and ADHD as a condition affects every single differently"
Anyone Switch from Concerta to Ritalin,"Agreed, I had to do what you're doing here, learn, hold my doctor's hand through it; it's constant advocating for yourself (as I imagine most medical stuff is)."

Concerta 36mg,Appreciate who can help me
Loss of social inhibitions?,"Yes. My wife says I have verbal diarrhoea sometimes. I am more confidant expressing myself and sharing my opinions . And the anxiety symptom of rethinking everything I might have said is almost gone. Mostly I believe it is a positive effect , but sometimes I can border maybe on arrogant or being to forceful. And after 2 beers multiply the above time two. 😂"
Loss of social inhibitions?,"It broke my social anxiety for sure. But with time I was able to get a grip on the verbal diarrhea I was outputting.

Now I’m using this superpower to have nice conversations with my clients. Even my employee noticed how I’m more outgoing with our clients and it’s generating us more money lol

I just pay attention to not go overboard with it."
Loss of social inhibitions?,"It can indeed happen. So, Concerta as a reuptake inhibitor makes dopamine and noradrenaline stay around longer. This makes tasks feel more ""rewarding"" to your brain, even if you don't feel it. It's why it feels so easy to just get up and do something. In theory, Concerta is not making you do something you wouldn't, but reducing the threshold for you to do something you want. No, you won't become a cheater or a sociopath. It just may make you more like that or often more social in a good way. It's weird, but it does happen and makes total sense,"
Loss of social inhibitions?,"Concerta most likely helped you with your social anxieties.  There's no way to say this next part nicely, so I'll just say it...

If your anxieties were the only thing keeping you from being a major asshole, you're going to need to learn how to not be a major asshole."
Loss of social inhibitions?,Yes… I actually stopped taking it because of this. I stopped trusting myself to speak in meetings and that’s a problem lol

Loss of social inhibitions?,do you get anxiety after the alcohol wears of in combo with methylphenidate(concerta)?
Loss of social inhibitions?,"No, side effects. Perhaps bodies adapt to the combo? Living in a wine producing region a glass or two of wine late afternoon/early evening is common. I was not even aware in the beginning that the two should not mix. Perhaps it affected me initially but not anymore. My wife would also quickly comment on it if she noticed my behaviour was unusual or I was getting to tipsy."

Concerta seems to be working (I believe) yet I still get bored while studying ,"Boredom means you're not interested in what you're studying. If you can study despite that disinerest, then the Concerta is probably helping.

Concerta seems to be working (I believe) yet I still get bored while studying ,"Why? Because even though you're taking Concerta, you're still human. You aren't taking breaks, are you?  
It's very common with medicated ADHD to have the urge to be as productive as possible, but you need to take breaks too. Try the pomodoro method."
Concerta seems to be working (I believe) yet I still get bored while studying ,I used to take Ritalin and I was studying like crazy. I’m just confused why I can’t get work done while being on Concerta even though I genuinely want to study.
Concerta seems to be working (I believe) yet I still get bored while studying ,"Ah, okay, then it sounds like the Concerta isn't working the way Ritalin did for you. Might be that it's not the right dosage? Definitely talk to your psychiatrist if you can."
Concerta seems to be working (I believe) yet I still get bored while studying ,Hi I think we probably have similar situation. Concerta 54mg makes me over concentrate on a single task and can’t make me switch to do something else. I’m now trying 36mg and Ritalin IR 5-10 mg as a supplement. I feel it does better than 54mg.
Concerta seems to be working (I believe) yet I still get bored while studying ,How much Ritalin were you taking and how often?
Concerta seems to be working (I believe) yet I still get bored while studying ,It could also be burnout.
Concerta seems to be working (I believe) yet I still get bored while studying ,10mg 2 times a day or sometimes 3. Depended on how much time I could spare to study.
Hyper-focus on 54mg,30-40mg IR is approximately 36mg concerta. Me personally I haven't tried 54mg but 36 mg 10 mg IR in the evening works pretty fine for me. You could try 36mg first and if its not enough try the combination I suggested.

Hyper-focus on 54mg,Yeah. I still have a little bit 36mg left and I just tried it today. It work well if I take it in the morning and also take 5mg Ritalin IR once to twice. I think Ritalin IR helps me well on creativity and switching tasks.
18mg Concerta and 10mg of Cipralex?,"I'm on the same dose as you! I've been on cipralex for 15+ years and I take it at night. I haven't noticed any increased anxiety on concerta (it's only been 5 days tho). 

My psychiatrist said they work well together. Being on cipralex preemptively treats the anxiety you might feel on concerta. He said if I notice an increase in anxiety, then we'd increase the cipralex. 

Hope that helps! 

Honestly, I've had way less adhd anxiety since starting concerta. My mind is clear, and I feel a lot calmer. Things that would normally make me irritable or anxious don't. I just ...deal with it? Lol. Super duper weird and absolutely amazing."

Extremely horny,Absolutely not vyvanse is what works wonders regarding that topic
Extremely horny,Of course it will pass with time
Extremely horny,"Even with Ritalin the 1st time, lol
It'll stop eventually, just enjoy it ;)"
Extremely horny,It does go away
Extremely horny,Me. Not extreme but very much horny.
Extremely horny,"Yup. F/43, always had a pretty high sex drive, but on concerta it's becoming a bit of a problem. First I thought it was just because orgasming felt so much better on concerta, like such a damn high, so just addictive behaviour. But now I'm realising it's also just that if I think about something sexy my mind has so much more powerful tools for it and I get annoyingly horny no matter where I am.

It's actually affecting my productivity because I'm too damn motivated to please myself lol. My dose is otherwise perfect and I'm getting a lot of benefits and virtually no side effects, but this is actually troublesome. What a freaking problem to have at this age."
Extremely horny,Why not 😫 how do I stop
Extremely horny,Why not? There's nothing wrong with it
Extremely horny,Does it go away? I’m not complaining just wondering if normal lol
Extremely horny,Yes 27 MG
Extremely horny,It's the exact opposite for me
Extremely horny,not if you add some caffeine to it
Extremely horny,Like concerta makes me horny and a little drowsy and gives me the best quality of sleep I ever had. I think my body is fundamentally weird.
Extremely horny,That's terrible advice.  Sometimes you need to work one out and get on with your day.  I was on vyvance and it was the opposite.  So I appreciate it.
Extremely horny,Yeah yeah it went away after a couple of weeks
Extremely horny,"Welcome to the club, don't worry this effect will go and you will start to see focus effects from it soon."
Extremely horny,"Ugh no! I really hope this doesn't happen, especially if I don't take it all the time"
Extremely horny,"Any idea how long it lasts? I've been on my current dose for a couple of months and still horny like a teenager, it's ridiculous."
Extremely horny,It depends on the dose and on your body but it won't take longer than that period
Concerta no longer works? Would the effects come back?,"I have read on Reddit that sometimes taking a short med break (1-2 days) helps with this and it may work better again after. 

Additionally, unless you're in a country that only allows up to 36 mg for some reason, you still have room to go up to 54 or 72 mg."
Concerta no longer works? Would the effects come back?,I thought the same at one point after moving from 18 to 36mg. Then I was put on 54mg which worked great. Strangely - after about a month on 54mg I had to go back down to 36mg as it was then too much for me.
Concerta no longer works? Would the effects come back?,I am not sure what your diet currently looks like but protein intake makes a huge difference. Especially breakfast. I believe water also helped the time release mechanism if you are on name brand. I upped my protein intake to at least 100 g/ day and now I’m considering lowering my dose even though I’ve been on 54mg for well over a year

Old AF and on Day One of stimulants ever,"I am older as well, diagnosed at 57. Tried wellbutrin then Strattera, both did nothing so I stopped all medication for a couple more years, went on 18mg of Methylphenidate last year, moved to 27 a week later then 36 after a couple more weeks and here I sit in a better place so far. I didn't have many side effects and found that my focus improved, my head calmed down, and my anxiety reduced. I have controlled hypertension and that hasn't been an issue, so it helps me. Initially, I put it off because its a stimulant but so far, I find it helpful.  Recently  started taking a 5mg instant release kicker a couple nights per week when I teach night classes to deal with the crash. Good luck to you. I felt the same way when I started."
Old AF and on Day One of stimulants ever,Hello there! Never too late. Good luck on your new journey!

Work with your physician to find the right dose and give it some time to settle in. I found medication was helpful but not the silver bullet to the aspects of my adhd. But super helpful in some aspects of emotional regulation that I didn’t realize was as issue for me until I was medicated. But this isn’t about me, it’s about you. You got this OP!

I think they are going to have to bump me up to 36 before long and maybe a IR booster in the afternoon.  I’m having trouble with focus and motivation at this point.  So hoping it gets better soon.  This is my 2nd month of Concerta btw.  Good Luck OP!
Old AF and on Day One of stimulants ever,"you aren't old af... I'm a couple years older than you, recently diagnosed after having the symptoms all my life.  I started three months ago on 18mg, now I'm in my second month of 27mg. I prefer it without food. Maybe an hour or so before I eat, or couple hours after eating. Ideally , I'd take it in the morning after waking, then not eat until dinner.  

you'll be fine. just take it early in the day, and skip caffeine if you normally have it"

Old AF and on Day One of stimulants ever,"Hello! I was diagnosed last year around this time when I was 51. Talk about mind blown! It was weird to reframe my entire personality with the new knowledge that explained many of my quirks. All my life since old enough to remember I’ve been beating myself up internally and deliberately avoiding many situations and experiences because I never felt worthy…

Maybe you can relate? It was a really weird couple of months after starting treatment and going back through core memories and understanding them totally differently.

I started last December on 150mg slow release Wellbutrin, which isn’t supposed to be for adhd but many psychs have had good results prescribing it. I was also prescribed 5mg of Ritalin twice a day, but ended up stopping that a few months in becuse I felt the Wellbutrin was doing enough (spoiler alert: it wasn’t)

Wellbutrin isn’t a stimulant, but it sure feels like one to me. The first few weeks were amazing, and often called the ‘Wellbutrin honeymoon’. I tried increasing to 300mg and I’ve read that 450mg is often used for adhd. 300mg made me feel uncomfortable and I felt much better dropping back down to 150mg.

But then I started reading adhd groups and saw that a lot of people had great results on concerta. It’s a little expensive here in Thailand - around $3 per pill, but I decided to try it and was given 27mg to start on. That was around 3 weeks ago now, but here are my experiences - good and bad.

Bad
- Constipation and irritable bowel syndrome type symptoms. 
- Total lack of appetite. I need to force myself to eat and food is just so unappealing… this is VERY unusual for me and I’ve been obese most of my adult life. It got to the point where I was just having coffee and some cookies for breakfast and then some yoghurt with fruit around 8pm. That’s compared to my previous self, where I would plan out the entire day around food and be thinking about the next meal while I was still eating!
- Insomnia. This is a big one for me… if I don’t take it before 10am then I’m often up till 2-3am the following morning. Hopefully  this goes away with time.
- ‘scatter brained’. Some days I feel like I’ve been busy all day but got nothing done! Also making a lot of really stupid decisions and mistakes, but this is getting better as I’m more mindful of it. I will walk into a room and have zero idea why, and this happens a LOT more since starting Concerta.
- Time blindness. This is another weird/new thing for me. My internal clock is totally off.. I will be doing something that feels like a long time, but it’s only been 10 minutes - and vice versa.

Luckily I am self employed, so I can get away with being scatterbrained or using time poorly. I’m not sure how good I’d be handling this if I had a full time job.

Good
- Less appetite is a good thing for me, and I’m kind of grateful that I’m breaking old habits and rethinking my relationship with food. I’m making much better decisions around food and when I do eat it’s healthy stuff. This ties into the increased confidence and self esteem. I WANT to eat better now. 
- Much better overall mood. The constant internal chatter is still there, but it’s more often positive and I even catch myself giving praise. Again, after 4 decades with almost zero self esteem - this has been wonderful.
- increased confidence. I’m in a pretty crappy marriage and felt trapped before and resigned  to the fact that this was all I could hope for. My internal dialogue has totally changed in just a few weeks. Now I’m feeling more empowered and optimistic.
- I can watch an entire movie!!!! I could only do that in cinemas before. The same with watching tutorial videos etc. 


Overall the pros far outweigh the cons and I’ll definitely be continuing this medication. I just need to sort out the constipation and insomnia issues. Good luck to you - I had the same concerns before starting, so I hope my reply helps a little."
Old AF and on Day One of stimulants ever,So how was it?
Old AF and on Day One of stimulants ever,"Thanks so much for sharing your results, it gives me hope. I’ve spent so many years dealing with the symptoms. I just want something to work!"
Old AF and on Day One of stimulants ever,Thank you!
Old AF and on Day One of stimulants ever,Thank you for sharing!
Old AF and on Day One of stimulants ever,Same!
Old AF and on Day One of stimulants ever,Thanks. My biggest worry is it not working! I hate the dosage game. I was on 100 mg Strattera and got zero relief.
Old AF and on Day One of stimulants ever,Thank you and good luck too!
Old AF and on Day One of stimulants ever,Thanks for the nice words!
Old AF and on Day One of stimulants ever,Thank you!!
Old AF and on Day One of stimulants ever,"Man…I wish it worked that fast for me!! But I am glad it is going well for you, because that keeps me hopeful. I probably will need to have my dosage increased to feel any effects."
Old AF and on Day One of stimulants ever,Thank you so much for sharing!
Old AF and on Day One of stimulants ever,Wow!  Thanks so much for your post. I really appreciate all your experience.
Old AF and on Day One of stimulants ever,"Honestly…. I noticed zero difference. Took my second day pill this morning, and still nothing. *Sigh*"
Old AF and on Day One of stimulants ever,"The truth is it may not work. Everyone's body & mind are different, and it often takes time to find the right fit. Just keep going back to your psych and tell them exactly what's going on. Methylphenidate and Adderall are the normal first line treatments because they help the vast majority of people. So you're def on the right track. 

Keep a log of things like how it makes you feel both good & bad, how long does it last, are you having trouble sitting still, are you able to concentrate, how long, etc... you'll know what they're looking for after a few sessions. When I asked my psych how to determine when I'm treated, they said, ""You should be able to read something boring for 45 minutes"" They have a *lot more options to try if this isn't for you, and you will eventually get there. Just be patient and try not to get frustrated, you're on the way there.  

I forgot to add: nothing is going to really help if you aren't sleeping right, eating right, and staying hydrated."
Old AF and on Day One of stimulants ever,"IMO Strattera is bullshit! It did nothing at all that I noticed. But Concerta, now that’s a game changer! I have clarity of mind now. 

Me: F. 63. 
Diagnosed at 62! 
Currently 108 mg / day"
Old AF and on Day One of stimulants ever,Don't get pessimistic yet. You're only taking half the max dose.  Talk to your doctor and tell them what's going on.  The next step will most likely be to simply increase it.
Old AF and on Day One of stimulants ever,Many thanks. The “read something boring for 45 minutes” part blew my mind. I didn’t think that would ever be possible for me. What a great way to know it’s working. Highly appreciate your post!
Old AF and on Day One of stimulants ever,Thank you! Strattera was such a disappointment.
Old AF and on Day One of stimulants ever,"I understand it will take time to find the correct dosage. I just thought I would feel “something”. But time will tell, I know."
Old AF and on Day One of stimulants ever,Yeah that comment is making me think I need a higher dose lol
Old AF and on Day One of stimulants ever,"It was something a psychiatrist I used to see said to me. I said it to other psychiatrists I have seen since then and they all said something like, ""Yea that sounds about right."" I don't think it's any kind of standard metric but I found out later that the one who said it to me is considered by the psychiatric community to be the most well versed in ADHD in my area so I feel like it's a good metric."
Old AF and on Day One of stimulants ever,Hopefully you're not one of the 13% who don't respond to stimulants at all. No reason to assume you are.  First you can try up to the max dose of methylphenidate.  After that you can try amphetamines.
Old AF and on Day One of stimulants ever,Same 😂
Old AF and on Day One of stimulants ever,The funny thing for me is I have never been able to test it because I never try to read anything boring. Especially for 45 minutes...
Old AF and on Day One of stimulants ever,Thanks. I am pretty sure my body reacts to stimulants after having pure mah hwang (epheda) once in Amsterdam. I could hear the blood flowing in my ears and was a little freaked out!
Just started out,"Welcome to the club.

Yes, impostor syndrome is a real thing. The thing is, the treatment worked. Whatever it is that you may have, likely ADHD, was clearly helped by this treatment. And no psychiatric diagnosis is set in stone, as the brain is quite literally the most complicated organ in the universe.

  
Yes. This is how it works. Concerta won't do your work for you. It just makes it not feel excruciating for our different brains. This is also the start, and there is somewhat of a ""beginning euphoria"". But, the effects don't go away when the euphoria goes. You'll still function. The quiet is the best part. When i first started, i spent four hours bawling my eyes out because i had never known what quiet was in my brain before.


Yes, it is completely normal to not feel any transition. ADHD medication, unlike actual drugs, is very subtle. Especially extended-release formulations. They kick in and wean off gradually by dropping down. As you go longer, you may form some degree of tolerance, which is normal and can happen to anyone. After all, 18mg is the starting dose, and is usually little. Most settle around the 36-54mg mark. You take the pill with a full glass of water \[IMPORTANT\]. It starts kicking in in as little as 15 minutes, where if you try to sleep you won't be able to, and the full effects come on at around the 40-50 minute mark. The pill stops releasing at its peak at about 6-7 hours in, after which for another 3-4 hours your body does the rest, slowly eliminating the compound as it starts to wear off. After it's worn off, you may feel tired, your symptoms slowly come back (much like a normal person, you can't focus at the end of a long day), you get hungrier and you feel more tired.

Please don't blame yourself about the ""drugged up for being lazy"" part. We don't know what ADHD really is, we just have some sort of a general idea, and we know that throwing dopamine at it works. It's a disorder characterized by a vehement refusal of the brain (in most cases) to engage with things it doesn't find in the NICU criterion, that is, Novelty/Challenge/Interest/Urgency. Of course, this is just the tip of the iceberg, and there are many things you will learn about your new life on medication. It is normal.

In any case, read around the sub, and welcome :)  
We've been in your shoes, and still are. I'm also 22 and about to graduate in Electronics and Communications Engineering in a top 50 university, something i would not dare dream of unmedicated. This is to point out that things from now on will change very fast, as you start to fully absorb the concept of what i would confidently call a new life, now that you can actually work towards what you want.

# Some tips:
### Eat well.
Stimulants suppress appetite. Make sure to eat well and eat enough. Stimulants can't stimulate if your brain is running on fumes.

### Sleep well.
Sleep at the same time, wake up at the same time, and sleep a good amount. Your brain needs to replenish its' neurotransmitters.

### Take the pill at consistent times.
Taking the pill at the same time every day (or close) helps keep the time gap between doses consistent, reducing the likelihood of developing a tolerance.

### Exercise.
Exercise helps you feel good, look good, and it increases a lot of your neurotransmitters. I consider it my second medication.

### Stay hydrated.
Seriously. Stimulants make you pee like crazy. Dehydration can cause brain fog and irritability, and generally sucks.

### Take your vitamins and minerals.
It helps to not be deficient in things. Especially iron, B vitamins and magnesium.

### Create a routine.
Break things down in chunks, establish a routine and do everything step by step. Don't get trapped in the urge to do everything at once. Learned habits and learned procrastination are something you'll need to work on breaking now that you are medicated.


Good luck!"

Just started out,"Thank you so much for your comment, it reassured me so much. I didn't expect the medication to just get me out of bed and make me do stuff, but I was still fascinated to see how easy it is when I think about how I want to do that and actually do it right at that moment. I didn't cry the first day, but I was so in shock at how much can be done in a day when you can just function normally. I've experienced moments of quiet brain before, it was not continuously noisy inside, but instead most of the time and I rarely caught myself having 0 thoughts. But now, experiencing a full day of quietness was honestly so life changing, I didn't even realize this is how most people are!! I thought everyone has a song constantly playing in the back of their head amongst other thoughts and that the moments of not thinking about anything were rare for them as well.

Indeed, at the end of the day I feel tired, less focused and motivated, much like I felt before. I guess what I don't notice is when my brain starts getting noisy again, but I definitely notice it right before falling asleep (though I've always kind of liked daydreaming about a lot of stuff before bed). 

I too am an engineering student by the way :D This is my last year of Computer Engineering at one of the top universities in my country and it's been pretty hard the entire time I've been here (went from an average to top student in high school to ""just barely making it"" in college). I really hope I can turn things around this year though. I can't wait to see where I'll get from now on, I'm very excited for what's to come :D

I want to say thanks a lot for the tips too. Thankfully, I have no problem with eating well since I've been working with a nutritionist this year and I can finally say I have organized my meals. I still have some issues with sleeping (but I'm getting there too) and a very big issue with hydration. I'll try to remember taking the pill with a big glass of water instead of the little gulp I've done the past couple days and also I'll try waking up at about the same hour everyday, I didn't know that not taking it at the same time daily could lead to a tolerance. Is it true about tolerance resetting when not taking it for a few days?

Overall, thank you so much for the support! Happy to be here :)"
Just started out,"Not taking it at the same time everyday is not proven to contribute to tolerance or anything, but from a strictly scientific standpoint, it would be the best to try to take it as consistently as possible, because the recovery time between each dose would be consistent. Think of it like your brain ""recharging"". If you take it too inconsistently, you may end up with less ""time to recharge"" and that can build up.

  
Also, yes. In my personal experience at least, not taking it for a few days does increase effectiveness a lot for me. I prefer skipping weekends if i dont have something to do."
Just started out,"Oh, I understand, kinda like with antibiotics. I always disregarded taking anything that wasn't an antibiotic at the same time everyday, but I recently learned this kinda goes with every pill you take."
Just started out,"yes, but antibiotics are meant to be taken at consistent times because you need to keep the same blood concentration up, because you dont just need to take an antibiotic to destroy the bacteria, you need to take it at the correct dose. Too low of a concentration or too short a treatment and surviving cells may replicate and re-infect you. But yeah. The ""break"" after it's stopped working for the day for concerta should also be consistent to allow the acute tolerance to go down as much as possible before the next dose."
Just started out,"Thanks, I'll discuss with my psychiatrist next month and see if I can skip taking the pill on the weekends sometimes :D"

bye bye concerta!👋,"I have been on Concerta 18mg since February and it completely changed my life..
I could action absolutely anything and felt like I had balls of steel but was very grounded at the same time... I then increased to 36 but then my dry mouth and voice box,throat symptoms got very bad ...dry mouth and ulcers on my tongue.. I have sore throat and what the specialist said was silent reflux I'm not sure how I felt about this diagnosis however when I swapped to vyvanse 40mg my symptoms have got much better...but its making me feel flat and I'm spending more time in bed and not as motivated or what I call on fire in my actions.. it's also making me want to eat sugar which I've been off since February and felt so much better for... at 3:00 p.m. today I topped it up with a dex  5mg... I'm thinking about going back on Concerta 18 mg because I was just so much more functional.  weight gain is a big thing for me and it's certainly not what I want or to be binging again. Also I have quit weed but when I smoked it even three puffs I almost felt drugged and was asleep instantly and felt so drugged in the morning has anybody else experienced any of this thanks it is a great thing that I've given up with though although sometimes it is nice to have on occasion thanks"
bye bye concerta!👋,the issues were just the constant overstimulation. i’m autistic and the constant background static became too much for when i wasn’t in school. it worked perfectly for my attention in school it just wasn’t working with my daily life. i was prescribed anywhere in between 18-72 mg depending on my day. if i have a long day at school id usually take 54mg if i had a calm day with no extra curriculars and no school id just take 18mg. i only ever took 72mg once and it was way too much for me. but my prescription says i can take 1-4 pills. (my pills are 18mg)
bye bye concerta!👋,"Thanks.

I’m AuDHD, and have also had issues on Concerta.

It seems that if we’re on the spectrum, that makes us more hypersensitive to all sorts of meds that others widely tolerate without problems."
"Just started concerta today, what should I expect?",I take 18 mg Concerta and I’ve been on that dose for a month.  This month she upped my dose to 1  18mg x2 a day.  I felt like it was wearing off really early leaving me feeling a bit scattered in the early afternoon.  So I will be taking the other 18 mg around lunch time.  Don’t expect anything huge as far as a feeling with 18mg.  It’s really subtle and easy going.  It’s not like a amped up feeling like most drugs for ADHD Atleast not a 18 mg.  That’s just my opinion because I’ve taken others like Vyvanse and Adderall.   Concerta is different in the way it releases in your body.  So just be patient and keep a journal of how you’re feeling and be sure to stay hydrated and report any concerns with your doctor.  Good luck!!

"Just started concerta today, what should I expect?","Make sure to drink electrolytes , in my experience they help a lot in the afternoon , it’s my second week now I’m also interested in losing weight but it hasn’t stopped my appetite the way I wanted so I can still eat and still get hungry but I don’t seem to crave as much junk food I’m tracking my calories a lot easier , before the idea of tracking everything I ate made me want to die 😂 but now it feels easier and it’s kind of how I see the medication working it makes things easier but you still have to make yourself do things but I find once I start a task I can’t stop until it’s done , I haven’t started exercise yet but I will after another month to see where I am with dosage etc I do find myself more active in work and not as exhausted by task so my step count is up so I think I will lose weight but in a slow healthy way"
"Just started concerta today, what should I expect?","By 18 mg i wouldn’t be concerned. I recently started with 27 mg and it doesnt feel like much, i just feel calm. It can increase your hertbeat a little but its very normal. And my brain feels just silent for the very First time in my life. If your anxiety is induced by your ADHD then you may also feel a little less anxious. I am, but it’s not completely gone. It made me also a bit sleepy and a little brain fog but it gets better as your body gets used to the medication. The thing is also you have to find the right dosage for you which may be tricky,  most people start with 18 or 27 mg and increase the dosage gradually. I would recommend that you take notes about how you feel so that you have something to talk with your psychiatrist the next time."
"Just started concerta today, what should I expect?","I totrated from 18mg to 54mg which I'm staying on. One thing I'd say is be patient it takes a while to get used to although you may not feel much from 18mg but trust the process and work your way to your optimal dose slowly they start u off slow for a reason. I rushed when I was on elvanse and lost 2 stone and got severely depressed hence I switched to concerta which I find gentle and less of a hit when I take it and less of a come down. 

That being said u may crash its normal, so work with it and take some downtime around that time of day ie don't give yourself loads to do when u need to rest. 

I found it took a month for the tiredness to subside... it hit me hard on the first day of 18mg I had to go nap but like I say give it time side effects do settle its hard when u have adhd as your impatient but it's certainly a journey. 

Make sure you eat even if your not hungry. 

Concerta made me really agitated in the first few weeks again that's settled but I've also learnt medication is only half the battle you need to do the work for it to help ie plan your day the night before, don't be hard on yourself, eat, drink water even if you don't want to. Allocate self care time ie a bath and time to rest 

Obviously and I'm sure this won't happen but if you have serious side effects call your doctor- listen to your body and i have found now that I don't feel medicated like I did at the start so things ARE settling down

Good luck x"
"Just started concerta today, what should I expect?","The consistent appetite but decreased cravings is what i experienced at first too, and i have a hypothesis:  

cravings are not hunger, they are your brain demanding reward. Same with drugs, yeah, if that analogy helps. Now, reward is mediated by dopamine, and with the extra dopamine from meds, your brain just doesnt need that trick so much anymore...."
"Just started concerta today, what should I expect?",I think you are correct because I can still eat chocolate and sure it tastes like chocolate but I don’t get the rush I used too it’s still good but I’m not compelled to seek more
Great results but social anxiety?,Zero anxiety for me I’m on 36mg twice daily I prefer it over Adderall and vyvanse

Great results but social anxiety?,I mean sure. Hmu whenever
I’ve never had a crash anyone have any idea why,"That might be a sign that this medication is right for you. I don’t feel a crash from Concerta either, either name brand or generic. Unlike Elvanse, which I definitely felt when it wore off (it felt really like an off switch), I don’t feel that moment at all with Concerta.

It’s a good thing! Don’t overthink it and enjoy it!"
I’ve never had a crash anyone have any idea why,you are concerta’s chosen one 🫢
I’ve never had a crash anyone have any idea why,"Not everybody has a crash. It's hard to say why because it's just kinda ""idk, brains"". Everyone's biochemistry and neural wiring is different."

I’ve never had a crash anyone have any idea why,"I've been taking 36 mg for a week now and have never experienced a crash either. I'm working my way up to 54 mg though, so we'll see."
I’ve never had a crash anyone have any idea why,I’m on 36 mg and I’m not sure if this is the crash you are referring to but my first week of taking it I had extreme headaches around the 10-12 hour period after taking the medication. Also my appetite would come back but not as intense when I first started on a lower dose
I’ve never had a crash anyone have any idea why,"only been about 3 months for myself. No crashes, and I take 27mg every day with no off days, I don't feel as if it has caused any tolerance.  But... I would like it to last longer, currently, for about 5 hours max, I get the benefit of it helping with attention and focus, especially when it comes to reading/studying... it would be great if it lasted twice as long."
I’ve never had a crash anyone have any idea why,I'm on day 3 of 27 and I had those headaches yesterday... I realized I didn't drink enough water with electrolytes.  Felt it coming today and seemed to keep it at bay with electrolytes.  I think that was it anyway.   Was on generic and it was all over the place for me and side effects... the name brand has been so much smoother.
I’ve never had a crash anyone have any idea why,Yeah that’s what I figured worked in my case too my increasing my water intake. Do you take electrolytes separate/ mix it into your water ?
I’ve never had a crash anyone have any idea why,"Mix it into my water.  I found them without ascorbic acid.  Have it in the morning, when I workout and sometimes in the evening."
I’ve never had a crash anyone have any idea why,Oh that’s awesome! I will have to try that!!!
"Quit caffeine, while on concerta","Yeah I’ve been drinking coffee for 20 years and own $10k of coffee equipment including home roaster, but I had to scale caffeinated coffee right back to a single cup a day, and only before 8am. It was a sad day when I realised that’s how much I had to drop, but I’d take the benefits of concerta over more coffee every time.

Maybe during my holidays I’ll have a break from concerta and just drink coffee and enjoy it.

If I have a second coffee now it’s always decaf, and decaf is good, just less variety available."
"Quit caffeine, while on concerta","Hi, have been on 36mg methylphenidate for over a year. Start the morning with one up avenge size around 6am. Take the pill no later than 730. Dont recall papatation or any side effects. Might be a small adjustment before they go away. Originally, I gave up coffee when I started but went back to it a few weeks in. No issue so far. Good luck."
"Quit caffeine, while on concerta",Decaf gives me the joy without the jitters
"Quit caffeine, while on concerta",Caffeine is such a shitty stimulant
"Quit caffeine, while on concerta",I like to drink lots of water and less caffine on Concerta so i fully support this message🙏🏽🫡🚰
"Quit caffeine, while on concerta","I just recently started on concerta 36mg and i use to drink alot of coca-cola, now i cut it down to two, one in the morning and one in the late afternoon. I feel good this way. No side effects from the concerta"
"Quit caffeine, while on concerta","28 here as well, started meds back in July, after I learned that caffeine was making the crash worse I haven't gone back! No cravings either.

Edit: To add, I've always had a VERY high tolerance for Caffeine, I was drinking about a red bull a day, sometimes two throughout my teens and early 20s, I started drinking Coffee more regularly after 25 and would average at least 4-5 cups a day - Before I learned about ADHD I always assumed that I was just immune to caffeine in the sense that it would wake you up, I always felt drowsy after my morning up"
"Quit caffeine, while on concerta",No real effect on me. 36mg daily with 2 monsters.
"Quit caffeine, while on concerta","Yup, same here. I quit caffeine for over 2 weeks now and I'm feeling a lot better. Ritalin is a way better stimulant than caffeine."
"Quit caffeine, while on concerta",I went back down to 18mg and can safely enjoy my coffee again. I enjoy the more subtle effect and it let’s me indulge in other things I enjoy without freaking out.
"Quit caffeine, while on concerta","Yes. Had to stop for the same reasons. Been off it for quite a while. Decaf doesn’t usually make me as anxious/stressed tho so I have it sometimes, I tried chickory as a replacement and I liked it but I’ve been drinking hot chocolate a lot lately haha sometimes you just need a hot drink. I found a huge improvement to my mood, sleep, and don’t feel as stressed/ tight chest."
"Quit caffeine, while on concerta","I switched completely to green/black tea, since it has L-theanine. It might help with improve effects of methylphenidate.

I might drink coffee sometimes but just purely for taste."

"Quit caffeine, while on concerta","It is always recommended to stop drinking coffee when introducing methylphenidate (ritalin / concerta). 
When I started my treatment with Ritalin, despite drinking coffee 2/3 hours before taking Ritalin, I was quite stressed too. 
Nowadays with concerta I avoid coffee, I don't feel the stress I felt with Ritalin. However, if I am going to drink coffee, it is little and always before taking medication."
"Quit caffeine, while on concerta","Yah, I don't mix the two.  Even if I take a Concerta at 6am and don't drink caffeine until 6pm, it's not great. I get a little buzzy and about 5 hours later my BP goes up to 130/90 and I get a headache when the norepinephrine hits, and I don't even have high BP."
"Quit caffeine, while on concerta","I actually realized I have to drink it. Sometimes at least 150mg of caffeine. 1st time it gave me anxiety, fast heartbeat and so on... But after drinking it on the comedown, I was actually feeling good. Now I drink it after a few hours of taking it (like 3?) and I take a pill suplement right after waking up, that has 100mg caffeine in it as well, but that isn't much noticable. I'm on 54mg concerta, I started taking it like 3 weeks ago.
Caffeine gives me that ""it"" feeling and maybe it's the withdrawal."
"Quit caffeine, while on concerta",[removed]
"Quit caffeine, while on concerta","Before concerta, coffee did nothing for me lol i could drink espresso shots on shots and still sleep like a baby, never felt like it woke me up yadda yadda

  
I don't drink coffee anymore on days i take concerta because it keeps me up... like it would for typical person"
"Quit caffeine, while on concerta","Yes. I drank coffee every day for 25 years, always enjoyed it immensely, had to quit coffee on concerta because it makes my heart race and just feel overall unpleasant."
"Quit caffeine, while on concerta","I was disgustingly self-medicating with coffee and energy drinks but on my second day of Concerta even a sip made me feel SO overwhelmingly unwell. Sweats, palpitations, extreme nausea etc 
My body is pretty good at telling me when it does and doesn’t want, so I listened. 

I went out the next day and bought some yummy ceylon teas in different flavours and now I’m a tea person lol 
I miss coffee occasionally for the taste but that’s what decaf is for now. 

It’s been 18 months without coffee/energy drinks and I would never go back. My skin is better, my diet is better, my weight/bloating has reduced immensely. It’s been one of the best things to cut out for me"
"Quit caffeine, while on concerta","I mostly to good quality Swiss water decaf for my morning coffee when I started Concerta, I’ll sometimes mix a little regular coffee in if I feel like it. Definitely happier without the caffeine when I’m on Concerta. I sometimes have a regular coffee in the early afternoon and that works well for me."
"Quit caffeine, while on concerta",I switched from my normal coffee order to a small tea. Much less caffeine than a xl coffee
"Quit caffeine, while on concerta",Starting to get a very bad headache right now. Its so annoying :/ im not gonna drink
"Quit caffeine, while on concerta",Glad to hear if works for u. Im gonna take a break from Coffee.
"Quit caffeine, while on concerta",Heard about it. Maybe I should try
"Quit caffeine, while on concerta","Yea, I couldnt function without Coffee now its been 1 day. I still crave, I even want to drink rn a cup. But im gonna try 2 weeks without to see if theres a diffrents"

"Quit caffeine, while on concerta",That’s the worst part..l the withdrawal headaches… but it passes after a few days

"Quit caffeine, while on concerta",I like the n/a corona... tastes the same
Adderall to Concerta?,Methylphenidate I find is a lot more… gentle than amphetamines? Give it some time. It should be a good choice of medication without you really feeling it or knowing it is there.
Adderall to Concerta?,Adderall is more potent by MG then concerta but my doctor gave me a week trial of adderall to see if I like it better then concerta and nope. You’ll most likely need a dosage raise im on 54mg right now moving up to max dose 72mg next. You’re on the lowest dose right now so you’ll forsure need your dosage raised.

Adderall to Concerta?,"My doctor just called me back this morning and told me to double my 18s and to check back with him when I run out.  I am starting to feel or notice a calming effect.

If this does not work out then he said that I have the option to change to Adderall.  I asked him if there are any other options and he said Wellbutrin.

I have been on both Adderall and Wellbutrin, and I am hoping that Concerta will give me what I need.  I think that my tolerance to Adderall is too high."
