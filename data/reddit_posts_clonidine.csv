Clonidine has changed my son's life,"Congrats =) 

So great to hear positive stories! It must be such a challenge trying to advocate for your children when they are struggling, sounds like you’re doing a great job. I hope things continue to improve!"
Clonidine has changed my son's life,I’m intrigued. How does clonidine work?
Clonidine has changed my son's life,My son is on that combo and it has been life changing.  He used to toss and turn and not be able to sleep and then be uncomfortable because he hadn’t slept.  He can sleep now.  We can sleep now.  He’s doing much better in school.  He communicates primarily through an AAC so the sleep and the calm helps him push only the buttons he means to.  Life changing.
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"33m in Guanfacine, and it is night and day. Would’ve improved my DRASTICALLY for the short and long term if I could’ve experienced my thoughts and feelings and sensitivity chill out. It’s a life changer if it works. Very happy for your child and you to get to experience this, even if it’s short. I promise you it’s an amazing feeling and relief to just do something."
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"Amazing!  I've been on it for 25 years at night,  and Ritalin during the day. I simply do not function without the clonidine. I can get by without the Ritalin if I have to, but the clonidine is what controls a lot of my worst symptoms"
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"One thing to look out for: in really rare situations, clonidine can cause sleep walking. I would sleep eat (like sleep walk while binge eating) nightly for the 6 weeks I was on it and gained 16lbs."
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"This worked well for my daughter in helping calm her down and getting her to go to bed. The effects were much the same as melatonin for her. She could never take it in the morning, she’d be asleep at school!"
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"From a thread a couple years ago for anyone curious:

Clonidine can be used off label as a treatment for ADHD. It isn’t commonly prescribed, because guanfacine (Intuniv) is in the same drug class and approved for ADHD treatment.

Clonidine is shorter acting than Intuniv. When it is prescribed, it is usually prescribed to be taken at night. It lowers blood pressure and provides a somewhat sedative effect. Some people have difficulty winding down after using stimulants during the day to function. Clonidine in the evening can help this transition. 

Intuniv on the other hand is longer acting. It is useful for those who have impulsivity and hyperactivity as part of their ADHD symptoms. Taken at bedtime, it is designed to alleviate these issues in the same way clonidine does… and can provide relief from irritability, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. It is designed to last 24 hours but for some this can cause sedation during the daytime even when paired with stimulants. 


----

My own experience is Clonidine at night helped a lot with sleep. I am very prone to side effects and I only have a little dry mouth. Plus the anxiety benefits from blood pressure I could feel literally the first time I took the medication. For ADHD, the benefits are not suppose to materialize for about 4-6(?) weeks. 


I haven't had a medication work this well maybe ever."
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"I didn't notice many cognitive changes taking clonidine but for some reason it tunes up my hand-eye-coordination so i'm not so much of a klutz.  Wouldn't give it up for anything.  

However, OP it makes my mouth drier than the desert portions of Arrakis.  Which comes with an increased risk of oral cancers.  If they are not very verbal, make sure you have ample water available 30 min or so after taking."
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"Happy for you. What you describe sounds heartbreaking and just so stressful. Trying to be patient and not losing your shit as a dad going thru that sounds really tough. Our son is on Guanfacine after about 4 years on stimulants. And it’s working really well. He’s eating again, slowing down and stops and thinks before he blurts out something or just acts upon his impulses. If we forget a dose he is very hyper and a bit off the rails. And he kinda likes that. But his peers reject him, so we are explaining to him that it’s in his best interest to take his medication. He’s learning about himself, and that’s a good thing.  Best of luck!"
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"My son started it a couple of weeks ago.   The first day I picked him up from school he was beaming! He said, “Dad I showed the class how big my brain is today.  I think the medicine worked!!”  

Needless to say my wife and I were in tears."
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"Hooray! 
I take Clonidine too, but at night because I'm an extremely light sleeper. I can go to sleep no problem, but staying asleep is a big challenge. For the first time in a long time (maybe ever?) I'm sleeping through the night consistently. It's been a big game changer, a good night's rest makes all my symptoms so much more manageable."
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"Thanks for sharing! My situation is very different from your son’s, but my doctor wants to try clonidine next if what I’m on isn’t working (and it doesn’t seem to be), so it’s good to hear success stories! Bonus, it lowers blood pressure, which I need."
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"My psychiatrist added clonidine to my medications about a year ago to help me primarily because I was having trouble sleeping and it happened to be helpful but I also just ""felt better"" I do not really know how else to explain it. 

Mainly in my ability to handle my emotions in situations that normally would stress me out and result in anger and frustration. Not free from anger and frustration by any means but my ability to remain composed and clear headed in those situations grew as well as many of the other issues I have with emotional regulation. I didn't really know how else to explain it to my doctor other than I just felt better and more relaxed. 

That has fostered a new level of confidence in myself that has led me to excel in my new job and let go of some of the bad I carried with me as well as becoming a better listener, being more optimistic and mindful every single day. 

I'm glad your son has also gained some relief as well as you getting some relief yourself!"
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"I was prescribed Clonidine for blood pressure but I noticed an increase in better quality moods and mental clarity. I believe it works by opening up blood vessels in the head, unfortunately that can also cause people like myself to pass out when standing up. I had to switch to something else."
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"Clonidine stopped me from having nightmares every night (PTSD) and helps me fall asleep. Game changer for me and clearly for many others, in different ways"
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"Glad to hear it! I also take Clonidine, but in my case it was prescribed because when I started taking stimulant meds, I was feeling the side effects more than the benefits. My psychiatrist said that having heightened sensitivity (to lights, sounds, medications) was more common in people with ADHD. Taking Clonidine helped with that general sensitivity, and made Ritalin actually work for me. 


 The fact that it *also* makes me sleepy at night is a huge benefit, I used to have problems with my mind racing at night, but now I can fall asleep fairly regularly (as long as I remember to take my nighttime pills a few hours before bed.) "
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"One of my besties has a daughter who sounds much like your son. (Her husband has ADHD, so the possibility of autistic children was always there.) I think they are in the process of getting her set up on clonidine. Great to hear about your good experience!"
Clonidine has changed my son's life,Congratulations!!!!! You both deserve this.
Clonidine has changed my son's life,I am so so happy for you guys! ☺️☺️☺️ Meds can truly be life changing.
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"Neuro-scientist here, I concur with the physician  about the nurse being absolutely spot on"
Clonidine has changed my son's life,Have you tried risperidone?  It can be tricky with the weight gain but isn't as sedating.  We use both clonidine and risperidone on each of our kids.  Just keep risperidone in the back of your head just in case you need it.  I'm so glad you found something that is working!
Clonidine has changed my son's life,That's wonderful news!
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"Some meds are a miracle, i experienced the same with Ritalin, it’s not perfect, but the difference is night and day, glad you found something that helps!"
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"Interestingly, I was never diagnosed formally with ADHD as a kid. But I was given clonidine to help me sleep. I still had a lot of ADHD signs but was always treated for anxiety and OCD instead, despite my therapist suggesting ritalin. 

I wonder how many of my ADHD symptoms were masked due to the clonidine."
Clonidine has changed my son's life,Clonidine changed my life in that now I can get through the work day and complete tasks.
Clonidine has changed my son's life,keep a good eye on his blood pressure. if he starts to look more tired than normal or complaining of headaches his bp could be dropping. it happened to my sister and she started feeling really horrible after the first week or so
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"this is one of the reasons I tell people not to get upset if a prescriber doesn’t immediately prescribe a stimulant medication. They should be considering all the symptoms of that individual and trying the best fits. I see so many posts here from people frustrated that they got prescribed something like Wellbutrin first, and I always say to give it a try before getting frustrated. 

Thanks for sharing this, it’s a great example of how we don’t all fit into the same boxes!"
Clonidine has changed my son's life,We had a very similar experience when we switched from clonidine to guanfacine for my autistic+ADHD daughter’s severe insomnia. We had been using clonidine for 6 years with less and less sleep each night when we made the switch and now she sleeps wonderfully. Now she is present and engaged with her surroundings everyday. We are so much happier as a family.
Clonidine has changed my son's life, love this!!! i also started taking clonidine at 18 with my adhd meds because my sleep was sooo beyond terrible before getting diagnosed at all but since then it’s been such a game changer for my sleep!!
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"Be careful with Clonidine. Once your child starts taking it , he needs to keep taking it and at a consistent dosage. It is not a great blood pressure medicine and if someone ceases using it, it can cause dangerous blood pressure spikes.

Clonidine has changed my son's life,"Clonidine was life changing for me, as well. I started taking it for tics and it ended up doing so much more. The biggest change, for me, was with my OCD. I had extremely distressing intrusive thoughts - basically my brain just spamming horrible gore imagery at me 24/7. I couldn't function. A few months after starting clonidine, I realized suddenly that my intrusive thoughts had faded away. I couldn't remember the last time I'd had one. They were so nonexistent that I hadn't even noticed they were gone. I cried a lot. Realizing I was free from my own brain was an unexplainable feeling. It's been a few years since then and I do, occasionally, get flares where the intrusive thoughts come back, but I'm able to quiet them pretty easily.

It's also done wonders for my ADHD and pretty much eliminated my depression and most of my anxiety. I was completely nonfunctional prior to starting it. In bed all day every day, smoking weed whenever I was awake because being high felt better than the brain fog and anxiety, and I couldn't think while sober anyway. My therapist was wonderful but had realized that she couldn't do anything to help me get better, she was just a lifeline at that point. All of that changed. I was able to actually benefit from therapy, I stopped needing to be high, I had actual energy, and I could think for the first time in years."
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"I also take Clonidine at night. Another interesting use for it is PTSD dreams and night terrors, which is what it was prescribed to me for primarily. Oddly helpful. Bad dreams are just bad dreams not bonkers flashbacks."
Clonidine has changed my son's life,What are some of the benefits of of clonidine I’ve got adhd and would like to know good and bad side effects
Clonidine has changed my son's life,Warning: I took clonidine as a kid and it worsened my nightmares. My current psychiatrist told me that it does worsen vivid nightmares and can increase night epilepsy.
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"That's awesome! I use clonidine for my physical symptoms of anxiety. They tried guanfacine, but supposedly for adults it's rarer for it to assist. But I hear it's amazing for people it does work for so that's amazing!"
Clonidine has changed my son's life,I love to hear this.
Clonidine has changed my son's life,That’s great to hear! My sister has been on clonidine for as long as I can remember. Wishing you the best!
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"I am so happy to hear that! For me, clonidine has been the perfect sleep aide since I have high blood pressure as well. I can't do it in the mornings, though, I will start falling asleep at my desk. I'm so glad it's making a difference for you and your son :)"
Clonidine has changed my son's life, By far the only med i actively think doctors should never be able to prescribe. That med had the weirdest derealization to it and made me feel like shit
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"Clonidine really does seem to help a lot with emotional regulation, more so than guanfacine from what I have seen. My son has been on both."
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"This so awesome!
Here comes an ADHD overshare…
TLDR-keep an eye out if he gets constipated on clonidine.


Adult ADHD with suspected AU + some other co morbidities…I have tried everything available so far publicly, 6 diff types/combos and can’t really afford vyvanse, or guanfacine neither of which are funded here, but nothing gives me a lot of impact/relief, i was taking dex (adderal) and Clonidine, because it seemed to give me a little more benefit than dex alone.
BUT the side effect from Clonidine, constipation, became too much, even with a laxative, I stopped and haven’t really felt enough difference to add it back in."
Clonidine has changed my son's life,Happy for you! We use clonidine for sleep. Risperidone was the game changer for our days
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"I recently started on clonidine, and I gotta say, it’s been life changing for me as well! So much less ADHD-induced anxiety"
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"Clonidine has been the only thing that helps with my sleep. Better than Ambien, and I don’t wake up feeling hung over!"
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"I wouldn’t have thought that Guanfacine and Clonidine could be taken together, aren’t they very similar to one another?

Disclaimer: I’m not medically trained at all - this is a genuine question.

Also, super happy that you found a combination that works - I have a 14 year old son with autism and ADHD, and we’re still fine-tuning. He was diagnosed with autism just before he was 3, and started medication when he was about 6-7."
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"I take 0.2 at night. As a major grown-up (lol!!) for me it made my embarassed/horrified/hurt/waaaaaah meter become much less highly tuned, and also my sleep - I get a lot more deep sleep than I used to (smartwatch before and after are really illuminating). The extra nudge to go to sleep (if you don't fight it - you can if your brain is extra annoyed and circly) is also nice. I'm sure it's this less 'overeactive' aspect plus more deep sleep which you are noticing! I'm so glad to read your post - Keep being a great parent, we are all not perfect, but man having engaged and loving parents in your corner will really help."
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"I am just so happy for you, you can't even imagine. Thank goodness you found this answer. Bless you and your sweet boy ♥️"
Clonidine has changed my son's life,My psychiatrist prescribed atomoxine 10 mg bd
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"OP  SAME! 
I also take it and it's been so very helpful to me too. 

Clondine has been a literal lifesaver for us both. 

It's so helpful for us and I'm really glad to read it works for your son too. ❤"
Clonidine has changed my son's life,Mine too!! I call it my miracle drug!
Clonidine has changed my son's life,i read this as cloning
Clonidine has changed my son's life,My daughter at 9:00 is on quantity to help her sleep which of course when she gets better sleep helps with the other ADHD symptoms but I especially am with you on the whole sentiment of the kid getting better sleep or having the good side effects or effects from the clonidine definitely helps us be better parents and that I think is one of the best ways because us being better parents allow us to help them and so many more ways than we can't if we're always pressed out exhausted and all that fun stuff.
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"My psych has put me on clonidine but I feel like I am moving through sludge. He used it to help me with anxiety. I do not feel relief from anything. I suppose I am sleeping well, but I didn't have a problem sleeping before. I was on citalopram for depression, anxiety, and panic attacks after my sister passed away suddenly in 2011. It worked well until the last two years. In 2022 I was dxd with ADHD and went on Adderall which seemed to help..then I got a more stressful job and needed more Adderall. So I went up and got extended release. Anxiety got worse, depression got worse, marriage got worse. One therapist said I was bipolar. I'm not. One psych then put me on extended release Xanax daily. That did seem to help the daily feeling of butterflies in my chest but nothing else. 

New psych weaned me totally off citalopram, I stopped the Adderall too. Then he started me on fluoxetine and buproprione. I had daily afternoon attacks of rage and anxiety and I was just angry all the time and still crying all the time. I went to the ER with shortness of breath and chest pains. Doc put me on clonidine. Nothing wrong with my heart he said. Just med chnages. 

Psych and i decided to try paxil. I hated that bc mood was better but anxiety was still there. Then I had a week long migraine. So psych decided to wait until migraine was over (neurologist treated with steroids) and now I'm just hanging here on clonidine with a husband who is angry with me for being erratic and moody. 

Oh, and I'm 48, menopausal and I live with 3 teenagers and an ADHD 11 year-old."
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"I'm so so happy for you, him and your family!! I can sense your gratitude in your words. I have severe mixed ADHD so insomnia has always been a part of who I am unfortunately. Insomnia is literally the worst thing in the world for me. Brain is ALWAYS in hyperdrive so it's very rare for me to feel the amazing gift of feeling ""sleepy"" or interrupted sleep in general. Sleep is the only part of my day that I get relief from the incessant rabbit holes my mind always plunders through, one after the other.

Once I started clonodine for the 2nd half of my day, wowwwww! I actually feel ""at rest"" and I don't fidget or get migraines. I can focus on just breathing and being in the moment of my surroundings without my brain overanalyzing. It really has helped enhance my life and I'm so happy it has helped your son's as well!! Cheers to balancing out brain chemistry, Woooo!"
Clonidine has changed my son's life,I have only been taking it for a week now and have already noticed a difference. I am curious if anyone else has had any of these side effects. Loss of appetite. I am experiencing this so bad. Headaches if I wait to long to take it. Also up until yesterday my eye was constantly twitching. I have not read anything about this but did meet someone who experienced something similar. I think it has actually helped with my drowsiness throughout the day is that normal? Most people say it makes them super tired. Last is I keep getting extremely hot or cold.
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"This touched my heart because my parents never looked at what i'm eating or never considered that i may have ADHD. By your choice to medicate your son with such an amazing medication, you gifted him so much more life to live. An enjoyable life. My childhood was shaped by constant boredom and being forced to do things. I can't describe how much i believe you saved your sons future/quality of life"
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"You have the patience and understanding to help your son and are supportive! He is lucky to have you. 

Curious about the guanfacine. I was on it before a few times and didn’t really notice a difference. Do you think it works in conjunction with the other medication or together?"
Clonidine has changed my son's life,I’m on Vyvanse 40 mg once a day. And it does nothing for me at all.
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"Nurse here! I’ve given clonidine as a blood pressure medication in adults, but it has other uses.

It works by stimulating alpha receptors in your brain which sends signals that relax your blood vessels thereby lowering your heart rate and blood pressure! It’s used for ADHD, tics, anxiety 

Pretty cool!"
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"I’m taking it! We tried it along with an adderal in hopes it would help some anxiety tendencies such as overthinking. It has also been shown to affect some adhd things such as impulse control, motivation, and has been shown to help decrease some of the jittery feelings that come with stimulants. 

Ive found it to be pretty helpful! Not a major one that I noticed immediately, but enough that when I took a step back and thought about it I was like huh I have been doing more little things here and there as well as not feeling the stimulant jitters as much. I’m taking .1g in the morning and at night"
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"The VA has given it to me as anti anxiety when I didnt want benzodizapines (klonopin)...

It works pretty quickly as well, in about 30 or so minutes.

So you can take it if you are feeling stressed as a way to help level you out and take the edge off.

Ive taken hydroxyzine for sleep even though its an anti histamine. Knocks me out.

I try not to take anything scheduled if I can help it."
Clonidine has changed my son's life,Hello! What’s your dose? My son is 2 mg morning and we are thinking of trying 1 mg at night. He has anxiety later in the day so we think it’s wearing off.
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"Hi, had a question about Guanfacine - do you take it at night (before bed) or during the day?

My NP suggested it to me as well, and she gave me the immediate-release form to start at night."
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"My son did this! I'd wake up and find remnants of his snacks. lol.  At least it is not particularly harmful. Good idea to mention it to OP, so they are aware, and don't freak out if it happens!"
Clonidine has changed my son's life,I would think if Clonidine is also used for treating PTSD that sleepwalking would be more a sx of that. For others who read this comment if you don’t have PTSD.
Clonidine has changed my son's life,Didn’t still help at school even though she took it the night before or was it only to help with sleep?  What gather so far is that it can help with sleep and also with emotional regulation.
Clonidine has changed my son's life,Did he take am or pm? We just got this prescribed for mg daughter
Clonidine has changed my son's life,Do you only take in evening but still get benefits during day
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"My 14 year old has social anxiety and has developed a tic where he blinks his eyes very frequently. In your opinion could clonidine help with this? He also has a hard time falling asleep, usually takes at least an hour."
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"We did this for my daughter for a short time and it was amazing. But it is a very strong drug, so you have be careful with it (I’m sure you are!!). So we got her off as soon as we could. Taking it during puberty was the biggest concern. She’s tried many things since then, and this was still my favorite, but I didn’t feel the long term side effects were worth it. Best to you!"
Clonidine has changed my son's life,This is comforting to hear. I'm exploring this option for me. One of the biggest issues I have in life is starting work tasks because of all the anxiety and RSD I have to combat first.
Clonidine has changed my son's life,Do you take only at night or also daytime
Clonidine has changed my son's life,What physical symptoms did it help with?
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"I've used 20 and 30mg doses of Vyvanse. Both worked wonderful for me, but it turns out that 20mg was enough. The 30mg dose made me feel slightly jittery, and I don't have that at all with the 20mg. I used to get the brand name for free with a voucher program from the manufacturer. Unfortunately, now that the patent has expired, that program is no more. I've switched back to Adderall IR (generic) now. I use 10mg and it works well for maybe 5-6 hours or so.

My sister didn't like Vyvanse, but she does well with Adderall. I'm pretty sure we're both ADHD-PI. I suspect I may be very mildly autistic, but I've never been tested and it may just be typical traits of the ADHD."
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"We all metabolize things differently and don’t always fit into the categories our P rimary caregivers have developed for purposes of learning, tracking and protocols.  That is a fact. I actually found going down a bit gave me more “bang for my buck” so to speak. I generally have high tolerance/poor absorption, not sure which. Good luck to all of us dealing with all this fun."
Clonidine has changed my son's life,I can’t wait to tell my psychiatrist this shit sucks and it’s generic and it’s still expensive
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"Yeah that's a lot, I doubt you can feel much on that.   Honestly that's probably too high and by your cadence it seems like you use too much for wrong reaaon"
Clonidine has changed my son's life,My understanding is that specifically supports nREM sleep which is shown to be the cause of “externalising behaviour” in young autistic kids.
Clonidine has changed my son's life,Physician here. Nurse is absolutely on the spot with the explanation.
Clonidine has changed my son's life,My son was prescribed this we he was younger for ticks I guess you’d call it. Random movements with his jaw. Actually worked and he slept good every night. He’s 18 now and been off of it for about 5 years
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"""Off label"" usages seem to be the norm for ADHDers, to be fair, and can be pretty interesting.

Another fun example: both my son and I are on the same medication (sodium valproate) in similar dosages. Him for Epilepsy, me to soften the peaks and troughs of both cPTSD and GAD."
Clonidine has changed my son's life,Clonidine saved my life. I love it.
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"I was prescribed clonidine purely as a sleep aid when I was a child, as far as I know. I had been on it since an extremely young age (maybe 4 years old?). 

Is it sometimes used for this purpose as well? I wasn't formally diagnosed with ADHD as a child but I was diagnosed as having OCD and anxiety. But mainly, I couldn't sleep. I remember my mom crushing the tablet and mixing it with a spoonful of soda or juice for me to take every night. lol.

I don't believe it was for anxiety because I was put on prozac and paxil at later points in life while I was still on the clonidine iirc."
Clonidine has changed my son's life,Condone huh? I need to ask for this. Can it be taken with adderall??
Clonidine has changed my son's life,We lovingly call it “pure alpha” sometimes in the NICU. We use it in babies with withdrawal from poly-pharm stuff when an opioid is insufficient.
Clonidine has changed my son's life,Have you seen any patterns between kids who work well on clonidine and whether or not they end up working well on certain types of stimulants or the shepherd other types of stimulants if they have to move to them later on?
Clonidine has changed my son's life,Hey can I get some help with this? Today my heart felt really weird and like I couldn’t breath very well plus this would be my second time having heart palpitations when I go to sleep? And it will like just me out of my sleep is this normal?
Clonidine has changed my son's life,Then BUTEYKO breathwork method could also work similarly
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"Benadryl does that to me, literal walking zombie on that stuff!"
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"2mg and def not enough but I’m easing into it. I’m also a larger human and metabolize things quickly. My psych said he has patients on 6mg even tho the max dose is typically 4. All of his pts on it are diagnosed ASD and he said it’s been very successful. When I first took it, it was like I was feeling what humans feel for the first time. Pretty incredible med."
Clonidine has changed my son's life,I have extended. I was originally instructed to take at night but now I take it around 3p. For whatever reason I always experience a rut around 5p so it keeps me calm and active and typically rolls over to the following day.
Clonidine has changed my son's life,Also happy to answer any questions and feel free to dm me
Clonidine has changed my son's life,I’ve never sleep walked before or since and do not have PTSD.
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"Good question. We tried both immediate release and extended release. Immediate release, obviously immediately made her pretty drowsy and was out of her system by morning. We tried extended release in hopes that we would get some benefit of the pill in the morning until she had a chance to get her morning ADHD medicine (focalin) but we did not see that happen. My daughter metabolizes medicine very fast, so it was basically out of her system by morning thus no effect at school."
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"Yes, I take it with other medications before bed and I was able to actually feel and see the change after a week of adding it to my treatment. It also works helping me fall asleep"
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"I agree, clonidine is one of the drugs you try first while risperidone is one of the last drugs you try when nothing else works and their behaviours are severe."
Clonidine has changed my son's life,What were the long term side effects?
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"We haven't heard much from our provider about long term effects, but maybe it's a boy vs girl thing?  I'll definitely do some research now!  It helps with him getting stuck on things in his brain and ranting.  Unfortunately when he gets stuck, it sets our other autistic son off."
Clonidine has changed my son's life,I take it morning and night
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"Clonidine slows down my body's blood pressure I would say so while my mind may still be anxious my body is a lot less overwhelmed which is helpful in calming my anxiety down. Not as effective as my benzos were, but still better than nothing."
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"I couldn't help but giggle at ""this shit sucks.""  Boy, have I thought that many times! 


We never got to Vyvanse. I think this is our 10th medication change in just over a year. My son was first prescribed clonidine because he had so much trouble sleeping. 


Last week, we were told they couldn't up guanfacine anymore, he's already at a higher dose. But they proposed Dexedrine, we tried it for 2 days... Nope, nope, nope. 


 I was happy his pediatrician mentioned we could try more clonidine if  that didn't work. 


I have heard stimulants aren't effective for something like 20% of people with ADHD? 


After all of this I will never try stimulants again. Short, long acting, this one, that one, always seemed to end the same way. Have you been on any other stimulants before? 


I sure hope we are done now with constant adjustments... Just little adjustments! "
Clonidine has changed my son's life,Pretty much did the same thing about a month ago. 30 mg Vyvanse did less than Buproprion for me. 40 made me irritable but nothing else. I gave it a trial of the full duration till the follow-up. At that point i told the provider that I'd rather replace with nothing than keep taking it. On to the next med we went(so far going better than Vyvanse)
Clonidine has changed my son's life,There are lots of options these days. I started on methylfenidate and I would crash so hard I could barely keep my eyes open. Adderal was a game changer.
Clonidine has changed my son's life,That’s what my psychiatrist prescribed me. She started me on 40 mg 1xday.
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"That checks out with my experience on it. Im 33, ADHD and C-PTSD. A few years ago I started Clonidine and experienced my first real night of sleep in my entire life lmao. Did not realize how bad my sleep quality had been until the clonidine, and how much of my life was being impacted by low quality sleep because it had always been my normal."
Clonidine has changed my son's life,Have you seen any patterns between kids who work well on clonidine and whether or not they end up working well on certain types of stimulants or the shepherd other types of stimulants if they have to move to them later on?
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"Tics, not ticks. When I talk to patients about tics potentially worsening from stimulants, I joke that I mean the funny movements and not the little bugs, since they are homonyms."
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"My child has such severe ADHD that she was dx at 2. When she was 4, the first thing we did was put her on clonidine so she could sleep. 

She’d be up until 4, 5, 6 AM just going, going, going. She was exhausted but her body would not stop moving. 

It helped her but it saved MY life bc I could sleep, too. She’s 8 now and still on it."
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"yes! taking a stimulant with clonidine is considered a ‘two pronged approach’, so there’s something to keep you up and then something to help you sleep"
Clonidine has changed my son's life,Benadryl has never made me sleepy. When I was little it made me hyper. I think that's why I ended up on dimetapp for my allergies in childhood (70s & 80s) I was not diagnosed with ADHD until adulthood.
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"We also tried guanfacine, hoping for the same effects, both immediate and extended release. we personally saw zero effect or change in behavior with this medication, thus the switch to clonidine. It has been a journey!!!"
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"For Risperdal, there are risks of weight gain, pre-diabetes (aka metabolic syndrome), and prolactin elevation ( which can cause menstrual problems, lactation; or breast development in boys). I prescribe a lot, but I take it very seriously when I do. It can be very helpful for aggression, especially in autism. But I try to use it for more dangerous aggression ( hurting people, damaging property), and not mild mostly verbal aggression."
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"I took risperodone for a while and it was so effective, but I started getting the tongue thrusting and uncontrollable movements, so I had to stop it before those became permanent"
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"I believe the concern for boys was actually growing in the breast area and weight gain. And it could interfere with the reproduction system. But I’m no medical professional, so of course talk to your dr! Good luck!!"
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"10 medications…..I feel you!!  I feel so bad always changing on my 11 year old, but we still haven’t cracked the right one. And just when you think you are close, they go through a growth spurt or now puberty, so you almost have to start over! Augh. Appreciate hearing everyone’s journeys though."
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"Daaaamn i feel like this is the med for me. Apparently even used to treat heavy sweating which I have as well next to sleep problems, high blood pressure, insomnia and anxiety. 
But my shrink looked weird at me when I proposed it…"
Clonidine has changed my son's life,Sleep on clonidine is such a help.
Clonidine has changed my son's life,Are you still having success with it? Auto moderator deleted my original comment so I hope my question makes sense otherwise I’ll message you
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"I was about to correct you to say that they are homophones, not homonyms, because homophones are words that are spelled differently but sound the same. While that's true, it turns out that I had the definition of ""homonyms"" confused with the definition of ""homographs"", which are words that are spelled the same but sound different. Since ""homonyms"", as a category, encompasses both homophones and homographs, you were correct all along! 

Well, I'll post this anyway because I learned something, and maybe others will learn something too."
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"I was diagnosed with OCD since I did a lot of ""rituals"" and had pretty severe texture sensitivity (would throw a tantrum if my mom put clothes on me I didn't like the texture of, such as corduroy, denim, and even socks). Though, my mom thought I had ADHD and even my therapist did. But my doctor didn't for some reason so..meh? 

But funnily enough that's exactly how my mom described it. That I'd keep going, going, going even though she could tell I was exhausted but it was like I was fighting it. I'd be up until ungodly hours as well. And the clonidine was as helpful for her as it was for me lmao"
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"Hmmm, I may need this, as does my 12 yr old, perhaps. She's autistic and her sleep habits are awful. Me, I'll wait til I switch adhd meds first, concerta(sp?) doesn't seem to be working for me as it should. I also have terrible sleep habits, mostly insomnia lol. Concerta doesn't appear to make it worse but it certainly doesn't help it either."
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"Interesting, I knew that could happen with certain cold meds but not benadryl. My mom is like you are with benadryl when she uses nyquil. Nyquil doesn't make me sleepy, not hyper, it just exists. Ironically, my brother is allergic to benadryl, which is kinda funny given its function!🤣 maybe it's a 70s and 80s thing lol, my brothers and i were all 80s kids. It's funny how the body can be. I was diagnosed adhd in adulthood too, just a year ago, in fact. Now I know why caffeine does literally nothing for me, lol!"
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"I’m not very familiar with guanfacine as compared to risperidone, but I work in DD/psych and long term risperidone seems to have more extrapyramidal side effects like dyskinesia. Also constipation, which over years when they can’t tell you and it is thus probably under-treated, turns into megacolon. Which has its own problems. I second the advice to save risperidone for if other meds aren’t sufficient. Clonidone seems especially benign compared to more traditional psychotropics. 
Source: long-time nurse for DD adults with behavior problems, talking out my ass"
Clonidine has changed my son's life,We like the weight gain for one of my kids who struggles with eating on the ADHD meds.
Clonidine has changed my son's life,Can I asked how it was effective for you?  My oldest can't explain how it feels.  We see him pace less and he is less rambling but I wonder how it feels in his brain.  Like how my youngest told us the song goes silent when his Vyvanse kicks in.  It was eye opening to hear that he just had a constant loop going in his head and Vyvanse finally gave him that break.
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"Popping in to say that my doc recommended Clonidine for me because I’m right on the cusp of menopause (the awkward several years before, where you get all the fun symptoms of menopause but also still have to deal with irregular periods), which added terrible night sweating to my already prevalent anxiety-induced-insomnia that I’ve had all my life.

It works amazingly well!  I got the first goodnight’s sleep I’d had in so long that I didn’t remember — and since she wrote the script for me to take one at night and one during the day “as needed”, I searched to see how that would interact with my ADHD meds.  What stunned me is how many reviews I found that praised it as being so helpful when taken in addition to ADHD meds.  

If I take one during the day, it’s usually when I’m overwhelmed / overstimulated past what my ADHD meds can handle.  I can be in a full-blown panic attack, and if I take a clonidine, it chills me out within 20 minutes without any kind of weird drugged feeling like you would get with lorazepam or something like that.  I just suddenly feel like I can breathe again, and there’s a slightly sleepy feeling that’s not too hard to fight off if you need to continue working, but if you wanted to lay down you could. 

All this to say — if you have horrible night sweats like I did, and the anxiety-insomnia, definitely try it."
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"Yep! I started it early 2022 and have used it every night since. I did a very small dose increase about 2 months ago when I noticed my sleep quality had declined some again, but I started on .1mg and I’m at .15mg now so there’s still tons of wiggle room to keep increasing my dose as needed."
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"And comments like this are how you can tell this is an ADHD sub! Thanks for sharing, you've absolutely taught me something new 😊"
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"Had the same kneejerk reaction, was about to Google but you saved me the time!"
Clonidine has changed my son's life,It gave me that calm in my brain. Otherwise it was racing thoughts and really high anxiety and it just calmed it down so much. Volume down from like 100 to 5. Peaceful. But I wouldn’t take it again because of the side effects 😕
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"Thank you very much! That sounds really helpful. Currently i use zolpiclon or zolpidem to sleep but I‘ve got used to them. Have you ever tried them or is lorazepam similar? I feel like I need something that grounds me more than these things.

I hope you‘ll get over all of that and manage to find peaceful nights without meds. But till then it’s nice that it works!"
Clonidine has changed my son's life,What dosage are you using for night sweats?
Clonidine has changed my son's life,Thanks. I’m on the lowest dose (.1mg) and it seems to wake me up at night around 3am. I sleep pretty good without it but thinking I should ask my nurse about increasing to a higher dose because I do like that it puts me to sleep fast instead of tossing and turning with ruminating thoughts
Clonidine has changed my son's life,ADHD REDDIT post 100% 😂
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"But it’s a great rescue med. like if things are really out of control for a while, bringing it on temporarily to put out the fire so that you can work other things in to help"
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"I take 0.1 mg at night, nothing much but it really helps."
Clonidine has changed my son's life,That's what we did for my youngest.  Risperidone until we could titrate his Zoloft up and then took him off the Risperidone.
Clonidine has changed my son's life,Last night I took that amount but broken up over the night and it did nothing so I may just not be one of the chosen ones.
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"It took about 2 weeks or so to really build up in my system at first, to the point that now I can really tell if I haven’t taken it.  You may need to give it some time.  If you’ve already been on it for a few weeks, you may want to ask your doc about if they suggest a different dosage. Hoping it works for you!  Night sweats suck."
Clonidine has changed my son's life,Good to know! Do you think it's worth breaking it up? I tend to get worse flashes towards morning.
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"I tried breaking it up at the start, but then I couldn’t get to sleep at the beginning of the night.  I still do have some early mornings unfortunately, where I’m woken up about 5:30 - 6:00 am and then can’t get back to sleep for the last hour or so I should have gotten, but it’s mostly only when I’m a week out from what is scheduled to be my period (which is of course slightly erratic now that I’m in peri-menopause).  It’s worth a shot to try breaking it up, as sometimes people’s bodies react differently."
Clonidine has changed my son's life,Preach on that bad sleep right before the period! Thanks for all the information!
Clonidine has changed my son's life,"No problem, I hope you find some relief!"
Clonidine kinda slaps,"Clonidine can be used off label as a treatment for ADHD. It isn’t commonly prescribed, because guanfacine (Intuniv) is in the same drug class and approved for ADHD treatment.

Clonidine is shorter acting than Intuniv. When it is prescribed, it is usually prescribed to be taken at night. It lowers blood pressure and provides a somewhat sedative effect. Some people have difficulty winding down after using stimulants during the day to function. Clonidine in the evening can help this transition. 

Intuniv on the other hand is longer acting. It is useful for those who have impulsivity and hyperactivity as part of their ADHD symptoms. Taken at bedtime, it is designed to alleviate these issues in the same way clonidine does… and can provide relief from irritability, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. It is designed to last 24 hours but for some this can cause sedation during the daytime even when paired with stimulants. 

Clonidine can give some very bizarre dreams so for anyone who has PTSD, this class of medication might not be a good choice. 

Glad this is a good combination for you!"
Clonidine kinda slaps,"Paediatrician prescribed it for our 7yo right off the bat as a sleep aid. She said it’s not a sleeping pill, but it helps the mind wind down etc.     So naturally I’ve been taking it too!

Interestingly I’ve also just been reading that amongst other benefits, it can also be useful in treating symptoms of IBS (I write while lying here with a stomach ache)"
Clonidine kinda slaps,"Wait ok I def needed to hear this. I started taking  it today (bottle says take one in morning and one at night) for my ADHD/anxiety. I took one in the morning and was exhausted all day until I took a refreshing af nap (naps are usually rare and never refreshing for me, so that was nice). Woke up from it with dry mouth, but also lowered anxiety, a good mood, and peace/ silence in my brain. Also no weird dreams to speak of. I’m excited to take it again tonight because the Welbutrin I take for depression causes terrible insomnia, and sometimes a touch of paranoia.

However, I know I can’t be dealing with Clonidine’s drowsiness during the day every day, I have work. But during the day is when I need ADHD medication the most, and so far Clonidine is the only med that has helped with my racing thoughts. How long would you say the ADHD effects extend into the morning after taking it at night? Clonidine was prescribed to me after trying many different ADHD meds that didn’t work out."
Clonidine kinda slaps,Has anyone experienced weight gain with Clonidine? I just started it
Clonidine kinda slaps,"I couldn’t believe the difference when I added this med to the list! Definitely experiencing fatigue and dry mouth/dehydration, but I will start taking it at night as recommended. This thread is very helpful!"

Clonidine kinda slaps,"That’s weird about the bizarre dreams, as I was given it by my psych for ptsd nightmares! Loads of studies on how clonidine helps ptsd nightmares"
Clonidine kinda slaps,Thanks for adding this extra information for everyone ❤️
Clonidine kinda slaps,"Has it helped?

I have a child with severe sleep issues, and my doctor has just prescribed it. We’re really hopeful that it will help."
Clonidine kinda slaps,"I did have a weird sleep thing happen where I had this urgent need to take my very comfy, light shirt off while I was sleeping *shrugs*. I was like 75% asleep (my eyes were open and I remember it) during this quick event. Not typical behavior for me as I keep my PJs on every night and don't wake up with my shirt on the ground. Dry mouth? Take one Xylimelt before bed, one while you sleep, and after a glass of water and brushing teeth in morning swish Smart Mouth Dry Mouth mouth wash. So yeah sleep stripping and dry mouth and metallic taste in mouth which is a zinc depletion on your taste buds (basically) so the mouth wash helps with that. .1 mg didn't make me sleepy."
Clonidine kinda slaps,"If it is making you drowsy during the day, try taking a half dose in the morning and the full dose at night."
Clonidine kinda slaps,I’m currently getting prescription for this as well! Hope it helps with the restlessness
Clonidine kinda slaps,any updates? I'm taking my first dose tonight haha.
Clonidine kinda slaps,lol yeah its kinda weird how much drugs can very between people. interestingly it can treat nightmares in people who DO HAVE nightmares. but can cause different/strange dreams for people who DONT have nightmares...
Clonidine kinda slaps,"The first night I took Clonidine .1mg, I woke up with my hand clutching my neck pretty firmly because I was dreaming that I got gum stuck in my throat and I just kept pulling and pulling it out but the gum was stuck in my throat. I did not take a xylimelt before bed as I wasn't sure that I would get dry mouth as a symptom but boy did I ever get dry mouth and metallic taste in my mouth and my tongue feeling like the precursor to my throat swelling up. But I'm wondering if it's just my taste receptors feeling weird like they are burnt. It is spring so I've been taking an allergy pill. Once in my life my throat temporarily was swollen but went down on its own. So I was wondering if I was allergic to the cornstarch (inactive ingredient) in the Clonidine. I'm thinking the tongue thing has more to do with the metallic taste. I read that the medication affects the zinc in your body. Smart Mouth dry mouth which ""activates zinc ions"" is what I will take as soon as I wake up every morning. Wish me luck."
Clonidine kinda slaps,"Absolutely.  It’s been great.  We find the clonidine crushed fine into a little milk with a couple of drops of melatonin (equalling about 0.2mg melatonin) about 40 mins before bed has bed time so much easier.  

The first week she really noticed her eyes getting heavy before she was ready to wind down. Which she complained a little about. But looking back after several months of it - she wasn’t ready to wind down because every day and night was a struggle for her. So adrenaline was on and winding down was hard!

With constant use bed times are now - dare I say it - kind of pleasant now!  A bit of wrangling to get her teeth etc done to actually get into bed. But then I read to her, we chat a bit then lights out and after 10 minutes she’s usually out.   The whole process can still take 40-60 minutes. But it’s more relaxed now. Instead of 2 hours of stress!"
Clonidine kinda slaps,"It works great for me! I take 2/night now!!

ETA: 2 works for me, but I’m also 230lbs. 1 is probably perfect for most."
Clonidine kinda slaps,"We tried for the first time last night & my son woke up at 2:30 am and stayed awake until 7am 😂

We’ve had the same problem with melatonin in the past, but we’re going to keep trying and hope it eventually helps!"
Clonidine kinda slaps,Sorry for the bump-- No dry mouth or headaches?
Clonidine kinda slaps,"Ha yeah. Had that happen so many times!  

First thing to check is the melatonin dose. Most are way overdosed and can cause a paradoxical reaction like that where they wake in the night. 

Secondly, this happened to us a lot when she was chronically overtired.  We had an excellent sleep therapist when she was really small and she showed us graphs of “awake” hormones like adrenaline and serotonin and where they naturally peak and wane in the day-night cycle and the relation to sleep. 

When they are overtired (which is most of the time for adhd kids and others!) the awake hormones kick into a higher gear because the signal from the body is that they are in danger!  Like in cave times ;).  So the signal is “be prepared”.   Which of course keeps them awake! Making it worse over time. 

Then we are at them saying “you need to go to sleep!!”  

Then when they finally pass out from exhaustion the hormones don’t get flushed out immediately.   So they are light sleeping until the body says “ok that’s just enough for me to be prepared for the danger again” and they wake up….at 4am!
 The cycle goes around and around. 

So the trick is stick with the clonidine etc and consistently get them in bed *before* they get tired. Nice and early.  Before the hormones ramp up even further. 

Over time it becomes less of a fight."
Clonidine kinda slaps, Very dry mouth but I just drink more water and I’m used to the dry mouth from years on adderall. I haven’t noticed headaches at all though.
Clonidine kinda slaps,"Thank you so much! Yes, he’s so beyond sleep deprived right now, it’s not even funny. While I know that’s likely being chronically over tired, it’s really helpful to hear from someone else! We’re sticking with it, and are working on getting him in bed really early - before his stress hormones spike again! 

I’m hoping we’re through it soon. It does feel like a tremendous relief to be trying something and seeing an effect after years of thinking we had no options.

Thanks again! It’s not something many people write about, so it’s pretty isolating. It’s helpful to know other folks have been there!"
Clonidine kinda slaps,"I’m very happy I could help in any way. And you are absolutely right, it’s very isolating and there’s very little written about it. 

I remember googling like a hundred times and only getting articles about bouncing babies back to sleep!  So frustrating, and so damaging to your mental health!

We are finally starting to relax around bedtime and feeling ok to not creep around silently!

If you stick with it, you will get quick relief, but don’t get fooled! It’s important to stick with all those things for … well maybe years? I’m not sure.  But I know that every now and then we think “what’s the harm?” And let her stay up late for a bit.  While it’s not as drastic as it used to be, we still pay for it!

Glad you’re on the path now! Good luck."
Clonidine kinda slaps,"Ah, you’re so wonderful! 

We’re on day 4 now and the improvement is so dramatic. My son has been getting 11 hours of sleep instead of 8.5-9, and he asked to go play outside today and to go on an outing for the first time in months. 

My husband and I were really emotional about it, because he’s been so exhausted for so long he had no interest in going outside or going anywhere with us.

It’s a small thing that’s also a huge thing.

Thanks again!"
Clonidine kinda slaps,"Aww that's fantastic! That is a HUGE thing - we totally understand :)

For us there was a few milestones like that: playing by herself for 20 minutes! Being quiet for a while - usually non-stop talking!  Shrugging off something small that would normally irritate or derail her.

Congratulations! Onwards and upwards!"

Anyone with positive experience with Clonidine for ADHD ?,"Clonidine works really well (when it does work) for emotional control and working memory.

I've also found that I don't feel ""stressed"" for no reason or flight/fighty. It's definitely toned my baseline down to a manageable level.

It does help focus too. It seems to help me focus because I'm calm.

My psychiatrist said she has people on it and they ended up stopping their stimulant medications because it was so effective."
Anyone with positive experience with Clonidine for ADHD ?,I’m starting this soon. Did anyone notice the dulling  or reductions of highs / energy bursts / creativity etc? Namely at work?
Anyone with positive experience with Clonidine for ADHD ?,"I take Clonidine for sleep. I also have ADHD and take Concerta for that, but I only take Clonidine at night. It has been a fucking miracle for my sleep issues. Like I’ve had insomnia since I was a very young kid and this is the only thing that has ever worked and not fucked the rest of my life up.

As for use during the day, I have no idea. It just makes me sleepy, which is what I need."
Anyone with positive experience with Clonidine for ADHD ?,Uhhh I take that medication for sleep
Anyone with positive experience with Clonidine for ADHD ?,"I take vortioxetine 15mg, Clonidine 350mcg and coincidentally started today on Atomoxetine 40mg. I’m either feeling a powerful placebo or day 1 effects from Atomoxetine which I did not expect. I was able to do double the workout I would usually do and my mood was euphoric all day. I am hoping it is not a hypomanic response (I am susceptible to SSRI-induced hypomania, but I have complex diagnoses being ASD, ADHD and Borderline Personality Disorder).

The theory of my psychiatrist is that vortioxetine has cognitive enhancing effects due to 5-HT3, and perhaps 5-HT7 antagonism, and clonidine too with its alpha-2a agonism. Atomoxetine might be the final straw to increase dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex and provide the kick needed to lift off for ADHD without anxiety.

I found that Clonidine so far has not helped my ADHD to a significant extent, though perhaps it has effects on some impulsivity and memory enhancement.

I had great success with Guanfacine XR 6mg in the past on ADHD, though it had intolerable side effects (incredibly light sleep, middle insomnia, misophonia at night, severe social inhibition, lack of sense of emotional expression, humour and wits, severe irritability).

It however gave me incredible impulsive control and ability to plan and organise (healthiest diet ever, would plan out 15 minutes in sunshine everyday, almost OCD levels of  behaviour like hand washing, brushing teeth, doing the dishes), anticipation of future reward from such tasks, impressive working and long term memory enhancement and recall (such as automatically remembering dates and finding mnemonic studying extremely easy), huge work ethic (I’m talking 16 hour assignment and study days).

The success of Intuniv at such a high dose gives me hope that there is effective ADHD treatment possible for me, and I wish I had tried it with an antidepressant. However, I will provide an update after 1-2 months of Atomoxetine use in combination with clonidine (and vortioxetine) and see where this combination takes me."
Anyone with positive experience with Clonidine for ADHD ?,"I'm being tapered off Guanfacine over the next two weeks to go on Clonidine. Does anybody know about this or how long it will take the Clonidine to work? I also take Focalin XR 25 mg, Belsomra 15 mg,Seroquel 25 mg X2, and Gabapentin 600 mg X3 among other meds. Is this potent?"
Anyone with positive experience with Clonidine for ADHD ?,"Gaunfinacin, I started and was confident how great it would be, having good results. As my dose upped however it cancelled our my solfinacin (for frequent urination.)

I know that's super random, but this obviously won't be an issue for most people, so definitely worth a try 

I switched back to Clonidine after about six years a month ago. It's fine so far, and in the same family- but I just think guanfinacin would've been better if peeing every five minds wasn't such an issue"
Anyone with positive experience with Clonidine for ADHD ?,"Wow great to hear!

Would you know how it compares to guanfacine?"
Anyone with positive experience with Clonidine for ADHD ?,"I honesty feel this is what I need from a medication, I need to feel calm and not stress about so many things to actually focus on one thing, the stimulant is a bonus."
Anyone with positive experience with Clonidine for ADHD ?,Do you have an update of how it's worked for you?
Anyone with positive experience with Clonidine for ADHD ?,"I'm on week 2, just went up to 0.2mg (0.1 twice daily). Yes reduction of highs and energy bursts, but I'm considering the possibility that this is a good thing! My stimulant (a formulation of Focalin) kinda forced my emotions and I would feel kinda drained after. Adding on Kapvay has kinda leveled everything out, and I'm hoping that as I adjust I'll learn to focus on my emotions with them being more subtle. Also the physical overstimulation issues I had are disappearing, and my brain has been more quiet than ever 😃

For context the way I process norepinephrine is a little weird. I think I have a genetic mutation that causes norepinephrine to accumulate (COMT Met/Met) and that also pushes my cardiovascular system a bit too much. I tried Intuniv (guanfacine) for a month first and immediately felt benefits due to the ""blood pressure"" (norepinephrine-reducing) effects - the same effects that most people hate! However, you build tolerance to those effects, and when that happened I actually felt stoned for about a week before I started titrating off.

I think you have to wait a few weeks for your body and brain to adjust before you make a final decision. I'm wondering if Kapvay will kinda create a roof for stimulation: it first mellows everything out, then your body returns to baseline but doesn't cross the line that Kapvay sets. Focalin actually relaxes me for the first few days and then becomes a bit overstimulating, so if it normalizes to where the Focalin stays consistent I can see it being perfect!!"
Anyone with positive experience with Clonidine for ADHD ?,So my psychiatrist prescribed clonidine for my random anxiety attacks. I was taking beta blockers but they weren’t helping with my anxiety. She told me to take this as needed and I was hoping it would help w my sleep cause I have insomnia too but I’m reading that it needs to be taken daily similar to an ssri so I’m very confused what this medicine is. I also took it for the first time hoping it would relax me and it’s done the opposite I feel on edge. Do you take yours everyday?
Anyone with positive experience with Clonidine for ADHD ?,"Can I ask what dose you take?

I am on .1mg, though it only just feels like it helps sometimes. May ask Dr if I can increase of what other options there are.

I write this at 2am after taking clonidine and melatonin hours ago.."
Anyone with positive experience with Clonidine for ADHD ?,"Thanks for sharing. 

Do you get any other positive benefits?"
Anyone with positive experience with Clonidine for ADHD ?,Do you take it as needed or on a schedule?
Anyone with positive experience with Clonidine for ADHD ?,"Guanfacine sounds incredible, shame about the side effects.

I'm looking to improve my working memory, long term memory and recall. Maybe Guanfacine might work for me."
Anyone with positive experience with Clonidine for ADHD ?,"Hi, thanks for sharing about clonidine and guanfacine.

Please update us in 1-2 months of Atomoxetine use."
Anyone with positive experience with Clonidine for ADHD ?,"I'm looking forward to your update, the positives you noticed with Intuniv is exactly what I'm looking for."
Anyone with positive experience with Clonidine for ADHD ?,Any update?
Anyone with positive experience with Clonidine for ADHD ?,"Bump for others to comment on. I'm interested to know too. I haven't tried guanfacine or clonidine.

May I ask why you are changing from guanfacine to clonidine, Did the guanfacine not work for you?


Please report back in a few weeks on your experience."
Anyone with positive experience with Clonidine for ADHD ?,"I just got prescribed clonidine yesterday. My doctor mentioned that it isn't the type of dx that needs to build up in your system, so you should see results pretty quickly. I plan on taking my first dose tonight."
Anyone with positive experience with Clonidine for ADHD ?,Any update?
Anyone with positive experience with Clonidine for ADHD ?,I've never used guanfacine sorry
Anyone with positive experience with Clonidine for ADHD ?,">However, you build tolerance to those effects, and when that happened I actually felt stoned for about a week before I started titrating off

Hi, I'm considering Guanfacine or Clonidine but could you explain this a bit more? didn't you feel to increase the dose and stay on it? I'm wondering why you ""titrated off"" of it."
Anyone with positive experience with Clonidine for ADHD ?,"Huh, that’s weird. I take it most nights but my psych never said anything about taking it every day, she recommended NOT taking it every night actually. I’m sorry it put you on edge though!"
Anyone with positive experience with Clonidine for ADHD ?,"Nightmare relief as well and at the lowest dose, I can take it for anxiety during the day!:)"
Anyone with positive experience with Clonidine for ADHD ?,every night
Anyone with positive experience with Clonidine for ADHD ?,"It’s certainly effective for that, I think give it a shot. Most people seem to respond at much lower dosages, particularly if you take a stimulant"
Anyone with positive experience with Clonidine for ADHD ?,"I am changing because after taking Guanfacine for 2 years, it wasn't touching my symptoms anymore. My doctor said Clonidine is more potent than Guanfacine (and there is Kapvay brand name for Clonidine ER)."
Anyone with positive experience with Clonidine for ADHD ?,How did it go?  😊
Anyone with positive experience with Clonidine for ADHD ?,"I started a few months ago and it was life-changing, day 1. The noise of stress and dysregulation was dramatically reduced upon waking after the first dose, and I continue to improve. It's been great for me."
Anyone with positive experience with Clonidine for ADHD ?,"Hi, I have a few more questions, 

May I ask what dose of clonidine you take?

Do you take it once at night ?

And do you take the immediate release or extended release?"
Anyone with positive experience with Clonidine for ADHD ?,"I got it for sleep after the psychiatrist  who specializes in sleep ran out of antidepressants and sleep meds for me to try. It’s been a hell of a few months, 8 rx later the doc had an epiphany that I was add (I’m adhd, whatever). I told her this on my first visit and she told me there was no way I could be so professionally and academically accomplished, be 55 and adhd. Whatever. She gave me clonodine after I refused an other antidepressants last week. I was afraid to take it with 7 am meetings the next day (other solutions turned me into a zombie or just didn’t work). I took it with 4 mg of melatonin and for the first time I ever remember understood the concept of drifting off to sleep. Day 1. I’m on day 4 and optimistic though I’ll say there have been a lot of tears wondering why no one caught this earlier. It takes much longer to work (like 2 hrs vs 30 min according to the doc) than described but it works. I lived for 15 yrs taking ambien because it was the only predictable way I could sleep. 

I’ve been to so many specialists and no one would listen to the adhd idea until a nurse and I talked about it. 

I’m now trying to disentangle what’s adhd, decades of disordered sleep and just me. Yes you get depressed from lack of sleep. Have insomnia long enough and you’ll definitely end up anxious because it’s hard to function never knowing how much sleep you’ll get."
Anyone with positive experience with Clonidine for ADHD ?,"I take 0.1mg 3x a day and 0.175mg before bed.

Please don't mimic my dose schedule. Clonidine is quite potent, especially when first starting. It needs to be titrated up and also down (if needing to reduce).

If you come off it without titration you risk really high blood pressure and you'll feel terrible.

Some people have been hospitalised for coming off it too quickly."
Anyone with positive experience with Clonidine for ADHD ?,"Ok, got it. 

Thanks for sharing"
To Clonidine or not to Clonidine,Clonidine has worked really well for me. It really helps with my anxiety and helps me sleep. It doesn’t have any crazy side effects
To Clonidine or not to Clonidine,"Thumbs up from me, based on my experience with it."
To Clonidine or not to Clonidine,Oh wow - I did t know this could help adhd! I was prescribed for anxiety.
To Clonidine or not to Clonidine,"No experience with clonidine. But I know it is officially indicated as second-line/adjunct treatment for ADHD in many places. Sedation is a (side) effect for all three drugs: clonidine, trazodone and lorazepam. Especially trazodone. So it makes sense to try to cut down the number of different medications taken which will make you feel drowsy. 

Also these medications can interact (check CYP2D6), so things like serotonin syndrome might be a real concern and possibility, depending on dosages.

I say go with your doc's recommendations. Then take it from there."

To Clonidine or not to Clonidine,It relaxes me and is great for getting to sleep.
To Clonidine or not to Clonidine,[deleted]
To Clonidine or not to Clonidine,"Ah yes, the stantons. Just be careful when you stop taking it, you need to slowly ween off and tritate. You risk killing yourself if you immediately stop"
To Clonidine or not to Clonidine,I was on Effexor first and then Dexedrine. The two really didn't play nicely together. I imagine that's because both the Effexor and Dex were playing with my Norepinephrine and making me feel really uneasy. Ditching the Effexor alleviated most of this but now OCD tendencies are popping up for the first time.
To Clonidine or not to Clonidine,yeah i'll give it another go thanks
To Clonidine or not to Clonidine,Whats your dosage if I may ask?
To Clonidine or not to Clonidine,thank you the two comments gave me a positive vibe from it so i'm giving it another try tonight but i hope i don't get nauseated though...
To Clonidine or not to Clonidine,[removed]
To Clonidine or not to Clonidine,yeah again it didn't work i tried it for a whole week this time but no ...the feeling i have from it is just terrible ....she might have me try something else
To Clonidine or not to Clonidine,"Ah no, not the stantons. Statins. And clonidine is not a statin. But you are correct that stopping clonidine abruptly can lead to serious rebound high blood pressure. Though it probably won't kill you."
To Clonidine or not to Clonidine,how would i risk killing myself ? i just stopped one day to the next and the first time too
To Clonidine or not to Clonidine,Did you replace Effexor with something else?
To Clonidine or not to Clonidine,Just make sure they start you out on the smallest dose. That’s what my NP did for me.
To Clonidine or not to Clonidine,.01 mg
To Clonidine or not to Clonidine,Do you have link to these reviews? My doctor suggested taking it for Adderall-induced weight gain (stim induced hunger at night results in insomnia). So would like to see what people are saying about this.
To Clonidine or not to Clonidine,Thank you for correcting me
To Clonidine or not to Clonidine,Reason is rebound hypertension (high blood pressure) if you don't taper. Killing yourself is probably an exaggeration.
To Clonidine or not to Clonidine,well most stantons are blood thinners. if your body is use to that immediately stopping any stantons could drastically affect your blood pressure and give you a heart attack

Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,I’m so sorry you had that experience. That dr needs to stay in his lane! You’re right to find a new dr.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"If there's a way to report him I hope you do it, my childhood was twisted by these kinds of charlatans."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"My sleep doctor basically said that ADHD was caused by poor sleep and that fixing your sleep would correct ADHD.

She said this in the most ADHD-affected voice possible. Word vomit, bouncing through topics, etc. Like ok, yeah, you were just like me and now you're better."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"I can tell you I sleep a lot better now that I take ""speed"""
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"You should tell the doctor to read a fucking book. The book is called the DSM-5. Tell him he can make diagnoses once he has a psychiatric or psychological degree, otherwise he should stick to sleep studies. He has no authority to change your medications, you should get you your goddamn CPAP so you can get a good night's sleep. Either way, with a good apnea machine ADHD symptoms will improve."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,He is a sleep “doctor” because he slept through “med” school.

Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,As someone who taken both speed and prescribed medicine for ADHD I can assure you it’s not the same.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,Specialized doctors often have the most batshit takes for things outside of their specialization. They try to apply reason from what they know to everything.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"your Sleepdoctor is not real, he just uses it as an excuse to steel your money. Seriously?! Find a real doctor!"
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,">I do have a valid disorder despite there being “no real tests”.

Most conditions started out like this. One of my favorite examples is MS. They thought people were possessed, deranged, faking, whatever...until CT was invented. Then their brains lit up light Christmas lights. Now think of how legitimately it's treated.

My biggest one is myalgic encephalomyelitis (previously and poorly referred to as chronic fatigue syndrome). My imaging, bloodwork, and vital signs are relatively normal. It often gets dismissed being a little tired and/or a mental health thing. But if you have me do a CPET, you'll find that my heart and lung functioning puts me in the same category as someone with end stage heart failure. 

Anyway...even if there are ""no real tests,"" (spoiler: there are!) that doesn't mean it's not real. It just means we haven't figured out how to test for it yet."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"What a jerk! I had a dentist tell me that my hysterectomy was unnecessary. (Spoiler alert: yes, it was incredibly necessary) Someone needs to tell that idiot to stay in his lane. I wonder if a report to the medical board would be appropriate?

Your report on that other doctor didn’t “go nowhere”, it just wasn’t enough for them to take the very public action of revoking the medical license."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"ironically my ""speed"" makes me incredibly tired, I can only stay up for like 7 hours without feeling like knocking out again. i guess that's how speed effects everyone. im sorry you had to deal with such an uninformed and out of line doctor"
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,A sleep specialist shouldn't be speaking about a neurological condition. He's not a specialist on psychiatry. I'm sorry you had that experience
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,Tell him his medical license isn’t real then
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"This guy sounds like a twat. Really.

  
BUT push to get the CPAP machine if it's needed. If you have sleep apnea it's likely exacerbating your ADHD symptoms, potentially severely. You might even be lucky enough to not need meds - though of course that would need to be discussed with you psychiatrist. Don't give up on the investigation, perhaps just go find a better sleep doctor."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Fuck that doctor, he is probably antivax and thinks the moon landing was staged."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"My sleep Dr tried to take me off an anti depressant and my psychiatrist told him to go fuck himself (in professional Dr language of course). 


Get your sleep study done. If you need it, you'll get a CPAP machine and that will change your life. You'll sleep better and your Vyvanse will be even more effective. 


Don't let his weird bullshit get in the way. Sleep is his specialty, let him handle it, instead of paying for a second dr to just tell you you need a sleep study. "

Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Absolutely report this doctor 

This could cause major harm to someone who’s already in a vulnerable position

Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"There _is_ actually research suggesting that insomnia can cause ADHD symptoms, but also that ADHD can cause insomnia.

Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"""Sleep isn't real and is just an excuse to lay around instead of working"" :P

tbh that's pretty rich coming from someone who supposedly specializes in sleep, aka one of the least well-understood things that people do and one of the areas where if you have a problem that will absolutely destroy your life, you might walk away with such earth-shaking advice as ""try being a bit less stressed about how this is ruining your life"""

Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"I once had a dental hygienist spend 10 minutes of my 30 minute appointment telling me what she recons about ADHD, I was not happy."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"People are generally misguided about ADHD, but i think the doc has a few points. Compared to something like Down's syndrome which has a very clear cause and definition, ADHD is pretty vague, right? Like this one part of the brain is supposedly smaller but even that can't be used in a diagnostic sense? It really is a collection of symptoms, and which things we consider symptoms or not, whether we tell someone to live with something or consider adjustments with meds or therapy, it is all a completely man made construct.

And while for 10 years ritalin made me awake, it makes me sleepy now. Stuff is very undefined and prone to change like that.

So while the doc may be wrong in having an extremist opinion and looking at the world through this single, narrow frame of reference, he is also a specialist of some kind, and i think it helps to remember that in some cases he'll be right. For example, everyone who is struggling with something, will as a consequence of getting a diagnosis, be able to forgive themselves for some of their failings. It is absolutely a thing that after getting a diagnosis people will drop their demands on themselves too much, find too much comfort in forgiving themselves, and start blaming unrelated issues on their diagnosis.

You don't need to take such advice enough to drop the meds and copes you have learned work for you, but it is always a good thing to stay critical of them and keep testing yourself.

It's like all these depressed people being sick and tired of hearing they need to go for walks in nature, but when they finally get out of depression, they will start rattling off the same thing. Walks aren't a cure for depression, and ppl are mistaken to sell it that way. But it is absolutely part of developing routine/discipline/health/etc that is necessary to break out of depression, so while it is wrong advice it should still be taken.

Our meds really are dangerous drugs, sometimes we are to blame but shift blame to our diagnosis, and it's good to remind ourselves occasionally"
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"I have ADHD, Sleep Apnea and GERD. Your doctor sucks. First find a new doctor. Second, leave a review about that doctor on Google. Make sure you get a pulmonologist to do a sleep study. ADHD  can cause sleep apnea to be more complicated. In my case, I have two sleep conditions. Sleep apnea and delayed sleep syndrome. To help me get to sleep on time and wake up on time I take 10 mg of melatonin 4 hours before bed. Solved my issues. Plus I use my CPAP."

Doctors are also just humans and he seems to be carry also a very strong weight. ;) Btw Ritalin gets often used in this medical field to treat e.g. ""narkolepsie"". So beside missing analytical deepness of his argumentation, there seems to be a lot about his personal opinion. 
I am waiting for my evaluation and I started to test oeoples reaction (with people who are not that close,  so it wont hurt me too much, hello rsd) and its interesting how the topic sonetimes leads directly to the medication discussion, dont you think? ;) 
My oberservation is that no matter how little there knowledge about it is, everyone knows its medicated with Ritalin and some have a strong opinion about that. :) Funfact: I sometimes even had a bit the feeling it was denied especially by people which could also be similar tribe. :)) 
What I learned definitly with it, that you can not look into peoples head and maybe there is more behind it than you see.

As you wrote, important for yourself is that you look for a doctor who supports you and does make you feel comfortable, has understanding and helps you treat your sleep issues as a symptom of your ADHD.

I wish you the power to stand up for yourself and a better doctor ;)

Take care"

Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"How sad we can’t report doctors for spewing blatantly false information that has been proven for decades. Maybe he should read the THOUSANDS of books and peer-reviewed research saying ADHD is verifiably real, not the few that say it’s not. You should ask him for a research journal link to a peer-reviewed study, not a book. 

Good thing this guy is a sleep doctor and not a psychiatrist. Many doctors don’t know shit about other medical fields they’re not specialized in. 

Did you know that you don’t have to take a SINGLE nutrition or dietary course in med school to become a doctor? You know, the literal main thing we intake into our bodies that fuels us and causes all sorts of issues."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,I had a doctor try to tell me that my insomnia was the result of my ADHD meds that Ive been on since 22 when I’ve quite literally had insomnia since 12 at minimum
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,Sounds like his doctor title isn’t real either
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"""Sleep Doctors arent real and an excuse to take my money"""
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,It's funny to me that they think it's like speed. I was once a speed addict about 10-15 years ago. I've now been on Vyvanse for the last 6 months and this past weekend I took a nap an hour after taking it lol
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,Find another doctor and report this one 😬
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Wow! If that doctor is so behind on ADHD information I wonder how far behind he is regarding sleep. 

He is woefully ignorant."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Just you wait, I've had a psychiatrist talk exactly like this.. I was a mute the entire session.

It's a learning experience because you understand doctors can be idiots too."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"That’s ironic as heck because we sometimes use psychostimulants (the same stuff used for ADHD) for management of narcolepsy - a sleep/wake disorder. 

(I do research in sleep medicine/science. I also have ADHD.)

I’m so sorry you had this experience, and yes, please find a new sleep doctor. Bro needs to stay in his own bloody lane."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"I don’t think I’d have made it to the end without telling them to shut the fuck up and do their job before I start giving people unsolicited sleep clinic expertise I’m not qualified to open my mouth about.

I’m absolutely sick of people like this riding the stigma train as much as I’m sick of influencers or entrepreneurs bullshitting to profit off us.

Also just to make sure they potentially make less money out of you. Make sure you check whether you’re a candidate for UPPP surgery with an ENT before buying a cpap machine and all the other crap from this sleep clinic. Permanent solution > bandaid air pump."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,Forget everything he said. He's wrong. Get new dr.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"That ""doctor"" shouldn't be a doctor anymore. It's like telling a person with internal bleeding that blood isn't real."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,">Will probably find a different doctor...

Hopefully you can find a real one instead of this hack job.

Mine repeatedly tried to claim my 35+ year struggle with sleep onset was caused by the Ritalin I had been taking for only 2 years. My responses got less patient over time, he seems to have dropped it finally but the response I have lined up is about why he's pimping CPAP machines instead of collecting a Nobel prize for discovering time travel."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"That doc needs to update their knowledge.

Ignore and proceed with your psychiatrist."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"It’s a good thing he doesn’t diagnose adhd then 🙄 stay in your lane!

For me though, what was reassuring to me to confirm my diagnosis was that when I first taking 5mg of adderall, I was falling asleep as though I took a Benadryl. I don’t get the wired feeling others without adhd would get if they took adderall."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Sounds like a psychologist,/therapist I went to.  He was adamant that he would cure my ADHD or give me my money back.  He would sign a contract that I can sue him if he didn't.  He even drove the point home by holding up his book.  I ghosted him after 3 sessions, because his one trick was to get me to speak off the top of my head in a stream of consciousness, because ""I'd eventually get to what was bothering me*.  After 50 minutes the only thing he said all session was, ""See you next week"".

He is a fucking quack and everyone in the community says as much."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”," That person was educated someplace in the south.I'd guess, alabama. He's ignorant shellfish self center, only his opinion counts.Tell him to go to helen wait.

Go get yourself a new doctor I invented my sleep medication. Most of the time it works good, but I gotta go to bed earlier than eleven o'clock.

I take my pills at 8 o'clock and I take my teeth out and I drink a big mug of homemade hot chocolate. My own recipe with 2% milk and within an hour, maybe 9 o'clock. My eyes are closing and i'm falling over at my desk.So I stumble off to bed and get six hours over dream of sleep.

But I can't tell you how to do it, because Reddit censors me. They tell me that my posts are removed when I talk about a certain thing. I can't even use the word, but they won't define the word to me. All they want to do is censure, me banish me, but they never define what's wrong. They never give me any feedback and I'm writing this for them. This is for you. Reddit"
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Oooh! I was told that too! I was also told by another doctor that I was too old to have ADHD, and too young for anxiety and depression. I'll let you imagine how that went... 2 years and a good dozen of doctors later, I'm glad it's over and taken care of, at least for now. Yay meds and therapy!

Yes, it was a waste of time and money. Just raise your head and look ahead to when you'll be able to discuss it in details with a doctor who cares."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,I’ve had better sleeps after taking aderall than I did before.  Like at the end of the day I’m not completely restless.  Unless i take it too late then I can’t sleep
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"this is apalling. any sleep doctor capable of diagnosing narcolepsy yet discredits ADHD needs to go back to school, since they missed something significant about brain size and development of current generations. Sorry you went through this"
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Sure and im sure he'd say that being depressed is just feeling sad. What a bunch of bs lol.

Omg we are such addicts that when we do ""speed"" all we do is wash the dishes or finally pay attention in class!! We need to be stopped! Wont someone think of the children!!!! /

You have my permissin tobliterally dismiss every single thing that comes out of this persons mouth"
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,Says a ‘Sleep Doctor’
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"... except ""speed"" have a different effect on people depending on if they have ADHD.

It's stimulating for people who don't have it and calming for people who do.

It's an observable effect. Your doctor is just in denial."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"That’s outside his scope of practice and he shouldn’t comment on it. Anyways that’s what I’ve told docs in the past when they make comments on it. If you’re not a psychologist or psych, you shouldn’t be trying to diagnose it and I don’t wanna hear about it"
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Sorry this happened to you. I once had a psychiatrist tell me autism was caused by vaccines. Both my kids are autistic. I really don't understand how these people keep their medical licenses, since there is so much research supporting the opposite of what they say.
You could report him to the board of medicine in your state for not following current practice, if you wanted."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"I mean, it is a good excuse to take speed? 

There has to be some benefits!! 

Don't let people put you down, it's crazy how many people are uneducated. I feel like ADHD is 20 years behind autism in people's understanding, even from professionals"
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,My Dr who prescribed me adderal said I was lazy. Cause I’m American. I started recording our sessions. I told him I was too. I hate him but he’s convenient
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,ritaline helps me sleep go figure
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Ah yes, an ""Expert"" who has specialized so much that he can't see anything else.

It is true that sleep apnea/sleep deprivation, can mimic the symptoms of ADHD, and it's also thought that 1/3 of people with ADHD have sleep apnea as well.

Neither of those things stop ADHD from being real and me having it (and sleep apnea)"
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"i am SO furious for you. i don’t know if reporting them would make you feel better, but their behavior is inexcusable and so harmful. what an absolute turd. 

adhd is so often comorbid with other things, none of which makes the adhd itself less valid. it just simply means if you have one other things could also be possible. this is basic stuff, so that doctor is either super behind on research or perhaps more likely incredibly biased by personal beliefs. i also suffer from severe sleep issues and i would never wish that on anyone. i hope you can find an empathetic doctor who will listen and not be horribly dismissive. 

tldr: it’s not you, he sucks"
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Literally all diseases and disorders are a series of symptoms, thats how diagnostic criteria work."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,Report him
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Do you smell that?

Smells like medical malpractice."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,She’s got you figured out sometimes the truth is a slap in the face jk
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,This coming from the doctor who prescribes expensive treatment for snoring.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,Report this guy
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,Fuck that guy. Vyvanse is a life saver for me. On it 6 years so far and without it I can promise you I would not be where I am today.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,You know what go buy your CPAP from somebody else. Tell him you can fuck off
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Oh... Unfortunately I am just enough of a loud mouth that I would have shut him down in the first 30 seconds, ripped him a new one and stormed out.

Please, please report this moron to whoever needs to be notified."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,Im so sorry u had that kind of idiot :( you deserve real doctor...go psychiatrist. Powerhug->🤗
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,That doctor needs reported!
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Not only should you get a new doctor, you need to report him to the organization he works for as well as whatever licensing board is over your jurisdiction."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,IT would have been so satisfying to make a comment about how sorry doctors aren’t real doctors anyways….
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"don’t take it to heart, just as how you wouldn’t take to heart a psychiatrist telling you sleep apnea is a a fake disorder. This is why they always suggest you get second and third opinions from other professionals :)

On a serious note though, do address the sleep apnea and do try the sleep study as sleep apnea can cause a slew of health issues including the worsening of health issues. Addressing it might also help result in the need of less meds for the same benefit."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,Use the app Done. And thank me later. $80/month for the continued prescription after a single video appointment. I don't have insurance that will really cover regular appointments so it's the easiest for me.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"I am sorry that you went through this, it’s really unacceptable how some health professionals gaslight us into thinking our issues are not real. Shame on him. This is why I hate answering the question “what medications are you on” oh what’s that for? Followed by strange looks around. 

Hope you can find a better doctor who can treat you without judging you for how you choose to deal with your challenges."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,Sleep Dr. Needs to stay in their lane. 
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Meanwhile my sleepdoctor is like: It sounds like on top of your sleep apnea, you maybe have narcolepsy. But your ADHD meds are helping with the symptoms, so let's not rush the process and see where everything takes you first. 

I'm sorry for your horrible experience.

Edit for context: The full range of ADHD meds can be used offlabel to treat narcolepsy."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,report that doctor
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,Sounds like he got a Tik Tok degree.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,There are authorities you can report quacks to in most countries. You should do that. This fellow is a danger to his patients. Refuting facts on one area is in most cases just the tip of the iceberg with people like that.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,Report them.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,Ignore the SOB.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,You need to get your money back on the consult tbh
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"That reminds me, I need to take my ""speed"" today."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"New doctor time.

ADHD is the evolutionary path for human beings as we move forward. 

Every entrepreneur I know has ADHD. 

I worked through 16 years of Ritalin, concerta Straterra then went off meds until 34, tried them and found they were not for me.

I'm a powerhouse; I've built things in the high-ticket field that people wish they had the patience and the push for."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Why do we take what they have to say seriously?   Especially if this person is a sleep doctor. Find someone that understands how to help you and move on. If they said something that is considered reckless or dangerous, report them."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,You should report this Dr to the state board where you live.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,Find a new doctor and give that doctor a bad  Google review.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Your sleep doctor is a fucking moron… and he sounds like an asshole, too. I’d say fuck that guy and try to find another sleep specialist. Personally, I would’ve walked out of his office as soon as he said that shit to me. 

In any case, I hope you’re able to find some answers and relief for your sleep issues. I’ve had insomnia since I was a child. Fortunately, I found the right treatment and meds that work for both my ADHD (and other mental health diagnoses) as well as my insomnia. I don’t always sleep great, but it’s a huge improvement from what it once was."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"As someone diagnosed with ADHD and sleep apnea, I've since learned that there's a strange correlation between the two: 1/3 of people with ADHD also have sleep apnea.

I've had a CPAP for 10 years, and it was an amazing improvement, but it wasn't until being diagnosed with ADHD a couple years ago that things really got better."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"When it comes to my ADHD, i’ve been learning how to deal with it my whole life. If you don’t have it, or aren’t sympathetic towards people who have to deal with it, you are not an expert. I don’t care if you’re a Dr. So when somebody outside of my ADHD circle tries to pretend like they know more, I like to shut them down."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"I'm a retired registered nurse who worked in a sleep study clinic and prepped patients prior to their testing.

Drop that sleep doctor right now!  He has no business changing the meds prescribed by another doctor without making consultation with him/her."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Series of symptoms. Dude needs to go back to school, because that is what most things are. Hahaha."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,">ADHD isn’t real and that it’s a series of symptoms, not a diagnosis.

""Well, yes, both your legs are broken. And yes, you were wheeled in here from the sidewalk outside a 3 story office. And, yes again, multiple bystanders all described the same series of events. But those are just the symptoms of falling off a building. I can't diagnose you with that having happened, you see."""
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"File a professional complaint, refuse to pay the fee, find a new doctor. Don’t go back to that one."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"I really hate when people that are not involved in prescribing my mental health meds tell me how said mental health meds are not a good fit for me. Like, did you read my records of my recent hospitalization and my case file in general and come to that conclusion like my psychiatrist did or are you just parroting some shit you saw on Facebook from your uncle?

Also, I don't think many understand that ""speedy"" stuff doesn't speed me up at all. I frequently take my Ritalin in the morning and sleep when it kicks in a bit more because it makes me a lot calmer."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Great example of a Dr stuck in the age of misunderstood learning disorders. Me personally, if I had a Dr say that to me regardless of his role in my care I would have told him that he just called every single person who has been diagnosed and prescribed Adderall or something similar a drug seeking addict.

That said I would have stood up called him a fucking nineteenth Century level of knowledge quack and I’d rather never sleep again than sit in his office and listen to the babble dripping out of his moronic brain pushing out his mouth. There’s always another doctor who will treat you with dignity and respect and if I were you I d report him to the person who oversees the care r


I would then probably have a few words with him about how him being a know it all doctor who doesn’t know a fucking thing about modern medicine. Then respond with a comment that implies that every cancer patient doesn’t have cancer they are just junkies looking for a fix. What a fuckfaced tool"
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,You need a new sleep doctor.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Isn't every diagnosis a series of symptoms? I mean, a bunch of symptoms repeat over and over in a variety of people, so they give it a name to make it easier to identify. And, even if they never started labeling each series of symptoms, they'd still create and prescribe medicine to treat the symptoms. I mean, sleep disorders, including sleep apnea, are also just a series of symptoms, some of which create new symptoms when untreated. Wtf is wrong with people? You went to school to be a doctor, did you cheat on every exam to graduate and actually have no idea about medical anything?"
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Something interesting about sleep doctors is they think everything is fixed by improving sleep.

What they’re correct about is that poor sleep indeed does wreak havoc on the body.  What they’re wrong about is that poor sleep is the only condition that causes these symptoms.

I’m on CPAP for sleep apnea.  My sleep doctor is amazing and one of, if not THE BEST for sleep disorders in this area.

The flip side is that he thinks by fixing my sleep I can just stop treating my other health conditions with medication.  While sleep can affect those parts of my body, there are other conditions at play too that are independent of poor sleep.

To a hammer every problem is a nail.  And it seems sleep doctors having hot takes in areas outside of their focus is a thing."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"in addition to me echoing all of the validating sentiments in these comments, i suggest submitting a complaint to the state medical board too. there is room for skepticism in the field of medicine (and an absolute need for it) but your doc was way out of line with the way they presented this information. He was deliberately misleading and harmful in my opinion. Every disability in the DSM is described as a series of observable symptoms, not just ADHD. There is a lot of valid criticism since diagnosis is only rooted in symptoms not cause, but that is the case for the majority of disabilities in the DSM. While this reality leaves much to be disputed and discovered about ADHD and other disabilities, it does not invalidate their existence. sounds like you need a different doctor. sorry they were an arrogant POS."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"I wouldnt say I was outwardly ridiculed like this but similar course.

had insomnia my whole life.

got worse 2022 after graduating college to the point i was not sleeping for days on end

started going to sleep doctors etc

put on trazodone after sleep test (no sleep apnea) and anti depressants 

went on leave from work -> then quit my job lol

between my first appointment and quitting my job I brought up that i think i have add

doctor said nah u seem like u just want it for fun. 

got new job

went off anti depressants 1 year later

fast forward 2 years (2024) I have a add diagnosis and definitely was not faking it.

  
if i mess something up at work i never say Its because of my add because I dont want people like ur doctor to think im making shit up in my head and just being a lazy piece of shit that cant do anything right. its hard out here sometimes"
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,You should tell your prescribing physician about this.  It's not one doctors job to alter another doctors treatment plan without talking to them first. That's why you sign the info release when you do your new patient paperwork. It's so they can talk to each other to coordinate care.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,Its crazy how many doctors are just IDIOTS
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Wow  this post really made me upset and protective of you. Unfortunately there’s always going to be a few bad professionals in the group, just like any group. I’m so sorry that he made me feel in-validated."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,I’ve been working in the medical field for 3+ years now and let me tell you…many many MANY providers really really should have never become physicians. I’m sorry this happened to you. You know it’s not the truth and we all know it’s not the truth.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"I would report that doctor, actually. That sounds horribly unprofessional and I'm sure whoever runs that clinic or hospital needs to know that. ADHD is a well-understood disorder."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"This doctor got through medical school with absolutely no brain.

That’s apparent.

He should go for a neuro check himself… just to make sure he’s ok upstairs."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,What does he need fucking brain scans??? Because those can show adhd too so idk wtf he’s on about
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,You can literally see the difference in people's brains with ADHD. This guy needs to get slapped. Also when I take my meds I have zero energy so he can fuck off.. if I didn't have ADHD in pretty sure it would make me go faster
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,He's just jealous cuz his mind only works in a straight line and he's never found his keys in the fridge.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Name and shame on this one. If he wants to take on the established medical practice that he is in he better be able to publicly defend himself.


My bet thou is that you weren't hearing from a doctor but rather a technician"
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Im sorry about that. I’m just laughing at how the dr accuses of you wanting speed, but adhd is pretty much that: we’re seeking help because we want to slow down. My mind is constantly at a 10000 mph and medication helps me slow it down a little."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,What an ignorant jackass. I'm sorry you had that experience.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"First of all, there is a ""real test"" to confirm an ADHD diagnosis. It's called a QB Test, and I have done one. I definitely have ADHD. I also have OCD and autism. 

This dude is a moron, and I would report him. He should not be practicing medicine."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,As if I slept any better unmedicated… fire that guy. He’s stupid. Go further than that and report him.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Fun fact: you can absolutely have ADHD and Narcolepsy *and* Insomnia (caused by the Narcolepsy and ADHD-related delayed sleep phase.)



I do. My pulmonologist even said its not uncommon for people with ADHD to not get their Narcolepsy diagnosed until later than normal. Because their ADHD meds *are some of the exact medications used to treat Narcolepsy*. 


Both conditions are very real and absolutely impact people's lives. Both conditions can have weird interactions with eachother. Both conditions can be treated with the same medications (for wakefulness at least) but you may need to do adjustments and another nighttime med to sleep properly. You can absolutely do a sleep study while still being on ADHD medication.



Your lived experience is real and valid. I'm proud of you for trying to get help for your sleep problems. I'm furious on your behalf and hope that it is possible for you to report this doctor. You deserve proper assessment, diagnosis, and treatment."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"When I saw a sleep dr. He decided I had sleep apnea because, in his opinion I had a big tongue. I do not have sleep apnea and knew this. I do have chronic insomnia. He sent me for the sleep study and had a surprised pikachu face when telling me that I did not in fact have sleep apnea, but that I do in fact have chronic insomnia. No shit Sherlock… yet again I’m still awake at 3am thinking damn I have to start work in 4 and a half hours. Some drs are just idiots."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,I’m sure he has no scientific studies to back up his delusions. Ignore and move forward.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,We've all dealt with that indeed. It's not always that explicit but just know you're not alone. ADHD can be at least partially responsible for your sleep troubles. I know I had to learn the hard way myself how to get a consistent sleep schedule down. I still have trouble anyway though even after all I've learned. Our ADHD brains just don't know how to switch off and relax sometimes. Good luck my friend.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,Not sure where you’re located but I would definitely dispute the charges if I were you. Find the orgs Patient Relations department and tell them what an unhelpful and alienating experience it was. It may come to nothing but it may also result in your bill being reduced or removed.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Sleep doctors aren’t real. They’re just regular doctors wanting to watch people sleep. /s

Sorry to hear you had a bad experience. Sometimes doctors are idiots too"
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"If this doctor truly had read about adhd… I mean, observations all the way back to 1798. Whenever I learn that another patient is being dismissed as a liar and a drug-addict, I get more and more convinced that these doctors either; 1. have an agenda, meaning they see us as a problem too big to solve, and now they don’t know what to do with us. OR they are just so uneducated, and have not been to any classes about adhd or THE BRAIN even. Learn about the brain and you will understand how much some of us suffer!"
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"You gotta report him to the medical board. This is unacceptable. Not only is he demonizing mental health, he’s not acknowledging that it’s an official diagnosis in the DSM-5. 

Also get a new doctor."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,That’s why he’s a fucking “sleep” dr lol
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Wow! I’m sorry you went through this. I’d be very uncomfortable in that situation. It’s also really insulting and unprofessional. If the sleep study Dr is so concerned, then he should discuss it with your doctors. It’s not fair for the Dr to put all that on you. 

When you feel up to it, please consider filing a report about this do that this doctor doesn’t continue treating other patients like this. 

At the bare minimum, please tell the Dr, that referred you to the sleep study, what happened. 

Hope you feel better soon and get stuff sorted out."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Probably an “alternative med” doctor. Avoid them, ignore everything he said. Only shame that you paid. Just find a decent doctor."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"My husband's primary doctor basically told him the same thing. He was just like listen, my life isn't easy either, I can give you the number for some therapists. But wouldn't discuss medication. It took him months to work up the nerve to ask for help because it's embarrassing and he didn't want the doctor to think he was making things up. We need to find a new doctor."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,My doctor literally just told me this. Wonder if we go to the same doc
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"This dude is a sleep doctor spouting off bullshit about a mental health issue, just because he works with the brain doesn’t mean he knows the same as an outright mental health professional lmfao

Guy sounds like a fuckin dick and the medical board would absolutely hold THAT against him if it was reported, because at the end of the day, he’s just rambling on about some weird conspiracy that goes against established medical knowledge and making certain patients feel invalid. 

Hot take but I don’t really think that’s something a *doctor* should be doing, and I’m inclined to think the medical board would agree there. 

Using your position as a *doctor*, someone a lot of people inherently trust, especially knowledge wise, to spread anti science ramblings as truth is pretty fuckin distasteful. 

Sure ADHD is a series of symptoms but so is pretty much every single other mental health issue, there’s no concrete lab test that goes “yep you have depression/adhd/anxiety etc"" like you get with most other ailments. 

Ours isn’t any *less* real just because it can be treated with little party pills, I’m really sorry you had to with through that shit, I hope you’re doing better now."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,Time to find a new sleep doctor.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"ADHD is absolutely real. As a matter of fact, it can be seen on brain imaging. Time to go back to school or get reported, doc."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,Was this a MD? I bet not.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,That pathetic charlatan doesn’t know the first thing about anything.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"...fire your sleep doctor, please. Try caffeine, if you start yawning thirty minutes after ingesting it, congratulations! You have that odd side effect to having ADHD that turns caffeine from wake-up juice into a sleep aid.

Chocolate, coffee, tea, soda but you have to go easy with the sugar for it to work as a sleep aid. I dump about a fifth of a sugar shaker into my morning cup of coffee to jumpstart my body into ignoring the urge to sleep so it might help.

It'll damn sure help you better than a doctor who disregards the work of other doctors."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Weirdly, my sleep doc said my insomnia was partly due to ADHD, genetics, and mild sleep apnea. I tried CPAP because the insomnia was driving me crazy, but it hasn’t helped much with sleep. He prescribed guanfacine though, and it’s been great for both my sleep and ADHD. Who knew? lol"
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Plz report. I don’t usually go this direction but ADHD is truly a diagnosis, it’s physical, and it does impact sleep. If you were blind, would you tolerate a doctor telling you that you could obviously see and just needed to try harder? Plz plz report."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Not only do you need to find a new doctor, that doctor needs to be reported. That's just wrong on so many levels"
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,report him to the board of medicine for practicing outside of his scope. it is a major malpractice and ethics issue. also because he's blatantly wrong.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Hey so sorry about this. Finding a good Medical Doctor is like finding a good therapist, restaurant, or mechanic. Sometimes you luck out on the first one, but most of the time you have to try a few duds to find the good ones. 

Please find a new sleep doctor and try again. (Don’t tell the new office about why you needed to switch, in fact you don’t even need to tell them you saw the other Dr. keep trying them out until you find one that works. 

Don’t let this experience impact your health!"
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,Complain. They shouldn't be spouting non-scientifically based opinions.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"> he spent most of the appointment talking about how ADHD isn’t real and that it’s a series of symptoms, not a diagnosis.

Isn’t… isn’t *literally every diagnosis of any medical/psychological issue* a “series of symptoms”?? That’s what the definition of a diagnosis is??? A list of symptoms that are grouped together often enough to warrant being defined as a disease or condition that doctors can treat. 

This guy just doesn’t know or understand what he’s talking about. He’s not a psychologist, he has no experience or training with diagnosing or treating ADHD, he has no standing to be making such claims or wanting to change your prescriptions. 

It’s like if you went to the eye doctor to get glasses and they were like “depression isn’t real! You just need to go outside and smile more! Let’s get you off of Prozac and enrolled at a gym, that’ll cure you!” Ridiculousness. The sleep doctor needs to stay in his lane."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"If God is real, you are able to find a new sleep doctor at the moment."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,">telling me to read a book about how ADHD is fake.

Or maybe he can read the all the books on why it’s not fake?  If he’s willing to only read a book that fits his bias, I wonder how good he really is at his profession."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,Tell him that his choleric nature is a sign that his humours are imbalanced and he needs to purge to reduce his yellow bile. Then go and see a doctor who has actually studied modern medicine.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Next time you see this sleep doctor ask to see his credentials and when he shows you their “credentials”, if it doesn’t say Somnologist, you can remind them that they’re not a real doctor and whatever night school “training” they got entitles them to cram their opinions."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,I’m so sick of this mentality. I feel like it’s way too common among professionals- but anyone who thinks this obviously does not have ADHD and has never experienced what medication can do for their focus
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,I would have called him a fucking idiot and walked out lol
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"And this is why just because you reach dr status, does not mean you are actually a competent one or have any fucking right giving anyone medical advice when you don't know what the fuck you're even talking about. 

I think there should be a stipulation for Dr's that if a patient has to do their job and diagnose themselves or correct that drs ignorance, their license should be subject to a lengthy review where they should have to pass some sort of test to prove they are competent enough to not cause any further harm to a patient. If they don't pass that should be IT for their medical career. 

Fuckers take an oath to do no harm, but if a patient is suffering and the dr does nothing to try and improve your situation, that is neglect. Neglect IS abuse, and should not be seen any differently for Dr's.  Yeah, it's just another job, but they chose that job knowing what was expected of them. In any other field this shit would result in firing, but for Dr's they just have to fob the patient off until they give up. 

How is this ok."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,What the fuck is a diagnosis but a series of symptoms? Don't get psych advice from a doctor speaking outside their specialty.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,Get a new doctor. That person is an idiot.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"""doctor"". Pff. Did he have wings and a bill? Koz he's a quack."

Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,It’s always so helpful when someone lets you know upfront that they’re bad at their job and that you don’t need to spend any of your precious time on earth listening to them. Shoutout to those helpful folks! ❤️
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"ah yes because i just love taking a medication that puts my heart at risk just so i can fold laundry 🙄 what a moron, sorry you had to deal with that op. i hope you can find a better sleep doctor soon."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,Bro just go to a private doctor fuck him
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,Well last few years anyone who walks in is diagnosed with it n meds prescribed within minutes hard to believe wasnt needed years ago
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,What country?
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Go to an ENT instead. That's how I got diagnosed with Sleep Apnea. Only time I saw a Sleep doctor was for the actual sleep study.

I also have narcolepsy because of the 20 year sleep deficit I have so the ADHD meds keep me up through the day too"
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,So why when I get “speed” does it put me tf to sleep?!
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,What a little fuck
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,Sleep doc needs to shut his piehole and definitely be reported unless he is a psychiatrist he doesn’t have the same education and sounds like a skeptic and POS.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,Yeah and my sleep apnea isn’t real either. Just lose weight that’ll fix it… Just an excuse to get a CPAP machine. Lol. It’s so interesting how a medical doctor is so ill informed about neuroscience.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,ADHD is a valid diagnosis as you will know. And this is the reason why getting a second opinion is something that needs to be way more common. And please please report this doctor. Like say he's one in a group of doctors out of that office report them to the other doctors and look at what other bodies in your area that you would report bad Doctor into. You have to think of the next person who gets seen by him and how badly that could affect their health. That's why it's worth your time to report him. I myself have had numerous sleep studies and never ever has one of the doctors ever said such asinine things to me.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,Leave a bad public review so other people are warned
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"I take this ""speed"" and all I do is like... fold my laundry instead of letting it sit for days. Somehow I don't think he has a damn clue what he's talking about"
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,Run! Don’t walk out of that office! I been there. If you don’t suffer you don’t know. I don’t waste my time explaining to people any more. Find another Dr .

Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"I take his speed and my mind is less chaotic. I don’t necessarily have the energy to just do things but when I do them, I can manage to finish them and be less distracted. 
My mood, anxiety and depression improve because I have enough cognitive abilities to concentrate, comprehend and process things in my mind, complete tasks and feel in control of my symptoms. They don’t go away but they do improve. 

Seek another doctor. The sleep apnea could be a possibility though. A lot of ADHD people have sleep apnea. I have UARS, it’s a form of apnea."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,Fuck them
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Don't take this as anti-science, psychiatry is still all we have, but...Honestly, we give doctors (the mental health variety) wayyyy too much credit.   We treat them the same as those who treat physical, tangible ailments, but science's knowledge of the brain is extremely limited at this point in history.  But we act and they act like it's exactly the same as physical medicine, which has things like MRI's, Xrays....actual diagnostic tools.  The only tools they have are words (your words describing your interpretation of your own emotion, and their interpretation of your interpretation) and their observation of you for 30 minutes in their office X number of times a year.   They don't have much data to go on, but we treat mental health diagnoses the same as a broken bone.

All that is to say, that sleep doctor doesn't know his ass from his elbow, and most of the doctors I've been to in my life could most favorably be described as ""winging it.""  I mean, psychiatrist are at least supposed to be the experts on the drug aspect, but fucking pharmacists have said to me ""your doctor prescribed two medicines that are contraindicated.""  I.e., he prescribed two drugs that'll fuck you up if you take them together, yet he's supposed to be the drug expert.  It's a very good thing that society is becoming more accepting of mental health, but that field of medicine has a long long way to go to be reliable."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"If that doctor has kids, there's a decent chance he'll end up estranged from them"
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,I bet you he doesn't believe in vaccines too.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Yeah I mean it’s not a black/white, real or not real issue, but he has some compelling points.

Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,Well at least you're getting your speed through the legal channels. Hurrah! 
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,I'm on an ADHD med called Intuniv. It's a true downer. It's only FDA approved for kids the last I knew. Ask your doctor about it
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"OP, I’m not sure who will break it to your doctor, but “a series of symptoms” is, in fact, a diagnosis, according to the DSM."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Thanks, and he did make a comment at one point that “if I was a psychiatrist I would treat my “ADHD” patients with so and so non-stim meds”. Like yeah but you’re not a psychiatrist."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"I'd go even further to say that the physician is acting well outside their area of expertise bordering on malice in their attempt to dismantle another physicians diagnosis. This is dangerous and akin to listening to somebody who's been duped by some bullshit on the internet. If this doctor truly believed in First Do No Harm, they wouldn't be undermining their colleagues in the medical field. 

Do the sleep test. Don't take psychological or psychiatric advice from a respiratory and sleep physician."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"I Disagree with ""should stay in his lane"", he shouldn't be a doctor.

He clearly has no idea how to do his job, which is helping people.

OP, your gut feeling about this guy is on point. Never see him again."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,Report him
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Kinda wanna walk up to him and say ""sleep disorders aren't real and are just an excuse to take downers."""
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,Exactly! OP should report him!
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"I might look into it but honestly in the past I’ve also reported a doctor for telling me my depression isn’t real because I went to law school and didn’t want to write a repeat script for my meds, but that went nowhere. At the very least I’ll tell my referring doctor about the experience so no one else has to deal with him from her.

And sorry you went through that. My diagnosis is recent and I’ve already experienced so much judgment and denial from pharmacists, family etc. I really feel for you all."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,Childhood and adulthood 😅
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"""Adhd isnt real and an excuse to take meth pills"" is the most damaging narrative. My dad knew i had adhd when i was in the single digits (he never told me and didn't want me on meds) and I didn't get medicine until I could legally recieve and pay for it myself. My dad always did his best to prevent me from seeing psychiatrists or discouraged me because he thought they were all evil, predatory, greedy, etc. I tried to help myself for years without meds - which led people to think that my genuine, back breaking best was not actually my best (the most potent ropefuel, it is a horrible feeling), because I NEEDED meds. Strong ones. Not fucking prozac. Real, serious meds. I actually did not benefit from cbt because I had already been practicing for years, but you cannot cognition your way out of a physical illness no matter how hard you try."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"You all want to report this guy because he has a different take on prescribed stimulant medication? Y’all want him to loose his job because he doesn’t agree with op? My new Dr also said that they don’t prescribe stimulants to adults at her clinic. They started me on strattera, should I report her too? I’m sorry but this type of talk makes me fearful for the future."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Oh wow that was exactly my experience. The whole time he was babbling (40 minutes) about himself and his views and then about his tax affairs, I was thinking wow he should get tested for ADHD. Also said he has sleep apnea himself. Clearly he’s cured."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"They do have a point that there are people being diagnosed with ADHD who actually have a sleep problem. The symptoms are shockingly similar. But ADHD is not, generally, caused by poor sleep."

Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"100%. He even went so far to scoff at my psychiatrist for diagnosing me and rolling his eyes when I said my GP also has been given authority to prescribe my meds. Said if there’s no definitive medical test for it, it’s not real. I was hoping to finally get a CPAP so I can get some sleep but guess it’s going to take a bit longer 😭"
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"There are better books for him to read. The DSM has the rules, but it is very political due to being the basis of treatment, prescription, and insurance coverage.

There is plenty of evidence of ADHD, though. It occurs, it has a mechanism (reduced executive function), and it has consequences. All three of those components have been confirmed through many studies."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,😆
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,i just really need to point out the irony of a sleep doctor that is in such a desperate need to wake up
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,Or he cheated his way through medical school by having someone do his homework assignments.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,My GP did refer me to him which was a shock because my GP generally is very good. I’m guessing she didn’t know about all his wild views. In the sleep side of things he seemed to know his stuff which is a shame because I won’t be dealing with him anymore.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Yeah and honestly I was doing a lot better with accepting my diagnosis recently only for this to happen. But oh well, he can shout into the void about it."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,It’s very similar. Just the prescribed stuff is cleaner. 
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,I’ve also found a lot of them extremely condescending. I think it’s a matter of them thinking they’re super intelligent and knowledgeable about one thing so therefore they must know everything!

Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"The vibe I got from him was that he wanted to take over everything. I did consider just sticking through with the sleep study but the problem is if he doesn’t believe ADHD is real, he won’t be able to help me holistically. He didn’t want me on any stimulants, period. And that was part of his plan moving forward after the sleep study."

Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,And making so much money!

Meanwhile he told me he’s spending $17k on his tax agent and charging almost $500 for this appointment.

Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"That's a bad idea, you should just listen to doctors who follow the consensus, if you think there's something wrong with what your doctor is telling you, you can always get a second opinion.

Doing your own research for most people means digging themselves into a rabbit hole of conspiracy theories or pseudoscience.

The consensus of doctors might be wrong 5% of the time but  what you find on social media is wrong 50% of the time.

The exception to this is if by doing your own research you mean looking at the guidelines or more ""official pages""  for example the American psychological association."

Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,I’m glad you got a sleep doctor that’s actually informed. Can I ask how your experience with Guanfacine was? I’m seeing my GP today and was going to ask to change to Guanfacine from Clonidine.

There actually is a difference between knowledge of drugs to prescribe and knowledge of drugs themselves.

Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,If you’re in Australia absolutely report them to the HCCC (Health Care Complaints Commission) they take this shit very seriously and the doctor will have to respond to the complaint. It’s recorded against the doctors records even if no action is taken. And with repeated complaints they can have real consequences to their practice and even registration. It’s also a service to future patients.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"> in the past I’ve also reported a doctor for telling me my depression isn’t real because I went to law school and didn’t want to write a repeat script for my meds, but that went nowhere.

If a single report were to go somewhere, no Doctor would be able to stay in business. After all, any such feedback system will be abused by people who either overreact to things or expect freebies to be awarded for belligerence.

However, if a Doctor amasses reports at a significantly faster rate than other Doctors, that will eventually go somewhere. Your honest report is crucial to pushing a bad Doctor's rate of reports up."

It could very well go nowhere, but if you make public posts about it you could reach possible future patients who will know to run far away because you spoke up and didn't let them get away with it. 

But if you don't do anything there is zero chance of anything coming from it. In fact, because you didn't say anything, no one will even know to keep an eye on him, no one will ever even broach the topic of how wrong this is with him and he will only become further emboldened to assert his conspiracy theories even louder. And because he's a dr people will stupidly listen, cause a dr is supposed to help, right?

I know it's hard when you're already going through a lot... but think of the next person just getting diagnosed who may be a young child and not know better. You could help them."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,How do pharmacists provide negative impute? Or what have they said?
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"My psych talks the same way (well, slower), and when I told him all the stuff she said, his expression was extremely confused, then irritated and almost infuriated because she had basically accused him of malpractice by prescribing me sleep aids and Vyvanse. Amazing how two people can finish med school with similar conditions and end up so different."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"I was diagnosed with bipolar and narcolepsy before I was correctly diagnosed with ADHD (which more accurately matched the symptoms they called bipolar) and autism (turns out if I avoid sensory overstimulation I don't have autistic shutdowns, aka the naps I would have to take during the day that they thought were narcolepsy despite having difficulty sleeping)."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"I have sleep apnea and ADHD. The lack of sleep from the apnea definitely fueled the ADHD. It does not cause ADHD, but it absolutely threw fuel on the flames.

Even with my apnea treated incredibly effectively I still have ""psychological insomnia"" caused by the ADHD. It took my sleep doctor referring me to a therapist who referred me to a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with the ADHD causing the psychological insomnia.

Now I'm waiting on an autism diagnosis. 

Feeling completely broken for 35+ years and always being told it was due to my weight and couldn't possibly be anything else. Not even the apnea was the weight! In fact I've needed progressively higher CPAP pressures as I've lost weight..."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"I had the opposite problem, but the incorrect narcolepsy diagnosis was more related to my (also much later diagnosed) autism. I am not surprised, though, that the opposite to my experience could happen too."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"When I had someone come at me with this, I had a definite line of defense. For one, my adderall has never once made me feel ""high, ""euphoric"", ""invincible"",  ""calm"", or keep me up all night.  What it makes me feel is normal and focused. Able to function, able to concentrate and process information. Able to finish a task from start to finish.

 Then, secondly, I had to tell two different people, one a pharmacist, one a tech,  that their job was litetally to fill what my doctor had prescribed, not to judge. Consultation is not an evaluation. They can tell me what to expect in the way of side effects, what drugs will cause interactions, how much and what strength my doctor prescribed..... but they are not doctors, and I don't come to the pharmacy for moral advice. 

I changed pharmacy's after that encounter,  and the one I have now is so awesome. 

Before I changed, the same pharmacy denied me pain needs after a rotator cuff surgery. The med my surgeon first prescribed me made me nauseated and gave me headaches, so he gave me a handwritten prescription for a different pain reliever. My son took me to the pharmacy since I was in a sling, and he was behind me in line, 6'3"" and in sunglasses because he is ADHD also and suffers light sensitivity, especially fluorescent lights. They looked from me to him, went in the back, had a conversation, and came back and said they couldn't fill it because it had only been 24 hrs since the first controlled substance. I explained I couldn't tolerate that one, and I HAD IT WITH ME and told them I would gladly hand them back to destroy or whatever, but they said no and treated us like freaking thugs and made everyone in the line watch us like we were gonna rob the joint. It was so humiliating. 

I understand controlled substances are abused. Without a doubt, it's an epidemic. But it really makes it suck for the non-addicts  just trying to function. I try hard not to judge those in the throes of addiction. That is a sad way of life, but not everyone taking a controlled substance is controlled by that substance."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Ironically a lot of people believe this, even people who take stimulants, as if all stimulants were the same.  ADHD stimulants *at therapeutic doses* simply don’t have the kind of tolerance inducing effects like caffeine and recreational drugs do"
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,This doctor needs to lose their license and end up in poverty for thinking like that.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,I was on #teamcaffine - 3 Red Bull day prior to diagnosis.  My heart thanks me for the concerta switch lol (also think it was the duolexitine I was taking for panic attacks that also was fucking with my sleep.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Vyvanse naps are the best.
Comfiest feeling is taking meds really early in the morning and then just dozing until my phone rings, always imagine myself as from Homer the Heretic episode, ""just a toasty cinnamon bun"" lol."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"During my vynanse time, I sometimes get tired and my ""naps"" are me just disassociating for 20 mins, which do make me feel refreshed in a weird way. When they wear off though, those naps are great.. just woken up from one of those bad boys, forgot to drink water though beforehand and I'm like a prawny raisen"
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,I swear vyvanse has helped my sleep so much. My caffeine and sugar addictions have faded too. It’s amazing
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,It has really help me I have had really big sleep problems all my life till I started on vyvanse I was on ritalin for a bit before that helped a little bit but not as much never felt more rested in my life
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,There’s no definitive medical test for a freeking headache! Ppl just have to believe your self reported symptoms!!!
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,">Said if there’s no definitive medical test for it, it’s not real

I hope that person gets some sort of very bothersome ailment that is difficult to diagnose."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Well you should have gotten the sleep study. It took me seven or eight months from start to finish to get my CPAP. It was a real pain in the butt. And all throughout that I was sleeping horribly. You do the best you can with what you got. There's no definitive test for ADHD, but there are definitive and pristine guidelines written in that book. Anyone who overlooks that is unprofessional and uneducated. I actually never met my sleep doctor, I just want to sleep study and had it done over two nights. It was very uncomfortable. It actually got so bad with the delay, that I went out on bought a used one on Craigslist. I need a super high fan speed, and my fan kept getting stuck with the used one. I did sanitize the hell out of all the implements. Like 30 minutes resting and bleach solution."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Does this specialist have their own practice and business or are they a part of a healthcare network or hospital? 

Depending on the situation, you could report them to the healthcare network/hospital. Even if nothing happens from this interaction, there will be a paper trail on him now. He’ll show his ass again."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,Doesn’t really work like that
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,You'll want to share that info with your GP.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Hope you refused to pay him, or payed with fake money and told him ""only real doctors are paid real money"" 🙈😂 Damn I hate people like him"
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"If you had to use insurance to pay for the session or perhaps had to use it in some way then I would suggest you let them know. Also if someone specifically referred you to them then let them know of your interaction, especially if it was the psychiatrist.  
  
When my wife had our first kid her obstetrician (pregnancy and delivery doc) gave her a referral for a paediatrician (baby doctor) because of something that was going on with our son that he, and all the hospital doctors, nurses and even medical students agreed was going on. The paediatrician basically said that they were all wrong and tried to turn it back on my wife as something she had done.  
  
Afterwards she called her obstetrician absolutely livid and he both got our kid a slot with another doctor for the next day that had a minimum of a three weeks waiting list, but he also removed the first doctor from his referral list."

Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"That is nursing school, not med school. You should know the difference.

Some doctors can be absolute fucking asshats."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Good. But, it varies by the individual, not the med."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"OK, bad example.  Here's another:  many psychiatrists will prescribe naltrexone to alcoholics.  I used to be about as bad an alcoholic as you can imagine, I was given the choice of that or another.  The main ""selling point"" (probably literally) is that it ""prevents cravings"".  The way it does this is by basically dulling the effects of alcohol, then over time you won't associate alcohol with pleasure.  Problem is, *you have to drink* to get the craving-preventing effect.  And if you're a serious alcoholic, you can't do that.  And really, you'll keep drinking anyway, because with your tolerance you barely feel anything until you're blacked out anyway.

Point being, in my experience psychiatrists have never seemed that sharp, and can have the potential to do a lot more harm than good.  They should be below psychologists on the ladder, who are in a better position to make an accurate diagnosis and actually follow the latest research."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Huh? Don't know where your psychiatrist picked up their papers but most countries will require them to have formal training, over and above that they got in general medical training, on pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and drug interactions. They might discuss with a pharmacist on off-label or unusual presentations/interactions, but it's not a case of ""ideally"". All medical students will have had courses on drug interactions, and any mental health specialist will have had training on near any drugs they would prescribe."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Definitely not his field, despite some overlap in meds used for other sleep disorders and comorbidity between sleep disorders and ADHD. When I mentioned that comorbidity he basically said it’s because everyone is sleep deprived and other factors which present as “ADHD” but ADHD doesn’t exist."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Exactly. After reading the doctor's logic regarding ADHD I'm starting to wonder if Diabetes even exists at all. Seriously, all I have are a hodgepodge of symptoms. Could it be that i don't actually need insulin? 

That effing doctor is dangerous."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Having watched a lot of House MD, are you sure lupus is even real? I thought it was just a way of saying we should run more tests because we don't know what it is. "

Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"""the identification of the nature of an illness or other problem by examination of the symptoms"" is how Webster's defines it. Unless you are trying to make the case that ""it's only a diagnosis if it's been diagnosed.""

Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,What he is doing is considered medical malpractice in most jurisdictions in the US and could get his license revoked if enough people report him.  And he absolutely should be reported.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"For ADHD? 

You need to get a referral from your GP to a psychiatrist who does ADHD assessments. Make sure the clinic you're referred to can prescribe meds because many can't. 

Then you go and do the tests with the psychiatrist."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Aussie here. If you're a uni student, you can also check out the psychologists on-campus. Like, get your GP to refer you to them. I've been looking into it, & I found out that my uni (U of Newcastle) does assessments for $300, instead of ... yeah, thousands. The thing is, they are generally PhD students or whatever, but of course they are absolutely supervised by someone fully accredited & with more experience. It's really the expense of the range of diagnostic tests that you're trying to avoid -- so uni psych is defs an option. For general, ongoing counselling / psychiatrist, tho, you can return to whoever you've found that you're comfortable with -- but I'm pretty sure they offer those services thru my uni too. You can check for yourself to confirm, but I think they are actually open to non-students. An option to look into, for sure!

Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"I had a doctor once ask me if I thought my ADHD med might be causing my insomnia since she saw that I take medication for both.  I told her that sometimes I take my ADHD meds to stop my racing thoughts so I can sleep, and she was like, ""oh, you're good then."" (Also it's usually my wacky work schedule that causes my insomnia.)"
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Wow, that's quite the journey. That narcolepsy diagnosis in some ways isn't as crazy as it sounds, even if it wasn't right. The symptoms of shutting down due to sensory stimulation are a hallmark of cataplexy, which is closely related and a symptom of narcolepsy in some. Whereas, as I'm sure you know and experience, sensory overstimulation in ASD tends to cause meltdowns, isolation, anxiety, and communicative shutdowns, etc. Though of course the mental exhaustion of these causes severe tiredness. Also the sleeping problems (counterintuitively) are really common for narcolepsy. Glad you got it sorted in the end though, these conditions are so complex and in many cases so similar."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,It has to be illegal somehow for a pharmacist to deny your medication without valid reasons.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,Pharmacists know all of that and still choose to judge you so don’t feel for them.

Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"The funny thing is before I started adderall, I was plagued by migrains.  I went to a neurologist, had MRIs done, tons of tests, none of the various medications helped, even Tramadol just put a small dent in the pain.

When I was diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed Adderall and Guanfacine, my migrains went away.  It is weird."

Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"yeah the identification... by a professional, that is. 

I mean technically the diagnosis is just the act of aknowledging the symptoms consciously and putting them into relation?

Maybe I'm just being pedantic in the end."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"I take Modafinil off label for ADHD and it works amazingly well for me. 
I prefer it over traditional stimulants by a lot as it causes far less emotional side effects and doesn’t make me feel like a Robot. 

On it, I don’t loose any of my exuberance and bubbliness like I do on traditional stimulants, but do get the benefit of being able to direct myself into hyper focusing on whatever I desire to do without endlessly being sidetracked. 

Your mileage may vary, obviously.

For reference, I am 39F and was diagnosed at age 10, and have been on medication for ADHD for much of my life."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,Modafinil is sometimes used off-label for ADHD but it apparently works worse than other stimulants in adults.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,">prescribes them Modafinil

Your doctor is a straight up idiot."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"I've tried modafinil and it had a much stronger stimulant effect than any of the ADHD meds. It was more like an energy pill rather than something that helps with focus. It was also a lot closer to a party drug effect than any of the ADHD stimulants. 

Basically that sleep ""doctor"" (I'm doubtful about the actual doctor status) is an idiot"
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"I tried that and thought it was ok, but it still wasn't really a good fit for me (stimulants weren't really a good fit for me)"
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Did you get a script for this? It might be worth trying..

Maybe email or call and say you were busy trying tonprocess all the information and would lile to take him up.on the offer...can they email.or text a script.of modafinil so you can try.

I have in the past 1-2months been prescribed this for chronic fatigue as its like a synthetic speed with no/less dependency issues.

I very strongly suspect I have adhd (brother dx cpl yrs ago when his son was suspected and picked up). Ive thought it for yrs but couldnt afford the official dx/testing in Australia to be prescribed any meds.

Modafinil even very low dose, helps me focus and be far more alert - way less scatter brained and i stay on task. Or even spend 5-12hrs in a zoned out focused trance losing all time.

Might be worth a shot to investigate :)"

Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Yes that's what I meant, sorry about being unintentionally ambiguous. So it's not that different then, if not identical.

As I've heard of different people having to go through hoops with their GP before getting referred and want sure where Australia was on this scale."

It depends on the state, but as a general rule you can’t record someone in private without their consent - and I’d certainly not recommend recording someone without it."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"The flip side to that is that the students who do worse in med school are often the ones who have better ""bedside manner"", since they keep a better work-life balance, are more social, and are able to empathize better with others."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,C you at graduation
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Yeah, the main reason I'm sure that it's not the combination of ASD/ADHD and narcolepsy is that the sleep doc told me directly that I barely could qualify for the diagnosis but she was putting it in so she could get me the medication for the daytime sleepiness. Which was originally Ritalin but I told her I was calmer but not more awake, and didn't connect the dots lol. Then Modafinil which I took until my ADHD diagnosis and realizing I had ASD before my formal diagnosis, and adjusting my environment to find out I could keep from passing out by managing my light and other sensory sensitivity."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"It's not, in the US. In many cases, it's legal specifically because politicians wanted to be able to have pharmacists refuse to dispense birth control or the pill used during very early abortions."

Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Exactly.  With the exception of super rare metabolisms, or folks just misreporting their initial adjustment phase…. you got people out here taking way too much of it (if not abusing the crap out of it) but go all Surprised Pikachu when they report tolerance / withdrawal symptoms 🤦‍♂️.  

Especially drives me crazy that these people don’t bother mentioning that fact when coming on Reddit trying to discourage people from taking them at all, which is a tragedy"

Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,I'm glad you're self advocating. You deserve good sleep. 
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,Yes! Absolutely this. 🤣🤣
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,You’ve never felt a rush like when that insulin finally hits your subcutaneous adipose tissue 😵‍💫
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"I suppose I was reading between the lines and assuming that OP had been diagnosed by a professional, given the Vyvannse script.

But I agree, a diagnosis is noticing a suite of symptoms commonly held as diagnostic criteria for a condition/syndrome/disease/disorder, usually with the aim of facilitating treatment for said symptoms."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,39F?
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,You seem to have missed the point. His job is to diagnose sleep problems. Adhd causes sleep problems. HE SHOULD EFFING KNOW THIS.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"If you’ve got a diagnosis your GP can apply for authority to manage your medication (within the boundaries laid out by the Psychiatrist), saves having to go back and forth with a Psych. 

Although in my and my wifes experience its a real mixed bag of results depending on the GP, some just don’t want to deal with it."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Hey mate, also an Aussie that has just gone through the process of diagnosis. But it’s pretty much as described. GP -> referral to psych -> evaluation, diagnosis, treatment plan -> GP. Once diagnosed you’ll probably need blood tests, urine test (supervised), and ecg. The GP applies for permission to prescribe if going onto a controlled substance (ie stimulant). Then titration of dose (will depend on the medication as to what that looks like). 

Feel free to send me a DM if you have questions though."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Pharmacist have always been able to do this,Long before I was diagnosed, I couldn't get codeine after oral surgery on the original script. that is and has always been I am black thing. Image pharmacist making you feel like a ""thug"" getting your grandmothers heart meds. My doctors don't deny ADHD is real, they don't believe I have it, the doc that diagnosed me prescribed adderall and diazepan, after she went to the VA-I could complain she went to the VA-I have been cognitive tested 6x I won't do it a gain, made to chose between sleeping and functioning. they will give me the adderall but not the sleep aid or the sleep aid and not adderall. I use to pick the diazepan in the summer the long day made make the insomnia worse.but I read an article that said being off your meds give you a much higher chance if get dementia and alzheimer's, so I don't get sleep aids and summers are rough. 

Unless someone knows different a sleep study won't help. They don't study or test for the things that cause your insomnia. They will however tell you you have sleep apna and make you buy a machine.

Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,Female 39 years old.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"I'm torn between 

1) ""what if i get a ""you aren't"". 

2) improvements in my life and work 

3) how overly expensive this has the potential to be, given that life costs enough as it is and 

4) just trying to self manage as it is enough to hamper me, but not fully shut me down as others have experienced.

I'm just trying to figure things out and don't know what I am/am not going to do long term. Appreciate the offer though, definitely going to put this post in my back pocket to keep handy though."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,I’m surprised to hear of all these steps and tests. My diagnosis was just a chat and I got prescribed meds. No tests though I have been told to have my blood pressure done at the doctor or a pharmacy regularly.
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Why do GPs need psychiatric permission?

Here in the U.S., at worst a GP requires a neuropsychologist diagnosis; they can manage stimulants without a psychiatrist consultation."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"No sweat, I appreciate the reflection."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,🙏🏾 I anticipated an ADHD term haha. I was about to start obsessing over this new potential fact. Thank you for clarity!
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Hey mate, just thought I’d respond to say that you’re definitely not alone in thinking those points. I actually got diagnosed after my first psychiatrist a fair few years ago said I didn’t have ADHD, it was just my antidepressants weren’t working. Fast forward to now, the new antidepressants didn’t do anything for my symptoms and I finally saw another psychiatrist after both psychologists I saw said they think I have ADHD symptoms.

My partner also recently got diagnosed and he was hung up on the possibility of it not being ADHD and the costs and hurdles involved. But after he got diagnosed he felt a huge wave of relief and got quite emotional.

All this to say when you’re ready and curious, go for it. There’s nothing to lose other than the monetary part but even then I say it’s a worthy gamble to figure it all out. Whatever you decide, wishing you all the best."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Yeah I considered the same for a while, then I came across something that made me feel I was specifically inattentive that I decided to address point 1. Turned out I was correct. But:

1. If you find yourself relating well to anecdotes from people with ADHD, it’s very likely you have it. When I describe what it’s like for me at time to my partner, she can struggle to understand. Explain the same thing to someone who does have ADHD and I’ll get a matching anecdote from them. Once you have the diagnosis though, it’s extremely validating. 

2. It has improved mine significantly. Both at work and at home. I’m far less tired after work, more positive, and more patient. 

3. Yeah it’s not super expensive but that obviously depends on your circumstances. Most expensive single part for me was the psychiatrist, which was about $800. A bit over half was covered by Medicare. Ongoing costs are about $60 per month (Vyvanse + Clonidine) in medication. Impulse spending is down though…

4. That’s exactly where I was. Able to manage so not sure how much difference there would be. Medication isn’t magic, so you still need to manage yourself just not as hard as without. 

Feel free to DM at any point in the future if you need."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"For me, when I went to the place after I got my referral, after a series of meetings and tests they tried to diag me with GAD. At the time I had had severe anxiety related to work and there is the kind of circular symptoms where ADHD can cause anxiety, while anxiety can cause some of the symptoms you may also see under ADHD. So I understood where they were coming from, however in the meeting, I realized what they said didn't make sense as I had had ADHD symptoms before I was having anxiety. I told them so and it was basically ignored (maybe due to them already having had the report done and out at that point). I told them that I agreed to disagree and didn't go back.

At that point, I was mainly going for closure (due to the anxiety) and less the medication, and the whole process cost me a thousand dollars (US) or so, so I didn't feel like it was worth it to go again.

So I would say, go for it, and then see if what they say makes sense. If it doesn't, then you simply disagree (ideally you remember before the end of the diag so that they can take it into account, but we know how likely that is...). You can always spout out on here if you want to get a general sense of what they said if it is something insane or not."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"I'm from the US so I don't know for sure, but it sounds like stimulants may be more controlled there and so there are more steps to get the prescription approved."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"The permission part is the government. The GP provides paperwork, including the psych diagnosis, to support the fact that I have a need for the controlled substance. Once processed, my GP calls in my prescription, which isn’t quite the same as a normal one (technically my Dr isn’t the one issuing it). Instead of the normal scribble on paper, it’s a barcode that gets scanned at the pharmacy. I can take it to any pharmacy, just like a normal prescription. 

I don’t know exactly how it is different, but the paper the Dr gives me has “this is not a prescription” on it. My guess is once scanned, the pharmacy is sent / gets access to the actual prescription."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Thats not an ADHD term lmao 


Relax"
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,Are you using generic vyvanse? Is alot cheaper if you aren't. 
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"Yep it seems to be the case. A few more hoops but after that it’s not difficult. No need to nominate a specific pharmacy or anything to get the medication from. From what I’ve read about the US system, we have a much easier time accessing the medication once prescribed than you do."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"ah I see, it's just controlled substances BS.

if I were a government agency over controlled substances, the only thing I would care about is that \*a\* doctor with whom you established a doctor-patient relationshp wrote the prescription.  Your GP wouldn't need to consult psychiatry, they'd be able to write the script."
Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed”,"No, brand name. It’s $30aud per month for the prescription, but I also have clonidine prescribed to counter blood pressure increase from the vyvanse and to help with sleep which is roughly another $30."

Clonidine for ADHD,Yes it’s great it helps me fall asleep. But I don’t take it every night I take it as needed but if your on an extended release you will probably need it every night :3 It takes about a half hour to kick in. You just feel extra tired but you could power through it if you wanted.
Clonidine for ADHD,I love clonidine. I’m on .2 mg twice a day. It basically is a night and day difference of taking clonidine with Vyvanse or without. It makes me so much more calmer and just gives me the cognitive benefits of ADHD stimulants. It also helps my sleep.
Clonidine for ADHD,"Buy a home blood pressure monitor and check it regularly for the first few weeks you take it. 

I took clonidine for about a month and had to stop because it was causing my blood pressure to skyrocket. 

Clonidine is also used to treat high blood pressure, so my blood pressure would go down a bit when I took it, but then about 12 hours later I would get really bad rebound hypertension.

Of course, everyone's body is different, so you may not have that issue, but you should definitely keep an eye on it! 

It did help my sleep and made me feel a little more relaxed, until it started trying to kill me :)"
Clonidine for ADHD,"I'm prescribed up to 0.3mg in 3 divided doses as needed along with my 30mg per day of Dexamphetamine.

I rarely take the Clonidine during the day, but it's good to know it's there if I feel anxious or over stimmed.

I take it almost every night however, and it helps A LOT with sleep.

No psychoactive effects, but calms me down and stops the racing thoughts. Sometimes if I take it too late at night (1am or so for a 7am wake up) I feel a bit groggy in the morning, but that goes away the moment I have my morning dose of Dex.

If I take it anytime before 11pm for a 7am wake up, I feel very minimal grogginess, if any at all."
Clonidine for ADHD,"I take .3mg every night with my cocktail of other sleeping meds and tbh I can't tell any difference with Clonidine alone, but I have very severe insomnia. I personally don't find it effective for anxiety but I haven't found any meds that help with that yet and I've been on them aaaalll so I think I'm an outlier. Everyone reacts to meds differently so you'll really have to take it to find out. I would just say don't expect overwhelming results, especially on that small of a dose. It’s pretty subtle stuff."
Clonidine for ADHD,"I tried half a 0.1 mg tablet one night before bed and a full 0.1 mg tablet the next night.  It did make me feel tired and may have improved my sleep.  It also made me feel more calm.  I felt a little groggy the morning after I took a full tablet.  And then that afternoon I started feeling off/spacey and dizzy, which might have been a low blood pressure response.  I decided after that I'd rather not take something that affects blood pressure cause of the side effects.  I guess I could try just taking half a tablet again, but yeah, I'm just kind of nervous about unwanted/unneeded effects."
Clonidine for ADHD,It’s a fantastic pain killer to at higher doses. It’s impressive the US is prescribing it.
Clonidine for ADHD,Do you feel it the next day?
Clonidine for ADHD,"That’s awesome, I’m hoping I get similar results. Did you develop a tolerance and had to go up in dose/frequency or did you titrate up to 0.2mg twice a day?"
Clonidine for ADHD,Thanks for the heads up! I’ll be sure to stay on the lookout for any major changes in blood pressure.
Clonidine for ADHD,This is not true
Clonidine for ADHD,"No tolerance, clonidine can be very dependent on your weight. It’s sort of like finding the right stride. I am a bigger guy so I could use a little bit more."
Clonidine for ADHD,"Yes.. it is… https://www.medcentral.com/meds/pain/what-evidence-support-clonidine-adjuvant-analgesic

Google it, Clonidine pain relief"
Clonidine for ADHD,"Got it, that makes sense"
Clonidine for ADHD,"“At higher doses” is not correct. And it being a “fantastic pain killer” is not correct. Did you even read the article you posted? Also saying you’re impressed the US even prescribes it is unnecessary fear mongering that is based in literally zero evidence.

Clonidine is a very safe and effective medication with a relatively benign side effect profile."

Pharmacy won’t refill my clonidine :’),"Are you just going by the system or is staff at the pharmacy telling you it's too soon to fill? The cvs system says my son's clonidine (and other) prescriptions are too soon to fill every few months. I have to call and explain that there must be an error with the system and give them the date it was last filled and how many days the rx was for. They then, after looking it up and agreeing, submit the refill manually. 

I will say that this happens far less often now that I've switched to a cvs inside a target. For whatever that's worth."
Pharmacy won’t refill my clonidine :’),"Was the Rx prn (""take as needed"") or scheduled? If it was prn, that may be why they won't refill it - some pharmacists are super anal about that. Can you call your doctor and speak with them or their nurse/medical assistant?  Sometimes that makes refill requests go through faster.
Also, have you spoken to CVS in person? Sometimes that helps too, they can troubleshoot better"
Pharmacy won’t refill my clonidine :’),Check the cash prices.... It's super cheap even for 90 days. My wife's 90 day supply for 18ish bucks. Locations and pharmacies may differ
Pharmacy won’t refill my clonidine :’),What’s the cash price?? I can’t imagine it’s a whole lot.
Pharmacy won’t refill my clonidine :’),"The pharmacy could have put the incorrect day supply in on the August script, or likely it could have been filled then put back (sometimes we don’t know how or why this happens) and still shows the next refill date. Ask them to run it and show you the actual insurance rejection, that can uncover some more details to figure out why it won’t fill.

Source: I’m a pharmacist with CVS and our system really sucks some days. Even worse when you get a person not willing to investigate and see why things aren’t working but get the right person and they can help you!"
Pharmacy won’t refill my clonidine :’),"Can you call your doctor and have them send it elsewhere? Or does your insurance require you to only use CVS? As someone who deals with pharmacies on a daily basis due to my job, I will say that I have had nothing but poor experiences with CVS. You cannot even speak to a human any longer if you have to call at most of their locations 🫠 I would see if your doctor can send it to a local pharmacy that is not a huge chain, or even somewhere like Costco (you don’t have to be a member to use their pharmacy) as, in my own experiences, they have been more pleasant and helpful. If you have to pay without insurance, clonidine should be pretty affordable through GoodRX!"
Pharmacy won’t refill my clonidine :’),"Yikes, sounds like a nightmare. Maybe see if your doc can send a note to the pharmacy to help push it through? I had a similar issue once, and getting a note expedited the whole mess with insurance. Hang in there, teaching while sleep-deprived is no joke."
Pharmacy won’t refill my clonidine :’),Ask them for the last fill date they have in their system and check the days supply listed on your bottle. It's entirely possible that the instructions don't match the days supply they put in. It's also possible they screwed up and filled it for someone else.
Pharmacy won’t refill my clonidine :’),"Pharmacy should print your last script and read it to explain why they're messing with your quality of life, career and mental health. 
I'm pretty serious level ADHD and I have only had to debate once (calmly and courteously) that my doctors have made these prescriptions based on years, and a plethora of appointments, please take it up with the dr, and not me. Then offer to reach out to regulating authority about having a prescription shorted and held from you."
Pharmacy won’t refill my clonidine :’),"CVS says this to me almost every month on at least one of my meds (via online refill request). I go in and speak to the pharmacist and they roll root eyes like “yeah right” then magically…they say “oh, we can have that ready in 15 mins”. I wish I were joking. Go in and speak to someone in person and I bet it’ll be fine"
Pharmacy won’t refill my clonidine :’),Stop taking too many. If you ran out a month and a half ago you aren’t taking them as prescribed. Some people abuse clonidine so pharmacies and doctors keep an eye on it the same way they do muscle relaxers.
Pharmacy won’t refill my clonidine :’),[deleted]
Pharmacy won’t refill my clonidine :’),I want to add to try to go in and talk to them in person at a time when they’re not super busy if you can. First of all their new phone robot is THE WORST and also I just feel like I usually get better results that way.
Pharmacy won’t refill my clonidine :’),"CVS in Target is the way to go! Things are so so so much better in a target, and people are nicer!"
Pharmacy won’t refill my clonidine :’),".2mg x 30 is about $14 retail. Can be even cheaper with something like goodrx. 

They really shouldn’t be toying with a blood pressure medication…"
Pharmacy won’t refill my clonidine :’),Um what? This is a fairly mundane combination. It’s probably methylphenidate extended release plus afternoon bridge dose to keep the crash from being bad and keep function in evening and then clonidine for impulsivity/executive function/sleep.

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I'm still not amazing and don't sleep until pretty late at night, but the thing that helped me loads is podcasts on a sleep timer! They are fantastic. If I don't have that my mind will go a mile a minute and before I know it I check my phone in frustration to find I've spent two hours in bed with my anxieties and am arguably further from sleeping so decide to play on my phone.  

The solution for me is a 45 minute sleep timer on a podcast, I just close my eyes, enjoy the podcast and let my mind stfu for the first time all day."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Exhaustion.

I do 10k steps in the morning and an hour of VR exercise in the evening.

5/7 days, it even works."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I am seeing this at 5 AM, so I kind of think we all just don't. Especially if you take medicine :')"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Non-medication:  Exercise outdoors during daylight. Spending as much time as possible outside during daylight.  Showering right before bed, the temperature drop afterwards can trigger sleepiness.  Eating an early dinner and then no more food until the next day.  Completely cut out all caffeine.  Get into bed with podcast on, preferably a boring one.  Meditation (body scans, breathing exercises) while lying in bed if I'm not sleepy yet.  Get up after 45 mins if I'm not drifting off yet, but no stimulating activities, no screens or books.  I just sort of sit around and twiddle my thumbs, continue the boring podcast, write in my journal, plan the day tomorrow, process the day just past.  More meditation maybe.

Medication:  Trazodone"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,I either fall immediately into a coma or I lay in the darkness tossing and turning... pondering every mistake I have EVER made.. every awkward encounter.  there is no middle ground.

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I am extremely militant about my sleep schedule, so I make sure I go to sleep at the time I need to get 8 hrs ( I work a job where my schedule changes over the week , so it's never the same time). Chamomile, sleep aids, podcasts, shows, YouTube videos are all tools I use. It depends on my mood, but most of the time I listen to a calming podcast on a sleep timer. Right now I have been listening to Sleep and Sorcery. It starts with a guided meditation and then goes into a story. Night Falls is the same just different story type and one has a feminine voice and the other a masculine. Other than that, routines are , as always, the greatest tools when trying to sleep. Especially hard for adhd people , and varies from person to person. My partner has to set an alarm to tell him to start getting ready to sleep anf he does all the things that I do, but still has a rough go of it. Sometimes just doing the same thing every night can really help, along with some OTC sleep aids. My mother in law can't sleep without prescription sleep aids though. Everyone is different so trying to experiment can be frustrating, but don't be hard on yourself if something isn't working. Just see the process through until you find some combination that works for you."

How the fuck do you guys sleep,I would say: how do you guys wake up
How the fuck do you guys sleep,When I get tired. I've tried almost everything and nothing seems to work. I get on average 1 - 2 hrs of sleep at night. I don't nap. Every other month I go into hibernation mode one day for 17-18hrs of uninterrupted sleep. It's a vicious cycle really but I've been doing this most of my adult life.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"The hard truth is exercise. Very strenuous exercise. I hate it more than anything, but I'm in the gym 3 or 4 times a week. It helps you sleep and reduces symptoms a boat load. Aerobic is most important in my experience. I run a mile as fast as I can and then do sprints. Then I do bench,  squats, arms and pull ups. This is the only way I can get to sleep. If I slack off I start only being able to sleep 4 hours a night and am perpetually exhausted."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I’ve had to stick to a really strict sleep schedule. It’s very sensitive. So even staying up late one time will mess up the whole thing. 

I aim for 5.5-6 hours a night. Thats enough to function well at work without feeling emotionally tired. I know that’s less than the recommended but it’s a hell of a lot more than what I used to get. Weekends I’ll sleep some extra hours but i never sleep past 8AM (cause it’ll mess up the schedule)."

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Do you also enjoy sleeping in? I have traditionally had both a hard time getting myself to go to bed, then a hard time getting up in the morning. I recently came up with a paradigm shift that had really helped. My brain loves sleeping in, so I can trick it by convincing it that I'm not ""going to bed early"", which it doesn't want to do, I'm really ""starting to sleep in right now"", which it loves. Something about ""hey brain, let's go sleep in! You love that shit!"" just hits different and is much easier to pull off in the evenings."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,[removed]
How the fuck do you guys sleep,So for me the number one thing that fixed my sleep was a schedule I stick to every day. I get up at the same time and I go to bed at the same time every day Monday-Sunday.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Starting wanting to go to sleep helped alot actually. I burned out, was miserable, got sick easily and realised that I needed to get the base right before doing all the extra oomp I wanted to do.

I still have periods of revenge bedtime procrastination but after years of training to have a sleep routine it has started to get easier and I have learned to identify when my sleep window is open. Before I never felt my sleep window, just thought I was hungry and pushed through. Oh, meds probably helped alot to, because I wasn't so constantly brain overwhelmed/tired so I was more able to feel the difference. Small dose Melatonin helped to learn to identify the feeling of sleepiness also.

Things I do to sleep, drink coffee, look and listen to let's plays of sims or skyrim from DrGluon or Gopher on Twitch or youtube all through the night. Must look first, just audio doesn't help."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Try meditating or taking your self to a place that makes you happy. Just go to bed and settle yourself down then slowly count down from 100, counting as you breath out slowly. Every time your thoughts stray - start again. Do not give up.

Or Imagine money was no object, where would you live, what would your life be like, what would you do all day, focus on things that would make you happy - just focus on happy thoughts. It takes practice but you need to focus only on things that make you happy."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"You have to stay in a routine. Wake up early, work out, be generally healthy. Get exercise regularly. Wind down routine and then lol turn on the tv and watch till passed out. Usually some disc golf or something that is mildly interesting but I watch a lot of.

I want to try listening to a podcast in the dark or something like that. Fans help with noise. Black out curtains. Try to put phone down early. Note paper near the bed, incase an idea strikes. 

Officially diagnosed, early, w delayed phase sleep blah blah blah. Meds never worked great, cause I’d power through if not fully tired. Went driving on ambien a few times, holy shit that’s scary, had to stop that shit. 

Take it easy on yourself and don’t add to the pressure."

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"It’s so easy for me to adapt bad sleep habits, because I’m so prone to listening to music, playing games, looking at porn. 

But for me, when I wrap myself up in my comfiest blankets like a cocoon, wear socks and pajamas to keep my warm, the build up of heat rocks me to sleep, and I exhaust my mind fantasizing about an anime fantasy video game world I could make up, either the stories in it, the design, or the game mechanics, etc. It does have to be like mid to low 70s inside or else it gets too hot and doesn’t work though."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Every person is different, so you want to find what will work for YOU. 

So there are a ton of tips here that may or may not help you. You'll want to try different things, as well as a combination of things. 


But a big thing for ADHD people is an inability to 'calm' our minds. Which can and does make sleep difficult. I've had the same problem with insomnia in the past for exactly this reason. 


So you want to do two things in general. The first is preparation. Which is where the recommendations for exercise, sleep schedules, et al come in. Make sure you *will* be tired when you go to bed. It helps!


The second is to push your mind to let go when you are actually attempting to sleep. Which is where the recommendations for podcasts, ASMR, meds, et al come in. 


If your mind is running, then it won't allow you to sleep. So a means of distraction to calm it down helps enormously. Some type of 'focus' ironically allows your mind to relax into sleep since one thing is easier to handle than many things. 


The rule for these are two fold. You want something relatively calming. NO action movies. Documentaries or the like. Audio is better than video for most. But you also want something that will keep your focus. It has to be interesting. Too boring means you won't pay attention and will tune it out. That WON'T put you to sleep! I find astronomy cool. It keeps my attention until it doesn't. ;-) 

I've got a subscription to [Curiosity](https://curiositystream.com) for exactly this reason. It''s my nightly ritual. And it works. Probably won't work for you, but that's ok. Find your own interest and use it."

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"By doing polyphasic sleep and meditation.

Getting more time in my day usually helps me be more satisfied too.

How the fuck do you guys sleep,Something that helps me: ASMR. I saw something on this sub that suggested it in place of meditation. It relaxes me so much. Check out ASMR Twix or Semisidse for a relaxing experience.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Poorly!
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I have learned to get ready for better before I am sleepy due to I learned if I wait to get ready for bed when I am tired the act of doing my night time routine will make me push through the tiredness and then my brain goes into ""oh, we aren't sleeping okay let me go into overdrive.""

I kind of think of my brain as a toddler, need to put the toddler down for a nap when tired because of they miss that window of tiredness and push through it then you will never get them to calm down.


I also listen to the same podcast as I do my nighttime stuff to signal to my brain it's sleepy time. 

I also do a sleep mask and ear plugs. The eye mask helps because I would be laying down but my eyes would be open and I wouldn't even know it because I would be in my head. So it forces me to close my eyes, similar with the ear plugs it forces me to not listen to every tiny sound."

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Audio book and complete darkness. Works well if you create a mental image of the book’s universe for you to traverse and eventually you just fall asleep.

Otherwise install a high pressure pneumatic piston with a boxing glove on it and have it knock you out before bed, works a treat."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I stopped drinking caffeine and that helped majorly with sleeping, but my I also lost my ability to focus so I have mixed feelings about it."

How the fuck do you guys sleep,ASMR & weed.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Tons of weed. I HAVE to wake up early for work so I HAVE to go to bed early. I try to force my body follow schedules whether it likes it or not. 

I only smoke at night because weed does slow me down and I’ll feel useless during the day if I don’t feel like I accomplished enough. 

But for night time- amazing. I wake up for work at 5:45 everyday so I NEED to go to be at 10 but naturally I can’t. Two bowls from the Studenglass and I’m asleep like a rock till my alarm goes. 


( funny enough I was using weed for other health issues and this just happened to be a side benefit- and for those like - oh melatonin blah blah- it interacts with my meds so this is the only thing me and my psychiatrist can agree on for sleep since bendrayl and ambien is a slippery slope )"

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I sleep at 3 - 5AM, if I try to go to bed any earlier I can't sleep, so it's a waste of time.

If I have to get up at 8 AM my options are to ""go to bed at 11 and pretend to sleep for 8 hours"" or go to bed at 3 and operate on 4-5 hours of sleep.

Realistically the first one is more responsible, but it's just horrible lying there awake when you can just sleep instantly when you go to bed later."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"The “already ruined it” thing is an illusion, more sleep will pretty much always be better. Convincing yourself of that is the hard part imo, but once you do you might find it easier to catch yourself up late and put down whatever you’re doing. There’s a sleep technique where you just lay there and focus on taking the same breaths in and out with you eyes closed that actually kinda helped me, but you have to want to fall asleep in the first place which was the real challenge"

Apparently caffeine can affect certain people waaaaay more than others. Now I am able to fall asleep with 15 minutes of closing my eyes. Try it out. I hope it works."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I have a whole arsenal - here are the steps to my going to sleep routine:

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"One thing I did was : Bed = sleep . And only sleep. I try not to read, watch movies, work, eat, or anything apart from sleeping in my bed. That way I get sleepy mor easily. I also try to be in bed as soon as I get the heavy sleepy eyes."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Sleeping is an ongoing battle for me but if I look back on times when I have had it under control I would say the big things to remember are these.

If you are stimulated and don't feel tired at 11 you probably won't feel tired until it is way too late, we're talking 3 or 4 and for any normal job/schedule that is way too late. Waiting until you feel tired just isn't viable most of the time.

Anxiety can make you feel as though you can make things better by using this time, whether you are catching up on productivity or self-care, but most of the time you are just putting off the acceptance that the day is over and you are as prepared as you are going to be for tomorrow. In most cases at 1am I might be in a better state to finish some work or enjoy some gaming than I would be in the morning but the lack of sleep will inevitably build up and affect my work day which just snowballs time debt and creates more anxiety."

I regularly allow for 7+ hours of sleep but I rarely get over 5. I can’t find anything that will specifically help me from waking up too early. I have a toddler and this morning was my day to sleep in and I woke up before 6 (which is technically is sleeping in I guess since I’m usually awake around 5).
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I have solved this problem by trial and error. which is what i recommend u guys. I listen to youtube, not watch listen. I choose something that is mildly interesting for me, like i can engage myself into keep listening, more importantly start listening. Starting is the most important part here. And somewhere within 20 to 60 min I'll fall asleep while listening. I dont try to sleep,jus close my eyes and keep listening and let go. At some point i'll fall asleep.

1. After a certain time, usually 10 am, if I haven’t taken my meds, I don’t take them. I just don’t want to risk staying up late.

2. I have a bed time. Unless we (my wife and I) are specifically out on a date, or with friends, we are in bed by 9, and asleep by 10. This is also accompanied by a wind down routine.

3. (I haven’t tried this one but friends have) working out in the evening. They say it tires them out.

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I started putting on standup comedy so I could close my eyes and listen. It was nice to chuckle a bit before I passed out. 
I'm unmedicated. I do martial arts, so intense workouts that use a lot of brain power. I don't know if it helps me sleep any, but I feel like I am locked in my head all day, and when I am in a strenuous workout, I'm in my body.
I stopped drinking. Once I leave my bed at 630 - 7am, I never get back into it until bedtime, so it is only associated with sleep. If I nap, I nap on the floor (I love it.) If I eat a lot of carbs or sugar before bed, I will get really hot and feel almost hungover in the morning.

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I know this sounds counterintuitive, but I slept so much better once I started taking stimulants.

It can't be so boring that it's completely unstimulating, but can't be entertaining enough to actually grab my attention. Get in that range and I sleep like a baby after peacefully listening for like four minutes.

History Channel, true crime podcasts, and my boyfriend playing Fire Emblem Engage have been my recent go-to's."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Genuine answer: reduce screen time before bed and do something non digital for an hour. For me, it's reading.

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"The only way I can get to sleep before 1am is by putting a 1-2 hour YouTube video on and turning my phone over so the room stays dark. Same concept as reading a kid a story as they fall asleep. Just keep your toddler-brain engaged enough and it'll hopefully drift off on its own.

Pick a relaxed video that doesn't have a lot of jarring spikes in volume that might jolt you awake but where the narration/sound effects keeps your mind just engaged enough that it doesn't go racing off in 40 different directions. Lore/movie explanation videos tend to be good candidates but something that isn't so ""interesting"" that you'll pay enough attention to stay awake."

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"What helped me and honestly changed the game for me: after dinner, I dim the lights to a minimum. Also got one of those projectors that cast pastel light, but I’m mostly in the dark. 

If your lamps are too bright, put something on top to make it darker. This will help trick your brain into thinking it’s later than it is and prep for bedtime.

Also avoid doing things that make your mind race, and opt for doing more mellow sort of stuff. It wasn’t easy in the beginning for me, but it’s def a habit sort of thing and now it very rarely fails me! 

Speaking of habit - going to bed at the same time helps too"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I'm usually sleeping in 1-5 minutes, I used to go days without sleep when I was younger but I found mentally picturing things I find peaceful/unlikely to rile me up (like driving my car or something) has me snoozing very quickly. Its very hard to focus on it, though, as my imagination can run rampant most bedtimes.

I still have intermittent nights where I need to give up attempting to sleep and go play my computer or something. I usually wake up, head smushed into my desk on those nights, but they are few and far between now, thankfully.

I hope you find what works for you quickly."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Exhaustion.

Not sure if I can recommend it as a cure, but having kids worked for me...

I'm a very light sleeper and my wife is the opposite. We've got two small children and for the first ~2 years I was awake multiple times per night with one of them and then again early in the mornings.

Eventually I was so tired I would just go straight to sleep when I got into bed. It was a pretty novel experience for me when it first started happening (I've had trouble getting to sleep my entire life), but now I've either learnt how to just go to sleep or I'm constantly exhausted enough that it's not a problem 😂

The other thing this taught me was the importance of sleep. I'm so useless without a half decent night sleep that I really have to make an effort to get into bed early enough at night to compensate for the early mornings (thankfully both the kids generally sleep through the night now).

It might sound odd, but I also think starting meds helped.  By bedtime I feel like throughout the day I've already managed to work through the kind of thoughts that used to keep me up because I'm more focused generally.

I've still got a lot of work to do to improve this part of my coping strategy, but nowadays I believe that sleep might be one of the things that has the single largest impact on my ability to function (regardless of meds). The other two things I want to focus on next are exercise and diet."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I take clonidine for sleep every night. Sometimes it isn’t so effect. So then I would take DAYVIGO, which worked like a charm for me. Sadly, I no longer have access to it. Now, I take otc unisom in addition with the clonidine."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I have had terrible insomnia side effects from Vyvanse, on top of my sleep issues that were happening before I started those meds. I just started taking Clonidine at night and it has been a game changer. I’ve slept more in the last two nights than I have in the last week!"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"It’s so hard… my career choices led me to a job where it’s either night shift or days both go 7-7 for 12 hours. Home life dictated I work 7a-7p. I have had to come up with a nightly “ritual.” Phone alarm at 9p tells me I have an hour to go to bed. I walk the dog (15 min), take a melatonin & Benadryl, wash it down with a non-alcoholic beer (for the hops, they are a mild sedative) and then try to have something with casein protein either a glass of milk or Greek yogurt (15 min). Then I read a book made of paper, not my iPad or iPhone for the remaining time (30 min) until I put in some earplugs and a nigh mask on and hopefully get to sleep. Usually works pretty well, but sometimes not. I also embrace the middle of the night wake up when I go get another glass of milk and have a granola bar or a spoonful of peanut butter… I go right back to sleep if I embrace it, if I fight it, I’m awake till dawn.

Oh, but I could sleep in every god damn morning regardless of how much or how little sleep I got the night before."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,I listen to audiobooks or podcasts while in bed. I make myself close my eyes and focus on the story. A really good podcast is Nothing Much Happens. It's a lady with a calm voice reading stories. Focusing on the stories helps me block out my own thoughts so I can sleep. I've been doing it since I was a kid. :)
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Trazadone and watching Cracking the Cryptic
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Melatonin, Chamomile tea, and no more screen time after 11pm. Should be asleep by 12. Before super demanding work days, screens of by 930pm.

Also weighted blanket"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I had similar issues in my early 20's and it wasn't until I had to set myself to a strict bedtime of 11pm, was I able to fall asleep regularly and stay asleep.

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Doxylamine.

It finally came about a month ago and I’m obsessed with it. I have never experienced such good sleep in my LIFE. I kid you not, it took me 3-4 hours to fall asleep every night. Now I’m out in less than 15 minutes. I don’t know if it’s magic or whatever but it’s been totally life changing for me. It’s a pretty penny (somewhere around $250 I believe?) but damn is it worth every cent. Cannot recommend enough."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Whether or not I'm exercising dictates if I'm going to sleep on time. If I'm exercising 3 days a week that means I'll get to sleep all week on time, so it's not like I need to wear myself out every day. The flip side of that is true too. If I don't exercise for weeks and I do for one day, that doesn't fix the problem. It needs to be a routine. That's how it works for me at least.

I'll also mention that I take Adderall and drink a coffee or energy drink every day too"

But I also have to wake up at 7am. And also take sertaline for depression. Idk if that's relevant but my sleep schedule improved with meds and work that has a consistent schedule, too?

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Hi there! Hi there! i’m here! 

hah. Yeah. hi! 

It’s possible to sleep regular hours with an ADHD brain, but you do have to want to. As in. You gotta keep trying hard and refining the kill strategy. And the payoff is absolutely worth it. 

The book ADHD 2.0 (Hallowell) mentions sleep for ADHD brains as INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. 

As in. Sleep is absolutely neccessary for our ADHD brains to function at our best. And it affects our mood too and energy, way more than it affects NT folks. 

Getting good sleep WILL change your life, esp if you’re like me and have been sleeping shittily my entire life and just thinking im stupid and lazy and just experiencing depression all the time. 

Yeah. So I quit caffeine (sigh it has such a terrible effect on me - like when i already had bad sleep, and then i blast myself with caffeine or meds, and then i’m even more exhausted after the caffeine crash, and then vicious cycle that never ends)

And then I force-slept. As in. I tried A LOT of the techniques that worked for people on this sub, in other threads asking for sleep help. I spent like a month going through all of them. 

I tried different sleep podcasts. I like Sleep Cove, actually. 

I tried this sleep meditation recommended by my friend who has ADHD. It’s so boring that i absolutely nodded off lol. You gotta get recommendations from ADHD folks, not just any sleep meditation. 

I listened to this “Extremely Heavy Rain Pouring” white nose. It’s an app called “White Noise” with a pink logo. Free. Love that sound haha. 

AND. I ALSO PAIRED THE ABOVE with a very HIGH CLASS sleep mask haha. It’s sort of like spongy memory foam? SO comfortable and light (doesn’t press on my face). And blocks out 100% of light!!!!!!! 

So I really feel different when wearing it, plus with the heavy rain pouring sound in my airpods. MAN. It’s such a trip. like being in a lil cave by myself. it’s pretty epic. Really amazing experience. Luxurious. I’m never getting on a plane without it from now on. Sleep anywhere, man. 

I’m 36 years old and man, what a game-changer all of this stuff is. Been living my life never thinking that i could try different things to see if I can sleep better. I tried lots of things and FAILED. But kept going! And then i finally found stuff that worked, so I can have a better life. Kinda life hacking my life. 

You’ll also notice that bad sleep begets bad sleep. So if you have bad sleep, you’re going to find it even harder to fall asleep the next day. and you might have to do a force-sleep plus give yourself early bedtime. (I sleep trained my baby and the sleep principles are the absolute same. It works. Good sleep begets good sleep and vice versa. If you have a sleep debt and are exhausted all the time, then you need to sleep MORE in order to get back to a good sleep routine.) 

The right amount of sleep for you is when you wake up naturally, without an alarm, and wake up feeling refreshed. (From the ADHD 2.0 book by Hallowell) 

Lol. What a joke. Before I started all of this sleep forcing, the last time that ever happened with my ADHD brain was probably when i was 10 years old or something.

And ALSOOO did you know that when you are sleepy you should try to sleep and not continue to fiddle with your phone :/ because the “sleepiness” and “awakeness” comes in cycles!! so if you miss the “sleepiness window” you are doomed for that night… well maybe you’ll be sleepy again 2-3 hours later 

But my dudes. THIS STUFF. Is so good. When you sleep well. It’s amazing."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,what time do you wake up? when I had to get up at 7 for work I fell asleep much easier than i do when I get up at 10-11 on the weekends
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"It's still a struggle but what's been working for me lately is: 

No social media / stimulating entertainment in bed (usually I watch this stuff in the living room until I start getting ready for bed.)  
Melatonin and Magnesium glycinate  
I wear nose tubes to sleep. I am a mouth breather and realised sleeping with my mouth open was not good sleep at all. I found these silicone nose tubes on Amazon, but before that I was using Breathe Right nasal strips which work really well.  
Putting on a sleepy music / meditation music playlist  
Having a fan on  
Read dull / boring stuff in bed with the blue light filter on my phone, or a book (usually my phone)  
When I start to get sleepy, turn off the lights and count backwards from 100 as I focus on my breathing (learned this one from a similar thread here.)"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Something I saw recently is to take melatonin 2-3 hours before you want to go to bed. I’ve been doing that and it makes you so tired that around that time you do fall asleep
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"After trying sleeping tablets and anti-histamines for the insomnia (both prescribed), I ended up on cannabis due to the side effects I was getting on the other medication.

How the fuck do you guys sleep,I have noticed that I sleep a lot easier by a combination of lifting my legs in bed and autogenic training
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Same here. Last night I stayed up until at least 3 a.m. So if I really want to sleep I have two options:
* for whatever reason when I’m in bed, I usually put my phone beside me on the floor and look down on it when I want to use it rather than holding it in my hand and that gets really tiring. So I can tire myself out that way and that usually works pretty well
* I just force myself to sleep when it’s time but then I usually lay there for at least two more hours just trying to sleep so that’s usually not very effective"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Just woke up it’s almost 3pm, I couldnt sleep until 6am"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"try taking a caffeine pill 1/2 hour before going to bed.

it can help some people with ADHD as it is similar to meds."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Routine and discipline. I know, duh, it's not something you can just start doing as someone with ADHD. But let me explain my situation and what I do.

I work daytime Monday-Friday, that alone kind of forces me to have a sleeping routine already. I also like my job and care about clocking in on time so that helps. 

I've convinced my brain to *want* to get into bed at a good time. Because I just know how bad it will suck to get up in the morning if I only sleep 5 hours. Find out how much you need to sleep in order to have an easier time waking up and stick to that. I need around 7 and a half hours personally.

I always re-set my alarm shortly before bed so I see the ""The alarm will ring in X hours and Y minutes starting now"" pop-up. It helps me to see exactly in how many hours I need to wake up. If it says less than 8 hours I feel a strong need to go to sleep. 

If you do not have anything that you need to wake up for every morning, and face no immediate consequences for sleeping in/staying up, decide a time you want to wake up every day and stick to it.

The only one that expects you to not go to bed at 3am is you, if you want to feel more energized and take care of yourself sleep schedule is a big one. Getting good sleep is self-care.

Exercise helps a ton to get tired in the evenings. 

Try to eat dinner at a reasonable time. 

Try to reduce screen time before bed. At least of things that requires your attention, personally I get sleepy from watching long YouTube videos, like podcasts, video essays and educational videos.

Read a chapter of a book you like every night to wind down your head before sleeping.

Drink tea, not coffee."

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I think about fantasy worlds. My own canon of universes from video games, manga, anime, tv shows as I keep my eyes close. I lean into thinking and at some point, I wake up hours later."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Sleep problems are super common with adhd - i had some kind of delayed skeep / circadian rhythm disorder for a long time where my body wanted to sleep from 4 am to like 11, which is terrible when you have to be up for school or work at 6. I've had the best luck with cannabis or melatonin. Never tried both at the same time, but note that melatonin tends to increase rem sleep and cannabis tends to reduce it. Or at least reduce dream recall, so take those things into account depending on how you feel about dreaming. Both will enhance deep sleep though, which is the stuff you need for cognitive recovery, especially as someone with executive function issues.

Antihistamines like benadryl and muscle relaxers also knock me out, but then I'm useless the next day."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I have a Google home setup, and it gives me reminders every 30 minutes from 7:30-9pm, and a sleep for Android QR code by my toothbrush and an alarm for 9:01 pm

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I follow a few simple rules that help me. 

1. No phone in bed. Ever. I have my charger at the other side of the room so I have to plug in my phone and can’t reach it while in bed. It also helps with waking up. 

2. Get a smart light. I use [this](https://casper.com/ca/en/accessories/glow.html), the way it will automatically dim over 45 minutes helps me fall asleep, it also has a cool wake up mode.

3. Books. Reading is great because it gives my mind something to focus on and not let me run wild, but it’s not a screen with bright pixels. I use an ereader with a backlight set to 1% so I can read even if I’m up past the smart lights 45 minutes. 

4.  A smart speaker. For those nights where I really can’t sleep, I’ll play a guided meditation or a podcast episode (normally the sweet vocal notes of Roman Mars) the smart speaker is key because it lets you play audio without looking at a screen, which absolutely hurts everything. 


The biggest part of this that works is being away from my phone, the pixels absolutely fuck your brain up in a way that makes it hard to sleep. With the book, the dimming lights, I eventually just find my eyes getting tired and I fall asleep. 

I also find sometimes I’ll get lost in my own thoughts because of what I’m reading, but because it’s so dark already I think and close my eyes, but then sleep. 

It’s also important to not beat yourself up for not sleeping, but just focus on creating good conditions for sleep and it will come."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I listen to ""The No Sleep Podcast"", or any creepy podcast at all really works like a charm for me. I usually put my head on the pillow, turn it on, make sure my alarm is set for tomorrow, then I wake up refreshed in the morning.  
 Heck, I'm so conditioned now that when I went to see NoSleep Live, I only got through half of it before I was snoring happily on my friends shoulder.  
Picked up the habit back when I was putting my kids to bed when they were little. I had one on each shoulder, read them a bedtime story, then had to stay there until they were  
sleeping, which could take a while. Boooring. Which got me listening to podcasts in headphones until. 

Of course I fell asleep most of the time because I was trying to stay awake to have some grown up time afterwards. And the habit stuck."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,My normal bedtime is between midnight and 3:00 a.m. although sometimes I go all the way till 6:00 a.m. I'm able to sleep much more consistently now that I have a partner with me.

This trick helped my sleep immensely. Unfortunately some stuff happened and I feel out of the habit after about 8 months but I'm gonna get back into it this summer.

Also, if you're drinking caffeine, stop doing that around 6-8 hours before bedtime. I know it's essential for us but even though we process it differently it WILL fuck up our sleep. Good luck!"

I found it really strange when I started taking Elvanse and it fixed my sleep, like how can a stimulant fix my sleep?

I think it's more that without medication I'm perpetually tired and like a zombie because nothing gives me enough interest or get up and go to actually do anything- which makes me feel like I've wasted my day and I need to carry on doing nothing for as long as I can.

But on medication I actually feel alive and awake and manage to get things done- and doing things makes me tired enough to sleep at the right time."

2. I get in bed by 11pm
3. No phone in bed, only sex or sleep
4. Close my eyes once laying down, and use mental exercises to bag up thoughts I don't want into a garbage bag (you draw a garbage bag around a key concept mentally) and then toss it into a dumpster. It took time and repeating the mental dumpster as many times as it needs to stop thinking about it. It works like a charm.

Im not great at it, Im with you brother, the worst shit in the world is the counting down hours and hours til you have to get up and anxiety and rising pressure type of shit trying to sleep. 

When I was working out more it did help, but some of it was removing a bit of that anxiety of 'I have this to do and that and tomorrow and and and'. Some of it is just having a schedule. I definitely find I kind of have to be in bed doing shit for a while because even if Im like yawning tired, after Ive finished brushing my teeth and shit, getting up and getting the bed ready kinda gets my mind going again. 

I also find having some sort of external noise to focus on can keep me out of my head,and Ive always been one to sleep with the tv on for some reason, even with sound off, so Im one of those people who will put on youtube videos or something. If you sleep with someone thats probably a non starter though."

edit: i have ""reading"" (small correction) glasses with blue light filter, 11kg 2-person weighted blanket (i'm 60kg and i sleep alone, the size means i'm always covered and i can fold it temporarily in case i'm feeling awful, some kind of anxiety attack or whatever), the most affordable melatonin without prescription (not reimbursed) at 1,9mg (2mg and above requires prescription), alarms to remind me to go to bed, a ""habit tracker"" for the tasks i generally need to do before going to be so that i don't get sidetracked while going to bed. i use the public radio app (Radio France) to listen to a science podcast/class from the Collège de France. Jean-Jacques Hublin is remarkably sleep-inducing x) there's a useful timer included in the app. ""automation"" on my old iphone allows me to set my phone to switch off the wifi and put airplane mode at midnight"

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"ever since I got medicated my sleep issues have gone away. a year of bupropion, and now almost a year of Vyvanse, and getting my ass out of my computer chair late at night is still an issue, but I can get to sleep no problem. it’s kind of fantastic"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I’d love to know the secret to! I take sleep meds at 10, in bed by 12, still awake at 4:30-5am, sometimes 5:30am. Every night it’s like this. I’m on two different kinds of sleep meds, been to therapy for relaxation techniques, tried every strategy in the book. Haven’t found anything that helps. My sleep schedule is so out of whack"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,I had a sleep mask with speakers in it. I listen to stories on the Better Sleep app. I’ve been listening to the history of tea for 2 weeks because I can’t get though more than 10 minutes if it. Lol
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Necessary preparations:
- if my body is too restless I do a short workout (dancing, pushups, whatever)
- I usually watch a movie/series before bed to calm my mind. If that‘s too boring: I read a book.
- I never (when possible) stay up until after midnight because then I‘m overtired and way too excited 

-Then I just lie in bed and imagine a story. That gives my thoughts something to focus on and I don‘t think about sleeping anymore but just enjoy lying in bed and then I‘m pretty fast asleep 

(Disclaimer: I’m not diagnosed, but free tips are free tips, right?)"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,I just bought an eye mask/Bluetooth headphone combo. I’ve been looking forward to going to bed to listen to my book each night. I average about ten minutes it seems since I have to run my book back each day 😂
How the fuck do you guys sleep,What do you mean your body isn’t a slave to its internal schedule?  9:30pm rolls around and I will sleep wherever I am parked until 6am.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I find it really helps to lower my stimulation level and get ready for sleep by lowering light levels in my house and putting on ambient music. My blood pressure goes down and everything, and then, when I do get in bed, I do need to relax and fall asleep but it's much easier if I do that first. Good luck and hope this maybe helps."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Listen to a stream, as I find I need some sort of stimulation to keep my brain from going brrr.

Also, edibles. I'm not generally much for recreational smoking, but I find if I take an edible before I sleep I'm actually able to sleep through the night, fall asleep faster, and am less tired the next day. I know it's not for everyone, and I was a bit on the fence, but it's genuinely been a godsend"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I sometimes have problems doing this. What I do is at some point I just get in bed and lay there. I don’t get on my phone, just me myself and I laying there waiting to fall asleep"

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"My dad is the same way, I'm the opposite. Getting to sleep is usually fine for me, it's waking up that's so difficult. I could have so much time during the day but I just can't wake up, I always choose more sleep.  Some people have suggested taking my Focalin in the morning on the first alarm but I haven't tried it yet"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"No tips to getting to sleep on time, but have a suggestion for sleeping - my partner always plays a podcast when he sleeps and it auto turns off in 15 mins. I noticed that I slept way faster and better at his and I would never recall what the podcast said after the first few minutes 

He later linked me to this YouTube video he stumbled upon about a psychiatrist talking about ADHD patients and that this is something used for ADHD patients to fall asleep and how it works"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I’ve developed a routine over the years that’s slowly programmed me to fall asleep within 10 minutes; naturally if I deviate from it in any way, the routine stops and I start over from the top. 

Stretching while listening to calm music (especially sciatic/back stretches) then when I’m in bed all the lights go off, I turn on sleep sounds with a 30 minute timer (I use BetterSleep, it’s got a good variety of free sounds and they adjust volumes throughout the playtime so it doesn’t get monotonous), curl up to my left side and boom, snoozetown. 

Some things that have made it easier are making sure to stop eating about 2-3 hours to digest eaten food before you sleep, drink water leading up to night night time, and reading before you go to bed vs staring at a screen. I set focus mode to go on at 11:30 PM and it blocks all social media/dopamine scrolling for the night. 

Hopefully some of this helps you all!"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"...Poorly, lol."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Benedryll
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"but yeah, as soon as it’s necessary to stay up all night/I’ve committed to the all nighter I immediately get sleepy!

I think it’s some thing about feeling forced to do something, and then my brain tries to force the opposite very defiantly.

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I used to run consistently and beautiful sleep schedule. 10PM zzz

6am awakeeee

But COVID. Mental health went Boop 

Physical health went wheee"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I HAVE to run myself ragged at the gym. I’ve been working out consistently for a year and it seems to help.  Also all that research into eating right and stuff.  Low carbs mean low energy.  Also not eating past 7pm so I don’t have energy into the evening with a light meal (mainly protein dense) I’m also unmedicated and trying to raw dog life with moderate/ sometimes severe ADHD.

I used to smoke weed but that was a crutch I wanted to stop using, and sometimes it did the opposite of make me tired, so now I’m just leaning in to be a gym rat.  Basically if I don’t use all my energy, I will feel awful.  

I also think the food relationship is important too.  If you eat a lot of carbs, you will have excess energy.  Maybe try a diet that focuses on protein, that type of energy is slow burning and won’t help aid the anxiety driven ADHD moments like sugar and bread might.  These are just personal experiences that I’ve noticed with diet change.

Also, what some people have said about music or podcasts is good.  I usually just like an easy-going cartoon like bobs burgers.  Usually gets me to stop thinking.

So basically all around just try to be as healthy as possible and see where you are in a couple months.  It the long, slow, difficult, delayed gratification method, but I’m really happy even though I’m still scrolling Reddit for an hour when I wanted to get work done this morning.   

Okay… putting down the phone now…."

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"If I’m doing something interesting fuck sleep. If I’m not, then I need to watch videos on my kindle in bed to fall asleep."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I've struggled to fall asleep my entire life. Quieting down the mind takes much longer than I'd prefer. I'd wager that 5/7 nights in the past year, barring a week here or there, I've eaten some portion of a 10 mg THC edible to fall asleep. 

That's much more than I've invested on average across my adult life, but it's become ""do you want to fall asleep 30 mins after you get in bed or two to three hours?"" I eat it like 2 to 3 hours before I want to go to sleep. That may not be the right answer for everyone, but for me it's become that simple binary choice.

Also, I've noticed that I can fall asleep in no time at all on my couch compared to our bed. That's not ideal for my fiancee though. Overall it's a continued struggle."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"This guy: https://m.youtube.com/@JohnMichaelGodier

How the fuck do you guys sleep,You gotta have doubtless determination and some ego to play as
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Exercise. Use your energy and you will sleep better
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Weed. It shuts my brain right TF up
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Melatonin.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I'm sorry to say but this doesn't seem like an ADHD thing. You need to be disciplined. 

The proof is in ""oh well I'm already up late I might as well""

That ""might as well"" is nothing more than an excuse. You have done better and you can do better again.

If you want to reset yourself. Wake up early no matter how little sleep. Then that day you wake up you'll be really tired and you can wait until it's the bed time you want and boom you're fixed"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Get up at the same time every day, even if you haven't slept. I don't care if i got 2 hours of sleep and have a hangover, i'm getting up at 8, no matter what. 

The only exception is when i'm sick, because i need sleep to get better."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I put my headphones in and listen to old audiobooks of books I’ve read a million times. My usual are the Harry potters, Percy Jackson’s, maze runners, and hunger games. It has to be content I know inside and out or else I’ll stay interested and won’t sleep, but also not something I’m not interested in at all because that’s boring."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I have made up my own private island. The place is self-sustainable so there are many aspects to the island. 
Whenever I cant fall asleep I go to the island and I start naming everything that the island contains (like different types of crops, fruittrees, lifestock and other agricultural stuff) whenever i find my mind wandering off, I have to start again. I usually dont make it to the village, but if I do, i list all the trades that are needed there. I have never made it beyond that. 
The fact that I have to get up early also makes that I go to bed early enough, so the body can rest at least, even if I dont sleep."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Weed. How is weed not the top answer
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"i don’t hang out in my bed anymore, ever, so if i’m in there my body sorta knows it’s time to sleep. when i used to spend time in my bed before sleeping or during the day it definitely made it harder to sleep when i actually tried to go to bed at night. when i had roommates years ago and hung out in my room all the time it was harder to sleep at night since i would “go to bed” wayyy earlier than when i actually was trying to sleep. 

now that i hang out in other parts of the apartment before bed, my body naturally winds down when i go to my room. 

i also take edibles if i really can’t sleep."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I had this problem my entire life, and what helped me immensely was melatonin. It actually makes me feel sleepy, but not in a medicinal sleep aid kind of way. I had to find the right balance, but it has been a life changer."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Podcasts and I take a 10mg Adderall. For reasons that makes sense to me, I find the Adderall helps me fall asleep or even nap. Likely because my dopamine levels are raised and my focus less jumpy."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Reading posts like this makes me blessed.  I swear all my aunts and uncles have ADHD and they all struggle with sleeping.  My mum is a zombie most days.  I got diagnosed at 40 never had trouble sleeping in my life (except when I went on ADHD meds which I subsequently stopped).

I feel for all of you having trouble sleeping."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"For me, the gym is very important for my sleep. I go in the morning so I don’t have time to get distracted, and because if I go at night, I’ll be even more awake."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,5 hrs at a time
How the fuck do you guys sleep,I'm not a guy
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Go to sleep while stimulants are in effect.  Once they begin to taper I tend to have fatigue for about 1 hour or so.  If I don’t sleep by then it’s over.  My brain takes over and I’be got 3-4hours of sleep in the mail
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"For me podcasts are nice, but not having a device close by is great as well. I try to limit myself to a kindle, so when my head can't stop and calm down I'll pick up (an interesting) book and read to break whatever loop is going on in my head. The drawback is that if the book is too interesting, I'll be up until 6AM or something, but it's better than what my mind does awake at night without input."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Magnesium Glycinate - take it at night (I try to take it 30-60 minutes before bed). It's helped me with quantity and quality of sleep.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Ugh this is the worst problem in my life. I saw a sleep doctor. I tried a bunch of medications. Some things that sort of help:

- No caffeine after 1 or 2
- No Adderall after 1 or 2 
- Wake up and the same time every day no matter how little you slept. Blast your eyeballs with sunlight immediately for at least 15 mins
- even better to go outside right after waking up 
- don’t look at your phone or watch tv in bed
- make your room dark and cool
- sleep in a separate room from your partner if they move or snore
- look into CBTi which is basically cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. 
- don’t lay in bed trying to sleep. Get up if you’re awake and do something like read"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I'm a high maintenance sleeper. I absolutely NEED white noise and a cooler environment to get any sleep. I would use an oscillating fan ever since I was young. If I ever go anywhere, I make sure I have headphones and I download a white noise app to help me.

Also getting a window AC has been a life saver."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Trazodone 💕
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I workout six days a week, and at night take an over the counter sleeping pill, L-Theanine, and Magnesium Glycinate"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I can’t sleep without working out. I have to pump those meds out eod. Vitamins also help flush them out. Key is to flush the meds out, any anti-depressant will only mask what’s already in the system, and will only disrupt your sleep."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,I used to sleep maybe 3hrs… now I take one toke of the magic green .. just one.. and it settles me in for the night
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"My current sleep schedule is waking up at 4-6pm and going to bed at 7-9am. It sucks. And the only reason I stay up so late is because I wake up so late, so it feels like a waste of a day to go to bed early. It's a brutal cycle.

I managed to fix my sleeping pattern recently, but only for like 2 days, and then I stayed up really late again because I just don't get tired, and now my sleeping schedule is back to being really bad again.   


When I go to bed I always have videos playing on my TV. It can't be boring videos that I don't find interesting, though. It needs to be videos that I can listen to and still find engaging, that way while I'm trying to get to sleep, it still feels like I'm doing something productive and keeping my mind engaged. It's a double edged sword though, because sometimes I find the videos too interesting and I find myself actually watching them instead of trying to get to sleep.   
But I find that keeping my mind engaged whilst trying to get to sleep helps me get to sleep, which is weird, most people would say to not stimulate your brain too much before/whilst getting to sleep, but for me it's the opposite, I need the stimulation otherwise my mind is going a million miles an hour thinking about all these different things which makes it near impossible to sleep."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Melatonin. That's the only thing that puts me to sleep, I take it every night. I dont notice I need to increase my dosage at all, and it's been years. There are some types that don't work as well for me, such as the dual release - but that's about it. 

It knocks me out within about an hour 95% of the time."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,I don’t know. I sleep four hours a night. Broken up. I try to get naps in during the day but it’s nearly impossible.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Reposting an edited version of my original comment:

Step 1: high vis/volume alarm on my phone to end screentime.

Step 2: medication. I was prescribed Trazodone (a very well documented SSRI) a while back and boy howdy is it a game changer. As always, talk to your doctor about meds!

[Edited to remove information regarding OTC supplements. Feel free to DM with questions!]

Step 3: calm/low engagement activity for like 30 minutes while step 2 activates. Chill podcast + crochet works really well for me personally, but any simple, repetitive task that doesn't require much if any decision making should be fine.

Step 4: heavy weighted blanket + some nice ambient music. Lately that's been Ludovico Einaudi's Seven Days Walking album(s). Beautiful low-drama piano.

I don't always manage to follow all of these, but when I do I have VERY noticeable improvement in my sleep quality. My baseline is 5-7 hours of shallow sleep (waking up and drifting off multiple times) after ~2 hours of ruminating (read: lying awake trying to get my brain to shut up). If I follow all 4 I've probably had as little as 30 minutes of ruminating and noticeably deeper sleep.

I hope at least some of this helps. Good luck."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,I make edibles with RSO (Rick Simpson oil). For the most part they help me sleep better than I’ve slept in years. Not even ambien worked for me.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Cannabis helps me immensely, but I know that's not possible or legal for everyone. I smoke it for my anxiety and pain and I take a few edibles right before bed which makes me sleepy and also helps with my nightmares. If you're curious about trying it, go for ""indica"" strains and take it slow at first because cannabis can cause paranoia if you're not prepared or experienced. If you've never tried cannabis before then try it on a night when you don't have to get up early the next morning, just in case it messes with you."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I have a way to turn off my thoughts, and focus on my breathing, until it lulls me to sleep  Even if I drink coffee or in bouts of panic attack, I am able to fall asleep with this method.

The hardest days to fall asleep were if I fell in love and I just realized it. But so far it's been easy."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I tend to watch YouTube in bed but find it keeps me up more often than not. What I've been doing the past few years is turning on an audio book that I've already listened to with a sleep timer. I still watch YouTube but at about 2am, sometimes sooner, I'll turn the book on.

The audio book I listen to is Ready Player One (read by Will Wheaton.) I've listened to at least a dozen (or three) times by now. It's currently my favorite. Occasionally, I'll put on Ready Player Two but find I get more distracted by the story as I've not listened to it as much.

I've tried other books but find I can't zone out as much because I'm too interested in the story. I don't think podcasts would work for me because they're ""new"" and my brain wants to stay engaged.

I've tried nature sounds (thunderstorms, rain, ocean, jungle, crickets, ect) but they don't calm me the same as a book. I think a book requires just enough brain processing power that I don't think as much when it's playing. Does that make sense? 

This allows me to close my eyes and 85% of the time I'll fall asleep before the 30 minute sleep timer is up. If I don't, I'll turn it back on for another 20-30 minutes.

Oh, I also listen to it at the lowest possible volume level. Just enough so I can understand the words. When it's louder it keeps me awake longer."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I have a physical job and I train for powerlifting and I have a dog that needs walking.

I maintain my bedroom and bed ready for sleep - bed made, sheets clean, bedroom clean (the rest of my place is a mess though).

After dinner (7:00) I get ready for bed - shower, brush/floss in the shower, put on pj’s.

I then avoid anything interactive - participating in social media, playing video games, etc.

I keep lighting very dim.

When I start to fall asleep while watching tv, I go to bed and put on a podcast that shuts off when the episode is over.  The podcast keeps my mind from switching channels thousands of times and thinking too much."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"It’s weird, but I like to sweep the floors or vacuum before bed. Doing anything that’s on my “always to-do list” helps. +Melatonin every night."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,One word: melatonin
How the fuck do you guys sleep,I stop caffeine by 10am. And I take trazadone 150 and hydroxizine 50 at night
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Along with exercise earlier in the day, no alcohol or caffeine before bed, drinking water an hour before and not right before bedtime, and wearing a sleep mask (recommend Manta), I'm now playing this on a little bluetooth speaker next to the bed. It helps A LOT.

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I use timed lights. They’re color changing and I have them set to turn to cozy mood lighting around 9pm, and then they slowly fade until they turn off at midnight.

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Podcasts, video essay, game/movie reviews + sleep timer. I use newpipe to download videos for offline use, and any sleep timer app works"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Hot lemon balm tea works for me.  The thing is, going out to the store to get lemon balm tea doesn't work, because lemon balm was used as a flavoring and not an active ingredient.  I use non-caffeinated tea and actual lemon balm leaves, ground up or torn up, and pour the tea over them.

It's also amazing for anxiety!  It helps me get through interviews, too."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"1. I have a fan blowing at my face constantly. I love a combination of the warm blankets, a cold nose, and the noise.

2. Sleepy music. If I can point my brain to something to focus on while the rest of my body shuts down, it's much easier to get to sleep without my brain constantly wandering.

3. Sun lamp by my bedside. Fun psychology fact: the best way to set your circadian rhythm is to get as much bright light entering your eyesduring the first hour of awakeness. Bedroom lights don't cut it. It has to be bright. Science™ has proven that this is actually one of only two physiological responses that the body has to sunlight. The other being the metabolism of vitamin D in the skin. Bright light hitting your eyeballs in the first hour after sleep has a direct, causal relationship with setting the start time to your circadian rhythm. So if you do this, your body will naturally get tired at the right times."

Since Covid, I've not had to commute, so going to sleep at 2am hasn't been a problem, socialising was right out, so having an afternoon nap to catch up has been ok.  Biphasic sleep pattern ftw.

Since starting on Elvanse, I've been getting to sleep with no problem at 11pm... and then waking at 3am.  It's weird, but within the bounds of manageable."

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Hi! Had adhd all my life, and I work first shift (5am) almost every day and I normally go to bed around 8pm to try to get enough sleep. 

For proper bedtime, my best advice is thinking during the day “I’ve only got x hours until 7”(hour of wind down time). If I think it whenever I see a clock, it helps me remember to finish whatever I’m distracted with and get ready for bed. 

Most important is a proper routine for bed. I’m an avid tea drinker, and my favorites for bed time are Bedtime by Yogi and comforting chamomile also by yogi (yes I combine them). 

I also use blackout curtains, as I can’t sleep unless by body can be aligned with its circadian rhythm. If it’s completely dark (no small lights from electronics, black electrical tape is great!), then my mind is much more accepting of sleep. 

As for the “two stimuli at once” my mind often desires, I try (unfortunately not that successfully) to limit screens and opt for white noise scenes from my bedroom echo or a bedtime story from YouTube. 

White noise helps me a lot, so the sleep sound by sleep jar (Alexa skill) is perfect. I also have a fan, dehumidifier (my room is a little too humid) and air purifier all provide lovely white noise!

Hope this helps!"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,I watch [Cracking the Cryptic](https://www.youtube.com/@CrackingTheCryptic) on YouTube.. Each ruleset is new and it's fun to watch the logical steps happen. Trying to follow along gives me something to focus on. The only downside is I get mad in the mornings because I didn't see how it ended...
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I struggle with very bad insomnia and have to take medication for it, so I’m sorry that I don’t have any advice for you OP.

For those of you who are wondering, I take a medication called Ramelteon for my insomnia, some days it works, some days it doesn’t. I also am on other medications for the other issues that I have that I don’t want to list right now."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I take 60mg Vyvanse, and have been since high school. During my late teens, I discovered 2 Benadryl & 5mg Melatonin did the trick. I started taking that exact combo every night between 8-10pm. After a while, I started taking 1 & 1/2 Benadryl + melatonin, then it was just 1 Benadryl, and now I don’t take Benadryl unless I have allergies and it’s bedtime - I however cannot seem to lower my melatonin dosage."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Get on meds. Sometimes I miss the insanity of my mind. These days it’s all to quite up there. But I get more done. And I’m not tired all day and buzzed all night.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Not the best advise, but… bourbon. Not a glass. Not a shot. Not even a whole sip. I rarely drink even a whole beer so my tolerance is low. Right before bed I'll take the tiniest sip.(only on rare nights that I NEED to be really well rested the next day. Instantly makes me really relaxed and sleepy. Favorite is Old Forester 1920."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Seroquel
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Exercise is the right answer.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I find working out 6 days a week, eating healthy and staying overall active gives me deep uninterrupted sleep. Especially after burning 600-900 calories a day."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I have trouble sleeping too, no matter how tired I am.  I've begun listening to asmr videos of people reading books, sometimes it's meditation sounds/music on youtube.  Old episodes of the joy of painting works too.  And I just saw a YouTube video on this by a psychiatrist, she said warm the body acouple of hours before you intend to go to sleep, so like taking a warm bath, drinking tea (decaf, of course)"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"It's hard sometimes, but all the usual stuff about a good diet and exercise is true.

I also sometimes self-medicate with cannabis gummies (which are legal where I live; obviously if you're a minor or live in a place where cannabis is illegal this may be advice you can't use). Small dose, so I just get kinda relaxed but not super stoned."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Imo it sounds more like your attitude of ""well I may as well stay up more"". My weight loss coach tells me to avoid that mindset when I have cake or pizza that ""well I might as well keep going since I already made a mistake"" and just allow yourself that slip up and continue to prepare for sleep just bc you are up late."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I imagine painting a (part of a) wall with a small paintbrush, or coloring a piece of computer paper with a fat crayola marker. 
I take my time, and don’t leave any spaces between strokes. 
It’s very easy to calm my mind this way, and I fall asleep easily. 
It works way better for me than the whole “relax your body one muscle group at a time” - because that sure as hell has never worked"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I used to do the same and have been using this video. I’ve never made it to the end. Just make sure to put it in a playlist by itself so it doesn’t play random stuff after. 

https://youtu.be/ROzhPtg-91g"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"The only times I've been able to easily go to sleep have been when I physically exert myself a lot during the day.  Getting a lot of sunshine also helps, even if just walking or doing something not very physical.

I usually have a fan or tell my google home to play rain sounds or ocean sounds.  It is *soooo* hard for me to sleep without some background noise.  Rain sounds are soothing to me, enough that I need to for sure stop them in the morning to help me wake up.

It also helps a lot to put on some kind of lengthy audio story or meditative thing.  Alan Watts is somehow super interesting when I'm awake, but if I listen to his recordings at night it helps wind down (even more if it's some new-age-y channel that adds meditative music to it, lol).

I think it helps to have things that you've listened to before so they aren't *that* interesting, but are complex/detailed enough that you can listen again without getting too bored.  Just last night I was listening to an english translation of the Diamond Sutra that I've listened to many times, and I can't even recall making it past the first minute, lol.  But I did do a lot of walking out in the sun yesterday.

The trick is not getting sucked into a youtube rabbit hole before you find the video you want, lol."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Magnesium glycinate has been really helpful for me. It used to take me 2-3 hours to fall asleep and I would toss & turn. Now I sleep like a rock after 30 min max. YMMV
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"This is the only way for me (and I’m starting to hate it). 
I go lay in bed around 9pm, phone on focus and greyscale on, watching tv. I will fall asleep between 22:30-23:30

If I go lay in bed later, I will fall asleep later."

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Sleep headphones with something mildly interesting playing.  Like a mildly interesting podcast, or an audiobook of a story I’ve already read."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Melatonin plus Clonidine. Takes out the whole “be your best self” mental discipline BS from the equation. I have to wear a mask and have air blasted down my throat (CPAP) for sleep apnoea, so I figure I’m just going to make it simple. Night time is way better for focus (for me) so I tend to work on stuff right to bedtime, not great for overactive brains or getting ready to sleep based on what all the ads are pushing at me… lol"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Becoming a housewife and having a full-time job made me sleep earlier because I got exhausted. Plus my job depletes my social interaction bar every single day.

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"https://sleepopolis.com/calculators/sleep/ helps when I've stayed up too late to give me an idea of when to (try to) fall asleep so I'm not entirely dead in the morning. 

Gummies, Melatonin, a shower, white noise, piano music, nature noises. I can't do podcasts or anything with words because it doesn't shut me off, it wakes me up. Also a cold room and a very fluffy blanket are a requirement 😂"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Literally about to try a 21 day prescription of melatonin 2mg along with Elvanse 40mg (increased from 30mg) - Will give an update if there’s any changes!
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Vigorous exercise is the only thing that has ever worked for me, get yourself too tired to want anything BUT sleep"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,I've tried everything from melatonin to hydroxizine. I have 5 different sleep aids in my cabinet and the one thing that's worked is low dose indica thc gummies. Of course I live in ohio and have a drug test at the end of the month so needless to say I haven't really slept in 2 weeks now but that's just how it goes I guess lol
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Ironically adhd meds shut my mind up and I can sleep at 9 with them even though they are stimulant

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Simple, I stay awake until I can’t. Is it safe to be driving an hour to work each day on 4-5 hours sleep, no. Do I recommend this strategy, no."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"valerian root, melatonin gummies at like 6 pm, putting on a slightly interesting but slightly boring youtube video on, cold temperature room"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I take a hilarious number of supplements to sleep. I used to take Ambien, and god bless that stuff, but eventually you stop going to sleep on it and start staying up to do weird shit. Like eat everything in the house. Can’t do it anymore. 

Now, I take melissa lemon balm, magnesium gummies, a melatonin gummy, jujube fruit, GABA, and glycine. Any one of them would not be enough, but with their powers combined, eventually the sleepy will come. But I also have to set myself up for success to not miss that window of sleepiness by getting into bed in a dark room with a fan on for white noise while I wait for it to work. 

I do still scroll on my phone or tablet until I get tired, but with a blue light filter on to keep the brightness down. Or if you have an iPad, you have to go into the accessibility part of the settings, to Display & Text Size, and then turn down white point. Works like a charm."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,I use melatonin and a couple other sedating meds in low doses and it helps me disconnect even if I’m on my phone (amitryptiline and sometimes hydroxyzine)
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I notice that if it's a busy day then I'm able to fall asleep really quickly because I feel like passing out. But if it isn't a busy day then I just daydream and that helps my brain to keep busy even though I'm trying to go to sleep. 

I also recommend trying to put any devices and screens away an hour before going to bed and doing other things to help calm down but also to help exhaust you before going to bed. 

(Random but if I take caffeine I will fall asleep soon after so something I do that towards the evening just to help kick my brain into gear. )

(I don't take medication specifically for ADHD since my doctor never did so but next week I'm hoping to see if I can get some or do more evals to see what I have that I can work on.)"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Melatonin 3 hours before I wanna be asleep, Cannabis an hour-two hours before I wanna be asleep (legal state) and orgasm. Tends to put me out for a good nights sleep. This will not help everyone who tries it, but that’s my pretty close to surefire way of falling asleep lol"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Have you tried Melatonin? also there’s a supplement called CALM ( it’s magnesium) my son is the same exact way and has the same issues when it comes to sleep, he’s on clonidine and CALM and he says the CALM makes a huge difference."

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I've always had delayed sleep phase issues, and since I can't work and have nothing I want to do in the days so I just sleep all day, AND the only alone time I get at home is after 11pm when my partner goes to bed, so I stay up until after 3am every night (aka, morning) but really, if I'm in bed before 4.30am, that's a bonus.

I take an antihistamine so I can get to sleep and stay asleep."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"when i can't fall asleep i get up and do 15minutes of high intensity cardio(jump rope and burpes) then lay down while my heart rate is still up. works most of the time, cut my sleepless nights in half.

when my schedule gets pushed back from staying up i'll jump start an early bedtime with melatonin and a stiff drink."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Skill issue
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Melatonin 1 hour before bedtime. 60% of the time it works…every time.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"For me, its half of an OTC sleeping pill, a bedtime routine that stays the same every night, my ac unit blasting cold air at me 3 seasons of the year, the ac unit also doubles as a sound machine, weighted blanket, pillow under my head and another over my face with a small gap for me to breathe, blackout curtains, and doing puzzles on my phone at the lowest screen brightness setting until I get bored/tired enough to fall asleep.

Sometimes a hot bath or shower just before bed helps too. Especially in the winter. Even though I like my room cold to sleep. Probably because my extremeties are bad at circulation and it makes my body the same temperature when I’m trying to sleep. Its harder to sleep when my feet are significantly colder than the rest of me.

I also avoid social media once I’m in bed despite having my phone. I turn airplane mode on so I can only do offline stuff like puzzles. I turn airplane mode off once I put my phone down for the night in case I get a call or something in the morning. My phone is on do not disturb at night until a reasonable enough hour in the morning so that even if someone calls I’m not woken up until after 8am or 9am on days I don’t have to be up earlier than that."

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Get a schedule and stick to it. Get up at the same time every day and go to bed, lights out, at the same time every day. No coffee after noon. No screens 5 hrs before sleep. Avoid sugar and get exercise every day. 

It takes weeks of practice but it works. Audiobooks keep me awake, listening to them."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I go through periods where I don't sleep much. I'm a night owl anyway and if I don't have to be somewhere the next day I get off-schedule very easily.

I find that I sleep better on the sofa than in bed. And I usually have something playing on Netflix or have some videos playing on my laptop. Video is key for me (not just audio). A TV show or movie - that I've seen a million times already - quietly playing in the background will distract my brain enough for me to realize how tired I really am."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Most of the time (without meds, alco and drugs) I sleep every second day. Or I sleep for 20h and then Im awake for 24-30h.   


Sleeping is hard, specially with nightmares from trauma.   


I push shit ton of caffeine into my bloodstream everyday, so when I got tired after those 30h I just drop dead into the bed."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I think it really varies from person to person. I *had* to delete FB and tickety tock from my phone bc ""just one more video"" is dangerous right before bed. That worked well until the you tubes introduced ""shorts""... I'd be on there looking for spooky stories to fall asleep to (those with a Bluetooth headband headphones = near instant sleep), and get distracted by the stupid shorts. It wasn't bad when I used to cast YT to my TV because you can't cast shorts. But I switched to the headphones when I got new loud neighbors and don't have that built in barrier now."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Sun lamp 30 minutes when I wake up. I’m told it helps shift the body’s melatonin production to nighttime to help get properly tired, and it does feel that way to me."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Currently I can only sleep laying on my right side with my head between 2 pillows and focusing on my breathing while counting to ten slowly 1 number for each breath saying the number inside my head and holding it until I finish so 1 holding as I inhale then 2 holding as I exhale I have to hold the number so no random thoughts can work their way in
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Lots and lots of medication.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Get off your f*cking phone, there is actually a psychological phenomenon called sleep procrastination and its mostly because of excessive phone use. Especially social media is designed to keep you on the app.

Some solutions:

Delete the app causing the excessive use (you don'tneed it 99% of the tome anyway)

Limit your app time

Set a sleepmode most phones allow a sleepmode where the screen turns black&white to discourage phone use."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Get wasted physically. Exercise til you drop
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Sounds like this was written by me lol. My sleep is awful but I’ve been working on it a lot recently with my therapist and doctor.   I find whatever trick I figure out my body adapts too.  

I don’t want to take sleep meds and weed doesn’t help as much as it used to, but my doctor did prescribe me amitriptalyine which has helped a little with the getting my self sleepier at night.  Trying to take it consistently at 6pm and I get tired enough to sleep by midnight. I also take a shower every night. Not a full shower but what I call therapy shower.  All lights out lay in the tub with hot water running on me. I also wear AirPods. I usually feel like this wave feeling when I do that.  Then I get out dry off and jump into bed with AirPods still in. I usually pass out within 10 minutes after that.  

Doubt it would work for everyone but it works for me. Related to a way I coped with trauma as a child so prob why it works for me so well."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Bold of you to assume I sleep 😅 

But I'm sorry to say I have no great advice but I'll be scrolling the comments for tips lol.   I'm starting a second medication at night (guanfacine, tonight will be the first time) which I hope helps but I don't have high expectations."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"https://www.lifeextension.com/vitamins-supplements/item02502/rest-renew

This stuff really works and you don’t need a prescription for it. It takes a couple weeks for your body to adjust to it but it’s a more natural approach to sleep aids than prescribed sleep drugs."

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"100 million grams of sweet, juicy, rich, buttery quetiapine fumarate. or something 

literally cannot sleep without it. and I hate that I can't. it doesn't even do anything except allow me to fall asleep. I once had to go 4 days without it because CVS and my doctors office kept fuckin up and not doing anything and it was the worst. had to overcome my social anxiety and be ""that"" customer (without being a dick about it because I know it's not the person on the phones fault). in the end I had to get my parents to call in a favor since one of their friends is close friends with someone at the clinic. ugh."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"i didn't sleep until i started taking melatonin, now it's so much more easier/faster to sleep. bc of my running thoughts and hyper brain i used to take 2 to 3 hours to sleep and always get up in the middle of the night 1 to 3 times and  now i almost never do that!!! yeah sometimes but still pretty much better sleep with melatonin"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Not really sure.I have been this way as long as I can remember. I thought it was normal. I personally think it's from a dopamine overload.

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I know Melatonin doesn’t work for a lot of people, but it helps me fall asleep, but if I have it alone, I’ll wake up within two hours.

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Bluetooth sleep mask.
Also wake up early and GO OUTSIDE.
This will start your clock and help you with your rhythm."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Identify things that would make “going to sleep” attractive enough to compete with the other things trying to grab your attention at night and implement them.

If sleep alone does not offer sufficient comfort, would an upgrade to your pillows/mattress help? Are there any rituals you can implement that would make “getting to sleep” less of an on/off proposition, so you can ease into sleep, rather than having it be a hard wall for activity?

Much of my improvement over the past year has been in finding ways to sleep better. Stuffed animals have been helpful; they make sleeping more comfortable, and they occupy my hands so I can’t hold my phone. As a result, my “time to sleep” has dropped dramatically."

How the fuck do you guys sleep,You have to have a good circadian rhythm. Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day are so important. It will make it easier to to get out of bed in the morning and go to bed at night.

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I’ve just gone to work on so little sleep for for long, when I finally did start getting the recommended 8+ hours each night, I never want to go back to how I was lol. 

I make sure to plug in my phone across the room so that I can’t snooze it when my alarm goes off in the morning, it’s literally the ONLY thing that can get me out of bed. It also helps because I’m not doom-scrolling right before bed which makes it easier for my mind to rest. I have a kindle and make to sure to only have that next to my bed because once I read a chapter or two my brain is like “this is boring” and I pass right out😂 lavender/chamomile tea before bed also really helps to relax my body :)

It doesn’t happen perfectly every night of course, but when I do get my shit together before bed, the next day at work feels like a thousand bucks🥰"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"A ton of people mention audiobooks on sleep timer, but they're not the best for me.  The moment I would get interested in the story,  I would be up for a new more hours listening to what comes next.  

What I actually recommend is playing a movie or TV shows you know like the back of your hand on low volume.  You can have it play, you don't need to watch to see what's happening you already know what's going to happen next,  but it quiets the mind because you can focus on the audio instead of your thoughts."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I used to use guided meditation to relax enough to fall asleep. I also have ""trained"" myself to fall asleep to certain things.

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Used to go to bed between 4-7am, having to be up at 8am. These days it's around 1am (I'll always be a night owl). These are the two things that worked for me:

Don't do anything but sleep in your bed. Changed the game for me once I stopped watching TV/using my computer or phone in bed. Changing the room I hung out in made a big difference but if that's not possible, just avoid the bed.

Also Xyzal 🤷🏻‍♀️ (allergy medicine with the little owl), I started taking it nightly for allergies and after 8 years of 1mg Xanax before bed, I stopped taking Xanax completely (other than as needed for anxiety). Makes me very tired but it's not the groggy exhaustion that comes with Benadryl or Atarax though. I also take gabapentin for nerve issues, that may help my case a bit too. A balance of routine and the right medication definitely helped me, now if I could just make waking up easier..."

If I can't fall asleep in a half hour I get up and do something not on a screen for 10 minutes away from my bedroom, then try again. Also the occasional benadryl if i really really can't sleep."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"> How the fuck do you guys sleep

Oh, that's *easy*

> I can never go to sleep on time

Oh. I think I misunderstood your request. As you were...

(only half joking)

The somewhat more serious answer is a combination of all the normal sleep hygiene recommendations (if you haven't already heard that advice 1001 times, then just google ""sleep hygiene"") plus *tHis OnE wiErD TRICK THaT SoMnolOGIsTs HAte*: Get up on time *every day* (even days off, sorry)

For this to work well, you should get physically active and in good strong daylight as soon after you get up as you can. A walk to the corner shop to get a snack is a good start on that front, or just doing some mindless house work with all the lights on and curtains open if that feels like a bit much for first thing. Also eat good hearty breakfast. These things give your body and brain a good strong signal that it really is time to get up, rather than time for another lovely nap / lie-in.

I also recommend taking your pills as soon as the alarm goes off to take advantage of the ""side effect"" of stimulants waking you up :-P

You'll probably find that the first couple of days are really hard work because you got to bed *far* too late to get enough sleep by the time your alarm goes off, but this really is the most powerful single thing to reset your body clock, and that really is the only way to persuade it it's bedtime when the clock says so...

This is one reason why being unemployed is such a shitty situation for me (and I suspect for ADHDers in general) I *need* the routine of a job to keep my body clock in bounds. Even a long weekend leaves me heading rapidly toward a freewheeling ad-hoc polyphasic shambles of a sleep ""pattern"" :-/ I've some times wondered if I actually have a bona fide sleep disorder, but once I'm in a good routine (a few weeks of regular waking times) I actually get to the point of waking up *spontaneously* at about the right time(!) so I suspect not."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,It varies. Usually exercise gets me enough feel good hormones to get myself to bed on time. I exercise in the evening then ride the high until bedtime. I cannot follow a schedule if I don’t exercise. Sometimes I will have some romantic time with myself in place of exercise and that usually knocks me out afterwards 🥴🫡😉
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Exercise regularly, have a sleep schedule and stick to it, and when I go to bed I put the TV on a sleep timer to distract my brain before I go to sleep.

Oh, and drugs. I find it helps me go to sleep if I get stoned before bed."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"IDK i suffer from bedtime procrastination 7 years deferring going to sleep even 500+ times hours till 3-8AM... I still struggle with it, I hate time before sleep I get so bored and in bad mood and hate to have make decision going to bad and hate to falling sleep, because I have deviated nasal septum and before I have 20 ideas every second... I hate falling sleep so much it was 10/10 torture for me years and i had tons of other issues i couldn't even do anything about it is like you have 10/10 pain you forgot about, because you are suffering from 15, 17 and 20/10 pains..."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"medication helps me get up on time, for one thing. If I manage that, I can workout in the morning and will be tired by evening (or already in the afternoon). 

I also picked up ""breathing"" meditation to do right before bed for a while. I don't do it anymore, cause it became irritating to me, but it did train my brain to associate things like turning off the computer and lights with going to bed, so those things make me feel sleepy now.
(It also helps when you have something like a cream/lotion/… you put on right before bed to make your brain associate the smell with sleeping tbh).

But honestly, my main tip is to just tire yourself out, or set an alarm for a time you want to go to bed and then do that ASAP. finish what you are doing if you must and then just go."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Medication (trazodone in my case) and the 10-hour white noise/black screen video on YouTube.

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"For me, a podcast or longform YouTube thing that I'm interested in, but not invested in, so I don't care if I fall asleep during it. Using Bluetooth headphones I can sleep in, I can drift off with structured noise that keeps me engaged enough to not spin out. 

About an hour before bed I some melatonin, and that usually has me pretty sleepy. I don't like down for bed though until I'm almost too tired to stand. If I go to bed too early, I wake up and go down an internet wormhole.

For what it's worth, at night I also take an antipsychotic for an intrusive thought disorder, which usually makes me pretty tired. I don't have the ""typical"" ADHD sleeping experience partly because of taking that."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"As a kid a would often be unable to sleep because I was so frustrated that I couldn't sleep. The big thing that helped me was thinking of it less as ""I need to be sleeping right now!"" and instead treating it as time I can relax and sorta day dream, which often leads seamlessly into actual dreaming"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Seems like most people with ADHD at my pharmacy use melatonin, it's highly prescribed. I use it too and it seems to work a treat. I also am one of those annoying people that seems to have success sleeping if my meds are still ""active"" as methylphenidate seems to be a sleeping aid for me lol, my first time taking it I was about 3 hours in and my body basically could not seem to do anything else and just crashed out, I had the best sleep of my life thanks to a stimulant."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"A routine. I don't spend any time in my bedroom unless I'm going to sleep, my body knows when I go in there, its bed time. I listen to specific podcasts when I'm going to sleep. Blue blocking glasses helped too."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"2am is my target sleep time…

I usually have an espresso right before bed to relax and slow down the ideas.  Keep the thread of a daydream going and off to sleep."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Most of the time I keep going until I'm tired.  Get a super comfortable mattress, lay down when you're tired and you will fall asleep. Bits not instantaneous.  Be patient."

Used to be up till 6 am regularly so I started sleep meds. Helped a lot"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Drugs
How the fuck do you guys sleep,my sleep disorders are so inconsistent I can't manage the same way from week to week. I could sleep if I smoked weed but it affects other things and fucks up my dopamine. I have a sleep study finally in June but I don't learn the results until August lol. took me almost 2 years of trying to get the study tho. I quit weed again 2 weeks ago and the next day couldn't get to sleep until 5am and spent every night getting about 5 hours of sleep. it's really hard on my brain and my body.

How the fuck do you guys sleep,Xanax or melatonin helps me. If not I can't sleep no matter how tired I am.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,i have the same tv show on every night at a volume just loud enough that i have to be still to hear it. I also do my best to have it play all night.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Melatonin, 5 mg an hour before bed. And routine (yeah I know it sucks that it actually works)"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Not something i would recommend obviously because adhd medication can disrupt sleep more for some, i guess anyway, but just that it helps me sleep oddly and i think it might because the stimulant effect is less than the internal dialogue that will keep me awake much longer."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Asmr, depending on what kind of sounds you like. It’s so relaxing for me that I get so tired and literally can’t keep my eyes open. I also hyper focus on the sounds and tend not to think as much, otherwise I’d be thinking a mile a minute and unable to relax at all"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,This is also me to a t. I appreciate all the suggestions.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Unisom and boring tv shows
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I started taking melatonin 6 hours before bed. It’s just enough to push me into sleep when I need to and once you’re on the rhythm it seems to help. That being said, if you force yourself to stay up it eventually stops working, I find. 


I have narcolepsy also, and cause it can’t be a simple condition it fucks with both restfulness as well as wakefulness, so I have insomnia as well. It’s the one thing that I feel does absolutely anything that’s not a crazy intense medication."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I make sure to take my meds rly early in the morning so by the time they wear off I get pretty tired. I also love listening to audiobooks on a slower speed, they always help me fall asleep (but just be sure it’s a book where you don’t  super care about the plot, I find children’s books and classics to be the best to listen to.) I also like the podcast Get Sleepy, they read you a nice relaxing story and the narrators have very relaxing voices."

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"This works for me if I'm in just the right kind of restless, but i do NOT recommend it if you aren't sure how it will effect you if you're tired but can't sleep: I have an energy drink. Most nights I wouldn't date, but every once in a while it's just what I need and puts me out like a light."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Lower your dose. You’re tweaking.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"This may sound weird, but video games tend to help me. I used to study right up to bed time as I am a university student but I found that made my insomnia worse and worse because it got me thinking more and so the hamster wheel just would keep going and going to the point my doctor said no more study before bed after I was stuck for a week not sleeping. 

For me I play video games before bed which keeps my mind active on a pretty high level so I eventually get super tired and it helps me sleep. But also a routine really helps a lot. I still struggle at times and I have to be careful not to give in to the temptation to stay up super late and a lot of times I do fail but its better than it was."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,I use the sleep/ alarm feature on my iphone so it cues me when its time for “wind down” as my own personal warning to wrap it up. I get in bed like 45 min before I want to sleep cause I know I have the tendency to keep scrolling and getting on a tangent like you said. I also second everyone who said podcast or tv show- I focus on the words instead of my brain and it really helps me calm. Bobs burgers is my designated sleep show because I’ve seen it all before!
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Is the issue due to the medication? If that's the case, then I'm unsure what a long-term solution is. I have tons of Seroquel left over from years ago, and I've been slowly going through it to help me fall asleep at night if I take my meds any time after 1 pm. Idk if my current doctor would prescribe it."

psa: it's prescribed by a psychiatrist of course, always consult with a medical professional before taking stuff that could majorly fuck you up if mishandled.

edit: lack of details.

Before starting to take sleeping pills I was sleeping around 3-4 hours a night if I was lucky, going to bed at 4 am and waking up around 8 to go to UNI. Now I more or less consistently go to bed around 11 pm / midnight and wake up feeling a bit groggy but that's it. Sleep ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thumbs_up)"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I'm actually currently working on this with my therapist right now! She suggested a lot of self care. Have a bed time routine so that it eventually tricks your body into sleepy mode, an hour or so before you want to sleep."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"i technically take a medicine about an hour before bed that helps me wind down and sleep so maybe i’m cheating lmao but some other things that really help is reading a book before bed instead of staring at my phone aimlessly like i used to. i spray dr teals sleep spray (not saying this helps, just apart of my ritual honestly lol) and i turn on brown noise 24 hour long version. honestly it helps probably second best to the medicine. super calming and quiets my brain pretty well"

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I had a similar problem with falling asleep that, when paired with birth control, gave me persistent insomnia. I tried calming tea, brown noise, no bright screens, skipping dinner, no sugar before bed, hot showers. The only thing that actually fixed things was forcing a 5:30am wakeup in preparation for a new job. Get up at the same time every day regardless of how much you sleep and your body will compensate by making you tired at the right time."

How the fuck do you guys sleep,weed 🤷‍♂️
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"If you take meds, i wouldn't take them after 11am. This really messed me up with sleeping. I used to wake up really early and have a good schedule, but recently i messed it up. So if i sleep past 10:30 i won't take meds unless i absolutely have to. This usually resets my sleep schedule to a decent one. I also don't have set schedules for the day,  though, so it's easier for me to do this.

Like others, i listen to stories that I'm not overly intetested in. I'll put it pretty low volume so i can barely make it out and i pass out pretty quick. 

Half the battle is getting into bed. When i first started fixing my sleep, i FORCED myself to BE IN BED by my set sleep time. At the time it was between 9:30pm and 10:15pm. I started getting ready to sleep at 9:30, and ended up in bed by 10:15. If i laid there for longer than 1.5 hours I'd get up, have some water, walk around a little, then lay back down and listen to something again. I wouldn't let myself get up again after that. 

I do take sleep aids, but normally i take those 30-45 minutes before bed, and if i can't sleep I'll take a low dose melatonin before resting again. Tylenol pm or cold/flu pm also knocks me out cold. If i have to, I'll take those for 2-3 days to steady my body into getting used to sleeping (also just congestion relief pm too). Though they do have zzzquil which would probably be better. 

I also try to cut ANY caffeine 6 hours before i plan to sleep. I used to think coffee until 10pm didn't bug me... but oh man, it helped me sleep so much when i just swapped to water."

I have  picked it up again and it really does make a massive difference to my sleep. I used to be a restless side sleeper, always kicking and flipping over.

Now I just lay on my back and let the dreams take over and wake up in the same position feeling much more refreshed than I can ever remember. 

Sure, there are still some nights where I look at my phone too long but don’t write it off."

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I pick a bedtime and then Do the Bedtime Routine and almost invariably become sleepy. Like, I'm usually tired at the end of the day, but even if I'm not, I do it at the right time. The bedtime routine is teethbrushing, jammies, shower,and  tea. If I'm having trouble I do a lil sleepytime yoga and read a book. I am really careful about screen time at night, and alcohol or heavy meals too close to bed.

Also, I get a fair bit of exercise, and have a job that ties me to normal circadian rhythms. The Bedtime Routine has been years in the making. Damn is it worth it though."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I've never particularly had problems getting to sleep, but sometimes I doom scroll which is a problem. I've recently started putting on a podcast called Nothing Much Happens which is amazing. The host writes and reads these stories which are just boring enough that you fall asleep. The host is great about relaxing you by saying things like, YouTube done enough for today, or, this is part 2 of a 3 part story and if you missed part one, don't worry, nothing much happens. The best praise I can give it is that I've never once heard or remembered any of them. And because they're absolutely free, there's no reason to not give one a shot and see if it works for you."

But I don't do that job anymore. Now the only way I can fall asleep is by taking some lorazepam or clonazepam or zopiclone, otherwise I'm awake for hours. Think it's because I'm struggling with anxiety at night, can't switch off and over think when my meds wear off but I'm very calm during the day when my vyvanse is working."

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"The only thing that has worked for me after years of insomnia, sleeping pills and being fired for being late is building a sleep routine. It's probably the only constant thing in my whole life and somehow the only set of things I can manage to do regularly. 

For me I wash my face and brush my teeth (I know a lot of y'all struggle with teeth brushing but I NEED to do it) I have a cool mist scented oil diffuser I put 4 drops lavender and 2 drops of peppermint oil into. Turn on my white noise machine, fluff my pillow, put on lavender scented cuticle oil, and turn on one of my trusty audiobooks with a 30min sleep timer (I listen to the Harry Potter series or Sherlock Holmes both narrated by Stephen Fry at .95% speed for ultimate comfort)  I do these things like 350 nights out of the year and it really works for me. At first I'd still be restless, might still get up again or reset the sleep timer a few times or browse my phone but eventually it does like pavlovian things to your brain to have all these little triggers leading up to bed time. 

I understand it's a huge ask for anyone with ADHD to be regimented and consistent I'm not sure why I'm able to pull this off while my morning is always absolute chaos like it's the first time I've ever gotten ready for work but I figured it's worth mentioning. Best of luck."

So if I’ve fought myself all evening on sleep, the early morning block of 4:00-10:00 would be the time I went to sleep and I could settle myself with pajamas and an energy drink.

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Hi u/flamingfia, I've experienced this issue before and wanted to share some advice. While it may not seem dangerous at first, persistent difficulty falling asleep can have serious consequences for a person's health in the long run. If your mind is engaged in a thought, you won't be able to fall asleep.

  
One effective technique to overcome this problem is to follow a simple rule: To fall asleep, you need to drop the thought and let go of any struggles or worries you might have. If you keep pursuing the thought or continue to struggle against it, you'll likely have a sleepless night. It may sound simple, but give it a try – you might be surprised at how effective this trick can be."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,[deleted]
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Normally because of my partner.

I’m not kidding. I follow what he says is an appropriate bed time and then I focus on matching his breathing once I’m in bed with him. It also helps that when I’m warm I’m sleepy (I’m always cold) so when he holds me it gets me to sleep temperature.

Whenever he leaves for a weekend for some reason I end up getting caught up in cleaning or re-organizing until about 5-6am and sleep until 2pm. I’m a hot mess without him but I do set reminder alarms that it’s sleep time.

If I didn’t have my partner I have calculated the minimum amount of sleep I need to do my job well and it’s 4 hours average every night, I can get away with 2.5 hours if it’s a one night deal. Usually at this point I may have been up for almost 24 hours so I do get sleepy.

A lot of people have a routine and that might work. I use to do a gentle stretching routine at 9:30pm and then no more digital devices after that. It worked fairly well."

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Things that have helped me -

'The Sleep Book' by Dr. Guy Meadows (not the Dr. Seuss book):
A therapist recommended it to me a few years back. It's a ACT/mindfulness approach to going to sleep. I found it very helpful (and this is a reminder to me to read it again). One of the takeaways for me was to stop worrying about every little possible outside factor to sleep, and just focus on what's happening inside yourself. Meaning, don't get distracted by getting the right kind of white noise machine, or stare at the ceiling thinking things like 'If I only had this fancy white noise machine, or took this supplement I heard about'. Or worse, what I've done before - Google 'insomnia cures' at 2:15 am. 
Focus on your breathing, and chill. 

Mindfulness meditation:
I've found mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) to be helpful. Similar to the recommendation above. Search Jon Kabat Zinn in YouTube, and you'll find some good guided meditations. I don't think sleep is the goal of those mediations, but it's been helpful for me. 

The BBC Shipping Forecast:
Another good YouTube search. It's literally just a person reading out maritime weather reports, and is one of the most boring, and relaxing things I've ever heard. The voice of the reporter can be helpful in blocking out the voices in my head, but it's just so incredibly boring that my brain can't latch onto the actual content."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Trazodone.  Life-saver.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Idk... I just have random thoughts and mental scenarios and sometimes I detect these make no sense at all which is my cue that I'm about to enter sleep.

The rest of the time I pick a ""winding down time"" an hour before I want to sleep. I set a lockout timer on my phone so the dopamine scrolling can't keep me. I have herbal tea and/or a melatonin. Sometimes I write in my journal, sometimes I wash dishes or fold laundry. If I wake up during the night I don't let myself look at my phone. It's off limits for me until it's time for me to wake up, because my phone will always give me a reason to give up after three hours of sleep."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I’ve tried this 24 hours background sounds. It’s amazing how rested I’m at mornings when used it

How the fuck do you guys sleep,Honestly same (me rn bout to sleep by 2 am) but meditation does wonders. I actually came up w the three ms anyone wanna guess what the other two are? 😂
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Don't take meds after 2pm . Cut the dose, exercise,, wake up before 10am and turn off phone screen, ringer etc at least 30 min before bed. 

Try melatonin, magnesium and taking 1/2 your dose. Skip weekends and talk to Dr"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"1. Don't nap during the day even if your so tired that you can't keep your eyes open
2. If you cant sleep try meditatng i just try to feel the sensation of my body rising when i breath in and falling when i breath out or just count your breath
3. Try not to go on your phone or read anything excitimg eg, manwah, scrolling tik tok even when your tired you wont sleep
4. Instead do something boring like read a book I have a kindle and oml its so boring I fall asleep reading
5. Try to exercise or do tiring things throughout the day then you wont have any energy left"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,if I don't go to bed my cat doesn't sleep with me. Cat is essential to sleep.

How the fuck do you guys sleep,The French Whisperer!! This guy has helped me sleep nearly every night for the last 2  years. https://m.youtube.com/@TheFrenchWhispererASMR
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I find my Xaggitin helps me sleep better. I also seem to be dream more; I went from having a dream once a month to every night. Sleep hygiene is really important so I start winding down one hour before sleep . This means that I am ready for bed and I stop using screens e.g. phone. Finally, listening to brown noise helps me as well."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Gabapentin
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Second this. I start the podcast BEFORE I go to bed, so then because I have stimulation it's much easier to make the decision to begin the process of going to bed etc."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,I can only do this with certain podcasts as if they raise their voices or laugh or anything it jolts me awake again. Boring Books at Bedtime exists for this reason so I listen to that if I'm struggling to sleep.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,[removed]
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I do something similar but with let's plays. There's a lot of asmr Minecraft let's plays but the sounds of grass and leaves breaking is unpleasant so I started watching Stardew valley let's plays and that's the ticket for me, especially if it's a replay of a full Livestream with fifty eleven million parts.

What kind of podcasts do you like?"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Before, I listened to instrumental music but then lately I also started listening to podcasts of audiobooks even though my mind is thinking about other things instead of listening to the story. Atleast after some time though I'm already drifted to sleep 😴 I also think of it as a practice to sleep even though there's a background noise of people talking"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,I just responded but yes podcasts for me too. I don't put mine on a timer but most of my podcasts are done within an hour and once it finishes it stops anyway. I've been doing this for years and years now
How the fuck do you guys sleep,I used to have speakers set up in my room and I would put music on. That actually worked great but I haven't done that in over a decade.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Man I wish this worked for me, but if it’s a podcast I’m at all interested in then my brain will inevitably find something in it to think about and it not go to sleep, and if I’m not interested in it then it will likely annoy me enough to keep me from sleeping. Maybe I need to try something so boring that it lulls me, like recordings of 10th grade math lectures by teachers with droning voices- I remember that being really effective back then 😂"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"This right here. Even down to the 45 minute timer. I’ll add that it’s typically better for me not to choose a podcast that is about something I’m much too passionate about in the moment because that can at times make me want to jump out of bed to work on a related task or to at least right notes on new ideas I’m getting as I listen. It’s got to be interesting enough to make me focus on whatever is being discussed, yet not fascinating enough that it makes me want to listen to every word until the podcast is finished.  
I personally like to listen to Alan Watts lectures or podcasts about technology as they can both be a bit abstract yet not make me hang on every word they’re saying as I try to fly off to dreamland."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Wow - trying this tonight, great idea"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,This is the only thing that reliably works with the least amount of effort on my part. This is the way!
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Depending on how quickly you can get to sleep a longer timer can be good too. I have mine at two hours because if I have it set for 45 mins or an hour I worry about having to get to sleep within an hour or having to reset the timer, so it gives you the wiggle room for those days where even with the distraction you can't sleep too quickly.

Also if you listen to the same series/books on repeat it can help get you in to ""sleep mode"" as you associate that story with nodding off"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"The sleep timer idea is pretty good.  I usually go with a podcast playing on a tablet until the device shuts off due to inactivity, or listen (not watch) a YouTube video until it shuts off due to inactivity.

The key thing is that it needs to be light entertainment and voices talking, something that my mind doesn’t need nor want to engage with intellectually and allow the torrent of thoughts to subside.  

The last thing I need is meditation and being alone with thoughts … that’s a recipe for how to be fully awake 101."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Pretty much this, I need to be listening to something. A podcast or some YouTube video you don't need to watch just listen, well like a podcast 😂 

Music doesn't cut it though. It needs to be some kind of narrative."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,I do this and play a rainstorm soundtrack at the same time. It works wonders.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"This is what I do too. 10/10 recommend. 

My go to is Stuff You Should Know and then runner up is Conan O’Brian needs a friend 

I also occasionally listen to guided meditations on the Insight Timer App. 

What podcasts do you listen to?"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,I listen to BBC’s world tonight on radio 4 every single night. Otherwise I read if I can’t listen to podcasts. Reading is really the correct answer
How the fuck do you guys sleep,I’m learning Spanish so I listen to Spanish videos on YouTube. The same ones over and over. I focus on what they are saying and guaranteed to fall asleep within 5-10 minutes nearly every single time.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Same! Or the TV on a true crime show that I can just listen to!
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"The ""I Can't Sleep"" podcast is really nice. Every episode is basically just the host reading a Wikipedia article on something boring. I listen to it every night because I need to listen to something but if it's interesting I'll stay awake and for some reason I can't fall asleep to music. The only issue is that a lot of the episodes actually are interesting to me so I have to listen to some of the episodes again if he didn't post a new one that I find boring."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Yes! This! Podcasts have worked for me like a charm. 

I also highly recommend reading if you can, and just putting the book down and going straight to sleep when you can’t keep your eyes open, even if the book is still there and stuck to your cheek in the morning."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,How long does it take you to do 10k steps?
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Same, I run 10k every day on a treadmill while watching YouTube or something.  The hardest part is having something interesting to watch."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Uhh, this doesn’t work for me…avid runner, cyclist, and ice hockey play, as in, at least 100-150 bike miles per week, 30-50 running miles per week, dependent on what I’m training for, and 2 hockey games per week….today, I did 105 miles on my bike, I will still need an ambien to go to sleep. Hell…just did a marathon about a month ago, I still had to take an ambien that night."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,I could do 20km of walking on holiday every day and I still had horrible insomnia.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,I’m glad I’m not the only person thinking 2am is amateur hour but hesitant to post it so I don’t seem like a dick. I was officially diagnosed with delayed sleep phase syndrome which tracks with - genuinely - my entire life but ADHD has never helped. The only med that works PRN is Xanax and no doctor is willing to prescribe. So trazodone and groggy it is.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,I recently started meds and I feel like I sleep better. I wake up way less frequently. Yesterday I was even ready to take a nap after just taking them. Probably not the right dose yet for me :')
How the fuck do you guys sleep,4AM for me! lmao
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"3:55am here. I picked up a saying from my ex who also had ADHD, sleep is for the weak and well advised."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,5am as well hahaha FL can't sleep
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I just stated new meds and yeah, this feels like it’s gonna be a problem. And I went with the “non-stimulant” meds lol."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,7 am gang ha ha ha (help)
How the fuck do you guys sleep,4am for me :(
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"You provide a lot of great tips, so I will just add that in general not getting into bed until planning on falling asleep is a good habit from what I’ve been told. I can’t seem to follow that advice myself though 😆"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Yes! The vitamin D you get from the sun helps with sleep.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I got a part time job working outside at a garden nursery, as WFH on a computer has made my symptoms so much worse.  I almost forget I have this shit when I'm doing labor and chatting with people in the sunshine surrounded by plants.

I've always been a night owl, but I naturally fell asleep at 10:45 last night - On a SATURDAY!"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Meditation has been a game changer for me. Doesn't always put me out, but sleep has been more consistent than it has been in years."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Came here to also suggest Trazodone. Stuff has changed my life, honestly!"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Trazodone has been pretty helpful and from what my doc told me it actually doesn’t have a negative effect on sleep cycles like ambien does. That said, it takes me a full 2 or 3 hours after waking up to be able to function properly. The grogginess is real. That also said it’s better than the life sucking emptiness of not sleeping more than 3 or 4 hours for 5 days in a row."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Omg I tried my dad's trazadone once and it made me dream while awake and projectile vomit. It was an intense and scary night that involved no sleep. I guess I ODed even though it was just his normal dose? That stuff is STRONG
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Trazadone gave me the worst eye pain - pressure, movement, the works. I’m so bummed it seems to work for so many people."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,I started on trazadone because another medication was making it hard for me to fall and stay sleep and I can honestly say it’s one of the best tools for me to manage my ADHD. I can finally control when I go to sleep. I get ready for bed around the same time every night and wake up at about the same time every morning for the first time in my life. It’s incredible.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I used do screens when I couldn't sleep.  I'll have to follow your advice on NOT to do that.  Would walking around your dwelling, or just going outside for a stroll be helpful?  I'm thinking walking gets your blood flowing and energy levels higher, so it may work *against* being able to get back to sleep?  Otherwise, what about household chores like getting the mail, taking out the trash, doing dishes, or wiping down dust?"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Remember that thing you did when you were 12 that was probably an outburst/meltdown due to unmanaged adhd but people shamed you into thinking it’s because you were emotionally unstable and volatile, and a terrible person?"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,7 am for me
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I was literally scrolling through these comments thinking the same thing. If I'm sitting still in the same spot for longer than 5-10 mins, I'm passing out from lack of stimulation. Even if I had taken my meds, at any point in time I could just lay down and pass out."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,I’m both. I can only sleep when I’m not supposed to be sleeping. I think its my body just being contrary. I sleep fantastically if I have to be anywhere in the next hour. Maybe its anxiety manifesting as avoidance by making me sleep. I’m literally just pulling words out of my ass.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Fr, I'm mildly jealous of people when they can stay awake and daydream. I'm just out within a minute of hitting the pillow"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Interactive screen time is the problem.  Making/responding to posts/texts.  Playing a video game.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,You should check out sleepcore on YouTube.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"What you want is not ""explosion a galore"" action movies. What you want is something that's mentally chilling.

How the fuck do you guys sleep,I just started Clonidine at night time and it has been a game changer!
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I am prescribed Clonidine as needed. It helps me fall asleep, but I feel like my overall sleep quality is mediocre to poor when I take it."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Seconded for clonidine. It was like a damn cure for my decade-long insomnia. Some effectiveness has worn off now 9 months later but still a life saver. I don't know if it's directly helping my ADHD, or helping me cope and live my life better due to solid consistent sleep, but man is it helping."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"coffee/concerta in the morning, indica in the evening has been working well for me"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Why is this so far down? I out cold in 5 minutes, best method for me."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Sadly after 15 or so years of continuous and heavy use it has lost its impact. No matter how long the tolerance break I take I’m back to it not working as good within a day or two. It really feels like I’m only smoking for medicinal reasons vs to get high lately.

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I'm confident I'm an undiagnosed ADHD because I have a lot of the characteristics and this is me to a T, I struggle to go off to sleep and will be up till ridiculous o'clock but then I struggle to wake up once I should and will just often nod back off"

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"About 17 alarms, having to piss really badly, and the fear of being fired if I'm really late to work usually does the trick. Weekends I sleep till 3 lol"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,How do you function!!!???
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Have you been to a doctor about it? Have you tried sleep meds? When did this all start for you?
How the fuck do you guys sleep,This guy gets it.  I run 10k everyday on the home treadmill.  Keeps me in great shape and helps with symtoms and sleep.  Hardest part is finding something to watch that can keep my attention for an hour a day.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Sadly not even this works for me. Even on days where I work myself dead physically I still can’t sleep properly without meds and / or a very specific routine.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Weighted blanket and putting something on that I’ve already seen like a favorite anime actually helps me a lot. That way I’m interested enough to quiet my mind but since I’ve already seen it I have no issues going to sleep instead of watching. I bet exercise would help too if I could actually motivate myself to do that.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,oh also I have an emotional support plushie that honestly just helps my arms to have a place to go (i have no idea where to put them when i speep)
How the fuck do you guys sleep,I second this! Plus breathe excerise as well!
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"You know I have noticed a connection between a specific leg / hip stretch I do and getting a better sleep.  When I can really focus on the sensations and it feels almost like a release… 

The problem is I can’t consistently replicate that feeling with that stretch."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I got a very ADHDDinos vibe from this post :-P

I have done ""pre-emptive lie-ins"" before - maybe I should get back into that habit, rather than random naps in the middle of the day..."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Same for me. I try to wake up 9 am about every day and then go to sleep at like 11:30 pm

I absolutely HATE going to bed after 12 am thats too much for me so I have a hard deadline every night for when I should be in bed."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,">I can’t help myself or you I’m afraid.

The purest of truths."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,i’m curious- do you usually “hang out” in bed on your phone well before you actually want to sleep? or do you go to bed when you actually want to sleep and get stuck up on your phone? asking because i found if i don’t get into bed until i’m actually trying to go to sleep it helps a ton!
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I heard melatonin helps, bought some a month or two ago and not used it yet. How much of a difference does it make?"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,I'm on gabapentin for sleep as well and I resenting did a bunch of research on it - and it kind of freaked me out - have you had to up your space because it becomes less effective?
How the fuck do you guys sleep,curious which polyphasic sleep schedule works for you?? thinking about trying this about myself because honestly i’ve been unofficially doing it for awhile
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I was also prescribed this, and I honestly didn't *feel* any major effects, but I still think it did help me get to sleep, at least somewhat. I don't know exactly how it helped me get to sleep, because I didn't feel more tired or slower or anything, so maybe it was just placebo, who knows."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"This is what I take too.  I have had an awful time sleeping my entire life (it seems to be genetic, everyone in my family has always been that way).  My psych started me on Quetiapine for my depression a while ago, but it made me sleepy and didn't do much otherwise, so he had me take it at night on a low dose, and I've slept so well ever since."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,I like using the bedtime mode on my phone to help prevent me from using other apps after a certain time
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"ugh you’re lucky, i have that part of ADHD where ASMR noises make me want to rip my ear drums out lol can’t do the little noises"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,ASMR lol.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,I listen to motionless in white to help me sleep.  That mixed with a few other tricks usually allows me to get at least SOME sleep. Still not great but better than nothing.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Yup, literally this, I usually stick my Spotify playlist on my computer and have it play through the headset, it's just loud enough to be good background music not too loud to wake me up never realised how much I needed it until I ended up at a girls house last night, couldn't sleep without it and when I did I got woken up by one of those automatic air fresheners going off"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"This only works for me if it’s a boring, even level sound, book that I’ve already listened to.

How the fuck do you guys sleep,Also no naps ever. :(
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Oh and a chilled room. My ac only brings my room down to about 68 which sucks but it’s better than 84. If I had the ability I’d be sleeping with my room at 40 every night.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"My asmr videos include sand cutting, soap cutting, and the “swordcoast soundscapes” d&d ambience sounds lol. I especially like the crowded tavern"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Also, try not to eat anything for at least two hours before you go to sleep. Don't go to sleep with a full stomach. applicable to you only if you are not engaged in any other distractions like using electronic devices while in bed till you fall asleep. If this is an issue you will have to avoid using the electronic device for at least an hour before you go to bed and it will take time for your body to accept your new routine. If you try to avoid using electronics till you fall asleep you will have a hard time shedding that habit. As you have conditioned your body to instant gratification and dopamine high. You will struggle to sleep the first few nights while trying to avoid using electronic gadgets before sleeping. The only secret or important point to remember is to no matter how hard the urge you get to use the phone while you are in bed to sleep don't go for it, don't pick it up and start using your phone. Embrace the repulsive and unpleasant feeling for a few days. Eventually, your body will get used to it and you will have a good night's sleep. But remember **""IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME""**. The result won't be immediate but surely it will be rewarding. The energy levels for the next day are directly proportional to the quality of sleep you have the previous night.

Also try to not to eat anything at least two hours before you go to sleep. Dont go to sleep with a full stomach."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Try to keep the amount of light in the room you sleep in as low as possible.

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I can't listen to stuff with words because I'll focus on what they're talking about and stay awake to listen to what they have to say lol.  
  
I usually listen to white noise or ""space ambiance"" (light brown noise mixed with white noise is how I'd describe it, I guess).  
 No words. Just a droning I can zone out and fall asleep to lol"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I listen to Bedtime Stories for Grownups to do this. Simple, beautiful stories read in a soothing voice. It works really well."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"me too! but it's really difficult finding podcasts that are just the right amount of stimulation, nothing super noisy/chaotic but if it's too boring then I can't make myself listen to it either"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Yeah I use audiobooks since the story is compelling enough but it's usually one voice at a steady tone. I get library audiobooks via Libby which has a sleep timer function. It's nice because the sleep timer can also end at chapters.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I love tons and tons of different podcasts. I've listened to 326 days worth of podcasts since 2017 according to my podcast app haha. Right now the one I use for sleep is the podcast Blank check. All the early episodes they spend going through the star wars prequels movies in painful levels of detail pretending these are the only star wars movies, but they are so funny about the whole thing I'm just giggling and in such a good mood as I fall asleep, who on earth talks about a 2 minute scene in a 20 year old movie for an hour it's totally insane but I love it.

Other than that it's mostly Television, History, some UK specific ones like help I sexted my boss, and any podcast Merlin Mann is involved in is super funny.

Thinking about it I can totally see the appeal to a stardew valley lets play, that sounds really relaxing!"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"it's a balance. Make sure it is in a topic you are interested in, but delivered in such a way that you cant help but drift off. 

Think of it in terms of a super boring college professor..... dronninnnggg on...."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Highly recommend the Boring Books for Bedtime podcast. The selections are interesting enough to give your brain a point of focus as the readers' soothing voice lulls you to sleep.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Ohh yes it has to be just interesting enough like you said.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,This is the way!
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Maybe 90 minutes for me? But I take a long-ish walk, swinging by the shops for the daily grocery stuff on the way back. 

Cutting out the shops would probably make it a shorter trip, mind."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Yeah I need a podcast or audiobook while I'm walking. 

Hell I need a podcast, audiobook or video playing while I'm painting too."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Trazodone was great for me for sleep. Unfortunately, I can’t get my current psychiatrist to prescribe it with my irregular work schedule. But it’s one of the trade offs I’ve had to tolerate with what’s otherwise a great doctor-patient relationship."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Ask for zopiclone. Trazodone makes me super groggy but zopiclone is almost as good as natural sleep. When my insomnia was bad, I took it every other day and I had no problem stopping it when I didn’t need it any more. Now I only need one every few weeks or so."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,2am would count as a pretty decent sleeping time for me.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"What did they tell you to do due to delayed sleep phase syndrome?

I am writing this at 4.40am local time.

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"See if the doc will prescribe Quetiapine, no grogginess in the morning. I was a zombie taking trazodone, but cannot sleep without meds. Finally explained the full experience of trazodone zombie life, and she switched me to Quetiapine. I wake up, and am actually awake now."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Okay, I'm eventually going to need to ask my doc to prescribe me something for sleep, I think Seroquel does wonders (I've been using my old stock that I didn't use years ago) but I was worried that doctors would be concerned about prescribing a sleep medication, that's being used to solve a problem being caused by a different medication."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"The nap thing is common. Yeah, it’s a stimulant, but suddenly it’s quiet inside your head"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,i sleep good when i can sleep! last night i slept good but only for 3 hours :(
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I remember reading a LPT type thing (before LPTs were a thing) that said a great way to perk yourself up is to neck a strong coffee and *immediately* go for a nap.

The caffeine takes around 20 minutes to reach your brain, which means you get a ~20 minute nap and wake up before ""nap"" turns into ""sleep"" and you don't want to wake up again, plus your wake-up timing coincides with the caffeine perkiness, so you get the best of both worlds.

Dex (and other immediate release stimulants) will similarly usually take 20-30 minutes to wake you up. I and others here will take our pills when our alarm goes off, then immediately turn over and go back to sleep to wait for them to wake us up :-P

If you're having a nap *after* the ~20 minutes it takes for the pill to reach your brain, then what's happening is probably that your pill is allowing you to notice that you're chronically sleep deprived and *need* more sleep. I don't get that effect myself, but I do tend to get ""enough"" sleep most of the time - and way too much when I'm depressed and not working, like the last ~5 months :-/"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,5:44am here. Will switch to my book soon (then come crawling back to play sudoku until the sleepies finally kick in sufficiently)
How the fuck do you guys sleep,I'll sleep when I'm dead. 4am-5am each night. Can't ever seem to change it.

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Lisdexamfetamine helps regulate my circadian rhythm - going to bed earlier, waking earlier. I used to be reminded to sleep by the birds chirping outside my window!"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Yeah, best advice I heard years ago was keep the bed just for sleeping (and intimacy). If I don’t spend any of my regular time in bed, it gives me a sort of Pavlovian response and I get a lil more tired"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Regular early morning sunlight also calibrates your circadian clock so that you get tired at bedtime.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I'm glad to hear it. Sometimes I wonder how much is ""disorder"" and how much is ""not made for modern life""...  but hey I work on a computer all day long, usually working from home, so not like I'll ever know..."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Going outside is basically always good I think, just keep it slow and peaceful. If you tidy things in the house again just keep it slow, don't rush anything, don't strain in any way.  It's all about winding down.  If you want to get some things done maybe take lots of breaks in between things so you give yourself a chance to notice any tiredness."

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Before i was diagnosed and when I was in a particularly boring job, id fall asleep sitting up. I couldn't control it. It was so wild - i didn't know it was ADHD but knew the second i was bored i would have to get up and walk around otherwise - lights out."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Nah man, I have had that avoidance theory for years. Nothing makes me more sleepy than having to do something I don't want to do. In the evening though? Yay books and Netflix! 

Right now, medication helps a lot with day tiredness but makes me wired in the evening, so sleepy juice it is. I recently said to my husband 'I know I'm supposed to only take it as necessary, but I fall asleep like I'm passing out, sleep like a stone and get double my usual deep sleep. When I wake up I just get up like it's no big deal.' He said, 'Well, sounds like necessary to me then'. He has a point I guess."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I solve puzzles. Like sudoku, solitaire, water sort, etc. to bore me to sleep. It works to stimulate my brain just enough to not let my brain get distracted by every embarassing thing I’ve ever done but its not quite stimulating enough for me to want to keep doing it for a very long time. Just long enough for me to get tired."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,It does :) it’s a blood pressure med. it feels like you took a nice hot bath and your eyelids are heavy :)
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Tizanidine is similar for sleep but doesn't drop BP so much.  It's great for initiating sleep.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,I like clonidine. I used it when I needed to get off morphine. It was helpful. Useful drug in a myriad of ways.

I had to up my dose a bunch of times at first but, I've been on this dose for over a year now. which is 1 pill am, 1 pill noon and 3 at night so like 1500 total.  

Doesn't totally get rid of the pain or totally help me sleep but helps overall and compliments the other stuff."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Yh if you're doing it unofficial, fixing it alongside your circadian rhythm will give you more energy.

The nap times mean I also avoid energy dips. You're definitely tired by 11pm (on the extended core sleep schedule) as it's the only time you get ""deep"" sleep (sws)."

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I listen to hard hitting techno, I know it sounds crazy but the repetitiveness of most techno songs makes me relaxed and puts me to sleep."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I'm gonna post this a couple places so people see it, but I've recently started listening to ""Nothing Much happens"" which is basically what it sounds like, stories that are just boring enough that you fall asleep. The best thing I can say about it is that I've never once heard or remembered any of them."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,White noise didn’t help me until I had a kid who had a white noise machine in her room every night (her room was next to mine) and I second hand listened to it and found out it is super helpful
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"This

[guy so boring he has a podcast to put people to sleep](https://www.sleepwithmepodcast.com)"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,This is why I listen to the same audiobooks over and over. I already know the story so I'm not invested enough to be kept awake. I ALSO have a white noise machine to drown out any distractions.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"That's where the key is listening to something you're either really familiar with, or find pretty boring, so that you can let it become passive stimulation instead of caring about paying attention to it."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Do you mean Nothing Much Happens?
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Will seek that one out thank you.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I like Lore and Noble Blood for this purpose. Combo of pretty mellow voiced narrator, interesting content (Folklore or Historical Royal Deaths) and instrumentals knocks me out pretty quickly."

How the fuck do you guys sleep,Give the misfits podcast a listen it's goofy shit you can tune out to
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"For me the right kind of stimulation is some spacy/long conversation (**Lex Fridman**) or story/idea-telling. Very great one also (if you are into sci-fy and science) **Issac Arthur SFIA** on any podcasting app..

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"How did you wean yourself off of it? Do you use something else to help? I’ve been on zopiclone daily for probably 3-4 years. And I would like to wean off but I cannot sleep with out it, I’ve tried a few times. Any tips would be helpful"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Thanks, I’ve never heard of that one! I’ll talk to my doctor. Appreciate it."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,thanks for this! I've been offered traz and haven't looked into it yet but was wary of feeling groggier.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Well, to start, traditional sleep meds won’t work and may even be dangerous because we’re not naturally tired. For example, Ambien can cause you to sleepwalk (or cook …or drive) because it targets insomnia, which is situational or behavioral, and if you don’t fully fall asleep *or* wake up on it you’re at higher risk. Speaking of behavioral, things like sleep schedules and good sleep hygiene only work for so long. Ultimately what has helped are two things: non-traditional sleep medicine and an adjusted work schedule. With those I’ve been able to maintain a 1am (ish) to 9am (ish) sleep pattern - yes pattern, because I am going to sleep when I can fall asleep naturally (it helps I’m normally tired around 1-2). I will say that if I get off in any way it moves later and later, and I will be awake at 5am. That’s when meds help. BUT I will never force myself to sleep at 10pm, which is when sleep schedules and hygiene might be good for someone with just insomnia. Oddly enough, being on my phone helps me fall asleep, especially scrolling TikTok or doing a New York Times crossword which is fully against sleep hygiene practices. I also may sometimes get tired at 10, like when I’m not sleeping until 5 and have to get up at 9, which is when the adjusted work*** schedule helps because I can catch up on sleep debt. I will say, like insomniacs, napping during the day doesn’t help *at all*. 

That’s a lot of rambling but it becomes less behavioral/environmental changes (aka sleep hygiene/schedules) and more supporting when you are actually tired on average then leaning on that. I take trazodone when I’m a little off, and Xanax when I’m way off. I worked with a sleep medicine specialist first then my psychiatrist worked with me on meds. I know specialists aren’t always the most available, so my recommendation in that case is finding your pattern and looking at if an alternate work schedule is available to you. We’re just not built for the 8-5 corporate world. I get it, though, and recognize I’m incredibly privileged. Oh!! And adhd meds have actually helped too! But this was the system before adding those."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Oh no. That sucks! I know the feeling though. Super frustrating. Hope you get a better night of sleep soon.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"thanks for the reply!

Also, what are your views on blue light filters for desktop computer and phone (they make the screen have more orange glow, removing blue light that messes with your body's ability to sleep)?  I've only recently begun using them.  I guess they help, but will need more time to be sure."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,I have been smacked with a ball cap by a bus driver.... are you me from the future... or the past... not sure how that works...
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"That sounds nice, thanks for the answer 😄 I'm gonna put that on my list in case the med im testing now (trazodone) isn't working out. 

Before that I took zopiclone, which does work like a sleep hammer for my brain, I'm out in 20 minutes. But its not something that I can take longer than 2 to 4 weeks because of the addiction risks of z-drugs."

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"For me cowboy bebop, samurai champloo, neon genesis evangelion and death note are staples for bed time. They are some of my favorite anime’s from childhood and remind me of watching them with my sister who I love very much. Cowboy bebop is especially good for bedtime because it’s got a great jazz soundtrack which is a bonus. I could watch these anime’s 1000x and still love em but since I’ve already seen em many times I also don’t feel like I have to stay awake to watch it. So maybe try and find something that give you a similar feeling."

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"My walk into university is about an hour, and that gets me around 8,000 steps alone. 10k steps doesn't really take too much time if the walk you do is pretty easy!"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"10k steps is one of those numbers that sounds big, but it’s only like… 4 miles. An average healthy adult is able to walk that in well under 2 hours.

If you’re like me, and you have a tendency to pace inside your home on very bad days, get in the habit of interrupting that and taking the same behavior outside."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,I think daily use is a different kettle of fish. My doc told me to only take it every other day to avoid having to taper off. Sorry friend. Good luck. 🙂
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Try going down on your dose slowly. I often take a half or even a quarter of a tab (my big problem is sleep initiation, so sometimes the lower dose is enough to get me to sleep)"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,If you drink alcohol make sure you don't drink on the same day as taking zopiclone because it can make you black out but stay awake and do some really weird things
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Thank you <3
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I think they are better than not having them but all in all I've learned over the years that it's not so much the light it's more the mental stimulation that is the issue.  At a certain point I learned that it's better to stop putting things into my brain.  Not just screens, books as well.  I can handle a boring podcast that I don't really pay attention to and isn't interesting to me.  There are some podcasts specifically designed for this."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Makes sense. I’ve taken the “habit forming/addictive” drugs as well. I like Clonidine much better. It feels safe and natural. It is mostly prescribed to kids with adhd., particularly kids who cannot sit still. I was that kid at one point, so that may have something to do with my success on Clonidine. I forgot to mention… not only do I take 0.3 mg at night, but I take 0.05 mg at 12pm. It reduces some of the negative side effects of stimulants, especially anxiety. That is also why it is prescribed to adhd adults. Check it out :)"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Was prescribed Zopiclone a few years back. Like you said it’s a sleep hammer for the brain but I found myself too groggy in the morn(like I had smoked 10 joints the night before) and I would start tripping/hallucinating on the tube to work the next morn too so gave it up after a week. Told my doc and she suggested I smoke a joint to help me sleep…zing!!!
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"For me I had dosage problems with blood pressure meds even with small doses. I’d wake up a few hours after I took them with my heart racing because my body was responding to my blood pressure lowering.

My psych who specializes in adhd treatment swears by blood pressure meds for treatment though."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Yup.  Good for inducing sleep.  I find gabapentin is good for maintaining sleep, and still lets you dream, unlike cannabis.  Cannabis is amazing used occasionally, but man, you don't get much REM sleep and that sucks."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Damn I'm sorry to hear that. Magnesium Glycinate also really helps me sleep, if you're able to get that it may be worth a try."

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I will say that not everyone I have recommended those two have found them good to sleep too, but I also think maybe it’s an ADHD vs neurotypical difference because the criticism was “too stimulating” where I need it to be interesting enough I won’t think of it as “boring” sleeptime. Anyway, would be interested to hear if you like them. Personally, I can listen to the same ones over and over because I actually only get 5-10 min in."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"> it’s only like… 4 miles

That depends on how long your legs are, it's about 6 miles for me :-P

On the other hand, I don't have the patience to walk at a slow pace and I'm reasonably fit so it still doesn't take me long, and I'm getting cardio at the same time, so it's a win all around, really ;-)"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,Ahhh yes that makes sense haha. Thank you!!
How the fuck do you guys sleep,That’s a great idea. Thank you. I’m going to give it a try on the weekends. My problem is also sleep initiation so I’m glad to hear this worked for you!! Appreciate the advice 😊
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Definately gonna do some research into this (Clonidine) as the sleep struggle is extremely real for me and I can get a bit overwhelmed by the stimulant effects in the morning right after it kicks in properly so this may be able to help.

Could I ask where in the world you are? and how you came across the drug? just as im in the UK and im not sure if it will be different for me here.

Edit: After looking at the drug on the UK National Health Service website it seems it cannot be prescribed to people who are diagnosed with Clinical Depression which rules me out. The search continues."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I’ve got a plethora of issues. Nerve damage. L4 L5 S1 issues. Disc degeneration. My SI joint is so fucked up. Artificial knees. Throw a new injury into the mix for added fun lol

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Yea, UK.

How would I go about that? I think my phone call is on the 20th next month"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I have cautions on melatonin… 1) The amounts sold are WAY too high.  You don’t need even 1mg to go to sleep.
2) People who deal with depression can have this exacerbated by melatonin.  Don’t take it more than one night at a time or it could cause a depressive episode.
3) It REALY shouldn’t be used long term, because you can become dependent on it.  Use more natural remedies, i.e. a darkened room, a bedtime routine, don’t use your bed for anything other than sleep or sex… well, I can’t personally do that.
Don’t push off your feelings during the day if you can help it.  Meditate and allow those feelings to surface, and just sit with them.  Allow yourself to work through the anxiety so it’s not sitting on your brain the first time all day you’ve stopped doing.  

Meds can help, but they aren’t a cure, they are a crutch.  Use them as a crutch, don’t consider them a cure.  Do whatever healing work you need to do… you WILL sleep better and you will feel better."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Same! I have a couple stories that I absolutely love and I listen to on repeat. 

I swear the gardening one from the first season and the one about opening the bakery from the first season are the best at getting me to sleep. I listened to them at the gym one day because I wanted to know what it was that had me sleep so fast and I started getting sleepy on the treadmill."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"How tall are you? I’m 6’5”, and 12k steps was 5 miles for me this past Friday (though I was walking with someone slower than my usual pace, so that’s an inflated step/mile value)."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Do you have melperone in the UK? I get that as syrup in Germany, which makes it incredibly easy to find the perfect dosage. It also has a very short half-life, so you don't really get a hangover if you take your ideal amount."

How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I found out about it while trying to get privately assessed.

There’s an explanation here from one of the providers: https://psychiatry-uk.com/right-to-choose/ - you’ll need to get your GP to refer you directly to whichever service you choose, but waiting lists are overall much shorter.

They say 6 months atm on their site, but you can probably find others with shorter waiting lists."

How the fuck do you guys sleep,We're Pavlovian now! The sound of her voice is just so soothing. I'm going to go look for the gardening episode. Sounds perfect for spring.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I'm 5'11"" but I'm all arms and legs (my arm span is 6'3"") so my legs might actually be longer than yours (85cm from scruttocks to ground), and I do tend to walk at a fairly stiff striding pace, so my steps are lengthened by that compared to a more ambling meander...

By my maths, your paces on that walk were [67cm](https://www.google.com/search?q=5+miles+%2F+12000+in+metres) which feels pretty dinky to me, but my claim of 6 miles in 10,000 steps gives a step length of [97cm](https://www.google.com/search?q=6+miles+%2F+10000+in+metres) which might be a little generous. Hmm.

I'm going to have to actually go out and do some measurements in the morning - perhaps the number I remembered was rounded up when I last calculated it :-/

Some actual figures to work with, then! :-D

On Monday, I walked home from the train station, 2.67km in 2,476 steps taking 32 minutes (according to Google's fitness tracker on my phone with all the caveats of relying on a phone to do the measuring...) which works out at [109cm](https://www.google.com/search?q=2.67km+%2F+2%2C476+in+metres)(!) steps. Honestly, that might be a *particularly* brisk walk, but I feel a little more comfortable about standing by that 6miles / 10,000 steps figure now :-P At that pace, 10,000 steps would be [6.7 miles](https://www.google.com/search?q=10%2C000+*+%282.67km+%2F+2%2C476%29+in+miles)(!) and would take about [2 hours 10 minutes](https://www.google.com/search?q=10%2C000+*+%2832+minutes+%2F+2%2C476%29)

For comparison, a couple of weeks ago, was walking with my 11yo daughter and did 7.27km in 9869 steps taking 1h 49m (again, according to Google) That works out at [74cm](https://www.google.com/search?q=7.27km+%2F+9869+in+metres) steps, which is probably a bit more typical for a ""normal person"" :-P At that rate, 10,000 steps would be [4.7 miles](https://www.google.com/search?q=10000*%287.27km+%2F+9869%29+in+miles) and take about [1 hour 50 minutes](https://www.google.com/search?q=10000*%28%281hour+%2B++49minutes%29+%2F+9869%29+)

The fact that my steps-per-minute figure is *less* for the faster walk ([72 steps/minute](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-e&q=2%2C476+%2F+32) vs. [91](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-e&q=2%2C476+%2F+32)) does throw the *accuracy* of these figures into a little doubt, though. GPS and a mobile phone's accelerometer aren't *100%* accurate / reliable...

Hmm, perhaps I could work out my [steps/minute figure for the longer/slower walk](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-e&q=9869+%2F+%281+hour+%2B+49+minutes%29+in+minutes%5E-1), apply that to the time of the shorter/faster walk to get to a (possibly more accurate, possibly totally nonsense) [new number of steps](https://www.google.com/search?q=%289869+%2F+%281+hour+%2B+49+minutes%29%29+*+32+minutes), then use that to calculate [the step length](https://www.google.com/search?q=2.67km+%2F+%28%289869+%2F+%281+hour+%2B+49+minutes%29%29+*+32+minutes%29+in+metres)? That gives a step length of 92cm, and a 10,000-step distance of [5.7 miles](https://www.google.com/search?q=10%2C000+*+%282.67km+%2F+%28%289869+%2F+%281+hour+%2B+49+minutes%29%29+*+32+minutes%29%29+in+miles) (again in [1 hour 50 minutes](https://www.google.com/search?q=10%2C000+*+%2832+minutes+%2F+%28%289869+%2F+%281+hour+%2B+49+minutes%29%29+*+32+minutes%29%29) because it's the same steps-per-minute figure). Close enough for Jazz :-P

I think I'll stop there :-D"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,">melperone

I did a google and it is also not liscensed for use in the UK either. It also seems to be mainly used as an antipsychotic in Europe with it having a mild sedative effect as a side effect so im not sure if thats something im really after either.

Im really looking for something to just quiet everything and reduce my energy levels of an evening so I can rest. However there honestly doesnt seem to be much available for that outside of a bunch of anti-depressants that cause drowsyness as a side effect, at least in the UK."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,No thank you on *that*. I’m hoping to be off of these sooner than later. I know I’ll need some physical therapy.
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Thanks! Will definitely look into it, how long did it take you and are you on meds now?"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I was talking to a friend about this last night and he was saying how bad melatonin is for you, and all I could say was “Right?”.  There are better ways."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"My steps were very dinky on that walk, like… “need to concentrate on keeping them that small” dinky.

You’d probably get better results by taking a sample of your average footstep length, then measuring the distance you walk without noticeably tiring as accurately as possible. For a distance 10,000 steps, a sampling of 500 steps would be more than enough.

I think what we’re really seeing is the pointlessness of “10,000 steps per day” as life advice. The variance of effect on people based on stride length is too significant to ignore. We should probably just agree on a length if time people should spend actively walking."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Yeah I've read it's supposed to be an antipsychotic but not a very good one? Idk, melperone and pipamperone are some of the most popular sleeping aids for depressive ppl where I live. 
But you're right, it does all look kind of improvised. Maybe that's in the nature of these substances, 'real' tranquilizers do have lots of side effects and addiction potential. 
What about antihistamines? Many of those make you sleepy too and are therefore commonly used as mild sleeping aids as well (in the UK too, as far as I can tell from a quick google search)"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Privately (paying for it in full!) took only 2-3 weeks but I don’t recommend that route because you have to stick with private appointments until you finish adjusting your dose, which can take a long time.

Doing it via right to choose you’ll get the same service but without having to pay for it, so it would be much better overall."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I’m not on meds atm, I had a bad reaction to concerta which was really annoying because it did seem to work, and not started Elvanse yet"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,How bad is melatonin for you?
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I've often thought about good ways to measure activity that aren't stymied by physiological / geometric differences.

The problem with going for *time* is that walking veeeerrrrryyyyy ssssllloooowwwlllyy would count for more than running the same distance, which is a bit arsy-varsy.

The amount of co2 you breathe out would be a pretty good measure (each molecule of co2, represents a carbon atom in a carbohydrate you've burned up...) but not exactly easy to actually *measure*. You'd probably also want to take into account the size of the individual, but simply making that ""Per Kg"" would be pretty good.

A fairly interesting proxy measure would be total heart beats. You'd again want to scale it for the size of your heart, but there isn't actually all that much variation in that (less than total size, given that putting on 5 stones of fat doesn't really do much to the size of your heart) so you could probably just do that by height or maybe armpit-to-armpit distance. If each heart beat represents an ounce (or whatever) of blood, and you assume that oxygen/co2 concentrations are reasonably invariable, that represents represents N oxygen or M co2 molecules shifted around, so one heartbeat probably represents near enough the same number of (millionths of) calories used up as another (let's pretend nobody has tachycardia or panic attacks, though, that'd probably b0rk it all up...)

It also has the advantage of encouraging *aerobic* exercise, which is better for you than merely ""keeping moving"" (though don't underestimate the value of that) and also of scaling up the amount of exercise you need to meet your targets as you get fitter, so you keep getting fitterer :-P

If I ever get my hands on a co2-in-your-breath-ometer and a pulse-measurey-watch, I'll try to put together some numbers to see how the correlation looks :-D (hmm, co2 measurers [aren't *that* expensive](https://www.google.com/search?q=NDIR+CO2+sensor&tbm=shop)...)"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Thanks for the help, will definitely ask my Dr then. Saw your other comment, what was the bad reaction if you don’t mind me asking?"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I can dismiss the issue of someone spending two hours to walk 100 feet because people doing that would deliberately be trying to break the measure, while the issues caused by “10,000 steps” are a result of even *good*-faith engagement with the metric.

We want something that *anyone* with common materials can implement if they earnestly want to, hence a time limit. Functionally, anyone who has access to advice like “10,000 steps” has access to time-measurement technology.

As for the aerobic exercise thing, yeah, but we’re talking about bare minimum exercise. Gotta shoot lower with regards to efficiency."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"With regard to the ""steps"" recommendation, I'm not sure I agree with you that it's all that problematic, though it's obviously a very simple measure which can be thrown off in various ways. At the end of the day, none of these things are really intended to replace a more thorough analysis of all your body's health-correlated parameters - simply provide a reminder to actually *do* any exercise and let you know when you're taking the piss with how much exercise you're not getting :-P

I think it's probably better than time, and I'm *sure* it's better than distance, at scaling appropriately with a person's size.

If you're larger (at least in leg length, but that correlates pretty well with overall height - apes like me are the oddity) each step will take you further, but probably use a similar amount of energy per kilo of body weight per step, and I reckon that's a pretty good thing to work from.

As before, though, taking those steps at a higher rate will burn more calories and exercise your aerobic capacity more.

Take an example. For the same person, walking 10,000 steps a day. Doing it in 3 hours (a gentle mosey through the countryside looking at flowers and smiling at squirrels) wouldn't earn you a single ""heart point"" and wouldn't get you out of breath at any point (unless you're a lot less fit than me, at least) whereas doing it in 1 hour would be something few people could actually achieve without specifically training for it, and would constitute a hefty dose of exercise.

The Google Fit app (which I used for my pace figures in the earlier post) has three measures and they honestly seem pretty sane to me (as a non-exerciseologist and non-healthatrician) - the app says the measures / targets come from the WHO so presumably they have some qualified don't-die-from-lack-of-exercise experts :-P

1. ""move minutes"" - the total time spent walking/running/cycling/swimming etc. (Default target 60 per day)

2. ""steps"" (Default target 10,000 per day)

3. ""heart points"" - you get a heart point for every minute of more vigorous exercise, (brisk walking/running/cycling etc. I think there's a threshold over which you get 2 heart points a minute, too) (Default target I think is 40 daily and 150 per week but I think I changed my heart points target and don't see a ""reset to default"" option to check)

If you hit all three of those, that probably matches pretty well with all the other measures we've been discussing and avoids the most egregious of corner cases.

It also has options to link with bluetooth heartrate monitors and the like, and to enter things like weight, height, body fat percentage, and even oxygen saturation figures if you want to get nerdier with it and have the requisite equipment...

I guess the slightly deeper question is what actually has a useful impact on health, and beneath *that* question is what we mean by ""health"".

Sitting or otherwise being inactive is physically bad for you, even outside of the lack of exercise, so move minutes are definitely meaningful. ""Heart points"" correlate pretty well with exercise that improves your aerobic capacity and that has wide ranging benefits throughout your body, not least giving you more headroom for times when you need to do more than your ""normal"" amount of exercise (like running away from a tiger?)

Any measure that equates to burning calories is a little more subtle. Like the aerobic stuff, just increasing your capacity for burning calories makes your body more healthy, even if you ignore weight concerns, but for those of us who are more likely to be *underweight* than *overweight* (and people with ADHD have two reasons to be in that category - hyperactivity and stimulant medication!) it's important to balance that out with eating enough, too!"
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"I think a combination of two goals (x steps in y minutes, or a miles in b hours) is probably closer to “useful” for most people. One dimensional measurements of activity just have too much variance when applied to a variety of complex systems like human bodies.

Also, the point about remembering to eat properly is very important for us. I lost a lot of weight when I really got onto a committed stimulant treatment, and most of that was the near elimination of my tendency to stress eat. I also just kind of… stopped taking lunch.

Maybe it’s just that “health” isn’t capturable in a simple, easily measured practice. We need to inspire people to want to be healthy, and get them to be more curious about how they could take care of themselves."
How the fuck do you guys sleep,"Yeah. Ditto most of that.

I've never been more than marginally overweight (never to the point that it's worried me) and have been underweight plenty. When I'm doing less well against depression (probably about half my life :-/) I often notice that I need to use a tighter notch on my belt (from forgetting / not bothering to eat properly) before I notice the other symptoms.

Somewhat uncharacteristically, I'm actually a little overweight at the moment, while having a shitty winter\*

There are those who do all sorts of healthy things (like taking care of what they eat, and doing lots of exercise) motivated by aesthetic concerns - gotta get bikini ready! I've never been one of those, I'm not really a vain person and don't much care much whether I *look* good, but the motivation I have is the wonderful feeling of *feeling* fit and healthy. Being physically strong, being able to walk / jog / whatever without getting stitches and out of breath. All that is a much better motivator for me...

What I find does well for me is just being generally physically active - walking / cycling when I could be driving\**, having a job that involves moving moderately heavy things around, being constitutionally incapable of walking at a dawdling pace... :-P

I use the fit app more as a way to remind myself if I've had a particularly lazy week that I ought to do *something* to keep the momentum going. Having a ""score"" is quite helpful in having something to ""beat"" and that score doesn't have to be all that sophisticated providing it does correlate with healthy habits to some degree, doing ""more"" is ""better"" even if you don't have (or put much weight in) a specific target...

The other half is that, rather than thinking about *how much* I eat, I try to focus on eating the *right stuff* (as well as bullying myself into bothering to eat at all, of course) I try to avoid too much sugar (not religiously, but I'll take a savoury option over a cake 99% of the time) and weight all my food toward slow energy release (high fibre, low sugar, a good amount of protein, root veggies...) because having a reasonably stable supply of available energy makes keeping doing stuff easier (both mentally and physically)

I'm perfectly happy with how this seems to be working for me, so all this stuff about measures for people in general is a little academic for me - I just can't help being a nerd :-P

--- 

\* Quite often, my brain / body seem to think that ""winter"" starts at the autumn equinox, presages an overriding need to ""hibernate"" and ends when it gets around to it (well into April it doesn't seem to have decided to) 3 years in a row, I was free of this particular turdnugget, but this year it decided to make a comeback tour :-(

I managed to crash my van in November (possibly partly because my brain wasn't awake enough to do a good job of driving because of hibernation mode) and am still trying to get my shit together enough to replace it and get back to work. \*sigh\*

\** Not while the lemon I bought instead of a van is pissing coolant, though. Know any good lemonade recipes?"

What do you take to go to sleep?,"Hey OP, sorry you are going through it. But I’ve struggled with sleepless nights for almost 10 years now and the best solution I could find was again melatonin. I know you said you tried melatonin but the thing that I found most effective is to just take 0.3 mgs around 8 pm and just go about your day. Most of the melatonin supplements that are available commercially are 3 mg and that is way too much for one person and it is just not healthy. Yes, they can make you go to sleep but they also give you the most vivid dreams and it makes it even harder to get up in the morning. 

What I found most effective is to cut off caffeine around 4 pm (especially if you’re using meds) and to take 0.3 mg of melatonin around 8 pm. (you probably can’t find that exact measurement but you can just take a little nibble off the 3 mg pill, which is what I’ve been doing for the past two years.) With this method, I usually get sleepy around 11 pm so I go to bed and fall asleep watching something I know that makes me relax (cleaning videos for me but it changes from person to person). 

In summary, if I take my melatonin about 8 pm I usually fall asleep around 12 / 12:30 am and I wake up around 8 am. Obviously, you can adjust the time according to your routine."

I don't do any of that of course. 😂 Won't make specific recommendations but obviously anything with a sedative element will help. Quietening your brain is the other issue. I like white noise. I also go sleep on the couch. Just changing where I am seems to help for some reason. 🤷🏻‍♂️ Usually wake up after a few hours, stagger back to bed and just go back to sleep."

Sometimes the music is that calming lofi type stuff but if my mind is more active then normal I go for something tribal with beats and vocals- love munknorr for this- or an audiobook that is just engaging enough to distract me.

One thing I've learned is that there is no one answer for me."
What do you take to go to sleep?,Trazodone
What do you take to go to sleep?,"I am the same way, and the edibles and melatonin did not work out well for me =\ But I do have a pretty solid method now:

TLDR: Magnesium plus an evening ritual/routine were key for me. The routine requires a cue, a set of tasks that can vary a bit but mostly stay the same, and a reward. I also needed regular mindfulness meditation and some exercise. 

Oh and a firm no-phone rule in bed! My partner can wind down with some scrolling in bed, so that is clearly optional, but screens just keep me awake it seems.



Full routine if you need ideas:

Almost all of my lights are on timers, so they start dimming or turning off around dinner time to cue me.  This also simulates sunset, so my brain knows it is time.

Sometimes I also have an alarm (that auto plays music), but sometimes that works and sometimes it is annoying. I try to go screenless once my lights are dim though, and typically plug my phone in to charge, so I won't keep using it.

The dimming lights prompts me to walk my dogs. Ideally I go around sunset, so my reward is watching the sunset and seeing the dogs happy both. 

Note: As I get ready to leave on a walk, I check the temp in the bedroom and open a window if the room is too warm (64-66F is ideal), so it will be cool by the time I go to bed. The dogs being excited keeps me on track.

When I get home from the walk, I do some dishes (or eat dinner if I haven't yet and then do dishes) and maybe another couple chores, all while listening to an audiobook or music going to keep me rewarded and focused. Chores stop roughly 1 hour before I want to be in bed.

As soon as I am done, I take my bedtime meds and vitamins (especially the Magnesium), and make some tea. 

Note: I keep all the stuff for this next to the sink, so it is super easy to turn and start tea and hard to forget my meds/vitamins. 

I sit in my dimly lit living room, maybe light a candle or some colorful twinkle lights, and drink my tea. I can journal, just sit and think, listen to calm music, or do yoga, but the tea gets drunk and the lights stay dim.

I have my phone screen set to go black and white about this time. 

On a brain-noise night, I am allowed to use the ""pause for 30 minutes"" option to turn color back on for a few rounds of solitaire or to join a TikTok live that I find calming. Nothing else though, and no more than 2 pauses allowed.

If I pause too many times though, I lose phone time after the walks. If I make tea time about my phone too many nights in a row then the following week-ish I either skip tea or make it a post shower, pre-meditation thing in the bedroom. 

Otherwise, once the tea is gone, I grab my PJs and head to the bathroom. 

This final piece came from a fellow ADHD friend: taking a shower or bath every night - yes even if you don't really need one. I don't know why, but this was the last piece I needed for sure.

I get the shower as hot as I can stand. This then makes me yearn for the cool bedroom, and the hot to cold seems to trigger sleepiness for me. My body naturally goes cold right before I fall asleep, so 🤷‍♂️ I now encourage that.

Note: I switch to music or silence during tea probably and definitely for my shower, because some audiobooks will keep me wired or wanting to read more. 

After the shower, I change into PJs and brush my teeth (still all in the bathroom). 

When I open the bathroom door, I give my cat treats (kept in the cupboard just outside the bathroom), so he now comes to get me if I am running late for the shower/treat time. He's very good at this job.

From there I go straight to my bedroom. I meditate, sitting up in bed, for about half an hour or until I am so sleepy I just cannot sit up any longer. Mostly I focus on my breath or body sensations. 

Note: if I am having a hard time meditating, I put on music again or a guided meditation (The Science of Enlightenment by Shinzen Young is especially potent). I also have a sleep mask with headphones built in, so I can put that on to keep my eyes closed and to listen to music/meditation guides/calm audiobooks until I fall asleep. 

When the brain noise is really bad even after 15+ minutes of meditation, I get up and take my ADHD meds, or maybe drink some coffee, but only try this if you can do caffeine naps. 

I hope that helps!"

What do you take to go to sleep?,"I have a couple of tricks. Well basically one of three things happens. Some nights I’m just so tired I actually have zero issue falling asleep but find staying asleep for over three or four hours hard. Those nights I am usually awakened by the urge to use the toilet, and then after all that I’m awake so I take melatonin and lay back down it usually kicks in within ten minutes and it’s back off to sawing logs.  Key is don’t open up the phone or even take it to the toilet. Anyway

The second thing is I’m wired which is typical and have been staring at some screen for hours also typical so I have to stop about an hour before bed and put the screens down and grab my bass guitar and throw on the head phones and groove myself into hypnosis and after a good 45 minutes of satisfying twiddly dees and I’m ready to lay down and sleep the sleep of ascended masters. 

The third is I take melatonin and force myself to turn everything off and lay there quietly until it kicks in about 15to20 minutes later and try to focus on just my breathing and trying to see how long I can lay still and feel my body melting away into a relaxed state sometimes it feels like I can’t feel anything and it’s kinda peaceful."

What do you take to go to sleep?,"Brain dump: Get the thoughts out before bed by journaling. Exercise and/or meditate and it will help too. When I really can't sleep I tell myself a story. Like, I watch a made-up movie in my head populated by people I know in fantastical situations. I return to pick up the story each night where I left off and it works like a charm."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"30mg of Mirtazapine 2-3hrs before bed, believe it or not... gives my eyelids that heavy & exhausted feeling and I drift off and sleep well. Only started them recently."
What do you take to go to sleep?,To be honest: orgasm. Knocks me out lmao.
What do you take to go to sleep?,"It's an interesting question. I learned about the circadian and ultradian rhythm cycles of the body. I learned that much of our rhythms are governed by metabolic cues. Anything that raises the metabolic rate is sort of 'saved' as a 'high energy time of day' marker. For example, eating and exercising. Now, the next hurdle was that even though I understood the concept of this idea, I needed to trust that applying this to my routine would be a good use of my time. What I did was apply the concept, i.e, established consistent eating and exercise times (within a reasonable degree of flexibility) then tracked the results using a spreadsheet/graphs. Turns out that it actually worked - and the data shows it. As a result, I now trust in this process."

What do you take to go to sleep?,"Magnesium, Trazodone, and Clonidine"
What do you take to go to sleep?,"About a year ago, I picked up a Bluetooth sleep mask and has been very helpful for me.   It took a little bit of trial and error to find sleep tracks that I can focus on, but aren’t too distracted, but I can go to sleep way quicker than I normally could have. Some nights are still tough of course but it definitely helps."

What do you take to go to sleep?,"struggled w insomnia for years. the only thing that helps me is treating my anxiety or mood w medication that also makes you sleepy. melatonin, benedryl, nyquil never helped. 

hydrozyxine pamoate (anxiety & antihistamine)
guanfacine ( ADHD)
Nortriptyline (for pain)
latuda (this one had me slumped the best, but took for mood, so not recommended unless you have other MH conditions)"
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Magnesium, wine lol"
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Turning the lights down after sunset (or after dinner, whichever is later) had the biggest effect on my sleep. I was absolutely amazed at the difference when I picked up a hobby that required brighter light. I immediately couldn’t sleep before 1 am, even if I went to bed an hour earlier. Many nights, I tossed and turned until about 3-4 am.

It sounds like you have insomnia, and I don’t, but If you don’t already turn your lights down in the evening as low and as orange as possible, definitely give that a try."
What do you take to go to sleep?,Clonidine
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Fake scenarios. Yesterday night I have a major fight with my cousin who was backbiting me with my sister(sister told me) and my non existent husband was very supportive while I confronted her in the mall, she was embarrassed. We sat in our car while I was crying, we then drove out and she ran out and threw a bag at our car from the back. All a dream."

What do you take to go to sleep?,My lates go-to is a Zinc and Magnesium supplement 30 min before bed and a YouTube video that isn’t too too interesting playing low enough to hear it with a sleep timer on.

What do you take to go to sleep?,"Hard exercise, preferably the gym, is the only thing that actually helps on so many areas. You need an outlet, and exercise calms the mind."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Audiobooks from Libby. (never ever audible) Started doing this after a brain injury and it changed my life. Now I almost always fall asleep in under 10 minutes. I get books I'm not interested in and/or books with magnificent narrators. Right now I'm listening to Gabriel Byrne's memoirs which is actually a delight but in the dark he can read me to sleep any night of the week. Thanks, Gabriel!!"
What do you take to go to sleep?,"I listen to the audiobook Treasure Island, as read by Jasper Britton. I have it set to turn off after 30 minutes, and I rarely make it past just a few minutes before I am out like a light. I’ve listened to the book all the way through countless times now, and I couldn’t give you a cogent plot summary if my life depended on it. ;)"
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Tried drinking to sleep, but that didn’t end up working out in the long term. Developed a drinking problem that was drinking 20+ drinks per day."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"I do a meditation, or (and this may seem strange) I think about how following problems:

* build a defense for a house in case of a zombie apocalypse 
* think about how to make a rail gun based on linear coils.

Somehow the thinking process for these specific problems helps me to fall a sleep faster."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"im prescribed clonidine which is a sedative that lowers bp reduces anxiety and is supposed to help with adhd 

thats the only med im on and it makes me soooooo sleepy you take it an hour before bed and once that hour is up i start feeling the most comfy and sleepy ive ever felt lol 

definitely helps anxiety and sleep but havent seen too much improvement adhd wise but for sleep its a good one"
What do you take to go to sleep?,"I listen to the same book series on rotation every night. At this point it almost immediately puts me to sleep. (Earth's Children series for me, but other series would work as long as there is enough books to not get too bored when you get to the end and restart and it's a series you've read enough times to zone our during.)"
What do you take to go to sleep?,"What works for me is waking up early and lots of activity and exercise through the day. 

Like most days I’ll do 45 minutes biking, an hour or hour and a half of strength training, an hour of walking or rucking, and then just generally keeping up with my kids. 

After that, at the end of the day I’ll read in bed and within 10-15 minutes I can’t focus on the page and it’s time to turn out the lights. Fall asleep no problem. If I don’t get the exercise in, I don’t feel tired until an hour or two after I otherwise would. 

Staying asleep can be a challenge. But usually I’ll just get up and go read in  another room until I’m tired again."
What do you take to go to sleep?,Audio books. Listen to something you know well so you're not so hooked you don't want to fall off and miss something but keeps you engaged. I've listened to Stephen Fry read Harry Potter god knows how many times at this point.
What do you take to go to sleep?,Doctors best magnesium glycinate is a godsend.
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Promethazine Hydrochloride (Phenergan). You can buy it over the counter in the UK, or order it.

What do you take to go to sleep?,Olly's sleep supplement works wonderfully for me!

On nights where I need to catch up on sleep and don't need to be awake the next morning, Zzzquil.   But that has lead to 14 hour sleeps before sometimes too."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"I’ve been using Mirtazapine for about 4 months and it’s been the only thing that’s worked for me long term without side effects. You can have really weird dreams if you take it, but that only happened the first week or 2 for me."

What do you take to go to sleep?,"Magnesium glycinate is the best presentation to get more relaxed, you should aim to get 200-300mg of elemental magnesium every night so read well the supplement facts as some presentations may be deceitful. Also mastering a proper sleep hygiene can do wonders for you. I could explain further if you have some doubts

Edit: i also avoid caffeine after 2pm."

Red light lamp instead of normal lamp.


No eating 2 hours before bed.


Weighted blanket and weighted eye mask.


Mouth tape and nasal dilators (bunch of options here)


Earplugs (find one that is comfortable)

And hopefully a cpap. Just got diagnosed with sleep apnea "
What do you take to go to sleep?,I find that if you go to a pharmacy and find the herbs and whatnot in the naturopath section that promise a calming affect its more effective than anything offering a sleeping affect. Sometimes I just need my brain to shut up not shut down.

What do you take to go to sleep?,"White noise sleeping buds + mindfulness training to focus on the noise and block out thoughts. Leaving phone outside of the room.

I also really like listening to guided sleep meditations. I really like Jason Stephenson on youtube. 

Box breathing 

The whole “5 things I can see 4 things I can touch” thing

Visualizing a specific relaxing space I created in my head. It’s in Hawaii hahah. 

Basically any grounding and/or meditative practices can really help. 

Also, not to sound like a boomer, but turning off your phone an hour before you plan to sleep. I can’t lie, I don’t do this, but I’ve done it before and it HELPS. Also reading before you sleep! Reading can make you sleepy!"
What do you take to go to sleep?,"White noise from my Google or Alexa device has really helped. I rotate between birds, thunderstorms, and trains"

Today, my new prescription for hydroxyzine came in. So I guess we'll see how well that works."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"1.5 to 2 hour walks alternating daily with 1.5 to 2 hrs of intense physical fitness. It’s pretty much the ONLY thing I’ve found to knock me out, as most of the meds I’ve been prescribed for sleep, cause me to be depressed the next day for some reason."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Trazodone & Clonidine

I also listen to white noise and read on my kindle before bed."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"I listen to bedtime stories or “sleep stories”. Huge game changer for me. Gives me something to focus my brain on to keep it from wandering, but the stories are strategically not interesting enough to keep me awake. Sometimes I do have to force myself to really focus on the story, but their drowsy calming voices generally put me to sleep in minutes. 

Meditating or focusing on breathing doesn’t work for me at ALL. I need an outside narrator to keep me on track. And an audiobook or podcast can keep me awake if it’s interesting. Sleep stories hit just the right kind of boring enough."
What do you take to go to sleep?,3 mg of lunesta and a bunch of other stuff that should make me “sleepy.” It gives me a short window to fall asleep but that’s about it.
What do you take to go to sleep?,"I’m technically taking generic Paxil but it doesn’t really  do much anymore.

And I know this isn’t “taking anything” but there’s a YouTube channel called Stephen Dalton, he tells relaxing stories, mostly bedtime, but they usually start with relaxation sessions and while the stories are varied and nice I usually fall asleep before the stories even start 😆. His voice is hit or miss for some people (my husband hates it, but I find it super soothing)"

What do you take to go to sleep?,Hydroxyzine; it helps me with anxiety and makes me sleepy.
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Beam dream powder. 


You can get their official stuff or mix it up yourself to put in your tea or something. 

It knocks me out and has completely replaced my other sleep aids AND I'm not drowsy in the morning. Plus, I get to sleep within 30 minutes"
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Depending on the night and situation, I take either melatonin gummies (5-10mg), chelated magnesium, or unisom (never all three, only one). 

For me, unisom causes some kinda weird dreams, and if I take it too late at night, I might be a little groggy the next morning, but other than that, it helps me sleep."

What do you take to go to sleep?,"I feel you. I’ve struggled with delayed sleep phase disorder for many decades.

Are you on meds or off stimulant meds?

If it’s off meds, it’s easier with some good practices and hacks.

Take 200-400mg magnesium (depending on if it makes you poop too much) and 15-30mg zinc with dinner or before bed. Don’t take B6 (this often comes formulated with mag and zinc) as this will wake you up.

Melatonin is very hit or miss for me too. I wake up with a brain fog and kind of groggy. You can also decide to look at your phone for 30 min longer and skip through the effects and screw your self. I’m not a fan. The ADHD book I read recommends Tryptophan instead of melatonin. It is a melatonin precursor. I think it may work better if your body makes and converts it instead of dosing it directly.

During sleep, wear an eye mask or use black out curtains. Make your room cool (like below 68 degrees f). Wear ear plugs or use white noise if you’re sensitive to sound. Your room must be pitch dark and cool like a cave. If you get dry mouth like me use a humidifier (50-70% humidity is good).

Ideally no electronics in bed but I have no self control. If you can’t stay away from your phone, set it to the lowest brightness and try black and white mode too. It won’t wake you up because it’s hella dim. It’ll strain your eyes. I personally get so frustrated, it makes me put my phone away and go to bed, so it works for me lol.

In the morning, make sure you get 5 minutes of sun light first thing you do upon waking up. Don’t miss it. You can go back to sleep if you want but just look at the sky first.

Also avoid alcohol or heavy greasy foods before bed. Just don’t take anything before bed except select meds and your magnesium/zinc. I’m very sensitive and most things will wake me up if I’m digesting it.

All this is if you’re not on stimulants.

Now for stimulants…I don’t really have an answer for you.

Unfortunately, if you’re on Adderall, there is nothing that will keep you asleep short of benzos or some other medication that will have side effects. They literally prescribe amphetamines for narcolepsy to keep people awake.

Hydroxizine works but it also made me hella groggy waking up. I am able to fall asleep using the supplements I mentioned and taking the stimulants early but I can’t stay asleep for more than 5 hours. There is still l-amphetamine in my system and it keeps my heart rate elevated and my sleep light. I’ve tried the vitamin C trick to prevent further amphetamine absorption but it doesn’t really work that well for me. (Actually TBD because I drink Emergen C powder and that stuff has Vitamin B in it which keeps me up).

Dexamphetamine will be a bit better on sleep and Ritalin will be even better. 

Clonidine (and to an extent guanfacine) as someone else mentioned works wonders but it disrupts REM sleep for me. I sleep longer but wake up groggy and not feeling well rested. You can also form a dependence on clonidine if you do this every night. I took it for months and it took me 3 weeks to get off of it."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"I got some headband headphones and play meditation sleep music. I sleep better than ever,"
What do you take to go to sleep?,I take 3mg of melatonin and 25mg of hydroxyzine.
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Good ol seroquel XR. Makes me sleep like a baby. 

It’s not recommended for insomnia alone though, but it’s the only thing that actually stabilizes my sleep. I’m also taking it for psychotic symptoms/OCD/mood stability"
What do you take to go to sleep?,"QUESTION, I used to think intense daily exercise was the only way I could sleep but once I get in the habit of this I start feeling drained and like it doesn’t even help anymore. Maybe I am looking for affirmation but is there really no way out of the sleep issues if you have ADHD? I always blame myself for not being more active. I’m also basically unemployed right now so maybe my brain just never gets tired"

What do you take to go to sleep?,Sleep? Who here gets any sleep?
What do you take to go to sleep?,Trazodone for insomnia. I have been on it since forever. Haven't changed the dose in well over a decade. Works great.
What do you take to go to sleep?,I use prazosin to help with nightmares and it also helps me stay asleep all night! Without it I wake up 3-5x between sleep cycles
What do you take to go to sleep?,"I’ll drink a cup of tea caffeine doesn’t affect me at all then I’ll swing in my sensory swing for a hour I’ll usually fall asleep in the swing or I’ll jump on the trampoline for a bit, shower and sit in my chair and I’ll be out. Also I put some baby powder in some socks and will wear those too"
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Clonidine.

Used to help, now it doesn't really do much, maybe makes it a little bit easier to sleep."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Klonopin as needed. It’s a daily med for anxiety and panic but I save one for nighttime to help me sleep. 

Yes, I’m aware of the dangers please don’t worry about me or feel the need to lecture me about them. I’ve tried everything else."

What do you take to go to sleep?,"First thing I’ve tried - Clonodine. 50mcg (smallest possible dose) once at night an hour or two before bed. 

Not only did it help my sleep onset, it helped keeping heart rate and blood pressure down the following day and stabilises my mood - it has dealt with my anxiety and potentially even my depression. My Dex is potentially slightly reduced in potency, but overall, it has been life changing.

Oh and also, I do all the usual sleep hygiene stuff. I’ve got automatic, rgb bulbs throughout the house that goes red 2 hours before sleep. I goto sleep the same time every day. And I exercise. It’s all very worth it."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Amitriptyline and box breathing helps me fall asleep, and the medication makes it very easy to fall back asleep as I wake multiple times per night. Occasionally I will have to use a PRN klonopin, but that is usually only when my anxiety is acting up hardcore."

What do you take to go to sleep?,"I listen to [boring books for bedtime](https://www.boringbookspod.com/) to recreate that feeling of being in a boring lecture when falling asleep in class is suddenly easier than staying awake lol

The podcast is _just_ interesting enough to keep my mind from wandering too far, but too boring to get invested in and keep me awake. And if I still can't sleep, learning about the history of bread or whatever is a much nicer experience than spiralling in silence."
What do you take to go to sleep?,Trazodone
What do you take to go to sleep?,Not being on any tech an hour before bed and allowing myself to wind down...
What do you take to go to sleep?,"First thing, take a low dose (1-3mg) melatonin around a half an hour before you want to start falling asleep. Don't take gummies, they're too inconsistent.
I take ambien cr which knocks you out and keeps you out. 
Unisom (doxylamine succinate ""sleep aid"") is also a good one for OTC. 

But the goal is to take the low dose melatonin to start winding down then take the sleep aid when you're about to be serious about sleep; about 10-15 mins before actual bed time. 

All of this is of8 you can't take any kind of edible due to sensitivity or profession."
What do you take to go to sleep?,Listening to ASMR especially whispering and personal attention
What do you take to go to sleep?,My cousin had these weird 7 in one (or maybe 8?) herbal pills; I think they were CVS bran? I took one when I accidentally took an Adderall at night instead of the meds I was supposed to take 😭. I really really really didn't expect them to work. Melatonin doesn't work on me so I doubted some weird herbal things would do any good. I was wrong. It worked perfectly and put me to sleep pretty quickly.
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Im prescribed 50mg of trazodone nightly, but I rarely need to fill it because when I take it I only take 1/4 or 1/2 at most inw emergencies because of how heavy and hazy it makes me for all of the next morning, even seems to layer over my Dexedrine. If I'm having trouble, my first go to is 2mg melatonin and some valerian root capsules. The sleepytime extra tea doesn't seem to do much for me, but the capsules do. I also can't sleep in silence, but the sounds have to be only low frequencies with no light sources. My husband insists on playing the TV to sleep without a timer all night and will turn it back on if I turn it off. So usually I've got a good comfortable total blackout sleep mask, an earbud playing a low voice narrated audiobook in one ear and an earplug in another. 

Now I that I've said all that and read it back, I think I might be a fussy sleeper 😅"

What do you take to go to sleep?,"Getting a CPAP machine. I used to drink a double espresso and then take melatonin. Since getting my CPAP I get in bed and listen to an audiobook till I am hitting the point where I am yawning, put my mask on, set the sleep timer on the audio book I had been listening to to 10 minutes, and turn off the lights. Most of the time the next day when I load up the audiobook  to continue listening I have to go back a few minutes to find where I dozed off. 

This blew me away. I have tossed and turned in bed for HOURS every single night for at least a decade. If I woke up during the night I struggled to fall asleep again. Now I fall asleep in minutes most nights, and sleep through the whole night. It's crazy. 

Of course, getting a CPAP is dependent on actually having sleep apnea, but if you think there's even a mild chance you do, please get tested. It has improved my life in so many ways, and being better rested makes it easier to handle the other.. uh.. quirks.. of ADHD."
What do you take to go to sleep?,4mg melatonin at 6pm the Clonidine at bed time (also helps with restless legs)
What do you take to go to sleep?,"My Grandpa also had ADHD and would drink coffee all day long on the farm.  Grandma wanted him to get healthier sometime in his 70s, which involved quitting smoking (smoked since he was 12), quitting red meat, and quit drinking coffee.  He stopped smoking cold-turkey with few cravings, refused to quit red meat (he was a farmer after all), and quit coffee for a while, but stopped being able to sleep at night.  It turns out, if he didn't get a cup of coffee right before bed he couldn't sleep.  For me it's sugar.  If I have a hard time sleeping, I eat something sugary and it seems to help.   Burning flowers or edibles also helps, but I don't always hit REM sleep with that.  

  
You could also try sleeping in a spot you usually don't.  I find that if I start snoozing in a spot I usually don't sleep in, my brain thinks it's being rebellious and goes along with it."

What do you take to go to sleep?,"I don't take anything I play things to listen to. Not any of that meditation music, doesn't work to sleep. I play things I am so familiar with I don't pay it any real attention. So for me that's certain British radio comedy's, particularly ""the Unbelievable Truth"" with David Mitchell. I dunno what it is about his voice but it's relaxing 😅.

Anyway, point is listen to something that you know really well but it shuts your brain up because it's attracted that part of your brains attention just enough to shut it up, and you drop off. 

Important thing to say though, nothing with screens, cover it up if you have to.

Basically stuff you like that your brain will shut down to."

I'm on 20mg for the moment, but at 10mg there was also a positive effect on my sleep.

What do you take to go to sleep?,I am the same. Daydream for atleast 40-60 mins then wake up next day. Sometimes I think going to bed an hour before you want to sleep is a good idea. But occasionally I hear my alarm go off in the morning and I’m still trying to sleep. I think of this as being a part of ADHD. Try to take medication earlier in the day if you take meds. Just life at this point don’t know what to say
What do you take to go to sleep?,"I used to take OTC sleep aids, usually diphenhydramine or promethazine, but they made me really groggy so I would only take half the dose/tablet. But I didn't like that while they helped me fall/stay asleep, my quality of sleep was still shit. 

Now, I take magnesium, L-tryptophan and ashwaganda 1-2 hours before bed, and drink a night time tea about 1 hour before - usually something with valerian, passion flower or chamomile. I try not to use my phone for 1 hour as well, and read instead. 
I have an app that plays loads of different sounds, and I can't fall asleep without the ""storm"" sound on.

I think the supplements and tea help, but I'm definitely trying to work on having a good bedtime ritual e.g., going to bed at the same time (± an hour) and improving sleep hygiene."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Valerian root tablets, magnesium tablets and white/pink/other colour noise! Or music. Sleep headphones are really comfy, can buy them on Amazon"
What do you take to go to sleep?,I dont. I use external audio stimulation (a youtube video with a bluetooth sleep mask as to not disturb my husband) and it knocks me out.
What do you take to go to sleep?,"I imagine things, I have elaborate worlds and stories in my brain. Funnily enough it usually takes me like 15 minutes so I don’t actually like get lost in them. I don’t think that works for most people though.

Have you tried guided meditation? Because it’s actually totally ok that your mind wanders, that’s kinda part of it, your mind wanders and you accept the thoughts acknowledge them and that allows you to move on from them. That and focusing on breathing (so something else). That part takes practice because it’s hard not to judge yourself (at least it was for me at the start) “I’m breathing too slow, too fast” “oh fuck another thought, I got distracted”. So it’s practicing to get to the point of just observing it “that happened, let me move on” like without judgment (like don’t beat yourself up about it).

Edit: typo"
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Have u tried white noise? It works when our heads get too loud, it really helped me in a phase where i couldn’t sleep. I was having similar issues to u, was able to sleep only for 50 minutes and in that too i dreamt."

What do you take to go to sleep?,"Weighted blanket and melatonin (melatonin sometimes, at a time I took it every night until my body kind of got used to it so that I started to get sleepy without melatonin around the time I normally took it).
But buying that weighted blanket has made huge difference with me - it helps me calm down I guess and I fall asleep pretty quickly, before I could stay up few hours!"

What do you take to go to sleep?,"I’m about to change your sleep world, so listen up.
If your problem is your thoughts, here’s what you do.
- close your eyes (this doesn’t work with eyes open, even to practice)
- think of the first word that comes into your head
- think of another word which is not connected to the first
- repeat for a time, say about 50 words.
- stop and rest.
- if in 5 mins you’re not asleep, try with a longer time period.

* if it is actually connected, don’t worry and overthink it, just go to the next word.  It’s not about being perfectly disconnected, it’s about a sequence of roughly jumbled words.

What this does (I call this mental shuffling) is make it impossible for your brain to gain coherence and think of anything.  The jumble of chaos also mirrors dream state.

For some reason I always start with the word “avocado” and I like this as it also acts as a trigger."

What do you take to go to sleep?,"Melatonin, scary podcast and regular bedtimes."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Prep:  No caffeine after 1pm, It’s easily my biggest disrupter. I also do my absolute best to maintain timing - routine begins no later than 8 if I can help it, I am horizontal by 9.

Intake: Magnesium, zinc, clonidine (off label to assist with falling asleep), buspirone (off label to relieve anxiety/slow racing thoughts), other assorted meds/supplements.

Actions:Screen time ends 45 minutes before bed. Nighttime routine begins with a hot, hot shower to relieve body tension and ends with quiet time while watching my Phillips Sun Lamp in sunset program.

Environment: pitch black room, carefully regulated temperature, blankets of preferred weight/warmth, and a soft reiki soundtrack that has been playing in the background of my home for the last 15 years of my life.

If I can align *all of these* and reassure myself that I have an uninterrupted 8 hours, I actually sleep peacefully (most of the time).

**However,** my fiancé (also adhd) just needs to put his feet up on a semi-horizonal surface. Nbd. So you know… ymmv."

What do you take to go to sleep?,My doctor gives me muscle relaxers for my concurrent fibro as well.  I also have cyclobenzaprine but I only take those when I don't have to open the next day as they make me super groggy and foggy the next day.

What do you take to go to sleep?,Magnesium and RSO!
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Going through awful insomnia at the moment. We simply haven't cracked that code yet, there are no pills that will give you a good night's sleep, especially not reliably and without addiction. 

Tried out zopiclon, zolpidem, quetiapine, doxylamine succinate, melatonin and herbal supplements. The first two work.. for a couple of days, but the quality of sleep is awful, and the hangover significant. And if you take those pills and don't fall asleep, you wish you hadn't. Some people report great success with quetiapine, I think it's hit and miss, and the potential side effects are interesting, to say the least. It's also not necessarily easy to quit quetiapine, although they're supposed to not have the same addictive properties as benzo and adjacent meds.

If they work, sleeping aids knock me out so I don't have to experience the desperate boredom of insomnia. But I don't sleep well on them. Also, when you think you haven't slept, you've probably slept a little bit. True sleeplessness will kill you fairly quickly."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"My doctor prescribed me Clonidine and Gabapentin to calm my brain down at night. I tend to drift, but I am groggy in the mornings. It's hectic cycle."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"#1 for me, in recent years, has been audio books. Throw something half interesting on, and it distracts my racing thoughts enough and prevents my thoughts from ruminating. I'll fall asleep quicker than with any drug.

#2 magnesium bisglycinate. Take it every night 2-4 hours before bed. It's probably half placebo, but it helps me relax.

#3 L- Theanine. Don't take every night, but sometimes when I think i might need a little extra help to relax, I'll have before bed.

#4 Diphenhydramine. Only take if i know i won't sleep because of over stimulation, through medication or anxiety. Find it always works well, and it's shorter acting than most antihistamines, so there's no grogginess the next day. It's important not to take more than a few times a month, though, because it can cause cognitive decline."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Melatonin, 90 kilos -> 10 mg"

What do you take to go to sleep?,"I have a clipboard and little neck mounted reading lights. I do EASY crossword puzzles (Monday or Tuesday only) and when I start nodding off I put everything down and fall asleep quickly. I’ve been doing this for about 10 years now and it’s the only thing besides scrolling on my phone that keeps my mind occupied enough while my body powers down. 

My only other advice is physical exercise during the day. A little physical exhaustion goes a long way when it’s sleepy time."
What do you take to go to sleep?,Bluetooth eye mask + soundscape or audiobook I know pretty well. As a 30+ year old man Stephen Fry reading harry potter to me as I fall asleep is pretty relaxing

What do you take to go to sleep?,"Audiobooks only of books youve already read. Story and interest is still there to keep your mind occupied but not a new book since that can be too attention grabbing. I've been cycling through the Harry Potter, Twilight, and Hunger Game audibles for 4 years. Going without them to fall asleep to was probably my biggest fear surrounding my voluntary inpatient psychiatric admission. 😬"
What do you take to go to sleep?,"I go to bed earlier than I need to then watch YouTube until a set time. Work nights I stop after 30 minutes, usually 1130-1200 at the latest, preferably 1030-1100. I also use a noise machine so my brain can’t run away. Thunderstorm sounds are the best"

What do you take to go to sleep?,I take Catapres (clonidine) and it works really well. I tried melatonin but it made me sluggish the next day. Catapres was originally used for controlling blood pressure but was found to work well at relaxing the mind and allowing sleep. No slugginess the next day. But I will say this - don't stop taking it abruptly. I ran out of tablets 5 weeks before seeing my dr and thought I'd be ok. But it had a profound impact on my mental state and I spiralled into a withdrawal type of reaction. I got back on it and was fine in the space of a week.
What do you take to go to sleep?,"I always meditate or listen to sleeping meditation. 5 mins and I'm gone
I usually am awake and hour or something too when I don't listen to music or whatever, due to daydreaming or having songs stuck in my head, which is annoying and keeps me awake"

What do you take to go to sleep?,"I use an app called Loóna and it’s absolutely amazing. Or on YouTube Micheal Sealey has absolutely life changing guided sleep meditations. Never once have they not knocked me out. Btw I have ADHD and do take a stimulant during the day, have struggled with sleep issues my whole life. Now I know if I get up and go to bed, get comfy and turn on either of those, I will for sure knock out within 20-30 mins maxxx. Usually more like 5-10. It helps so much cause u focus on what you hear instead of your racing thoughts or desire to stay up and watch more tv etc."

What do you take to go to sleep?,"Guanfacine has helped me immensely. It doesn’t make me sleepy per se (after the initial onboarding), but really helps my overactive mind and helps me to be able to relax. I still do need to take sleeping meds occasionally (especially when the days get shorter), but I can’t speak highly enough about how guanfacine has improved my life with ADHD. I take vyvanse in the morning as well - the combo is working great for me!"
What do you take to go to sleep?,"I take Seroquel. My Dr initially prescribed it for sleep, and it works really well. I think it was around 50mg-100mg. I take a higher dose now but that is because I started feeling 'normal' after I began taking it. That's how I discovered I was bipolar."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"I’ve struggled with this for years too, but I recently established a routine that’s helped me tremendously. I start with my nighttime skincare routine and put on a YouTube video to stay focused and entertained. Then, I dim the lights, take my magnesium, and put on something relaxing to watch—a calming TV show, some YouTube vlogs, or a documentary. Within about 45 minutes, I’m usually drifting off. I used to roll my eyes when people recommended routines like this, thinking they wouldn’t work for me. But now, I’m genuinely excited to wind down every night, and it feels great."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Clonidine. It’s not a standard sleeping pill. It’s non addictive. And i only take one when nothing else is going to work. None of the sleep hygiene stuff works for me. It only frustrates me more. Because my brain still races. I did it all. I also tried prescription melatonin. But no. I’ve struggled to sleep when i was a kid. Before mobile phones. Before bad sleep hygiene. This is just me. No amount of “good sleep practice” helps. I have a circadian rhythm that kicks in later than most people, which doesn’t help. And i don’t sleep for that many hours either. I find acceptance of my reality is much better than trying to fit in to social norms"
What do you take to go to sleep?,1mg mg melatonine works for me.
What do you take to go to sleep?,That Mary Ruth magnesium drink. Listeeeeen. I’ve tried melatonin and doctor prescribed medication ambien. This one literally takes 10 mins and I am scrolling on my phone and my body says no to my phone…… no to my phone? Since when ? It dosent taste amazing. It’s coconut. You can mix it with some juice but it will knock you out. I even tried checking the label for hidden sleeping agents. It’s just magnesium and other essential vitamins. So I’m getting sleep and staying supplemented. ![img](emote|t5_2qnwb|29379)

What do you take to go to sleep?,"Ativan if it’s anxiety/adhd looping but I try not to do that because it’s a controlled substance and only want to use that in emergencies…. I learned something on TikTok where you think of a RANDOM word with each breath and the words cannot be related. You spend so much time thinking of the words it occupies your brain to keep away the random thoughts and eventually you fall asleep. It works really well!! So like do a regular inhale and just think “in” and on the exhale think “laptop” then on the next inhale think “in” and on exhale think “muffin” then on the next exhale think “purse” … if you think “laptop… mouse… keyboard” you can’t do that because it’s too easy for your brain, it has to be completely unrelated words. If you find yourself not thinking of the words and back to other thoughts then you just yell at yourself to refocus and start again without repeating. It sounds literally ridiculous but it’s worked really well for me!! I haven’t been able to go to bed and fall sleep without laying awake for at least an hour for my entire life… I’m 32 and this is the first thing that actually works for me"
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Sometimes the focus on your breath, keeps you up. You’re not drifting off naturally because you’re not letting your mind wander. I personally take melatonin and take magnesium and nighttime. It seems to help me fall asleep fast and stay asleep. I take Magnesium malate and I make sure it’s 100% of my daily allowance."

What do you take to go to sleep?,"For a while I was taking amitriptyline for headaches, and that was knocking me the fuck out. It's typically a migraine medication though, and if you do anything like I do that involves some organization like the FAA, it will flag you just as badly as ADHD meds do. It's fantastic, but only if you have headaches and need help sleeping."
What do you take to go to sleep?,100mg of Trazadone
What do you take to go to sleep?,Trazodone 100mg and a children’s melatonin. Works 95% of the time.

What do you take to go to sleep?,Read or phone while laying down until I can’t keep my eyes open anymore. As long as I am actually laying down in bed that tends to naturally happen within a half hour or so.
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Nothing, I wait until I can’t keep my eyes open on the couch, drag myself to my bedroom, then listen to YouTube for an hour before I can fall asleep again. 

It’s a great way to live."
What do you take to go to sleep?,Trazodone changed my life
What do you take to go to sleep?,Lots of exercise and watching matches of StarCraft

What do you take to go to sleep?,Got prescribed trazodone
What do you take to go to sleep?,Xanax.
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Seroquel unfortunately. I have a substance use history and they give that out like candy to addicts. I’ve heard from tons of doctors and others on it that it’s a terrible medication for sleep, being that it is an antipsychotic. Almost always causes weight gain because it makes you eat so much junk before you go to bed. It makes me crave cookies, ice cream, etc and so I wake up most mornings needing to shit my brains out.

TLDR, if you can avoid it, don’t take seroquel for sleep."
What do you take to go to sleep?,50mg seroquel
What do you take to go to sleep?,Delta 8 gummies and a shot of zzquil.
What do you take to go to sleep?,I have a medical maryj prescription so I usually eat an edible in the evening to chill out and go to bed
What do you take to go to sleep?,"I used to think chamomile was nonsense until one day I had a chamomile tea at a cafe and I couldn't stop yawning. The difference was the amount of chamomile they had used, it was a considerable chunk around 2 tablespoons. So it's been my goto for sleep cause nothing else seems to work especially due to my messed up sleep patterns from PTSD. I sleep for 1 night and stay awake for 2-3 days, that's been my routine for the last 7 years"
What do you take to go to sleep?,How many mg melatonin?
What do you take to go to sleep?,I listen to sleep stories on the Calm app or YouTube. I sleep on my side and pop one ear bud in. It's literally the only way I can sleep these days. They take my thoughts away from my own thoughts and are boring enough to ignore when I start drifting off. For close to 40 years it took me at least an hour or more to fall asleep. Now I'm out regularly in 15 mins
What do you take to go to sleep?,Trazodone. Before that benadryl
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Interesting history podcasts at 80% speed, sometimes a beer. 

It doesn't work with uninteresting podcasts though, I will just think of something else. They have to be super interesting, and slowed down so that I will breath with the narrator. The trick is to quiet my mind for long enough so that my body can get a few hours rest."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Sonata. It has a short half life so I don't have to take it unless I need it, but if I've been lying there for ages and it's 2am, I know I can take it and still be awake in the morning. Helps you fall asleep, not stay asleep though."
What do you take to go to sleep?,Dex / Vyvanse
What do you take to go to sleep?,"If you can go to the doctor, there’s a muscle relaxer that knocks me right out… and I have a very high tolerance for medications. It’s called Tizanidine, and I normally only need one 4 mg tablet. Just make sure you’re already in bed or you might end up passing out wherever you are. Can’t tell you how many times that has happened to me… but it works!"
What do you take to go to sleep?,Benadryl or Advil PM
What do you take to go to sleep?,I take a small dose (like 1/3 my prescribed dose) of my short-term stimulant if my brain is too active to let me sleep.
What do you take to go to sleep?,"I do no caffeine after 3:30 and I'm careful with the timing of my am meds so they don't impact my sleep. If I'm a little hungry, I have a small snack before bed, otherwise this will keep me awake. I do a bedtime routine where i take the nighttime meds before i brush my teeth. I take 3mg of melatonin (don't get weird dreams from it, but I do from other things) and magnesium. 

I put everything I need is right on the night stand: water, mouth guard, lip balm, kindle/book, phone on night mode, and earplugs.  I have hydroxyzine 25mg (I do 1/2) or Clonapine (super low dose like a 1/4 of a .5mg) at hand if I'm really worried I can't sleep. I haven't needed either very often lately. I put the light out & read my Kindle or do a crossword puzzle both in dark mode & zero brightness. (Reading something really boring can help if you're desperate.) I put in my earplugs & mouthguard. It's usually about 5 minutes and my eyes are wanting to close. I put the reading or puzzle down & I'm asleep in like 2 minutes, per my husband's report. He's always amazed! 

If I feel really enervated, I dance, stretch, exercise, or clean for a while until I feel ready to go on the bedtime process. 

I know some of these things are counter to frequently cited sleep advice but this has been working for me consistently for at 4 or 5 years. Good luck!"
What do you take to go to sleep?,Quetiapine (seroquel) 50mg! I fall asleep fast and don’t wake up during the night.
What do you take to go to sleep?,[removed]
What do you take to go to sleep?,"L-tryptophan and magnesium glycinate. If those don’t work, I have clonidine as a back up."
What do you take to go to sleep?,Trazadone
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Nothing, i have peace

But total darkness is necessary"
What do you take to go to sleep?,Zoplicone for sleep
What do you take to go to sleep?,Noise! I can't sleep in a quiet room. I usually sleep with a fan on or theta sound waves on my phone.
What do you take to go to sleep?,"The best thing that aided my sleep is actually becoming aware of the things I was thinking. If I noticed that I was trailing off into weird thoughts or visualizations I was close to falling asleep. Noticing imaginary noises etc. Once you can be aware of those things and let it happen, I found I could fall asleep way easier"
What do you take to go to sleep?,Nothing makes me sleep better then being tired. Nothing makes me tired more then physical activity. Drugs should be unnecessary.
What do you take to go to sleep?,I would try a non stimulant medication like Clonidine or Intuniv (guanfacine). They help with a lot of adhd symptoms but the symptom I found they helped the most with was sleep.
What do you take to go to sleep?,"1 gravol, water, and minimum 1 hour of down time - meaning zero interaction with ppl either over text or in person, and put on one of a few standard shows I've watched a zillion times already on lowest light and volume, while I use a phone app to do jigsaw puzzles...it puts me out every time. I also use a weighted blanket. Sleep hygiene goes a long way in helping get to sleep. A few websites have tips, and also keeping a record of what's worked and what hasn't helps to narrow down what works for you. 

They always say no screens, but that isn't the case for me. I need 2 to get my brain zoned out enough to finally shut down. 

Patience is key, as you're trying to train your brain into having cues to fall asleep."
What do you take to go to sleep?,Also another thing that works for me is putting on any Alan Watts lecture. Just go to YouTube and type his name in. Some have a dark screen just to help you go to sleep. Something about his voice is soothing. He also has some very interesting ways to look at life in general. One of the great philosophers of out recent time.
What do you take to go to sleep?,Mirtazapine mostly or valium when I can get it and have a nice lay in on weekends
What do you take to go to sleep?,"This randomly works for me. I go through my days activities from the moment I open my eyes to the moment when I lay down. Like the whole 12-16 hours I’m awake. I don’t go into emotions or how I felt because then I start to drift into emotional world. And my emotions are what’s keeping me up in the first place. I just go over the actions of my day like I’m watching myself in a movie. I don’t talk, just visualize. 

Example: I’ll visualize how this morning I woke up,  checked my phone time, tried to close my eyes for another five minutes, felt uncomfortable, got up from bed. I checked my emails then I got up to use the bathroom. Then, I wash my hands.  I brushed my teeth and face. After that I crawled back in bed and scrolled through my phone, checking my other apps. Got up, got a glass of water, then looked at the time….. I continue going through the tasks that I’ve done in my day and somehow my brain gets tired and forces me to go to sleep. 

It’s like I’m taking control of my brains activity by giving it a task to do rather than it scrambling off on on its own accord. 
I don’t give myself a physical task otherwise that would keep me up, and doing something like reading is too much excitement for my mind that i’d just stay up. But I found this to work for me maybe it’ll work for you."
What do you take to go to sleep?,Hydroxozine
What do you take to go to sleep?,"My psych prescribed me 25mg of Seroquel, I cut it in half. Kicks in after 30 minutes and then I listen to a comedy podcast to drown out my thoughts or I just scroll through Instagram reels until the meds make me pass out."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"My combo lately is magnesium + using sleep headphones and a sleepy podcast. ...and then like, sleep hygiene more generally. I find that if I get my stuff ready for bed earlier in the evening, at a time that I'm actually energized, then by the time I'm going to bed I'm not running around trying to get things set up and cozy, cause its already done. Also reading a book instead of scrolling TikTok for even just 10-20mins before bed seems to prime my brain to lean into being sleepy instead of remaining keyed up."
What do you take to go to sleep?,Hydroxyzine. It’s an antihistamine used calm anxiety and induce a drowsy state. I’ve had trouble getting consistently good sleep since my TBI 8 years ago and this is what has helped me the most.
What do you take to go to sleep?,50-100mg Seroquel
What do you take to go to sleep?,Indica
What do you take to go to sleep?,"I use the melatonin spray instead of pills, because you can adapt the dose. You can use up to 4 pumps and I usually need 2-3. with 4 I get those dreams too and I hate them because they are stressful (not horror). But with 3 I am still safe."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"I've trained myself to fall asleep when lying on my left side, so I find that I just go to bed, get in the right position and boom.

I do try to kill screens about 1/2hr before going to sleep, and chill for about an hour before that just watching Netflix in the lounge..."
What do you take to go to sleep?,I would suggest rubbing castor oil on your stomach and in your belly button. It’s been know to put people to sleep. And taking magnesium glycinate  an hour before. The combo should put you to sleep.
What do you take to go to sleep?,Caffeine naps are the best! My psych at one point mentioned Ritalin as a potential sleeping aid as it makes me sleepy if I take too much 😅
What do you take to go to sleep?,"My wife always gets perplexed…”Don’t drink that you’ll be up all night!” **Sigh* Honey how many years have you known me?

*Next* you’re going to tell me to just go to bed earlier to wake up earlier and feel less groggy? We have different brains woman!!"
What do you take to go to sleep?,As an energy drink or just normal coffee? And any specific amount?
What do you take to go to sleep?,There’s a reason why this works for some with ADHD - the extra caffeine helps your brain move a bit faster so the more you keep up with your thoughts the easier it is to unwind and sleep.
What do you take to go to sleep?,It's a thing that for some people with ADHD caffeine has the reverse effect.
What do you take to go to sleep?,Yes! Me too! I thought I was the only one.
What do you take to go to sleep?,Really intereing I have a cousin so big on coffee that she discripte the same experience and she seems fine even though I warned her that her sleep quality is affected never the less. Did you try decaffeinated coffee? -As I'm really curious and can't imagine how to sleep under caffeine !
What do you take to go to sleep?,This is genuinely so real I had to stop drinking coffee to help me study like everyone else bc it made me take the legit best naps everytime and I was so confused 😭
What do you take to go to sleep?,I drink Sneak sugar free energy and it makes me nap in an afternoon.
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Magnesium has worked best for me. Edibles definitely help to fall asleep, but if used long term, they can decrease sleep quality. Probably better than no sleep, though."
What do you take to go to sleep?,How much magnesium? I’ve tried it but doesn’t seem to do anything
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Thank you, Magnesium was unknown to me. Again thank you."
What do you take to go to sleep?,Like no devices chair chilling? Cos I can see this working for me. My biggest culprit when falling asleep is trying to bore myself to death listening to annoying shows lately. But if I sat in total silence with no distractions I’d probably realize how tired I already am.
What do you take to go to sleep?,That's a really interesting strategy regarding the comfy chair. I think I'll try that.
What do you take to go to sleep?,Box breathing?
What do you take to go to sleep?,Edibles is the way.. when it kicks in.. it’s 1.5 hours of movie in bed and then pass the fuck out lol.. usually only do it on weekends though.. could probably bypass the movie and just pass out in weekdays if I wanted I guess
What do you take to go to sleep?,What kind of chair
What do you take to go to sleep?,Don't recommend edibles - you'll fall asleep but the quality of sleep wont be good. Don't recommend doing this often
What do you take to go to sleep?,"It made me *so* groggy the next morning, but it does make me fall asleep.  I switched to melatonin."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"It’s crazy how everyone responds to medication in a different way. I took trazodone for a year and it made me anxious and gave me restless leg syndrome. Xanax worked the best but I can’t get my doctors to prescribe it because i’m “taking stimulants”. I haven’t taken it in 10 years and could really use it. It pisses me off that people who don’t really need it, and abuse it , and then get addicted, ruined it for those of us who truly need it to make their lives better."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Same. Works great at bedtime, but then in a few hours.....awake."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Same same, it covers the first 3-4 hours of the night but if something wakes me up after that (peeing, train, kids, etc.) it's hit or miss as to whether I'll be able to go back to sleep.  I take 100mg, I used to take 150 mg and that would last more like 4 or 5 hours, but it made me groggy in the morning."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"This is my issue. I fall asleep no problem. Staying asleep all night, my kryptonite. I wake up multiple times nightly and it’s so frustrating"
What do you take to go to sleep?,It's done wonders for me.
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Hey. I been using this some time ago as Tritico but had terrible next day. Felt sleepy and tired also headaches. Dosage 1/3 of a pill. 
Now as I got diagnosed with ADHD I started using it again to fall asleep. Unfortunately side effects came instantly. Do you feel it same way? Or maybe different dosage will do the trick? My friend had it prescribed as well but she said 1/3 gets her all sleepy but whole pill helps her to sleep at night but then she wakes up fresh. Can you relate?"
What do you take to go to sleep?,Saaaaame
What do you take to go to sleep?,"I find that it helps me to stay asleep. Dayvigo has worked well for falling asleep. Unfortunately I can’t take them both, otherwise I’d have the best sleep!"
What do you take to go to sleep?,I am using quetiapine
What do you take to go to sleep?,I actually split my trazadone into two doses for this reason! I take half when I’m getting ready for bed and when I wake up at 4am I take the other half. My prescriber encouraged this and it works pretty well for me. I usually wake up at 8am & think my body just metabolizes it faster. I also take my stimulants right away in the morning so that probably offsets any grogginess.
What do you take to go to sleep?,Same here but it just makes me so groggy in the morning it's not worth it.
What do you take to go to sleep?,Same
What do you take to go to sleep?,Modinfil is the literal stay awake pill.
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Reading is a great go to. 

Fantasy novel? Potentially an hour. 

Self help book? 5 mins.


Except the one night that the self help book actually engages me and then I'm awake for 3 hrs"
What do you take to go to sleep?,Reading is known to help you sleep:)
What do you take to go to sleep?,"I read as long until my eyes are getting sleepy, then I close them an think about what I have read"
What do you take to go to sleep?,"this! I've found that reading nonfiction that's a bit hard for me helps me fall asleep.Not super handy if you're reading for an assignment though - it took me 3 years to finished reading Jared Diamond's ""Collapse"" as it was such a snoozer. It has to be something I'm interested in, though, otherwise I won't be going to bed for it...

Recently my 8 year old discovered something similar. I give her ""The Borrowers"" and she would rather read a David Baddiel novel her older sister likes because ""it's boring so I can fall asleep faster instead of staying up reading it""."
What do you take to go to sleep?,Agree. An O does the trick. Scientifically proven too.
What do you take to go to sleep?,I recently tried this but the constipation and bloating is a deal breaker for me. I liked it because I did fall asleep super fast
What do you take to go to sleep?,i was on clonidine for a long time but it would make me so sleepy during the day i used to take 2-3 naps a day and when i got off it that stopped happening. didn't connect the two until after i got off it
What do you take to go to sleep?,"this advice should be rated higher, these are the best long-term solutions!

additives are the worst way to solve this.  they make your body dependent or addicted.  i'm shocked by how many people are suggesting additives on this post."
What do you take to go to sleep?,Solid
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Sleep hygiene is key, I saw a sleep therapist about CBT fir sleep, and that was one of the key things we worked on."
What do you take to go to sleep?,All this plus a vape that makes you really sleepy so when you wake in the middle of the night you can take a big rip and pass back out instead of having an adhd brain party at 4am. 🙃🫠
What do you take to go to sleep?,"I tried Ambien for a total of 3 days. Took it like I did my trazadone (take it, bath, bed). By the time I was going to bed I had an argument with my stuffed animals about not wanting to lay on them. Woke up between my bed and wall. Next night, bath then take medicine, everything was fine. Third night I was interrupted. Went back to my room and stuffed animals were talking to me again. I called my boyfriend (now husband) freaking out. THEN ONCE STUFFED ANIMAL CONVINCED ME MY BOYFRIEND WAS TRAPPED IN MY PHONE. And I had to pour glitter on my phone to get him out. It didn't work. He spent 3 hours calling me down. 


Woke up pissed at the waste of glitter. Never touched the shit afterwards."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Ambien is the most effective overall for getting a full night's sleep, at least for me and I've tried just about everything. Still causes a bit of grogginess in the morning, but just about every benzo is worse (some WAY worse). And you have to make sure it doesn't become habitual.

The most effective thing I've found for *getting to sleep* is Zaleplon. It will only guarantee one sleep cycle (90 minutes or so), but it has a very compelling advantage -- *no grogginess in the morning* \-- **none.** So if *sleep* *onset* is the problem, Zaleplon is the winner by far."
What do you take to go to sleep?,[deleted]
What do you take to go to sleep?,I’m so thankful for Ambien
What do you take to go to sleep?,"I was on them for years. Then they stopped working. I then learned how addicted and dependent on them I was.
Then I got to experience the withdrawals... The withdrawals legit have caused trauma, to the point where if I now don't fall asleep quickly or even don't feel tired when I go to bed I legit have a panic attack and think I'll never sleep again.
They gave me a life when they worked, I haven't slep like that any other time in my life, but they also have robbed me of alot of things, and they stop being your friend after a while..."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"That stuff can be deadly (although I am enjoying the funny stories here). 

Years ago, here in Australia, someone fell over their balcony when sleepwalking on it. Others reported sleep binge eating, but worst was someone who sleep DROVE."
What do you take to go to sleep?,Hydroxyzine for the win!
What do you take to go to sleep?,Yup! Enjoying my sleepy time tea now actually
What do you take to go to sleep?,I came to recommend hydroxyzine too.
What do you take to go to sleep?,Tension Tamer Tea is really good for relaxation too.
What do you take to go to sleep?,Are you not worried about the anti-cholinergic effects and there link to dementia with long-term use?
What do you take to go to sleep?,This is what im prescribed on top of the adderall…a huge win if you have allergies too 😂
What do you take to go to sleep?,What does hydroxyzine do? I don't think I've heard of it.
What do you take to go to sleep?,I found that those ‘walking’ videos on youtube helps a lot.  The ones where they just mindlessly walk around the city.  I guess the ambient city noises does the trick for me.
What do you take to go to sleep?,I use an air purifier that has just the right amount of brown noise for me.
What do you take to go to sleep?,real. i cannot sleep if my brain is louder than the environment.
What do you take to go to sleep?,"my bed routine is to go through podcasters and YouTube documentaries about interesting enough stuff, exactly like ancient cultures, debates on how the pyramids were built or why the sphinx's head is not original design, etc. Sometimes it takes too long to find. ya and maybe if it's too interesting it's harder to fall asleep."
What do you take to go to sleep?,[deleted]
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Careful with this one. Anticholinergic drugs have been associated (in multiple studies) with a significant increase of risk of dementia. Bear in mind it’s an increase of 50ish (depending on study) percent, but of the existing risk of dementia, so not an absolute risk of 50%.

Poor sleep is also a risk factor, so weigh your options, but it would likely be best to find a different class of drug.

Some other studies report it only impacts long term users: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7033580/

It’s just worth considering if you have other options."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"I’ve already taken mine. I love Unisom because I can take early enough in the evening to still function, but when I do go to bed, I’m out…and sleep all night."
What do you take to go to sleep?,Wish I had discovered Unisom years ago instead of only a couple weeks ago. Works like a charm
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Also unisom, take 5mg edibles as well if I have a crazy day."
What do you take to go to sleep?,Doxylamine or diphenhydramine unisom?
What do you take to go to sleep?,Is this the one that’s the same as Benadryl
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Lucky. I wish I could tolerate antihistamines but they somehow gear me up to where I can't sleep at all. First time I tried hydroxyzine I couldn't sleep for 3 nights and on the morning of the 4th my doctor had to call me in a heavy duty rescue med to get me out 😩 Same effect from unisom, benadryl or anything else just not as long lived or intense.  Crazy jimmy legs though ugh like I'm trying to run relays in bed."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"This is smart. I used melatonin for a while and it always made me feel super fucking groggy the next day, also crazy dreams, or if I still couldn’t sleep it would make me feel wierder/ crazy as the night go later"
What do you take to go to sleep?,"I’ve read/seen stuff about be people misunderstanding how melatonin works. the idea is that you want to train your body to produce it at a certain time not that you want to get all the melatonin you need from a single pill. That’s why the lower dose works. It’s meant to signal your body to start producing it on your own.

Not sure if I’ve gotten entirely right, but I thought it was interesting."
What do you take to go to sleep?,Yup! I use the melatonin gummies but I only take a quarter of a gummy and that will get me to nod off but not be groggy in the morning.  Working out in the evening also helps.
What do you take to go to sleep?,They sell it by 0.1 mg in the Netherlands. I just buy them in bulk from there. Many Dutch melatonin brands also sell exactly in 0.3 mg
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Wow, I always have used melatonin as the “just before sleep time” to try and ease my mind into sleep, I’ll try taking it earlier to see if it makes a difference"
What do you take to go to sleep?,Yeah benzos help. I was on them for 6 months and came off them about 3 months ago. Had horrible suicidal thoughts for a week as a withdrawal symptom. Best is melatonin / magnesium glycinate / trazodone / doxylamine and winding down an hour before bed. Do something you find relaxing. I find progressive muscle relaxation helps.
What do you take to go to sleep?,"I once took xanax to bed, uhh i didn't sleep very much that night, thats how i found out that benzos dont help me sleep, idk what purpose would they serve in my life"
What do you take to go to sleep?,Same!!!
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Same and same. Idk, maybe ADHD has helped me into being an alcoholic. I'm working on it kinda. I had a week shy of 3 months until a few weeks ago. Anyway"
What do you take to go to sleep?,Same and it sucks. Trying to switch to edibles but vodka has worked for years……
What do you take to go to sleep?,Same… I recently started switching to HOP WTR though and it seems to help with sleep.
What do you take to go to sleep?,Same. Totally get why re addiction.
What do you take to go to sleep?,I took ONE benzo and had these psycho evil terrifying dreams. Never again !
What do you take to go to sleep?,I took ONE benzo and had these psycho evil terrifying dreams. Never again!
What do you take to go to sleep?,I totally do this as well. There are certain games that are repetitive and soothing. Word games work for me. Puts me right to sleep.
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Wonder if there's a better way to do this, using e ink screens or something?"
What do you take to go to sleep?,How does magnesium work? How much and how is it taken? Any brand you recommend?
What do you take to go to sleep?,Same. Helps me go to sleep and has improved my sleep quality.
What do you take to go to sleep?,same
What do you take to go to sleep?,How long does it last in your system? Feel groggy 8 hours later/ is it hard to wake up?
What do you take to go to sleep?,"I looooooved how I slept with mirtazapine, but unfortunately I gained so much weight and I couldn't keep buying new pants"
What do you take to go to sleep?,My doctor put me on 7.5mg to help with sleep cause it's more drowsy in lower doses. I was completely sedated for two days i hated it so much haha. Felt like I was trapped in sleep and when I was talking on the phone with someone they asked me if I was high (despite never being a drug user) because it affected me so much I was slurring my words and not able to answer questions. Never again for me 😅
What do you take to go to sleep?,Just emptied my glass! Need to take off my contacts and then I'll probably be knocked out in ten minutes.
What do you take to go to sleep?,Which ones are sleep stories?
What do you take to go to sleep?,"The sound of someone reading me to sleep keeps me from thinking/overthinking and there are no side effects, no prescriptions, and it costs NOTHING if you use Libby (or hoopla) , you can get them from the library and there are tens of thousands to choose from. Even in languages you don't know. It used to take me 2-3 hours or more to fall asleep but this pleasant sound has made it so I just dive right to sleep. Turn the lights off, climb into bed, get cozy, set a timer on the audiobook and it will automatically shut off."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"I'm on Seroquel's neighbor, Olanzapine.
When I started taking it I would drop dead for 12 hours. Two months later, I became largely tolerant. Antipsychotics are definitely not a long-term solution."
What do you take to go to sleep?,That’s so funny because last night I took my 20 mg XR because I hadn’t slept in a few days and when I’m exhausted  already my ADHD medication will knock me out —that and strong coffee are the only things that reliably put me to sleep — my brain is very weird
What do you take to go to sleep?,I also use silicone earplugs.
What do you take to go to sleep?,Works incredibly well!
What do you take to go to sleep?,Doesn’t the sleep mask irritate you I tried these sleephone knock offs
What do you take to go to sleep?,What is rso?
What do you take to go to sleep?,Meditation music
What do you take to go to sleep?,I wouldn’t take that long term can cause dementia. Look into it.
What do you take to go to sleep?,"I forgot...and I sometimes use Melatonin drops...faster absorbed 

I haven't used MMJ in a while...but if I have too many bad nights (4-5days of <6hrs sleep)"
What do you take to go to sleep?,"My psych prescribed me 25mg of Seroquel, I cut it in half. Kicks in after 30 minutes and then I listen to a comedy podcast to drown out my thoughts or I just scroll through Instagram reels until the meds make me pass out."
What do you take to go to sleep?,A nappuccino in the afternoon is lovely!
What do you take to go to sleep?,This with adderal can knock me into a coma
What do you take to go to sleep?,"My sleep inertia confuses everyone. Standing motionless in the shower, staring at the wall because I forgot why I’m there, and then shampooing my hair twice because I forgot I already did it. Brushing my teeth twice in the morning isn’t going to damage me, but accidentally taking the same pill twice and double dosing has caused a lot of damage. And it’s worse the earlier I get up."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"One Monster used to mellow me out. Two would knock me out.

These days I take Trazodone."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Sugar free too. You don't want that in you. I use a powdered energy,called Sneak,as its cheaper and you can dose it as we or strong as you like."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Stimulants definitely don’t have that sleep effect on me, but this is a great explanation for how they decrease my anxiety"
What do you take to go to sleep?,Do you really think so? Better sleep- is that what you mean by unwind? What an idea. Genuinely intrigued.
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Edibles sometimes have the opposite effect on me, they give me anxiety"
What do you take to go to sleep?,"been using edibles to sleep for almost a decade, everyone is different i suppose"
What do you take to go to sleep?,If I use edible more than 4 nights in a row they stop doing anything. But on rough crazy brain nights there's nothing better.
What do you take to go to sleep?,"I do take magnesium, but usually with dinner.  Didn’t know it could help with sleep.  Otherwise I take melatonin.  It doesn’t make you sleep, but (at least for me) definitely helps."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"350 mg, solray, magnesium glycinate. this is the one for sleep."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Same, what dosage are you using?"
What do you take to go to sleep?,"I have been trying a magnesium L-threonate drink powder (144mg) about an hour before bed. My PA, who prescribes my lisdex, recommended it as the kind that crosses the blood brain barrier the best. It has helped me a lot with sleep and semi restless legs before/at bedtime.  This type also has the least laxative effect than most other kinds of magnesium.

Before that I had tried magnesium glycinate (220mg), which also worked for me pretty well. I might go back to that cuz it is cheaper than the L-threonate. 

I tried a different drink mix, mag carbonate/citrate, it did not work for me, at all."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Right. The key is to become hypnotized by your thoughts, sometimes I’ll do that while box breathing, I also make sure it’s dark and I recline slightly in the chair, it’s like going to bed without actually going to bed, takes the stress off. 

when it’s time to get up and actually go to bed, I have to be careful to not trip or fall because I turn into a zombie recovering from all that thinking"
What do you take to go to sleep?,"A read somewhere giving your mind permission to think helps, and that was just my take on it"
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Breathe in through the belly for about eight seconds, hold for about eight seconds, breathe out for about 8 to 12 seconds, count eight seconds, repeat. There’s lots of variation on timing so adjust what works for you."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"The kind that lets you sit, lol. No, really what would be ideal is a La-Z-Boy recliner or similar"
What do you take to go to sleep?,Same & gave me bad migraines. Had to go to melatonin and sleepy time tea
What do you take to go to sleep?,It put me to sleep but I woke up regularly (and usually took another melatonin) 
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Where did you get melatonin? Some can get from the Dr but other can’t, depends where your Dr is. It’s frustrating."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"I’m on a stimulant but I get panic attacks. Sometimes they are annoying and I tough them out, but sometimes I need a Xanax. My psychiatrist has given me prescriptions for both. Maybe because I don’t want it as an every day thing?"
What do you take to go to sleep?,You can also die from your body being reliant and then not having it and then….. blablabla. Xanax was my favorite 😍 I knew once I had a taste …. I suffered from anxiety all my life because for the first time I felt normal. Not drugged just in an acceptance of reality. Buuuuut I knew that was too easy….. and life has lessons and lessons can’t be skipped. lol. But later when I’m older I’m gona slide in my Drs DMs with a swift….. beam me up Scotty!!! And finish life on a bit here and there. I’m talking wayyyyy older. Like take me to heaven old. lol. Rn. Anxiety will be the “motivation” or the fire under my assessment period.
What do you take to go to sleep?,"I’ve had this issue for so long the last 4 years. It is unbelievable how many docs refuse to prescribe it despite trying every other method, especially if it’s the only med that works for you. I have ADD and panic attacks/GAD and many other issues lol. Finally found a doctor who actually LISTENS and had no problem giving me my adderall and Xanax."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Trazodone makes my heart race, Mirtazapine gives me a god awful hangover, Hydroxyzine doesn’t work after 2 nights. Valium/Xanax work like an absolute charm but obviously doctors rarely prescribe these as long-term options anymore. 

The only way that I’ve been able to sleep consistently is to switch to an instant release and I take my 2nd dose 3-4 hours after my 1st instead of 6.

My bedtime on work nights is 11pm so I also don’t drink caffeine after 1pm."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"People with ADHD are the most likely to develop an alcohol use disorder, and I imagine that extends to Xanax misuse/recreational use since they both affect GABA-A in the brain. Now, don’t even get me started on stimulant abuse. I’ve never once felt even remotely euphoric in a stimulant and I think it’s psychotic to abuse them, snort them or whatever people do with them.

Also, I too was told I could not take Xanax for sleep because I was on a stimulant, but I truly believe that Xanax is the most dangerous drug, and you can’t even take it for more than like 3 weeks every day without developing a tolerance to it that will cause withdrawals. Benzo withdrawals can last for up to a little over a year, but it wouldn’t last that long if you were taking it for a couple of weeks. There’s a lot more as to why benzos are so dangerous, but I won’t explain that here.

I take hydroxyzine 12.5mg for sleep and it seems to work best. Benadryl can also work, I’d just be worried about its long term effects on memory, but there’s no withdrawal and it works super reliably.

Essentially, here is the order in which medications would be tried for insomnia. Working in a pharmacy, as a texhnician, in my opinion, this is the safest route to go. This doesn’t include less screen time, red filter on iPhone, consistent sleep time, hygiene, different stimulant med schedule, exercising, diet, no caffeine after 1pm, environmental changes, temperature changes etc. which can greatly help.
Tea
Valerian Root
Melatonin
Benadryl
Hydroxyzine
Doxylamine Succinate (this will knock most people on their ass)
Trazodone
Doxepin
Mirtazapine
Quietiapine
Zolpidem (ambien)
Eszopiclone
Some sort of benzo, probably not Xanax, maybe temazepam but only for the short term
Maybe a less potent benzo
Xanax
Or specialty med that I can’t remember the name of

Xanax should truly be an absolute last resort."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Not sure what dose 1/3 pill would be, but 50mg is what I was prescribed. My doctor said 25-75mg is the typical dose range for sleep, so perhaps I could ask for more. Other than the initial drowsiness at bedtime, I really don't get side effects."
What do you take to go to sleep?,My therapist says that the horizontal back-and-forth eye movements of reading mimic REM sleep; that's why it works.
What do you take to go to sleep?,"It’s funny , cause I’m  that weirdo that it energizes . Totally opposite effect"
What do you take to go to sleep?,It works for me almost instantly but I have to get up to pee a few hours later
What do you take to go to sleep?,That used to work for me but now it seems to wake me up more
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Ohh that is such a shame, have you tried melatonin? I cannot take it unfortunately as it causes headaches."
What do you take to go to sleep?,please do elaborate
What do you take to go to sleep?,"thats odd.. were you taking it during the day? from my understanding, the main point of clonodine in consistent use for sleep is that it doesn't make you feel sleepy when you wake up in the morning like other things ive tried e.g phenergan and temazepam. i only take 0.05mg even tho i was prescribed 0.1mg, generally 5 - 20 minutes before i go to bed, and it is the best thing i've tried."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"magnesium helps but yeah, def don’t start by taking melatonin every night"
What do you take to go to sleep?,"yeah but when you're taking other prescription meds that are preventing you from sleeping, sleep hygiene doesn't cut it. I do have good sleep hygiene, and started on vyvanse, even once all other effects had worn off, i could not sleep. like for the first time ever i REALLY got what insomnia is like. I mean up since 6am, at school all day and then at work and completely exhausted, lying in bed from like 10pm through to 2:00am without a wink of sleep, followed by really fragmented sleep until i got up at like 7. 

sleep hygiene and essential oils were not gonna cut it. Maybe now i've been on my meds for longer, i could try without sleep meds (clonodine) and i have a feeling it would be a lot better now, but sometimes, as cooked as it is, the best solution to a medication issue is another medication. From my pov, i could be on a LOT worse stuff (ambien bro 💀 thats cooked) and getting shitty sleep would probably be just as bad if not worse than taking prescription sleep meds."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"that word is too coded, and many are unsure about what it means in practice. simply put, what are you currently doing to help or not help you sleep, and what could you shift slightly to help you prioritize sleep, prepare for sleep, and stay asleep."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Never tried it, and docs have given me (and the DW) a plethora of different benzos. Tbh I found the most effective for sleep aid is temazepam, and that was the first benzo prescribed to me, due to my symptoms of total insomnia (before medication for ADHD)"
What do you take to go to sleep?,I woke up last week and found that I had used my tanning drops on my face and it was not a quality job.  It's only now starting to fade.  I looked like a Trumpian Picasso.
What do you take to go to sleep?,"It treats Anxiety , Allergies & it helps you sleep."
What do you take to go to sleep?,Also known as Vistaril. I was given this for crippling anxiety a few years ago. I could not tolerate benzos so this is what worked for me. It is an antihistamine.
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Ohh I’ve never seen this- can you recommend any, please? This sounds amazing. I’ve got limited mobility these days and kids so I’m not able to get out much but my favorite thing is to wander around cities and towns."
What do you take to go to sleep?,[deleted]
What do you take to go to sleep?,Doxylamine. That's the only one you want. Diphenhydramine is benedryl
What do you take to go to sleep?,"No, benadryl is diphenhydramine. Unisom is doxylamine. I use generic from Walmart or Costco. Works the same for 1/2 the price"
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Probably. 

That's what I used to use"
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Same. I don’t like melatonin. Groggy and yeah sometimes weird dreams.

I think you can give l-tryptophan a try. It is a precursor to melatonin and other neurotransmitters. Maybe it works better if your body makes the melatonin instead of you directly taking it."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"That’s right as far as the articles I’ve read also said. Our body naturally produces melatonin but for various reasons (in our case the meds we are using and our ADHD) can effect when and how much it is produced which determines our sleep cycle. 

That’s why it is widely called as a “supplement”. Our body only needs a tiny bit to start producing it on its own."
What do you take to go to sleep?,Honestly working out in the evening messes up with me. I get so tired so on one hand I really wanna sleep but on the other hand I just can not fall asleep for the life of me 😂
What do you take to go to sleep?,"They dont even sell melatonin unless you have prescription in Ireland. I’m Turkish so I get mine in bulk when I go to Turkey, but that means getting the 3 mg is better cause I get more that will have to last me for a whole year. 

Wish they sold 0,1 or 0,3 here too"
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Earlier and much smaller doses, the 0.3 mg you take practically just signals your brain that it should slowly start producing the melatonin"
What do you take to go to sleep?,Yeah benzos do indeed help but they are such sneaky backside that you dont realize until you've created a habit of them. Really why putting emphasis for people to not try it and just take any other road there is.
What do you take to go to sleep?,Yea. I blame covid. I didn't drink much before then.
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Alcohol works for a while, but I've found eventually causes problems worse than not sleeping."
What do you take to go to sleep?,Maybe I'll look into that. Thanks!
What do you take to go to sleep?,"I didn't understand it because I used it only a few times and only for sleep.

But apparently people use it to delete their  anxiety. And that can make you braindead if you use it daily.

I have met several people that abuses it and some of them are really the worse."
What do you take to go to sleep?,Hmm. Can you play games on those?
What do you take to go to sleep?,I'll answer! Magnesium glycinate. About 400 mg. Solray is good and Nutricost brand is the one that I love the most. Just make sure it's actually fully glycinate and not a mix.
What do you take to go to sleep?,"It’s not hard for me to wake up because of the medication. I’m just not a morning person 😅 I would say no grogginess after 8 hours, I am only groggy when I first take it at night."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"I had the same thing.. a double whammy, as it both increased appetite & slowed appetite.. initially around a kilo a month weight gain! once I realised what was happening, I curbed my appetite, but still gained weight, just more slowly."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"same except I started at an even lower dose. Felt like sleep chased me down and put me in a headlock. Eventually, I slowly went up in dosage (~ 10x the original dosage) and it's been fine."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Ha I started on 15mg, but it only made the left side of my body sleepy... quite literally as if you drew a vertical line down the middle of me. Upped the dose and worked perfectly. But the heavy eyelids when you first wake, wow! Hard to describe 😂"
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Look up Sleepy: actual literature. The guy has a deep voice, and apparently, women dig it, lol. I Can't Sleep: just a guy reading Wikipedia entries. Weirdly this is one of my favorites. Get Sleepy: written stories specifically to lul you to sleep. They are just interesting enough to stop the loop in your head, but meander along so you just can't keep track and you doze off."
What do you take to go to sleep?,Not at all. I have a narrow head so it doesn't feel uncomfortable.
What do you take to go to sleep?,I have and have been taking it for over 10 years for my illness
What do you take to go to sleep?,Nappuccino. I'm so appropriating this.
What do you take to go to sleep?,"That speaks so much to me…

I got the old persons weekly medicine case which helped (just gotta remember to actually fill it lo)"
What do you take to go to sleep?,Oh man accidental double shampoo for life! Also have the old man pill organizer!
What do you take to go to sleep?,"I have the same. Definitely doesn't help me sleep, but 2 coffees in the morning was how I was able to cope with my morning anxiety - because that's when mine was the worst. Something about natural cortisol levels after sleeping made my anxiety spike every morning....only thing that ever helped was coffee."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"I can’t find the article anymore - it said that for most people with ADHD it can make sleep harder but for a subset of people with adhd and sleep issues the caffeine can calm them and help them to sleep.  

I wish I could find it - it was a very nuanced take."
What do you take to go to sleep?,Me too! I go to a dark place.
What do you take to go to sleep?,Taking sativa or indica? That’s probably a key point.. indica would help you sleep better.. sativa gives me energy and a little paranoia
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Me too! If I stop taking them, they work again in a few weeks though."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"How much you taking? I don't even eat entire 5mg gummie,  just a small bite to feel effects"
What do you take to go to sleep?,"You cant deny the fact that you build up tolerance over time, plus if you go laid them off cold turkey you won't be able to concile sleep properly for some time. 
Getting more high in order to achieve sleep it is not always the answer"
What do you take to go to sleep?,"I take 500 and it doesn’t help, lately it’s been making me light headed though so I’m cutting back"
What do you take to go to sleep?,It definitely doesn't help trying to quieten your brain down. Just does the total opposite in true ADHD fashion.
What do you take to go to sleep?,Ok so is it like meditating?
What do you take to go to sleep?,What country are you located in? I am in the US and we can get melatonin at any store that has a vitamin/supplement aisle. You could also order online from Amazon or anywhere else.
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Yeah it’s sold over the counter here but they officially gave it to me in the hospital when I spent a week there a couple years ago, too."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"personally, in addition to my daily stimulant, i’ve been able to take xanax as-needed for years for my panic attacks. i hate how groggy it makes me feel, so i’ve never taken it more than two days in a row, and i’ve never felt like i was dependent on it. but benzos are definitely not to be fucked with"
What do you take to go to sleep?,Then you have to do it the second or third time.
What do you take to go to sleep?,I just wait around and pee before I hit the bed.
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Gotta do it again, until it hits you."
What do you take to go to sleep?,I don’t like melatonin. It doesn’t keep me sleep
What do you take to go to sleep?,I take clonidine 150pg at night and Ritalin during the day. It works really well at relaxing my body and slowing my mind down after the Ritalin wears off.
What do you take to go to sleep?,"I started with .1mg and thought it was really odd I was super constipated and as a result, bloated. Even laxatives didn’t work. I looked up side effects and sure enough, constipation is listed. I tried splitting the pill in half and even fourths. 

I’m seeing my pysch nurse this week to see other options. I already take Adderall which affects my appetite & I work out a lot so constipation and bloat is awful for me because as a result, it’s hard to eat/consume enough calories"
What do you take to go to sleep?,"no, i only took it at night before bed. my friend had the same thing happen as me, he's the reason i got off it actually, and then i noticed a difference. i'm glad it's working for you though!"
What do you take to go to sleep?,"sleep hygine or CBT? sleep hygine I like, you have to clean away the bad habits. Congitive behavorial Therapy is a bit more confusing but its mainly just what you said as well, making adjustments in  how you approach sleep."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"There is a lot, but I prefer the ones that are more aimed at ambient sounds.

Here is one in rain:  https://youtu.be/YFZf0vpUmms?si=LhncJCDUif0ODQ1r

And this type I enjoy too, it has a good amount of real city sounds (snow, cars, people walkings/talking): https://youtu.be/4TkoCHIQe4A?si=_2rX0PhWiMtS7t3d


There are people posting these types of videos from almost all cities.  Not sure why, but I find it really soothing."
What do you take to go to sleep?,Yep! Agreed.
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Yep! Just making sure, a lot of people are unaware"
What do you take to go to sleep?,Oh I will knock tf out as soon as I am horizontal
What do you take to go to sleep?,Ya but I said long term. So in your 60s+.
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Drink a coffee, take a 15min nap, wake up refreshed and ready to go again!"
What do you take to go to sleep?,"I have those, but I’ve convinced myself it’s “wrong” when I’m groggy and gone ahead and messed up anyway ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)"
What do you take to go to sleep?,10mg
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Unless, like pretty much everything else we’ve evolved to consume, there’s a balance and proper day to day equilibrium that can be found in some, if not most, people"
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Get good quality magnesium glycinate capsules. Take them 1 h before bed time. Otherwise try the magnesium spray which is absorbed through the skin. If your body cannot absorb it, then it cannot ‘metabolise’ it"
What do you take to go to sleep?,Try switching brands.  The last one I tried I had horrible leg/foot cramps daily. No issues after I switched and sleeping better. Or try a magnesium complex. I'm currently halfway through my first bottle of [this one](https://a.co/d/6R4GbOJ). I started with just one capsule a night for a few weeks but sometimes I take two.
What do you take to go to sleep?,Damn you are so lucky! I’m from the UK. 🫤
What do you take to go to sleep?,thanks :) no i meant the other person who said something about constipation and bloating
What do you take to go to sleep?,What time you take it? I normally take 100ug clonidine RIGHT before bed as I find it helps me stay asleep.. rather than at 830 then it wearing off by the time I wanna go to bed at 11-12am
What do you take to go to sleep?,Try asking about guanfacine. It did cause some constipation for me but it passed after a couple of weeks.
What do you take to go to sleep?,"sleep hygiene, i mean. there are no bad habits, because we develop them based on a need. if i go around looking to clean up bad habits, i miss the root cause and just shame myself for the symptoms.

for example if there’s a bad smell in your house and you get a candle, you’re not addressing a root cause like taking out the trash regularly."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"This is awesome. You get the enjoy the scenery and look around without having to worry about not walking into traffic/ not running into other people, etc. it’s so relaxing! I want to find other cities now, too! Like parts of India."
What do you take to go to sleep?,Forgive my language but lucky bih 🤣 Honestly if exercising caused that effect I’d exercise everyday and not move once every two weeks 😂
What do you take to go to sleep?,I understand. I've always had mental illness on and off. I was a RN for many years. Now have had agoraphobia for going on 5. I am 50 yrs old
What do you take to go to sleep?,I love this!
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Yeah that's a ""I ain't doing nothing for today except video games, vegging or a nap"" dose for me personally. Every body's different."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"oh I'm sure I'm absorbing it, I've been having low blood pressure issues, and we are thinking its the magnesium. I take this 500, get another 400 from a multivatmin, and get like 400 from food. In general your only supposed to get 400-500 total. You generally pee out the rest, but it makes sense I'm light headed all day until it gets around nighttime"
What do you take to go to sleep?,Thanks. There is a lot of good info in this thread and it’s timely since my appt is next week!
What do you take to go to sleep?,"Lmao that’s what the bih is there for!

I only recently got fully medicated so I am now trying to work in the exercise so I CAN knock out, my main issue is that my workday ends at 9 which is when my gym closes ;_; I know a gym isn’t necessary, but I like to swim.  Working out in the morning is just gonna make me wanna eat and nap lol"
What do you take to go to sleep?,"That is far too much, indeed! I take one capsule in the evening, 210 mg, get the rest from food. Also use mindfulness breathing techniques and yin yoga short sequences or a yoga nidra guided meditation to quieten down the mind. Need to vary the routines though as otherwise get easily bored."
What do you take to go to sleep?,"That is WAY too much magnesium! No wonder you're light headed, your BP is probably low. Unless you have a deficiency, 250 before bed is fine. 350mg is the upper limit. I know because I was taking way too much and had facial flushing I thought was from perimenopause. After a couple days with no extra I felt fine. I suggest you drop the extra supplementation!"
What do you take to go to sleep?,"A morning workout is definitely a no go, our (little) sleep is way too precious to cut and we also have the ability to fall asleep anytime during the day except from when we are supposed to 😂

Swimming is my fav too but the gym is a company gym that Im definitely not going to especially in a swimwear 😂

I have an online private trainer through the Trainiac app so I usually just do it in the afternoon, around 6 so I can have dinner take a shower and fall asleep 😂"
What do you take to go to sleep?,"funny enough after skipping the 500 for a few days I slept 10 hours, research I've done is conflicting but at least my little experiance so far too much can have the oppisite effect"

Clonidine Alone as Treatment?,It's usually sedating for the first week or two. After that it should be fine.
Clonidine Alone as Treatment?,I’ve been on clonidine for several years now but not for my adhd I’m on it for anxiety. It will definitely make you drowsy at first but after a while of consistently taking it the drowsiness goes away. It’s done nothing for my adhd even when I was on nothing but the clonidine. I only find it mildly helpful for my anxiety. Guanfacine is another med prescribed for adhd that I was on but the effects were very similar to Clonidine. 
Clonidine Alone as Treatment?,"Hey did you end up staying with it? I’m on day 1 of Clonidine and while I know it’s only day 1, I’m not noticing much except for drowsiness. Just looking around Reddit for some more experiences."
Clonidine Alone as Treatment?,"Sorry this is an old post, but I started clonidine alone for ADHD and woke up the very next day like a new freaking person. Or, more like my old self rather. I could remember things again and easily find things that I lost, and I actually stopped losing them altogether. I was able to easily write a huge paper for school in about 6 hours, which is how I used to be able to do it, but for the past year I’ve been struggling like hell. I blamed all these things on getting old or not getting enough sleep, I had no idea they were curable! I love this med."
Clonidine Alone as Treatment?,Good to hear that
Clonidine Alone as Treatment?,Ugh yeah not very hopeful for this one
Clonidine Alone as Treatment?,I couldn't start it due to low BP

Clonidine w/o fatigue?,"I took clonidine for a short stint. I wouldn’t say it made me tired but I did experience a calming effect which I suppose is the precursor to fatigue (mild version of the side effect). It got better with time as k adjusted. Your experience could be great with it— but you have to test the waters and see 

Have you looked into guanfacine? I hear it’s a bit less sedating. Just an option"
Clonidine w/o fatigue?,"Yes I’ve looked at that aswell! From what I’ve read it’s very tiring aswell for sure, but Clonidine is so bad it’s also used for sleep disorders lol. Can I ask what made you stop taking clonidine when you were on it?"
Clonidine w/o fatigue?,We were using it as last ditch effort for what I thought was anxiety. We discovered later I had ADHD and started Adderall which took care of all my restlessness and what I called “anxiety”. So there was no need for it anymore.
Clonidine w/o fatigue?,You would think you’d have some betterment on the adhd with clonidine but I am glad Adderall worked for ya mate!

This is not an unreasonable combo, and you shouldn’t need to reintroduce anything, you should just be able to start it."

"Guanfacine or clonidine to help ADHD and hypertension, what are your experiences? Did it help your ADHD?","clonidine is good for restlessness, motor tics, impulsivity, anxiety, sleep, etc. it generally requires q8h dosing if taking it for BP or you need 24h coverage. it can also be taken PRN for stimulant induced insomnia.vmain side effects are drowsiness, dry mouth, mild depression but will disappear with time. if you start taking it regularly >7 days and decide to stop, you will have to reduce your dose gradually (0.25mcg every few days) to avoid rebound hypertension. this may require stopping or reducing your stimulant for a few days until BP is stabilised. if these aren't deal breakers for you, go for it.

Clonidine and dexamfetamine changed my life - feeling like ADHD is completely cured.,That’s great! I’m on Dex and gabapentin. Thinking of swapping the gaba out for clonidine. Were you on the Dex for a while before starting the clonidine then all those things got better for you? What’s your dosing schedule like? I was on clonidine in the past but I don’t think I had it dialed in right so I stopped it.
Clonidine and dexamfetamine changed my life - feeling like ADHD is completely cured.,I’m on Clonidine only. It seemed to work at first but after a few weeks I’m back to normal. I have a history of substance abuse so I’d like to avoid adderall but maybe I need to give it another shot?
Clonidine and dexamfetamine changed my life - feeling like ADHD is completely cured.,"I’ve never heard of clonidine. I’ve been on Dexedrine for 2 years but lately the come down leaves me tired and irritable and it only lasts for about 2 hours. I also take lexapro for anxiety. Anything in the adderall family gives me panic attacks. 

My heart rate also sky rockets on Dexedrine which makes my already high heart rate hover at 100bpm to 110bpm. 

I have inattentive type with some hyperactivity. How does clonidine help specifically with symptoms?"
Clonidine and dexamfetamine changed my life - feeling like ADHD is completely cured.,"Posts like yours are the reason I never stop searching for guanfacine and clonidine experiences on this sub! 😂 Dex gives me the focus but I still have the racing thoughts, restlessness/hyperactivity. Guanfacine is next for me!"
Clonidine and dexamfetamine changed my life - feeling like ADHD is completely cured.,"Please be aware that RSD, or rejection sensitivity dysphoria, is not a syndrome or disorder recognised by any medical authority. 

Rejection sensitivity dysphoria has not been the subject of any credible peer-reviewed scientific research, nor is it listed in the top two psychiatric diagnostic manuals, the DSM or the ICD. It has been propagated solely through blogs and the internet by William Dodson, who coined the term in the context of ADHD. Dodson's explanation of these experiences and claims about how to treat it all warrant healthy skepticism.

Here are some scientific articles on ADHD and rejection:

* [Rejection sensitivity and disruption of attention by social threat cues](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2771869/)
* [Justice and rejection sensitivity in children and adolescents with ADHD symptoms](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24878677/)
* [Rejection sensitivity and social outcomes of young adult men with ADHD](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17242422/)

Although r/ADHD's rules strictly disallow discussion of other 'popular science' (aka unproven hypotheses), we find that many, many people identify with the concept of RSD, and we have **not** removed this post. We do not want to minimise or downplay your feelings, and many people use RSD as a shorthand for this shared experience of struggling with emotions. 

However, please consider using the terms 'rejection sensitivity' and 'emotional dysregulation' instead.

Clonidine and dexamfetamine changed my life - feeling like ADHD is completely cured.,"Yes I have dex since 3 years.

dex helps me think and concentrate and gives me (inner-)drive. Clonidine eliminates all other problems. I take dex as needed and clonidine 3 times a day. It is 0.075 mg per dose."
Clonidine and dexamfetamine changed my life - feeling like ADHD is completely cured.,I have this since two weeks and the only thing that changes is no sleepiness anymore. But all other effects still there.
Clonidine and dexamfetamine changed my life - feeling like ADHD is completely cured.,"if you’re scared about things. I’d look into the lisdexamfetamine side of things. So vyvanse along with the new generics. These meds are very hard to abuse because they don’t have what I like to call a “re-stack” affect like other stimulants out there. As your body has to actually break down the medication to form two parts. The “lis” part  (enzyme L-lysine. Harmless and normal) and dextroamphetamine (the stimulant part to combat Adhd symptoms). This process cannot be sped up, hence why the “re-stack/abuse part” could (possibly) be reduced a lot. 


I was looking into stimulants a lot. I knew I would abuse the stuff. So i decided to look into meds I wouldn’t abuse like long/all day stimulants. 


Another thing that may help is to always ask yourself why you want to take more meds. Is it just for the dopamine? Probably. If so, are you going to become more productive? Probably/Definitely fucking not. Chances are your just looking around for get more dopamine out of a certain activity like a video game or something. 


You’ll be okay friend. If it helps, keep something to keep you accountable. I had to stop doing half doses of my vyvanse cause i’d attempt to restack during the day. It might help some. I was just abusing it. Now it’s once a day only. Especially recognizing that if i wanted to reup I couldn’t half it, only one full pill. Something of which i’d feel when some exam would come up but I don’t have the meds to study for it.


Sorry for the long post with shitty spacing, grammar, spelling, and punctuation. My Vyvanse has kicked in and I have a chem exam to study for because I was a couple days short cause I was half dose re-upping. The exam is tomorrow. I’m also on my phone. I just wanted to shed some light."

Clonidine and dexamfetamine changed my life - feeling like ADHD is completely cured.,UPDATE: I was switched to clonidine and it made me rage so bad. I wanted to smash things and hurt people. I immediately got off of it. I’m also off lexapro after megadosing magnesium which has cured FM anxiety.

Clonidine and dexamfetamine changed my life - feeling like ADHD is completely cured.,". But the sleep quality isn't that good tbh. Its not as bad as antihistamines but deffo not good. Whereas actual sleep drugs such as mirtazapine or agomelatine . the later one actually improving sleep quality and mirta for onset rather though esp in the start of treatment also gives some sleep quality improvements . clonidine is a pretty ""hard"" drug as in it has various side effects and similar to unselective betablockers does have some upright unhealthy effects.  
I'd personally use a more selective betablocker one like bisoprolol (lasts longer) or metroprolol for bp control and mirtazapine/agomelatine/trazodone for sleep. As that's significantly easier on your body.  
Extra note:  
If you want to reduce stimulant action if its an amphetamine high dose vit C to lower blood pH does significantly aid premature excretion. And is even done in medical settings to combat strong stimulant overdoses"

Anyone here tried Clonidine (Catapres)?,"I also take it with my stimulant medication( Adderall ). I don't know what it actually does, but it works in conjunction with the Adderall. I know it helps with my anxiety and regulating the stimulant. You can Google it. There are tons of studies on it. That being said, I'm not a doctor and I'm not trying to give you a medical advice at all. However, it sounds to me like you need to get your elevance or Vyvanse adjusted. You probably need to go up again. It's completely normal for you to play with the dose to get that proper benefits from your medication. I myself had to have my meds adjusted three or four times. Just don't go up too high to where you get to the point of being uncomfortable. Also, 20 mg of Vyvanse from everything that I have seen and read, is a pretty low dose so you probably do need to increase it."

Question about Clonidine and Guanfacine,"They have the potential to contribute to fatigue, but nobody’s going to be able to predict how you’ll tolerate them. I don’t know about anhedonia, but wouldn’t be surprised if you could basically say the same thing. I am not a medical professional.  
  
I take Guanfacine ER 3mg. Early on I asked my doctor if I could take it in the morning instead of before bed, because I’m awful at consistently taking meds before bed. I was told to go for it, so long as it doesn’t make me too drowsy/fatigued. It doesn’t make me too drowsy/fatigued unless I didn’t get enough sleep the night before, in which case I end up getting more of the sleep I need. Works for me. Your experience may be different."

Question about Clonidine and Guanfacine,"Hey, I have no idea if his question is still relevant but: I've been taking clonidine for 4 weeks because of pots and adrenaline dumps.

Today I started taking guanfacine and so far I haven't noticed any tiredness, probably because I'm already used to clonidine and its similar effects?"

Vyvanse/Clonidine Delay?,"Getting good sleep is VERY important when taking stimulants and can make you feel drowsy and crash if you aren’t getting enough sleep. Do you have a consistent sleep schedule? Are you also getting enough protein with your meals? That always determines how tired I’m going to feel and make it a point to make sure my breakfast and lunch are nutritious and filling. Also remembering to stay hydrated as that can also lead to fatigue.

I take vyvanse everyday and what you’re experiencing could be related to your period, but from personal experience, those lethargic days were almost always cuz I was running on low sleep or fatigued from not eating and felt exhausted. Try to keep a consistent schedule and if the symptoms continue after your period, you might wanna talk to your doctor because they may need to lower your dosage."
Vyvanse/Clonidine Delay?,"Thank you for all this. I definitely have been trying to get good sleep, but it really depends on how busy I am. Also protein is a big thing in my house. I normally have a protein shake with breakfast but this morning I didn’t, so that could be why as well. The Vyvanse has been killing my appetite so it’s been harder to eat the things I need to because it feels more like a chore than something enjoyable at times. It depends on the day as well though. 
I sing for my job so hydration is also super important to me, the dry mouth has also been a big seller on drinking more water lol. 
Thank you so much for all of this info. I think I should start putting my foot down more in late night plans when I have an early morning. Also sticking to a fairly strict schedule on when I take my meds/eat breakfast will be more helpful as well. I’m a teacher, so summer time is hard for me to stay consistent :) 
Thank you again!!!"

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,This is probably not the best advice but I just wait until I’m absolutely exhausted before I go to bed and then I sleep within a few minutes. If I go to bed before that I just lay awake worrying about the fact that I can’t sleep

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"When i was younger I'd get frustrated and then angry that i couldn't sleep. Now I give up 2hrs of my day, every day, to lay in bed in the dark and just chill on my phone. 

I still can't sleep normally but at least I'm not frustrated every night (just some nights)

Edit - I share your frustration with wanting to recover. I have chronic back pain and it's definitely worse after a poor sleep"

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,I usually tire myself out until I can barely physically move whenever I get my brain to switch off for the night
How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,I watch YouTube videos. Long form game play usely works for me. As long as it's not a horror game I'll fall asleep with in 15 mins
How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"I have had insomnia since i was a teenager, i'm now on a medication to help me sleep but it really didn't work well until i got into somewhat of a ritual. I have very specific ways to sleep and i *have* to follow it every night or i won't sleep.
1. Do not lay in bed unless you're going to sleep or have sex. Even if you aren't feeling well, move to the couch.
2. No TV in the bedroom. I understand that doesn't work for everybody, but my bedroom is not for that sort of entertainment.
3. Try not to be on your phone in bed. Blue light from technology can make it harder to sleep.
4. Find your perfect room temperature and textiles. I prefer my room to be on the cooler side. My sheets are bamboo to help keep me from overheating but i have a nice thick comforter to keep me cozy.
5. I have bad tinnitus so i sleep with background noise. I have a fan or my air conditioner going, as well as a sound device that plays thunderstorm sounds.
6. Blackout curtains. Literally life changing.
7. Phones these days (at least the iphone for sure) have an option for a sleep schedule with ""wind down"" time. To keep it simple, you set the time you want to go to bed and it automatically puts your phone on DND a certain amount of time before you should sleep. Mine gives me an hour warning so i can start getting ready for bed.
8. Try and sleep at the same time every night, which is easier said than done. I naturally fall asleep later on the weekends but i try to keep the timing the same, and then obviously early sleep times when i need to work the next day.
9. If you're in bed for a while and can't fall asleep, get up. Move around for a bit or try sitting somewhere else for a bit. This one can be frustrating when you're exhausted and you just want to fall asleep, but your body needs to recognize you're only in bed to do so and you won't stay there unless it's for sleeping.

You almost need to train your body to recognize it's time to sleep. I had many, many years where I could not fall asleep or i would after a few hours, and then i'd be wide awake with barely any sleep. The longest i went was maybe 4-6 hours in just over a week and i ended up in the hospital. You gotta have a wind down ritual too, so whatever skin care or prep for the next day that you can do every night.

Hope i'm not coming off preachy and that this helps!!"
How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"So you need to find something that interests your brain more than it's own thoughts but not so much that it would rather be listening to it than sleeping, this can be hard to find, it can be music, podcasts, documentaries, movies, or something else, build extra time into your sleep schedule for falling sleep that is more than you actually need to fall asleep because before I'd set my alarm for 8 hours and 15 minutes after I went to bed but then I'd be stressed about falling asleep within 15 minutes, so instead I set an alarm for 8 hours and 45 minutes after I go to bed, which helps me be less stressed about having to fall asleep quickly, that's what's worked for me but everyone is diffrent, good luck"
How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"Melatonin and music. The genre of music doesn't matter so much as just giving my brain something to focus on that isn't my thoughts. I can fall asleep to metal and screaming just as well as gentle, calm music, lol."
How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"I’m a quick sleeper naturally so I don’t have too much to add tips-wise, but I will say: the conditions that lead to me sleeping or not can be varied.  So maybe try switching some things up and see?

In my case, as a stomach sleeper, I can hop in bed and be out in a couple minutes.  But if there was a TV on? Hours.  Hate TV when I’m trying to sleep.  However, if I’m on my back to sleep and no TV is on? Would take me hours to fall asleep.  On my back and the TV is on? Minutes.  Really odd."
How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"I listen to podcasts, which gives me something to focus on and stops my racing thoughts. I'm pretty sure that every sleep expert in the world would say that this was a terrible idea, but it works for me."
How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"I read in bed and then wee immediately before I want to go to sleep (otherwise I'll sit and think whether I need to wee or not for ages) and then listen to podcasts that are not boring but not interesting, or sleep meditation specific ones. It takes the edge off my brain enough to switch off"
How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,Drink two glasses of wine and masturbate.
How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"I used to turn on a movie or TV show I've seen many times before with a sleep timer. Now I listen to an audiobook with a sleep timer. If I don't have something to listen to my mind races, but with a book I'm usually asleep within minutes. The timer is 10 mins and I can't remember the last time I had to start it again while going to sleep."
How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"Proper sleep hygiene. Working on establishing proper morning and evening routines. Everybody knows the stuff that is being recommended to sleep better. Like no electronics, hydration, only in bed for sleeping, etc. It avoided doing that for years, but my sleep has improved so much since I am more strict in that."
How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"My therapist told me about the hypo arousal and hyper arousal that our brain experiences (similar to children with ptsd) so he told me no gaming, no phone, no bright lights an hour before bed. It helps a lot"
How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,Counting my breaths used to work for me. Basically I’d count to 10 and start over. Now that my insomnia has gotten worse it doesn’t work anymore. The app Breethe has some cool sleep hypnosis.

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"I try to get into bed around the same time each night. Then I read or watch something until I feel tired enough to sleep. If I’m already tired when I get into bed, I put on an audiobook with a sleep timer. It has to be a book that I like the readers voice and I’m not super interested in. 

I also try to switch the goal from falling asleep to getting rest. This helps with the frustration of not being able to fall asleep and even if I’m not sleeping, resting is still beneficial. I find when I get annoyed or frustrated about not sleeping it actually makes it harder to sleep. I use the affirmation “any rest is good rest” and if I’m feeling too wiggly I’ll try stretching in bed or doing some gentle twists or putting lotion on my body in a soothing way."
How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"I found that nature sounds really helped me fall asleep, especially when there is sounds of water. I especially love the sound of thunderstorms and heavy rain. I set it to play for an hour and that has helped tremendously to fall asleep."
How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"I have to bribe myself to go to bed. Bedtime is 10:30 pm, but I get to watch youtube for a while.  Then when I get drowsy (around midnight/1am) I put on a good and familiar audiobook and listen till I fall asleep.

Also, I take a milligram of melatonin an hour before bedtime."
How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"Since I was a little kid, the best method would be to act/roleplay in bed. I’d pretend either I’m in or that I’m one of my characters in a show/movie/game/etc. I let myself move in reaction to scenes and stuff, I even let my eyes open, and I fall asleep decently quickly without realizing it. That, along with lofi radios/old jazz + rain/brown noise to help. There’s a few very specific videos I use and now I’ve associated them with sleep so my brain is like oop! That’s the sleepy sounds."
How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,Counting results in me giving up or losing my place and meditation is just frustration because of racing thought. I take melatonin and magnesium before bed and leave a podcast or tiktok playing as I drift to sleep. If I wasn’t doing that I would be forced to miss my bedtime and stay up hours after my bedtime until I tire myself out.
How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"Guided bedtime stories or yoga nidra meditations help me a lot, it gives my brain something to focus on while I drift off. Also, brain dumping in the journal before bed/planning my next day, setting out clothes, etc. preparing for the next day seems to put my mind at ease before sleep instead of just jumping into bed raw dogging it, if you will 😂"
How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"I use guided meditation and sleep stories for adults, like ""Nothing Much Happens"" on Spotify. I'm usually asleep within 10min. I find that they quieten my inner monologue."
How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"I'm surprised no one on this thread brought up binaural beats. 

Put in a comfortable set of earbuds, and search YouTube or an app for binaural beats delta.

If you listen to binaural beats at 1.5 hz frequency, it can entrain your brain toward the delta range of brain waves. This is the state your brain is in during deep sleep. Give it a try. It works for me."

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,Melatonin
How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"Melatonin, listen to a t.v. show I've seen a billion times, and I play picross on the switch. It's a puzzle game, which is slow and makes me think. Eventually the Melatonin kicks on and my brain goes, 'fuck, this puzzle is boring and I fall asleep. 

I only realized this games does that for me on accident. When I'd be watching a show on the couch while playing the game and doze off."
How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"I've only been medicated for a couple months with stimulants, and sleep comes so much more easily because, I think, I'm not agitated and anxious and thinking a ton of thoughts because I actually got things done. Sleep comes more easily. 

Before that, though, I had horrible trouble falling asleep. I don't like sleeping pills because of morning fog atop ADHD fog. 

My doc put me on a relatively-quite-low dose of trazodone at bedtime. It's not a narcotic, and the drug is actually an antidepressant at the standard dosages. It's very effective for me and gets me there in well under an hour. It doesn't knock me out if something comes up, just somehow quiets the mind enough to facilitate sleep! No side effects. (I remembered when my doctor prescribed it that is known people who were provided a liquid form of trazodone to help them sleep in substance-abuse detox and inpatient treatment. So it seems the effects of this stuff in this manner are well-known. 

Melatonin: never found that helps me fall asleep, but an hour or two before bed and I could swear it helped me stay asleep through the night before I started getting the sleep after stimulant meds that basically seems to be an untroubled mind that's ready to reset. My doc and other research have looked me to believe 5mg is really about where that dose should be. (Some concern you're making melatonin and if you get a connection on the outside for it, maybe you won't produce it efficiently? Anyway little worry at the 5mg level.)

Breathing for sleep: While I'm not a regular practitioner of meditation (for no good reason because it's great), I'm a big believer in focusing on the breath when overwhelmed or stressed, anxious or unsettled. I do the 4 - 7 - 8 breathing technique of my mind is racing when I turn it the light. Right there on the pillow. I don't know that I've ever gotten to a fourth repetition it's so effective. I also use it if I'm freaking out while awake to calm myself down and hopefully think more clearly. I'm sharing a link that explains it, but it seems in my mind from prior explanations that bringing your focus to counting breaths and holding breaths and breathing, feeling the air come into your nose and fill your lungs to expand your belly, then going out again, when you do it just a few times, takes your brain away from the other chaos and then the rhythm and the oxygen levels calm your pulse, and your body sorta tricks your mind into ""everything's calm here, let's rest."" Here's the technique from a source I don't recognize, but the information is consistent with what I've seen before from reputable sources: https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324417#what-is-it

Also, podcasts. I usually set a podcast to play on a sleep timer and put it at a low volume. Especially if I've done the breathing and or taken the trazodone, my main focus on a quiet voice or two becomes drowsily missing pieces of the story, then becomes ... morning. I listened to the entire archive of the public radio OG ""podcast"" This American Life when I moved to Times Square. Quiet, smart voices telling interesting stories about a variety of topics. Also have used a podcast called Nothing Much Happens that's a sorta ASMR whispering voice telling stories with lots of details and minimal plot. I've also used guided meditation for sleep with the Calm app. (i'd use that app all the time if I could afford it)

I hope some of this is helpful."
How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"I’ve learned to focus and meditate. It sucks but you just gotta breathe and focus. I try and picture the first peaceful scene I can think of, usually a forest and a waterfall with mist and a rainbow above it. It was just the first thing my brain thought up.

It's literally just a guy trying to bore you to sleep. There have been a few I actually was interested in listening to but I still fall asleep.

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,I do a few things for my bedtime it helps for me personally might help you. I first have a reminder for bed about 30 mins before half the time I ignore it but if I don’t I go upstairs and do a set nightly routine (brush teeth etc). afterwards when I get back to my room I have a smart light that simulates a sunset ( does sunrise as well also important) that usually starts getting me tired. Lastly make sure room is pitch black and lay on my back and try to sleep(usually have a song or video on as well) I also make sure to have phone and electronic brightness set to the lowest along with I’ve completely cut out alcohol and caffeine from my life! This whole routine makes it so I’m always sleepy by a certain time and it gets my mind ready for sleep and it’s mostly gotten rid of the nights of tossing and turning

One thing is certain though, and that is that I can either wake up a few minutes after I've fallen asleep and/or numerous times during the night and it will take me forever to fall asleep again due to a racing mind.

Either way, 90 out of 100 nights of sleep I'm waking up exhausted with the feeling that I haven't slept at all.

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"I use the podcast ""Sleep With Me"" I'm usually asleep before the episode is even half over. (Less than 30 min usually)

My brain is constantly ""on"" and feels like my brain will never let me sleep, but if I have the podcast on, it kinda tunes my brain out when I'm otherwise focused. I frequently find my brain wandering away from the podcast, but instead of paying any attention to my thoughts, I just tune back into the podcast. Even if I wake up in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep, I turn it on and it puts me out.

There are lots of podcasts that do similarly and ""Sleep With Me"" has lots of links to other ones.

I will note though, it probably took a week+ of using the podcast for it to really ""work"""

If i really cant get settled a cool-ish shower helps. There’s something about getting into bed a little cool and warming up. I believe the cool shower also helps calm your body and mind down. Something I learnt in the Psych ward.
How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"Audiobooks on a one hour timer - I rarely have to extend it, and then I'll rewind the following night to a scene I last remember hearing. Typically, books I've already listened to/read, and it can't be at a very exciting point! (Last night, it was coming up to the climax of the book and I had to reset the sleep timer twice as so much was going on. In the end, I gave up and put on Harry Potter as I've heard it so many times. I was fast asleep in probably 10 minutes).

I cannot sleep without an audiobook as my brain will literally not stop thinking. Been like this my whole life, but until being diagnosed I didn't realise it was ADHD related as I was only diagnosed at 30!"

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"I put brown noise on. Headspace has a number of different ones I like: red noise, brown noise, howling wind sounds, laundromat, car drive, snowfall, desert drive, etc. (Nothing with water - it's good for relaxing but not sleeping.) Even campfire or indoor fire sometimes.

I always manage to fall asleep to them unless I'm thinking about something really hard. I think seeing the intention that this WANT to sleep is key for this to work, so you want to practice noting (noting when you're distracted, then go back to the meditative state).

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"There are a lot of responses but to anyone who sees this comment, my recommendation is listening to deep, super low frequency sleep music. 

There are a few on YouTube that I listen to, which I will link below (no they are not my channels/I am completely unaffiliated, just linking the ones I like.) A few of the videos have titles like “put you to sleep in 5 minutes” which sounds gimmicky until you realize it actually did. I put them on my tv (a lot of them go to “black screen”) and it always puts me to sleep. You might have to try a few different ones to get the one that you like the best. Some of them have like “melodies” which I find don’t work for me. 

Melatonin works also.

Another one for when your brain just won't quit and the zippy thoughts are keeping you awake, at least in my experience, is to have yourself a coffee.

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"Some of my methods:

1. I vape Indica.  A few hits of my vape and I am relaxed then suddenly so sleepy I can’t keep my eyes open.  It is good sleep, too.
2. I try to listen to audio books, specifically any Terry Pratchett book narrated by Nigel Planer.  There is something so soothing about it that even though I am totally into the story, I can’t stay awake longer than ten or so minutes.
3. Podcasts.  Similarly to audio books, there are a few podcasts where I find the person speaking so soothing.  It is like listening to a friend speak.  I feel safe and comforted.  My three are Sarah Turney from Voices for Justice, Sadie Carpenter from Leaving Eden, and Robert Evans from Behind the Bastards.
4. Music.  This used to be my go-to as a teen and in my dorm in college.  I would wear headphones and zone out.  Since I have shared a bed with a partner, I haven’t done this…mostly because I don’t want to accidentally start singing along! ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
5. I play word puzzle games on my phone.  Any other type of game doesn’t work because I will want to keep playing it.  But figuring out specific words from a group of random letters is what tires out the part of my brain that has trouble turning off.

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"Insomnia starts when you're taking longer than usual to fall asleep, and you start to worry about not getting enough sleep. At this point, the anxiety is actually keeping you awake. The more anxious you get, the less you sleep, the more anxious you get, the less you sleep. 

Feeling tired during the day is a bit shit, but it won't kill you and it will make sleep come more easily the following evening, so you don't actually have anything to worry about. Your body knows what to do. If you adopt some good sleep hygiene habits, the problem will most likely sort itself out. It's not easy, because night time is the most enjoyable time to be awake (at least in my opinion) but if you have the discipline to follow the rules you can probably fix this in a few weeks.

1. Wake up at the same time every single day. Never sleep in, ever. If you have a consistent wake-up time, your body will get used to the routine and waking up will start to feel easier. If you sleep in on weekends (for example) it will be harder to get to sleep the following night, and your whole circadian rhythm will shift backwards, so you have to spend the following week trying to catch up. It's not worth it. A consistent wake-up time will stabilise your circadian rhythm, and then your bedtime routine will fall in line.

2. Don't stay in bed if you're not sleeping. Give it 10 to 15 minutes, and if you don't fall asleep, get up, go to another room, and read a book (or do something else quiet and relaxing - no screens). Go back to bed when you feel sleepy. Rince and repeat until you fall asleep. Also, don't stay in bed during the day. If you do daytime things in bed, your body will be conditioned to be alert in your bedroom environment, which is not what you want. Bed is only for sleeping (and sex, if you're lucky).

3. Get a big dose of daylight as soon as you wake up, to help shift your circadian rhythm forwards, and avoid light at night (particularly blue light) as this can shift your circadian rhythm backwards. There is some debate as to how much this actually matters, but it costs you nothing to be mindful of the effect blue light can have on your sleep cycle.

4. Melatonin supplements may help put you to sleep, but it never worked for me. 

5. Take a hot bath/shower before bed. When you get out, your core body temperature drops a little, and your brain takes this as a signal that it's time to sleep. 

6. Be aware of the stimulants you're consuming, and how your body responds. Also food and alcohol.

7. Exercise in the mornings. 

8. Make sure the bedroom is dark, and quiet, and the right temperature.

9. Get rid of any electronics that have the potential to grab your attention. This includes any visible clocks, at least until you're sleeping better. You don't need to know what time it is. It's sleep'O'clock; that's all you need to know! 

10. If you tried all of this, consistently, for a few weeks, and it isn't working, consider going to see a sleep specialist. 

Good luck."
How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"Have a routine/ritual before, shower before bed (it changes your body temp in a way that helps you sleep), get rid of light (seriously, if you watch something while you fall asleep, consider turning the screen away from you or wear eye coverings), and for me personally my version of counting sheep has always been either mentally tracing the path to a familiar distant place like a common family vacation spot, or mentallly constructing castles but I'm just a weirdo so 🤷‍♂️"

2. Avoid caffeine after a certain hour. This will be different for everyone. I'm good if I stop drinking it by 8 pm or so but some people have to stop mid-afternoon.
3. Avoid electronics for the last couple of hours before bed. Watching TV is fine, but avoid spending significant time on a phone or tablet. (E-ink screens are fine though. They're very eye-friendly.)
4. Deal with stress and anxiety. Mindfulness is very helpful in this regard. Staying on top of things as best you can is helpful too."

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"TLDR at bottom.


Go to bed an hour earlier. My ADHD therapist told me one piece of advice that has been so hugely helpful. ""You have time blinders. You will never remember all the little things before a task so plan for it. Assume any major task needs one hour of lead up time.

So for example if on Saturday I need to grocery shop, mow the law, visit my friend for coffee, and go to the gym, my schedule should look like this

8-Getup
9-Gym
10-prep time
11-Groceries
12-prep time
1-coffee
2-prep time
3-mow the lawn
4-prep time
5-dinner & shower


Once you do it for a bit you get a better feel for it. But before I'd put say groceries and gym side by side, because i could go out and do both in the car. Well chatting with people at gym, staring vacantly at my phone in the parking lot, and forgetting grocery bags all have lead up time

So give yourself an extra hour of sleep. If you aim for 8 you're going to probably get 7 or 6. So aim for 9. I don't mean because it will take you an hour tossing and turning (that hour actually counts as sleep). I say in bed for 9 hours because of time blindness you need transition and safety time built in. 

Another big one for somw people is ADHD meds can cause insomnia. Check with your doctor and think about switching it might help.

Finally I know y'all hate to hear it, but it's the same advice you've always been told. Establish a good routine and never break it. No phones 1 hour before bed. Bed same time, up same time each day. Go to the gym. ect. Think of each good sleep hygiene thing you do as 1 point and each routine you lock in will make it easier to get good sleep.It takes takes an average person 2 months to form a habit, takes an ADHDer twice as long. but once you do it will pay dividends for years. 


I've worked on all this stuff for the past decade. Until very recently I tossed and turned for hours each night. As a 19 year old my mom still had to get me up to go to school. At 31 I actually fall asleep at a decent time, and feel rested during the day. It makes all your ADHD symptoms so much better.


TLDR: Slowly build up a good routine. Work at 1 thing at a time. Give yourself an extra hour to be safe. Changing meds can sometimes help."

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"Once I'm in bed, under the blankets with the light off, I fall asleep in less than 5 minutes basically every single time. 

This didn't used to be the case. I used to lay in bed for an hour plus trying to sleep almost every night, but after adjusting my sleep habits that changed rapidly. 

Part of the reason many people have trouble sleeping (as a health and wellness coach with much continuing education in sleep), is their bed habits and sleep schedule. 

When we're in our bedroom under the blankets, it should be strictly for sleep (or maybe sex but even this I do on top of the blankets now). But a lot of us do many things in our beds under the covers. Like watch TV, eat snacks, scroll our phone, play video games etc. When we do other things, our brains learn to associate bed with those other things instead of sleep. 

Once people are able to change what they do in their beds under the covers, their brains will learn to associate differently with it. 

So now, once I turn the lights off and get under the covers in a bed, my brain knows the ONLY thing I do in that situation is sleep. And often I literally fall asleep in less than 2 minutes (which isn't always good, as sometimes when we fall asleep *too* rapidly it can indicate severe exhaustion). But I have very regular sleep hours and I've built a very strong association with my brain and sleep when I'm under the covers. 

If you're just going to do other things in bed regardless they should be with at least some lights on and on top of the blankets. 

Also our sleep hours should be as regular as possible (what time we get in bed to sleep and wake up for the day), even on weekends. This helps regulate our bodies natural rhythm and processes and will improve sleep processes.

Our environment can also play a role in sleep and sleep quality, but unless its just overly hot/cold or bright every night, it's usually bed habits that keep people laying in bed forever not able to fall asleep.

Edit: also, supplementing melatonin can mess with our body's natural production over the long term and isn't a very good solution. It's more a cover up then a true fix"

When I start getting sleepy, I switch to watching asmr videos on YouTube until I can't keep my eyes open any more.

I do sometimes have problems staying asleep. I'll wake up in the night and my brain starts going and I can't fall back asleep. A technique I learned to deal with that is called ""put it in the box.""

Ive never really had an issue falling asleep. In fact, I’ve one a few bets against people that didn’t believe I could fall asleep in a certain situation. But I also don’t sleep a lot. Overheard someone say the above quote and it made me feel a lot better about how little I sleep.

In the event that I find myself laying in bed long before I want to actually sleep (on vacation or something) I just let my brain go loose. I basically fantasize on auto-pilot.

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"Hope this makes it to you buddy... 

I've struggled with this a lot in my life, and uncovered some cool hacks. First, honestly, is my phone. I charge it within arms reach but try to not look at it for an hour or so before bed. If you do, try using a blue light protector or blue light glasses or something. Same, but less so with the tv.

Next, when I notice myself unable to sleep, I immediately get on my back. Idk why but that's where I fall asleep best. I think maybe bc it's most relaxing?

Lastly, I close my eyes and focus on my breath. It's not a counting technique per se, but it's just trying to get you to zero in on something so the background noise in my head starts to subside. You can count them, but I find that gets me drifting again (work with numbers and associate them to stupid shit all the time). I find a simple 'in through your nose, out through your mouth' mantra works fine, or when I'm getting more tired 'in... out'.

Hope that helps homie! Wishing you the best, no/limited sleep is truly the worst."

Having a routine and sticking to it helps a lot, as does calming down your nervous system down before bed. Getting to a routine that works took me years to tweak but it works like a charm now.

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"Melatonin and strict sleep hygiene, mostly. I take my melatonin about an hour and a half before I will be going to bed, and I go to bed within the same 30 min range every weeknight. I have my phone set to automatically switch to Nightshift red wave lighting so I don’t have the blue light stimulating my brain, and I also have parental controls on my phone that lock me out of time suck apps at 9pm. Then when I do go to bed, I set a 15 min sleep timer and listen to my favorite book series religiously. I use my favorite series because it is enjoyable and comforting, but also it’s familiar so my brain doesn’t get hyperfixated on novelty. And probably most importantly, I don’t ever hang out in my bed/bedroom. The bed is only for sleep and sex. (Though I acknowledge this last one is a privilege of owning a home with my husband and not having roommates, I know some folks living arrangements don’t always make this tip practical.)

It's a work in progress, but definitely better than it used to be. I'm gonna try taking have the magnesium dose, and see if it helps me get more sleep. I've also trying to stop screen time before bedtime, not take it to bed like I currently do.

Using extra focus on this helps me keep other things out. If this doesn’t work. I’ll just start chanting “sleep sleep sleep sleep” in my head and try to keep any images out of my mind. I’ll usually fall asleep somewhere along the way.

Also, if my mind ends up wandering to something I don’t want to dream about, I end up opening my eyes to kind of reorient myself before settling back in. I’ve always had a hard time remembering dreams, and somehow I got it in my head that if I don’t tell myself to remember my dreams, I usually won’t (unless I have nightmares, usually).

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"Well, I currently do sleep therapy as I would lay in bed wide awake for up to five hours before falling asleep. Apparently you have to cut off all the hours you don’t sleep, and just go to bed at the time when you start feeling sleepy (not tired, but sleepy) and can actually fall asleep. This may however involve you going to bed very late, at a non traditional time (if you have a delayed sleeping pattern like me). For me, the difference is striking. I fall asleep within minutes compared to after hours before. I didn’t change anything else. The funny thing is, if I go to sleep before I’m sleepy I actually sleep later than when I just follow my night owl instincts 🙄.

I struggled my whole life with not being able to fall asleep or stay asleep. I finally started taking a low dose over the counter sleeping pill, and it works wonders. I used to feel bad about doing it, but I’ve been taking them almost nightly for 3 years, and haven’t developed a tolerance or dependence on them. I realized I have a really hard time regulating my own sleep, I just don’t really feel the “sleepiness” cues from my body like other people seem to - I need to be really freakin tired to notice and it get the hint to go to sleep, and sleeping pills help with that.

It has made a massive difference for me"
How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,Take my meds at a regular time. Then turn off all electronics and do something like read a book or workout for 15-20 minutes. Don’t drink caffeine before bed. Have a time where you start shutting down your tasks so to speak. Take your meds 12 hours before you want to sleep is very important.  I have an older dog who needs to get up to go out around 4-5 who started throwing me off but now I’m taking it as the universe saying I have that extra time so we try to go to bed around 10:30-11 and he and I both get our melatonin.

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"I always had sleeping problems, insomnia, diagnosed PTSD & anxiety & and not knowing ADHD.
For the most of my life I wished I could fall asleep and stay sleep for more than 4-5 hours :(

So, I had been on sleeping pills(PSTD nightmares) & melatonin (10~20mg) to help me fall sleep and stay asleep for avg. 8:30 
quality sleep (my mattress tracks my vital and sleep Q - I know, I saved for it, it’s fancy 🙄 but getting a good sleep has changed my life (back issue, hot sleeper, waking up tired and grumpy GONE) but you don’t need those)

NOW, that I’m diagnosed with ADHD (to add it to my mental disorder list 😂) and started taking meds (Adderall), my brain is SO much more clear that:
- I’m having very relax & calm daytime; no more 24/7 anger, agitation, million of thoughts at night, etc
- I manage to go to bed on a schedule (I have been doing it for some time but got more organized after meds!!)
- I can finally do meditation (just breathing nothing special on YouTube )
- STOPPED taking melatonin! (I was very nervous for stopping it)

Tips:

- I love a rainforest plays before bed and stops 30 min! This made me stop using phone before bed(or some light podcasts again on timer) 
- I shut every single window, lights
- try to have lowest amount of noise or sound in the room (I tried sleeping with ear plugs for years-didn’t help at all)
- make sure your bed feels cool (at least to touch) & the room temp is as close as 65F
- if you feel your body feels warm or hot on the mattress, make sure you have Tencel (breathable fiber to exchange air) mattress protector (don’t buy trash from target, Costco, Amazon)
- make sure you have the best mattress you can afford for your sleeping position (side, back or stomach sleeper- it’s also a sign of sleeping hot!)

I’m a trained mattress expert and have witnessed how a mattress/pillow/ the room makes ppl sleep so their life SO different.

On the side, Go to BRANDs store (not a corner mattress store) ask them for a comfort test base on how you sleep. You don’t need to buy."
How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,I did CBT for insomnia a while back. Number one most important thing is stay out of your bed for anything other than sleep or sex. I know it’s hard but you will get way better sleep this way. Make your couch or some area like that a comfortable space where you can lounge around so that you don’t have to do it in your bed. Your brain will start to associate your bed with sleep and you’ll go to sleep faster and stay asleep longer.

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"I use box breathing but exhale to a count of 6 then rest to a count of 2, equaling 8. I do this because when I exhale I also do progressive muscle relaxation and in traditional box breathing I feel like I have to exhale really fast to do it in 4 seconds and that can turn into hyperventilating trying to stay within the amount of seconds, plus not enough time for PMR. (yes I am autistic.)
So while I inhale, I count to 4. While I hold it, I count to 4. While I exhale and then rest i slowly release the tension in my muscles, and I count to 8. Then start again. While I am exhaling, I do progressive muscle relaxation (PMR)
Inhale...2...3...4
Rest...2...3...4
Exhale (and do PMR)...2..3..4..5...hold...7...8
Repeat 

You'll fall asleep in 20 mins as soon as you get the rhythm down and stop counting in your head. 

It is REALLY CHALLENGING to get into the rhythm when you first start if you've had a tension filled day or are otherwise escalated emotionally. You HAVE to push through the feelings of wanting to breath faster and tense your muscles...those are *awake* feelings.... measured breathing and relaxed muscles are *asleep* feelings so you just have to push through the beginning to get yourself into the rhythm. 

Hope this helps!

P.s. if doing stuff like this at bedtime does not help, you'll need to start doing stuff during your waking hours that contributes to a good night sleep, such as 30 minutes of cardio, regular day time meditation, or even therapy and medication. I used to stay awake for days before I got put on medication, and I'm not even bipolar or anything, just insomniac. I take the lowest dose of seroquel at night and it makes me sleep almost like a normal person, but the above method is how I fall asleep instead or staying awake thinking."

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"There are a couple of things that help me. 

1) Winding down before bed; a couple of hours before i intent to sleep i close my curtains and put on very dim diffuse light and listen some relaxing music. I use this time to put on my pyjamas,  brush my teeth, plan/prepare the next day and do some cleaning etc... When im done i watch a chill yt video or podcast in bed. 

2) I remind myself of this routine with several labeld alarms in my phone. One 5 min before it starts, one when it starts and one when it ends and i try to sleep. 

3) I try to get some exercise and light through out the day.

4) Not going to bed when im unregulated/ anxious/ hungry etc. If im not in a good mental state then i cant sleep and i will end up feeling worse. I try to take care of that before i start my bed time routine. 

5) Not starting a task or activity that i could end up hyper focusing on. That way i will end up loosing track of time and or delaying my routine. It could also keep me awake because ill keep thinking about it in bed. 

6) Keeping melatonin around just in case. I also have an alarm for that. 

7) Comforting sensory stuff like a hot cup of tea comfy clothes etc. 

8) Listing things in my head after the Alphabet stops racing thoughts for me;

A- Apple
B- Banana 
C- Cucumber 
D- ...

Im not saying this will 100% help you. I find routines very helpful but they are also really hard to keep up especially because my ADHD tends to get worse in the evenings. To combat this i try to keep my routine more loose and try to keep in mind ""What is worth doing is worth doing poorly"". I stick with my theme of ""winding down"" but  i adjust it to my needs and energy of that peticular day."

Also, audiobooks. Laying in bed waiting to fall asleep is no longer unpleasant or stressful if my brain has something to keep it occupied.

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"I don’t know the nature of your insomnia but I have cured mine on my own without medicine. Maybe this will help you. I know I’ve helped many people by telling them my method and it’s worked for them as well.    


The reason I was an insomniac is because, like you, my mind would not shut down enough to fall asleep. The thoughts weren’t necessarily negative, just incessant. Whether it be thinking about things I had to do, or something funny that happened two years ago or why birds have such funny mating habits… my brain would just think. For hours. Until the stress over not sleeping set in.     


A lot of insomnia is the result of having a bad bought of not sleeping (a few days or a week or so) and then the panic that ensues takes over so that the reason for not sleeping is simply because you go into sleeping afraid your won’t sleep.     


Anyway, let me tell you my method and maybe it might help you. I’ve been doing it for 6 years now and haven’t needed medication anymore.   


You’ll need a paper white Kindle, The other thing is a relatively new product and has made it so much better, but it’s an external page turner. One piece clips on the kindle and the other piece is a small button you keep in your hand so you can turn the page just by pressing the button in your hand.     


If you’re thinking you’re not a reader, try and not worry about that. A lot of people who don’t like to read is because they haven’t found what they like or styles they like. Anyway, back to the method.    


Turn the lights out, lie down and get comfortable, and hold the kindle or prop it up with some pillows (get a clip/stand that makes it easier to do so). Turn the light setting on the lowest setting there is but make the font a bit larger until you can read the words comfortably. Since you have the button to turn the page, it’s not as annoying as having to touch the screen every few moments to turn the page.    


At some point, you’ll start to feel sleepy. This is the key to this method. Close your eyes when this happens and don’t put the kindle or button away. The reason why this is important is because once you put the book to the side, you are telling your brain it has to commit to sleeping now. By leaving it as it is you are telling it that if you’re not ready for sleep, all you have to do is open your eyes and continue reading. Since you’re not commiting to sleep, the brain most likely won’t drift to all the invasive thinking that keeps an active brain awake.    



When I first started doing this, It was often I would open my eyes back up again, as I just wasn’t ready to drift off yet. Now that I’ve been doing it for so many years, usually the first time I close my eyes is the last time I do. Not always though.   

If this sounds like something you’d like to try and aren’t a reader, I could help you figure out what kind of books you would like. I am a huge speculative and science fiction fan. I have recommendations for days."

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"ASMR or Audiobooks, I can't sleep in silence. ASMR is more just to calm me down, Audiobooks actually help me fall asleep. It gives me something to focus on so I'm not: a) cycling (thoughts go brrr), or b) thinking about trying to get to sleep, which always makes it harder to fall asleep.

Its basically a distraction tactic, but in a way that is soothing and less stimulating. I just lay down and listen, and I fall asleep before I notice I'm falling asleep."
How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"I had major sleeping disorders for years and am still struggling with them every now and then... I know how you feel. I think there were many practices that helped me (I didn't do them all at once or consistently, but when I felt they could help me):

- Writing a small journal of what I did today and what I want to do the next few days, so I'm not thinking about all of that and moving around a lot because of that
- Drinking enough water and/or tea throughout the day, but not too much for bed. Also I go to the toilet before bed, I can never sleep when I have to pee and sometimes I don't notice it until I get up and just go the toilet after one hour of just lying there
- Digital hygiene by putting on bedtime mode on my phone, so that the screen goes warm (lessening blue light from the screen) around 5-6pm, and going full monochrome like an hour before bed and of course muting notifcations and rings
- Not doing something stimulating for the 1-2 hours before bed because else I just cannot rest at all afterwards most of the time and start fidgeting a lot
- And lastly, what helped a lot was just relaxing my muscles by tensing them all at once for a couple of seconds (by making fists, activating all muscles in the face, etc.), then letting them loose at the same time and then saying something repeating in your head (like just ""don't think, don't think, ...). That did the trick quite often.

Hope anything of the above will help you :)"

It helped if it was a problem that had a few elements to keep track of, but not too many. I found it gave me something to focus on so my brain didn't keep jumping around to random subjects.

But often it feels like that switch inside my brain that makes it click over from 'wake' to 'sleep' is broken.

What seems to help the best for now is listening to sleep hypnosis/meditation on you tube while trying to sleep.  I have to get the sound level juuuust right, settle in, and simply listen.

It tends to quiet the talking in my head, and cues me to breathe just right, and within minutes (instead of lying in the dark awake for an hour) I'm asleep.  Well, until I have to get up to pee, but that's another story."

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"I don’t know if this is related to ADHD but I personally don’t have any problems with insomnia or actually falling asleep at all, even on stimulant medication. If I’m getting into bed and have the lights off and done everything I need to beforehand and listen to my body when I’m tired, I can usually fall asleep pretty easy within maybe 10-15 minutes max. My problem usually stems from not feeling like I have to force myself to stay awake and not go to sleep until I can get something done, whether it be a bedtime routine like brushing my teeth or taking a shower both of which I push off at night and procrastinate even though I don’t mean to, or getting a household chore like folding laundry done, or getting like schoolwork done. I feel like with really bad executive dysfunction I can’t control when I start a task so the only thing I can control is holding myself to things like preventing my day from ending until I get whatever it is done. But often that in and of itself isn’t a motivating factor and it just leads to me staying up through the night to get what I need to done, even if I’m tired. Which in turn, flips my circadian rhythm later and later. It’s a vicious cycle."
How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"I dont know how, but I pretty much fall asleep within 5 mins of putting my head on my pillow.

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"I do a form of meditation right before bed. I do some stretches to help my back. Then I lay on the ground with my butt up to the bed and my calves and feet resting on the bed. Then, I just focus on my breathing. if another though comes, I gently go back to my breathing. I have a timer set for 10 min. Start with 5 and work your way up to it. You want it to be short enough that you can stay relatively focused. Once you aren't getting through it without major lapses of focus, move up to 10 min. 

Once it goes off, I double-check and activate my alarms and lock myself out of my phone with an app called ""lock my phone,"" and then I get into bed.

Locking my phone before I get into bed is important as I will likely hop on reddit or tiktok, and then there goes that night.

I think of meditation like practicing focusing. Now, I may choose other things to meditate on, but it can't be something I will hyperfocus on. Things like: good memories, simple things that make me happy. I may also listen to calm instrumental music.

This has huge benefits. It forms a routine that helps with falling asleep faster. As well as improves sleep quality. I use an app that monitors my sleep and wakes me up when I'm in a more ""awake"" phase of sleep.(called ""sleep cycle"") It also measures sleep quality, and meditation shows a 19% increase in sleep quality for me. 

I use android, so I don't know if the apps mentioned are on apple."

eventually your brain will know and you just go to bed and fall asleep.

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,The more you worry about sleeping the less likely you are to fall asleep. Plenty of tips in here already stated but for me starting meditation years ago helped me realize my first sentence and learn to relax and let the day slip away and not panic about the next and the things I’ve been procrastinating on etc. There are still occasional bad days where I cant sleep hardly at all or wake up a couple hours into the night and toss and turn the rest of the night but they are few and far between I’d say once a month or so. Melatonin never worked for me cause it either made me drowsy the whole next day or it wouldn’t work at all cause I wasn’t getting the relaxation part right to fall asleep. I don’t routinely meditate anymore really but the principles are still there that I use most nights or I do a little unguided one in my head and that helps me in most cases if my brain is stubborn. Get a good sleep schedule going and I recommend using a smart watch to track your sleep to help with that. Those health apps that come on our phones basically give you tips and everything you need to know to do that. It has helped me get interested in getting the best sleep possible like a game I track on my phone. Good luck and remember it’s a journey like coping with adhd. There will be trial and error and learning as you go. It has taken me years to figure myself out and what works especially considering sleep.
How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"I used a white noise machine for quite a while, and it worked.

However, I sometimes find that once the sleep story is over, I wake up again and have to start a second one.  😂"

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"Edit: hey, I looked this up, and delayed sleep phase disorder is common in people with ADHD. Try melatonin!

What time do you go to bed? What time do you fall asleep? Is the latter consistent? If you consistently fall asleep at the same time but it's later than when you want, you may have delayed sleep phase disorder. If so, that's the best news you can get; it's treated with cheap melatonin you can get at any drug store.

I naturally fall asleep at 2 am. Huge doses of sleeping pills didn't help me at all if I try to go to bed earlier than that, but a little melatonin and I can sleep any time."
How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"It sounds like you’re experiencing insomnia now, but you don’t usually. Is that correct? 

Which could mean medications you may be taking, including OTC, may be causing insomnia for you — even if you didn’t have this side effect before. This happened to me in my 40s. I didn’t used to have problems with pseudoephedrine, an ingredient in many cold medications for nasal congestion (eg, DayQuil), that is a strong stimulant. And also used to make meth, a very strong stimulant."

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"I went to sleep therapy and it helped like crazy. I used to lay awake for 2-4 hours every night, worse to no sleep at all if I’d have to get up somewhat early. So next to good sleep hygiene, the one thing that really really worked for me was getting up at the same time every single day. 7:30 my alarm goes off and I’m out of bed. In the weekends as well. After a party night. Even if I fell asleep at 6:30. It’s though in the first 6 weeks and extremely though the first week, but I’ve been doing this since a year and have never slept this much in my life.

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"At first I used a guided meditation for sleep on the Medito app (it's ***free***! A great resource for meditation, guided breathing, relaxation, nature sounds, etc and also has a playlist to teach you how to meditate). You imagine you're on an endless staircase making your way down to something. As you go it gets darker and darker and you count every step. Eventually after a few hundred you fall asleep. Once I got used to that I started adding my own detail to it -- I imagine lush forests, fairytale landscapes, the seaside, etc (all at dusk, twilight, or sunset) and I'm on a long staircase that starts way up in the sky and I'm trying to get to the ground. Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn't. Lately I've just been imagining counting stars or sheep and that has worked fairly well. 

I also take melatonin and magnesium which get me to sleep in about half an hour. The melatonin has helped reprogram my brain into a more immediate ""I'm in bed, so it's time for sleep."" I journal most nights before bed to help get thoughts off my head, but I focus on the good stuff that happened today. Not in a toxic positivity way, but in a ""not everything is awful"" way, if that makes sense?  


TL;DR: Try Medito - it's ***free***! Melatonin and magnesium are cheap and may help. Keeping a journal may also help."

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"I downloaded the app Tappy: Self care fidgeter onto my phone probably a year and a half ago. It has a bunch of features that I think HAD to be intended for us folk. Things like:

1. Tapping the guy “Tappy” in the middle of your screen; you can change his face depending on “his”/your mood, and change haptics like the kind of vibration your phone makes every tap and if you want it to make a sound or not. It also counts how many total taps you have made

2. There’s a daily affirmation tab you can read and scroll through a few if you’re feeling really crappy. 

3. Over 20 fidgeting features to tap and interact with. 

4. An Arcade with in app games. With an app leaderboard. 

5. And the main reason I am telling you this: the Relaxation page. It has a bunch of noises that you can choose to play that keep going even when your phone is off. It can vibrate your phone too if you like to hold it in your hands when you sleep. My favourite noises are Rain, Thunder, and Jungle, but there are others like Wood Wick Candle, Cat Purring, and Train too

You can also pay $4.99 CAD monthly or $24.99 CAD annually for Tappy Plus, where you can access more sounds, the fidget spinner and more. 

I am not affiliated with this app at all, it just has helped me for over a year and I think it’s great."

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"I count to 3,000. The first week or so, I would get up to like 5500 because my mind would wander and then I’d lose count and then I’d still be awake after 3,000 so I’d keep counting. It would take hours of counting, thinking about other stuff/etc, counting, getting distracted, counting, etc to reach 3,000. Between 2-4, but that’s how many hours I would struggle to fall asleep for anyway, so I used that thought track to convince myself to keep counting every night even if it didn’t seem to help me fall asleep any faster. “Well, I’m still allowing myself to wander with my thoughts, which is what I’d be doing for these hours anyway, so what’s the big deal of adding in some counting?” kinda logic to motivate myself to do it each night.

Anyway, I did this every night. Counted until I fell asleep. Allowed my mind to wander to other thoughts whenever it wanted as long as I eventually got back to counting. 

A little over a month later, I almost always fall asleep right before 3,000 - usually in less than an hour. In the last week, I think my biggest struggle night capped at ~3,700 and like an hour and a half before I fell asleep, so not bad at all for a “bad” night now! 

Anyway, if you can convince yourself to try it each night for at least a month, you might find that it eventually clicks in for you! I didn’t even notice the gradual change, one morning I woke up and I was like, “oh shit I fell asleep in under 3k three nights in a row this week”. But it helps that I can remember the numbers and stuff the next day."

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"Trazadone. I actually have insomnia—I can fall asleep but staying asleep is a problem. I toss and turn a lot and wake up enough that I’m aware of it. So, the trazadone helps me stay asleep. 

It’s not a great idea but I do watch some YouTube videos. Recently had some junk journaling ASMR videos suggested and let me tell you, the sounds of paper flipping and stickers etc is very very soothing. 

Watching videos isn’t great, though. Your brain 
/pineal gland needs darkness to produce melatonin. The pineal gland is what regulates our circadian rhythm, so if there’s light from screens, it’s going to disrupt that and make it harder to fall asleep. I’ve been (slowly) trying to phase out watching videos after I get in bed. It’s become such a habit that it’s hard to break. 

All of that said, making sure you’re fully and completely comfortable in your bed is underrated. I slipped on some ice in early February and landed on my shoulder. That in turn caused a massive tear in my rotator cuff (unknown at the time). There was no comfortable position really. I mentioned it to my physical therapist and he basically said “if we’re comfortable when we sleep, we don’t roll over.” and suggested I get some pillows to prop up my arm so that it was at the same level as my shoulder . I picked up 3 more pillows and tried it out. Life. Changing. I didn’t move once the whole night. I’ve since had surgery (May) but propping a long pillow behind my back and having pillows to tuck under my arm(s) have gone a long way to making sleep better."

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"I’ve found that sometimes when I’m tired/sleepy bit can’t actually fall asleep, I try to focus on doing deep breathing exercises so that I can physically relax my body and relieve some of that lingering nervous energy, which might be a barrier preventing me from falling asleep. 

I also tend to want to daydream a lot while I’m trying to sleep, and I’ve realised that this often is just triggering my brain to continue to stay alert and delaying the process of allowing my body and mind to relax to a point where I can actually sleep. So whenever I notice this, I try to focus on emptying my brain and resisting the temptation to continue engaging in whatever thought pattern has my attention at that moment. 

If I’m struggling with my brain feeling unstimulated/wanting to think about something, I’ll try and focus on something monotonous like counting my breaths or counting to the highest number I can. If none of these strategies work after a certain amount of time, I’ll try a low dose of melatonin (ideally on top of these other strategies and that’s usually enough."

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"I notice that when I get a good 9 hours of sleep, I feel better and my ADHD symptoms are not nearly as bad and I feel like I don’t have as much brain fog. In addition, my mood is better. When I have an insanely busy week, and don’t want to forget to mention that I’m medicated. I must keep a regular dose regiment and a regimented bed routine to maximize the quality of sleep. If I take my meds too late, or an eaten one to get through a late work event, then my sleep cycle gets screwed up quickly. That results in being tired and maybe taking an extra dose of meds to help with having a building sleep deficit, which will usually backfire only compounding things, making cognitive  function worse until you reach a point where your brain is mush and you finally crash. 

Last, I used my Apple Watch to track my nightly sleep. I’ve found on night where I get deep sleep, even if it’s only 30 minutes, that makes a huge difference. I also use and just got a new CPAP. Using that nightly makes. Huge difference in how alert I am when I wake up, and how quickly I get ready and to work. 

Falling asleep, that’s always been a crap shoot. Some nights I can go right to sleep. Most nights I toss and turn for N hour or two and have had nights where I don’t fall asleep at all. Keeping a consistent regimented schedule is the best way to entire proper sleep and being productive the next day."

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"i'm sure someone else has probably suggested something similar, but i cannot recommend something like Headspace's sleepcasts enough. they're like a podcast but meant to be more relaxing. they have a ton of different narrators so even if you're picky about disembodied voices like myself, there'll be at least one person you like. they start with a short and sweet meditation exercise and then is a 30-40 minute story. this gives me something to focus on and think about that isn't as distracting as a normal podcast or tv show or something (and doesn't require a screen to be on, helping with sleep hygiene). 

my number 1 issue with tips to meditate to sleep is no matter how hard i try, i cannot focus on the meditation, i always wind up distracted. having the story to listen to was a great way to bridge that, plus you can continue whatever exercise they start off with while listening to the story so it's an extra thing to think about (ie your breathing plus the story). i listen to one of these literally every single night and it's been revolutionary in helping me get to sleep. on particularly hard nights, i might go through 2 before actually getting to sleep but even that is better than the normal 2-3 hours. also, if i wake up in the middle of the night and have trouble getting back to sleep, i'll throw one on as a little reset. 

i know headspace is expensive but honestly i find it worth it for the sleepcasts alone, i rarely use it for anything else. but i'm sure there are other options out there that are free or less expensive than the headspace subscription."

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"If you don't have it, seek a disturbance-free room. I'm married (no children), but we have single bedrooms for both of us, so we can actually sleep without distracting each other. This is a must-have!And then I do the following:

Step 1: watching a nice and comfy ASMR video (with headphones). I really love roleplays, so I can engage with a storyline, being a little cared for, so to speak.Step 2: drinking some hot lavender tea while watching (lavender sometimes can help me relax, I also use lavender smell candles)Step 3: going to bed, when I'm actually really tired, not when I have to.Step 4: clicking on a documentary or ambient (bonfire or something) video, so there will be calming blah-blah and cracking fire in the background.

As I am already relaxed and focused on something nice, it doesn't take long to fall asleep. I play these videos or playlists (Youtube) on my laptop sitting right next to my bed, so I can watch the content for several minutes if I want. I need to listen to the video further, so my mind won't start babbling on its own. I can't stop thinking, that's why I give my brain something to chew on.

What I absolutely need to add is lifestyle. I mean, if you have active days, your brain will be totally stressed out from all the stimuli and happenings, so it will spiral as soon as your surroundings quiet down. (Is this even a sentence, Idk.)I suffered from severe parasomnia when I had full and active days with work, sports, hobby and everything. Now that I'm selfemployed and went into hermit mode, my brain is not stressed out anymore (and if anything happens in my life, my brain will tell me how it affects me negatively, because my sleep quality will go down).Living a rather peaceful, calm and quiet life has helped me a lot!"

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"I started utilizing bilateral stimulation music with an eye mask a few days ago out of desperation because I’ve barely been sleeping for weeks. I didn’t get my hopes up because even though all the information I’d read was optimistic, it just felt impossible anymore.

Well, I actually started SLEEPING THROUGH THE NIGHT. The trick is to have headphones comfortable enough to wear while laying down. I popped on my eye mask to block out and/all light source stimulation and popped the headphones in my ears and then laid down and let the magic happen. 

Disclaimer: I’ve also been hella depressed lately so I don’t have the best environmental control group, but I can say this: My depression has never positively benefited my sleeplessness. It’s only ever made it worse. So I’m thinking the improvement is more so related to the new form of stimulation than my moods. 

There are playlists on YouTube and Pandora that I know of, probably plenty elsewhere too. I try to focus in on the “bilateral stimulation SLEEP music” criteria for nighttime use, though. 

Hope it helps."

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"So back when I was a kid/teenager, I'd sometimes be lying awake for quite a while, and would take to staring at my digital clock, being the only source of light in the room.

I devised a game to play with it I called, ""Eights and Naughts,"" where I would watch the clock, and in my mind, break apart the digits into their constituent 'blocks'* and try to rearrange them to make the most zeros or eights I could, with the least amount of surplus or negative blocks afterwards.

So e.g. if it was 11:47, I could use the 2 blocks from each '1' to make the '7' into a '0', with 1 block left. The '4' would need 2 blocks to make a zero, so I'd have -1 blocks left over, which I'd hope to make up when it flips to 11:48.
When 11:48 comes around, that 8 is already full, so I could use 3 blocks from the 2 '1's to turn the '4' into an '8', leaving me with a surplus of 1 block that would cancel my deficit from the previous minute.

I would play this game with myself until I fell asleep, which sometimes took 10-25 minutes, but usually only took a few minutes, as I'd get bored waiting for the next minute, start doing all the math in my head ahead of time, and fall asleep while calculating 3 or 4 minutes out.

* ""Blocks"" or whatever you want to call the lights on an old digital clock that would light up or not to make up the numbers. 8's used 7; 0's used 6; 1's used 2; 2's, 3's & 5's used 5; 4's used 4; 7's used 3; 6's & 9's used 6."

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"I have a few things I do (not always) to help me get to bed.

1. I make sure my bedroom is cold enough to make it feel really cozy in bed (this is harder in summer since I don't have AC).

2. If I know I can't sleep or will have a hard time I do some stretches before sleep. Nothing too intense, the point is to relax my body and focus a bit on my breathing. This helps make me more comfortable in bed and makes my mind a bit more quiet. I find it easier than regular meditation because your body becomes a big fiddle toy. It also helps the ""crashing"" process as you will feel a little more tired after doing so.

3. An hour before I go to bed I start to mentally prepare. I go to bed around 11 PM, so by 10 PM it's ""before bedtime time"". I try to not het into a new TV show, if I can I want to turn off all my screens (this really happens irl tho). The most important thing is that I don't start anything new (no hyperfixation possibilities) and that I just take some time to transition. I feel this helps with revenge procrastination, as you give yourself an hour of just being there. I sometimes make myself a cup of tea, play with my cat, etc. 

4. Make sure my bedroom is DARK. I'm a super light sleeper so it has to be dark, or I will wake up. I also wear good quality reusable earplugs meant for side sleepers whenever I know there will be noise (if my partner doesn't come to bed immedietly for example)"
How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"Ok,  this is a crazy answer,  and requires discipline and practice,  but here you are:

- you need transplant yourself into a reality where none of your usual thoughts are going to bother you. I like to visualise an 18th century farm labourers hut.

- Then,  you get fully dressed in imaginary clothes that have nothing to do with your own life.  (So, I get dressed into 18th century farm labourers clothes)

If at any point your mind wanders,  you have to start again (this is where the discipline comes into it)

- Then, when you're fully dressed in the imaginary clothes, you have to do an imaginary repetitive task that has nothing to do with your real life. So, for me,  that's harvesting barley by hand and tying into into sheafs. It's important to focus on the imaginary sensory info. (Hot sun, prickley barley stems etc)

Go do a minor task (put some objects away, write a couple paragraphs etc). Dont turn on screens or blue lights. When the task is done, lay back down.

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"The way I think about it is, you'll never fall asleep if you are outside of your mind or aware of anything outside of your body; so if you are paying attention to sounds, light or smells etc. I have to find a way to stay in my mind for as long as possible without recognising anything outside of it. The best way I do it is think of the longest routine or steps of an activity I can, and then double down and break those steps down into smaller steps and imagine doing/ describe them in vivid detail. So I usually go for my morning routine. I explain it to myself in my head, what it looks like etc. So I say I wake up, then I roll over, then I turn off my alarm etc etc in so much detail. If I snap out of my mind I have to start again. Works for me most of the time. It could be breaking down cooking a recipe, explaining a board game to someone in your head. :)"

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,I play music just below where I think I can hear it. So when my mind finally quiets down I can hear the music a little bit and my mind doesn’t wonder elsewhere. And music that is calm enough to put me to sleep but something happy enough that I’m still interested in and keeps the thoughts in my head neutral or positive. That and tucking the sheets under my sides so I can’t toss n turn. And with my arm over my eyes and ear it helps to keep my eyes from opening our loud noises ruining my sleep. For some reason the Harry’s House album has been great for this for me.

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"I have the problem ""stay up late and go to bed when I cannot stay awake anymore"" BUT as I already wrote in an another post : I have a method to sleep fast even with my adhd :) ( that does not work if you don't go to bed, personally I have a alarm ""go to the bed :)).

  
I force my mind to go in my imaginary world (I use a method since I am a child )  
My bedroom has no screens and nothing in it is related to my active live . As soon as I pass the door, I stop thinking about work, live, news, shopping list etc and begin to imagine stuff . The easiest way is to replace the hero of a series or a book your like by you (kind of ""what if"" story). I always fall asleep in the beginning of my story \^\^ . I think it's because that because I am not thinking about reality, that doesn't stress or focus me :).

I put some extra effort to sleep more because when I sleep enough => better moral, adhd is more regulated , I support better the medication and the effect stays longer, i do more stuff so I have less things to worry about so it's easier to sleep (and hop the loop is closed :))"

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"This should be top comment. Great advice. 

If you have a partner, consider this: 

A few years ago I got super stoned, this was before getting medicated/diagnosed, I came to bed with my fiancé with my mind running amok. She often falls asleep in minutes (literally timed it to 3 minutes flat out snoring sometimes haha) so this time I just listened to her breathing. I noticed it changed as she was falling asleep, getting deeper with slight pauses at the peak and valley, so I focused my attention on her breath and tried best to copy it. Moments pass and I feel calm, asleep in minutes. This was it for me, before I would lay there for hours sometimes and get frustrated that I just couldn’t stop my brain from doing brain things. 

Later I learned that this is similar to a practice called box breathing, a form of meditation, that helps change our thought patterns and can regulate our nervous system. 

Good luck fellow humans."

So much of how we live as humans goes against the natural order of things. Like doing certain things just because it’s a certain time (e.g., waking up from an alarm clock, going to sleep because it’s bedtime, eating food because it’s lunch time etc). 

I just listen to what my body tells me to do"

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,BBT for the win. I’ve seen it so many times I know it well enough that it sort of helps me drift off. I can even do it with Friends or Brooklyn 99. I’m almost not listening but it’s enough to stop me thinking of something else. I also need almost complete darkness so it was nice finding out I can turn the screen off and then set the timer for 90 minutes. Some days I’m gone in 5 minutes and sometimes I get back up and watch something for an hour. I worry less about falling asleep and understand that sometimes I will just have a crap night. However what surprises me is not all 4 hour sleeps are equal. Sometimes I feel great. Sometimes 7 hours can feel worse. All my Fitbit acknowledges is that deep and rem sleep seem to be important.

— Rang and dumped someone. Having a phonecall is in itself out of character for me. On the plus side, I _did_ want to break up with them. 

— Went to the supermarket and did my shopping. Two friends talked to me while I was out. 

— Woke up standing at the side of a busy road.

When I made sleep a priority, it’s been helping with the adhd symptoms. 

I say tbis at 2 am, unable to sleep for no reason other than… it’s another day. I cycle.  I get about 3 days of stellar sleep, stay up too late one night because I’ve found something to focus on and then the next few nights I sleep like crap.  

Most of my life I went to bed last and got up first and one of my mottos was “I’ll sleep when I’m dead”…. I have worried about missing “something” if I am sleeping for as long as I can remember.  

I live alone.. not going to miss anything going on while I sleep. Lol

Therapist asked me how my sleep was… normal, I said.  Because i didn’t realize this pattern.  

It used to be, all these years, the nights i can’t sleep I toss and turn and bitch and moan and be miserable. Now if feel that toss/turn feeling come on I do some deep breathing, that doesn’t work I get up and have a cup of coffee and usually with in 2 hours I start nodding and that’s the cue for bed. ;)

Often wake up refreshed… but now in my 6th decade I take more naps.  Often I go back to bed in the morning after I feed my diabetic cat.

I'd love to feel less like it's because I'm broken and more like it's because I'm different 💖💖💖

Edit: **Wowwwwww**

>The sleep time of people who have N24SWD shifts a little later every day. Sleep time and wake up time continue to move later and later every day. Sleep times go in and out of alignment with other people as weeks go by.

I've literally been doing this for my entire life, this is insane. I thought it was just because I was a stoner/acid head with no self control as a teen and then just something I couldn't break myself out of after getting sober for the past two decades O_O (the fact that I started doing this like 8 years before I started getting high just seemed like some sort of destiny thing, I guess lol) It's amazing the way, as I get older, all my negative self-talk seems to come from external sources and cultural assumptions about myself rather than being deserved sources of self-loathing 🤔🤔🤔"

How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour?,"Keep a close eye. Seroquel as a sleep aid is effective in the sense that it is sedating, but it has a high side effect profile, and many clinicians believe these outweigh the benefits — it affects hyperlipidemia (_both_ reduces ‘good’ cholesterol _and_ raises ‘bad’ cholesterol), insulin resistance, and reduces insulin secretion.

On weekends and days off I try not to take it at all and just stay up, until my eyes burn and then get up early the next day, so I’d crash earlier. My dog forces me, so that definitely helps.

managing clonidine side effects ,I have heard taking it before bed manages this side effect well - don't feel nausea in your sleep I guess? My kid took this for a bit and did not have this side effect.
managing clonidine side effects ,Been on it year and half no puking also severely emetophobia getting off of it tho just got prescribed a stimulant for adhd is that cause nadeau vomiting scared to try it
managing clonidine side effects ,I resorted to being prescribed ondansetron bc I can’t function due to the nausea and muscle weakness
managing clonidine side effects ,"I did wonder if taking it before sleeping makes the side effects more manageable, so it's good to know that it went well for your kid at least. Thanks for reassuring me on that!"

Strattera + Wellbutrin + Clonidine = Success?,"Wellbutrin my pcp prescribed off label for inattentiveness pre psych diagnosis of adhd inattentive, worked wonders for my adhd symptoms and I loved it at 300xl but made me super anxious after a few weeks of it working really well. 

It’s hard to tell when you’re taking meds that treat symptoms of adhd, depression and anxiety. 

But if it’s working for you it’s a win! And keep up with your docs recommendations. 

Honestly wish I could go back on Wellbutrin, was one of the best 2 weeks of my life adhd symptoms wise 

Best of luck"
Strattera + Wellbutrin + Clonidine = Success?,"Glad you are seeing improvements! If it makes you feel better I don't think stimulants for me are worth the crash and anxiety it can cause. If I can get on a non-stimulant regimen that provides me with some extra motivation to start tasks and stay focused with them then I will be ecstatic. 

Taking focalin made me realize how much of a shell of a human life I have been living since it improved my mood significantly and helped me to want to socially interact with others but crashed hard, blood pressure was high and sometimes my anxiety spiked crazy hard with it. Plus only lasted like 2-3 hours before that crash, it was also inconsistent. 

Again glad that non stimulants are working for you, it gives me hope! Let me know if it is still working well for you and if you mind telling me which medication helped the most with motivation and improving mood? My psych would most likely just prescribe 1 non stimulant for awhile to try first."

Strattera + Wellbutrin + Clonidine = Success?,"Hey I have never tried Wellbutrin but I am interested in it since other stimulants i've tried aren't working. What I have read though is that Wellbutrin can make you feel a bit off around the two week mark but a lot of people i've seen say if you can stick it out till the 4th week or so then that goes away. Not saying it will for sure in your case but may be worth a shot if you're saying you were feeling better on it. In my case i'm worried about that same thing, I would maybe need clonidine later with it to help with anxiety/blood pressure if those symptoms didn't subside."
Strattera + Wellbutrin + Clonidine = Success?,"Went to a different doc, got a diagnosis, and am now on Adderall, Wellbutrin & Lexapro."
Strattera + Wellbutrin + Clonidine = Success?,"How is that combination going? I’m currently on Wellbutrin and about to start Concerta tomorrow. Just concerned bc when I tried Vyvanse by itself about 4 months ago it only lasted about 3 hours before I’d crash and feel crappy the rest on the day. So now I’m worried they all aren’t going to last long and give me horrible crashes. Anyway, she’s also wanting me to try Lexapro for my anxiety but I’m just so nervous about that bc it’s an SSRI and I just now finally got my sex drive back with the wellbutrin lol and I’m also finally losing a little weight and have a little motivation that I’m worried the Lexapro might counteract.
Just curious how it’s going for you with that combination?"

Doctor suggested I try Clonidine, Started taking it this week to help wind down and sleep
Doctor suggested I try Clonidine,"It helped me with sleep, focus and blood pressure, but I had to stop bc it made me depressed.

It actually gave me more focus than stimulants."
Doctor suggested I try Clonidine,How has it been thus far ?
Doctor suggested I try Clonidine,"My dr added bupropion back in bc I found guanfacine causing me to slip into a depression. So far, so good. No issues. I noticed I have more focus with guanfacine than the stim. Or at least better working memory and my brain doesn't get tired."
Doctor suggested I try Clonidine,I’m taking bupropion during the day and the Clonidine at night after I get my daughter to sleep
Doctor suggested I try Clonidine,"Um tbh first couple nights really made me sleepy. 

I still need to take me otc sleep aid to fall asleep but I will say it definitely helps wind me down but nothing crazy."
Doctor suggested I try Clonidine,Thax for your insight.
Doctor suggested I try Clonidine,"My sleep dr puts people on clonidine and guanfacine for insomnia and sleep issues. He said both can help with adhd as well. Who knew? LOL. He asked me to pick one and/or if I want to compare the other drugs, he can write it as well. Plus, he said some patients respond to one more than the other. Overall he had positive things to say about them. 

Right now I'm on guanfacine and bupropion. I was surprised at my brain turning on by the guanfacine. It's subtle, but helps my exec function. My friend takes clonidine and has great success with exec function as well."
Doctor suggested I try Clonidine,"So are you taking it during the day ? I’ve only taken it at night so far but sometimes I feel like I’m so wound up from the bupropion I should take it.

I guess is your friend taking it during the day I think guanfacine is similar to."
Doctor suggested I try Clonidine,"My docs suggested I try different times of day/night. Right now, I switched from night to day for the guanfacine. I would do night, but I am finding my body gets tired, but my brain turns on. Go figure. That might go away once the drug is in my system."

"Started Clonidine, first night and day were ok, massive insomnia the 2nd night, anxiety the next day.","start lower, see my post about clonidine success. take half the sleep dose in the morning. nor-epinephrine is still important for the effects of ADHD medication. your brain doesn't only read the ""levels"" to release a signal, but also the peaking and lowering of catecholamines. nor-epinephrine in the CNS peaks around 2-4 PM and slowly lowers throughout the day. these peaks and lows are what modulates most of your system. sleepyness goes away yea, first time i took half a dose at like 5PM because i just got the meds and i was hella anxious after my dexamp, slept long. now i use half 0.025 in the mornings and a full pill at night and it still induces sleep pretty hard. i also recommend building up the dose especially the morning dose to reduce the initial sleepyness of starting off on clonidine. in the beginning i didn't even use it in the morning, only started of with evening. i take mine around 8 AM and 8 PM, 12 hours inbetween doses is good to keep your tolerance for the evening dose low which helps in inducing sleep better."
"Started Clonidine, first night and day were ok, massive insomnia the 2nd night, anxiety the next day.","thanks.  What I've been doing that seems to work is 0.025mg in the morning and nothing at night.   My sleep is still worse than without Clonidine, but it is tolerable.   Interestingly, I get no drowsiness from it at all.   I plan to work my way up"

"adderall, wellbutrin, & clonidine??","I’m on a great trio of adderall (tabs), Wellbutrin and trazodone. I’ve been medicated and diagnosed for almost 21 years. I’m about to be 40 and have been trying to find my “golden ticket” since 19. I think I finally found it! 


Have you tried taking the Wellbutrin at night before bed?

The XRs just don’t work as well for me. I’ve tried and tried and tried again. I don’t have as much trouble sleeping or anxiety in the evenings with the tabs. 

Having a prescriber that trusts, *listens to you*, and is willing to try new things …. Is key. Keep trying!! It’s a process!"
"adderall, wellbutrin, & clonidine??",Everyone is different but I take 7 - 5 of which affect my brain - whatever helps man - I would probably be dead without them so as much as I hate choking them down I do
"adderall, wellbutrin, & clonidine??",I combo 3 meds similar to yours. Everyone is different in chemistry and the pharmacology of a med. You do you with your doc! :)
"adderall, wellbutrin, & clonidine??","Yea absolutely, I forget how much more miserable I am off of meds sometimes. I just wish there was a test you could take that would just give you the best med combo for you without having to go through all the shitty ones first."
"adderall, wellbutrin, & clonidine??","They do have those for SSRIs, I believe. 

My PCP mentioned it to me a couple times. She said she would order it if I wanted, but I’ve never been on SSRIs and my family history suggests I should avoid if possible."
"adderall, wellbutrin, & clonidine??","I've heard about that test, not sure if it would be covered by insurance or anything but I've tired a few different SSRIs and they weren't great for me either. And the withdrawal from zoloft lasted months for me, not sure I'd be willing to try another after that. Bummer they haven't made it for all the other ones yet."
"adderall, wellbutrin, & clonidine??","It might be worth giving your insurance a call and inquiring!

I have a mom friend that did it after decades of struggling to find her “golden ticket.” The test showed literally everything she had tried was not compatible/effective on her brain juices (yes, that’s the technical term ;-). Within 30 days of the test results and new meds she was like a whole new person."
"adderall, wellbutrin, & clonidine??","Thats amazing, definitely gonna bring that up at my next appointment!"

Stopped guanfacine and clonidine two months ago - still withdrawing?,"It could be the clonidine side effects for sure. I’m trying to wean off i was prescribed 0.1 in morning and at night for high blood pressure (i have ADHD but switched from Vyvanse to Dexedrine now). But i find 0.1 in morning is really prone to depression or melancholy if any stressful situation arises. I ran it by my doctor and tried to do 0.5mg for morning 0.5mg for afternoon and 0.1 before bed. I found after the morning dose, after about half-way thru the day it causes me to have withdrawal like symptoms- shortness of breath (blood pressure goes up) and start getting melancholy (possibly lack of oxygen). I tried 0.1mg in morning today- big mistake. Felt depressed “numb” feeling which is not normal for me. I know the difference between sadness and pain but this was pure disconnection from reality (and not in dissociative way). Would definitely talk to your doctor about the side effects and maybe weaning off if possible."

How long does it take to adjust to clonidine?,"Currently trying out clonidine with my 6 year old and honestly? I'm not seeing that significant of a change. The first dose knocked him out which was concerning but I monitored him and he seemed fine the next day and had raving reviews from his teacher. The second day he didn't seem any different than his normal bouncy hyperactive inattentive self but could at least hold a conversation with me without darting all over the place. Day 3? He might as well be not taking anything. I think this is one of those meds that has a slight affect and mostly is supposed to help with sleep which then makes ADHD symptoms not as bad. But, the dose would probably have to be increased and I just don't know if it's even worth it. I think it depends on the kid, what type he is, and whether you've gone through the trial and error of other meds. I've not been able to find a lot on it versus Guanfacine but I want to say it's one of those that takes time to really get in their system and work. 2-3 weeks I would say."

I’m on Strattera and Clonidine and it’s working really well for most things for my also adhd combo, especially racing thoughts, decision making, anxiety and sleep but I’m very fatigued during the day, slightly numbed at times and lacking focus still."
"Strattera, Wellbutrin & Clonidine combo",I take 120mg Strattera and 0.8mg Clonidine and 20mg Escitalopram everyday i have added clonidine only a week ago it does help me fall asleep and calms my brain but i want to see how it improves my focus we need to find out whether Clonidine reduces the effects of of Strattera or increases it because Clonidine reduces norepinephrine but Strattera increases Norepinephrine
"Strattera, Wellbutrin & Clonidine combo",I want to ask for Wellbrutin but I’m also on 100 Sertraline / Zoloft so bit worried about serotonin syndrome. Is your blood pressure ok on your combo?
"Strattera, Wellbutrin & Clonidine combo","I think i might feel a little more focused but i am exhausted by the end of the day. 
To answer your question, Wellbutrin doesn't affect serotonin.  It's an NDRI. Wellbutrin and Zoloft are commonly prescribed together"
"Strattera, Wellbutrin & Clonidine combo","Thanks for your reply, it’s really helpful. It’s early days but The Clonidine hasn’t affected my blood pressure too much and I have slightly low blood pressure naturally.  Maybe the Strattera is keeping it even. But it does make me foggy next day. Hoping will be gone in a few weeks. Good luck. Hope the combo works well for you."

Clonidine withdrawal?,"Hey. Just saw this post. I've been wanting to read about others experiences with Clonidine.

Just making sure you're OK. Did you end up going to hospital? Chest pain especially in the areas you described aren't ever something you should ignore.

This medication effects blood pressure so stopping cold turkey can be dangerous.

Stay safe please!"
Clonidine withdrawal?,"I have had horrible side effects and withdrawing from it since Thurs (3 days.) I have body aches, shivering, warm sometimes, cold, horrible headaches, nausea to name a few. I have hardly any energy. I hate it."
Clonidine withdrawal?,Didn’t end up going to the hospital. Ended up just riding out the side effects which last about a week and a half. Now I’m on Atomoxetine which has been a LOT better for me.
Clonidine withdrawal?,MY BODY HURTS😭 i feel like throwing up and i can’t sleep
Clonidine withdrawal?,"Well. I'm glad you're OK. 

I take Clonidine at night, but forget to take it often and sometimes find it's hit and miss. Some nights it'll relax me and help me to switch off and other nights I'm still wide awake and up until 2am trying to solve all of the world's problems haha.

I definitely find stims are effective during the day. I'm seeing my doctor next week so I'll ask him about Atomexetine.

Thanks for responding :)"
Clonidine withdrawal?,"Did you get off the clonidine ok? I thought I was just maybe getring sick but I have been weaning off. Down to 1/4 of .1mg 1x/pm. I'm actually am bummed to have to get off because it does wonders for my nervous system, but it gives me terrible GI issues. But coming off it sucks so bad."
Clonidine withdrawal?,"Are you still on clonidine at night? I’ve been having insomnia starting around the time I started clonidine and it’s just as you describe. Sometimes I’m fine, others I don’t sleep for three days with no good explanation."
Clonidine withdrawal?,I’m good it wasn’t that bad took something to counter act the blood pressure aka some weird sleeping valerian root combination from cvs lmao
Clonidine withdrawal?,"I take it sometimes to force myself to sleep and it definitely works, but doesn't last. So I had it a couple of nights back and was feeling tired as an hour later at 10pm so went to sleep like a ""normal person"" does. I woke up at 2am feeling wide awake and had to toss and turn for half an hour to get back to sleep.

The following night I didn't take anything and was up until 3am and still wide awake. I had to force myself to go to bed and put some TV on to quiet my racing thoughts down.

It's almost as if it gives you a sleep so good that the following night you don't feel as tired haha"
Clonidine withdrawal?,Interesting! I will keep that in mind. Did it have a calming effect?
Clonidine withdrawal?,Definitely
Clonidine withdrawal?,Sleep support 8-in-1 with valerian root and it’s a white bottle with purple label
