Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"You May feel anger. The reason I say this is because once you start medicine, you’ll realize how much BETTER your QOL could have Been if you how gotten diagnosed earlier. For me I had the most obvious symptoms but I was routinely ignored and dismissed. At 24 I was finally put on Straterra and my QOL improved pretty rapidly. That’s when the anger came. Mad at my parents for not doing a thing because kids shouldn’t be on medication"
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,Drink water and EAT. No matter what eat some food. Even if you have to force it down your throat or use a meal replacement shake. Just eat and if you ever swift to an amphetamine based medication don’t take anything with vitamin c until the evening. Even one glass of juice and I’ll get a nasty crash. And I NEVER crash from my meds. IR or long acting I don’t crash. I had some apple cider and  a few hours later I had a crash and I was getting a ride home from my close friend and sentences became hard lol. Vitamin c will have effect on Ritalin and there are a million different adhd stimulants on the market here in the US so it’ could take a super long time to find the right combo but if you’re executive function is suffering and you and your body react well to being on a stimulant then it’s worth the effort. Everyone gets started on Ritalin but I reacted terribly to Ritalin even though I was productive. I’m on vyvanse and Dexedrine nowadays. This combo works for me

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"The initial reaction depends on the person. The reason a lot of people say they don’t feel anything is because ADHD meds don’t add a new feeling, they subtract previous feelings. Take executive dysfunction: instead of feeling much more functional when I’m on meds, I just don’t have the barrier between me and a task when I go to do one. Lookout for changes in yourself, because it might not feel immediate.

I take my meds in the morning, but see when your doctor tells you to take them, there are usually instructions with your meds.

Caffeine mixed with meds reaction varies from people to person, some people have one, some people don’t. If you’re already sensitive to caffeine (get caffeine jitters from drinking too much etc), I’d suggest skipping it, if not, try it out if you want to.

Don’t mix alcohol and ADHD meds. Also, don’t eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice with ADHD meds, it can sometimes impede absorption. 

Side effects also differ from person to person, but the most consistent ones are difficulty sleeping and loss of appetite. The appetite loss is one you have to work around by finding how you can remind yourself to eat without natural cues from your body, but I suggest things like eating before you take your meds, prepping meals, setting reminders, and other things like that. Find out what works best for you.

Sleep can be difficult, stuff like setting a reminder to go to bed and keeping your phone away from you at night can help. If it gets really bad, talk to your doctor about it. 

Overall, the world of difference medication makes is really amazing, so I’m excited for you!"
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Sooo much to say about this, maybe I should compile a list for people. For context, I’m 28F, diagnosed May of this year, have been on medication since late May of this year. 

1. Every medication is different for everyone. Seriously, your twin could have an amazing experience on the lowest dose of Ritalin, but you  might need the highest dose of Adderall. It differs wildly between people. 

2. Don’t get discouraged if it takes awhile to figure out what works for you because of #1. Adjust your expectations to avoid being super demoralized. You might get it on the first try, it might take awhile and that’s okay! I’m on my fourth med and many dose changes between the 4 and I think I’m close, not quite there yet after almost 7 months. Don’t let this scare you, just be aware and at peace with the process. I wasn’t and it hurt my experience. 

3. Track everything. Start a note in your phone. “Ritalin, x mg, November 25th, Day 1, took at x:xx am.” Update it everyday throughout the day. Write down every symptom/side effect you experience and how you felt with your normal tasks/routines throughout the day. Include what you ate and how you slept the night before. I know routines like this are counterintuitive to ADHD, but try to set 3 times to do it throughout the day or try to catch up for a day or two when you remember. Since ADHD memory can be less than great, this method is REALLY helpful to recognize patterns in how you’re doing and how the meds are helping (or not).

4. If you feel like your behavior or emotional state is changing negatively, consider that it might be the meds. Don’t ignore it or chalk it up to external factors. When I took Ritalin, I started getting really really depressed and aggressive and wasn’t doing well. I thought it was because the stress in my life had gone up and I was caring for my fiancée who was isolated in our bedroom and extremely sick with COVID while I slept on the couch for 2 weeks. It wasn’t those things, it was the medication, and I suffered for quite awhile before realizing it. Everything was better as soon as I got off. Really not saying this will happen to you on Ritalin, turns out I personally have a lot of weird gene-drug interactions to a lot of things that most people don’t, but any negative behavior change on any med should be paid attention to right away. 

5. To follow-up on gene-drug interactions, if you feel like you’re struggling to find meds that work well for you, especially if your provider considers using something off label like Wellbutrin or Effexor instead of a stimulant, consider genetic testing like Genesight. I don’t know why this isn’t a first-line thing for psychiatry at this point. It can tell you of your body has any major negative predispositions to certain medications and whether you may experience negative gene-drug interactions. There are only a couple of ADHD meds that have proven genetic markers, but it is still very useful for these few and for a long list of depression/anxiety meds, some of which are used off-label for ADHD. It can also tell you about certain gene mutations or metabolic things that may change your reactions to medications. Don’t be afraid to try it, I wish I had earlier and have learned so much about myself!

6. Make sure to eat breakfast before taking meds, chug water throughout the day, and try to force yourself to eat before it wears off even if it’s hard. It’ll help the crash and low-blood sugar symptoms one it wears off and will help your mood during that transition. Electrolytes help a lot with this too, consider oral rehydration salts or something like Liquid IV or Pedialyte. 

7. No vitamin C close to when you take the meds, as it can severely impact absorption. If you’re taking a XR med, best to avoid things like orange juice throughout the day as the medication may release both immediately and later on. Check things for vitamin C content, it shows up in some surprising places. For example, I realized Liquid IV has vitamin C and I was drinking it before the second half of my meds kicked in. Surprise surprise, meds didn’t work those afternoons. 

8. Some meds cause heartburn symptoms. Don’t take Tums or Pepcid, etc. In the morning! At night is fine, but the calcium carbonate will affect absorption. Talk to your pharmacist or doctor about what daily heartburn med would be okay if you need it. I think omeprazole is the one that’s fine to take in the morning, but double check this if you need to take something. 

9. A lot of things can affect how well your meds work, unfortunately. It can be hard to figure out what’s impacting the efficacy the most. If you need to, try changing one thing at a time, like diet, sleep, etc. To figure out what impacts you most. Changing everything all at once is way too overwhelming. 

10. *Putting a star because this one is big!! HORMONES!!! Man, it reallyyy sucks that these meds were never really tested on females. It doesn’t happen to everyone, but hormone changes throughout the menstrual cycle can REALLY mess with ADHD symptoms and medication. For example, symptoms may really increase when estrogen drops after ovulation. For a lot of people, their meds just completely stop working during PMS and the first day of their period too (I am people, though a lot of folks discuss this, especially on r/adhdwomen) and there is little clinical information on why this happens. It can feel quite debilitating. If you notice this, talk to your doctor about having a booster dose for those days, or lifestyle changes that can help. And don’t hesitate to raise the issue, maybe one day enough doctors will take notice that there will be some useful research and results for women and AFAB people!!

Sorry this went on and on, and I realize some of these are general things to know rather than specific medication things. But, I wish I’d known all of these things before starting treatment, and while I like my doctor, I think doctors aren’t trained to give all of this information and I’ve found most of it out on my own. I hope this helps you too, or someone else who is starting this journey!! Good luck!!!"

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"You might feel a kind of mania, like superman or like you want to reconnect with everyone from the past or improve everyone's life like you're Oprah. This isn't how you're supposed to feel, and it will go away after awhile. Do not ask you doc to up the dosage based on the absence of this feeling. Keep your dose as low as you can for as long as possible. Drink water and eat protein and healthy fats!"
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Congrats on starting meds and I really hope it helps! From my experience I would say biggest thing is to realise that not all people react to different meds in the same way, it sometimes takes some time to work out what drug and dose is best for your body so don’t get frustrated if you don’t have the immediate reaction you’ve been anticipating. There was definitely a lot of trial and error at the beginning before I found what works best for me. 

Also the other thing I experienced (which may be different for everyone) is that once I finally got onto a stable and optimum dose of my current meds, I felt a lot lot better and am definitely way more functional, but it’s also like you suddenly have a toolbox of tools that you might not know how to use right away. For example I am still pretty shit at personal organisation and time management, but now that I can concentrate and organise my thoughts a bit more than before I’m better at making lists and trying to prioritise important tasks without getting overwhelmed. It’s all a learning process and takes time to learn how to do things so be patient with yourself. 

Sorry if that makes no sense and is too long to bear to read lol"
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"You're going to feel incredible for the first week or two if they agree with you. Calmer, more alert and present, even happy. It won't be that intensely life changing forever.

However, you can get the most out of it by eating a solid three meals (honestly don't overlook this one, it can't be said enough) with a good amount of protein. Drink lots of water. Don't take it past 6pm if you wanna sleep.

Don't expect it to flip a switch and completely transform your life - it will give you breathing space to be able to do what you need to do, and help you to do those things without being pulled in a million different directions, but ultimately you still have to figure out how to self motivate to just begin the task/activity. Once you get to that point though, just starting something, you'll be able to complete things easier. For me, the constant battle between doing the thing and doing literally anything else just dissolves once I force myself to start.

I found the biggest difference for me those first few days was that in terms of my thinking it was like I experienced time in a linear way for the first time in my life. I can take things as they are in their own right in the moment, without zipping ahead or jumping sideways in thought. The best example of this is having a simple conversation. I can listen to the words as they each come out of someone's mouth individually, without obsessing over what I want to say and trying to hold back from butting in but failing anyway. I can listen to someone tell a story or anecdote without snapping at them to get to point because I can't bare to listen to anything extraneous. Take note of how you talk to people, but more importantly, how you listen."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,Sometimes they just dont work. Doesnt necessarily mean you were misdiagnosed
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Caffeine has been fine for me. The biggest deal is to understand it may take 2-4 weeks to fully acclimate to your medicine. Teeth grinding and body clenching may exacerbate musculoskeletal issues. As you get used to the medicine these effects should dissipate, but it can take weeks not days"
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Can't speak for Ritalin, but if your experience on meds ends up being anything like mine after starting vyvanse, it could be life changing. You might feel capable of doing anything and everything you couldn't before. Don't take any newfound motivation/confidence for granted and consider some form of therapy alongside the medication to assist you in using the effects of the medication to establish as many routines and lifestyle changes as possible that could help you manage your adhd even if you didn't have the medication.

When starting vyvanse, I thought I had found the key to finally living a normal, productive, happy life. I didn't realize that a few years later the meds would not be giving me the same level of confidence, focus, and motivation as they did initially, and now I feel like I sort of wasted the first year or so by not using those benefits to make more permanent lifestyle changes. I relied on the meds to do everything for me, which they did initially, but now they don't and I have a lot of new struggles as a result. The meds still provide a lot of benefit and I'm way better off taking them, but it's one of my biggest regrets, squandering that first year or so where I could do everything so much more effortlessly before developing some sort of baseline tolerance."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Drink lots of water. If you're going to take Caffeine, don't go for more than an 80 ml cup of coffee and choose to take it about half an hour after you took your ritalin. However, I highly recommend you only add coffee to the mix a few months after you've gotten used to the effects of ritalin. 

You may not instantly know how to take advantage of having your symptoms diminished. You may feel some euphoria in the first week of taking it, so don't take it as a ""this is what a neurotypical life is like"" kind of feeling. 

You may get more or less side effects depending on how well you've slept the day you take a pill; for me, sometimes I'll get anxiety, especially when I had a poor night's sleep. When my meds give me anxiety, I do something which I call ""working on my executive functions"": I'll take a task that I've been putting off and I try to do it, experimenting my executive capabilities. It's like trying to find the right muscles to move a body part that you couldn't effectively move before. Doing that will decrease my anxiety by channeling that tension that I get from stimulants into an exercise which very often ends up in crossing out a few overdue tasks.

It may feel weird to get a dopamine kick out of finishing a task as first, so paying attention to how your body responds to it will also help with making the best out of the treatment.

Just remember that pills don't teach skills. Starting treatment with stimulants in your childhood is one thing, but in adulthood you'll have to unlearn and relearn a lot."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Drink plenty of water. Snack as much as you can If you're having a hard time with your appetite. I'd say wait to drive until you know how it's going to affect you. It might make you sleepy. 

I'd avoid alcohol and caffeine especially your first few days."

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"I was told I could have a little coffee but if you have Starbucks for example with much higher caffeine you could have heart palpitations, be shaky, anxious, etc. I had decaf and it seriously hurt my stomach which didn’t happen before meds. Be careful with alcohol but usually one drink when the meds are wearing off has been fine for me. The bottle said the danger is having XR pills release in your system too quickly so by the end of the day I assume the risk is much lower so once you know how the meds affect you it will be safer to judge."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Honestly, take **everyones** advice here with a grain of salt. The effects of adhd medicine vary, and are very individual.

The most important takes I have are:

1. don't be afraid to experiment to find the right dosage and habits that fit you, the only real boundries should be what your doctor prescribes and explains.

2. Try to find the effects of the meds by recognizing long term recurring patterns, and don't jump to impulsive decisions based on single events/effects.

3. The effects of your medication can vary over time (due to lifestyle/age/work/diet/whatever...), so be mindful of changes, and if something's not working anymore, don't fight it, adapt and change your treatment accordingly. 

4. Don't expect it to magically fix all your problems, medicine is a tool, you still need to learn how to use it to improve your quality of life. 


All these answers were already mentioned here before, but I think having them summarized and together makes them easier to understand + digest."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,Eat protein with your morning dose
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Started taking adderal Over 9 months ago. The only thing i wish i had been able to accept sooner is that it’s ok to feel good. I was diagnosed as an adult too, and was concerned I liked adderal too much, because I’ve always had a affinity for drugs, and have done more than I care to remember. So i was afraid to take more than 20mg in a day, and wouldn’t take it unless I “needed” it. 

But the fact is, I always need it. That “too good” feeling i still get every time i take it, is seratonin, and evidently my body doesn’t produce much at all on its own."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Don’t drink alcohol on stimulants. You may be able to handle it fine, but it took years of me learning the hard way that drinking+stimulants= angry/mean drunk and it still haunts me. can’t stress this enough."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"dont ever drink anything with caffine while on meds! 
before i started meds (pretty sure it was ritalin) i was drinking 2 monsters every day as a way to avoid medication (obviously it didnt work.) So when i finally started medication i had drank a monster out of habit and had to get my dad to come get me from work because i was shaking so bad. He told me what i had done was like taking 2 of those pills LOL! never drinking a monster while med testing ever again"
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,If it’s not working don’t be afraid to discuss it with your doctor. Take it everyday or pretty often so that you understand how it’s helping or hindering you.
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Be careful with coffee and caffeine, if you notice significant changes that are not good - pay attention. I had terrible side effects that I didn't know were side effects until we switched my meds. Set a timer to take them around the same time each day. I forget to take them multiple times a week."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"I just started Vyvanse 12 days ago I’m 28F. So far for me I see a huge difference in my impulse control and ability to do tasks at home. I was hoping it would help me with my work issues but so far it has not carried over to my work lol, maybe I just really hate my job though. I wish someone would have told me that it doesn’t last all day, I thought something was really wrong at night or in the evening cause I kept crashing and crying a lot at night lol even vomited the first 2 days but it went away. But apparently as per others this is normal. The one thing I have yet to figure out is what it means when some days my crash happens early (3-4pm) and other days it happens later (8-9pm) when I took the meds at the same time.. If anyone can shed light on that I’d love to hear!"
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Def have someone close to you that knows you’re going on meds and can watch for how your behavior changes. A lot of things for me I didn’t really recognize internally that were really obvious externally. Especially if it’s something like when you forget what you’re doing or get distracted! Having someone say “hey you’ve been really hyper recently” or “you’ve been eating a ton” actually helps a lot.

Hmm if you forget to take it and it’s already like, 2pm just go ahead and cross off that day med wise. The effect of keeping you awake that night is probably worse than missing a day if nothing important is happening btw."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,Something I thought was interesting was how stimulants are said to commonly suppress appetite…what I thought that meant was you just don’t get the feeling of being hungry…but for me sometimes it actually makes me “feel full”. Which to me is a big difference because I can still eat when I’m not hungry…since I like food. But it’s actually really difficult to eat sometimes when I feel full
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"There's a few points you should probably be aware of that I haven't seen mentioned elsewhere in this thread.

1: It can take a very long time to figure out your medication schedule. ADHD meds aren't like other drugs where you get a set dosage calculated based on your sex/weight or whatever, it takes different amounts of each drug to have an affect for each person and you will have to slowly work your way upwards with each drug you try until you find a solution that works.

2: No ADHD medication starts working immediately, no matter what it feels like. It takes months for your body to fully adapt to your medication, so even if the first few months on a new med feel great, don't start thinking your ADHD is cured.

3: The drugs do more than just treat the symptoms if you give them enough time. When you find the right medication schedule for you, if you give it enough time you should continue improving over time without changing your doses. This happens over years though, not months.

The next few months may feel like a disappointment as you try different meds and realise that none of them ""fix"" you, but ADHD is a marathon, no a sprint. Improvement is a slow process that happens over years and relies on more than just pills, but it does happen and it does last. A year or 2 after I was diagnosed and had found a steady med schedule I though I had reached the limit of how far I would ever improve, but 4 years later I look back and realise that I've kept improving the entire time, just not in a way that was obvious."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"That they took a few weeks to work. When I first started concerta I thought it would be an instantaneous thing, but they took about four weeks for me to REALLY see a difference and the first two weeks were full of anxiety. I upped my dosage a couple times after the initial prescription, and each time the anxiety would come back for about four days. If you're on a low dose to start or just end up needing a higher dosage, the initial side effects might come back temporarily, but in my experience it's very much worth it. Also I've learned that you have to time when you're taking them with when you go to sleep. If I take them at 10 a.m. I won't be able to fall asleep until 10 p.m., sometimes 11."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Meds are helpful and amazing but they are not a cure.  You will still have days where you struggle with focus and memory etc.... and that's OK.  Eat lunch every single day, even if you aren't hungry.  

Also it's good policy to never mention that you are prescribed amphetamines.  People will ask to buy/try them.  If you tell a friend or something and they ask you to share your meds, very clearly tell them no.  Even if you're open to sharing, it's incredibly inappropriate to ask and really illegal."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"* Plan out your daily meals! Start with a breakfast that is high in protein, fat and complex carbs. Oatmeal is great. You will most likely have reduced appetite and having a plan makes consuming the food easier. If it  is hard to eat, make a protein shake and add oatmeal flour. Thats my go to. 
* I recommend taking meds every day no matter what. Try and eat something before or just after. Also take meds same time every day. 
* You might feel a crash/comedown when they wear off in the afternoon. This is normal and not dangerous. My tip on countering this is physical exercise. Go for a walk/run or work out. 
* Another thing I highly recommend is educating yourself on ADHD. Learn to know yourself. Identify the areas of your life that are lacking. Notepad and write down. What is dragging you down today, tomorrow next week? 
*  Identify som small measures you can make to improve life. Practice putting keys in same place every day. Over do it. 
* Ritalin might give you euphoria in the beginning, but might also make you feel like shit. Did both for me. This goes away. 
* Look into good sleep habits. Make sure you get a sleep schedule that fits for you. Try and wake up same time every day, and for the love of god make sure you get enough sleep. It is going to make your life so much easier.
* Cold and sweaty hands and feet is normal. But goes away mostly. If you let warm water run down your hands from above the wrists this will warm them. 
* I would use this new start to actually implement some measures to improve life. In the beginning medication might feel like a cheat code, but its not gonna solve your problems. The only thing that can improve your life is you! Make a conscious effort to do better. Implement good habits now, and succeed later! 
* You might need to drink more than previously as you will sweat and use the bathroom more than before. Stay hydrated. 
* Implement a calendar system to your life. The more notifications and alarms you can set for yourself the more organised and in control you will be. Know your limits though. its easy to say yes to everything but when push come to show its to much. 
* In my opinion the most important thing you can do is move! Work out! its stimulates the brain and makes it work so much better. Exercise as ADHD treatment is life changing. Combined with medication its so good. Also you need to realise that this won't fix your life, but can absolutely improve it. Try not to compare to others, but compare with yourself. Look at where you were one year ago compared to in a month... I got diagnosed 8 months ago, but only just realised how far I have come. I have lost allot of weight gained muscle, am more happy, eat healthier, wake up on time allot more often, and I started on my exams the instant the semester started. That is insane. I have gotten so far! But some times I look at my friends and its like, ok masters degree, own apartment, dream job. Fuck I want that. But I had a handicap in untreated ADHD for the first 1/4 of my life. Its catchup time baby. SO start small. Implement small things to your daily routine to make your life better. Mealprep, exercise, diet, habits."

What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Once u start taking stimulants for medication it makes doing stimulants for fun less effective (and less fun), this isn't a thing for me now that I'm in my 40s but in my 20s i found this out 🤣"
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"That after the first 2 weeks of stimulants you will never feel the same way you did then even if you take months off from taking meds, you'll never re-experience that same effect."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Take the time to get used to your meds. It might be that you need to shorten or lengthen the interval between two doses a couple of times. That’s just trial and error. It might be that you take your next dose too fast and feel stressed. Or that you take your next too slow, and end up in a rebound. Don’t give up! You’ll get there!"
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"I took Ritalin for a few months when first diagnosed (at 25). 

It was a low dose. I was advised to avoid caffeine because it could negate the effects or cause serious anxiety - which happened because of course I ignored that advice. Also to avoid drinking alcohol because it could increase liver damage. 

I’d take it when I woke up, shortly after breakfast. It would wear off around noon so at 2pm would take another but only after I talked to my doctor to mention how fast it was wearing off. She mentioned my options could be to increase the dose or keep it low and take twice daily, so I did the latter. 

Eventually after 3 months I brought up how angry it made me - I didn’t have much of a temper before, but since starting Ritalin, I would snap pretty irrationally at my kids. Things that had never made me angry before were suddenly Worst Case Scenarios in my mind and I was constantly, randomly, furious. This was about a month after I’d weaned myself off of coffee or energy drinks (I don’t drink pop or tea anyway so didn’t include those).  I didn’t drink alcohol at all before or during taking Ritalin so it also wasn’t a contributing factor.

Eventually she switched me to Vyvanse which worked beautifully, got rid of the anger, and was longer lasting so I only needed a 20mg pill once daily after breakfast. This isn’t encouraging you to switch, just to be aware of side effects if you or your family notices a big shift in overall attitude (you can feel the positive effects like more focus and balanced energy, but things like sudden moodswings, feeling very angry or very sad out of nowhere, can start to happen simultaneously) and to let you know there are other options if you do notice side effects.

*At some point my doc tried Gabapetin for a week in tandem with Ritalin, I think to help with the anger, but I had an allergic reaction so was taken off it immediately (bright red rash from my neck that was spreading across my chest). 

Read the pamphlets the pharmacy gives you with the medication. It’ll list other side effects or possible allergic reactions to look out for. 

Good luck :)"
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"I'm not on meds yet but I know a ton of people who are, but before I share my second hand anecdotes its worth noting that exactly how you'll respond to things will be unique to you, as every human body differs in its metabolism and response to drugs, and it will probably take a bit of experimenting (and possible dosage/med changes) to figure out exactly what works best for you.  


One thing I seem to have noticed from my friends who are medicated (all started meds in their 20s or 30s) is that its better to measure the effects in terms of external factors (doing better at work, not forgetting that one thing you always forget, etc) than internal factors (how you feel etc)"
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,Avoid caffeine to start with. You will crash around 3 hour mark on short acting. It isn't fun. Be aware so you can avoid overreacting. Doing multiple short acting doses is like a roller coaster. Your initial dose level might not do much for you. Your brain goes quiet. Apparently this is what normal is! Put alarms on your phone to remind you to take your dose. Snooze the alarm if you can't take it right away or you will forget. You will be able to start routines like flossing every day! Drink water!
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"A lot of people have left some great advice! Your medical provider may/may not ask you to take one-two days off your meds a week, but beware that even if you’re not “addicted” to your meds, your body will become physically dependent on them so you may experience withdrawal symptoms if you suddenly don’t take them for a day.

Also, I’ve seen a lot of people on this sub say they’ve had their medication stolen by friends, family, and/or roommates so be sure to keep yours in a secure location!

A common trick a lot of people use is to take maybe half your dose around 30 minutes to an hour before you need to wake up. It makes getting out of bed so much easier.

The last thing I’ll mention is to expect some negative side effects in the beginning. Your body is getting adjusted to a completely new medication and that takes some time. I remember having a lot of headaches (from jaw clenching), getting dehydrated easily, experiencing appetite loss, emotional blunting, and sometimes feeling overly jittery. I also did experience acid reflux in the beginning which can apparently be linked to stimulants but it went away. All of these negative side effects subsided for me after the first two months, and it’s worth taking a lower dose or speaking to your doctor if the negative side effects become too unbearable. 

Oh and last but not least, you’ll want to take better care of your teeth since stimulants give you dry mouth (making it easier for your teeth to decay faster). Make sure to have some sort of mouthwash, chew on sugar-free gum, and brush your teeth as regularly and thoroughly as you can. It also doesn’t hurt to go to the dentist every once in a while!"

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"I wish I was told about the crash effect, especially if you don't eat enough. I know people who would cry at the same time every day, and it took her a while to realize she was 'crashing' from the medication. And that even if the same dose is working 'as well' I might never feel as good as the first few days I was started on medication.

Also that methylphenidate ER and brand name Concerta (OROS) are NOT the same thing!"
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"When I started on Ritalin, I learned quickly that coffee was not my friend at first. But weirdly overtime, I was able to drink a bit each morning a couple hours before I’d start my meds. 

It took a while for the dosage to “sink in” so to speak. First I had to get over coffee, then I was getting this tight feeling in my chest and felt anxious (which was amplified to 11 by coffee). But then suddenly the anxiety and tightness stopped and I started to feel really great. Now I just feel balanced when I take it. 

So I will say, don’t expect it to be like turning on a light switch. It’s a process of finding the right dosage and making sure the drug itself is doing you a service period. Trust the process, listen to your doctor, and let the first couple months be apart of slowly figuring it all out. Don’t drink coffee, at least at first."

It feels at first like a cure all, but it isn’t. You’ll have to learn how it affects you and when to take it. I notice when I give myself med holidays I don’t do much those days; but the days I take it I’m usually productive to my own standard."

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"I started vyvanse a week ago. I wasn’t sure what to expect but for me so far I’m pleasantly surprised. 

I did have an “ah-ha” moment. More of like a “holy shit I am actually capable of completing all of these tasks I need to do today”
My head is a lot more quiet - I’m no longer having 5 conversations with myself at once, my anxiety is surprisingly reduced as well. 
Only side effects as of now are *serious* dry mouth. Like drier than the desert. But it does make me drink a shit ton of water - so make sure you keep hydrated throughout the day. 
Another side effect is no appetite at all. I’ve lost 6lbs in a week alone. But I need to lose 30lbs anyway so it’s not a huge deal. So make sure you eat. I eat a hearty meal when my meds wear off and I get my appetite back. 
I’m noticing on the days I do take my medications (I’m not doing it everyday) I’m actually sleeping through the night and sleeping better than my unmedicated days. 

I tried drinking caffeine one day while on my meds and my heart rate went up to 130s for a few hours. Bad idea. So I cut out caffeine on my med days. But my meds actually keep me more awake than caffeine. 

I also have been keeping track of my blood pressure. Stimulants can raise your blood pressure. But I also have severe health anxiety lol"

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"I've been on Adderall for over a month now. My advice based on my experience is to stay hydrated and to not be surprised if your energy levels are lower at first. This was the case with me for about 2 weeks but things improved. Also, notice if your appetite is diminished and if this is an issue for you. 

I feel generally more calm and it is easier for me to stay focused. My thoughts don't hop around like they do without meds. Being on stimulants has been a game changer."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,I felt extremely thirsty and had a hard time eating which caused that sick hungry feeling. So I now keep snacks qne things easy to make that I love to eat on hand since it was hard for me to really cook if I wasn't hungry. No issues with coffee or alcohol other than I am no longer drinking 1 or 2 pots of coffee a day.
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"How you feel when you first start taking it is not how you will feel after a few months taking it. Really important that you take care of your body both because stimulants can be a little taxing and also because it will help the effectiveness of the medication. Make sure you’re eating (and eating well), exercising, and getting a lot of sleep and the medication will be more effective. 

It can be easy to feel like the medication is doing the work for you but there’s a lot of self-care/maintenance that can get lost because of how much more you feel like you’re able to do with meds, make sure you keep your body healthy!

Also the dose/beans you start off with might not always be right for you. Make sure you take some notes about how it makes you feel the first few months and be communicative to your doctor about any side effects, positives, negatives, etc."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"If you have any nicotine habit, kick it now. It’s really hard to stop once you’re on meds."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"How it effects everyone is different, plus what med in particular….most importantly the difference between IR and extended. Extended, don’t be surprised if you don’t feel terribly different right away. Those tend to need a little time to build in your system for maximum efficiency. IR, tend to be like they say….you’ll have at least some sort of jolt of dopamine, especially when first taking them before your body adjusts

1. Especially if it’s IR, the jolt of initial dopamine after taking meds doesn’t last forever. For some, that’s good as it can make them feel weird, for others it’s negative as they feel that short burst of dopamine is the way meds should feel all the time….which isn’t true. It’s a side effect, not the main function. When that wears off, as eventually it will, it doesn’t mean you keep upping doses just to chase that fleeting feeling. Discuss dosage with your doctor only based off of overall quality of life/your ability to function. 

2. Drink TONS of water. However much you drink now, way more than that. Water helps the meds break down more proportionately, keeps you hydrated as adhd meds are super dehydrating, and combating dehydration will help you with a smoother come down off your meds, less headaches, and less fatigue. Sometimes the brain misinterprets dehydration for fatigue. Trust me on this one

3. Keep your meds in a safe place. Someone can be sorry as they come, but sorry doesn’t replace life altering meds. If you’re already in a safe environment around trusted individuals, that’s fine. But if not, lock box, my friend. 

4. Don’t take them too late. If you forget half way through the day or don’t wake up until super late, don’t bother. It’ll completely throw off your sleep-wake cycle, and being tired/not getting enough sleep or getting crappy sleep will absolutely affect how your meds work. I also suggest opting out of meds if you’re sick. No point. Your body recovers faster with rest, which essentially is the opposite of what a stimulant does. 

5. I don’t drink alcohol or caffeine, which is more a personal choice than anything else, but if you struggle with anxiety or depression, these things with meds is going to make things worse. What comes up must come down, as Newton would say. Stack more stimulant on stimulant with caffeine, you will have a lot of energy and then crash quicker and harder than ever. If you struggle with anxiety, alcohol relaxes and then the anxiety comes back with aggression (plus, making a lot more work for your liver). Stimulants intensify these things. To each his own, and I don’t see occasional use of either as fatal by any means, but for me it’s just not worth the discomfort either way it goes. Also, you’ll function way better on your meds consistently without adding these things

6. Working out is another cheat move I use like water to help with keeping good energy levels throughout the day. I actually like working out hours after I’ve taken my meds because it not only gives a little energy boost and endorphins give a nice dopamine boost, but also it helps me sleep a lot better at night. Oh, I mean, plus it’s good for your body in general. I’m not talking out working out excessively, just a half hour to an hour a day will help tons. See what works for you as far as timing of all that goes

7. Force yourself out of bed after taking meds and start doing something, anything. It’ll really help you get going with the day, because meds don’t actually *make* you productive, they allow you the ability to be productive once you start doing something. Just the motion of getting out of bed and taking a shower, tidying the room, doing some dishes, making breakfast, etc. will help set the tone of the day. Meanwhile, if you start by laying in bed for hours or scrolling social media……then….you know😅 you can become the most effective bed-layer/mindless scroller ever. All day."

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"If you formerly used caffeine as a 'substitute' self-medication, like a cup or two in the morning, a red bull after lunch, etc, then be sure not to do that while you're on meds. Just drink a lot of water, use lip balm to prevent chapped, dry lips, and be sure to eat nutritious foods. You may not feel hungry at first when you start meds, but please make yourself eat something. I suggest nutritious foods since you will probably be consuming less food at first until you get used to the meds, so make each bite count. I would suggest abstaining from alcohol, weed, etc until you are on the medication for several weeks and feel comfortable with how it affects you.

Also, talk to your doctor about this! They know you better than we do, and they can give you medical advice."

If you're sleep deprived, stimulants don't work as well and can even make you feel sleepier. Get at least 7 hours of sleep, and try to stick to a scheduled (says the guy who's up at 4).

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"I was in the same boat a few weeks ago, also in FR. Did you get prescribed the slow release ones? Was the diagnosis easy to get, and did you have to take a test? My partner looked for an English speaking psychiatrist but the one she found recommended she takes the full battery of tests in her native language. 

The first few days I was really surprised how much I could get done, as if I could suddenly concentrate on things without having to sift through a hundred thoughts in my head. Over time the effects got less noticeable, or I got used to them. I still do notice a marked increase in quality of life and a decrease in worrying and anxiety. 

The doctor didn't tell me anything regarding what to avoid, I'm not drinking any alcohol because according to what I read it can cause bad side effects. I found out the hard way that coffee was making me very hyper and causing me to crash fast, so I cut that out too. What works best for me is to have the pills with a large breakfast so they release slower. I've only taken Ritalin on workdays so far, but I think I'll take it this weekend too just to see how I feel. 

What I would recommend is to read up on ADHD alongside medication. I found a few good videos by doctors and people with ADHD, and am currently reading Fast Minds by Craig Surman and Tim Bilkey. It's really great and helping me put things into perspective."

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"The best thing I ever did for myself when I started meds was use a Google home to set up reminders thought out the day- time to eat, have you stretched, go walk outside, you're doing great, etc. It allows me to hyper focus on work but also because it's something talking to me that I don't have to prompt, it helps me break out of that cycle and remember to take care of human things. This is especially great if you have animals, as you can get it to remind you of that as well. 

I keep a snack drawer of ""fun"" things that are good for the diet so I don't have to leave what I'm doing unless I want to, that also helps. I take magnesium right now due to feeling flighty on the meds sometimes. For some reason it helps, I just cannot remember why. 

Drinking water is super important, so is eating (as stated previously by other beautiful humans). I also find that sometimes I cramp more now than I did before but I think it's due to water intake. This is also a great time to start bullet journaling if you've been thinking about it, cause that shit has kept me sane on more than one occasion due to out of site out of mind- have it sit near you or get one of the wallets with the fillable mini notebook attached.

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Eat. Eat regularly, properly, and consistently. 

I had an awful 3 months trying to make stimulants work and failed miserably largely due to not eating enough. I didn’t realize this until months later after I had given up on stimulants completely. I wish someone had talked to me about what constitutes proper eating and how these meds do not work well without food. I have a history of eating disorders so you would have thought that this should have been a point of discussion, but no one mentioned food at all."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"-if you start feeling uneasy and jittery— eat/drink. 

-if you start getting irritable or angry for no reason, or anxious— eat/drink.

-if you regularly drink coffee, start out in moderation. if you don’t, maybe drink a cup after it’s past it’s peak. I’ve accidentally made myself really jittery and lightheaded from drinking too much caffeine after taking my meds. (I’m on methylphenidate but sold as concerta which I think is still just Ritalin?) 

-the first few weeks *can* go really great, but don’t get discouraged if it’s a rough start. it took a handful of months for me and my doctor to dial in the right dosage and when to take it. I definitely would still make the same choice, looking back. every human’s body is different"

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"If you're a coffee/energy drink person, switch to tea or cut caffeine entirely. It took me way too long to accept this and I nearly burned myself out. 

Make yourself eat, either by setting meal times or eating healthy snacks throughout the day. Your appetite is going to TANK for about a month. Mine leveled off eventually, but it took some effort. You gotta drink water too, and plenty of it.

Keep an eye on your mood. Adderall made me irritable for a while and I didn't notice. It was pointed out to me and once I was aware, it was much easier to keep in check.

Lastly, though stimulants are incredibly helpful, they're not magic. You'll still have to work on your symptoms and learn new habits. It still takes effort and things are going to change. Somethings are going to be infinitely easier, but other things are going to be harder. Making conversation is much easier for me now, but I can't hyperfocus my way through a 14 hour shift anymore.

Bonus: forgive yourself and your family. Meds opened my eyes to how things should have been for the first 20+ years of my life and I was so angry at all my missed opportunities and failures that stemmed from untreated ADHD. It's okay, you're seeking treatment now. You can't do better until you know better. Good luck with it!"
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"I was careful to look into things extensively before I started. But these are some things that stood out to me:

You won’t need as much caffeine as you used to. 

You need to drink more water because the meds will dehydrate you. 

The euphoric feeling you might get the first few times won’t last. Don’t chase that feeling.

A protein rich breakfast will help your meds to work more effectively. Fatty or carb rich diets may mean you need more meds to get the same effect.

Avoid Vitamin C and ascorbic acid for an hour before and after you take your meds. They can attach to the medication and make them pass through your system without being absorbed."

Just want to highlight those who have said anything regarding any euphoric leaning side effects. Use this to your advantage! Perhaps to set routines or to begin troubleshooting long-term exec function struggles, etc. Just be aware the *feeling like you could conquer the world* symptom won’t last forever. So be mindful, especially if it creates temptation to start a new hobby you’d never considered before or otherworldly hyper-fixations. 

One of the best pieces of advice (maybe someone here has already said it) I’ve received from this sub is: If you find yourself taking a stimulant and directing your focus towards something unintentional/leisurely, when you have better things to do, create 5 item list of what you’re going to do before medicating in the AM to just keep you on track. Needs to be in sight for me, for others it needs to be on their phone or have a reminder tied to it! Whatever works for you is fantastic! 

So happy for you!! A diagnosis is an answer, and man, that was more than I thought I would ever get, for the longest time. 

I’m F22–I failed three consecutive semesters of college (with a dual anxiety/depression diagnosis for 5 years prior) before I received an ADHD diagnosis! I’ve been taking adderall + ADHD coaching for 3 years now. Such a relief! I hope any existing feelings of self doubt will start to subside for you the way they have for me. You are functional, talented, smart, and most importantly, you’re much much more than your ADHD! 

In this new reality, the surfacing deficits might become overwhelming. Just don’t forget to reassure yourself you’ve faced these challenges thousands of times without a complete or clear-cut understanding before. You’ve made it this far, now you might just need to troubleshoot using that *answer*! ;) Best of luck to you!"

I hope it works for you 💕 I've been taking adderall for my adhd for about 7 years (im now on 25mg xr and 5mg ir as needed) so it may be different for ritalin, but a side effect I didn't expect that may happen with Ritalin is sweating. I'm already a sweaty person but sometimes with adderall especially if I combine it with caffeine I'll just be sitting in a chair sweating lol also im likely to sweat more if I do some kind of activity like walking or yoga or something... just something to look out for! idk if anyone else experiences this! but probably all the more reason to drink water!"
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Use a side effects/symptom management template from Google to track how you react to meds! It really helps to be able to look back and see how you've been adjusting and to isolate any issues. 

Take a break from caffeine, at least whilst you're adjusting to your meds. 

Expect some mood changes. When I started my meds, for a few days I got a slight euphoric feeling. I also experienced afternoon crashes and would get quite grumpy/irritable. It'll all even out as your brain/body settles (if it doesn't talk to your Dr) 

Eat & drink plenty of water. It can be really hard to eat on meds but it's so so important. Make sure to eat a nutritious breakfast before taking your medication and if lunch is hard try meal replacement drinks. If you forget to drink, get something like Dioralyte to replenish your electrolytes. 

Lastly, it can take a while to find medication that works for you. It took me over a year and I tried 4 different types and a couple different combinations of meds until I found what worked best for me. It can be quite frustrating and feel like nothing will ever work but you'll get there!

And mental health affects how they work a lot more than you might think (in my experience).

It's still working, but I'm having to put in more effort to make it work. So yeah, if things seem wrong or less effective, just assess where you are mentally."

I later asked my psychiatrist and she said it’s not supposed to interact. just something to beware.

personally, even on the instant release version, the appetite suppression that others mentioned lasts all day for me. I won’t eat very much all day. just something to keep in mind.

A fellow ADHD-friend immediately recognized it and advised me to take no meds whilst hormones go crazy..

In  my case it hit me that hard i decided that it was best for everyone for me to stay in my room. Alone lol.
Good luck dosing and finding out what the meds do for you!"
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Not Ritalin; Adderall, then Dexedrine in my case.

Switch off caffeine to start and then slowly reintegrate it into your life if you want. I still drink coffee, but I can handle less than I did before.

I never had any negative mental side effects (though *rarely* I'll feel extra short tempered); it's the physical side effects that bothered me more. It was more so when beginning or upping the dose, but I'd feel like a spring wound too tight. Not what I would call amped or jittery, but tense. Caffeine still makes that worse. *Rarely* I'd also get **the worst** headaches as it's wearing off.

I'll also say in my case it took me a while to take my medication seriously. Even after getting diagnosed I still had doubts and worried about turning into a tweaker or something on the medication. After a long time, I've finally come to terms with my diagnosis, and I've never felt a ""need"" to take my medicine from an addiction standpoint. That is to say, I take it daily because I need it, but if I miss doses I don't get ""cravings"" or anything like that."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"It's more something that I was told before starting.

It won't fix everything. Itll make it harder to switch focus and attend to things. But it's not a magic bullet. 

It may increase your anxiety and physical symptoms of anxiety at the start but it'll settle. Will also take time to adjust to get right.

It is an ah-hah moment where you realise how easy it is for people without ADHD to just get stuff done. But that subsides and becomes harder again after the initial euphoria effect stops happening. 

You still need to work at the difficulties of ADHD. It wont fix your executive functioning, including memory stuff, focus issues (though it does help), needing to be interested in a thing to really be invested, planning, etc. It helps with those, and definitely helps to work through them, but it wont fix it."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Eat first! Set timers to snack through out the day, get some easy grab snacks. 

Give it time to adjust. Best case go 3 months (unless there’s significant side effects then cal your doc). 

Set timers to take it on schedule as best you can.  

Create a system to remember if you’ve taken it. 
 - checking a list beside the pills. 
- telling someone
- getting a timer cap

I hope it helps you :)"
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"EAT. Look at it as a task. Even if you're not hungry, try to realistically look at what you've eaten and make sure you eat enough.

P.s. on eating - watch what you eat, and when you eat it. I don't eat at all 2 hours before and 1 hour after taking meds, although sometimes I cheat and have coffee 30-45 minutes later.

SLEEP. Stimulants care whether or not you sleep enough. My magic number is at least 7 hours. Meds will have a dulled effect or none at all if you didn't sleep well enough. If you're OK with sleep aids, I highly recommend ZzzQuil ULTRA or generic. You may feel more groggy for an hour or so, but you will not wake up in the middle of the night and will be better rested. Regular zzzquil and melatonin do not work for me.

Dose timing - I'm on adderall XR, which I know can reliably last me 8-10 hours. I try to take my dose so it will wear off about an hour after I will need it latest. So even if I wake up at 8 am, if I'm gonna need it at 7pm, I'll wait until 11 to take it. You'll have to feel that one out, and you'll get what I mean. 

Alcohol - I used to like to drink a lot, but throttled down my drinking severely before I was prescribed. I would have 3 or 4 drinks once a week. Since starting meds, I have absolutely no interest in alcohol at all. It's okay to drink IN MODERATION while the meds are not affecting you, but dont be surprised if you lose interest entirely.

Side effects - All I had when I first started was muscle cramps. A quick Google search will give you a couple of supplements that are beneficial to take, especially if you have muscle tension or cramping. I personally take Magnesium, L-Theanine, Zinc (with vitamin c), and Vitamin D every night before bed. I also eat 2-3 bananas with breakfast for a potassium boost."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Drink a lot of water and be mindful of teeth grinding. Be careful of your caffeine intake. Most of all, talk with whomever is prescribing it in case it isn't working or if you have any questions/issues."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Spend significant time (and therapy) learning the difference between people who fail to help, people who don't care, and people who are actively malicious. When you lash out at someone while in stimulants, you might ask yourself if it was you or the meds making you angry.

Sometimes, it is the meds and you need to make amends. Sometimes, your response is entirely justified and even necessary.

This might be less important for women, since they're already accustomed to hormonal changes seriously impacting their mood. For guys like me, this is essential, especially given our socialized lack of introspection. The anger hit me like a ton of bricks, and the hardest part was learning that I needed to let that anger out sometimes. I spent years suppressing all of the anger and letting people walk all over me. I just didn't want to do something I regretted, but that was the mistake."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,Stimulants raise histamine levels. Those with histamine intolerance or MCAS might not tolerate them well and may actually cause paradoxical effects like brain fog.

Seriously. It works so much better."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"It may take a few days to feel calm on it. You’re literally taking a stimulant and for me the first 3 days had me thinking that I wasn’t ADHD after all. Day 4 the calm set in.

Drink more water than usual. If you get a headache drink half a litre of water and see if it goes away. This could also be the reason alcohol doesn’t suit many people on medication? Not sure if it’s that or simply the body trying to deal with a stimulant and a downer at the same time. 

Eat healthy foods. You may lose your appetite but know that you will eat at X time and then just make something, anything, at that time and eat. 

Personally I try and take holidays every weekend or any day I don’t have anything very pressing to tend to. I have lost a lot of faith in my own capabilities but taking a day or two off really reminds me that I actually like me and it’s okay. Some people rely more heavily on medication than others. There may always be issues with getting meds for one reason or another. I like to keep a few days where I can remember that I can handle it without. 

Watch the anxiety. I feel if I don’t manage my schedule well while on medication I feel far more on edge than a day where I am not taking any.

You still need to plan things and get organised it’s just a lot easier to do so. I prefer to do this in the evening before as I’m less likely to be able to see what needs to be done in the mornings.

Exercise and do all the other healthy things. You’re body and mind need looking after even though you have help now.

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Brief scan and not seeing this here, and I hope you see it and read it a few times though I admit I'm not the best wordsmith or messenger. 

Meds will NOT give you new habits and work like magic, though they will feel that way initially. I wish I understood this when I was younger and without much of any support. 

Meds will make it easier to do many things and at the start it may feel euphoric. Please please please, use that time to build the habits you may not have been able to do so previously. Or else you'll revert back to old routines but in a more focused way. Use planners, to do lists, study guides, take notes, use timers and visual reminders (either for work, class, hobbies, or personal life). Find what works for you and build your toolbox!

Otherwise you will get sucked into doing whatever you're doing, lose track of time very easily and the meds just won't increase your efficacy without direction and control from yourself and that takes habits. 

Side note (and sad note): YMMV but I doubt I'm the only one who's experienced a lot of judgement, condescension and BS from people both due to the diagnosis and due to the meds. I hope it goes better for you than it has for me in that regard. It can come from family, friends, coworkers... and it just sucks. Don't be too overt about your meds, but keeping it secret may get you judged as well (""secret druggie"" label or whatever).

Also: refill laws vary depending on locale. Where I live, I can't do mail order because I have to be present at the random moment it appears so I can sign. I also have to wait until 30 days after filling to get a new prescription. So if you can't get to the pharmacy due to life, you're SOL. For this reason, I dial down my dose a bit when I can (weekends or vacation) so that I always know I have some extra to get through a few more days of work/life.

The rest of the comments look like they're covering sleep/food and the other really important basics. It's a big change, but it's a big help. I wish you the best!"

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,Use the lowest dose that works for you and stick to it. Don't take more than the prescription says to. Even if you feel nothing. That initial euphoria some people get is an indication that the dose was too high to begin with. It shouldn't always give you that feeling. Alot of people chase that and get into trouble. Also remember to eat and drink
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"One of the things my therapist had me do when I was starting meds and change doses is track my times taken, mood, side effects, sleep patterns, appetite, etc. I had a sheet with a pen right next to my bed that I filled out at the end of each day. It really helped me to decide if my meds were working for me or not because I never experienced that “ah ha” moment.

Also Ritalin gave me the worst headaches of my life the 5 days I took it and I know tons of adults that it’s done the same just as a heads up."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"
PA Student here! I just finished up a psych rotation and I also have ADHD myself (diagnosed at 21).

1. You’ll feel kind of “intense” at first. This will eventually wear off as you get used to it. The same thing applies to the side effects. Overtime, you’ll develop tolerance. 

2. You have to slowly increase the dose until you find the right dose for your body. Start low and go slow! Some people have super fast or super slow drug metabolisms. 

3. Sometimes people have to try multiple stimulants or even non-stimulants until you find one that works well with your unique brain chemistry. If Ritalin doesn’t jive with your system, let your doctor know so it can be changed. 

4. Refilling a controlled substance is a giant pain in the ass. Do not lose your bottle and hide it from others. You are not allowed to refill early (CVS and Walgreens allowed you to refill on the 28th day). I usually take a small bottle with the pills I need for the day and leave the rest in a secure place at home. 

5. Don’t forget to eat and drink. Allegedly, adults have less appetite suppression, but it’s still important to stay hydrated and keep your blood sugar up since this also affect concentration.

6. Don’t take meds with acidic foods/beverages- especially ones that contain high amounts of vitamin C (acidic)

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?," I'm on 15mg amphetamine salts (Adderall) ((XR specifically)) and entering my third week.


- DRINK. WATER. Get some flavor additives if you struggle. Once you feel your kidneys start to hurt, you're already dehydrated. 


- Pack snacks you enjoy and eat them regardless if you're hungry or not. Your body needs to eat.


- Soda personally became a no for me. It raises my heart rate to about 125 beats per minute and I feel gross and heavy. I think that's different for everyone, but it was something I wasn't prepared for.


- I keep my meds on my person at all times. I try not to delay a dose if I can help it. I take it once I'm settled in at work and have a snack beforehand.


- The headaches!! I missed my first dose this weekend and had a headache that I couldn't sleep off until it hit me that I missed my pill. Today, I'm fine and took it on time.


- Yea, the anger is real. I flunked out of college at 18 and went through addiction searching for something that could help me function. I tried cannabis, cocaine, and nicotine. Now as a 23 year old, it's almost hard to not imagine the ""what if I was diagnosed earlier"". I'm excelling at work. I can sit and focus and accomplish a task. I have energy to push through cleaning and my executive dysfunction is easier to manage. My mind is quiet and the unseen barriers feel manageable.


Honestly, it's been life changing so far and nice to have that boost to get me to function where I need and want to be. I'm a better parent, a better wife, and just more well-rounded in general. Congrats on getting diagnosed!!"

In my experience, Ritalin kills your appetite like nothing else. You know how when you’re not hungry but if someone put a pizza in front of you, you could still have slice? Yeah, with Ritalin is doesn’t matter if you know your body is starving and you need to eat, you just can’t do it. Eat before you take your meds, every time.

I take 3 doses a day, they take 30 mins to kick in and last 4 hours. So in the morning, I have a high protein breakfast, take my meds and then I have half an hour of ‘treat time’ to scroll or do whatever while they kick in. For the rest of the day, I eat like a toddler. Literally, my diet consists of chopped fruit and vege that I nibble at, babybel cheeses, and rice crackers. Something is better than nothing.

My 2 cents : Get you life together whilst you are at 120%. Form new habits. Learn a new skill. Do the things you could not do, and do a lot of them.
Eventually, you will adapt to the meds and not feel like you did at the start, so make use of it.
My only regret is not doing so myself.

Also, you may realise things you did not see before. For me, it was how I was being taken advantage of.

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"The initial effects can vary quite greatly for everyone, you could very well have an a-ha moment or feel not much at all, Ideally the effects are supposed to be subtle and not that noticeable but often there is a ""honeymoon"" period when you first start the meds where the effect does feel very noticeably beneficial and positive.

The one thing I wish I knew when I started taking them is how very subtle yet at the same time incredibly impactful the effect is. A lot of people(including myself) at first don't notice those subtle effects and end up thinking that the meds are lasting too short or whatnot. It shouldn't directly outright increase your motivation, that's what euphoria does; what it should do is improve various aspects of your cognition such as focus, attention, etc and because of this you should naturally develop motivation on your own.

&nbsp;

What happens many times is that you notice the more blatant euphoric honeymoon-related effects and said effects distract you from the more subtle therapeutic ones, often when you end up crashing early from the euphoria it might seem as if the meds aren't lasting long enough leading you to try increasing them or taking longer formulations, this will only make them feel shorter though as the stronger effects from a higher dose will only make the usually gradual decline once the meds hit peak levels in your body more and more noticeable.

The same sort of thing happened with my sister as well, she was diagnosed after me and I could tell the meds had an effect on her from my experience with them, though she claimed she couldn't really feel them do anything, eventually she kept trying different dosages and formulations and found something that worked, but it caused her to get emotional and have other adverse effects because it was too high of a dose.

&nbsp;

All this being said, don't be alarmed and terribly anxious over experiencing any of this, it's a natural part of the meds which I'd wager most people deal with, just make sure to take it slow and give yourself time to truly understand how it affects you before trying to change things up too much."

I'm not saying they are wrong and their experience is invalid, but it wasn't my experience. I certainly felt something but being productive still took A LOT of effort. It's hard to unlearn 20 years of bad habits

One thing is you'll probably have a loss of appetite. Another thing is you might have trouble sleeping so take your pills as early as you can in morning."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"If stimulants help you focus on work/school/chores better but you still struggle socially, or expressing emotions becomes harder for you, please talk to your doctor. Sometimes, ADHD “covers up” autism and when treated for ADHD, the autism becomes more obvious."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"To sum it up 
• only slightly better at remembering shit
•concerningly not hungry (to other people you feel fine)
•wanting to organize stuff??? Mabye just me lol
•get deja vu for no reason at random"
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"It's going to take a while before your body and mind adjust to the symptoms and feeling. So you may behave a bit strangely at first or feel intense emotions like anger, but you should adjust. Your stomach might hurt when the medicine takes effect, this is normal. Your appetite will decrease and your heart rate will be faster, this is all normal. Please ensure that you drink a lot of water and eat regularly, your medicine will work better if you do."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"It took a few months for me to normalize.  I felt charged up for a while which was not the effect I was looking for.  I take a low dose and do not ‘feel’ anything when I take my daily dose but it reduces impulsiveness and helps with focus.

I worry about the long game and becoming tolerant to adderall.  They started me at 20mg and reduced my dose and am now I’m at 10mg. 

Also had an interaction with Prozac which I’m still working through.  They all deal with dopamine so it can interact with antidepressants in a weird way."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Stay hydrated. Stay well fed.

The first day is NOT how you are going to feel forever. That feeling settled down over time.

Your sleep pattern will likely be disrupted when you change meds/dosage.

You may have serious mood swings. That's normal, your brain is reworking itself, you'll be okay. Just know that no, people aren't suddenly more annoying, you aren't an angry person, and no you aren't suddenly super depressed. Your brain is going to swing between extremes as it tries to pinpoint the perfect balance.

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE USE A PILL ORGANISER. Too many people miss doses, double dose and other ADHD prone mistakes. Use an organiser so you can always be sure when you have and havent taken meds.

Getting the dosage right can take months, and being on too high/low dose can leave your symptoms worse, or increase anxiety/depression symptoms. This is normal. You've started the journey and it will be amazing for you when its all sorted"
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,Read up on grief. You'll basically go through the Kubler-Ross stages.
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Like many have said already, resentment/anger at those that did not treat your diagnosis seriously. My anger is at the nurse practitioner that treated me for 6-7 years with crappy anti-depressants because he refused to prescribed a stimulant. I actually got worse b/c of it. All the signs were there as well. Other than that, realize it might take a month or so for your body to adjust to the stimulant, make sure you eat something before taking it. There are very little side effects with stimulants compared to others meds IMO. Definitely limit coffee to one cup only and never drink alcohol if at all possible, it'll only hurt you,  not help"
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,It can take some time to get the right dose.
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,takes awhile for side effects to go away. stick with it for a month and if u still haven’t unbearable side effects switch meds. i had really bad anxiety when i first started. for like weeks. but push through. u might need your dose titrated up or down. it goes away in most cases.
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"People are talking about crashes, but this is pretty unique to Ritalin (Hence the second dose). If you find that the crash is hard to deal with, you may consider using alternatives to Ritalin (with the same compound: methylphenidate) such as Concerta (10-12h I believe so no midday crash). I personally take Biphentin, same compound, about 8-10 hours. My doc reccomended me that one for the longer release.

Vyvanse is also a great one but is a different coumpound, same as Adderall, dexamfetamine.

Both compounds are great, my gf is on Vyvanse and it changed her life as much as Biphentin did for me."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,Lol what do I PERSONALLY wish I was told before starting stimulants? “You’re also bipolar and this is going to ruin 14 years of your life and eventually send you to the psychiatric hospital” not to like… scare you. That’s just my story 🤷🏻‍♀️
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"I get quite a bit more bored and annoyed now, i don’t constantly feel like i solely have to make everyone feel good. i feel more at peace but that also makes me a bit more unsocial since i’m not constantly trying to make people love me"
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"I have a few.

1. Don't mix them with coffee. If you drink coffee, give it an hour or two before you take your meds- otherwise it can really spike up your anxiety. I have PTSD & OCD- so this advice is golden for me.
2. Try to take ritalin AT LEAST 8 hours before you plan to sleep, othrwise it will really mess with your sleeping schedule.
3. First times you take ritalin, it can make you really chatty. It's a normal side effect.
4. Side effects for me have been thirst, wanting to pee a lot, hot flashes, and headaches- But this happened more as I aged. It's easy to circumvent these side effects once your body get used to them.
5. Avoid other stimulants if you can- Especially in the 4 hour window ADHD is active. Though, this also applies to depressants. You can drink alcohol, just not during the window of time ritalin is active.
6. Ritalin crashes are a real thing- You may feel tired/sleepy /mentally exhausted after the ""effects"" have worn off, so use your time wisely.  


EDIT: Forgot to add, ritalin can absolutely kill your appetite, so don't take it before meals."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,The way you feel the next two weeks doesn’t have much to do with how you’ll feel once your body gets used to the drugs.

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,How’s it going so far? I took my first dose yesterday but i have a cold so I just felt horrible and weird afterwards. Im hoping It works for me. 🥲
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,I've never heard vitamin c affecting the efficacy of Adderall. I've definitely taken high doses of vitamin c and my Adderall at the same time without any noticeable change in effect. I wonder what's behind the difference in our experience.
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,I’m starting Ritalin tomorrow and freaking out a little but also excited. I’m in my mid 50’s and don’t want to have the realization that my life could have been a lot different. I guess we’ll see what happens….
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"TLDR; I got lonley and still fall into extreme sadness for my past self. I always knew I wasn’t “bad” 

I self destructed and for the first time in my life felt “lonley” despite being preferably alone 90% of the time. If I get stuck in a negative thought loop I could break out via distractions relatively easy. I’m also a generally happy person, but a space cadet. The quietness for me was deafening which was a problem because I spend most of my time in silence. I wish I’d of been told the world isn’t actually that loud. 
The anger of what could have been.. I still resist my medication because I’m terrified of becoming addicted. My past has been a bit rocky but I’ve never had issues putting substances down before it got too serious. But now I am far less impulsive. Oddly “free drugs” has been more of an offering than I expected 😅 I am less caught up in the fast lane and lost the desire to have the best night ever anytime the option arises. Aside from anything illegal I’ve always been an adrenaline junkie and impulsiveness has sent me to the hospital countless times and I died 3x and had to be brought back online. Now I’m pretty straight edge, it’s so fucking weird knowing my reputation. I’ll still have a couple drinks with friends but it’s just not a part of my identity anymore to need to mentally escape. Now I’ll just go home early lol. So the frustrating part.. I’m so tied up on addiction and fear of my prescription yet I’ve never been addicted to anything despite ongoing use. I don’t care to drink when I’ve constantly been accused of alcoholism. So I wonder had I have been medicated, would all those terrible things have happened 😞 but I’m here now, and that’s pretty dope."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,Still try to do tasks without them. I thought I wasn't good enough unless I was on stimulants. They're meant to help you function until you find good coping mechanisms for yourself.
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,You may shit your pants during your first month but once you get used to it you’ll be good and we’ll adjusted socially better more productive overall
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,To start them sooner.
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,Extended use can cause episodes not too dissimilar to psychotic breaks. Been medicated 15 years and learned it the hard way
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"that if you just keep increasing dose to keep up with tolerance, there might be a point where your body just becomes immune to ritalin and now it does nothing. You can avoid taking it for an entire year, but then start again and you tolerance goes back up within a few weeks...Better to just take breaks...

Those 2 years with ritalin were so nice. sadge...

well excluding when I was taking 30mg twice daily, that was pretty awful in multiple ways.(very easily frustrated, insane dry mouth, massive headaches, naeusea etc)"
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Don’t expect much. I was the same as you “oh my gosh I wonder how I will feel?” And I ended up feeling nothing lol. I also gained a couple pounds on Ritalin; as it did not affect my appetite at all. Also, it ended up helping my sleep at night. I slept through the entire night when I started Ritalin. I also consumed coffee on it with no issue. I just don’t react strongly to stimulants. I have heard this actually is common in people with true ADHD. So you may find zero to little side effects.
I am on adderall now, but I actually miss Ritalin. I felt happy on it. It’s just very very short acting unfortunately and didn’t give the added benefit of weight loss that Adderall gives…that’s literally the only reason I stay on adderall and don’t get back on Ritalin 😬"
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,Don’t start.

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Eat healthy, get at least 8 hours of sleep a night, drink plenty of water, exercise 30 min a day. Meds are great but they are not going to fix everything. If you don’t do the things I listed, the medication will not work as well or even at all. The most important thing for your brain is sleep, water, and balanced nutrition. This will also help to minimize the bad side effects. I’ve been dx’d since I was 7 years old several times through out my life. I’m 33 now. I love my psychiatrist I’ve had now for a few years. She gave me this advice long ago and when I started following it it really made a huge difference and I no longer feel resentful of my diagnosis and struggles with ADHD. Best of luck to you!"

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"I learned that the hard way! But my advice to you is always to eat a snack or a meal before taking Ritalin. I took it on an empty stomach and got really dizzy and nauseous, and I was in tears because I heard all the eye-opening stories about how Ritalin changed people’s lives and I was just getting really sick and felt like I had the flu for a few hours after taking my medicine. I thought I had to power through the side effects cause my doctor told me it was normal to experience nausea and dizziness. Then I read online to eat something beforehand to slow down absorption, and the nausea and dizziness disappeared the first day after I started taking my medicine with food.
Also: remember you are starting at a lower dosage than usual so maybe you won’t experience this life changing feeling the first week or two and that is okay too. This feeling will start to show when you are well medicated and you are slowly getting you life back together."

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"I wish I knew that I wouldn’t be magically immune to the side effects. Ritalin (concerta is what i took) gave me all the regular ones *plus* some of the serious ones and i wasn’t mentally prepared for how much it would physically drain me. be honest with your doctor/psych about the side effects. if you’re too uncomfortable on the medication, it’s not worth it. 
some of the things i’m talking about are, stomach pain, nausea, shakiness, anxiety, increased heart rate, blurry vision, loss of appetite, and excessive sweating. 
i hope you have a good experience with it."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Don't drink coffee with it. It sucks. 
Eat a big breakfast."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,They won't *completely* fix your problems. I always have unrealistic expectations of myself when I'm medicated and end up feeling like I failed.
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Don’t expect euphoria. Your doctor will start you off on a low dosage. The effects will be subtle but you still have to do your part. I find that once I put my phone away I become a whole different person. I take aderall Xr but whatever you do do not take it past 9am and drink lots of water. Wish someone had told me that.

I personally also take breaks from meds. I only use it on work days. I don’t take it on weekends or vacations. I find it helps in not building a tolerance to it."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Liquid IV around 6:30-7pm (when your meds are wearing off and you’ve done all your shit for the day)

Helps mitigate the crash for me 

Apparently vitamin C makes your body process adderall quicker. Liquid iv has a metric fuck ton of vitamin C. It’s helped me avoid that irritability and brain fog around that time!

I’m on 15mg IR adderall twice a day btw. Usually only take 22.5mg tho."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Everyones first reaction is different, dont make conclusions untill you become a bit more stable. The first few days I was really euphoric, like I suddenly could do EVERYTHING. sadly that wore off and is replaced with a more lowkey but way more sustainable improvement to my life. One that I won't burn out from. Honestly I was kinda high those first days. 

I see sometimes people commenting like 'I first started meds HOLY SHIT do neurotipicals always feel like this?????' and while they might, I just dont want anyone to be disappointed when that first euphoria wears off. Euphoria is noce but won't help you in the long run, thats what addiction does."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Check what you're taking with possible food and beverage interactions!

Apparently a good deal of food interacts and cancels the effect of some stimulants(Adderall as far as I know). Like I'm convinced I was actually canceling my Adderall from when I was younger because I drank caffeine and ate a lot of stuff I probably shouldn't have as a kid."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Personally for me, I’m currently trying out the dosages, it seems to work better for me when I take them when I wake up. The reason being  that if I don’t it might take a while (aka hours) before I take them, and then it’s too late in the day, essentially if I can take my time to get out that day

Also learning a lot of new things here… having to take iron supplies and it’s recommended to drink some orange juice with it (haven’t done that a lot tho)… and I like to pair vitamins whit my meds… cause i taking vitamins is boring, and it’s easier to remember that way.. explains some of my crashes

When I started taking them I felt pretty good the first two days, mostly only the first day. After starting on 30mg for a week it wasn’t much, then suddenly they seemed to really kick in (I forgot to take them, crashed for two days). This time tho I was using a different brand, but same thing. So it might be that Ritalin isn’t the one for me idk, but I’ll figure that out XD"
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Just be aware that the first medication may not be the right one & even if it is, sometimes it is still not the right dose.

For me, I started my first medication in May this year (got diagnosed in May), changed the dose every month, then last month, I moved on to a new medication. I think this is better, but still only a week in on the first strength so time will tell if its right or not :-)"
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,Don't forget to take them! (Not that the warning would actually help) lol. Good luck on your new chapter!
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Can't speak for Ritalin as I'm on Vyvanse/ Elvanse but Sleep!!

I'm 2 month in to titration and I find myself getting into a mental tangle as I'm not sleeping enough. I'd usually go to bed around 1am before medication but im still doing it due to stimulants. After 3-4 days I still have the same forwards trajectory thanks to meds but my head isn't where it should be.

So yeah, drink plenty of water but sleep sleep sleep"
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"At first I felt some intensity when first taking tablets. I had slow release concerta and eventually changing to Elvanse which was much better for me.

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"That's It's not a quick fix and sometimes, actually.

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"I was diagnosed ADHD-C in May last year and started on Concerta, which is methylphenidate also. I have also tried Vyvanse, and then come back to Concerta. 

Side effects wise, I found with both of them that the first couple of days I would get a bit irritable and snappy, but it went away after 2-3 days. The most recent time starting back on Concerta my palms got really sweaty for 3 days, and then that stopped. I have a loss of appetite with both, but make sure I schedule eating, so I don't forget.

I found the Concerta works significantly better for me than the Vyvanse does. I tend to notice after starting it initially and after switching back from Vyvanse that it takes a couple of days, but I notice how much easier everything has been for me, and how much quieter my brain has been. 
I find I don't have to have music or tv running when I'm trying to focus, and it helps so much with my emotional regulation. 

It  can take a little while to find the right dosage or the right medication for you, so don't get discouraged if you don't see an immediate difference, because it may just be that it needs to go up in dose or something like that. 

I hope it goes well for you!"
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,Do NOT take it with grapefruit juice!!!! It can dissolve the pill faster than intended if it’s a slow release pill and give you an OD. I did this with my concerta and it almost gave me a heart attack.

My second day on Adderall, I felt great and scrubbed my floors by hand 😂

My third day, I flew into a rage over something small and I remember feeling so mad over my wife over something I knew was no big deal.

That was my last day on Adderall, and I’ve been too scared to return.  

I switched to Strattera and it works pretty well! 

The first few days might be intense, so hang in there!"

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,Drink and eat enough. I didn’t eat anything today and I couldn’t even drive because I’m so lightheaded and confused. If I don’t eat a few hours before it wears off I crash real hard.

Broth will come in super handy to fix the nausea and allow you to eat. I highly recommend keeping some cans of soup handy. 

Also, once you dial in your dosage, if you feel like it’s becoming less effective, take a lower dose on days you don’t need to be as productive. When you take your full dose again, it will feel more effective."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,Take them as early as you can or you’ll be up all night. The headaches/ nausea and upset tummy will pass. Try to eat not long after taking them. Protein bars/ smoothies are good when you can’t face a proper meal. And have a big bottle of water with you at all times!! It’s very easy to get dehydrated and dizzy. Walking is a good way to burn of energy and get rid of the jittery feeling you might get
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"I recently started Ritalin and here's are my thoughts

&#x200B;

\- Get a water bottle that's at least 1 liter. I have a liter water bottle I keep with me at all times. I usually have about half a liter by 10 in the morning, and drink about 3 liters minimum everyday. After taking ritalin, I drink a full liter by 9 and I have another full liter at least by noon, so I have increased my water intake by at least a liter after taking 15-20 mg of ritalin.

&#x200B;

\- Coffee - I usually have 2-3 cups of coffee in the morning. I have one after taking my meds and if I have a second cup my heart starts RACING. If you have coffee first thing in the day, try drinking a smaller cup to start, and then have another one later on if you still want more. 

&#x200B;

\- Mood swings. I don't eat until around 11 for the first time in the day. Ritalin makes me hungry almost immediately, but I don't like eating breakfast because it makes me feel like trash the rest of the day. My problem is I get HANGRY and moody and I turn into a right little bitch when I don't eat often enough. Remind yourself if you start getting moody to get some goddamn food in you!

\- Stimulants can make you hot - I went Black Friday shopping and it was cold outside and about 70 degrees max in the stores I went into, but I was sweating almost the entire time. I think the thing that kept me going was bringing my liter water bottle with me. I drank almost the entire thing in an hour.

&#x200B;

\- If you don't really FEEL different after taking your initial dose, eat a little something before taking anymore. It can hit hard and increase your heart rate. It can feel very close to a panic or anxiety attack if you don't have anything else to slow down your body processing the medication.

I'm still trying to decide if this is the right medication for me, but I still have a lot of time to figure it out :)"

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"I started stimulants before I had other mental diagnosis and found out it worsened other symptoms. If you notice ANYTHING, new or not, journal it. Any mental or physical symptoms, more euphoric or depressive episodes and thoughts. Any reactions you feel might have been inappropriate in any way. 

Think of it as a mix between medical records and a personal book. It will also help you advocate for patterns and such for future doctoring!"
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Not sure if you will see this but this is my experience with ritalin and I hope that people think before taking these mind altering medication. For some it works perfectly but for others it can be awful.

I haven't taken my stimulant medication in a while because of the side effects I get. I was just taken off my prescription for ritalin recently but before then I had concerta.It was constant anxiety and irritation for about 10 hours a day. 

Ritalin was a lot more bearable but by the end of my use I would take a quarter of 10mg and it's still too much. Ritalin is NOT a euphoric stimulant and has almost no recreational value but for me it's so unenjoyable that I can't even do any studying on it.
It feels like stronger, awful caffeine.

There is a reason it's prescribed and that's because it works for people. However you have to know how you've reacted to substances (anything really) in the past and what your body can handle."

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Pay very close attention to how the meds affect you. There can be really serious side effects...the first one I tried (Focalin at 16 Y.O.) made me suicidal. I took that one for just 2 weeks before I had to switch. From there, I took Strattera and Tenex for 11 years. I felt like they weren't working after a while, so about 6 months ago I started taking Vyvanse, which I love! It's the first stimulant that's ever worked for me. But I had to go through more than a few trials and errors with medication after the Strattera became less effective. Honestly, I got really discouraged and didn't think that anything was going to work for me. But after I told my dr. that I also suffered from binge eating disorder, she suggested Vyvanse, which I reluctantly tried. I am so glad that I did!

But the moral of this story is to don't be afraid to keep trying medications until you get the one that is RIGHT for you. While you may experience some mild side effects, they should NOT be debilitating or make you feel like you have to choose being able to focus or dealing with a major side effect. For example, with Vyvanse, I get stomachaches sometimes, especially if I overeat. Sometimes after about 10-12 hrs after taking my pill, I experience ""crash"" when it wears off, and I feel grumpy and a little frayed. But to me, those are very mild side effects that are absolutely worth the benefit that I get from the medication. Give the medication a chance, but don't be afraid to switch."

Meds are great, but the euphoria you might feel at first will wear off, and you might not feel great at the start, a lot of us have to try different dosage and different types before we find one that really works.

Negative effects is that it flattens my emotions a bit and makes me less creative. That can be good for certain tasks, but I only use it when its benefitial.

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Never had Ritalin, but some things I’ve learned with Adderall over the years:

1. Clear your schedule. You never know what day 1 is gonna be like so just keep it open. Don’t promise anything to anyone, don’t have any deadlines or meetings, nothing. Today is a free day.

2. Take it earlier in the day — hopefully close to when you’d normally like to take it during the workweek. Try to take it at the same time every day.

3. For the first day, I’d recommend not drinking caffeine. You’re trying to see what the baseline is for you. I went from pounding 4 cups of coffee a day to 1 or less, some people ended up not needing it at all, some people it didn’t change. But for day one, try to skip it if you can.

4. Take it with food. For some reason if I take adderall and get in a car on an empty stomach, I will puke. Food alleviates this.

5. If you’re feeling any weird symptoms (and I mean WEIRD), don’t panic, but Google your symptom + Ritalin and see what pops up. I had a weird symptom when I got back on meds where I felt like my leg was detachable at the hip and it turned out to be an uncommon side effect of the medication. Knowing it was to be expected put me at ease and the symptom went away within a few days.

6. Take notes on how you feel. If you’re not feeling any difference or if you’re feeling too pulled in random directions, your doctor can make dosage adjustments. Detailed notes will help them with that!

7. MOST IMPORTANT: Set realistic expectations. Basically, meds don’t “fix everything.” My therapist and psychiatrist both said “there’s no pill to make you a good employee.” Meds don’t automatically give you discipline, but they do remove a lot of the boundaries that made cultivating discipline hard in the first place. You can’t expect to suddenly fall into a perfect routine, but you can expect that executive dysfunction to be muted enough to get started on fostering habits that build into said routine.

8. If sleeping is difficult for you, try taking it earlier in the day, melatonin at night, and/or talking to your doctor about a different medication/dosage. I switched from XR to regular and my sleep improved, for example.

You got this, good luck!

EDIT: non-ADHD people are inclined to say that ADHD meds are addictive but I feel like that doesn’t often apply to ADHD people, who regularly forget to take their meds. I had to get a pill organizer, otherwise I constantly questioned whether or not I took it that day and, to be safe, would frequently not take it to be on the safe side (wouldn’t want to accidentally take 2x the dose). Getting a weekly pill organizer can help you remember if you’ve actually taken it or not!"

What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"I'm on dexamphetamine so different substance, but: for me that it doesn't solve everything. It's like; congratulations, we strapped your broken leg together. But you still have to put the work into getting up the stairs!

For me, the first few days I was amazed at how much getting-things-done-power I had. Then it stabilizes, and life just becomes ""normal"", and you notice only how little you get done when you \*don't\* take the meds. That was the case for me anyway.

I'm not really super careful anymore with alcohol as I find that it doesn't interact \*that\* much although I still do a mental calculation of when I had my last dose when someone asks if I want a beer. I stick to like, no alcohol within the same 4/5 hours as my last dose. Same with coffee - I drink a fair amount, but once I had TOO much, like an ungodly amount, and apparently the two together are mildly toxic and I was super nauseous for like half a day."

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"I started vyvanse this week. 

I never got the Ah-hah moment, but there was a significant and noticeable difference between that first day in meds and all those days before it. I had… choices. I never get to choose what I do or where my brain wants to focus, but that day and every day I’ve taken it since, I’ve been able to make a to-do list and stick to it. It’s wonderful. The first day, I didn’t do anything productive at all — but it was my choice. 

Here is a tip: meds aren’t going to make you work, or give you the structure necessary to take care of your house or yourself. Start your day with a big glass of water and a pad of paper and pick a few things to focus on that day. (I have a rule: two productive things a day. I pick what I want those things to be and that’s what I work on.) Ask your family or housemates to point out chores they’d like you to help with WHEN THEY NEED IT DONE, because it’ll make remembering to do that thing again later a little easier. Remind yourself to brush your teeth and put on deodorant, like with post its on the mirror or something. Think of meds like they’re a brand new oven you’ve got installed — it’s there, but it won’t bake a cake on its own. That’s still on you. 

Speaking of delicious cake… My mood has been stellar, too! I’ve felt generally pretty happy this week. Even on the day I skipped (though I was exhausted that day). My anxiety is at an all-time low. 

Be mindful of your heart rate and blood pressure; I’ve noticed an uptick in mine. (I’m going to try to exercise a bit to bring it down as best as I can, and I think it’ll be easy now that I can just DO things!) 

I NORMALLY have a come down on vyvanse. I get real tired in the afternoon and a bit cranky, in a PMS sort of way. And until today, I’ve been going to bed way earlier than my norm. Id prefer that to right now though; my crash never came and I stayed up way too late!"

Make sure you're on something with tolerable & easily remedied side effects for your body. 💖 

And they're right, you may get angry when you realize how unnecessarily difficult your life was before. Allow yourself to feel & process that, but if it starts dragging you down, try to focus on the things ways your ADHD enhances your life!

Avoid coffee at the start but I’ve been fine drinking it.

Stimulants turned me from a weekly social binge drinker to having had less than 20 drinks this year with the longest period of 8 months no alcohol. Utilise that. 

Take your vitamins and drink plenty of water. 

Don’t put pressure on them to be an active DOING thing. For me they enabled me to fully fix my sleep schedule, which has allowed me to function much much more effectively and therefore do a lot more. The drums don’t actually make me do things that still comes from within but they help me get started and establish routines, which is why I say again, take them at the same time every day."

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"As for sleep, personally, I take amphetamine TO SLEEP sometimes 😂 you might find it works like a Xanax.

As for feeling anything, expect your eyes to feel strained. Expect your teeth to want to grind each other, and expect this insane calm wash over you.

When I started the calm was the scariest thing. I wanted to stop immediately because I was so calm. It felt wrong when nowadays it feels really right. It'll feel right after a month or so."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"The first change I noticed with my meds (female diagnosed at 28) was that I spoke in complete sentences. I didn’t ramble, or make so many tangents, or lose my train of thought halfway through, or struggle for multiple seconds to think of the word I’m trying to use. My mom noticed it over the phone. And my husband told me he now can tell when my meds wear off around dinner time, because I don’t stop talking. 😅
Most of the changes I’ve noticed are little things. I don’t get overwhelmed as easily and it’s easier to juggle multiple tasks/inputs. It’s easier to stay focused on one task and then switch to another. I don’t ping from thing to thing, which I used to do and never finished tasks/projects. I’m so much more functional, but it’s not a feeling of “my meds kicked in and now I’m focused.” I notice it in the evening when I say “my meds have 100% worn off because everything is chaotic.” Meds have not been a magic fix and some days are better than others (thanks female hormones), but I just feel so much lighter when I’m doing things. The barrier to entry has lessened significantly.

Circling back to hormones: if you are not on birth control and your hormones naturally fluctuate, research the effects of female hormones on executive functioning. The knowledge can help you track and understand any pattern of when your meds are more or less effective. And some doctors who are well-versed in this topic may prescribe different dosages based on where a person is in their cycle. I haven’t had the need to pursue this treatment plan personally, but I definitely notice the regular pattern in my symptoms."

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"I wish I had known that the first few days aren't ""normal"". That ""finally having glasses"" moment passes and stops being a novelty pretty soon. It's still there, don't get me wrong, but don't expect it to be as breath taking once you get used to stimulants.

Also; less is more. For me at least. I thought stimulants should make me into a super productive person who never gets side tracked. Because I didn't know what ""normal"" is. Higher dosages can also give you the dreaded zombie effect - that doesn't mean stimulants are wrong for you, it just means the dosage is too high. 

I'm now on a pretty low dosage that doesn't give me too many side effects and am doing much much better than on a higher dosage. 

And long acting stimulant formulations might not work for everyone and might be too much! I wanted to get on a long acting formula right away because I was desperate to be as symptom free for as long as possible. Turns out I am a slow metabolizer and it overwhelms my body and mind. 

I'm now on Ritalin LA and it's enough most days. It lingers for a while after and it's actually nice to not be super efficient during the evening. 

And finally: stimulants aren't a cure all. If you're at the right dose and tolerate them you'll feel much much more capable, emotionally stable, be able to stay attentive etc. But it won't fix everything magically. You'll still have to put in work to make them as effective as possible and some symptoms will stay with you. That's OK. No ""normal"" person is able to always give a 100% either. We're not supposed to be efficient every second of every day.

Edit: also: stay hydrated and eat (especially proteins)! AFAIK ritalin LA is the only stimulant that isn't too much effected by food; for every other it's very important to eat for them to be effective."

But Ritalin helps me stay focused on tasks, completing the boring tasks as laundry even though I can see my pencils or pilates ball. Before I could spend days on completing the boring tasks as I was too drawn against the fun ones. I hear from my loved ones all the time that they hoped ritalin had more effect on me.

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Okay... here's my advice based on my experience...   


\> transitions can be HARD (as in taking meds having them kick in, timing your next dose, and when they wear off), physically hard for some, this went away for me, but when the meds 'ran out' at the end of the day my skin was crawling  
\> you won't magically be different. You'll still be you.   
\> you will probably have less appetite.   
\> your first dose probably won't be the one you  stick to. I found doubling my dose was really really helpful. But try not to think too far in the future - one day at a time.   
\> you may find you overwork yourself - you may get into a flow and find wow you are doing everything - without the procrastination breaks you normally have you might EXHAUST yourself. This happened to me. I didn't listen, lfmf.   
\> the biggest change for me is with impulse control - I can follow what I'm into and not get pulled away from things, and I don't feel inclined to head toward ""dopamine seeking"" and external validation.   


I keep sweets (hard candy and stuff) that have interesting textures/tastes nearby for a little sugar boost and for meds transition distraction."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"You might not be the one who notices the difference first, it might be a few days or even a week before it affects you much, be careful with or avoid alcohol because it can interact weird sure but it might also make you not realize how much you’ve had, if you can normally drink coffee and feel sleepy and not energized don’t think ah I can have some coffee it’s fine, no you probably can’t I drank two small cups of coffee at work my first week on adderall and it felt like my eyes were being held open and I was vibrating, I can have a little coffee here and there now but definitely take it slow at first to find your limit. You might not feel hunger anymore, eat a large meal before you take the medicine. You might feel sick at first for most people it goes away after a week or two but If after a month the medicine isn’t working for you or you still feel sick don’t be afraid to talk to your doctor about a different dose or different medicine. It took me 4 medications until I found one that both worked and the side effects were tolerable you aren’t a bad person and you are still valid if you need to try more than one option before finding what works, You’ll still have ADHD forgive yourself for all the struggles in the past and all the potential struggles you’ll encounter because when you get on medicine and it really starts working you’ll realize how much harder things were without it and you might feel angry at yourself and others for the struggles you’ve endured your feelings can be valid but be kind to yourself."

I am on Elvanse 40-80mg a day depending on where I am on my cycle. 

Estrogen levels have a really big influence on whether medication not only sticks to receptors, but stay there too. So if you don’t already, track your menstrual cycle. 

Also, take note that Ritalin can play devils advocate on your hormones. I switched from Elvanse (having a period every single month for a year), to Xaggitin for 9 days before being unable to cope with the side effects, and haven’t had a period since, and I’m now 57 days late."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,Its possible to have adhd and bipolar together.  If that's the case then taking stimulants alone is really going to fuck your shit up. I wish somebody told me this. Made my life an irredeemable hell
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Drink lots of water. Like minimum 2L/day.

Avoid caffeine until you get used to the dose. Alcohol will also dry you right out and the hangovers are much worse on stimulants.

Your sleep may be shakey at first but should even out. If it wasn’t for the hormonal side effects of concerta I’d still be on because goddamn I slept *hard*."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Different drugs work differently for different people. If this doesn’t give you the effect you want (meaning **all** the effects you want, not just some of them) then there’s no harm in trying something else. 

Avoid alcohol at least at first. Make sure you sleep enough."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"That the first dose or medication doesn't necessarily have to be the right one, that it might need to be adjusted (as in one could need less or even more, bot hif possible), that some might need to take a booster dose for the so called ""crash"" some experience.  


  
Also that vitamin C is usually a no go and can negate effects or make it work less or for a shorter amount of time, drinking a lot and taking lots of protein is very recommended and helps the medication do its work better (esp. from the protein, it seems) and that one should keep an eye on the weight!  


  
I for my part got all these points just from reading stuff on here and which is stuff I never knew about before, but the weight stuff was a really big issue for me as well as the crash, so I stopped the meds as a kid after just a month or smth of taking them D:

anymore, they still might/could and one might just not notice it atm."

Just got diagnosed with adhd (24f) and they told me to avoid weed now as it can increase risk of psychosis. I occasionally enjoy an edible to sleep and would rather not cut that out completely. Is there actually a risk having both? Does anyone have more info on this? 

Psych also said alcohol is fine as long as it’s at night and the Ritalin has worn off, what if I drink before it’s worn off?"

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,Ritalin is the worst. Try to ask your doc if you can possibly go on vyvanse instead. Ritalin causes bad neurological personality issues in the long term. I know from many many many different walks of life for this to be true so don’t try and come at me :-)

Just no one cared enough to follow up because my grades were good, so I was doing fine and would grow out of the other problems."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Aghhh, I bet that’ll come. The more I learn about adhd the more I see it in my mom too. My parents are very traditional and always thought psych help was for “crazy people.” I pushed to see one in high school, got misdiagnosed with depression and put on SSRIs which didn’t help and made me feel at a loss for years, and finally I’m seeking help again. Thanks for sharing your experience, always encouraging to hear about others doing what’s best for them."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,Yeah I remember when I started taking mine and I was like “wtf you guys live like this all the time”
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"I’d definitely second this. I felt very angry, resentful, and depressed for a few months once I started taking stimulants. You realize how different, and likely better, your life could’ve been leading up to this point."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"I’ll offer an alternative POV as someone who was on adderall 10mg starting at age 10. I would fight with my mom when it came to taking it because I felt high. Like legit high. I would try to listen to my teachers but they sounded muffled, like the Peanuts adults. I was in a fog for most of the morning, until about after lunch when the medication started wearing off. 

When I fell off the medication a year or two later and my parents didn’t bother to get me back on it, I didn’t fight it because I hated “who” it made me become. I went through a lot of depression partially because I felt like no one liked me unless I was medicated to the high heavens, too stoned out of my mind to do or say anything. Basically, only lobotomized very_bored_panda is a likeable very_bored_panda.

“She always had great grades, but she went from being disruptive in class to being quiet and calm! What an improvement!” — internalized as “She was performing well academically but who she is as a person is unacceptable. Let’s make her a zombie, then we’ll accept her!” I hated it with my entire being and had something of an existential crisis over it? Probably not the right word. But it made me withdraw from everyone since I wasn’t “good enough” for them and I resented it immensely.

Obviously this is purely anecdotal and not everyone had the same experience, and who is to say that would have been yours. But it took me 20 years and a lot of therapy before finally feeling strong enough to “preserve” myself at my core while still taking meds."

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,I was going to say my answer would be “that I should have started them decades ago.”
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Yup. I was 35 when I got diagnosed and my parent hadn't even considered the possibility (there was medical negligence on physical things as well). I was so fucking mad that no one noticed, and have since been working through the grief of all those lost years."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,100% you need to focus on what you can now Dow thanks to the medicine. Try not to think about what your life would have been like before you started your meds.
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,Or just anger.  Irritability is a big one.

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"In my late 30’s and after a couple weeks on meds I came to this conclusion as well. Only mad at myself as I took meds as a kid but took myself off them (I hated how I felt on Ritalin). Well adderall has certainly changed my life. It’s been an evolution / process, and it continues to be one."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Here's my own personal experience: 
Strattera actually literally made me angry. It made me irritable enough to want to stop taking it. It also didn't interact well with alcohol and even made me more thoroughly forgetful. Without strattera I'd at least get the ""feeling"" that I forgot something, so I could double check. On strattera I would just straight up forget, without any cues.

I didn't really notice much improvement except that I was slightly better at my first person shooting game. So I just stopped taking it. I'm a little sad about that, though, because I need a non stimulant adhd med since I've become sensitive to stimulants (due to a period of time where I drank too many energy drinks, heh)

Taking Wellbutrin actually helped a decent amount with my adhd symptoms, though that isn't the reason it was prescribed. 

Anyway, I was lucky enough to be prescribed Ritalin then Adderall XR as a kid and got straight A's in school, loved learning and even doing homework... until I stopped taking it in middle school and started skipping homework  and getting b's and c's. I still loved learning and did great on tests, but just couldn't bring myself to finish assignments on time. That among other things snowballed and yeah, unmedicated adhd can really suck."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Piggybacking onto this. A lot of products are marketed as a meal replacement drinks nowadays. If you're using it regularly to supplement your diet, it's worth speaking to your doctor about brands.

Is it just because the medication might keep you from wanting to eat, or because it works better with food?

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"This is a good comment OP. Especially the part about figuring out the “multipliers”. This took me months to get the hang off. Especially sleep for me is important to get the right effect from my meds. If I am unrested and stressed, my meds tend to give me a nudge in that direction instead of making me feel better."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Your mileage may vary on a lot of these, though--I've never had a 'crash' at any dosage or form, whether generic or name-brand Adderall, 10mg or 20, XR or IR. The worst I've dealt with was some migraines for a while (scary, since I usually don't even get headaches except once or twice a year), and then me and my GP realized I was having them on days where I was under a shitload of stress (no headaches since cutting off contact with my abusive parents!!)

One thing I will say to OP though is that **if you are having arrhythmia or a racing heart, talk to your doctor first.** I've had an arrhythmia all my life and my first medication (20mg IR generics) exacerbated it, so my doctor halved the dose to 10mg XR and put me on name-brand, which *mostly* fixed it. **But it later turned out that my arrhythmia was caused by deficiencies in magnesium and B12.** So now he put me on the new 20mg generic XR from a specific manufacturer and it's the best one I've tried yet, and might be the perfect one for me.

One more thing: **Pay attention to how the meds make you feel. Are they making you euphoric, or agitated? If so, then they're likely not the right meds**. People on here often mistake the initial euphoria for how the meds are supposed to make you feel, but that's not always the case. If the euphoria is keeping you from being as productive as you need to be, it's too much. I knew my current meds were the right ones when I felt a slight mood boost, but mostly a calm readiness to get to work. I'm now much more productive than I ever was when I was halfway distracted by my euphoria."

On my first day of taking Adderall, I immediately felt all the great effects. Less distracted by my wandering thoughts, cell phone, and emails. I was more present with my wife and daughter. I thought it’s crazy how happy I was and I couldn’t believe what I was missing. 

This is a common side effect of euphoria when you first start. It fades, and it’s supposed to fade. My experience is just like what someone above stated: I don’t feel positive effects, I just notice that I’m more productive, present, and happier. 

Obv. my experience is not the same as everyone else’s - just be aware this may not be the normal effect of the medicine."

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"My above comment says the actual important things in my opinion, but of you still feel like reading more im gonna abuse this context to counter a bunch of over confident advice ive read here which super annoyed me:

Caffeine: can cause some shaking and hyperactiveness but **definitely not** a globally forbidden, for example, I drink coffee in the morning before i take attent xr (amphetamines), and another coffee around 4 pm with ritalin to carry me through the rest of the day. I had some bad side effects with coffee and other meds, but its definitely allowed and might be good for you depending on your schedule.

Alcohol: basically not recommended with any medicine, but it wont kill you to drink every now and then, (even with the meds), i drink a lot less because alcohol side effects are worse for me with meds (hangover+bad sleep), but it wont stop me from partying on special occasions.

Vitamin C: honestly dont know wtf and how someone here can be **SO SURE** that it causes crashes, I literally drank orange juice yesterday, did not have a crash. tf.
Especially since theres so much other stuff in orange juice that could cause it, phew... okay that got a bit too personal, sorry.

Generally when it comes to diet/nutrition and adhd, you should tale into account just your own experience, and maybe some relevant researches. I once read a post here that asked about acidic foods and medication, and almost every comment stating ""food X causes Y"" had a contradicting comment saying the opposite, by someone elses experience. 
So just do your own experiments, its hard, but it is what it is.

I do however want to support drinking **WATER** AND **REGULAR MEALS**, even though its just basic human needs, that stuff's super important and easily forgotten when on meds.

If you got all the way down here....

I would get a lot of bad stomachaches, especially if I overate; I do get them sometimes still, but not as much. The crash also got easier to handle and less noticeable the more time I was on the medication. I also noticed that crash could come at different times. 

What dose are you on? My doctor started me at 10 mg, and at first, I found that even that was too much (I am really sensitive to medication). I'd use the water titration method to take just half of the pill--5 mg. That helped for a while, but I did feel like I needed to go up after a while, so I started taking the full 10 mg. That's what I'm on now, and I'm pretty stable there. I'm not counting going up again out, but I think I'll be okay here for a while. I know Vyvanse goes up really high in mg, so I'd just question your dose (isn't 30 mg common to start with?) and try coming down. This should help if you want to cut down your dose and see if your crash decreases: [https://www.corepsych.com/vyvanse-dosage-water-titration-recipe/](https://www.corepsych.com/vyvanse-dosage-water-titration-recipe/)"

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"I don’t think there’s any reason for being mad at parents because of this. As time goes on you realise your parents are just humans with a bunch of fucked up issues just like yourself, and not wanting to medicate a child isn’t so insidious. I was diagnosed with autism and adhd as a child and wasn’t told by my mother until I was 24. I’m glad she didn’t tell me, I suffered a lot but learnt to be strong and learnt to “mask” due to the fact I wasn’t aware of my condition, so I’d have the mindset of “I have to try fix my issues” rather than delegate the manifestation of such issues to my condition - as children often do. A sick child will try exploit that shit to the max to get outa things. 

Being treated as an adult, with the strength and resilience gained through growing up suffering and untreated - is probably optimal imo and I’m just thankful there’s ways to help my conditions. I feel sorry for my parents and the struggles they went through to raise me."

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Aw then figure out how to make the Ritalin work. If you hate it get immediate release and take it as you need it so you don’t take a long acting version and get stuck on the ride for 6-12 hours. Id Ritalin was my only option id get immediate release so I have control over much of a work horse zombie it turns me into. But as I’ve gotten older I’ve realized it’s best when I take them everyday and med breaks aren’t necessary and the medical data behind it is iffy as widely disputed. So take ‘em daily and find the medication that works for you. Long acting for long smooth coverage (after time you might able to take an immediate release tablet when your long acting wears off) or the immediate release multiple times a day with peaks and valleys. You have to go through a doctor and they have a key role in your access but don’t ever forget you’re the one in control. Figure out how to communicate with your doctor and bring the pills with you to your appointments to establish trust as these are super abusable and people love ‘em. Watch your heart rate and be honest with yourself as to why and when to take it. I have to take mine for work but it helps me socially too so I even took it yesterday for the social anxiety and how much better I socialize on the stuff. Some people only need it for work so if you don’t need it socially don’t bother with it as it light keep you up at night and all that. Also the main reason I take the meds is for the emotional regulation and Im covered round the clock and sleep well but that’s just me. Whatever limits or commutation nuances you have to figure out with your doctor just remember you’re in control particularly after you’re on or for a while and you know your dose, when to take it, if/when you don’t need coverage. Some people literally only need it for their work week and more power to them because they DON’T need em on weekends. But starting out take it daily as it’s a powerful drug and your body and mind need to get accustomed to it. Give it one week with every formulary or dosage change before you make up you’re mind that it’s working. I’m in the US and believe they’re widely over prescribed but I’m a legit case. So many psychiatrists have told me that and then made sure to tell me I’m really smart so that’s been nice to know. Anyway, best of luck to you and I know nothing about Ritalin or how adhd is handled in France so that’s all I got!"
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"I'm in France too it is so backward with adhd ! Sadly methylphenidate (Ritaline or Concerta) didn't work for me, but you can have other medication, such as the atomoxetine (straterra) if you go to an hospital to make the prescription. Then you can renew it with the original prescription to a generalist up to a year and take the medicine in a hospital pharmacy only. 
Good luck and hope methylphenidate work for you !"
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"I actually think the vitamin C advice applies to methylphenidates too, not just amphetamine based meds!"
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,Also want to add: eat breakfast before you take the meds and have lunch at the same time each day. You won’t be hungry but after a week you condition you body to expect food around then. Don’t know if there’s any science to this but it helped me when I got on stimulants 6 months ago
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"I got started on meds here in France about 4 months ago so if you have any questions feel free to DM 

Good news is meds are now covered by the secu so they're free ! 

About the bad news tho : 
Some doctors have no clue about ADHD and meds because we're not as advanced as anglo-speaking countries on the matter. As always, language barrier makes it so all research arrives a few years later. But it's getting better and better, but make sure to be cautious about the doctors you seek and don't be afraid to seek another one if you don't have a good feeling. 

Pharmacist are about as aware. Again, seek a good one and keep it, you'll need it for point 3. 

And finally, the process of getting your meds every month is a pain in the ass. You need a written & dated paper prescription from your doctor that has the name & adress of the pharmacy on it. You need the original. You need to go the pharmacy in the 3 days after the date in the prescription. You need to go to the exact pharmacy that is mentionned on your prescription. Otherwise they can't give it to you, since our meds are classified as narcotics. Copies or scans of the prescription are not accepted. If you come on day too late, no meds. If you go to another pharmacy, no meds.

It can be a bit of a mess to organise everything at first especially if your pharmacy is not used to giving this medication since they also have to fill papers and yadda yadda so brace yourself

Bon courage !"
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Don’t feel bad about it, it seems like everyone learns this fact from other adhd people on here or other social platforms and not from their dr/pharmacist and it’s so annoying! You’re definitely not alone though, this is 100% not your fault."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,Positive. I’ve been on amphetamine based meds on and off for 14 years. Some people find it diminishes the effect or kills it and some people don’t get any effect whatsoever from washing their meds down with vitamin c aka ascorbic acid. It was the only variable in my very consistent diet as of that day. I also have had 3 crashes in my entire life. For me the meds just wear off but it was a legit amphetamine crash. Medicated or unmedicated I’m pretty articulate and I’m very well read so sentence structure not working? It was a crash. Not everyone gets affected like I do so I save my vitamin c intake for the evening because it can totally fuck up my day. Look it up!
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,It's the sugar. Vitamin c does not do this.
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"I’d say it’s a bit of both. I always eat right after I take my Vyvanse, before the appetite suppression kicks in. If not, it doesn’t seem to work nearly as well and can also cause some weakness and dizziness because your body still needs food even if your mind is telling you that it doesn’t want it.

And then of course, you still need to eat at least a couple times a day, but your meds might last long enough to prevent you from feeling hungry when your body needs additional nourishment, so that’s where forcing yourself to eat even after it kicks in comes into play.

I can’t tell you how many times on Vyvanse that I’ve wondered why I feel so weak and terrible and then I’m like “duh, I’m a living being, I need food.” It’s kind of weird that there are substances that can make you forget you have to have nutrition, but that’s just one of those things you eventually have to learn when being medicated for ADHD.

It’s even worse when your mouth is dry and everything is *extra* unappetizing, lol."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"It’s because any stimulant out there will suppress your appetite and adhd or not, you probably get extra energy from your meds even if they chill you out. I run further, faster and longer with less fatigue when I run especially right after my meds kick in. And Vyvanse takes a whole 2 hours to kick in and a lot people don’t know that. I’ll begin to notice in within 45 min full stomach or not and some people set an alarm so they wake up and take their meds then go right back to sleep. That way they wake up with the meds active in their system. I have all day coverage but I like having those 2ish hours with my adhd brain. I love the way I think but to hold down a job and clean my apartment and it’s kind of a mood stabilizer for me so I’m medicated and I’m not gonna go off off them unless my heart rate gets out of whack or something like that happens. I’m 34 and still getting my shit together so it’s time I quit taking breaks from meds (drug holidays have not been proven to be effective yet the data out there is still inconclusive) and I don’t deal with tolerance stuff. I’m a high dose guy anyway so if I run into trouble with the dosage maybe I’ll take a week off and (I can’t drive unmedicated, I’ve had so many car accidents it’s unsafe) be cautious with what I do in that time. Im not going off them for a long time"
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"They’re similar medications so they work well together to manage my brain and my adhd. The Vyvvanse takes longer to kick in but it’s the best medication I’ve ever tried. I have a weird thing where vyvanse taken daily (I don’t do med holidays because driving is unsafe for me to be unmedicated doing so) only works for 8 months. I can take it at 4pm and be our cold by midnight so I go through it fairly quickly. I sleep better on Vyvanse than I do Dexedrine. Dexedrine takes about 45 min to kick in (extended release) and def feels more amplified in the “oh ya I’m on an amphetamine” department so I’m not fond of that as I’m sober and have dealt with more than my fair share of substance use issues. Hyper focus can be problem but equally so unmedicated and Medicare it’s that I get more done medicated. Dexedrine makes me feel less anxious than Vyvanse even though they both chill me out. I never feel like they’re too much. I have a rapid metabolism so I have trouble gaining weight and taking two extended release stimulants is DEFINITELY not for everyone. So I’d say Vyvanse is smoother and better at controlling my symptoms (not by much) and Dexedrine feels more amplified but does make me more calm. I’m they’re really similar and I’ve never taken the immediate release formula and I don’t really have an interest in going to IR. I’d be fine taking 3 15-20mg Adderall tablets a day but I get way more coverage out of the extended release versions. And I really take the meds for emotional regulation as I cannot do that on my own and become unstable off of them and I have a “mood disorder” so I also take Latuda and that drug right there changed my life. With both on board I’m stable man, three actually. Without em im emotionally unstable and a danger behind the wheel."

I have included all of these to my routine with a low dose medication (Adderall 20 rx) :


Protein focused breakfast 

Stay hydrated, loads of water !

Get good & consistent sleep (I use Melatonin when I’m having a hard time falling asleep)

•Omega 3

•L-Theanine

•B6 + B12

•D3

•L-Tyrosine (I take it on days were I’m extra tired or have IT training to get through)

•Sea moss gel (that I make myself from sea moss added to a smoothie mid-day if I have low appetite)

•Avoiding sugary foods

•Avoiding anything with Red 40 (or Allura Red)

•Magnesium (it has great benefits but in my case since I have enough in my diet, it made me a little too “not constipated” if you know what I mean so I stopped taking it)

•Avoiding heavy carbs (like pasta) in the middle of the day, they make you tired af

•Avoiding caffeine, weirdly it makes us more tired & more physically wired therefor we get the shakes & heart palpitations instead of focus, which sucks lol 

•Daily exercice, even if it’s a simple 15 minutes of yoga or Pilates, does wonders

•Good healthy balanced diet & daily fresh air, if you can be next to a natural water source EVEN BETTER


Things I’ll be adding :

•Ashwagandha

•Lion’s Mane



Things I do not take because I am on stimulants but can help :

•Rhodiola rosea

•Ginkgo biloba


Obviously, I am not a medical professional, you should do your own research/talk to your doctor before adding anything to your diet.

Hope it helps ❤️

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"There are a lot of ways to treat symptoms. They're not as effective but they can help. 

1. A well-balanced diet so you're not sugar crashing and you're getting plenty of vitamins. Especially magnesium. 

2. Ginseng is a natural stimulant that can help some people. 

3. Maintaining positive routines. My smart watch is so helpful for this. I set reminders to eat, leave for work, etc .

4. Telling people close to you what your struggles are so that you have a support system. 

I did all of these things and it did work for awhile.... But ultimately I did need to be medicated. I couldn't drink enough coffee to make my brain work. (Every once in awhile it clicked into place, but not often)

There are therapists that can help you try natural routes. Many are online and covered by insurance."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,Cannabis can help. But amphetamines are very effective with minimum side effects for me. But CBG and THC can be helpful and make life more pleasant and mellow. But you can over do it. An SSRI with low dose amphetamines have changed my life and let me enjoy life again.
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Take the pill upon awakening and remember every ADHD brain is incredibly different than anyone else’s ADHD along with your mind and body’s resold to the medication. And however bossy or controlling or rigid your prescriber is, don’t ever forget you are in the driver’s seat and this is your experience. Your symptoms to manage and you’re the one taking the meds. I get like 6ish hours not counting the 2 hours it takes to kick in. People’s experience with the duration of Vyvvanse varies A LOT. Again, it takes 2 hours to kick in and some people are low dose peeps and I’m a high dose guy. If I could do 40mg (low in my opinion) once a day man I’d love that. But I’m on 70mg after i thought 50mg was working until I got some feedback at work so ya, I’ve missed a few things. Find the right dose that works, if you crash really bad I’d ask your doctor very soon (no shorter than a week)  I’d ask your doctor for a booster which is like 50% less dosage wise of your extended release medication that’s the rule. Adderall is the closest and most accessible immediate release medication to Adderall. Don’t feel like a druggie if you need an increase and if you’re nervous about it write down your symptoms and how much the medication is covering for you (I used tk do this) and literally read it to the doctor because you will forget something important. If you feel you need to max out the dosage (70mg) bring a loved one with you who can answer questions on your behavior. Doctors fucking love both seeing that someone like us has a support system and hearing about you’re symptoms from their perspective will give the prescriber more confidence in their decisions and more solid data to work with. High dose (I avoid it completely during the morning and day) vitamin c will fuck with your body’s ability to absorb the medication 2hours before and after. Moderate caffeine!! Don’t drink coffee all day and I’ll only have a 3rd cup if I didn’t sleep more than 4 hours the night before. SLEEP A LOT. Get plenty of rest and your meds won’t do much if you’re not well rested so again take it early since some people actually do get 14 hours out of it. Dosage is  personal and drug holidays have not been proven to help adhd management in any way yet, the studies are still inconclusive. The stimulants give you better emotional regulation which is why I take mine daily, I’m pretty unstable without it and I’ve been misdiagnosed as bipolar more than once. I can take it at 4pm and sleep by midnight but that’s a terrible idea as most people won’t sleep at all if they do that. Play with the timing to find what works for you then same time everyday. Same bedtime everyday. Same wake up time everyday. Sleep is so important for ADHD. Be nice to the pharmacy staff and don’t feel weird about anything. If your pharmacist is an asshole about the meds go somewhere else. Refills are a bitch anyway as you have to call or drop by the pharmacy for them to fill it. This forum is here for social support and I’m knowledgeable but always ask your pharmacist about interactions etc. and don’t ask Reddit for direct medical advice. Someone will answer and it’s gonna be wrong info they could harm you. Lastly, think of the person you spend the most time with and tell them about your meds and ask talk to the about it. Oh other last thing, people will steal your meds so don’t tell everyone you know, lock them up in a med box and hide it. Two separate people have stolen meds from me because I’m open about shit and I used to trust so blindly. I’m call that good"
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Write down your symptoms and what’s being controlled, what’s not and by how much.

I was really afraid to mention side effects because the meds worked SO WELL and I didn’t want to give that up, but there are so many different combinations and dosages that can be tried so I’d recommend you always be honest as they’ll be able to help."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"I was going to say this same thing. First week of being on Vyvanse my jaw muscles were stiff and sore.

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Yes, the clenching and jawing is real. Reminded me of doing cocaine recreationally in college back in the 'before time' when it was a common party drug. When you're onboarding new ADHD meds, sometime it's nice to have hard candies available to wet your mouth, but be sure not to suck vigorously on them, and stay far away from mint and cinnamon candies and menthol cough drops because they will burn your mouth after awhile."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Totally understandable, but yeah even just having that intention puts you in a better position than I was in, and I'm sure you can find plenty of resources online to help sort of figure out what types of things you can do in lieu of therapy. Sounds like you already have a pretty good idea. Good luck and like others have said, be open with your psychiatrist about how it affects you. Not everyone gets the right medication or even dosage on the first try."

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,Happy to help. I have no idea what happened with the decaf but it’s happened more than once so thought I should warn others lol it happened when I had 1-2 regular coffees in the morning and then decaf in the afternoon. So severe that I had to stop for a bathroom even though I was 5 minutes from home so be careful!
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,It cuts down on the bad side effects like the gacked out feeling and being easily irritated.
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Also, take it on an empty stomach, amphetamines are less absorbed in an acidic environment, so take it with water not juice/pop/coffee, wait at least 30 mins before eating because that stimulates acid production.

There's also evidence Vitamin C can increase the body's metabolism of amphetamines, meaning they'll be cleared out of your system much faster.  I personally can feel this and anything with moderate to high doses of vitamin C just feels like an off switch for my meds, so pay attention to how you feel, most veggies/fruits/juices or health/energy drinks, and obviously any vitamin supplement that contains it.

Like everyone else said, eat fats/proteins and keep a quick snack on you, it can cause your brain to basically burn more fuel so need to take in more to compensate."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Depends on how sensitive you are to caffeine. I think it's best to try it out at home. Caffeine increases dopamine receptor density, so there's sort of a synergistic effect"
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,it definitely depends how much u drink and how strong it is. I would suggest a low amount of caffeine but just be careful cause mixing meds and caffeine is where heart problems start haha. Definitely consult your doc about it or look up what drinking caffeine can do while on that specific med.
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"You can play with your coffee doses to see what works for you, I used to drink a double espresso in the morning, a latte for lunch, a black americano as a ""snack"", and would almost daily order from the Starbucks near my job to help me function better at work (iced, highly caffeinated with starbucks usual pumps of sugar were a blessing for my bored brain). When I first started my meds, I could barely finish the double espresso, to the point where I got scared and stop drinking coffee altogether, which before the meds I would've never thought I could do but I still missed the taste, so I drank an americano and realized I didn't feel like I felt with the double espresso, next day, drank a latte with just one espresso shot and felt fine, and so on. I currently drink decaf in the morning and a latte in the afternoon, that's the amount of coffee I found ""worked"" the best for me, since I don't want to stop drinking it. 

I should also mention, I don't crave or need coffee like I used to before the meds, there are days when I don't even have a cup, I now drink it mostly for the taste rather than the effect. Find what works for you and talk to your doctor about it, note if and how coffee affects you."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"I like to drink a small cup of coffee roughly 3-4 hours after my last dose if I NEED to get more shit done. Caffeine and adderall are broken down by the same shtuff in your body, so if you add some caffeine in around that point the effects will be slightly extended/crash mitigated for a bit.

If you do it at the times you said you’d be completely fine, unable to sleep and your meds the next day would be much less effective, but the Red Bull won’t kill you"

It sucks being a parent of a kid with ADHD and the system only thinking you need meds for 8 hours of work. Almost lost my marriage. Lucky my wife pushed fory son's diagnosis or else my life would be pretty shit RN. Meds have saved my life. No exaggeration. Because of them, I have been able to regulate better. I had to get a second opinion to extend my meds past 8 hours so my wife and kids got a better version ofe and not just work. Meds aren't perfect, but they do give you a window to use strategies you can learn when you get some counselling. The recurring alarms on my phone have been a game changer. That and being able to floss my teeth every day?"
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,smoothies can be a big help! I find I can drink stuff with calories even if my appetite is low on meds. I also found the appetite suppression to be less significant overtime
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"yes they are! but they are different formulations that release in different ways, and doctors don’t always do a good job of explaining the differences. Concerta is one of the longest acting methylphenidate formulations - it has a unique “osmotic release system” that gives 3 peaks of the medication. often when people prescribe “Concerta” and you get a generic you are getting methylphenidate ER which doesn’t have that osmotic release system and can feel really different even at the same dose. Ritalin has both immediate release and long acting forms, but when people say ritalin they usually mean the immediate release. Concerta is designed to feel sort of like taking IR ritalin 3 times a day.

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Ummm. Hard to say this without sounding junkie-ish, but vaping on meds feels amazing. I think it’s due to the extra dopamine, then the extra-EXTRA dopamine you get from the vape. I was an on and off smoker, found it very easy to quit. Then when I got my meds, it’s been impossible to kick. Even when I’m off it (nicotine) for a month or so, I’m still craving it. 
So my advice to med newbies is to quit asap."

My reaction was apparently super rare though and I noticed no affects whatsoever when taking only 10mg less a day. I always like to bring it up because whilst I've tried plenty of meds that affected how I felt, I never knew there could be drugs that could change what you thought about."

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"You might already know this, but untreated ADHD does lead to a higher likelihood of drug abuse, so taking stimulants (in a controlled manner) actually often makes people less likely to abuse drugs than they would be if they weren't taking the stimulants despite the easy access to an abusable drug.

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Huh, I always thought only the amphetamine based meds were classified as stimulants, bit I guess Ritalin is too.

Anyways, the amphetamine/non-amphetamine distinction is what I was referring to with regards to vitamin-c issues, which I thought was equivalent to stimulant and non-stimulant."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,Probably the fact that it’s not amphetamine-based. Or they’re thinking of Strattera.
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"This is kinda what I’ve been struggling with. I take a multivitamin most days that obviously has vitamin C in it, and I usually take it before my Vyvanse, but sometimes it’s just *seconds* before, lol. The issue is that it’s pretty damn hard to tell if it’s actually hindering the stimulation from the meds!

I am kind of careful about eating acidic foods while my meds are still supposed to be working, but obviously sometimes life gets in the way and citric acid and vitamin C come in contact with my gut biome while I’m on amphetamines. Luckily though, the lack of appetite on Vyvanse keeps me from eating *too many* acidic foods anyway, lol.

I guess the best solution for you (and for me, hell I’ve actually given myself a decent idea) is to take your vitamins before bed, when your medication has worn off. That would most likely not affect your medication kicking in the next morning, and after all, we all need vitamin C, lest we get scurvy 🏴‍☠️ 

Overall though, I’m still torn on eating acidic foods like orange juice early in the day, because those are naturally going to be ingested very near to the time you take your medicine. But I think that with a little experimentation and jotting down how you feel each day, acidic foods and supplements aren’t going to be a huge hindrance to your medication routine.

At the end of the day, everyone needs vitamin C, even people prescribed amphetamines, so there‘s really nobody who knows what it’s like to have an amphetamine regimen with no acidic foods involved in their diet at all.

At least nobody who hasn’t died of scurvy!"
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"> Magnesium (it has great benefits but in my case since I have enough in my diet, it made me a little too “not constipated” if you know what I mean so I stopped taking it)

I don't know your life, of course, but you almost certainly aren't getting enough magnesium in your diet. The GI unpleasantness probably doesn't have anything to do with that, it's probably more about the form you were taking the magnesium in. Almost every magnesium supplement you can find in a grocery store (magnesium stearate and magnesium citrate are far and away the most popular, because they're cheap) are not particularly bioavailable, and are basically just laxatives.

&nbsp;

What you want is magnesium a form that your body will absorb. There's a few different ones but magnesium glycinate (or bisglycinate) is generally the best. Most people can take truly heroic amounts of that and not have any GI issues whatsoever (if you try it, do start low and increase slowly, though, as with any new thing)."

You may find that getting ADHD under control makes navigating the world so much easier that anxiety improves, but a side effect of stimulants can be increased anxiety symptoms. 

For me it was a little bit of both. I was on frequently increasing doses of stimulants for years, but have found I'm far more functional taking an SSRI and lower dose of stims."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,">I just had to relearn what hungry feels like

Definitely relate to this, although not actually for ADHD meds. I developed type 2 diabetes earlier this year and the meds I'm on for that have massively lowered how much I want and am able to eat, and it took me a while to realize that I now experienced ""hunger"" as ""mild nausea"" 🙃

Weirdly enough, while my ADHD meds have made hunger as a concept practically cease to exist, it's actually increased how much I'm able to eat. Not back to how much I could eat before the diabetes meds (which is a good thing lol, the lowered appetite has helped me lose about 100 pounds this year, and I could still do with losing another 100 or so), but more than I could otherwise."

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"Well I’ve always had perfect & stable BM.
As soon as I started taking the magnesium it changed, I didn’t make the connection until a month later after being terrified I had IBS all of a sudden 😂

It went back to normal as soon as I stopped & yes I actually do have enough magnesium in my diet. I have spent the past two years researching to be very balanced in my way of eating (I was a drug addict for over a decade & neglecting my health a lot due to being raised in a strict religious cult as a child that left me traumatized ☹️) I have a healthy intake of nuts, spinach, bananas, tofu, beans, yogurt just to name a few that contain high levels of magnesium. I make sure as much as possible that I hit my daily % for everything. I keep a journal of everything I eat because having a healthy body is important to me now.

But you are correct about the kind of magnesium they have in grocery stores. That’s not where I got mine because I don’t buy supplements from there but I definitely wasn’t taking “the right one” & have recently found out about magnesium glycinate.

Thank you for your input ☺️ it’s great advice !"

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"It depends on the thing. With grapefruit specifically, I think it’s best to just avoid it all together on meds. With other citrus, I think it’s more just go light on it. With caffeine, I think it depends on how you react to it, that’s one that varies highly from person to person. If you have a big reaction, avoid it altogether, if you have none, do whatever you’d like, if you have a little bit, avoid it however much you need to."
Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"No idea on the Vitamin C. For caffeine, my personal experience (with armodafinil, haven't tried other stimulants) has been that having caffeine within \~30 minutes of taking my meds, even if it's just a little bit, is not a good time -- the one time I did it, I just felt strange and uncomfortable for a while around an hour after taking it when the medication hit its peak, somewhat similar to my experience with it on the first day I took it. Outside of that time, I haven't had any issues with moderate caffeine intake (most caffeine I've had since starting meds is two 20 oz bottles of Mountain Dew within a few hours of each other)."

Recently diagnosed (26F) and starting Ritalin tomorrow. What do you wish you were told before starting stimulants?,"I'm a master control operator for a broadcast TV station! Basically I'm responsible for the day to day operation of the actual playback system -- my active tasks are mostly making sure that we have the programs that are going to air, that there aren't any major issues either files (either technical glitches or good old fashioned human errors), and making sure that everything is in the right place for our automation system to actually send it to air. It'd be about two hours of work a day if you sat down and did it all at once, but all of the tasks naturally fall into a lot of tiny bite-sized tasks so I can kind of go between tasks as my attention wanders.

The other part of my job is just keeping an eye on the feeds we're sending out to make sure there aren't issues, as well as noting if there are any other issues with the equipment (I actually work in the server room so all the important equipment is in there with me) and letting the engineers know if something's going wrong. Most of the time it'll be one of a handful of recurring issues that I've learned to handle myself, but I've only been there for a bit over a year so there are plenty of issues left to surprise me lol. Still important to let the engineers know there was an issue.

The reason I feel like my ADHD actually works to my advantage is that it's not really feasible for anybody to just have their eyes glued to the monitors for 8 hours straight, so having my attention constantly scattered all over the place helps me to notice quickly if something changes. Before this job I was usually trying to harness my hyperfocus to actually be productive, so it's a neat change of pace to be *avoiding* hyperfocus instead lol."

My doctor failed to explain to me a very important detail about Ritalin dosages,"The label on your prescription bottle will have all the info you need. if you were given 20mg, the label will say something along the lines of ""20mg twice daily or as needed"". That's one pill 2x a day and totaling 40mg. The ""as needed"" portion gives you some wiggle room, however you shouldn't exceed the ""twice daily"" part on the hypothetical pill label. I hope that makes sense. If you're still confused, I recommend reaching out to your pharmacist or your doctor to help you."
My doctor failed to explain to me a very important detail about Ritalin dosages,"Oof...well, you probably would have noticed there was an issue the first time you took 40mg or more in one go. To confirm, yes, 80mg would be the maximum DAILY intake, not maximum per dose. 

My doc prescribes me 60mg IR a day as a standard adult dose. The pills I get are 10mg each, and he's left it to me to work out what works for me in terms of scheduling.

After some trial and error I settled on 10mg per dose, at roughly 3hr intervals. I take my first an hour before I need to get up, and go back to bed. I generally only end up taking 50mg a day unless I'm having a very long day, for various reasons.

I tried 20mg at a time doses and my resting heart rate hit 120 mid-morning. Didn't seem like a good idea. Each pill lasts 4hrs, so the 3hr intervals mean I don't wait for one to run out before I take the next. 

I'd probably make it a 2.5hr interval so I could fit in the 60mg, but I mask at work to protect my chronically ill partner, so that would mean multiple trips outside to safely take my meds, and that just doesn't seem like it would work for me.

When I first started, my doc warned me about taking my last dose too late, but I wasn't having any sleep issues (I rarely have, ever), and I was getting a horrible anxiety drop between dinner and bed when the last pill wore off, so now I'm less fussy about how late I'll take it.

As long as you go slowly with the trial and error, it's a pretty good way to settle on the right dose and schedule. Everyone's needs are different, so following a generic schedule wouldn't be great."
My doctor failed to explain to me a very important detail about Ritalin dosages,"When my GP starts me on any new med, she *always* says something to the effect of “feel it out”. 

It’s just medical-speke for “see how you get on with this, and we’ll make any adjustments as necessary.”

As far as I’m concerned, this is a *good* attitude for any doctor to have. 

It means they’re not dictating how much and  when you should take something, and are going to be open to having to change it. 

What is it about “feel it out” that’s not sitting well with you?"
My doctor failed to explain to me a very important detail about Ritalin dosages,Nah you didn’t pay attention. 
My doctor failed to explain to me a very important detail about Ritalin dosages,Ritalin is twice as weak as Adderall. So taking 30 mg Ritalin twice a day is like taking 15 mg Adderall twice a day. Normal dosing
My doctor failed to explain to me a very important detail about Ritalin dosages,What does the label on your prescription bottle say?
My doctor failed to explain to me a very important detail about Ritalin dosages,"For me I take 20 in the morning and another 20 after lunch to extend the effect to ~21h. But I started with 20, then 20/10, that's probably why she tells you to ""feel it out"" since not everyone responds the same. "
My doctor failed to explain to me a very important detail about Ritalin dosages,"That's bizarre, I am the opposite. I get anxiety on Ritalin but not on Vyvanse. Glad you caught it!   


Word of advice: Read the label on the bottle before reading Reddit innit! That should clearly state your daily dose."
My doctor failed to explain to me a very important detail about Ritalin dosages,80 mg is not actually a true maximum.  It's a recommended maximum. They can prescribe more if needed.
My doctor failed to explain to me a very important detail about Ritalin dosages,Oooof I tried 20mg once. Never again.
My doctor failed to explain to me a very important detail about Ritalin dosages,"i started on ritalin as well a few weeks ago. 10mg twice a day and on my 2nd tablet, i do get the heart palpitations so my doctor asked me to just take half the tablet on my 2nd dose and see how it goes. But im curious does the palpitations stop after a while?"
My doctor failed to explain to me a very important detail about Ritalin dosages,"I am given two 10 mg tables twice daily. 

I break them down to 5 mg and take them 3-4 times a day. This way I get the most out of my day. 

The only exception I do is take an entire 10 mg tablet when I need to do an exam. 

My doctor won’t go higher."
My doctor failed to explain to me a very important detail about Ritalin dosages,"I have a long release version (capsuls) I take my dose in the morning 40mg and it works throughout the day. If needed I could use a short release one in the evening if I need to focus longer but the  version I would need for that isn't really available and therefore more expensive. 

My pharmacist said its best to stick to once a day full dose. It starts to work after 1 to 2 hours and lasts for 8, can be a bit longer or shorter depending on how your body reacts. I go to my neurologist for this. So I had a really good explanation. 

My psychologist recommended this or a psychiatrist because your normal doctor might not know as much about it as them. I already went to a neurologist for my migraines/epilepsy so that choice was easy."

Maybe I will break it up further so I can take a little less but every 3 hrs..."

My doctor failed to explain to me a very important detail about Ritalin dosages,"i’m in france and on ritalin since a bit more than a year, i’m on 20mg a day but it’s like one pill in the morning, they never really spoke to me about a split option, feels like for weeks now it’s barely working, (executive dysfunction being my biggest problem) it also makes more sense to me to have the daily dose split in 2, just like psychologically i feel like i’d spend less time wondering if i can feel the effects through the day if it was a morning / afternoon thing, have you ever been on those one time a day pill and can tell a difference with what you’re doing now ?"
My doctor failed to explain to me a very important detail about Ritalin dosages,Thank you so much for your comment
My doctor failed to explain to me a very important detail about Ritalin dosages,"I think that I would’ve preferred to have a better outline of the limits, you know? As in, feel it out and try something along the lines of X. Basically a more informed “feel it out”, since it’s my first time"

He advised me to lower a medication I was taking and raise the Ritalin dose. Told me to feel it out, maybe try 30mg"
My doctor failed to explain to me a very important detail about Ritalin dosages,"I see, thank you!"
My doctor failed to explain to me a very important detail about Ritalin dosages,"We don’t have bottles here in Brazil. It says the dose in the prescription paper and the meds come in their original boxes. Initially he advised me to take 10mg one or twice a day, but we had an online appointment a few days ago and that’s when he told me to up the dose and feel it out"
My doctor failed to explain to me a very important detail about Ritalin dosages,"Yeah, the second dose made the palpitations worse for me too! I have in general a high resting heart rate, but it got even higher. They only got better after the meds were off."
My doctor failed to explain to me a very important detail about Ritalin dosages,"In Austria the recipes have the dosage written on them and the pharmacies ask if you want the meds labeled. So if you get something new, you can have a label to be sure and if you’ve taken it for some time and are sure how to take it, you can just leave it off."
My doctor failed to explain to me a very important detail about Ritalin dosages,"That’s wild! This stuff specifically is so tightly controlled by the dea. We (pharmacies) can only order so many bottle of each schedule II drug. Right now, McKesson- our distributor- is completely OUT of lisdexamfetamine 60mg from one manufacturer as we have 20+ orders (scripts) waiting for that drug, that we don’t get until the 1st.

ETA: pharmacists are king here. As the doctor knows the body so does the pharmacist know medications. Working in pharma taught me that though. Any questions about meds I’ve had, I’ve asked coworkers. They’ve just had more info readily available that my dr would have to research.

Just wanna say that dosage and how the drug interacts with you is more on the doctor not the pharmacy! Thanks RynnR for that note though, I forgot that."
My doctor failed to explain to me a very important detail about Ritalin dosages,It’s the same in Brazil!
My doctor failed to explain to me a very important detail about Ritalin dosages,"Of course! My first step is reading the label and making sure i'm following that, if i'm still confused I will call my pharmacy or doctor depending on if my issue is on one of their days off. Label clarification tends to go to my pharmacist and everything else (such as self directed titration) goes to my doctor. Just make sure that you have some sort of professional guidance through this, meds can be super confusing."
My doctor failed to explain to me a very important detail about Ritalin dosages,"No, I've never taken the slow release version. From what I've read, it's more commonly prescribed to kids, who can't easily manage a dosage schedule through the day. But I have heard of a lot of people who take the slow release in the morning, then a small booster dose of instant in the afternoon.

My doctor went straight to Ritalin IR, I assume because it makes fine-tuning a dosage simpler. The pills are 10mg each, so you can take 10mg or 20mg at a time, and work out the best way to spread them over the day.

If you feel like you're not getting what you want from your meds, it's always worth having a talk to your doctor about other options. Either a top-up dose of IR in the afternoons, or switching over to IR completely. Or even trying a different medication if it's not doing much for you. If it helps, when I was taking 40mg a day my doctor kept telling me that was a low dose for an adult. I don't know if there's a difference in the impact of 20mg between the instant and slow release versions, but if they have the same impact, you're on a fairly low dose atm. 

I can generally tell when my meds are wearing off - that's when the anxiety spike hits. If I'm lucky, I'm already winding down for bed and I don't notice it as much."
My doctor failed to explain to me a very important detail about Ritalin dosages,Did you ask your doctor for clarification on “feel it out” at the time?
My doctor failed to explain to me a very important detail about Ritalin dosages,Not really. We all have ADHD here. 
My doctor failed to explain to me a very important detail about Ritalin dosages,Ah ok. Call to clarify maybe? Seems like a thing it’s important to get right and your doc would know for sure.
My doctor failed to explain to me a very important detail about Ritalin dosages,"That's a very good solution. In Poland sometimes they'll offer to scribble the dose on the box if you want, but it's not a rule."
My doctor failed to explain to me a very important detail about Ritalin dosages,"Our pharmacists know their shit as well! You can ask them all sorts of questions too, but the dosage is typically decided between you and your doctor. We don't get those rules about refills etc., you can get up to 3 months of meds and that's pretty much it. If you get more depends on your doctor. So sometimes people will get a starting dose of, let's say, 5mg, but the doctor will tell them to up the dose to 10mg or 15mg and see what works best. So when they run out they just get another prescription 🤷🏻‍♀️

We have a system monitoring the prescriptions that all doctors can see, though, so you can't just jump from doctor to doctor and abuse that - they would find out very quickly, and you need specific qualifications as a doctor to prescribe Ritalin. We also don't have Adderall available."
My doctor failed to explain to me a very important detail about Ritalin dosages,"They can 😣, but this has helped me understand things better until he reaches back to me!"

My doctor failed to explain to me a very important detail about Ritalin dosages,"I know this is late, but, you are spot on!! My pharmacist at Walgreens in az has taught me more then several drs have… true story! And as of this morning, I talked with him again abt Ritalin, my daughter was just prescribed it, and he told me some info, not even the psychiatrist told us."
My doctor failed to explain to me a very important detail about Ritalin dosages,"In Poland every doctor can prescribe every medication. They will of course mostly stick to their specialisation, for the patients and their own safety, but if a family doctor wanted to prescribe you ritalin he could even if you weren't prescribed it before. They also sometimes continue prescribing a medication based on a note from a specialist."
My doctor failed to explain to me a very important detail about Ritalin dosages,"Yeah, that's not true. Regular doctors absolutely won't prescribe you controlled substances just because, only in very specific circumstances and if you're lucky. Definitely not if you haven't been prescribed it before. Not sure where you got that information."
My doctor failed to explain to me a very important detail about Ritalin dosages,"If a family doctor was comfortable with diagnosing a person with adhd and prescribing them methylphenidate there is no law to say that they couldn't - that's what I'm saying. Whether treating patients kind of outside your specialisation is ok is a different issue. I'm just stating the fact that they can.

Anywhere you look you will find that every doctor can prescribe every medication - there is no restriction on any doctor to prescribe controlled substances so I don't know where did you learn the opposite. This information is readily available so I don't think I need to provide a source. Family doctors often prescribe benzodiazepines for example which are controlled although not in the same category as methylphenidate."

Ritalin was a game changer,"i love ritalin. it saved my life as well!! unfortunately my psychiatrist thinks i've become too reliant on it, because, surprised surprised, i have trouble functioning when i don't take it!! wow, as if that was my complaint when i first came to her, that I can't function... crazy right?"
Ritalin was a game changer,"I’ve been diagnosed after 24 years. On Ritalin for 4 days now and I kinda feel like I can conquer the world😂 I have never felt better than this. I’ve been diagnosed because of a depression and burnout that just never ended. Also never had an issue with hyperactivity but my mind was hyperactive as fuck🤣 
Everything in my life starts to fall in place😊"
Ritalin was a game changer,"I only recently joined this sub for help in supporting my daughter, who for the first time in 20 years is going without meds due to supply issues. I am shocked at how many there are who, like her, were finally able to have a decent quality of life because of the medication, but face continued stigma trying to ensure an adequate supply to receive it.

I am disappointed to be told by medical professionals 'At least she doesn't need it because she isn't working or going to school.' Duh!  She can't get it so she can't go to work or school right now.

As for her being home, sometimes I come home to dog pee on the floor because she got hyper focused on something and forgot to let him out.

Are there advocacy groups specifically for ADHD? I'm in the US but I'm learning now this is a worldwide concern. I'm willing to put skin in this 'game', just not sure what's already being done."
Ritalin was a game changer,"im glad to finaly see a post about methylphenidate, all i see on this sub is amphetamine, dexamphetamine, adderal and other amphetamine brands completely hate to see it while also having a stigma that methylphenidate is complete garbage, but infact methylphenidate is much more gentle in its side effects and neurotoxicity wheres amphetamines i hear this a lot causes anxiety what a surprise, and even if there is side effects well then try focalin, i personally have opposite side effects on medikinet i feel sleepy, my heartrate drops, bp also, motivation increases general sense of calmness while also having energy, its kinda strange that i feel energized but at the same time sleepy"
Ritalin was a game changer,"
I suspect I have the inattentive type 

If the situation isn’t very simulating i just turn of and hibernate while saying, “ yer, oh right, right , yer”."
Ritalin was a game changer,"There was a study showing saffron to be as effective as Ritalin, if of any interest to anyone"
Ritalin was a game changer,Ritalin has been a game changer for me too. I take a low dose IR and have zero side effects and great benefits.
Ritalin was a game changer,Yeah brother so with me I was basically a crazy hyper little kid could not sit still super impulsive would do things without thinking (little things maybe even big things) so I’ve been on it since I was in 2nd grade fast forward to high school senior year I completely rebelled against the meds now I’m 23 I do hardwood and for the last year I’ve been struggling to get my focus on point so I decided lemme look into my adhd Uk tried adderall tried slot of things finally at the start of this week I got my hands on ritilin la 30 I completely felt a feeling I haven’t felt in ages my life completely is turning around but ritilin comes with a cost fast heart rate meaning it’s over working u lose calories like it’s nothing and ur loss of appetite will run u dry be careful
Ritalin was a game changer,Mine hasn't worked for the past year. No matter which manufacturer I get them from. Thinking about switching to Adderall.
Ritalin was a game changer,"Doctor: sorry but I can’t prescribe you insulin anymore for your diabetes because when you don’t take it, your sugar levels spike, so you must be too reliant on it.  

SMH.  It’s ridiculous how doctors demonize the use of stimulants to treat ADHD."
Ritalin was a game changer,"That’s actually an insane fkn response from a psychiatrist. Too reliant on a medication you need to function? Absurd. Hope you told that psych off for their inappropriate response.

Edit: might as well respond to OP lol. Yes Ritalin for me has been life changing. I’m happy that I do have a supportive psychiatrist and psychologist helping me through the process as I was diagnosed later in life. The combination of stimulants and advice on how to navigate behaviours and habits that medication alone can’t resolve have made me so much more efficient. I’ve evolved."
Ritalin was a game changer,This has got to be the biggest pile of bs I have seen in a while. If you believe this you are literally insane.
Ritalin was a game changer,"Hha yep, lost 20kg since june this year. Also started running so its super important to think about how many calories you get in a day!"
Ritalin was a game changer,"That's one way to increase the sales with the prices that high, I guess 😂"

Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,"Unfortunately, that’s true for all the adhd stimulant meds. While they can help immensely at times, they don’t eliminate an adhd person’s tendency to procrastinate, or adhd task paralysis. I’ve found that they’re a great helper to get you to do stuff and stay on task ONCE you have forced yourself to start doing whatever stuff you need to do, but you still have to somehow force yourself to start."
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,"For me, Ritalin didn't do shit lmao. It just made me really calm. My doctor prescribed to me Strattera instead. It's a non-stimulant, meaning there's less risks of it worsening my anxiety, and it has long-term effectiveness as well. I'm currently figuring out the dosage, but I'm slowly starting to see tasks not so overwhelming as I did before, and I'm back at being creative and motivated again.

 Talk to your doctor about this. Maybe you need something a little less short term"
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,"Ritalin isn't gonna suddenly motivate you to do stuff you had no interest in doing. It helps with focus and get things done, but if were not intending to do it in the first place, you have other problems."
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,"Medication is a tool, not a cure. 

You need to make changes in your routines .. and they are conditioned routines to help yourself along with actually starting the thing you want to achieve when you take your medication .

It may also mean that Methylphenidateis not the right medication for you . Lisdexamfetamine proved to me more effective with me in combination with dexamfetamine as required and Guanfacine a couple of hours before bed . 

Different people react different …. But any problematic behaviours like doom scrolling for example would need to stop to give you a better chance"
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,"Ritalin and vyvanse gave me focus if I could get off the lounge and get myself started and they quietened the chaos in my head with no side effects. it was an improvement but not the best for me.
On dex, I can think of what I want to do, and get up and do it (most of the time). Boring stuff is still a struggle but my house no longer looks like a junk yard and I can usually get back on top of things within a few days of spiralling. 
Meds are trial and error. My psych suggested I trial a few meds to see which works best for me. Ask your doc to try something else."
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,been there i just got diagnosed a year ago and im FINALLY on meds that are working for me (adderall 30mg xr) it was definitely frustrating in the beginning when some meds would almost put me to sleep
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,"Same issue with Ritalin.

You gotta get into the mindset of wanting to do work in order for it to be effective.

I found that if I was browsing social media or playing a game while waiting for the meds to kick in, the meds sometimes make it harder to get out of the zone.

My psych made me realize that I gotta use it as a tool to break my old bad habits and learn new ones. Don't be too hard on yourself, trying to unlearn 24 years of bad habit is not easy but the meds will help a lot for when you want to make new good habits."
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,"I highly recommend the Routinery app. It talks you through a task. For example, I procrastinate on my nightly routine because it takes forever and I'd rather play video games than go through my stupid nightly routine. So when I'm ready to do a task or feeling like oh God it's midnight, I need to sleep, I open the app, start the routine and it starts a timer for each task and gives a verbal reminder as you go through it. The hardest part is getting started."
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,"I was told and firmly believe now that my medicine wasn’t a pill that was going to cure me it was going to allow me to play on the same playing field using the same tools other people do.

BUT

If you are feeling nothing at all it just may not be the right one for you.  I switched from Ritalin to adderal and it was a big difference.  Ritalin worked at first but then I was at max with it doing absolutely nothing and I felt like it made it worse because I had a little taste haha.  Everything is fine now but the fact remains that it won’t get rid of procrastination but allow us access to the same field everyone else is on."
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,I would give another stimulant a try. Adderall really helps me get off my butt and get shit done.
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,"For me, one of my biggest problems was not being able to start working on things that I wanted to work on. So for example, I wanted to start on a project for work that I needed to figure out, and I almost physically couldn't open excel to start working on it. Now with medication, I can get over that hurdle to start things that I want to work on. The problem is, It doesn't do anything to help me start things I don't want to work on, so I still procrastinate."
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,I'm audhd. My executive paralysis didn't improve with stimulants but it got way better with low dose naltrexone.
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,"Meds don’t cure ADHD, they make it easier to operate. You still have to work on the things that are holding you back."
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,Bupropion really helps me with executive function and avoiding procrastination.  Adderrall type meds help me reduce anxiety and find some satisfaction in finishing tasks. Ritalin type meds didn’t help.
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,"Ritalin didn't do shit for me. Adderall XR helps though. 

It's not a magic cure-all though. You still have to use tools and tricks to relearn good habits to make sure you can focus on the things that should be focused on, otherwise you'll find yourself extremely productive on the wrong things."
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,"I had a similar experience.

I am extremely hyperactive and like to procrastinate a lot. 

When i first started meds they seemed like they were working and i was getting my tasks done. But in reality its just a placebo effect and you are still left to your own will. Procrastination is a habit and you have to defeat it.
Meds just make it easier to defeat it for ADHD people.

Don't get me wrong meds do work and they saved my life but they are just a tool. They just stop me from jumping and running around unconsciously.
You still need extreme hard work to function like a normal being. At least this was my case 🤷‍♂️"
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,"You might benefit from goal management training with a good coach. Some of them are no better than snake oil salesmen and will just take your money without helping at all, but good ones do exist. You need to settle on a daily or weekly routine, your meds will help you with your routines but they won't build those routines for you. A GMT coach will also not build those routines for you, but they will help you do it on your own."
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,This is why I still find myself more productive by going to the office or a public location to work. I need to feel “supervised” in a sense so that I’m forced to work.
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,Ive combined it with Wellbutrin and works better. Talk to your doctor about it.
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,"Hi! 28F and  recently diagnosed here. It's my second day on Ritalin and I'm taking 10mg daily. I took it and within the 1st hour, I felt groggy. After that I felt normal, less mistakes at work though. I had trouble sleeping at night. Ended up sleeping at 2am then taking multiple 1hr naps until 12nn. I also felt irritated in the morning. Honestly, don't know how to feel about the meds yet."
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,"Meds don't fix things.  In the same way that you can give a person a shovel but it won't dig for them.  Meds are like 20-30% of the solution for ADHD, exercise is another 10-20%, and knowledge + effort make up the remaining 50-60%.

Beyond, if you've got a shit mindset or bad self beliefs they can prevent anything from fixing your problems.  If you've got a good mindset/internal monologue, then everything in your life will be more effective.  So if you would describe yourself as a pessimist, you need to study learned optimism/growth mindset/positive self talk/reframing negative thoughts, which are all part of CBT."
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,"It’s because you hate your job bro. Ritalin only fix your ability to focus, it doesn’t fix your shitty job

You finally got the ability to do things you want to do. Now it’s time to answer what exactly you want to do"
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,"The meds simply help you overcome the paralysis when trying to get yourself to do something but just can't.

But if you have no plans to actually do the thing in the first place it won't help. You have to plan to do things and force yourself to do them, the meds will simply make that process a lot easier/possible."
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,Can try adderall  and see how that affects you.
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,"There are many components to ADHD and to how to live with it.  

It's a bundle of messy things, medication helps an aspect of it, but it's not sufficient.  

Think of having ADHD as needing glasses, you struggled seeing for your whole life and you managed the best you could.  
Now glasses help you see better, but they don't give you any additional capability.  

Habit setting, strutting your workflow(s) and overall organizing your daily life.  
Those are things made easier by medication, but if there's no a support structure build day over day they're still hard and burdening.  

The next step now is to create structures to unburden yourself, medication takes us over an the hump and enables us to build the stairs to get over the next one."
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,Meds won't help you change things about you unless you want them to change. What medication does is help you focus and makes it easier to get started on things
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,Meds dont fix behavior
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,"Yep, that's also my experience"
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,Thanks for reminding me I actually have to get started.
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,"Yeah, I've also found that it's not a magic pill I take and then things magically get done. I need to ensure I'm in the right mindset to actually get things done, or I'll just be extra focused on wtv distraction I chose (phone, or wtv other thing)"
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,Yes it doesn't fix everything and some of the other benefits fade.  Fortunately it still helps long term but there is still stuff we either have to work on or just accept.
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,100% agree.
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,Not sure this is true. Many on this thread who describe consistent benefit.  It seems highly variable.  I just started it after years on strattera.  It’s not giving me much shift and i plan to talk to dr about combining it w strattera which was also partially effective.  Strattera has the benefit of building up in your system.   You may need other meds or combos
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,I tried straterra and am glad it works for you! I was on for 6 weeks but the general malaise/low-grade nausea never went away so I stopped.   Back on foclin xr.
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,"I started Strattera on 4/12. Felt the effects and side effects around day 4. How long have you taken it for? If it has been longer than 4-6 weeks, did you see anymore improvements? I am at 40mg being 6 foot 180 LB male."
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,[deleted]
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,What kind of other problems?
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,"Did it help you stick to routines better, when you started taking your meds?"
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,"Another thing I've tried is breaking down a task into the tiniest possible parts. Need to do homework? Take the homework out of your bag. Then get a snack to reward yourself. Need to clean your room? Sit on the bed and look around for all the small garbage that can fit in your hand. Task initiation is hardest when we build up the thing into a huge dreaded monster. Take that task, hit it with a metaphorical hammer, then pick up the tiniest pieces first. It seems silly but it works - for me at least."
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,"I'm the same, but I still can't do the things I like either. And I'm someone that, for example, really loves her job. Not sure the meds aren't working, as they are working on different points, but procrastination is definitely not one of them.. I feel like it actually got worse instead of better."
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,"It's not a habit, it's a symptom."
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,Do you have any tips for finding a good coach? I've been looking into it for a while now but it seems almost all of them are full of BS.
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,"Same experience here, I don't notice any real improvement in my work but I definitely stay up late as hell and pay for it in the morning."
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,meds is more like 50-60% lol
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,I don’t feel like you understand the nature of an executive function disorder
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,That's not true for everyone. I love my job and still procrastinate.
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,Yup we just all need to stop being so lazy.
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,Yeah I make myself start working on a task first before I take my meds and tell myself that when it hits I’ll be focused and won’t realize- works most of the the time but sometimes I still forget I’m supposed to be doing something
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,"It is true - read people’s experiences from the various adhd subreddits for people who have taken or take adhd stimulants. I’ve taken adhd stimulants for more than 20 years now, and have tried all the various kinds. They have helped me immensely in certain ways, but they don’t cure or eliminate adhd tasks paralysis, or difficulty starting tasks (even ones you WANT to do). You still have to somehow force yourself to start. The meds aren’t a miracle. Heck, I’ve taken my adhd stimulant meds today and they’re definitely working but it’s already 4:30pm and I haven’t been able to start any of the stuff I really need to do today (laundry, cleaning, job searching, etc.). I’ve been stuck on Reddit and Twitter all day due to adhd task paralysis. 

Oh and for what it’s worth I take both adhd stimulant meds and Strattera. I don’t really notice Strattera doing anything additional but my doc is very enthusiastic about combining the two and it doesn’t seem to hurt so I take it in addition to my stimulants."
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,It's so interesting how different our bodies are when you think about it
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,"I'm 5""8 and I weigh around 175 lbs. I don't exactly remember when I started taking it, but it was probably like September or October of last year... I recently increased to 50mg, and I have the possibility to increase to 60 if it's not enough. It's been almost 3 weeks since the increase, and I'm starting to be a little more stable. A little more disciplined and motivated, a little calmer, but I know it's just beginning it's effect."
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,">I only tried ritalin for 4 days but for me it melted any reason to not do task X or Y. No mountain of obstructions or reasons not to do it, but was instantly able to start and finish it, even tasks I couldn't care for.

Did only Ritalin help you with this, or has there been another stimulant that also helped you do boring tasks? Currently on Vyvanse 50 mg and I still find myself not able to push through boring math homework; constantly wanting to do unproductive yet stimulating tasks."
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,"Tbh, I don't know."
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,"Idk if you use it already but I highly recommend 
Goblin tools , you put in a task , like “clean my room” and it will break it down into as many steps as you want. Or you can put in 10 things you need to do and it will organize it for you. 

Plus it has a recipe builder !"
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,It is definitely a habit. All people with or without ADHD can procrastinate.
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,"I know of three of them (two of which specialize in couching adhd people) that have fantastic reputations, and know people personally that have met them, but unfortunately I doubt very much they will be much use to you, since I live on an island with a tiny population in the middle of the Atlantic. If you ever move to Iceland I'll be happy to give you their names and business numbers, but otherwise the only advice I can give is to read reviews and talk to people who have benefited from coaching in your area"
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,"Honestly like if you say ""I'm struggling, do you have any tips?"" The response is 95% ""are you on meds? Because nothing else is going to work unless you're on meds"". "
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,"If meds are 50-60% of the solution for you, great, it likely means you've already got good adaptations and coping mechanisms that help address your condition so those things appear less important to you.  I think most people with ADHD do not have those adaptations and coping mechanisms to a level where meds are 50-60% of the solution for them.  Everyone is going to have different percentages based on their own experiences that makes sense to them."
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,"Your comment is unproductive and rude, but if that's how you approach the world, I can see why you would react poorly to my post about mindset."
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,Long acting meds are good for that.
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,I've seen plenty of people who say I helps hugely with task paralysis.
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,[deleted]
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,"And all people can have difficulty maintaining attention and can be impulsive sometimes. That doesn't mean those things aren't adhd symptoms. If it's not a big one for you that's great, it is for others though and it's not a habit you can train yourself out of."
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,"We all need to work on ourselves and our mindsets ADHD or not.  It’s not only people w ADHD who procrastinate, have bad habits etc.  but what differentiates us is executive function deficit.  Meds treat the symptom of executive function deficit, which IS the disorder.  The rest is true for us and everyone else.  Do we need to do all the other things in life that make people functional?  Yes obviously.  But i do get tired of the notion that we just haven’t worked on ourselves hard enough which i feel is implyed in your POV."
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,I take long acting meds still not enough :/ but this method works for me right now
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,So have i.  Obviously it isn’t a cure or a magic wand.
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,"Thanks for your reply! I’ll try and see if there’s a pattern to when it pushes me more, or less. The calmness/quiet brain effect doesn’t really push me. I’ve been wondering if 50 is too high, since I get so sleepy, sluggish and paralyzed feeling after 3-4h (didn’t have this issue with lower doses, at least not like this), so I’m gonna try lowering to 40, or maybe 30 in the morning and 20 at lunch. 

I wish I had the same effect as how you described Ritalin though. Idk, the effect is just a bit too relaxing or something. And on lower doses it only lasted 6-7h. Maybe I’ll eventually have to ask to try a methylphenidate-based one, or just instant release Elvanse (Attentin). Sadly we don’t have Adderall here in Scandinavia. :("
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,"I never said it wasn't a symptom. It can be.
But procrastinating is a habit. Even if you are leaned to it genetically. It is a habit. Meds won't magically fix you."
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,"You implied it wasn't a symptom. And it's not a habit. Sad to hear meds don't help with some of the most difficult adhd symptoms, but it's not something you can talk yourself out of either. "
Ritalin did not fix my procrastination,Meds do help with symptoms. That’s the whole point of meds. Just hard to find right one and right dosage
Ritalin doesn't do much. I'm start to doubt if I even have ADHD.,"Your body is unique, as are your needs.

Ritalin doesn't do much. I'm start to doubt if I even have ADHD.,Is it the first medication you’ve tried? It can be a lot of trial and error in the beginning. You may need to adjust your dose or try a new medication entirely. Ritalin did nothing for me personally but other medications helped a lot.
Ritalin doesn't do much. I'm start to doubt if I even have ADHD.,"If I'm remembering correctly from how it was explained to me, methylphenidate is the starter medication for most/many doctors because of its efficacy in children. Basically, it's considered responsible practice to start with it before trying other medications. So if you don't get positive results after titrating the doses, you can try something else. 
 
Methylphenidate did nothing useful for me (but it did make me shart myself for the first time!) and any detectable impacts (brain fog, appetite suppression) were gone by day 3 or 4, so after titration, we were able to try other medications that wound up working better. I actually now take a combination of up to 3 meds that treat different aspects, and even then if my sleep is trash I don't see the impact as clearly. It took around a year of tweaking things to get to that outcome. 


Bodies and brains all react differently, so it doesn't mean you don't have ADHD. 


I compare it in my mind to autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis. From my understanding, most patients are required to start treatment with methotrexate, and if it doesn't improve symptoms, they then move on to biologics. And there are a ton of different biologics and patients with the same disease react differently to different medications--it doesn't mean they don't have the autoimmune disorder."
Ritalin doesn't do much. I'm start to doubt if I even have ADHD.,"I've never been prescribed medication, however I was listening to an ADHD related podcast a couple of days ago. One of the people on there was talking about how he was prescribed ritalin and it did nothing for him. When he went back to his doctors to continue his titration, his doctor compared the before and after test results and they were worlds apart. It turned out it did affect him, he just didn't realise it. 

I'm not saying this is the case for you, but you're not alone."
Ritalin doesn't do much. I'm start to doubt if I even have ADHD.,"If it's not working for you, have a chat with your doc and see if you can switch up meds. Different meds work differently for different people. 

I can say that for me, my generic adderall isn't a cure-all. I still have to fight being distracted, still have to use accommodations I've built up for me to be successful, but it does take the edge off and help. 

Early on it was much more obvious the impact that it was having, but that's become my 'baseline' now so it doesn't feel like it helps as much because it's my new normal. But when I go off my meds for a day or two, hooo boy, it's a huge reminder of how much it's doing for me. 

But yeah, talk to your doc. Maybe you can try some different mediciations to see if there's a better fit for you."
Ritalin doesn't do much. I'm start to doubt if I even have ADHD.,"The Dr will look for specific side effects, with the Ritalin, even though it didn't work for you.  
Someone who does not need these sort of meds, will have a different reaction than someone who does."

When you say it didn't work, did you not feel stimulated at all? Or you just didn't feel focused? I recently started ritalin and it seems to get the desired effect, I have to take a dose that is just too much stimulation. Not sure if that means I don't really have ADHD or what. There is a very tight sweet spot where it works as I had hoped, but it's hard to hit it. Wondering if I should ask my Dr. to let me try something else (adderall)."
Ritalin doesn't do much. I'm start to doubt if I even have ADHD.,"I’ve just recently started taking ritalin too (2 weeks in) and haven’t noticed a single difference besides appetite suppression & then a massive crash after a couple hours where I can’t stop yawning and can barely keep my eyes open (but then I can’t sleep at night 🙄) I was started on 10mg tablets once a day, I upped this myself to twice a day with doctors permission after a few days- since then I decided to start taking 2 in the morning and 2 again a few hours later and I’m just not feeling like it’s working the way it should be. Same feeling as you, no focus, easily distracted, procrastination, executive dysfunction etc. I’ve always had a high tolerance for all drugs- prescription and otherwise 👀So I wonder if this could be why?
My doctor said he will start me on dextroamphetamine in a few more weeks if I’m still not experiencing the desired effect which I expect will happen. 
Perhaps you could suggest a medication switch to Dex instead as well? A few friends I’ve spoken to who are medicated for ADHD said they had the same experience with Ritalin but had massive improvement once they switched to dex."
Ritalin doesn't do much. I'm start to doubt if I even have ADHD.,"I will, thank you."
Ritalin doesn't do much. I'm start to doubt if I even have ADHD.,"Yes, it is the first medication I'm trying. 
Thank you for the feedback and sharing your experience."
Ritalin doesn't do much. I'm start to doubt if I even have ADHD.,"> It turned out it did affect him, he just didn't realise it.

So I need a way to measure it... Hmmm..."
Ritalin doesn't do much. I'm start to doubt if I even have ADHD.,"I will talk to my doctor after this prescription trial's is done.

Thank you very much for your advice."
Ritalin doesn't do much. I'm start to doubt if I even have ADHD.,"When you say it didn't work, did you not feel stimulated at all?  Or you just didn't feel focused?  I recently started ritalin and it seems to get the desired effect, I have to take a dose that is just too much stimulation.  Not sure if that means I don't really have ADHD or what.  There is a very tight sweet spot where it works as I had hoped, but it's hard to hit it.  Wondering if I should ask my Dr. to let me try something else (adderall)."
Ritalin doesn't do much. I'm start to doubt if I even have ADHD.,"I just generally felt anxiety and it didn’t motivate me to do things that I usually struggle to do (task initiation, executive function) …"
Ritalin doesn't do much. I'm start to doubt if I even have ADHD.,"Doctor couldn't prescribe any other meds.


I gave up on psychiatry, trying meditation, psychotherapy and nutrient supplementation, nothing works much."
Ritalin doesn't do much. I'm start to doubt if I even have ADHD.,"Say you did the test, and it showed it was affecting you.... but it's still just as hard to do all the things you need to do. You're not taking it to get better at the test, you're taking it to improve your life, and your life's not improving. If you're still late with work then it's not doing what you need it to do."
Ritalin doesn't do much. I'm start to doubt if I even have ADHD.,"I don't think I said that it didn't work -- it's just less obvious what it's doing for me when I'm regularly on meds.

It's absolutely making a difference -- I just don't think meds will ever get me to 100% ""normal"". It's just a tool in the tool belt to help me cope with having ADHD in a non-ADHD world."
Ritalin doesn't do much. I'm start to doubt if I even have ADHD.,Ohh I’m sorry to hear- that’s so unfortunate :( it does take a long time to find what medications work and what dose. I hope you find something soon!
Ritalin doesn't do much. I'm start to doubt if I even have ADHD.,"Well he couldn't prescribe anything in my country.

He got the idea to try Modafinil with a sleep doctor, which I actually already rarely use in emergencies (illegally, safe doses), so I already know it doesn't really resolve the main issue. :')

I do want to get a full cognitive evaluation in a public hospital eventually but it takes months to get an appointment.

See, considering you got some effects but not the right one, I suspect taking more won't really fix the situation for you.

I'm not a psychiatrist. However, I have friends with ADHD who tried it : it works for them as soon as they have noticeable effects.

Hopefully your drug tolerance hypothesis is correct and 20-40 mg will fix it. But if at 50 mg you still got nothing AND you have bad side effects (I got anxiety) I would stop.

Oh, and by the way, methylphenidate is fast acting. Usually it shouldn't take consistent doses for weeks for it to work. It should be pretty apparent if the dose is right after a week or two.

Withdrawal was horrible for me, especially with my energy levels."

"Ritalin makes me more “hyper”, is this normal? ","First off: I'm not a doctor, but I've been taking the same type of stimulant as you for years.

* Your described reaction to the meds feels familiar to me. I don't see them as a reason to doubt a diagnosis.

* Although Ritalin is not meant to give you a euphoric mood, that's not an uncommon side effect. It might however be an indicator that the dosage might perhaps be too high.

* Many people experience a rebound phase when their Ritalin wears off. In that time symptoms may be heightened. I personally find that very annoying, but it's rather normal. In that time I have troubles with making decision, forming complete and grammatically correct sentences etc."
"Ritalin makes me more “hyper”, is this normal? ","So, I don't take Ritalin but Medikinet (methylphenidate) and my experience is similar I think. However, I wouldn't describe it as feeling hyper. It's more like that without meds I don't get anything done because I'm overwhelmed, everything seems so complicated and since I can't prioritize tasks properly I end up with some kind of decision paralysis and end up doing nothing. With meds I can prioritize tasks, they seem less complicated and I get things done. I do have a slight mood increase as soon as the meds start working, but I feel like that's because they do help with my anxiety quite a bit. I don't get caught in negative thought spirals and feel less on edge. I don't lose track of time, but tbh I never was able to keep track of it to begin with"
"Ritalin makes me more “hyper”, is this normal? ","Obligatory not a mental health professional but I think it's due to how ADHD manifests differently in people.


""I get a rush of motivation from within, in a sense where I’ll be in a decent mood even if I’m doing something dull. The dreadful feeling of doing simple tasks goes away for a few hours and I find myself losing track of time because I’m so fixated on getting things done.""


⬆️ This seems pretty spot on for medicated ADHD to me, because ADHD's root cause is executive dysfunction in that our brains just don't regularly create the neurochemicals we need to just DO things. Hence, doing the simplest tasks can sometimes just feel like absolute hell, and we just become paralyzed.



Once we have our meds, we can actually start doing things and being ""productive"" and ""hyper""."
"Ritalin makes me more “hyper”, is this normal? ","I think I understand what you mean because I’ve felt that myself but I think I just feel energized and awake and clear, outgoing."
"Ritalin makes me more “hyper”, is this normal? ","I am experiencing excactly what you describe here, but i also get very easily angry and i talk a lot, and today i drank a coffee and now i am extremely anxious:/ i use 30mg teva so it is a pretty low dose"
"Ritalin makes me more “hyper”, is this normal? ","This is me exactly on ritalin. I have add rather than adhd (some would argue its the same thing) but I notice the hyperactivity that is usually only noticeable in my head is now visible on the outside and my brain is chill. I can easily start tasks and keep doing them until they're done and if I do them neatly I even enjoy them. 

While without meds I'd dread starting and I would find it really hard to continue without getting distracted. Normally I really struggle with executive dysfunction but when I take ritalin I feel like I can handle the world (at least for 8 hours or so). My (social) anxiety is also way less when I take my ritalin so that's really nice."
"Ritalin makes me more “hyper”, is this normal? ","Glad to see this thread. I have the same problem. I feel like I am on drugs, even with a lower dosage (I mean, I am, but you get what I mean). I was wondering if there are alternatives to ritalin for this reason."
"Ritalin makes me more “hyper”, is this normal? ","Being on ritalin actually makes me feel like doing shit. Makes me more social, when otherwise, I don't wanna talk to anyone. 
I have alot of positive energy, wanna get outta & do things. My social circle isn't even a circle, I have a few friendly acquaintances & maybe one real friend (aside from my boyfriend). This might sound dramatic or weird, but Ritalin makes me feel more ""human "".......like what life must be like for those ""normal people."""
"Ritalin makes me more “hyper”, is this normal? ","I used Ritalin and Concerta for my attention deficit for 1 year. During that time, I had times when I was emotionally depressed, there were times when I was unnecessarily hyperactive, sometimes I had nervous breakdowns and many times crying fits, and sometimes (of my own volition) I took an empty stomach and overdose, the drug effect, It gives you headache and you don't know what You're doing,the drug was driving you.the Side effects are really bad. I fought 10-15 times that year and I lost 15 kilograms, I couldn't eat even if I wanted to, and when I first used it, it made me so angry and antisocial that I used a drug called Zedprex, which is like an antidepressant. It secretes the happiness hormone or something.



and since its raw material is narcotic, it can cause addiction, do not take too much dose at ritalin or concerta like me.

And now, with my own efforts, I have reduced the nervous breakdowns, but I am still having them, and the crying spells and asociality are still there, but it is a problem I have, the medication was only suppressing it was getting worse, and now it has been 1 year since the treatment ended, my attention deficit is gone, so the drug is good for ADHD. It works, but it has many side effects (there is a paper that says the side effects of the drug, read it, I had almost half of the ones on that paper)"
"Ritalin makes me more “hyper”, is this normal? ",I just started taking Ritalin yhis week and am still at a low dose (bumping up to 10mg next week) and those first couple of days the rebound phase was absolutely noticeable. It's nice to hear that it's normal because I was concerned.
"Ritalin makes me more “hyper”, is this normal? ","""Many people experience a rebound phase when their Ritalin wears off. In that time symptoms may be heightened.

Thank you!! 
Experienced exactly this yesterday and wondered. Just starting meds."
"Ritalin makes me more “hyper”, is this normal? ","starting taking medikinet last week and its weird. sometimes I am more hyper but I get ""normal"" after taking a 2nd dosage in the noon. Maybe too low stimulation possible as well? 

And I can focus a bit more but still cannot focus on the right tasks. Guess thats maybe not an adhd issue but rather me with no discipline."

Ritalin Changed my life,"I really relate to the part about  not being able to read anymore. I haven't read a book in years, and I used to love to read. I just can't focus long enough. I keep re-reading the same paragraph over and over because my mind keeps wandering, and then giving up, because after reading it 10 times, I still have no idea what I just read."
Ritalin Changed my life,It’s underrated how much of the benefit of meds is (as I’d describe it) an ability to think my way out of “thinking too much” rather than just feeling stuck thinking too much
Ritalin Changed my life,"Congratulations!

Also, can I ask how much mg of Ritalin do you got? My psychiatrist prescribed me 10mgx2 of Ritalin twice a day (a total of 40mg/day), and I only noticed like 10-15% improvement in my focus."
Ritalin Changed my life,Anybody here find ritalin (methaphendate) to work when multiple amphetamine products did not have much effect? I've been struggling for the past 2 years with different ssri & different dosages of amphetamines with very little no change. My doctor refuses to even try methaphendate under the assumption that amphetamine is stronger and didn't do anything. He basically told me to just learn to deal with it.
Ritalin Changed my life,"how long have you been taking it ? it was kinda of a revelation for me too. all those things i thought were unrelated and just my quirkiness, or that i needed to work on... nada !! all gone."
Ritalin Changed my life,"I'm so happy you have found a diagnosis and medication that works for you. I think this is the thing that I don't get about this, and I experienced it myself with an incorrect diagnosis and the wrong medications...

Why do doctors put you on medication for years that clearly has little to no positive effects, yet the side effects are utterly terrible? And then some will even mix in more than one medication. How would you even know which one is working?

Some of it is on us as patients to say something, but I also know that back then my mental state was not in place to advocate strongly for myself, plus I had no idea what I was suffering from beyond basic depressive symptoms. 

And you are absolutely right, knowing your body is correct. If all you get from medications are nasty side effects, then it is not right for you. And also the unfortunate part is like many other people, I had to both figure out and research my own correct diagnosis, as my medical practitioners never figured it out. 

You should also know the bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder are two very common misdiagnosis for people that have ADHD. More so even with women."
Ritalin Changed my life,"I legit don't care about my weight as long as the voices in my head would just shut up. I don't need ten thousand ideas going on at once, I certainly do not need to feel overwhelmed by everything in my life.

Ritalin Changed my life,I'm so happy for you!
Ritalin Changed my life,"My doctor told me to get a diagnosis before she would prescribe me meds, which I understand. What's frustrating for me, I don't have a license, my husband is active duty army, and the closest ADHD specialist is a whole town over. Just thinking of making the phone call, and telling my husband when and where the appointment is, to deliberating on whether I want to do a full write up of what all I've experienced that leads me to think ADHD, then having to WAIT for the appointment. I just, it's so hard to get that ball rolling. So good on you for getting meds that finally work. I want to avoid stimulants until I know the other stuff does/doesn't help me, since I'm on Wellbutrin and it kind of helps with some of it. If I have to do a stimulant though, I want to try Ritalin first. It works similarly to Wellbutrin, and and Wellbutrin is the only antidepressant that's done anything aside from put me behind six feet of glass from the world."
Ritalin Changed my life,Dude ! I got Vyvanse today am I'm this way too! No racing thoughts! No depression! I'm free! I really hope this lasts..I'm so glad a doctor took a chance and believed in me

Ritalin Changed my life,"I relate to this so much! My family and I have always suspected I was autistic and I was diagnosed (finally, at age 21) at the beginning of this year. Because adhd is often a comorbidity with autism, I had always thought maybe I had that too. I’ve struggled with intrusive thoughts, struggling to focus etc and after years of being on SSRIs that never seemed to go away. But at the beginning of this year I found a new psychiatrist and we discussed potential adhd. We did a couple tests and determined that’s what it was, and I was prescribed Ritalin. I definitely noticed a big change! I’ve noticed it even more recently, because I’ve been without it for over a week now and the racing thoughts are SO MUCH WORSE. I never realized how bad they were until now. It makes sense now why my anxiety is always so intense with seemingly no direct cause. And comparatively, I also used to be a big reader, but stopped. Recently I’ve been reading more again and it’s so much easier. Ritalin has definitely made such a positive impact on my life, it’s amazing! I’m so happy that is been helping you as well.

Ritalin Changed my life,congratulations 🎊
Ritalin Changed my life,Did you try Strattera? Did you notice any effects?
Ritalin Changed my life,This has made me so happy. I’m glad somebody finally listened to you
Ritalin Changed my life,So proud of you! I’m happy that you found something that works for you and makes your life livable.
Ritalin Changed my life,"So happy for you and that you finally got the right diagnosis and something that works <3  
What you wrote with being depressed and anxious and getting in trouble in school reminds  
me of me (and my grandpa on my mother's side is bipolar, for example).   


So I'm glad I - despite being a girl and all that - got diagnosed with ADHD at 10 (it was  
apparent way before that already, like in pre-school and kindergarten and for one my  
brothers also) and not with BP or BPD even x-x  


I for my part haven't been medicated since 17 years or smth. Got Medikinet back then, but  
the crash and some side effects and extreme weight loss made it impossible to stay on it and  
my mom and I decided to quit my meds. Then we forgot about ADHD, believing it's no big  
deal, not knowing the symptoms AND that I will prolly grow out of it.  


Surprise, my ADHD etc. got worse the older I got (despite some coping mechanisms of which  
some gave me depression, dissociation issues occassionally, being deeply unsatisfied with  
myself and more since I always blamed me and why I just can't do better in every area of  
my life, esp. now with almost 28 T-T)  


In any case, so glad and happy for you and hope I cna get help this year also <3 And it   
sucks so much and is so dangerous when therapists and all that just want to throw a   
certain diagnosis and meds at one.   


My bipolar grandpa, for example, kind of lost all life and all that with his bipolar medication  
and had ADHD symptoms back then also, according to my mom. So I wouldn't be surprised   
if he has both and that only treating the BP1 kind of wrecks him. But until I get treatment  
myself, I can't help advocate for him. I hope I'll get treatment before this stuff ends him x-x"
Ritalin Changed my life,"Maaaan, I'm so happy for you.  Way to fight!"
Ritalin Changed my life,"Hello friend,
How long was your diagnose? My doctor prescribed me Ritalin as well and it worked amazingly, but i am afraid of developing tolerance. What is your experience?"
Ritalin Changed my life,"i just got prescribed ritalin and i’m on zoloft right now as well for my really bad anxiety, just got diagnosed with ADHD at 22 years old since my parents “don’t believe in medication” so i never received treatment or therapy. i’m so glad that this has worked so well for you and i hope the same for myself when i start taking it tomorrow! :)"
Ritalin Changed my life,How did you convince him about trying it ? As most drs are extremely cautious cos of the people who ruined it by abusing or selling it
Ritalin Changed my life,"This is exactly my story, Im not prescribed any stimulants yet but I’m telling my doctor that Ritalin should be good for me since I’m Bipolar. I’ve also gained weight and I’m excited to lose some."

Ritalin Changed my life,"Tell a Porsche with no N gear it’s just gotta fight the urge to accelerate.

Ritalin Changed my life,"As a child I read voraciously. This slowed down a lot in my late teens and through most of my 20s, to the point where I just stopped reading for pleasure at all.

That all completely changed about 3 years ago when I started listening to audiobooks. I no longer have to carve out time to 'read' - it's something I can do alongside other unstimulating tasks like cleaning, walking to the shops, cooking etc.

These days I look forward to those tasks because it means I can get back to my book. I enjoy some so much that I buy a print copy to actually read and it's much easier to motivate myself for it because I'm already engaged in the audio version. 

Lord of the Rings, the Dune series, the Foundation series, the Commonwealth saga, Terry Pratchett - all things I regretted never reading and now I've ploughed through them all. Probably consumed more books in the last 3 years than I did in the preceding 10. And this was all before I started looking into an ADHD assessment - I was only diagnosed and prescribed medication a month ago!

I don't like shilling for Amazon but Audible has been a godsend. Many audiobooks even sync with their Kindle equivalent so I never lose my place.

Might be an option for you."
Ritalin Changed my life,"I'm almost 28 and got into reading again a while ago, but yeah, not even nearly as much as  
I did as a kid. I can focus and remember what I read and imagine the stuff happening and  
all that, but I get bored so easily, even if I WANT to keep reading. Like, nowadays, stuff has  
to immensely hook me for me to be able to really finish smth in a month even x-x"
Ritalin Changed my life,36 mg once a day extended release
Ritalin Changed my life,Hey just wondering how do you deal with the dry mouth it gives you I have been taking it for about 3 months but can’t get past this
Ritalin Changed my life,"I think he's being unreasonable. Amphetamines and methylphenidate are metabolized in different ways, so some people may in fact respond better to methylphenidate-based stimulants -- and many people DO respond better to them, not because they need something ""less strong"" but because their bodies respond better to it. You could also try going on a non-stimulant ADHD med such as atomoxetine. 

Genetic testing for ADHD medications is still in the early stages of development, but the premise of it is based on evidence that certain genes can affect how different types of medication act upon your body, as well as how your body responds to different types of medication.

I've also heard that not all SSRI + stimulant combinations are ideal for some people. Some are extremely beneficial, some less so, some are actually detrimental. But I can't say much about that because I haven't sat down to do more research on it."
Ritalin Changed my life,"Whaaaaat? Your doctor sucks. I started with Concerta and it is hella way stronger than Adderall for me. The lowest dose of Concerta is too strong for me. I then worked up to 20mg Adderall XR and have to cut back down to 15, since 20mg is too much with too many side affects. But still not nearly as strong as 18 mg of Concerta, which is the lowest possible dose. I haven't tried ritalin specifically, but Concerta is still the same substance. Your doctor is not very bright though, because literally everyone's chemistry interacts differently to different forms of stimulants. There is literally no way for him to predict what each one will do for you until you try it. You seriously need a different doctor. 

Personally SSRIs do nothing for me. They typically increase my depression. But stimulants take my depression away. 

The other thing is, methylphenidate totally affects different things in my brain than adderall does. I get a completely different kind of effect. The only thing they have in common is they both keep me from getting excessive fatigue. And methylphenidate works better for that too. Methylphenidate gives me euphoria, takes my social anxiety away, reduces inhibition, actually helps me be super present with people and catch facial features and see social cues. It slows down my brain so that I feel like I can finally synch up with the world around me and notice every detail as it happens. Adderall does not do that, it just makes me more alert and less tired, and it does take away my depression, and makes me a lityle more focused, especially if I have caffeine too. But methylphenidate gives me strong adrenaline dumps at the slightest of stress so I really can not tolerate it because of that, even though I really felt like the effects made me better at my job, better at home, etc. The side effects are the only thing that made me switch to Adderall. Anyway, totally different effects. Apples to oranges, which are both fruits, both give you energy and vitamins, but totally different flavors. basically your doctor doesn't know the difference between an apple and an orange, which makes him a moron."
Ritalin Changed my life,"A week but it was INSTANT. Like first day. I knew ""Yup this is it."""
Ritalin Changed my life,"90% of the time women aren't believed to have adhd because of the way we exhibit it compared to men .. I am in the process of getting correct treatment for mine due to a misdiagnosis from 7 years ago for bipolar , it's exhausting. I see the same office as my male cousin who went and was diagnosed adhd & prescribed adderall that day but I'm being referred because they ""aren't qualified to diagnose adhd""  🥲🤣"
Ritalin Changed my life,"Seems many Dr's would rather diagnose any other disorder than the one that results in prescribing stimulants.  Prejudiced by moral panic & erroneous information. It's shoddy medicine, otherwise called malpractice. 
I agree with you, self diagnosis in the case of adhd is not difficult, we know our own  struggles with executive function all too well, & with access to the wealth of information now available, online screeners etc, it's  poor medicine to ignore the patients research and call in the prozac. 
These medical ""Professionals"" harm more than heal."
Ritalin Changed my life,"Its kinda hazy, I was like 8 and I don't remember all the details.   


As far as this last doctor he told me ""We could give you an eval but it will probably come back inconclusive. Lets try you on meds. And if they don't work we'll circle back to bipolar"""
Ritalin Changed my life,"I crashed bad the first two days and the high was super noticeable but then I made sure to eat before I took it and it got better.  


I still can't look at food while its in my system w/o getting sick, but at my weight that's a good thing"
Ritalin Changed my life,"Yep that is totally common. I take extended release stimulants and don't find the crash too bad. I think they are less intense in a extended release. But some days I feel it more than others. I basically just have a coffee when I get it and it goes away for me. I never tried the normal release stimulants. And some people do get a bad crash. I actually never got a crash at all on concerta, but on adderall XR I need a coffee at 3 or 4pm."
Ritalin Changed my life,"Its only been a week and the first few days it hit hard and I felt it. Now a week in? It doesn't make me high, but I still can focus.   


Mental health medication is like that episode where Bender was god in Futurama. At the end where the real god says ""If you do a good job no one will even know you did a thing"" That's kinda what it feels like to.   


Though the side effects still hit me hard. Nausea. Insomnia, and I learned today not to take it while riding in a car (I was passenger) because I for the first time in my life got motion sick. It got so bad my poor mom had to stop and get me pepto bismol.   


So no tolerance yet, though I am on a high starting dose. I'll report back if I start to feel like tolerance has taken effect."

Ritalin Changed my life,"I take the same dose of Concerta (another long-acting formulation of methylphenidate) and I can also attest to the positive impact it has had on what I used to call my ""anxiety"", which for the most part wasn't pure anxiety or even comorbid anxiety but in fact a rational response to my generalized difficulties with executive functions."

Ritalin Changed my life,"I just take a sip of water very often. It sucks that my dry mouth is on the inside of my mouth and not at my lips. If it were on my lips, I would have just used a lip balm."
Ritalin Changed my life,"Hope it lasts and stays like this <3 And eat protein and avoid   
acidic stuff when you take it ;) Ah, and drink a lot and all that jazz :)"
Ritalin Changed my life,Well what do you think now of it :)
Ritalin Changed my life,"Sorry to hear :( I'm a girl and got diagnosed immediately with 10. But I didn't get  
treatment yet (almost 28) because the side effects of Medikinet were too much x-x  


So yeah, one can get diagnosed early, but still not get help. And every doctor I went   
to afterwards just thought I just have social anxiety (which I thought as well) or am  
depressed.  


In any case, so happy if you get the right treatment in the future and me hopefully, too <3 But it's insane how often people think we got bipolar disorder :/ Some things are not  
even shared by both disorders.  


Also, the last part with them suddenly not being qualified is, well, really weird :/   
Hope you find someone who ""is"" qualified and will actually take it all seriously ;)  


Sorry it went like this so far :("
Ritalin Changed my life,"I don't know about that figure, but you are certainly correct in terms of women presenting ADHD differently so medical practitioners miss it way more than for males. It's also an issue with minorities and older generations. Even for me as an older male being misdiagnosed for bipolar, it was an uphill battle to get evaluated for ADHD. 

What also plays into this, is if you have made it being an adult and have been able to survive and support yourself, but are really struggling and suffering inside, you have learned masking and compensating techniques that hide the disorder. This is what allows you survive and not be a complete social outcast. I don't consider myself an expert by any means, but I have so far not seen any ADHD evaluation questions yet that account for this. If you don't consciously know how you mask or compensate, you will throw the results off for your evaluation. So yet again the medical system has failed all of us with this. 

I'll leave a link here from a previous comment of mine that has links for how women present ADHD differently and masking. 

https://old.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/ur44si/diagnosis_not_statistically_significant/i8v8c3v/

Also I just found this excellent study that I highly encourage women to read. They even account for hormonal cycles in women and express that there needs to be more research in this area.

**A Review of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in Women and Girls: Uncovering This Hidden Diagnosis**
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4195638/

Oddly enough, as a male I exhibit typical ADHD traits for both genders. That being said, it would not surprise me if ASD plays into this, rather than just having ADHD alone."
Ritalin Changed my life,"I absolutely agree with you. There are certainly a few amazing professionals in the medical industry, but they are often not taking new patients for that very reason as people know they have a competent, educated, humble, and good person taking care of them. The rest leave much to be desired. Even in dealing with my physical health over the years it's been a struggle of doctors that will not delve into problems beyond basic tests, and if nothing shows wrong they shrug their shoulders rather than look into it more or refer you to a specialist."
Ritalin Changed my life,"I know a lot of people don't get proper evaluations (shelling out the cash), just going off what their therapists bring up possible diagnosis and people typically run with it if their issues are being managed and/or treated. I understand that.

I don't think even an evaluation is an end all be all but it helps me feel a bit at ease and is closer to what experience."
Ritalin Changed my life,"I'm starting my journey now, I think I definitely do have severe ADHD. It's not managed well at all. I went backwards and did the eval  with the psychiatrist while trying Adderall to my first medicine specific to tackling the worse of the adhd symptoms. My current psychiatrist believes high functioning autism is at play... Which explains why I always felt off in my way of thinking and processing the world.

I have been trying therapy with different psychologist... but it hasn't clicked yet. It helps a bit  like a bandaid but I was doing it without being diagnosed and my last therapist didn't want to even give me her opinion of what I may have... after even after a few months. 

I understand there's a process but it wasn't helping me. Regular talk therapy feels like maintenance and week to week issues, which is amazing when you feel like you've upacked your mind and worked through the past issues which is what I wanted and now I can with a new lens. 

I want a focused approach and I want something deeper. Currently looking for a CBT therapist with significant adhd experience. I truly feel I have some kinda past trauma that needs to be tackled but it wouldn't ever improve if I could never understand how my mind actually *works*."
Ritalin Changed my life,"Thanks. Good to know. I may ask the doc to try some different meds. I also have heart conditions and was getting scared when my left arm was hurting, when I had the crash."
Ritalin Changed my life,"Thank you very much! Maybe that nausea maybe caused by the insomnia, i don't know, try not to be super excited about it and try to get proper sleep allways. Nevertheless those side effects tend to reduce through time."
Ritalin Changed my life,"Thanks for the explanation and good to know. Sucks, since I know a lot of people  
take prozac and imagine they didn't know about this and that it's not indicative of  
having BP x-x  


So thanks for the info. And oof, sorry you had to go through that and glad you   
don't have to anymore. Manias are awful (and one destroyed my grandpa's life) :(  


And no idea why doctors wouldn't know about these side effects. My brother got   
a med once that can give people severe stomach issues, which is what he had and  
the doctor just told him, ""That can not be. I never had a patient who experienced  
any of that"" ô.o So yeah D:"
Ritalin Changed my life,"Some psychiatrists consider it revealing a preexisting bipolarity.  Sertraline made me flat out fuckin delierious: erotomania and limerence that are still lingering after a year, sleeping 4 hours, losing orientation to time deteriorated executive functions dissociation.  What a nightmare.  Life events played in as well (foreclosure, dead parents, sick dog, etc) but gott damn."
Ritalin Changed my life,"Exactly that happened to me and I was told by doctors that antidepressants don’t do that to you unless you already had bipolar, thus diagnosed"
Ritalin Changed my life,"Oh yeah that still happens to me. But I find it a lot easier to let the content just wash over me and figure out what's going on from context when I return from drifting off. 

And it still has to be compelling, which for me means narrative - I've tried a few nonfiction audiobooks and find them impossible."
Ritalin Changed my life,its ritalin. Doctor gave me ER
Ritalin Changed my life,"Hence the title ""General"" Practitioner lol. 
Before medical research portals opened to all via the Internet it was just stumbling in the dark, hoping to bump into a perceptive & as you say humble practitioner. 
."
Ritalin Changed my life,Yeah unfortunately stimulants are still stimulants. You have to really be careful about heart conditions because they definitely are not easy on the heart.
Ritalin Changed my life,"Ehhmm… I researched it a wee bit and it looks like it actually could be true. It‘s clearly no frequent side effect. 

 No, fortunately I haven‘t been through this. I‘ve worked in mental health and seen things, though. What a doctor should never say is „That can not be.“ bc ppl tell stuff they actually experience. And it could be the first time they see a rare case."
Ritalin Changed my life,"I had literally every symptom you just listed (plus some more) happen to me because of an SNRI (and external factors too). Never heard the term limerence until now but after looking it up it fits. It’s fucking hell, know that you’re not alone. Maybe it’s an ADHD thing to react that way?"
Ritalin Changed my life,"Personally, if a doctor/practitioner dismisses what I tell them, especially on the first or second meeting where they've only  had a total of 30 minutes with me, that's a big red flag. 

I recognize that a doctor knows a lot more about medicine than me, however what they don't know more about, is me. If they're unwilling to listen and at the very least hear me out, especially if it's been a persistent problem where numerous interventions have failed, my response becomes, BYE FELICIA!"

Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,That sounds crazy makes no sense at all as it’s a lifelong thing generally. I’ve never had that issue only issue I’ve had was shortages which happens often. Best of luck hope you get it straightened out
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"Call your insurance company. I had something similar from other providers. It was not an insurance requirement. A pharmacist may inform you that there is a prior authorization and then that's between you and your provider. I had to call my insurance to clear up the gaslighting. No prior auth or any 'tests' or documentation were needed for first line stims.

Some providers and their staff 'guessed' that x was needed to 'prove' to insurance. That was not accurate at all and held up care.

Some of the newer meds needed either step therapy and prior auth or weren't covered.

Talk directly to your insurance company.

(USA)"
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"They don’t need a progress report. That is literally just the Pharmacist not wanting to fill the medication. 
I’m glad you went somewhere else. 
That’s absolutely absurd. The only thing they need is a valid script and if there were any questions as to whether or not it was valid, they should’ve called the doctor’s office. 

I’ve had issues with CVS not wanting to fill a different kind of controlled substance medication before. I took my scripts elsewhere."
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,Walgreens has been pretty wacky for me in FL since this past summer with blue cross insurance. I've stopped using them.
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,This is a specifically Walgreens issue. Their pharmacists are “empowered” to make decisions on filling prescriptions based on their own personal beliefs and will hassle people they don’t agree with. I’d go elsewhere. Fuck Walgreens in particular.
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"Try a mom and pop pharmacy, I had difficulties getting Vyvanse from CVS Walgreens etc and my doc said to try a mom and pop. Got it no problem"
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"What state are you in? That seems really odd, I haven't heard of that before. I get my script from Walgreens as well but haven't picked up yet this month but I've never been asked for anything like that"
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"No it’s not a hipaa violation… it would be a hipaa violation if someone who worked at the pharmacy told your employer about what meds you take… communication between drs office, insurance and pharmacy is protected personal health information under HIPAA"
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,In my experience some pharmacies just say whatever they want to turn you away. I had a Walgreens tell me they “don’t take new adderall patients” and another two just say they were sold out for months so I go to the Walgreens that will take me all the way across town every month. They have literally never been out of stock…
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,Why does anyone even use Walgreens anymore? They always give people issues.
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"For the last year or so Walgreens has made it so hard for me to get my vyvanse. It definitely feels like they're trying to make it difficult with new bs “policies” that keep changing, 2+ week stock wait times, and were always super rude and snappy about my ADHD meds specifically. 

I had a Walgreens pharma tech insist that it's against our state law for them to fill my prescription more than 2 days before I run out. It is 5 days, has always been 5 days, and continues to be 5 days at the CVS across the street lol 🤷‍♀️

OP maybe there are other pharmacies you can try like your local grocery store chains (Kroger, Walmart, target, etc.)?"
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,Hopefully the doctor and the pharmacist speak a common language. I'd ask the pharmacist to please tell me exactly what to send in a message to my doctor so that my doctor would understand and know how to appropriately address the issue. And then I'd ask for their name so I could include it in my message should the Dr. have any additional questions or require clarification.
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,Walgreens refused to fill my prescription for Adderall. The pharmacist said based on my prescription history she wouldn’t fill it. I don’t think I’ve ever been so embarrassed. I cried in the car and I’ve never used Walgreens again. She made me feel like an addict and that is so far from the truth.
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,Have you tried... stopping having ADHD? You should just do that! /s
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,Asking for documentation from your doctor isn't a HIPAA violation. It's probably something your new insurance requires for authorization rather than something Walgreens is doing. It's perfectly legal for insurance to request doctor's notes before paying for treatment. They're checking to make sure that it's been prescribed for a covered diagnosis. 
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"To me this sounds like the results of the telephone game. Many states require that you check in with your prescriber every few months or so with an actual appointment. They call them medication assessments at the place I go to. They, and the insurance, want to see if I'm still reacting to the medication well and gauge my overall mental health. If an appointment isn't on the books, or the insurance is slow about seeing that an appointment was made, they won't fill the medication. That might be the case here?"
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,My insurance requires a prior authorization once a year to continue my script
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,I've been filling my Concerta (so extended-release Ritalin) scripts at Walgreens for like 15 years (midwest USA) and I've never heard of this. I wonder if I'm going to have a nasty surprise when I pick up on Wednesday...
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,More then likely what they need is a prior authorization or just updated paperwork from you’re provider since it’s a controlled substance.
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"This doesn't have anything to do with HIPAA, FYI. HIPAA is a privacy rule."
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,Try another pharmacy? Like Walmart ?
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"The fact you said you had new insurance was my first clue that this is an insurance problem not a Pharmacy problem.

You probably need a prior authorization for the drug to get your new insurance to cover it. Now I am not sure why the Pharmacist was being weird and vague about it, but they could be new. 🤷‍♂️

Call your insurance to ask why they won't fill your prescription, and if they can't or won't say themselves, then ask if you need a Prior Authorization to get it covered.

Then, after calling insurance to confirm, ask your doctor to give a Prior Authorization for it. Some doctors will charge for this, which is why I said to verify with insurance first before calling the doctor and asking them to do it if it wasn't needed.

The only other thing it could be is that Walgreens is not covered by your insurance. 🤷‍♂️"
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"This isn’t a HIPPA issue because your pharmacist has to be authorized to see your medical information to fill your prescription, but it sounds like nonsense. If they can’t give you a form or a clear cut explanation of what they’re asking for, I’d try a different pharmacy. I’ve had way better luck with Costco than with CVS, I’d try them or a Target or literally anything but Walgreens."
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"Assuming the physician is affiliated with a healthcare network, ask to have it filled directly through a local hospital’s outpatient pharmacy if you haven’t. 

I’ve literally never heard of asking for a progress report in my life though, that’s fuckin bizarre - I don’t think they’d ask a transplant recipient for a progress report so they could continue their immunosuppressants…."
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"Call Walgreens’ Corporate number. They’re usually pretty helpful, and at the least they’ll be able to explain any new Walgreens policies, or tell you if what the Pharmacist is saying is bullshit.

Also, call the state pharmacy regulatory agency. They can be very helpful as well.  "
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"Walgreens has been politicizing their services for a while.

Send it to CVS. Preferably CVS Caremark which can ship it to you."
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,Walgreens and Rite Aid seem to be slowly going out of business on the West Coast. I had this issue with Rite Aid a few years ago and now there are none in my city. I would suggest switching to a new pharmacy
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,I switched to a local pharmacy away from the big box pharmacies for this exact reason. How frustrating no one takes your insurance.  Have you checked into mail-in pharmacies for that prescription?
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"They are not actually asking about your progress. Doctors must make what are called “progress notes” after every appointment you have with them, for any ailment. It is not personal. The pharmacy need to verify that you have seen a doctor. It is common. 

Just call your doctor and ask them to send them to the pharmacy."
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"HIPAA is all about the privacy and transfer of medical information between anyone who would be involved in either the treatment, payment, or operation of your medical care. HIPAA already allows for transfer of your information to the pharmacy. Otherwise you wouldn't be able to fill a prescription at any pharmacy at all. As for which information of yours they're allowed to obtain, thats up to them to determine whats medically necessary and for you to grant the authorization."
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"Go to another pharmacy, for some reason the pharmacist does not want to fill. I had an issue where I was filling one day early consistently , because I'm always afraid I'll run into the thing I have in the past where it's out of stock for weeks and I rely on any extra. My old pharmacy would tell me I cannot fill till the 31st day each refill. So I switched to Costco and don't have an issue anymore."
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,Power tripping pharmacist. Call your insurance file a complaint. Call the department of managed care for your state. File a complaint.
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,I’ve been on multiple prescription drugs for about 10 years now. I used to go to CVS and Walgreens and had nothing but problem after problem. For the past 2 years I’ve been using my local grocery store pharmacy (Hy-Vee) and have NEVER had a single problem.
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"What the actual fuck thats like asking a diabetic a progress report of insulin, we need the shit to function for the most part. Honestly i find what they are doing is damn stupid"
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"For controlled substances like Vyvanse, for example, my physician requires a check-in every three months, including a physical exam, to continue prescribing the medication—even though I’ve been their patient for about 10 years. Because of this, I suspect the issue might be less about Walgreens itself and more about pressure from the DEA or another auditing agency requiring these updates from your doctor as part of compliance."
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,Using places like Walgreens and CVS is the problem. I know it's sometimes difficult to find adhd meds but those 2 are ALWAYS my last resort. I'll drive 50 miles before I use them
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,">Went to Walgreens today to pick up my script, Pharmacist tells me they require a ""progress report"" from my medical provider which doesn't even make sense.  

Am I taking crazy pills? That's a pharmacist with big fish/small pond mentality trying to play psychiatrist. You need to file a complaint with the branch manager and escalate this shit to corporate and find a new pharmacy to fill your Rx. Holy shit."
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"Ritalin is hard to get. Even jornay (evening before dosing) is a battle because the ins companies and pharma producers have created a false scarcity and its forcing many more people to aderall. 

Peraonally i hate aderall. It make me jittery when i come off and doeant even work as good as Ritalin. 

Find another pharmacy and have your do send it there."
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,Go elsewhere. Is there a local group that you can ask for info on best pharms to get stim scripts filled in your area?
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,CVS and Walgreens are both really terrible about this. Your insurance should cover more than one pharmacy.
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"Walgreens is trash and CVS really much better in my experiences with both. Even my doctor is fed up with Walgreens making everyone jump through hoops, and even not complying with DEA regulations. Are there any other pharmacies?

 I use a pharmacy at a grocery store chain (not huge like Walmart, local to my region). Never had an issue."
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,It’s a prior auth. A lot of insurance companies require have the Dr office send over ICD 10 code and last office notes. The pharmacy can load that into COVER MY MEDS and get it started.
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"in my 11 years of taking cns stimulants for my adhd, i have never ONCE heard of a ""progress report"" needing to be written to dispense of any stimulants, nor has my psychiatrist ever once mentioned this as a requirement to refill a prescription. this is exactly why i go to a locally owned pharmacy, as i have never ran into any issues getting it dispensed/receiving of my adhd meds (despite the severe raw materials shortage with my lisdexamphetamine dimesylate, or generic vyvanse). but now that i think about it, since ritalin is a schedule II controlled substance (meaning it has a very high likelihood of being abused, and misused that it can be dangerous), they might have a policy in place to ensure that it is being continually being correctly prescribed, as to avoid it being potentially misused or abused, yet at the same time i am still baffled by this, and i am so sorry to hear about this because it is infuriating to not be able to receive any of my medications due to something like this. i do not mean any disrespect or hate from saying that theory, that is just what my mind comes to think. i really do hope you receive or have received your ritalin!"
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,I wonder if it’s because you aren’t a state resident. When I was a transplant in Florida similar things would happen to me
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,Go to a small independently owned pharmacy.  That's what I do.  I never have any problems.
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"It’s likely the insurance company.  I had a similar issue with a prescription non narcotic, but still controlled.  The insurance wouldn’t release the meds until my Dr submitted lab work numbers."
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"I've never gone to a Walgreens pharmacy (closest one is half an hour away whereas the Rite Aid I use is a couple blocks from me). All I know is I'm sick of their ads. It's almost as bad as pharmaceutical ads because they run every commercial break. I can recite the scripts from memory at this point. 

One is specifically about having meds delivered to this woman who has to wear a boot because she injured her ankle during Samba Night. So that's apparently malarkey. They make it seem like they're super personable and helpful, and know all their customers by name.

I guess I mostly wanted to rant about their ads. 😅"
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"I go to a ""mom and pop"" pharmacy. They know me by name, and I even get my pet prescriptions there."
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,Either switch to a different Walgreens or another pharmacy altogether. I've had issues at certain pharmacies myself and even switching to a different location was a better experience

Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"Send it to costco, they are absolutely amazing. You don't need a membership to access the pharmacy."
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"What?!? 

Oh no I’m so sorry!!  This is really really scaring me.   I’m worried there will be more and more of paperwork we will need to do to get our meds.  Which for someone with ADHD, more paperwork and hoops to jump through is a death sentence.  I can’t even remember to make dr appointments or remember to take my medication.  I struggle with all of it.  

 I’m so sick of pharmacists doing that to us.  About 6 years ago I had one pharmacist tell me my drs were wrong and he didn’t want to fill a new blood pressure med for me because I am on adderall. I said “if you look the same dr gave me both, it’s ok she knows. Good looking out though!” Then he was like “yeah I don’t want to fill the adderall for you anymore then.  You can’t take both they cancel each other out.” Of course that’s not true.  What this idiot meant was that adderall might be raising my bp — which might be why I needed the bp med.  truth is I was severely depressed and stressed out and my husband moved out. Money was tight to say the least,  I was taking care of my chronically ill sister, I mean life was very hard so to threaten me with not filling my adderall  just made me bawl.  In the Safeway, bawling.  I couldn’t take it.  I finally got him to give it all to me.  But I am so confused what the f any of what me and my dr decide best for me is any of his business.  If there is going to be a problem interaction that will kill me?  yeah I want a heads up but they should just keep the bs fake doctoring to themselves.  Shut up and fill the scrip!  Please.  (Btw I was on bp meds for 2 months until the stress came down and I lost some weight. So maybe my dr knew something he didn’t?)"
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"I gave up using my insurance for my Adderall. They only allowed a 30 day supply. I started just getting my Dr to send in a 90 day script and using good rx. My insurance also has its own discount app as well that I use to compare. I can see where it's cheaper, call the pharmacy and verify supply, then message my doctor. I'm so relieved I don't have to do that every month anymore."
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"I'm in California as well, and I have to see my doctor every 3 months to continue receiving my Adderall script. Been doing this for 8 years, so your predicament seems reasonable to me. Seems like you only get your meds prescribed by your primary doc, which is also the case for me. I've never seen a psychiatrist, so I guess it's possible that impacts the situation/ requirements."
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"Walgreens is a sinking ship. Abandon it asap, and find a better pharmacy. Preferably a smaller local one. Other large corporate ones like CVS are no better."
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,Walgreens a nightmare. It costs triple what CVS charges for my meds and they were never in stock anyway.
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"Careful with CVS, too… the pharmacists can elect not to fill for any reason. Many CVS pharmacists (only in my experience) have been super biased against ADHD meds and would try to talk me out of picking them up. Making sure you want to be on meds is a valuable conversation to have… but with your doctor"
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"I would rather have hot coals dropped down my pants than to ever step foot in a Walgreens ever again. Such a shit pharmacy with hostile employees. 

I now use a small pharmacy that is affiliated with my psychiatrist. Since they know the doctor personally, I never have a problem. Plus it’s great that I can grab my prescription and be out of there in 2 minutes. The pharmacist is so caring, and actually calls me if a problem arises, so it can be fixed BEFORE I get to the pharmacy.

Boycott Walgreens!!!"
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"Sounds like total bs but the reason it doesn't violate HIPAA is that both your medical provider and pharmacy staff are covered entities (that is, they are both included in the group of people who specifically *do* have access to your healthcare data for the purpose of providing you with healthcare)"
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"Pharmacists can refuse to fill prescriptions for various reasons (drug seeking behavior, general impairment in decision-making etc.). Whatever the case may be, you can switch pharmacies and try to get it filled. Usually works."

Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,It’s a Walgreens thing. They fax(lol) a form to your dr. Takes 5 min to fill out. Call your doctor.
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"Don’t fill at Walgreens, CVS or any big chains. It is consistently an issue with them in my experience. If you don’t have a local business option, try a grocery store pharmacy."
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"Walgreens was ALWAYS out of my adderall, so found a local pharmacy and they always have my meds. Searched on Reddit to see which pharmacies in my area always had it in stock, n that's how I found the one I go to now lol. But you can call around to diff pharmacies and their diff locations n ask if they have it in stock, I've had to do that in the past before my current pharmacy.  Also, don't forget about the pharmacies in grocery stores like  Kroger, walmart, meijer, Costco, etc. Meijer always had my stuff too but then I switched from concerta to adderall n they were almost always out of stock of that. That's when I started going to Walgreens but then they started running out too. But yea I'd say local or grocery store pharmacies are your best bet, chains like Walgreens n CVS are too popular, but low key aren't as good (in my experience)."

Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"are you sure they didn’t say it needs a prior authorization? sometimes it may be called pre approval. i work as a pharmacy tech at walgreens and most of the time, it genuinely is the insurance that’s stopping us from
filling it. whether that be not covering your rx or needing a PA first, there are very few reasons that the pharmacist is actually the one who is refusing your script. 

it’s frustrating for us as medical professionals because then patients think that we are refusing to fill their scripts. i do understand (as a stimulant patient myself) that it’s just as frustrating for the patients, especially because they cant understand what exactly we’re telling them a lot of the time. i.e. i can say “your script needs a prior authorization” but they still won’t know what that means. 

i recommend to start by contact your insurance. this is most likely where the hold up is stemming from. best of luck to you!"

I will never use them for ADHD meds again after they filled my daughter's generic Adderall script as brand and then fought with me about it. Like do you not realize that I can see what the doctor sent on MyChart? It was generic, it did not say Adderall. I ended up just using one of those pharmacy cards and paid five times what I should have if it was the generic because she was young and needed her meds. Now she's a teen and knows how to white knuckle it for a few days if necessary, but back then she wasn't going to school without her meds so I just paid up. 

You sure there aren't any other mom and pop pharmacies that can order it for you? Used to have my kids Evekeo ordered at the mom and pop one down the street from me. Now my insurance has about five of those type of pharmacies around me, but we use Meijer because they take Adhenzys and they are a partner pharmacy. Not that it's not without drama because sometimes they have to fight with the system to get the card to go through to drop it down to $50, but it's better than hoping and praying we can get generic Adderall."

Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"Go to a different pharmacy. I was having trouble consistently filling my prescription at one certain pharmacy (a Safeway pharmacy). I kept being told there was a shortage, this reason or that that it’s not in stock. I ended up moving so that definitely helped. Oddly I’m using a Safeway in a small as fuck town and have never once had an issue and it’s usually filled day of. When I was having to use that other pharmacy I was told by my doctor to call around and ask other pharmacy’s if they could fill it. And one did. It was a pharmacy at a hospital oddly. But yeah just call all around. It might be some weird cvs company policy to verify that clients are actually being seen by the doctor. Just try calling around and change your pharm"
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,">Pharmacist tells me they require a ""progress report"" from my medical provider 

Your insurance likely needs what's called a prior authorization from the doctor .. which is kind of like a progress report, but it would just state how long you've been on it and who's been prescribing it for how long... because they are new to *you* and do not know (officially on paper) that you have been on this for a year... .. It's stupid counterintuitive insurance bullshit where they have established this right where they get to micromanage what your doctor says you need (a small percentage of the time, the insurance company ends up having the better interest of the patient in mind because a doctor may be overprescribing due to financial kickbacks from the pharmaceutical company .. but in general, it's to use any excuse not to cover the cost)  

The pharmacist/pharmacy has no jurisdiction there... They cannot approve or deny anything ... They are the middle man... 

I am guaranteeing you that they incorrectly communicated what is needed, or you misunderstood them, or both... But it'll be ok 🫂
.. double check by speaking with a different pharmacist at whatever Walgreens is convenient for you, and call your Doctor about it. Your doctor should have a staff member that handles prior authorizations and pharmacy communications. If all of that fails, call your insurance company and find out what other pharmacies are covered.. there may be other independent pharmacies that do accept your insurance and you just don't know they exist yet. 

I'm in NJ and have been prescribed ADHD medication since 2016. The struggle is REAL AS FUCK with national adhd medication shortages, and this whole insurance company-pharmacy monopoly bullshit. 

You must advocate for yourself. The information you were given is inaccurate. Do not just give up and pay out of pocket at CVS. It doesn't matter what state you're in, no pharmacy will ask you to justify your need for a medication, it is not how it works, it's the insurance company, and it's an easy fix. ... The insurance company may end up denying the claim, but you can appeal the denial... If that fails, then go to CVS out of pocket. 

Stay strong and keep me posted if you can. You got this. 💪"
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,Just use CVS. Walgreens is notoriously bad for this.
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"I would definitely be contacting someone higher than the store level for clarification.  If the prescription is current then Walgreens should have no say in the matter.  If it's the insurance requesting it, they should be able to contact the Dr office for clarification rather than going through Walgreens."
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"You'd be surprised. Here in Germany, people who are disabled because they lose body parts have to get documentation from a doctor that they are still disabled every few years.

It is annoying, but necessary because of how the laws are written, because you can't just get granted benefits without a time limit. 

The good news in that is, it is a minor inconvenience in most cases and never results in the benefits being withdrawn or cut because you are suddenly less disabled. Ain't bureaucracy fun ?"
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"Just chiming in here so OP hopefully sees it:

I had the Walgreens tell me the same thing. It’s dumb and nonsensical, but not actually hard to resolve at all. I told my doctor they requested it, he wrote something up, we were back in business. Didn’t take more than a day or two. 

Doesn’t take much effort, and tbh Walgreens has been great for me despite the shortages going on. Every once in a while they will say they’re out, but just call back every day to ask if your prescription is ready and I’ve never had to wait more than a week."
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"This is exactly right. When I called my insurance directly, turned out it wasn't even their requirement - the pharmacy was just making stuff up. Insurance cleared it right up. Definitely call them first before jumping through random hoops the pharmacy tells you about."

Annoying, but in the end my insurance company called the pharmacy and got it going."

Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"if a pharmacist refuses to dispense the medication EVEN with proof of a prescription, due to their negative beliefs of these drugs, then they should not have been in pharmacy to start with. someone needs to start cracking down on pharmacists, pharm techs, and pharmacies in general that are doing this, as from my understanding it is interfering with a HIPPA violation AND somebody's health."
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"Walgreens point blank told me they did not want to fill it (I was a CVS customer initially, but they were out due to the shortage, and recommended Walgreens) because I was not a “loyal customer” and that “hard to find medicines” were reserved for those who got ALL of their medicines at Walgreens in the first place. They then said they’d consider filling my controlled substance only if I switched ALL medications over to them. I can’t make this up lol. I was floored.

I immediately called Walgreens Corporate and reported them- I thought it was definitely illegal for them to not fill a prescription I needed (and it made me so mad that they would “consider it” if I gave them routine business). It felt like someone was dangling my prescription over me while I struggled.  

Turns out, according to Walgreens Corporate, the head pharmacist can absolutely deny filling a prescription if they have their reasoning behind it. I was shocked by this because how can you be a pharmacist and deny someone their medication???

I ended up finding a CVS 50 minutes away that had the prescription I needed and they filled it, no problems or questions asked. I will never set foot in a Walgreens again."
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"CVS was worthless for getting my vyvanse, I also went elsewhere, sounds like Walgreens may need to be avoided as well, I don't understand why there ms so many stories about pharmacists refusing to fill meds. Not to downplay their job or education but its like they get all self righteous and think they can decide whether we need stimulants or not when if they went to med school and not just pharmaceutical school they would actually understand ADHD and stimulants and not just think we're drug addicts who can't sit still like everyone else"

Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"Not Walgreens but I got fucked over bad at a Walmart pharmacy because of a policy like this. 

I was uninsured and the only affordable way to get my Ritalin was a higher number of lower dose pills. (The lower dose scrip was significantly cheaper and I was in college, so every penny counted.)

All was fine until one random pharmacist “didn’t like” how many pills I was getting, and even after I explained they refused to fill it."
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"Yeah, Walgreens is a special brand of stupid. Even though it's the easiest one to get to for me, I still go out of my way to go to a different pharmacy because of their policies."
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"That’s actually the law. Pharmacists and doctors have a “corresponding responsibility” to make sure a treatment is necessary and appropriate. So they are held just as liable as your doctor for what happens to you and the DEA comes after pharmacies before they go after providers.

So all pharmacists are empowered by law to use their “clinical judgment” on whether to fill scripts. It’s just some pharmacists have clinical judgments that are very biased and paranoid."
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"100% back you on this, but i believe the fda, or government needs to be investigating and cracking down on this sort of issue, I believe Walgreens is an actual fraud of a pharmacy business, because the doctor is the legal individual to that person's health and to prescribing, not the pharmacists. Let the dang doctor do what they are LEGALLY able and obligated to do, and just fill the stupid med. it's not that hard of a concept for them to know."
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,I kinda love that the intense bureaucracy and bullshit being pushed by these giant corporations is actually driving more business to small companies.
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"I managed (with some effort) to get mine from Costco of all places.

Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,Not that I agree with what they’re doing… just saying it’s not illegal.  Insurance companies like to make money.

Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"SIde note - you are correct but HIPAA is **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act**.

Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,Actually part of hipaa was to protect against exploitation and discrimination. This was prominent with the pharmaceutical industry and insurances.
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"Neither of those are them saying whatever they wanted to. With the shortages being the way they are a lot of places aren't taking new stimulant patients because they want to be able to fill for their own patients first and if there are people coming from other pharmacies then their original patients risk not getting what they need. It has nothing to do with them deciding they don't want to.

And again, because of the back orders and people switching back and forth between different kinds of meds a lot of places have been and were sold out for months. It's different for every franchise and it's also different for every store. The DEA bases the amount of stimulants that a pharmacy gets on their last years total dispensing (not exactly that but I am on break and work and have a very short time to write this) And the increase of patience does not mean an increase of allotment of stimulants."
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"Idk if you're saying they were sold out of Adderall, but it has been hard to get sometimes due to shortages over the past couple years. My pharmacy (Rite Aid) has run out before. They've even shifted supply around with the other 2 Rite Aids here and given people half their script when necessary til they have more. Luckily I haven't had any problems with supply issues for quite awhile."
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,Those things are not lies. Some pharmacies cannot take more maintenance controlled scripts due control/non-control ordering ratios imposed by distributors and the DEA. Also shortages are absolutely real.

Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"I also just wanna say, I feel you on this frustration as I’m sure many people here do.

Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"I don't think so, not if you haven't had an issue with them before.

Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,Every 3 months. But Walgreens cant see that type of medical info. It's up to the physician to complete the process/office visit and then write the script. They can't access medical notes nor do they need to. They have to contact his office to check with the physician/med staff.

Except his last one, it put his IQ one point over the competent to stand trial threshold level - because apparently he was required to undergo thousands of dollars of testing every 3 years to make sure he was still GENETICALLY intellectually disabled!?

Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"I agree that it’s deplorable that people with these beliefs go into pharmacy work. However, pharmacists have the right to not feel a script if they are uncomfortable with such, or have suspicions. 

And no, it is not a HIPAA (not spelled HIPPA) violation. There is no information being illegally transmitted, that otherwise should have been confidential. 

It honestly sounds like the pharmacist isn’t comfortable filling the script & doesn’t want to have that conversation."
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"Hey what happened definitely isn't right but hopefully this can provide some more context. The ratio of non-controlled drugs to controlled drugs that a pharmacy dispenses is monitored. If the ratio is too high in favor for controls this gets flagged and can trigger an investigation by the state board of pharmacy and/or the DEA, which is exactly like the bureaucratic mess it sounds like. Retail pharmacies are already overworked and likely they were in a situation where they knew they were closer to the wrong side of the ratio than not, and didn't want to deal with the potential headache of a DEA investigation."

Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"I had the same issue with Rite Aid. They treated me like I was a methhead  or like a drunk person at the bar that they needed to cut off when I tried to fill my Adderall prescription.  

It should be considered discrimination for pharmacists to do this. It's not their call whether or not we need the meds, it's our doctor's. The doctor said I need Adderall, the pharmacists should not be able to insert their own opinion about whether or not that's correct.  They're supposed to be making sure the prescription they're filling for ME AND MY DOCTOR is correct per the order, the proper dosing per the order, and doesn't interact with anything else I'm taking.  That's it.

Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription.

Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,What's sad is the small pharmacies make less money for the same med because the big pharmacies control their own pharmacy benefit manager (which is a separate business from the pharmacy) so they arbitrarily set higher drug prices charged to insurance.
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"Costco was a bust for me too, so frustrating"
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"Some pharmacists may be making their own personal biased decisions on if they will fill scripts- not based on the doctors order but on the pharmacists belief system.

For instance some employers allow pharmacists to decide if they will dispense meds like birth control or morning after based on their belief about abortion etc. They let them refuse despite the doctors order. This isn't where pharmacists do medication reconciliation as part of safety practices."
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"Walgreens is the absolute worst pharmacy to get stimulants from - I prescribe them, so I should know.. They will literally lie to the patients, once telling one of mine that my DEA number expired and then when I called them on it, they said ""oh, sorry we made a mistake.. Well we don't have it in stock and don't know if we'll ever get it."""
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"Hmm. Yeah that's odd. Maybe it's because it's your first time filling a prescription with them they are just asking for more information? It could just be a formality but if I were you I'd just play dumb (not defensive) and ask them what the doc is, what its for, how they will use it and where that information will go. If your doc is fine sending it over I'd just send it"

Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,Trust me every time I called these Walgreens that were trying to shoo me away the pharmacy techs would say different things. On the same day some of them would say it’s out of stock and some would just say they can’t fill it because they aren’t taking new patients . It was all very inconsistent and sus and just an annoying part of having adhd and needed a controlled prescription filled :/
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,Yeah I know that’s a huge issue. The pharmacy I go to luckily has never had this problem. But I no longer live near there and the pharmacies near my house have said other things besides being out of stock like they aren’t accepting new adderall patients or that my prescriber is in Walnut Creek and I live in sf so they can’t fill my prescription (which is complete bullshit those places are like 40 min away and people make that commute to work every day)
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,I realize that’s a huge issue. But It’s the different pharm techs saying different things at the same pharmacy in the same day that feels very sus to me..

Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,It's similar in the US.  Disabilities have to be documented over and over or you risk losing benefits
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription.

Was tied up in just a couple days and haven’t had to do it since."
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"tbh unless your insurance company *is* the issue, most issues can be solved by calling your insurance company.

Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"i heavily stand with you on this point, as it is not the pharmacy's job to be ""prescribing"" or thinking they can be doing this due to their knowledge or whatever they believe of these medications, it is their job to educate patient when needed, dispense and refill the medication accurately, and be done with it."
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,I think a lot of pharmacists don’t like stims and just want to place as many obstacles as they can to keep people from getting them.
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"trust me, the messages we sometimes get from insurances when they reject scripts are jokes in themselves. its like they genuinely think they save money by giving us as little information as possible to work with while writing it in as few letters as they can"
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,Except it's not a HIPAA violation for pharmacists to require medical info from you. They're just as entitled to your medical info as your doctor.
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"Yeah, I don’t inherently have issues with pharmacists being able to refuse prescriptions - to do otherwise would probably cause a whole range of other problems.

What I really don’t like, is a pharmacist who fabricates excuses and lies to patients about _why_ they’re refusing to fill the prescription. I would imagine they just don’t want to argue about it, which I’m sympathetic to, but your patients deserve honesty."
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,It is when they require you to bring in your medical records as proof of how you are doing on the medication.
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"I even used the CVS that my mother in law managed and sister in law worked at a pharmacy tech, I waited like 2 weeks with it just saying ""out of stock ordering"" before I was like I'm not waiting for that and I'm not dealing with this every month when I get a new script from the doctor and switched to a large but local grocery store pharmacy and they had no issues filling it"

Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,Walmart around me are so good. Everything with Walgreens was a headache. Now it’s usually super quick except for a few times a year you gotta wait a week because its out of stock but its in stock here wayyy more often then other pharmacies around here!
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,The only time I could see that being necessary for adhd stims is if they take a really unique regime. I had one patient who had 3 different methylphenidate doses. An ER and 2 different mg IR. The 3rd one was like a lower dose for evening time. I could see someone like that requiring documentation that there's good reason to being taking that amount (and that late into the day) maybe like a person adhd is severe where they might get into car crashes if unmedicated idk or maybe they have narcolepsy etc etc. But just a typical standard prescription needing documentation seems excessive. Unless the doctor is already on the dea's radar but the pharmacist wouldn't necessarily know that. Or maybe the pharmacist is already in hot water and they need to extra careful 😬
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,American medical and pharmaceutical systems are wild!
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"it actually has a good reason - pharmacists have in face saved countless lives. Either because perscription is for toxic or overdose ammount (or if the perscription looks strange i.e. changed from 10 pills to 100 pils)

in other cases - pharmacist sees the medication doctor has prescribed, what other doctors have perscribed and what off the shelf stuff you have bought. When prescribing medicine or dosage doctor might not know of other medication or supplements you are taking. some combos are extremely likely to kill you , and pharmacists are not just cashiers, they must have degree in pharmacology (in most cases I know of) , and as such they might even know more than doc's about some medication.   
Oh, and  if you are buying retinol without ""pill"" contraception.  

all of these are extremely important cases when pharmacist has to work as ""last safetyguard"" to save your life (not yours per se , but they do save lives. And one day it might be yours)"
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"we really need to be punishing pharmacists, or doctors should be giving out pills directly."
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"You do, but it keeps docs from diagnosing via the throwing-spaghetti-at-the-wall method and ordering tests and treatments outside their specialty.

Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"Ha sorry. I work in governance risk and compliance. HIPAA, PCI, ISO....all those are my thang."
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"I have ADHD, I am on a stimulant, AND I work in a pharmacy. It sucks. But they're not doing this to anybody on purpose. It isn't even our fault on this level. A lot of pharmacy techs don't ask before they Tell people if they do or don't have a controlled substance. Which, considering what it is, a lot of pharmacies won't tell someone if they have anything in stock because it makes it easier for them to get robbed. Pharmacy techs aren't supposed to be telling anyone if we have control substances. Some do unfortunately and some don't unfortunately. 

That doesn't change the fact that pharmacies only get a certain amount and if someone else knew coming to that store needs a stimulant they're not going to help that person over a fully established regular patient that might not get their medication. There is a big problem with shortages and back orders of all stimulants, because when people can't get one strength or one brand they try to get another strength or another brand which throws it into continual back order or ordering problems or not being in stock and able to get.

Not saying it's right but there have to be better ways for the DEA to handle this and people really need to understand that it's not the pharmacy's fault. Do people honestly think we just hoard medication that we can't take ourselves because we want to? Oh yeah let me go grab that non-existent stock out of the back room that doesn't exist. Everybody is having an issue And I wish it would get better. Plus can you imagine being a child that can't get their medication? I've had to tell parents we don't have it. I would give up my medication for a child even though the last time I did I almost had my house go up for auction (Non-Payment of house taxes), didn't file my taxes until last week, And almost got fired three times within a month.

Everybody thinks they know what's going on and they think they know who the problem is but really they don't. They need to have a better system. And unfortunately until that system does get better this is going to be a problem."
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"I’m also on a stimulant and work at a pharmacy. These things are not lies. That pharmacy already has a high volume of control scripts. That’s why they are out. They are also trying to stay out of trouble with the DEA by maintaining their ordering ratios. BUT if they are out it’s easier to say they are out, because then they know you aren’t going to scream at them."

Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"Unfortunately in the US their function is to clear people off the roles.

Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,Sounds more like the insurance company needed an updated ‘prior authorization’ in order to cover your med—perhaps because you are getting name brand instead of generic?
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"Omg, I have to call my insurance company if I want to go get a loaf of bread at the market. It’s just issue after issue after issue, then they expect us to somehow solve it by placing a million phone calls. This real issue is that these “issues” don’t even fucking exist. Why do I need to “get my insurance company on my side” when they’re my insurance company? I pay them to be on my side."
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"I think the last thing these people need is for us to keep making excuses for them and trying to explain away their actions.

Surprisingly when I started picking up a second dosage of the same medication a month or two later nobody thought anything of it. I think it's just luck of the draw.
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"That's not the same as refusing to fill prescriptions based on ones political or religious beliefs. 

They do play a vital role in legitimate medical medication reconciliation. 

This was not an example of that role."

I work in medicine too but not pharmacy but I know to some extent what it’s like being in a service oriented industry that’s also affecting people’s health and how angry people get and when they take it out on you when it’s not your fault. Anyway didn’t mean to be triggering just giving my two cents! The Walgreens on 300 Montgomery st in San Francisco on the other hand is my favorite I have known all the staff for 6+ years and they never let me down, so even though it’s across the city I still feel super lucky compared to other experiences I’ve read about on this sub 🤣"

Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"Controvercial take: Yeah, I kinda don't feel as bad for a kid having to wait for their ADHD meds versus an adult. Kids don't have bills to pay and lives to maintain. They may struggle, but it's not life or death.

If their parent needed them and didn't have them, the whole family would end up homeless. The stakes are higher.

But most of all, no one should have to do without. That is what I really think should be the standard. I don't want anyone to have to struggle."

I’m 95% sure that it’s just some bullshit Walgreens does to cut down the number of pills they need to distribute, probably because of the prescription farms that have sprung up across the country giving out bogus adhd diagnoses."

Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"as a stimulant taker and a pharmacy technician, i wish more patients understood that we are not choosing not to give you your medicine. if your insurance doesn’t cover it (whether that be in general or for the time being) then your only options are 1. pay out of pocket or 2. wait for insurance. i promise (at least at my store) we are genuinely trying our best to get everyone their meds. 

even if the person doesn’t actually care abt the patient, at the very least, we just want to get you out of our line. 

just wanted to put that out there. pharmacies receive A LOT of backlash for things we can’t control. we can’t just hand out drugs without jumping through our designated hoops first."
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,Thank you! I literally had the same convo with a pharmacist *yesterday*.
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"I hate pharmacists like that. If they filled it, then why they gotta have some attitude now? people are just judgement. Thankfully the pharmacists i work with don't judge people on stimulants like that. They only keep an eye out for red flags and then investigate the concerns. Like they do their due diligence but don't treat the patient any different. 

Now the pharmacy that I pick up my stims at the staff isn't rude but they are so quiet and emotionless (this pharmacy is inside a clinic so I think they are told to be chill) but sometimes the reserved nature comes off as like from judgement if that makes sense? Where I work it's at a retail pharmacy and so I've always got my retail smile going 😁 and will have friendly conversation with patients while I ring them up etc etc. Also my pharmacist manager is also really thorough when she consults patients. When I pick up new meds the pharmacists there give me nothing even when I ask questions!"

Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"I see where you're coming from, but imagine these children trying to get through school and have a better life in the long run not be able to get meds. Their quality of life later in life will absolutely be worse. Just like those adults who started stimulants later in life because their life up until then was terrible and there was something wrong and they weren't medicated for it.... That is what those children are going to turn into. I know, I was an unmedicated child with a parent who refused to acknowledge that I might need something. And I screwed up a lot of my life because not only was I not Old enough to take myself to the doctor I also wasn't old enough to understand why my parent was always angry with me And always calling me the worst names and grounding me for something that I was trying so hard to do but couldn't get there. I feel like a lot of adults that got diagnosed later in life should understand this.

So yeah I understand where you're coming from but you also have to realize that yes it could be life or death for a child as much as it could be for an adult. It could literally ruin the rest of their lives. 

To the point where I didn't plan to be alive after 18 because I thought I had screwed my life up that bad by messing up in school and not being able to make it through the first couple of months of college. Thankfully I got pregnant with my son and made it past 18 and had a very supportive mother-in-law that I owe my life to who still is there for me when I need her.

Edit: to add this: ultimately we do agree though. Nobody should have to go without and it's ridiculous that they can't figure out a better way for this to work"

Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"Why should any of these companies (pharmaceutical, insurers, etc) be an issue when they’re supposed to help?

Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"JupiterSaturn’s point is absolutely fair - if you had to call your insurance company to buy bread, would you suggest the insurance company was the issue?

You shouldn’t have to call your insurance company in the first place."
Walgreens refused to fill my ritalin prescription. What can I do now?,"In all fairness I threw up a huge number of red flags when I was going to pick those up. I'd recently swapped doctors as well as increased dosage and pills per day multiple times over the last few months. They got multiple scripts on the same day for controlled substances, one of which they could not legally fill for two more weeks at minimum. I also showed up looking visibly disheveled and not matching the photograph on my driver's license very well.

On the flip side, we have to remember what red flags actually are...causes for concern but not necessarily problems in and of themselves. Every single red flag had a good explanation, I didn't have to give it but I certainly could have. In my opinion the pharmacist was not doing due diligence, although I'm personally largely against the regulation of medication in general.

In this case I had recently swapped doctors because mine had moved to another state to retire. I had also swapped from extended release to an equivalent dose of immediate release because of an issue with how I metabolize it. The new doctor sent two prescriptions (refill plus new lower dose) because I changed halfway through the month, the old doctor only had me on the higher dose. My picture didn't match because I had shaved my head a day or two earlier."

""Why shouldn't i be able to feel well/functional when I'm at home too?!""

I usually expand upon this with 

- it really isn't cool for my husband to live with a zombie on the weekends (which is what happens if i don't take my meds )

- if i take my meds, chores and admin stuff (like taxes for example) i need to do at home get done. If i don't, my house and personal life are a mess and i lose money to fix what i couldn't do off my meds. Just because it's at home doesn't mean I'm only relaxing and having fun there, there's also non-fun stuff that needs doing. 

- This includes shopping for groceries - taking meds keeps me physically & financially healthy by not going for takeout all the times because i feel overwhelmed by the idea of going to a crowded supermarket when off my meds. 

- To do fun stuff, you generally have to organise the fun stuff, bookings, calling friends etc. That's much much easier to do & follow up when on my meds compared to off. And doing fun stuff keeps depression away."

Both my teen daughter and I have adhd. Separate psychiatrists. Both of them have independently said that from their perspective one of the nice things about treating (yes treating!) adhd patients is that you can prescribe medication and the success rate is 70%. The highest within the work that they do. 
And that a daily medication can give people their lives back. 

There is a huge toll to unmediated adhd. Anxiety depression suicidal thoughts. Working doesn’t come into, it is about how the adhd makes you feel. I felt like a failure. I always have. Working or not had sod all to do with that. It was every part of my life that was affected. Family, relationships, friendships, hobbies (lack thereof). Everything really. 

With medication I feel good. I can think clearly. I’m so much more present. I’m how I should be but never could be before. But deep down inside it stops that horrible gnawing feeling of impending doom and anxiety which leads to feelings of failure and depression. 

I still find it incredible how elvanse can change so much for me.

","I tried telling my psych many times that Adderall wears off for me after about 3 hours and 2 doses were only enough to get me through until early-mid afternoon. Which doesn't work for me since I have 2 small children & need to be able to function for stuff like making them dinner and putting them to bed. I was a SAHM and took Adderall every day (none of that BS taking the weekend off meds - I need to exist on those days too!)

She would counter with ""you can't expect to be medicated 24 hours a day"" which is not what I was asking for. I just needed to not crash & burn at 3pm when I have a family to care for. One extra dose would have gotten me through the rest of the day but she wasn't hearing it.

I don't know if it was a clinic policy thing, a personal/specific to her policy, or what. I tried Adderall XR but that only lasted about 3.5 hours and made me rage like crazy. She wasn't willing to consider other meds either.

I stopped taking the Adderall all together because to me, it feels less shitty being unmedicated vs being chronically undermedicated. I also quit that psychiatrist and haven't had the executive function to find a new one.

Life sucks and I hate it, but here I am.

My recommendation is to find a new provider and get a second opinion. If they're not hearing you when you tell them you need to be able to function every day, then they are probably not a good fit. (Also...do as I say, not as I do lol)"

Additionally, one of the most extensive studies on ADHD and driving was a 2014 studyTrusted Source based in Sweden. The study tracked the driving records of more than 17,408 people who have ADHD between 2006 and 2009.

Go to an actual MD.

 Other healthcare providers such as psychologists, RNs. PA, and Nurse Practitioners have significantly less education even though they like to claim they are just as qualified.  If they can prescribe, they are limited to fewer choices for exactly this reason.

The denial of Riralin for the reason given shows the ignorance of non MDs.

The non MDs can be useful parts of a medical team but this is a case where the job description needs to be reigned in.

Many people say they prefer the non-MDs because they take more time with the patient
  This is very true.  They earn lower wagesas per lower training so can do this.

I wish MDs could take more time.  They are overworked to begin with.

I’ve utilised as many free local resources and group therapies as I can. Alongside regular therapy and finding like minded people on an app called [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/apps/). There’s groups for people who have adhd etc and it’s amazing to know you aren’t alone ❤️"

I know how hard it is to change providers, especially when you're struggling, but you deserve to have the issue you're concerned about acknowledged and a treatment plan that works for you. Ideally you & your provider come up with a treatment plan together, though that's often not the case and they just say what they suggest (albeit like it's the only option and with authority). But it's your body and health and you ultimately decide what you do and don't do with that. Unfortunately, it seems to be a combination of doctors telling patients what to do, leaning heavily on their experience and authority and us not knowing or being taught that we're allowed to/have to advocate for ourselves. Many of us learn the hard way that we have the autonomy and we're allowed to use it. Good luck!

ETA: psychiatrists can be hard to find, get appointments with, take insurance, etc and often aren't as concerned with your whole medical picture. I personally have had great luck with Psychiatric Nurse Practitioners (NPP) to alleviate these concerns. Your PCP/GP can assist you when medication type and dosage are confirmed but I find NPPs/psychiatrists more helpful with this initial work that can be nerve-wracking and difficult."

(Don’t, that would be condescending.). I don’t understand why people of science can be so obtuse.  As a neurodevelopmental disorder, ADHD impairs Executive Functions ranging from emotion inhibition to time management which are used outside professional environments. And those are just two out of various EFs.  

In fact, it is a diagnosis criteria of ADHD that the patient is impaired in various areas of life, not just one: Work/school, relationships, family, at home, social settings…

I’m inclined to believe your psychiatrist is not up-to-date on ADHD but that would be a bit judgmental without having proper cause. I would try to understand why he/she believes having an occupation is the only place that would make medication preferable for you. Maybe there is more to this reasoning.

Maybe you’re able to play in a band because you can remember to practice… or whatever. What is the impact of being on the med?

I tried to explain to her. I even said my provider would talk to her because there is no interaction between the 2 drugs, especially with the dose I'm on, 1mg.

I think OP described it beautifully.  If they've already said these things to the psychiatrist, then there probably aren't magic words that can be summoned.  If not, try saying what you said here to them, OP.  If they still don't listen, definitely time to ask another doctor.

I hear the frustration for you in other commenter's voices, and this is an issue that is legitimately frustrating.  Sadly, I think if you splash frustration AT your psychiatrist, no matter how how out of line their POV on ADD is, you'll be even less likely to get results (people get defensive when they feel attacked, even if your frustration is SO justified and tend to double-down).  So if reasonably explaining what you said here doesn't work, I'm afraid it's new doctor time.  Perhaps you may still need to go to this psychiatrist for other reasons?  That's okay.

They wouldn't tell OP they don't need medication for depression, or schizophrenia, or bipolar just because they weren't working (at least I hope not), but far too many psychiatrists and doctors are way too focused on the school/work portion of ADD.  They seem to have little idea how challenging it makes our social and home lives, or how hard it is for many of us to get up and go to the grocery store and make a meal (especially in a timely manner).  And yet...becoming socially isolated, or feeling ashamed because we can't interact with our loved ones the way we need to, no matter how much they care: that can cause depression and social anxiety.  Not being able to do the things we love: shame and anhedonia.

One of the reasons people with ADD have co-morbidities like anxiety and depression is because of all these strains in other areas of our lives.  NOT giving OP their medication can have serious consequences for their overall mental health and well-being.

So frustrated for you, OP.  I hope all of these comments are at least helping you know you're not alone and you have every right to feel all the feelings about this."

I don't like that this is how doctors think about ADD meds or that this is the pressure they're under, but it is unfortunately true that they do and that this IS the pressure they're under.

I don't think you were saying this is right, just that this is, unfortunately, probably why OP is facing this pushback.  I face it, too, every 3 months (it used to be every 6, next thing I know it will be every month, and my doctor's slots are extremely competitive--she needs them for other people who need care).

Non-medical mental health professionals can also help clients learn to advocate for themselves with prescribers. And, if you’re in therapy with them, knowing how medications or lack of medications are impacting your daily life and functioning is part of their job. 

Knowledge of the classes and subtypes of psychiatric medications, their purpose, their interactions, and their potential side effects is a significant enough portion of the licensing tests for non-medical MH practitioners that not knowing a decent amount about psychopharmacology would make it very tough to get licensed.

They also usually have a lot more face-to-face time with and knowledge of their client’s daily life and struggles than a psychiatrist, who may only meet with someone for 15-30 min med management appointments every few months after the initial intake. A non-prescribing practitioner who meets with the client for 50-60 minutes every week for many months or years is probably going to have a lot of good insight into whether or not someone could benefit from medication or benefit from advocating for a change to their existing medications that aren’t working optimally or are causing difficult side effects. Either recommendation is well within their scope of practice and doesn’t involve them suggesting a specific medication or dosage or telling the client how it should be administered, etc."

Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"MEXICO: speaking from personal experience, I go from the USA to Mexico at least twice a year, and never, ever have they even shown any interest in the contents of my pillbox. I have never bothered to take a prescription bottle oo copy of it with me. It just doesn't come up.

I suppose it could come up someday but in the last 20 years of traveling wih my prescription it hasn't happened."
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"Missing Australia...

Absolutely do not bring any meds, you will get ""The Boot""

When you get here just look for a bloke named 'Robbo' he has a mate can hook you up...

Sorry, this is false, sometime he is called 'Stevo', 'Jonno', or 'Mick'.

And remember... Everything is really trying to kill you here...


Edit for real cobber: Best to declare with a letter from doctor.

Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"I appreciate the effort. But there is a risk here. Depending on the medication you are bringing in Schedule 1, or Class A listed substances. Not something to go about lightly on quite a few countries on this list. No offense OP, but I wouldn't ""trust"" this information with a ten-foot pole. Not because it is inherently wrong. But because the ramifications may be huge. A mistake here can lead to a boatload of trouble. **Please, please add a disclaimer that everyone has to do their own research and go through proper authorities. Starting with your prescribing physician.**

&#x200B;

I looked into this a while ago for a travel to Iceland, the USA and Canada. And what I learned there is not fully covered with what I'm seeing here.

\- **Schengen declaration is valid for** **up to 4 countries** within Schengen and needs to be approved by the issuing body in your country. This can sometimes be the embassy.

\- **A medical declaration for countries outside of Schengen needs to be legalized for use in country of destination**. Here this has to be done by either the District Court (for countries taking part Apostille stamp) or through the Embassy of the country you are visiting. A medical declaration is only valid for the specific country you are travelling to. You cannot use the same declaration for multiple countries."
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"I don’t see Singapore on here.

Japan...I have read that Adderall is not allowed AT ALL, only ritalin, and that you better make sure you follow all the steps so your visit to Japan doesn't turn into a nightmare.

Perhaps this has changed? Just throwing out as an FYI"
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,Sources would be nice
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,Man this is crazy. I wouldn't even think to look this up before I traveled and I'd just put an Rx with a toothbrush and comb. Thanks for doing this (but I'll probably still forget).

Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"Currently living in Japan! Just gotta correct ya slightly! Adderall is outright, totally banned. However, Concerta is allowed to be brought in with a Yakkan Shoumei, while Vyvanse is allowed with approval of the Narcotics Control Department. I was allowed a long-term stay supply of 60 days worth of medication. In terms of availability, you can get Concerta from psychiatrists here, but not Vyvanse."
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,Thank you so so much!!! I’m travelling in a couple weeks for the first time since I started medication; I wouldn’t even have thought of asking for any papers from my doctor if I hadn’t seen this!
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"Didn't see it on the list, so adding on:

**Korea**

Amphetamines - banned. Can't be prescribed domestically. You can try for an exemption through the email below, bit if they say no, don't try it. They are strict on narcotics imports.

Methylphenidate - allowed. You need to email [narcotics@korea.kr](http://narcotics@korea.kr) for an application that you submit with a doctor's note, prescription, and travel itinerary 90-days before you travel. Up to a 3-month supply allowed.

If you need more than 3-months, getting a prescription here is relatively painless. Some doctors will write you a domestic prescription right away without a full ADHD screening if you bring a prescription from your home country. Even if you have to get screened again it's not very expensive."

Off the top of my head I don't believe the 7 day limit applies in HK.

Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"When I was getting my PhD in oceanography I had to go on 2 research cruises that sailed from Panama. I just decided to elide the issue and stash a month's worth of meds and loose-leaf tea (which i was also leery of traveling with because it's loose dried leaves) on the ship while it was in the US and we were loading our science equipment and heavy luggage on it. The stuff technically went through customs, but when there's that much stuff on a ship, they don't have time to go through every bag. Also, I mostly wasn't using any of it while I was in any country (we were very much in international waters for the entire cruise)."

Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"Does anyone have info for transmitting flights. Ie where you have connecting flights, and a layover but not clearing customs.

There’s not much info out there but it’s stressful to not know. If you aren’t clearing customs in Singapore, you don’t need to declare even if you have it in carryon.

Not sure about other countries though."

Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"This is super helpful! I've been wanting to travel to Japan and Korea whenever I get the money (and it's safe to do so) but since being prescribed with Ritalin I've been a bit worried and found a lot of the information hard to understand. So this is super helpful!

Also Australia wasn't noted but here's some information! [https://www.odc.gov.au/travellers](https://www.odc.gov.au/travellers)

* Proof of prescription or a letter from your doctor listing the medication(s) you're carrying have been prescribed to you. Also needs to include the name of the medication and dosage. 
* The medication needs to remain in its original packaging with the dispensing label intact. 
* Can only bring 3 months worth, if you need more you'll need to consult with an Australian registered doctor for additional medication once you've arrived in Australia. 
* **Declare all medication to Australian Border Force upon arrival**."

Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"oh its come down for japan then, you used to be able to take 7g of ritalin without a yakkan shoumai when i last got one (for my co-codamol) all amphetamines (elvanse/vyvanse included) are absolutely banned in japan, no ifs whys or buts so if youre planning a trip to the land of the rising sun make sure you get an alternative med or can handle the time without the meds

Let's give people 30 days of their medication, so we can laugh at them suffering from withdrawal for the rest of the month.

I would recommend keeping the meds at home for shorter trips. Its not worth it. 

Always look at forums of those individual countries to learn about the experience and get documentation/approval well in advance from the destination countries’ applicable department to save yourselves from harassment.

Question: how do they even find out you have the meds? Like I've always traveled with my other meds just fine, nobody even mentioned it. Nobody asked me what pills I have, and I often don't even keep them in their packaging but put all the pills in a container box with these slots for am/pm Mon-Sun. So I wouldn't even have anything to show them to tell what pills I have.

I do make sure the labels are clear with my name on it (standard good practice for any prescribed meds), but that’s the most thought I’ve ever given it! Also, I backpacked for a year - started out with 3 months worth then went to local doctors in Israel, France, Spain and a few others and got a refill easily each time since I had proof with me.

- go to your doctor
- ask a statement that includes (I) name, (ii) dosage and when do you need to take them, (iii) how many pills your are bringing in the country.
- send it to the Uzbekistan embassy in your country for translation and proof.
- get back a certificate copy"
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"Thank you so much for this! I am going to Canada to study for a semester (I study in the Netherlands). My doctor gave me enough Vyvanse for 4 months, but your overview shows only 30 days’ worth is permitted. Do you have any idea how I can get more in Canada? I’ve already paid for my 4 month supply in The Netherlands. My doctor doesn’t really seem to know much about medication and traveling, so would love to hear if anyone has advice!"
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,I've been trying to find such information for travelling with Methylphenidate to South Africa but can't find any solid info. Where should I look?
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"This is awesome, thanks so much.  I travel for work and have self medicated on coffee for 3 days before just to cope in certain places.

What's the source for the Netherlands one and do you know what ""proof of prescription"" actually means? Like in a prescription bottle?

Also can confirm for USA, when you declare at customs they really do not care at all."
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,You fucking legend. Was trying to find info on Poland but couldn't find anything. Even my Polish girlfriend couldn't find anything on the polish site.
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,God Bless you for this! Saving this.
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"Thanks a lot for this, it didn’t even cross my mind that meds might be a problem while traveling (because I don’t travel, so it’s not a problem)!

Also gotta love long-ass French acronyms. Everyone else has normal names for their health national organisms and with us you gotta check in with the AFFFDLLAASP918€&3@@. We really are the ""not like other girls"" of countries"
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"Thank you so much !

I don't know if I missed it or if it isn't included but for South Korea you must fill a form for the customs ten days before traveling etc, you can only bring up to three months of prescription and you need your prescription letter I think"

Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,I'm wondering what counts as proof of prescription. Is it just the label you get on the bottle or would it be a separate note from the doctor🤔

Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"Only if they can source every single claim. It's no sweat off OPs back if someone gets caught smuggling ""drugs"" into one of these countries by missing a step. Preferably a link to each companies governmental websites with the info."
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"Completely disagree. 

If your traveling internationally with controlled drugs you should absolutely not be using anything posted on Reddit to guide you. 

If this was changed to a list of countries and urls I’d be 100% on board, but if the text on documentation/declare/amount is included in the stickied post as it is here, promoting this as a reference is inappropriate. 

Even if OP is 100% correct today, they might be wrong tomorrow. 

A source for links per country? Awesome resource. 

Static information posted to Reddit without regular updates? Dangerous. 

OP fanatic work aggregating this, really cool read even if I’m not traveling soon. Totally no disrespect, just concern."
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"Agreed mods please pin this, this is invaluable information"
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"In the UK methylphenidate is prescribed but controlled, and classed as a ""schedule 2"" substance.

If you're carrying less than 3 months' supply, you need to carry a note from your prescriber. It's unclear if it needs to be declared at customs, but since this hasn't been specified, I guess not?

If you're carrying more than 3 months' supply you need the above PLUS a permit. It's basically like a Visa for your meds and you need to apply for it in advance.

There's not much detail here but there's a few links if you need more: https://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs"
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"I was wondering the same. I am not taking any of these medications currently, but I was curious in case I ever am, and the UK is the most likely foreign country for me to visit anytime soon (I'm in the US)."
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"i’ve brought my adderall scrip over many times! i was told i was allowed anywhere from a 1 to a 90 day supply and needed a doctors note accompanying it. i did not need to declare it. 

while crossing the border, no one has ever addressed it, let alone asked to see my documentation. but definitely bring some! i just had my GP draw up a quick blurb on clinic letterhead that says something to the tune of, *hey you alright, pscle takes 25XR once per day for her brain wiggles, no dramas x*"
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"Thank you. In terms of declaring at customs, if it's stipulated DO it. Otherwise, you could get done for suspected trafficking etc. Border officials don't excuse forgetfulness or honest mistakes."
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,Adderall is banned outright. Methylphenidate is not.
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"Adderall is illegal almost everywhere I've checked. 

Ritalin is more readily available but not the same obviously."
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"Thanks to Brexit, I’m sure. I have never (as a Finnish citizen) been asked anything regarding my medication when travelling. Doubt you will be either, but as long as you have your paperwork in order, you’re probably fine.

And your prescription might be valid for medication from a Finnish pharmacy, and if you ever feel overwhelmed due to lack of meds, you can visit a local health service, and they can fix you an emergency dose.

So it’s very likely you will not be asked, searched, etc. but if you do, as long as you have something to prove those are your medication and you need them (a prescription), there won’t be an issue."
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,Please do. I'm intrigued to see how you fare (well I'm sure). Enjoy!
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"Yeah, I was just thinking, looks like I will just try to go without meds if I visit certain countries! I would prefer to have them but I can probably go without on a holiday and potentially ending up in an Indonesian prison because I miscounted the correct number of pills to bring doesn't really seem worth it."
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"I know right? Like geez thanks Egypt, I didn’t wanna see your dumb pyramids anyway!"
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"Haha, I know right? Thanks. Many countries will put you in the slammer for nothing."
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,It depends on the destination. Most require permission for extra amounts to be taken.
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,You could look at working with a local doctor depending on length of stay.
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,I recommend just going to a local doctor

Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"Confirming information about Russia.
The information about methylphenidate needing to be declared was checked by calling airport customs. 
To add: to fly in you need a letter from your doc saying your meds are for you personal use. The letter needs to be translated and certified by a notary. You can add the receipt from a pharmacy stating the price of the pills since you would need to put it down, too. And they also checked the quantity of pills on a case. 
I had absolutely no problem after that."
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"Nice one, will be added to list posthaste."
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,Traveling from the US to Mexico in 2023 to get married. You had no issues? I'm prescribed adderall and we will be there for a week so I need to take it with me lol. A day or two i'd be fine but not a week.
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"I was about to add my experience going to Australia just before the pandemic. I did bring a lot of medications with me for my trifecta of ADHD, anxiety, and depression... Came with a letter and everything, was ready to declare it at the Melbourne Airport... The lady from customs just took a good look at me and said, ""Medicines? You're fine."" Turns out personal meds are apparently exempt and I didn't even have to show the letters or got anything checked."
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"All of the information was sourced from the respective Embassies of the Nations mentioned as well as the International Narcotics Control Board. If there's not enough information I haven't included it. Most GPs (here in UK) know precisely 0 about travelling with controlled meds. You have to do the work yourself, unfortunately."

Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,Ummm what? I went to Singapore with my meds twice - no one ever looked at my meds. Is this a new crackdown?
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,Another thing: Adderall is banned here as it is a addictive substance. Only Ritalin/Concerta/etc is allowed.
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,Thank you! You've made my day! :)
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,I have already stated this. Adderall and Dexedrine (any kind of Amphetamine) are BANNED. This post is in regards to Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin (which are legal).

Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,I'd be wary about connecting flights in certain countries. You have to contact the embassies of the respective countries of where you are travelling and see what they say regarding that.
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"I take vyvanse, and have had one korea trip planned, so started the process... I believe vyvanse is banned, but methylphendiate is allowed, however you have to download some forms and apply for a permit, attaching evidence. Then wait.

Japan is much the same, I have heard of people getting vyvanse permission.

I suspect still futile for me, but I must try as I am not someone who copes unmedicated. I sleep really badly and have extreme anxiety and panic, which will come back!"

If I'm honest, Methylphenidate MAY be permitted. Egyptian authorities just provide spectacularly poor and vague information on the subject. From what I've read, they look down on it – ADHD is largely unrecognised in Egypt – despite the medication being available, apparently... Chaos!

Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"It's always a good idea to keep your meds in the original packaging for travel! There are quite a few countries that care about that. You should also travel with something that indicates they're prescribed no matter where you're going (pre-ADHD meds I just used the printout my pharmacy would give me that listed all my prescriptions, but I would probably go for an actual printed prescription now)."

I would also take a letter of proof. I just got one from my GP confirming my name, address, DOB, what medication I'm taking (Concerta 36mg/30 tablets monthly) and why (ADHD).

Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,It really is!
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"For the UK, I would advise you bring:

A) A copy of your prescription/script.

B) A letter of proof (a letter from your doctor/psychiatrist) stating :

* Your name, Age, Personal Address
* Medication (Vyvanse) plus dosage (eg. 36mg) and quantity (eg. 30 monthly)
* Why you need the meds and what you take them for.

I don't think Vyyanse is used much in the UK, but you shouldn't have any problems. Certain quantities (3 months and over) do require a import licence though from the Drugs & Firearms Licensing Unit at the Home Office."

Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"Proof of prescription is the bottle plus the label including your personal details etc, as well as copies of your prescription script.

A proof of licence is usually in the form of a medical certificate from your doctor/psychiatrist, stating why you need to take your meds."
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,Thank you good sir.

Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,Thank you for doing this. I didn't even think about this when I went to Thailand with over a months with of Concerta. Didn't run into problems but it sounds like I just got lucky.
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"This is a great guide! Just an fyi, I’ve traveled all over with my meds, even a year in Australia and Southeast Asia, among many other places-40 plus countries, and have never had issues with my medication. I keep it in the bottle and DO NOT PACK IT IN A CHECKED BAG. I keep it in my backpack and have never declared or mentioned anything about it."
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,What about United Kingdom?
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,I agree. A link to the full official requirements would be excellent.
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"I agree. And then still. The reason that there is no ""definitive list"" is because this information is inherently scattered over governmental website all over the world. Different agencies within countries are burdened with part of the task of monitoring. For example in the USA the DEA is tasked with enforcing the rules on scheduled substances. But the TSA is tasked with checking what you're bringing in. Both may require different information or proof. I would vote against pinning this. This is one honest mistake away from disaster."
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"Edit - My bad didn’t see this was Ritalin specific in the title, info is accurate for Japan. 

adderall is banned in Japan, you can’t bring it in at all even with paperwork. Ritalin is legal however but the post omits that distinction. I had to temporarily change medications when I studied abroad there.

Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,Good idea.
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"OKH, spot on, people need to pay their own due diligence before travelling. Rules and regulations changed constantly. Hopefully, people realize this."

And where else do i get it?

Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"Correct, I suggested adding an addendum explaining that the requirements for/treatment of Adderall may be very different."
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"Very, very important to make this clear at the top. Saw that it was for a few different ones and thought, well this handy... thinking it was for adhd meds in general.

Nope, just one specific one... that's useless for a lot of us.

Those jail happy countries will thank you for declarating it on arrival and still give you six years in a cell."
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,If someone had got our dear departing Prime Minister on Elvanse about 20 years ago we might all have saved a lot of bother and suffering.

Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"Went to Egypt (and a few other countries) four years ago with my meds and had no idea lol. They seemed pretty gung-ho about getting the tourism industry back on its feet after the Arab Spring though, so rules were pretty lax across the board. Fun times, lots to do on the cheap, would totally recommend 🤙"
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,How could a local normal GP help with these prescriptions when in our own countries it’s always a whole song and dance with referrals and specialists and restrictions?

Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"Good idea. It’s a very good and informative list though so well done. I actually hesitated posting this story about Russia because it’s not likely anyone will be visiting any time soon but still.

The medication was called Pantogam Active (пантогам актив) and it really fucked me up. It’s used for a range of neurological/psychological conditions and is bought over the counter. It spiked my anxiety BIG time"
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"I’ve travelled with adderall in dozens of countries. Mexico most commonly, since I live in San Diego. I always bring it in the pill bottle that I get from CVS. Never declare it, never had any problems anywhere."
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,How much of a supply counts as personal medicine?
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"Most likely thing to happen, sure is.

The restricted stuff ('Schedule 8' here), anything that can be addictive or misused for example, adhd meds, codeine, cocaine, heroin, crack... ;) I would definitely get proof just in case.

Few years back an aussie spent a few days in an Indo jail because he did not have proof of prescription for his ADHD meds.

Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,So. Can you provide links to the official regulations?And will you add the disclaimer?
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"Honestly. I dont know. For me it was easy. Iceland is within our ""shared borders"". All I needed was a declaration signed by the appointed authority where I live. Doc signed confirmation of subscription. I used that to get official document. I bring the meds. Took al but one trip to the relevant authority.

As youre a foreigner. Rules will be different. Also check for bringing back meds too.."
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"No it’s been in place for years. I travel there for work and always need a letter. I would NOT advise traveling without it, they can kick you out of the country and ban you from coming back"

Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,Wow seriously? That's the best news I've heard in a long time! I mean it will be a couple of years before I can visit Japan but this makes it much more doable (I thought I'd have to switch my daily Vyvanse to Concerta temporarily).

Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,thanks for your reply! a friend of mine who is from egypt has adhd too and this might be super important info for her to know if she wants to start a medication and still wants to visit her family.
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"Lol I have an Adderall prescription but my kid has Concerta, so I feel this. I think the only reason we handle it as well as we do is because we use it as a ‘work day’ or ‘school day’ only med."
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,Dude I was kidding but you are beyond incredible. I've had to travel to 3 of the countries on your list and it was SO stressful checking the regs especially because in two of the places English wasn't the dominant language. You're doing gods work.

If you don't already have a prescription, I'm afraid you'll need to go through the process of getting diagnosed by a psychiatrist first, for which the waiting list can take years."
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"> Those jail happy countries will thank you for declarating it on arrival and still give you six years in a cell.

Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"Schengen is honestly such a boon for regular citizens it’s worth any kind of money. Brexit remains one of the dumbest political moves of the modern times, benefitting exactly no one.

Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"Yea, just make sure you have your proof of prescription with you, and the meds in their original packaging, labeled. FIMEA says thanks to Brexit, you can only bring a 14 day dose with you. You also cannot bring multiple meds at the same time, if they have been deemed conflicting. Full law is here https://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/2002/20021088

But fear not, if you run out of medication in Finland, you can visit a public clinic for an acute dose, and a possible Finnish prescription."
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"Who could help you then, silly? 

If you already have an existing diagnosis, many countries allow doctors or clinics to give you an acute dose, until they can manage to get you to a referral.

Sure, googling a private doc is an option as well, or if your prescriptions are directly transferable, you could do that."

Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"DianeJudith, where are you going? They will only find out if: A) They perform a search on your belongings. B) You declare your meds on arrival. If you are going to a country where you must declare your meds then they will inspect them and see if you have the necessary and relevant paperwork. As Spaceefficient said, keep all your meds in the original packaging with the all the labels and instructions guides, as well as copies of the scripts (photocopies will suffice, although I'd just bring the real deal). A medical report by your relevant doctor/psychiatrist wouldn't hurt either."

Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,“Nothing in here but clothes” is almost an invitation to rummage!
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,It was a long time ago. I had scripts that I hadn’t filled because I didn’t take my full dose every day and I was able to fill 5-6 scripts at a couple different pharmacies.

Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"What does ""certificate issued by the health authorities of the country of destination"" mean?

Like, the place I'm traveling to has no idea who I am, much less my meds?"
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"Nah, that's not a reasonable burden for anyone but the government itself, and even that's a stretch (you'd realistically need a notice period and old/new rules documented at the same time to actually hit 100%/100%). Rules change rarely, and when they do change, they tend to change in small ways. So even out of date info is likely to provide value, even if it's just to give you a sense of what to look for elsewhere.

I think it would be reasonable to put a big disclaimer at the top, a link to the big disclaimer on each country (in case someone links to a specific country and they don't see the main disclaimer), and then put a revised date, summarized info, and links to sources. It must be left to individuals to verify that the information is still current."

Adderall and Dexedrine are definitely banned regardless. Methylphenidate isn't, but you must adhere to the rules regarding it."
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,I believe it has something to do with the Yakuza and their trafficking of amphetamines but that’s just what I’ve heard. Just bias towards it bc of that.
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"I suppose its because Adderall is an amphetamine based drug, while ritalin is a different class of stimulant thats not in the same family as amphetamines"

Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"TBH before Brexit most EU borders were only a very minor inconvenience from the UK. Helsinki airport was very easy.

Nastier issues are things like pensions, or if we end up wanting to care for ageing parents stuck on the wrong side of a pretty hard border. Even if you got them in, what would their entitlements to healthcare be?

My Dad voted for Brexit and honestly I'm pissed off. Where was the thought about real and serious consequences?"

It's a royal pain in the ass to travel with these meds so this guide is a good idea, it just needs to be backed up with some official links in case things change. Though I guess everyone should always be double checking."
Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,I might have to stop taking it anyway though because I don't know how to get it in Japan and my country has a law where you can only get 30 days worth of pills at a time.

I won't declare them and I don't think I look suspicious or anything lol, so I hope they won't search me. 

And unfortunately I can't get any other paperwork in time. 

My other meds are all antidepressants, so they aren't controlled like that. I only have the pills in the original blisters, I always throw the boxes and leaflets when I get them. I'd ask if that's ok but I have no other choice anyway."

Travel Guide on bringing in Methylphenidate/Concerta/Ritalin to foreign countries,"Coming from the UK, which is a bit of a special case at the moment 😢. 14 days supply max, declare at the border with a copy of the prescription. From most EU countries you can take more but need different paperwork.

I emailed the embassy who advised me to call Tulli (customs) in Finland, who then gave me a contact at Fimea (medicines regulator) to email.

I find that Finland is quite bureaucratic compared to Britain, but that Finnish bureaucrats tend to be competent and helpful. I'd recommend contacting your local embassy for help as I did."

I took my first Ritalin pill today and i couldn't believe that was how people lived all along.,"This is coming from a good and educational place: please know that the first couple days are going to feel better than your average. The initial euphoria you can experience can be very pleasant but misrepresentative of how you’ll feel once your body adjusts to the medication. With that said, most people still notice a huge difference in symptom reduction in symptoms from ADHD, so that’s good. My first three days on Adderall I was able to see how disorganized and messy I had been living and was able to clean and organize everything to a very functional space. I still maintain it to this day and am able to do much more thanks to it."
I took my first Ritalin pill today and i couldn't believe that was how people lived all along.,"I didn't take my meds until I was 29. The biggest revelation I had the first time I took my medication was that I could actually listen to people when they were talking to me.
 

Normally I'd be hearing a part of a song looping in the background of my mind all day, or be thinking about what I should say when the other person is done talking. Sometimes even thinking about something else completely different from the conversation. 

After my first dose the music stopped, and I was able to actually focus on what the person I was engaging with was saying. It was amazing, I had no idea that was a normal thing for others.

Damn near made me cry from joy and loss at the same time."
I took my first Ritalin pill today and i couldn't believe that was how people lived all along.,"I took Ritalin as a kid but don't remember how that affected me other than my parents weren't as frustrated with me as usual, poor people lol.

I quit taking it in high school because reasons and didn't get back into it until my 20's.

Second time around, the humongous difference clicked big time. I had been in a rut, basically just wallowing in a stagnant pool of no progress, no motivation, and no direction in life.

After I became medicated again as an adult, I just felt like doing things again. And it wasn't torture.

But the biggest difference was long-term planning/life management. Setting a long-term goal and working at it a little every day until it is accomplished is an absolutely ESSENTIAL life skill, and without medication I don't have it. With medication, I feel human."
I took my first Ritalin pill today and i couldn't believe that was how people lived all along.,"I was prescribed Dexampetamine 5mg two weeks ago. I took it, immediately noticed that my room was messy, and cleaned it. Just, like, cleaned it. No struggle, no putting it off, no stopping halfway. I finished and just looked at it and wondered ""how was that so EASY???"". I had literally not cleaned it in 5+ months, but that day I did it and it took literally no effort. Since then it's stayed clean, because when I see a dirty dish or something on the floor I pick it up and put it away. Seems ridiculous but I never realised what a struggle life was until I started taking my meds. The mental block in my mind was suddenly lifted."

I used it for a while, changed to concerta then medikinet. But now, It works but It just feels unpleasant. I feel the energy and need to accomplish something, I feel the same clearness when I first started using meds but I still couldn't got up to do the simplest of jobs even with meds. When I used meds It just made it worse because I wanted to do and needed to do lots of things and for a reason I couldn't.

Now I don't use meds and I feel better. I still keep some for emergencies though."
I took my first Ritalin pill today and i couldn't believe that was how people lived all along.,"I was also in my 20s when I finally got diagnosed. People had told me my entire life that I had ADD symptoms. Professors, friends, family. I never believed them because I would get a good book every now and then and lay on my couch for an entire day, or two, or a week, and read through the entire book or series. How can I have ADD when I can clearly hyperfixate on one book to the point that I'd forget to eat for an entire weekend? 

My first prescription was some non-stimulant that had off-label use for ADHD. I basically blacked out for 2 days and don't remember much. Then they put me on concerta which just gave me a headache and made me stare at the wall a lot. Then vyvanse which was incredible and I was finally doing my schoolwork instead of just talking to people when I was supposed to study, but it kept me up all night. I'd have to take melatonin and benadryl just to fall asleep. 

Now I'm settled on an Adderall XR in the morning and an IR around lunch. I graduated top of my class from grad school, I have a great job, two small businesses, overall much better quality of life. 

Little tip: I take a tolerance break for a weekend every few weeks. Seems to make the meds more effective overall."
I took my first Ritalin pill today and i couldn't believe that was how people lived all along.,"Having been on meds for a while, Ive personally concluded that it’s not quite how others feel. 

An absolutely amazing metaphor I saw on here (apologies I cannot remember who wrote it) compared medication to using a step stool. You’re now able to reach the items on the shelf, but you still have to climb up the steps. Taking that metaphor a step further, everyone else is tall enough to reach. 

You’ll find there are days when the meds cause you to focus on the wrong thing. Or where you just can’t focus despite them. Or where you take them and still forget to the thing you were supposed to do. 

So, what I’m saying is, there will be times when your ADHD is still on full display, despite the medication. Just don’t beat yourself up about it and try not to make negative comparisons between yourself and others. 

You have your step stool now - just take it one step at a time."

I was able to read my textbooks once and retain the info instead of reading the same page 5x and understanding nothing, I was able to pay attention for a whole class period without getting agitated, I was able to be more social because my brain finally worked fast enough to converse... it was already the end of that semester so not enough time to see how it effected my grades but the next semester, my final semester in college, I got a 3.9 gpa my highest ever ( I got all A’s but my college does A+=4.33, A=4, A-= 3.667) that semester I was also able to land my dream internship for the summer and then I was offered a full time job halfway through for when I returned from teaching English in Spain.

I took my first Ritalin pill today and i couldn't believe that was how people lived all along.,"Hi 

I am not sure, if you will still read this, but I will just try.

First of all, I am very happy for you and I hope, that you will be able to improve yourself longterm with the help of ritalin.

I just have a couple questions regarding your dosage and the release mechanism of Ritalin, since my first experiences with stimulant medication werent that great.

With how many mgs did you start and did you increase or decrease the dose afterwards. Which one worked best for you.

I got Medikinet, which contains the same drug as Ritalin (Methylphenidate), but has a different realease mechanism. It is delayed and thus last about 8 hours, but the initial push is not as strong ( I would actually prefer it that way, because it enables you to be productive for a longer time and I am not really looking for a high). Do you know how it works with Ritalin. Is it also partially delayed and are there any other differences? I started with 10 mg, which did nothing. I took 20mg yesterday and nothing again. I took 40mg today and I cant really tell, if it is doing a lot a part from the dry mouth and slightly blurry vision. I feel weird, but I am not sure, if I am actually more productive now and to which extend placebo has to do with it. I thought 40mg would be a pretty decent dose and I dont know, if I should keep increasing it. I also took zopiclone to sleep yesterday (1 am), but I dont think it lasts that long (It is currently 13:50 where I live). 

If someone has any tips or answers, I would greatly appreciate it ;)

Best of luck to you all"
I took my first Ritalin pill today and i couldn't believe that was how people lived all along.,"The first time I took Adderall, after being diagnosed, it was like someone turned down the volume in my mind. I describe it as having several internal radios, all set to scan, so the stations are regularly changing at varying intervals. When I took Adderall and my mind went quiet, I looked at the person I was with and said, “is this what ‘normal’ feels like??” It was almost eerie, but it was incredible. I sometimes experience imposter syndrome with the diagnosis, especially because I’ve only recently been diagnosed in adulthood, but moments like that shut down that feeling pretty quickly."

Also it's worth noting that taking a pill doesn't make you not have ADHD while it lasts, it just makes it easier to do things with ADHD. It won't give you an idea of what it's like to not have ADHD.

I took my first Ritalin pill today and i couldn't believe that was how people lived all along.,"Yeah 

First day on Vyanse was an amazing eye opener. 

I was telling my wife I finally understood why she got frustrated when I walked by a messy sink and didn’t clean up. There was so much I just didn’t “see”. And I could finally just do it. 

No worrying about how much time it wasn’t going to take, no putting it off because “I have to leave in one hour, can’t do it *now*”. I cleaned up so much crap in the house. 

I finally understood how *her* mind works. 

And it made it easier to explain how my brain works. And how frustrating it is when you spend So. Much. Energy. to do almost nothing and getting called lazy (or imagine that they call you lazy) 

That first euphoric feeling is gone now but it’s still a lot easier to concentrate, focus, plan, organize, clean up (haven’t left a glass on my desk in a week), etc. 

The meds probably saved my marriage, tbh. And my job."

I wasn’t diagnosed until adulthood as well (when I was 19), and I gave up trying to read at a young age because I thought it was just impossible for me. I also gave up trying to force myself to study, and this carried on until my second year of university. 

I went from not reading a single book until I was 19 to reading dozens of books per year. I’m now a graduate student, and I don’t think I would be where I am now if it wasn’t for the medication—especially when I’m in a field that requires a lot of reading."

I can say from my experience that the super motivation effect does taper off a bit but you are left with a bit more of a composed ability to get out of your own way when doing tasks. Tasks cause me less mental discomfort now and I'm more able to fend off distractions and im no longer mentally exhausted at the end of the day.

I took my first Ritalin pill today and i couldn't believe that was how people lived all along.,"**skip to the second paragraph if youre short in time...**

i started taking pills when i was 6, mother wanted 4, dad said its too early in his opinion. the main reason i took a pill at a so young age was because i was, and still am, extremely hyperactive, talked and moved ceaselsly. my mother wasn't prepared for this kind of a child, i was her first and last child due to that reason. i tried all kinds of pills, ritalin, adderal, concerta, vivance, even stratera which is a long term pill. at last it was 22.5 mg of focalin IR per day, 7.5 mg taken thrice. 7, 11, 14 oclock. since the day i remember myself i was drugged (and thanks god for that) i dont remember how it felt, im used to it and was young thus cant really answer your question precisely.

now im 17.5, due to beaurocratical reasons i switched to focalin XR, let me tell you that dexametylphenidate chloride is the best there is in the market of ADHD pills. you see, ritalin's active ingredient is metylphenidate, the dexametylphenidate chloride is the active part in the metyl. scientists managed to split the metyl to useless stuff and dexametyl thus creating a much more expensive and much better pill. today i take 30 mg of focaclin xr, 10 mg thrice a day. the doctor wouldnt sign for higher dosages, its not good for the heart. 

the pill is what keeps me alive in all terms. i cant live without it . i cant focus, i cant talk to other people cause i cant concentrate in a conversation, i eat plenty of junk without thinking--> im impulsive, once i burned a map in class after buying 100 bucks worth of coal. i talk and move ceaselesly. will you believe that i cant read a book? i dont manage to stay focused for more than 5 secs (i mean concentration span) which requires me to refocus my energies in text thus tiring me after 5 minutes of reading. the pill manages to help me with all these terrible stuff. i cant do math at all, it requires to much attention which cannot be divided. unlike litreture where u grasp the general concept, u cant miss a detail in math or the numbers go wrong.

apparently most people think differently they dont think the side effects worth it. most of them use metyl, i dont experience any side effects with the dexametyl ive never met someone who's as hyperactive as i am, the H in the ADHD is what makes it even more impossibe to concentrate (my own movements distract me). **u asked about metylphenidate, aka ritalin. i think its terrible, ritalin and all its relatives... concerta...** they make me extremly anxiuos, my muscles itch my face hurts and my mouse is dry, no dosage solves the problem for me. when i was young i took 90 mg of concerta for some time. it helped a lot but was not fun at all, the side effects were terrible."

Unfortunately my blood pressure was near the cusp of too high and it jumped to a place where I could feel increased jugular pressure and I didn't feel great. 

I stopped taking them after 5 days and contacted my prescribing psychiatrist. This was a massive shame because I was finally getting a lot of shit done! After just over a week of no meds and not much drive I've just started again with 20mg elvanse and have been exercising the last three weeks to get my weight down.

I took my first Ritalin pill today and i couldn't believe that was how people lived all along.,"I am so happy for you! It is wild and I can totally relate-
I had started taking ritalin a couple years back but never got to a therapeutic dose, so never got any results and just stopped going to my doctor. (Shocking, I know lol)  
Since that time, I started doing a lot of work on building coping, management, and organizational skills. I started a mindfulness and meditation practice- which have benefited me HUGELY. I recently started back to school (for the 4th time) and decided to return to my doctor and commit to it this time. 
The first month, I didn't experience any results. When he adjusted my dose the second month (a few weeks ago), I was at work and suddenly realized I was JUST WORKING. I wasn't constantly watching the clock. I didn't feel like I was about to jump out of my skin from being so restless. I wasn't gnawing on the inside of my cheek, like I have my ENTIRE life. I didn't FEEL anything. I didn't feel extra motivated or driven or like I was ON something. I just noticed what I WASN'T feeling. And I started tearing up. I could not believe it was possible to feel this way. I always wondered HOW people DO it? Why did everyone else just always seem to be fine and not like they were going crazy, too??? THIS is how. They don't experience the CONSTANT, RELENTLESS feeling of overwhelming restlessness. 
It made me a little sad to think of just how much easier my life COULD have been and how different my life would look at this point. The things I could have done.... 
When I took it and sat down to study, it was the same thing. I just noticed that my mind hadn't been wandering while I was reading. I wasn't constantly opening new tabs because, ""Oh yeah- I wanted to look up that thing about that thing I was thinking about the other day,"" which would lead to me opening more tabs to look at more things that popped into my head that were completely unrelated to what I NEEDED to be doing. When my son kept saying, ""Hey- can you look at this real quick?"" I didn't immediately feel anger and frustration because my attention was being yanked away from whatever I was reading. I just looked at what he wanted to show me, and then WENT RIGHT BACK TO WHAT I HAD BEEN READING.... CALMLY. 
It's been absolutely shocking to realize just how completely pervasive and destructive my symptoms have been in every aspect of my life. 
I never doubted I had ADHD. I was always painfully aware, yet I STILL let some part of me tell myself that I was probably exaggerating the degree to which my symptoms were interfering in my life and I probably COULD just learn to try harder, apply myself more, and Just Do The Thing. It has been such a relief to find out that none of that was the case and that there is another, better way to live and experience the world. 
I'm deeply proud of the strength, grit, and resilience I've always shown and this has actually made me feel better about myself because I am shocked at the improvements I was able to make and the things I've been able to accomplish (though much later in life than most people and still not to the same level as many people). 
Before, if I'd think of something I wanted to do in life, I'd immediately lower my expectations and think, ""Well, that's probably not going to happen- but maybe SOME DAY!"" It's been bittersweet, but I finally feel like I'm one of those people that get to have big dreams, too.  It really *is* just a matter of me applying myself, and now I actually have that ability."

Can someone tell me if it sounds like I might or if I am off here? I know this sub can't diagnose obviously but I am just wondering if it sounds like it's worth looking into medication.

I regularly find new things that I love and get SUPER into them, then quit the next day or next couple of days. One example is I went to a coding bootcamp and spent 80 hours a week writing code and LOVED IT and picked it up super fast. Then I finished and didn't code for a couple months except for 1 or 2 days and those days I remembered how much I loved to code and did it for like 10 straight hours, only to not touch the project again. I am now back into it and over the last month spent 3 weeks coding every day all day loving it, then the last week I can't get off reddit to code even when I know I should. 

My whole life, I get super super excited about things (like coding, learning guitar, new language, working out, reading, fishing, investing to name just a few), and then quit after a couple days for something else new. Coding is the one thing I've managed to keep coming back to enough to get pretty good. But even then, it's a couple days of hardcore learning, then just nothing, then I remember it again and repeat.

I also always forget little things, like switching the laundry, or if my wife gives me 2 things to do I forget the second one after doing the first. No chance I remember more than 2, and I usually ask her to write them down. I have to repeat her when she tells me so I can remember. When she's talking I 'hear' her but I have to try so damn hard to comprehend it. 

I never notice things that are really obvious to other people. Like a furniture rearrangement in the living room, even if I get asked what changed. The garbage is spilled on the ground when I need to pop something in the oven. I step around it, but don't put 2 and 2 together that the garbage is spilled because I was so focused on putting the thing in the oven.

I've started 100 books in my life but only ever finished 1 (an audio book), I've gotten addicted to watching twitch for 10 hours a day for a 2 month period then haven't watched an hour in the last 6 months.

One time in college I took a friends Adderall just to see what it felt like and I finished all my hw and cleaned my whole room in a couple hours. Start to finish. It was amazing but I just wrote it off as me being lazy. I really resonate with what some people are saying but I also don't want to come off as just a lazy person who is blaming it on ADHD."

I took my first Ritalin pill today and i couldn't believe that was how people lived all along.,"I take 30mg of Vyvanse every day. I’ve been on it for almost one month and all I can say is wow. The first time I took it I was very confused because my head was completely clear and I had max 10 thoughts at once and I knew what every thought was.

The euphoria was insane. So insane that I cried because I haven’t been that happy in years. Being 18 and being genuinely happy for the first time in a long time was incredible. To think something so small can change my entire perspective of the reality I live in was mesmerizing. I was extremely excited to keep taking it from then on.

Since I’m one month on it I can confidently say I haven’t experienced that feeling since. Sadly, my body got used to it rather quickly but I’ve definitely been happier and more satisfied with what I’ve got going on in my life.

The only downsides is that once the Vyvanse wears off you get quite tired and extremely irratible. For me sounds the feeling of clothes and just the way things looked pushed me over the edge. But something that’s nice is that it doesn’t happen every time you take it.

I recommend taking Vyvanse 100%. It’s also very good at controlling appetite for BED (Binge Eating Disorders). It was actually first used for BED, then years after it was approved by the FDA as a ADHD medication."

I take 40 mg of extended release Ritalin and there is a period after taking my medicine that I feel SO CALM, happy, worry-free and significantly less anxious that I feel GUILTY that I feel that way. I have been SO CHOCK FULL of anxiety, depression, rumination, etc...that when I take my medicine I have guilty feelings that I don't feel those things and I wish my medicine would last longer. I don't feel the peak of the prescription for too long. This could totally sound like I am getting high, ha...but in relation to the original post, I had NO IDEA that people felt this way normally! What the heck?!?!?! What have I been missing for my whole life? My anxiety was SO BAD as a small child onward. I found ways to cope, but most were debilitating at times. I want to feel that way as often as I can! I can make better decisions and just be an all-around better person. It's amazing! My kids love me better when I am happier, too!"

I took my first Ritalin pill today and i couldn't believe that was how people lived all along.,"Thanks for the advice. I'm mostly happy because I was able to see that doing things wasn't supposed to be that difficult, in the past I always asked my friends how could they study for hours without getting bored or stressed, and they told me they just did it, that it wasn't that impossible, and I ended up just thinking I was a lazy person without enough willpower to study.

I felt relieved to finally know what it is like to be normal."
I took my first Ritalin pill today and i couldn't believe that was how people lived all along.,Does anyone know WHY it happens that way with the medication?

I took my first Ritalin pill today and i couldn't believe that was how people lived all along.,"Yes. This.  The way I described it was like in Star Trek/Star Wars and finally coming out of faster than light travel to be able to focus on what was immediately around me.  I had that effect every time I took a pill for the first week to 10 days.  After that it went away and I was scared the meds were not working.  In reality, my therapist helped me realize that i was not noticing it anymore because my brain had gotten used to operating at less than light speed all the time."

I took my first Ritalin pill today and i couldn't believe that was how people lived all along.,"This is similar to my story except I stopped taking it in elementary school (3rd grade) because my parents thought I was having a reaction to it (I was really just afraid of a terrible teacher) and fell far, far behind and had to try 2-3 times as hard as everyone else just to pass. I started taking medication again my third year of high school and I was so happy and sad at the same time because I knew that if I had just continued taking it from elementary school, I would not have had to struggle for what felt like a lifetime off medication as a child.

I am very happy to hear that testing for ADHD early is strong and accurate this days for elementary school kids."

I took my first Ritalin pill today and i couldn't believe that was how people lived all along.,"I got into med school before realizing how dysfunctional I was/am. I was able to squeak by before by studying ALL the time. I wasn't capable of organizing my life, so I just did everything: if a class covered material from chp. 11, I would read the entire chapter over and over until it sunk in. This strategy worked, but it was inefficient, and I was neglecting almost all other areas of my life. I tried to use the same strategy in medical school, but it was impossible. There are just too many responsibilities to overcompensate for all of them. It worked for my first year before burning out. That's when I found this sub and learned of the sxs of ADHD and executive dysfunction."
I took my first Ritalin pill today and i couldn't believe that was how people lived all along.,"So, to put into context, I live in Brazil, and here all federal and state universities are free, but you have to be above average on the national high school exam or apply on the middle of the year with a similar test,  those are elitist exams that target knowledge that you only learn if you're on private schools or did a pre-college 1 year course. I always studied on public schools, and they are very easy to pass, because the government doesn't want to spend more than the necessary money on you, then I failed my NHE and all college applications, I was stuck, but a friend of mine told me about a free pre-college course thought by some students of the second best university in south america, I applied to that and fortunately passed, those guys were the best teachers I had to this day, I owe them a lot. Fast-foward to November 2017 (11 months after finishing high school) I felt more ready than ever to take the NHE again, a test divided in 2 days, 90 questions and 5 hours of duration per day, and one essay on the first day, it felt like torture, but that was probably the only time in my life that my willpower was strong enough to keep me going, when the results were in, I passed in a federal university in computer engineering with almost the bare minimum score, but I got so freaking happy."

I would pull all nighters every few days and I would take advantage of pass/no pass systems. I failed a ridiculous number of exams but the long and arduous assignments throughout semesters carried me through. I also had to beg my professors to let me into the major despite not making the GPA cutoff which worked. As for computer science in general, I find it easier to do than any other STEM field because it has less required readings.

I started Lex in September and at first it seemed like it helped my ADHD. Over the past 7 months I gradually lost all of my motivation and drive and gained insane brain fog. I stopped wanting to take care of myself. I lost interest in my favorite hobbies; all I wanted to do was sit on my phone all day scrolling through social media. My ADHD meds weren't nearly as affective as they used to be. I thought I was developing depression. The Lexapro was the last thing I thought could be the culprit because it seemed like it helped my ADHD at first, but last week I started cutting my dose in half (5mg to 2.5mg) and I already feel so much more alive and motivated.

So what happens when you add ritalin is that dopaminergic signalling is massively increased, which your body finds strange, so it decreases the amount of dopamine receptors to try to bring the signalling down to where it was, as that's what your body thinks is right. But it doesn't do this completely, and the result is long term medications causing a slight increase in signalling. This is what causes opioid withdrawals - your body makes less of its own opioids and decreases the receptor count so that when the external source is taken away, the body is left with less stuff that can bind to less receptors, which throws the whole pathway out of whack.

Sorry that wasn't a great explanation, I'm struggling for words today. The way the body maintains homeostasis is through feedback loops - in a similar manner to how aircraft will point downward after a gust makes their nose point upward. If it didn't, one small perturbation could throw everything off."

Concerta is the same thing but It stretches that 4 hours to 12 hours by lessening it's effect. I needed more effects so I took more than 1 on somedays and thought I would have an heart attack lol.

Stimulants can cause euphoria in *anyone* the first time they try a therapeutic dose. It is literally one of the side effects.

I took my first Ritalin pill today and i couldn't believe that was how people lived all along.,"I would describe tolerance from 2 perspectives. One, being how ""good, euphoric, speedy"" I feel. And the second, being a tolerance in terms of what happens when I DON'T take it for a handful of days.  


The good feeling is still there, still productive, and still able to focus. It's just that you feel it creep up a bit rather than slapping you with it all at once. Im also on vyvanse which is time delayed instead of adderall (in most forms) are insta-release and hit you quicker/harder). So I wouldn't worry too much about not being as proactive down the line. The med will still do it's job.  


It's the SECOND thing, (not taking it for 3,4,5)  days where I see the impact of tolerance the most. I am prescribed to take it every day at certain times like most people, and I've found that if I skip a few days over a holiday weekend or whatever else that distracts me from needing/taking it, then it hits me super hard when I do take it again and it's almost uncontrollable and I feel like I'm on speed or damn near close to a ecstasy jigging feeling. Which is great if I want that, but I don't. I want to focus.  


The body seems to ramp itself down QUICKLY when you stop for a few days altering the balance of chemicals in your brain and leveling off the norepinephrine and dopamine levels back to normal. So that 3+ day break is basically resetting your brain back to ""never taking the adderall"" so slapping it with a full dose after the break is a little hard for me.

It worked at first, kinda, but I needed increasingly larger doses until it was maxed out. They moved me to Vyvanse after that and its been gangbusters ever since.

I would be so frustrated knowing that I was stuck with one ineffective med option.

One thing that someone mentioned before was getting involved in clinical trials and volunteering for experiments related to ADHD treatment. They signed up with universities and clinics related specifically to ADHD and ""social disorders"". It would put you smack dab in the middle of the hub where new treatments and medications are being tested and developed in your country. Probably your best chance of trying something new. AND you will make contacts/learn new resources from people in the field for future possible treatments."

I took my first Ritalin pill today and i couldn't believe that was how people lived all along.,"Unfortunately, yes. A rare, but not *that* rare side effect (I think the packet said a couple percentage points above placebo for 300mg, maybe like 6 vs 2%??). It didn’t come up on my googling about side effects before taking it though and I didn’t know it could be permanent, but turns out that it very much can be. Lots of people with my exact same experience. 
Doctor never warned me, but if I’d known it was a possibility I would’ve never tried it - or at least been way more vigilant and caught it earlier to get off it earlier. I ( naively) assumed a side effect would be temporary and if I got one I could just stop and it would resolve itself, but that assumption was incorrect. 

Honestly the tinnitus has been one of the most difficult things I’ve dealt with, but I’m slowly getting more okay with it. Knowing I’ll have to deal with it for the rest of my life though and that it could get worse is stressful - had it get worse after a loud wedding where I forgot my earplugs and didn’t have the sense to leave. And that I can’t use headphones and music in the way I used to - music was always a big help for me doing things with my ADHD, and I still try and enjoy it but I listen to a fraction of what I used to, when before music used to be my favorite thing."

I took my first Ritalin pill today and i couldn't believe that was how people lived all along.,"At what point should I continue to seek an increase my dosage (within doctors parameters of course)? For example, I started last week on adderrall 2.5 mg 2x a day. Doctor instructed me to increase as needed to 20mg/day (whether all in the morning, or split up throughout the day). After a few days that 2.5mg in the morning and 2.5mg in the afternoon wasn't really doing much, so I increased to 5mg in the morning and 5mg in the afternoon. Today is the first day I'm trying 7.5mg in the morning and 7.5mg in the afternoon. I'm about to take my second dose for the day in about 20 minutes, and I actually feel the mornings dose still working, whereas the past several days it had worn off at least an hour ago. For this dosage, I feel a good desire and follow through for productivity, but no ""move move move"" like I did my first day on 2.5mg. The Doctor is going to check in with me in a month to see how it's going and if I need an change in dosage or a change in meds.  

How do I know I may need to change my dosage after a month? Will this increase in focus become a baseline? Or will the increase in focus fade off and I may need higher dosage? 

I guess I'm not 100% sure on what I should be looking for as an end result. Am I looking for a constant desire and follow through with productivity and focus, or will that fade too?"

We get worked to death, and while I don’t personally do this (especially with meds, and it’s always clear if it’s meds), I know people who do. In all likelihood it was a substitute carrier who did this, subs are expected to work 60-72 hours a week in most places due to staffing issues and sometimes cut corners they shouldn’t. You can call the USPIS or just call up your local post office and complain. In all likelihood you’ll just be getting someone chewed out and maybe written up, but nobody will lose their job over it thanks to the Union so don’t feel bad about it. They deserve to be chewed out.

USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,"I was home. Next to my door. I have a Nestcam, they never came to the door. The package says it's a controlled substance. 

I posted here as I thought other folks on adhd meds might know if that's normal, as replacing stolen controlled meds is a nightmare."
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,"Ps I cannot pick up my meds locally, which is why they're handled by a specialty pharmacy now. I ran out of local options , as no one was stocking my dose. I was under the impression that USPS did have special handling for controlled substances."
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,This guy works for usps and forges signatures
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,"That's not forging then:) if you authorize them, then it's fine."
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,"USPS can not sign your name in any circumstances.   It's a US Federal law, not a guideline people can ignore.

Also I'm not finding any info on USPS having permission to not get signatures during covid, in fact, I found the opposite on USPS web site:  https://about.usps.com/newsroom/service-alerts/pdf/usps-continuity-of-operations-03-20-2020.pdf

That says, I quote:  

>Effective immediately and until further notice, our employees will follow the temporary process below 
for signature service items. This process applies to all letter carriers: 

>• Avoid ringing the doorbell when possible. Knock on the customer’s door. Avoid areas that may 
be frequently touched when knocking. 

>• While maintaining a safe, appropriate distance, employees will request the customer’s first 
initial and last name. 

>• For increased safety, employees will ask the customer to step back a safe distance or close the 
screen door/door so that they may leave the item in the mail receptacle or appropriate location 
by the customer door. 

>• If there is no response, employees will follow the normal Notice Left process. 

>• If there are delivery points on the route where social distancing recommendations are difficult 
to follow, alternative delivery methods can be explored.

None of that says anything about signing the document/letter and leaving it."

USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,"Honestly, this is pretty common for the USPS. After shipping thousands of items via eBay, stuff like this happens all the time. Honestly, be grateful you received your meds. At least once a month I get a customer who says 'the tracking says delivered but it's been 2 days, I still don't have it.'"
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,"Honest to god they may have filled that out at the office. Some people just want to be done and go home you know? I try not to judge people for shit like that, because solidarity with my Union brothers and sisters and all that, but with people’s meds it’s kinda ridiculous."
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,I used to fill out all of my pink slips before leaving the office. You have no idea what kind of time crunch they have on carriers once they leave the office. Every minute is scrutinized. (I’m no longer a carrier because the pressure was so intense every day.)
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,"They for sure didn’t get rid of all full time workers, I can assure you that is literally impossible. The way the contract works is you *must* have a regular carrier assigned to the route your house is on. That person is required to be a full time employee. “Part Time” as a carrier really refers to the fact you don’t have your own route, and so are not guaranteed 40 hours a week. The only way your mail would only be getting delivered by part time carriers is of your route is an Auxiliary route (a route that is too small to require 40 hours of service a week, and so has no Regular carrier assigned to it). The postal service’s current biggest problem is a staffing shortage, so good on your city if their part time carriers are struggling to get hours. That weirdly means the system is working. Most places “Part Time” actually means 15-32 hours of mandate Overtime."
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,Jesus. He’s not gonna make it. He’ll quit before his knees give out.
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,Not controlled substances. I can't even use the same prescription month to month.
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,"That really sucks, I guess you'll just have to develop a personal relationship with the USPS folks then so they know not to fuck up your delivery. Really unfortunate to havo no other option, I'm sorry"
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,"I just read an article today about legit pharmacies not always knowing themselves that they are distributing counterfeit pills. 

I'll try to find the article, if you like?"
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,Its my opinion
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,"Did I say something inappropriate? Everything I wrote is true. There are literally former post office workers in this very thread saying the exact same thing. I'm a former government worker and union member, it's a depressingly familiar story."
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,"lol!  I needed that laugh :)
I wasn't worried about it being handled w care so much as the potential for it being stolen next time it's dropped off without a signature when it says it requires a signature of 21+. Sounds like I should let the post office know and move on."
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,Which is exactly what they said?????
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,"Nope. They have to sign in their own name. You authorize them to sign on your behalf in their own name. There are good, historical reasons for why (the short version is that it makes fraud harder and it makes life easier) but all it really means is that you only sign your own name.

Even when you're witnessing to someone's signature (for example, say you recently had a stroke and can't write properly yet. You make a mark (usually an X) in place of your signature and at least two people sign as witnesses that you made that mark) you sign in your own name."
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,"Perhaps my postmaster told us wrong, but we did not require signatures at my office. 🤷‍♀️Wouldn't surprise me honestly, she was eventually let go."
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,"So I looked it up, and while I am not enrolled, you have to apply the signature for every package, it doesn't just auto sign for your deliveries. But It sounds like this practice of leaving meds is becoming typical based on other commenters."
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,I would say that the staffing shortage is due to the USPS shooting themselves in the foot. The fact that new hires aren’t considered usps employees & get no benefits is crazy. I can see why they have a huge staffing shortage.
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,"That's what I meant sorry bout that. Been many years since I did rural route. Could just be this area where I'm at. I'm smack middle of city now and different carrier everyday, along with being trained every couple weeks. Used to be was the assigned and very rarely ever switch out."
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,"I was honestly surprised that Optum was able to mail these. My doc has to call in a new scrip every month like you. I am in CA, but I'm still floored I can get em by mail."
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,"Really? They can't be expected to read the giant ""MUST BE SIGNED by 21+"" printed on the damn scrip? I filed a complaint yesterday."
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,Please do. I googled and only found an article about Optum themselves uncovering fraud elsewhere. Also an article from Pfizer about how to identity a legit online pharmacy. I may not be searching the right terms
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,My opinion is that you must be a very unhappy individual. At least leave productive comments.
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,"I'm sure it was all true. It's not that. 

You sounded a bit 'wound up' is all"
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,definitely!!!
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,"No. Forging a signature is signing someone else's name, regardless of authorization. If Alice authorizes Bob to sign a for a package on her behalf, the Bob is to sign thusly: ""Bob"". Not ""Alice"". If Bob were to sign ""Alice"", that would be forgery."
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,"That's exactly what I said...?

It's called a mandate or power of proxy or sthing in the direction (I def know its name in German - Vollmacht - and in Hungarian - felhatalmazás). On this mandate, depending on what you need it for, you may need two witnesses to sign, and in certain situations, you have to carry the mandate with you."
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,It's different to not require signatures versus someone signing your signature on your behalf because they couldn't reach you
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,"They’re starting to fix that. I know, at least on the rural side, it got bad like a decade ago when the Union couldn’t agree a contract with USPS, so it went to arbitration. The arbitrator cut substitute carriers pay by like $10 dollars or something and took away health benefits, and what do you know everybody quit. The pay is back up to $20 an hour starting out, and you get health insurance. City side you are guaranteed to go full Career with or without a route now after 2 years which is a big win. Honestly it’s still a great career in this job market, but you have to go through hell for at least 1-2 years before it gets good."
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,"Being a Rural Route in the middle of a city makes what you said make a lot more sense. Probably less than ten full routes in your office on the Rural side, so your office probably needs way fewer substitutes to cover all the routes. That means less hours."
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,What what what?! Once I get my dose figured out I am going to ask my doctor about this
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,"I mean I agree, they should do their damn job properly, but you get more flies with honey than vinegar if you know what I'm saying. Especially if theyre your only option for obtaining your meds."

USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,I offered you an alterative perspective that might make you less strung out if you adopt it to some degree.
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,Yeah I was replying to the other person...not you...
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,"My point is that you always, _always_ sign in your own name. _Never_ anyone else's. If (for example) my grandfather hands me his credit card so I can go pick up a cake in his stead, and the terminal asks for a signature, I sign as ""darkwater427"", not as ""grandfather"". Then, when my grandfather is looking over his records, he knows that it was me who made that purchase. He has indirectly authorized that. He's all square. But if I instead forge _his_ signature, now he has no idea who signed, only that he didn't--and now someone is impersonating him."
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,"Actually, during Covid FedEx was allowing their drivers to sign for packages that required signature with a “C-19” en lieu of a recipient signature to decrease exposure so many drivers weren’t obtaining signatures for packages regardless of if the recipient was available to sign or not."
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,"It’s $20 across the board irc. One of my friends has been with usps for 7 years & is a supervisor. He said it isn’t worth getting into the postal office now, it’s sad. My friends dad was a carrier for 35 years & he loved it."
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,We have guys stacking a 5 pound part on a pallet every 2 minutes for 20 dollars and hour. Gets full benefits after 90 days. I couldn't imagine waiting that ling without any benefits.
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,"Gotcha. I thought you were applying sarcasm or something :) Text tone is hard to read. I am also wondering if this was a substitute deliverer, as I've signed for non med packages at my door before with no issue."
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,"It doesn't change the fact that if Alice authorizes Bob to sign on her behalf, Bob signs as Bob. Not Alice!

On documents where it matters, there's a space for declaring who it is you are signing on behalf of. Because the signature isn't for describing that. It's for verifying authorization and authenticity. Not identity."
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,"We get it, we got it, everyone got it. Years ago. You can stop and breathe bro"
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,"Yes. That's not a correction to what I said. Thank you for further info, though"
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,"Once you get your own route it gets better. And it’s only $20 across the board for non career employees, once you go career you get bumped up to $25 an hour, with yearly increases. That’s where I’m at now. Pay scale tops out at $90,000 per year on the Rural side, not 100% sure what it’s like for City carriers. It just takes you 15 years to get it that pay.

Also you couldn’t pay me enough to be a supervisor. And they don’t pay anyone enough to be one. Most of the carriers in my office make more than our post master. That’s the beauty of a Union Job. But supervisors get treated like shot by upper management, have to be a massive dick to their employees as a matter of policy and get paid less."
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,Omfg I was agreeing with you
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,"Really? When I had looked on their website it said $19.90 for a carrier. IRC it was city, living in the NE."
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,No need to get upset.
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,"That’s what you start at as a non career employee. Once you go career you get scheduled raises. City side is still hourly, but I think per year you top out at a guaranteed $75,000, maybe more. I’m a rural carrier so I’m not sure how city side works. Also the benefits are fantastic. Good health insurance, tons of paid time off (can be hard to schedule if there aren’t enough subs to cover people’s vacations), and protection from being fired thanks to the Union. Also a pension if you stick around the full 30 years in addition to retirement plans like 401k’s and stuff. Like I said, it’s a pretty great career in this job market, but starting out is at least 1-2 years of living through hell."
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,Thank you for your in-depth explanation!
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,"Bubble question here: in my postal code, there are two roads with the nearly the same name. Both are Cliffview. One is a Street, the other is a Drive. Anyway, I live on the Street and we constantly get the Drive mail and sometimes have to track packages down when they get delivered to the Drive. While getting your meds delivered to you may be great, I would be too nervous about it being delivered to the wrong place with all the problems I've had. Anyway, here's my question: what can I do in this situation when I've already complained several times? I feel my only option is to get a people to sign a petition to change the name of one of the roads and pressure the county board of supervisors. (I know this is an adhd board but you presented too good of an opportunity to ask.)"
USPS forged my signature and left my Ritalin,"Honestly one thing that super helps is putting a laminated note or a note covered in tape in your mail box. That will really help subs to know to be on the look out for that issue. Maybe mailing a letter to the other address to ask them to do the same. If it’s happening a lot your route is either being run by subs a lot, or you have a bad mail carrier assigned to your route. The first can be helped a bit, the second is kinda just a shit situation that can’t be helped. A shituation if you will."

A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"That's just wrong in so many ways.
Broken down, kids need it to stay focused in school, so they have a fair chance to get a degree matching their intelligence, not their disorder. And then you should stop taking it, while you need to manage your entire life instead of just some hours in school? Nah, better not. 
I'd love to live in a world where I won't have to take it, but that's on another page. 
Only talking from my perspective."

A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"I’m 51 and I take methylphenidate, which is the generic form of Ritalin.  I don’t know if I could have a job without it, at least not one that requires focus and concentration.  

I took Ritalin when I was in elementary school, but I stopped by high school (I’m a little mad that my mom let that happen).  I realized I needed medication for my ADHD while trying to write my dissertation for my Ph.D. in my early thirties.  I was having such a hard time focusing long enough to write a string of coherent sentences.  Getting on Ritalin was a life-changing decision, and I’ve been on it ever since.

By the way, my elementary school principal told my mother when I was diagnosed with ADD in the early 80s that I would never be anything more than an average student.  I now have a Ph.D.  I won!"

A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"What's going on with pharmacists and their issues with Ritalin, Adderall, etc lately? 

Are they just really tired of the supply chain issues and taking it out on customers? 

I feel like this is the 3rd hostile pharmacist post I've read this month."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,It is FDA approved for children and adults. Both short-acting and long-acting as well as modified release. That is ridiculous! Unless it interacts with another one of your medications that pharmacist was ignorant for saying that.
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"I’ve heard something similar from 2 doctors, but it was more that on average it tends to be prescribed to kids more than adults than it being specifically for kids."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"I started taking ""ritalin"" in 1996 and have been taking it ever since (I'm 70 now). Your pharmacist is rather clueless."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"I take Ritalin and I’ve only had one problem with a pharmacist in the 19 years I’ve been taking it. A pharmacist decided he needed to put me through the third degree before filling my prescription. It was about a year ago. I looked at him square in the eye and said “ I’ve been taking these meds for almost 29 years and have never had any problems. Now you suddenly feel the need to question me?” He insisted on calling my doctor. A week later he  re-filled the prescription, and I switched to a different pharmacy.

Pharmacists trying to be investigators and judges… just give me the fucking meds I’ve been taking for 19 years!"
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"Damn, I’ve been taking Ritalin since…2002. 

I think it was filled as methalyn back then and sometime around 2010 it started to become methylphenidate. 

I’m 33 now, married with children. I guess I take a child’s drug? Lol. 

My wife would argue I become a child when I don’t take it or forget to take it. Usually around 1 or 2 pm I’m getting wife reminders to take the pm dose cause it straight up affects her day / night. 

I take two 30 mg LRs a day or I will turn into a race car."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,ADHD doesn’t get magically cured when you “become an adult”. That pharmacist seems naive and probably tells people all kinds of stupid shit that is more offensive than that. Some people can’t help commenting on everyone else’s lives.
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"I take a chewable medication that is almost certainly made for children. Functionally, its the same as the non-chewable version (concerta). Never had a pharmacist tell me it isn't for adults but I'd probably just laugh at them if they did."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"There are still doctors and pharmacists that think adults can’t have adhd. I don’t know why they think that. It doesn’t go away on your 21st birthday so I don’t know what data they have to back that up. Obviously it is not the case.

Like others have said I would report it. It is discriminatory and it is medically incorrect. 

I was told that since I am not working I don’t need it. Well I’m not working because of my adhd. If I am without my meds I don’t function."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"Hi, I'm a pharmacist and my husband (45) takes Ritalin. Kindly, that person needs to keep their opinions to themselves. 

Unfortunately, many retail pharmacists don't really ""get"" ADHD. I can honestly say having a spouse and kiddo with it has taught me so much about it."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"Recently diagnosed and prescribed Ritalin, mid 20s."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"I’m 44 and I take Ritalin twice a day. Works wonders. I heard people say adults can’t get Ritalin - but that was in the 90s…it’s been a while. 
(I’m in a country with health care, so no insurance needed though. I’m sorry it’s so much harder for you)"
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"I’ve been taking it for the past few months and am very happy! Adderall didn’t feel like it made any difference when I tried it, but Ritalin makes enough of a difference that I’m content to stick with it."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"I actually went to a new primary care doctor a few years ago and they told me that everyone in their Health Network would absolutely not prescribe any ADHD medication for adults.  She said their board decided there ""isn't any evidence for adult use of stimulants to treat adult ADHD"" and basically said they, professional doctors, don't believe adults have it. Lol And this was a large health care system in South New Jersey. I was like damn that's crazy cuz I was just seeing a psychiatrist and I was diagnosed by him and being given medication so you're saying that as doctors you don't believe in science and they kind of just didn't have an answer lol I left. 

I've been diagnosed since I was 5 years old lady Don't tell me how you think you know more than my experience and millions of other doctors."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"It's not really up to them. If the doctor prescribes it, their job is to issue it."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"I took it for several years. I had constant problems because my insurance companies kept denying coverage, saying ritalin is for kids. 

I did the computer testing and it showed my symptoms were well controlled on it, so they are full of 💩."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"First of all, it’s not a pharmacist’s place to tell you that. That’s between you and your doctor.

Second of all, Ritalin is for all ages."

A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,Trash ass pharmacist. I would be so fuckin incompetent at my job without my adhd meds
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,That’s a lie. Adults can take it. I’m living proof of that!
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,Change pharmacies. Generic Ritalin should cost less than $20 per month. Report him for practicing medicine without a license.
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"I take Ritalin, my Doctor actually told me generally adderall is what they use for adults but, and Ritalin they usually do for kids, but we would start Ritalin first."

A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"Report this to the board of pharmacy in your state. Also send the pharmacy a cease and desist from an attorney outlining your demand to not be discriminated against for your age. 

This was factually incorrect and discriminatory counseling from a licensed professional and should be treated as such."

A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,Literally millions of adults take Ritalin
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"I've met quite a few pharmacists that think they are open heart surgeons. I bet when they get home they do the washing-up with a stephoscope around their neck, a surgical headlight and an assistant to pass them the sponge, liquid and scouring pad.

Doctors receptionists are just as bad.

Stop asking me personal questions with other people around and stop trying to usurp qualified doctors or even the person experiencing symptoms requiring medical intervention.

The last time this happened, I was having an emotional crisis and gave up trying to save this doctor's receptionist any embarrassment. It had taken me weeks to even leave the house for more than a quick trip to the shops because I couldn't stop crying.

She insisted on asking me to give details of my issues in front of a half full waiting room. Every time I went to speak I had to stop because the tears were coming. In the finish, having given her ample clues that I was near breaking point, I just let it all out and sobbed uncomfortably in front of EVERYONE.

It's not comfortable for most to see a then 57 year old 6'2"" lump of a man reduced to a broken mess, let alone being put on public display like that. I'd tried so hard to hold it in because I hate inconveniencing people in any way.

Within minutes I was sitting opposite a most excellent doctor who was full of compassion and patience. As for the inhuman receptionist, I hope that a lesson was learnt that day."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"That pharmacist really needs to get back into the current research because it’s sounding like he’s still living off the DSM-4 diagnostic statistical manual) from 1994… it has since been updated in 2013, but most doctors and pharmacists still believe that ADHD is only for prepubescent boys and that it goes away. Yeah. We now know better. But this pharmacist clearly doesn’t. 

Also, that is really overstepping all medical boundaries for the pharmacist to say you shouldn’t be taking a medication that was explicitly prescribed by your doctor…if this ever happens again, please report them because this can make for very unsafe pharmacy interactions for others that aren’t as strong to the criticism. I know with my ADHD, my RSD gets triggered really easily when it comes to people making negative comments about me medically and this could’ve sent me into a meltdown in the store."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"I work in a pharmacy and if you can report this you should. I know reporting might sound like it doesn’t mean anything, but district managers hate 1 star reviews and especially if you mention “medical mis-information” I bet the DM will look at it. That Pharmacist is full of crap and they know it, placing their biases ahead of patient welfare isn’t right."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"I was taking it until I was 30, when I switched to Vyvanse, then adderall.

I used to have insurance that didn't cover any adult ADHD meds for adults without prior authorization, and barely subsidized it even when I got one. It was terrible, and it's why I'm not on Vyvanse anymore (generic adderall is much cheaper)."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,Well Ritalin is actually the one the usually first start us on because it’s traditionally not as strong as adderall.  Pharmacist just didn’t want to fill for you and a lot of places give pharmacists the ability to refuse to fill if they decide to.
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,It’s the first thing my doctor had me try after I got my diagnosis as an adult lol. Didn’t work for me well but that was literally his first step.
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,Wouldn’t give me Ritalin here in the uk. Was advised it’s not suitable for adults
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,I take it! It’s common to provide for kids because it’s shorter acting (this is what my psychiatrist told me) but that’s also why I use it because other adhd stimulants were making me jittery and I wasn’t sleeping well at night. Ritalin works wonders for me because it fully wears off by the end of my work day which is what I wanted. Other ppl might need a longer lasting stimulant if they need the boost for other life functions etc. Everyone is different and meds are just meds. You can take whatever fits you best.
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"Non related but bad Parma exp 

I have one pharmacist refuse to fill my Adderall prescription because I am on testosterone replacement. He think I am Adderall and steroid abuser. And I was literally just using 10mg IR a day. 

Unfortunately legally they can do that so I just switch to another cvs."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"In Belgium, it's literally written on the leaflet because of the side effects :s (not for adult) .I think It's mainly related to the heart and I had those strong side effects (increase heart rythm ,feeling like I took an extra large coffee of 2 L). Because of my family predisposition with heart problem, I had to change my treatment and it's a lot better."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"I’ve been on Ritalin since 1994, with a few brief detours to try out Dexedrine, Atomoxetine, Concerta, and now Vyvanse. I always ended up back on Ritalin - until now maybe, I’m loving the Vyvanse! 

(If you’ve always been on Ritalin and haven’t tried others recently, it might be worth considering because things have changed a lot. I’m 2 months into Vyvanse and I have none of the anxiety inducing side effects or sweating I get with the Ritalin. I don’t quite get the same kick in the pants as when the Ritalin hits which I miss in some ways because it was a good way to get me moving, but the way the Vyvanse works feels so much kinder to myself. It’s a slower more constant motivation and I don’t burn out my energy all at once.)"

A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"When I was trying to find the right med my doctor at the time told me Ritalin was initially meant for children and it does not always have the same effect on adults.
That being said it made me feel horrible. But I doubt it was because of my age and more just not the right med 😂"
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"I’m 27 (28 next month) and I take Ritalin! I took adderall in high school and college, just recently (a couple years ago) switched to Ritalin because for me it’s less intense than adderall and I don’t need that if I’m not in school. So I was put on Ritalin when I was about 25!"
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"I think in the US especially, Adderall is the first line med for adults. Maybe they meant you should try Adderall"
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,I’ve been diagnosed since I was 14. I was most recently on Ritalin during the pandemic and I was 37. My insurance had no issues covering and I never had an issue from the pharmacy.
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"Not only am I a 38 year old who takes Ritalin, I’m a 38 year old who *just recently started* taking Ritalin.  And holy hell has it made my life better."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"Definitely not true, however... Kids usually react better to Ritalin and adults better to Adderall. But it's not a 100% like anything else. like how some people are better with instant release and others better with extended. 

I'm assuming your pharmacist was misinformed/miseducated based on old rhetoric regarding ADHD."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"Not ritalin, but I and many people I know are prescribed various other stimulant meds as an adult. My insurance stopped covering vyvanse and I have been considering switching to an ER ritalin instead of the IR adderall i’m currently prescribed. 

Drugs in general are incredibly stigmatized, despite how many people they help when used correctly, while we cheer on food addiction. The pharmacists are either giving me weird looks or giving me their success stories, not really anything in between but it is generally the former and not the latter. 

I wasn’t diagnosed or medicated until my adult life. There are other factors but I was never able to keep a job or just function as a ‘normal’ human in general until I began taking vyvanse. I have had the same job for almost 3 years now, I’m actually able to do the things i need to do in life. It has truly been a blessing."

A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"I was told by my doctor that Ritalin tends to be less effective in adults so we would try Adderall first. Adderall has worked so far, so I haven't needed to worry about Ritalin."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"32, and I recently started a low dose of Ritalin, 5mg twice a day. My psychiatrist didn’t bring up any other medication, just started me on it. It’s been beneficial so far."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,That information that adults shouldn't take Ritalin is 100% fictional.
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,I take Ritalin. Definitely helps me focus and prioritize in order to do simple things like laundry and cleaning. Adderall helps with that too but it also makes me wired in a feels good way that scares the crap out of me. With Ritalin I don’t feel that. Plus Ritalin is supposedly easier on your heart.
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"None of the stimulants have any age limit. Not even in your 90s, by then they might conflict with some health meds might drag you off them"
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"It’s my understanding that Ritalin is one of the shorter acting stimulants and for some reason this makes it better for children than adults. I’m a lay person, so I’m not sure why. If you’ve been on stimulants since you were a child, you should have very little trouble finding a psychiatrist to prescribe you a longer acting medication like adderall or vyvance, or even Ritalin if that’s what works for you."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"Wow.

My pharmacist has never given me an issue and I started Vyvanse in my late 40s, when I was diagnosed.

The only thing they do, is make sure that I get appropriate medication counselling, since I am on a bunch of other medications."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"I’m 33 and my prescriber didn’t want to try Adderall or Vyvanse and instead kept opting for Ritalin.

A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,Methylphenidate is...
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"I’m sorry you’re going through this. I go through this all the time with insurance. I was diagnosed with ADHD at 24 years old. Went through the proper testing with neuropsych. I’m 38 now. Been on and off meds since diagnosis, but the last 4 years have been so hard to get my vyvanse covered because I’m over 17 years old. They don’t think adult ADHD exists and it’s so infuriating. Without medication our lives can completely unravel- bills being paid late, messy homes, performance issues at work, time management… I wish they’d stop being so judgmental."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"I take methylphenidate 20mg 3 times a day, and I was born at a time when the year 2000 was a future time full of space stations, robot butlers, and the like."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,Shits not for humans nvm adults!
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"My opinion, and it’s not broad, it’s not the rule, is that a lot of adhd meds for Me personally conk me out sleepy wise so bad. I’ve come to the conclusion most adhd meds that do that are meant to placate adhd kids in school so they’re “easier to handle” in class. And as an adult it doesn’t help me focus or do work. Just zombifies me. So in my mind the meds are for kids (but not in a good way)   If it helps you function as an adult I think you should be able to take it obviously but I just wana pose why some people have that mindset. But every body and person is different. Advocate for yourself. You don’t have to put up with doctors who won’t help you.   Medical discrimination is real and getting treated for smth like this is such a bitch most of the time."

A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,I know some insurances only cover certain medications for children and not adults
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"I don't follow about the driving. The only difference between being medicated and unmedicated while driving is that I am much less likely to be distracted in my direction. I tend to go on autopilot and drive wherever my habits take me instead of where I should go. But I always use Google Maps now, so it doesn't change that anymore.

I prefer driving without my Concerta. I am freer, able to relax, enjoy the scenery, and let my mind wander. While medicated, I concentrate too hard ( at least on my way home from work) and can't decompress.

I also don't like being medicated while watching my kids on the weekend. Taking my meds makes me want to be efficient and accomplish task. Impossible while watching 2 toddlers."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"I take Adderall, and that sounds ridiculous and ignorant."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,I take the generic version (26 and working full time).
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,Forgive me for asking but is there a reason you can't use adderall?
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"Give them the joke “yeah, adults don’t need to drive safely” and then see whether they laugh or explain. 

It’s always possible that a pharmacist is being a smart shopper.  

That’s an older medicine, and many people may want something similar, but with slower release, or some other advantages.  

Often a pediatrician will be slower to change prescription habits.  They have good reasons to value a long safety record."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"I see so many posts about pharmacists taking unilateral action here. Do they have that much authority? If my psych and GP have given the go ahead I can take my script to any pharmacy and they dispense without any conversation, because *two medical professionals* have decided I need it."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"My best-friend since the 8th grade was diagnosed as a child, and I had no idea he's been taking Ritalin. Him and are both 40 somethings now. 

I was diagnosed at age 38. I only found out he's been on Ritalin after I told him I was diagnosed.

I raised so ignorant on mental health I didn't know why I was friends with certain folks until now. 😅"
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,I take it! I love it.
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"It’s not that Ritalin isn’t for adults. It’s that some insurance plans have age limits to only cover for people under a certain age. Like <25, <21, <19. So patients over that age need their doctor to appeal the insurance by submitting clinical documentation showing that the prescription is medically necessary and meets plan requirements.

As a pharmacist, I don’t understand why the pharmacist would assume that a drug wouldn’t be covered before running the claim. Even if it wasn’t covered, generic Ritalin is one of the least expensive stimulants if you were to pay out of pocket."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,Im taking conserta. Its ritalin for adults. It not working as well as vyvanse did for me but the pharmacy has np problem getting vs vyvanse.

A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"So, the overall effect is milder than amphetamines. But having taken both, I absolutely prefer Ritalin. It works quicker, I don’t feel “cracked out” or crash when I come down, and I absolutely get what I need out of it. I’m also 34 and took Adderall for years. They may prescribe younger kids diagnosed with ADHD Ritalin more, because of the milder stimulant effects, but that doesn’t mean it’s FOR children. What an irresponsible thing to say."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,I took Ritalin as a kid and the muscle tics were too much for me.  I take generic Vyvanse now and it is my favorite out of everything I've ever taken.
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"Pharmacist here. Understand I know nothing specific to you so this is generic, and not advice.

It’s not a weird choice for adults who have been on the same medication since they were kids, or who were prescribed it before prescribing guidelines were updated to the point when I learned them a while ago(or usually the last time the doctors read them), or who have tried other medications with less success first.

If you haven’t practiced in retail a lot, it may seem weird. For everything I’ve seen working, unless you have other serious priority health conditions, or show signs of possible side effects effecting your QoL, I personally wouldn’t bat an eye at this.

If I do have a problem, I’m calling your doctor to suggest/work together to figure out, the best course before I talk to you."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"I  62/F have just been diagnosed Adult ADHD, started taking Ritalin for the first time in my life in May.

Ive been on other stuff throughout the years and they are the one things I can feel working and not have side effects so I trust them. My problems have been the stupid work or school crap which is annoying because I have more then just ADHD and daily life is struggle enough in genral. Recently since phycs doctor above her didnt like to do stimlets over certian amounts they dropped my amount and (accdently or not not sure) changed me from ER to imdeate release and I HATE it and am not functional at all. It feels pretty much like im taking nothing 🥺.  Sorry if it seems like nonsense rambling I tend to do that 🤣
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"That makes absolutely no sense to me. Did he provide any context or literature for this claim? As an adult you should be able to choose any medication you see fit to manage your symptoms. Doctors can have a weird superiority complex in my experience - it's a double edged sword though. If you play to their superiority complex and make them feel like the smartest person in the room, you can generally get anything you want. Narcissists manipulate others yet ironically make themselves extremely easy to manipulate..."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,It's like saying band aid or cold packs are not for adults. We do grow and change but fundamentally we are still using human bodies.
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"This is a prime example of the difference between a doctor and pharmacist. I’m of the opposite opinion meaning children should not be labeled ADD/ADHD until they’re at the very least puberty stage and just because the drugs are effective doesn’t necessarily mean they’re necessary. People who don’t know about these disorders tend to directly relate them with schooling although they directly affect more serious problems than just learning. I’ve been on and off of different medications since I was roughly 11 and having a stable dose of Adderall for the past 8 years has helped me in different situations and I’m sick of know it alls who think that stimulants only help because they make you hyper when as having ADHD treated with amphetamines does almost the exact opposite and I become much more calm and less mentally distracted. I honestly could care less about people’s opinions about my treatment and chalk it up to being misinformed of not only ADHD but also how medications work for people who do/don’t have it.

      My point is that if you feel like you have these disorders talk to real doctors who understand the symptoms and treatments available because these medications should be given with great care and knowledge. Also professionals who know the difference between ADD and ADHD because while similar issues are usually treated with different medications. Pharmacists are not doctors and need to focus on their jobs and leave their personal opinions to themselves where they belong."

They know a tiny bit about a lot of things. Also, if you are not in the person’s shoes then they don’t understand. For example, I work with 6 pharmacist. 3 are very knowledgeable about ADD meds, mainly because they are either themselves ADD or have kids that are. The other 3 have zero knowledge of them. They maybe could name the drugs in that class but that’s it. Normally Ritalin is the go to for kids and Adderall is the go to for adults. That’s the standard or at least the starting point. That’s where I think they are coming from. I have worked with some amazing pharmacists and I’ve worked with some shitty self serving, holier than thou, I know it all, everyone is below me pharmacist. Each person is different. Just like depression meds. It may take forever to find one that works and after a time it may stop working and you have to change."

A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"True, unfortunately there's always the one bigoted pharmacist that causes so much harm with their views being placed on patients"
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,What alternative did you choose?
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"Morning. What dosage Vyvanse are you on please? I'm currently on 54mg concerta and 2 x Ritalin 10s topups .I'm still under the care of my psychiatrist and at my next appt (still titrating the correct dose), I want to ask if we can try Vyvanse for comparison because in NZ, once the psychiatrist is happy that we have reached the correct therapeutic dose, he signs you over to your GP and they prescribe from guidelines the psychiatrist sets.  The wait lists in NZ for a psychiatrist are over a year and very hard to even get an appt. If I don't ask and I'm signed off by him, Im stuck with just methylphenidate and I need to be certain b4 this."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"I guess there is no reason.  I did try it out for a month once bc the pharmacy I used ran out of ritalin, so I got Adderall for a month.   It really didn't seem that much different to me."

A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"Even when I'm not at work, I still need to drive sometimes. And the last time I checked, being unable to focus while driving isn't a good thing."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"i feel like the pressure of work forces more productivity. like at work, u have a boss, ur jobs at risk if u slack off, people are depending on u... but when ur at home living day to day life, the stakes are far lower, there's nobody to make u do anything. plus the burn out aftermath of pushing through your work/school day. when i was working i felt like a brainless zombie by the end of the day, no motivation to do anything but lay in bed and rot. its not even the physical fatigue that gets u, it feels like theres tar mucking up ur brain cells"
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"Not to mention that managing friendships and relationships is work too, that happens to make one’s life more emotionally sustainable. If someone needs meds to help with that part of their lives as well, or even just enjoying their time alone more, that’s completely valid."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"Finally got back on meds last week after four months off them. My lawn has finally been mowed, driving isn't overwhelming, I can do a thing for more than five minutes, the list goes on. Yeah it helps me when working, but my personal time is where it really shines."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"I don't even work (disabled) and I need my meds every day because it's not just about being productive, it's about being stable and happy and mentally healthy (or healthier, at any rate)."

A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,Holy.. I couldn't imagine organising a family without medication.
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,Adderall pissed me off for no rational reason at the weirdest of times.
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"back in high school i thought i might have it at one point, so i mentioned it to my GP at the time. she told me it was impossible, because it would've been caught in childhood, and i was too quiet/calm. said my struggles in school were just due to me not trying hard enough, and i should ""make sure i was getting enough sleep""💀

i was diagnosed 10 years later, on accident, while seeing my psychiatrist for depression and anxiety. treatment was unsuccessful, and SHE brought up the possibility. i'd love to go see that old hag doctor and shake my vyvanse in her face like a maraca😹"
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"Yep, I was told “that should’ve been diagnosed in childhood” after she assessed me for depression instead of ADHD, which is why I scheduled the appointment in the first place."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,They literally teach that in med school still. Its crazy.  Never heard the women thing tho
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"No, afaik it's entirely different. Ritalin was first approved for children. Later, when science figured out that adults could have ADHD too, that approval was extended to adults. But - according to my doc - the leaflet was never updated.


At least for me, it works, and I'm 41 lol"
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,I love this! I  slugged through my PhD without meds--it took me an extra two years and almost killed me. Thank the universe my advisor believed in me. I was diagnosed 6 months ago and meds have been life changing for my family and my career.
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"They are educated on the medications interactions with other medications yes. However their uses as/for treatment not always. 

It's probably uncommon for adults to be prescribed ritalin, but not unheard of. What a pharmacist would fail to understand is that it's common for ADHD to follow an individual into adulthood, especially in more severe cases. Those are things pharmacist wouldn't know or understand."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,I would not make that claim in the US. there at least a doctor has to actually go to doctor school and not be just some guy off the street who showed up when the store opens.
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"My friend is a cardiac nurse, and I can tell you it takes a specific type of personality to do what he does."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"Yep. Refuse to hold people to standards, assuring many more patients have sub-standard experiences as well. That’ll show em.  Literally like saying thoughts and prayers. Does nothing to address the problem."

A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"I’m currently on 40mg. I started at 20 and noticed some improvement, and significantly more at the 40. I’m going to go up to 60 next week and see if there’s more improvement, and if not, I’ll drop back to 40."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,Typo.
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"unmedicated driving was impossible for me! because i know how ditzy and easily distracted i get, zoning out, all the risks involved made me so anxious on top of it that i'd start shaking/vibrating behind the wheel. it kicked me into fight or flight like i was in a state of emergency.

i've been practicing again upon finally being medicated, and its SO much easier, almost effortless, and is actually kinda enjoyable. i dont think i'd ever be able to get my license if i'd never gained access to my meds."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"I also need to pay bills, clean, run errands, help family, and most importantly… give time to myself."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"Never even put it together about the driving. 

Before I was medicated, I had several wrecks (one serious single vehicle wreck, multiple minor fender benders - I was at fault in all of them), 5-6 speeding tickets (all minor speeds, but after I had just crossed into a new zone/hadn't noticed the speed limit signs), expired tag ticket, messed up a motor because I didn't realize I had the car in low gear, backed into random stuff, ran out of gas at least once every few months...man, this is worse than I thought once I type it all out 🥴😂

I was telling a friend the other day that it had been about 10 years since I've gotten pulled over or had any issues that were vehicle related. And whatdya know? I've been medicated for about 10 years! 😂"
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,A dangerous thing
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,Work is also structured which forces me to do what I need to.
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"I literally find myself reaching out to friends twice as often when I’m able to be on Vyvanse. It’s wild. (Thanks, med shortages!)"
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,I take 1 dose for the first 4-6 hours of work. Then I take one dose when I’m off work and try to be productive at home. Does anyone else split doses?
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"You know — I think it makes perfect sense that words like “productive” are stigmatized as capitalist, particularly given that most people in developed countries are employees and their “productiveness” is about someone else’s profit. 

But as a freelancer — and I assume this goes for someone in your position too in many ways — it’s like… my desire to be productive is the thing that I use to create the life I want to live? Productivity is a rare resource for me that I cherish dearly?"
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,Totally 100% agree. Or only put your glasses on when you need to see. 😂
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,Good stuff!! 💪
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"Yep. And when I’m medicated, doing those things actually feels GOOD."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"yeah, and i've only got one! but being in charge of an entire separate person is a struggle, esp with only 1 present parent. i lucked out cuz shes really smart and well behaved (for a 7yo😹). i couldn't imagine multiples, ESP unmedicated... 

i wasnt even diagnosed til 2ish years ago, and it was reallyyyyyy a struggle when she was younger. if i'd been treated before it prob would've been much smoother sailing. i think she has adhd as well, but shes inattentive like me, so i've had a hard time getting her a dx

it feels crazy that i've managed to keep her alive, happy, and healthy when i *really* think about it. like ive been raising and caring for an entire human since she was a 3lb little nugget. especially since my parents absolutely sucked. i was in charge of 3 other kids at her age, and i absolutely cannot imagine that for her"
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,Yes! The psychologist who diagnosed my ADHD told me that it can frequently be misdiagnosed as anxiety and depression in women because it often presents differently in women. We started exploring it when no antidepressants would work for me. Wellbutrin even made me manic!
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"Ah, that makes much more sense. In this guy’s case, its probably more of an issue of being on the medication for so long that your body/brain tolerance to it is pretty high, and therefore could use a change up in his medication."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"Ooh boy, it took me 8 years total, but its done now and I'm getting hooded on Saturday. I was so fortunate with the grace my PI gave me. 


It's been crazy though. It wiped out a good portion of my anxiety and depression by just being able to be a functional human being. "
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,May I ask what medication works for you?
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,In the US Pharmacy school is intense. Not an easy feat
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"Well, the UK must be different then because the pharmacist I dated some time ago went through several years of education and training and worked dam hard through it all. (Definitely didn't just walk off the street) 
It was impressive whenever she went to the GP for medication. The GP would essentially ask what she would like, and they would just write the prescription for it."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"Pharmacists have doctorates in the US and take the same undergrad courses. For starters they take 2 semesters of general chemistry, 2 semesters of organic chemistry, 2 semesters of biochemistry, 2 semesters of medicinal chemistry, 5 semesters of pharmacotherapy, 4-5 semesters of pharmacology, and 2-3 semesters of physical chemistry. Also most reputable med schools have their drug therapy (pharmacotherapy) taught by pharmacists because they under say and they are the drug experts. So no they aren’t just someone off the street."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"US pharmacists are quite well, and rigorously educated.  Just like any other profession there are some who are wrong and/ or think they know more than they do. Remember not everyone graduates at the top of the class.
I have had good experience with many pharmacists who do know more than the docs about medication, they have been helpful in how to manage or avoid side effects, what time of day is best to take certain meds."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"That’s just not true. In the US, pharmacists are degreed medical professionals with years of training. As others have said, this pharmacist was just wrong. 

 https://www.forbes.com/advisor/education/healthcare/become-a-pharmacist/#:~:text=It%20takes%20about%20six%20years,high%2Dearning%2C%20impactful%20career."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"No. Pharmacists are doctors, too- not MDs but they have a doctorate of pharmacy. We should be calling them Dr bc they are. 

Also, they 100 million billion percent know more about drugs themselves than doctors. That’s why we have pharmacists. Honestly, filling rx is easy, knowing all the info about drugs and their interactions and contraindications, etc, is *hard* and we absolutely need highly trained doctors to dispense rx- hence, pharmacists. 

It’s just that this pharmacist was wrong, like mentioned by others."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,PharmD programs aren't some easy thing to breeze through. 😂
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"Pharmacists have a doctorate in the US. It is a doctorate of pharmacy rather than medicine, but they are most definite not just some guy off the street."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,Thank you very much for answering. Hope it goes well for you xx
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"I have the same thing! I was never a bad driver but I still got sweaty hands every time i drove (which was still a lot)! 
After being medicated driving is way more relaxing and more fun. I thought I was the only one that had this lol!"
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"Same.  I mean I’m not dangerous, but I could easily end up in another state."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"I have always said that, just like a glasses restriction, my license should have an adderall restriction. But I feel like you might need it more! Ooofff."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,Yep - structure and accountability (stressful or not)
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"Yeah, im in a similar boat. On top of that, i get the feeling I’m just easier to be around when im medicated, bc I can just set my own shit aside and listen to my friends’ problems"
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,That's actually why I like my XR.
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"I raised a daughter, who was dx with adhd at 35 and I wasn’t dx until 59."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"15mg Adderall XR with an optional 5mg Adderall IR boost around 1pm. 

I started at 5mg XR and felt no change, then 10, no change, and 15 was like a whole new world. I seem to process the XR more quickly at certain times in my menstrual cycle so my Psych suggested an optional bump depending on how I am feeling. I've been doing this for 5 months and it has been completely life changing."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,It’s the same in the US.
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"VERY few people think of themselves as a *bad* driver. Most people think they’re pretty decent, better than average or even great drivers. That includes the bad drivers."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"To be fair, I got on meds around 25 so that is all spread across about a 9 year span. Still terrible, LOL, but doesn't seem quite as terrible across a decade. Or maybe I'm just trying to lie to myself 🤣"
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"Someone was telling me it feels like it lasts all day. I have to split my productivit energy between work life and home life. I give my job the best that I’ve got for the day. Ritalin and a cup of coffee every morning. I’m productive and behave myself for the first
6 hours of the work day and then I’m just fucking off for the remainder but all the most important things I need to do I do first thing in the morning."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,yeah.. her dad had it too (was actually dxed in childhood) so go figure. it'd be shocking if she *didnt* have it😹
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"I consider myself a bad and dangerous driver because of my lack of focus. It's actually had a massive impact on my life and I refuse to drive because of it, not from a lack of trying again and again."
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"Ritalin is apparently the shortest-lasting ADHD med. But if you like the way it encourages you to work efficiently and lets you turn off work brain at some point, maybe it’s a good fit for you! (If not, you have options!)"
A pharmacist once told me Ritalin wasn't for adults.... ,"I’m afraid to ask my MD for something “better” or longer lasting. I’m starting an 8 month data analytics course outside of work. I’m so nervous that I can’t make myself study at home the way I “make myself” get tasks done the right way at work. I’m efficient and thorough at my job and receive many accolades but by the time I get home I have no mental energy to sit and study, I usually end up dancing around my apartment, cleaning, or just all around letting distraction rule until bedtime."

"ADHD is not recognized where I live, and psychoactive medication (like Adderall and Ritalin) is illegal. How do i live my life?","I'm going to be a little against the ""Just try CBT"" because having done CBT with undiagnosed ADHD I found myself constantly slipping into a ""Crunch time"" of trying to get the homework done before every session which did not help my mental health at all.


I have heard better things about DBT, and now that I'm diagnosed my psychiatrist has recommended me to start some in the near future. That said, if you can find someone who specializes in either for application to people who have ADHD you'll go a lot farther than just to start taking it.


CBT does great for figuring out the ""Why's"" of how you think/react/cope with things.... But imo it was only useful for me for realizing that I had executive function issues already and that my depression and anxiety episodes where being triggered by decades of unmanaged ADHD."
"ADHD is not recognized where I live, and psychoactive medication (like Adderall and Ritalin) is illegal. How do i live my life?","If your country allows Wellbutrin, that could be an option to look into. It treats depression and BED."
"ADHD is not recognized where I live, and psychoactive medication (like Adderall and Ritalin) is illegal. How do i live my life?","I was unmedicated in college. Honestly, what saved me was having a study buddy. Someone to body-double with, it's like day and night for productivity. Bonus if they have the same classes/degree as you. Oops, now you have friends, too."
"ADHD is not recognized where I live, and psychoactive medication (like Adderall and Ritalin) is illegal. How do i live my life?","I feel you... I'm from India and although there is medication and therapy available for adhd there its just that... there's no awareness for it. When I was 16 i tried telling my parents that I have adhd and they gaslit me into thinking that I'm just making things up because they'd never heard of such a thing called adhd. they said that if I tried hard enough I could focus on my work. it was quite literally one of the worst days of my life. i felt how you feel. completely helpless.

I had the same dream of studying abroad but I barely managed to pass my high school exams (even failed one of them and had to regive it). after that point I knew that I just needed to get out of the country so I managed to get admission in a small uni in the UK (couldn't make my dream uni ofc) with one of my goals being to get an adhd assessment.

now I knew that UK had a free healthcare system that included mental health services, I just wasn't aware that the system was FUCKED. the wait time for an adhd assessment was three years and thats how long my degree is. so I literally wasted like 2 yrs in considering wether I want to get it done or not.

I'm in my third year now and honestly my adhd had me at my worst... I was failing assignments again, and my friendships were falling apart, so I finally decided to pay to get an assessment done. The assessment and medication has cost me quite a lot and I'm currently broke because of it but it's honestly been the best decision I could make. Ive started meds and theyre helping me out a lot but honestly it doesn't fix everything.

I'm gonna be honest with you... meds help but there are several ways to cope with adhd without meds. I'd suggest you look them to help you get through school. Hopefully you're able to get out of the country after school and then save up for an assessment. but trust me you can work with your adhd, I know its hard but you can do it. i believe in you

sorry for yapping 😭"
"ADHD is not recognized where I live, and psychoactive medication (like Adderall and Ritalin) is illegal. How do i live my life?","An answer you may not like to hear: 30 minutes of cardiovascular exercise at least 3 times per week, and cold water immersion have an extremely positive impact on my symptoms. This combined with therapy and meditation hits many of the most noticeable symptoms without use of medication."
"ADHD is not recognized where I live, and psychoactive medication (like Adderall and Ritalin) is illegal. How do i live my life?","1. Yes exercise!
2. An anti-inflammatory diet of no sugar and no flour helped me a lot.
3. Structure, structure, structure. Start building specific habit stacks (routines) for morning and evening. Start with a short list of tasks you want to get done, write them down and DO them every day. Start small and add to your lists as the tasks become routine. For instance , a PM routine might be 
Wash dishes
Prep coffeemaker 
Check or write tomorrow’s sched.
Pack tomorrow’s lunch
    When those tasks become automatic, you can add to or replace them with other habits you want to establish, like meditate or journal or study  language for 10 minutes , etc. 
Meds are really helpful for some people, but for me, these kinds of changes have been more important."
"ADHD is not recognized where I live, and psychoactive medication (like Adderall and Ritalin) is illegal. How do i live my life?","Dude--you can do things! For instance, your English is excellent!

"ADHD is not recognized where I live, and psychoactive medication (like Adderall and Ritalin) is illegal. How do i live my life?","Hey guys, I've been sitting here and reading through your responses and i just want to say that i really appreciate you all going out of your way to share advice. I'll be trying my best to routinely incorporate all of what you told me and if i notice results i'll be sure to let you all know. Thanks once again!!"
"ADHD is not recognized where I live, and psychoactive medication (like Adderall and Ritalin) is illegal. How do i live my life?",Exercise and caffeine if you can tolerate it. Caffeine has similar effects of meds but less effective and can fuck up your sleep.
"ADHD is not recognized where I live, and psychoactive medication (like Adderall and Ritalin) is illegal. How do i live my life?","A specific kind of exercise that can work (according to an ADHD book by Dr Russell Barkley I read years ago) is one that challenges your balance/equilibrium. Things like skating (inline, roller, ice), yoga, gymnastics, balancing ball exercises, and anything else that really gets your cerebellum activated.
The cerebellum is the part of the brain that, among other things, helps with proprioception and balance, and it somehow also helps with managing ADHD impulsivity and other symptoms.

I can attest that I only made it through college unmedicated because I would skate three times a week. It helped me immensely. The bilateral stimulation from inline skating also helped me process any emotions I was going through at the time.

Sending you strength. It freaking sucks to have to manage ADHD while unmedicated"
"ADHD is not recognized where I live, and psychoactive medication (like Adderall and Ritalin) is illegal. How do i live my life?","My advice is this: as other people have stated exercise yes. Use your phone to set alarms for absolutely everything. Make sure you have routines as much as you can. My next piece of advice this: do everything you can to graduate from high school and get into college abroad. Make sure you are going somewhere that does recognize ADHD, and get treatment there. Good luck :)"
"ADHD is not recognized where I live, and psychoactive medication (like Adderall and Ritalin) is illegal. How do i live my life?","Bro, I’m going through the exact same thing. In Yemen, it’s incredibly hard to see a therapist because people—your own family even—start treating you like you’re losing your mind. I’ve dealt with severe depression and anxiety for over six years. At one point, I couldn’t sleep for more than 2–3 hours a night for almost a year. It wrecked my life—I lost my job, ruined my relationships, and my ADHD spiraled out of control. That’s when I realized I’ve had ADHD for 25 years without knowing.

I only found out two years ago, but for a long time, I couldn’t do anything about it. I was too afraid of what people would say if I went to therapy. Then, after hitting rock bottom like never before, I felt like I was truly losing it. That’s when I finally built up the courage to see a therapist. But when I told him about my ADHD, he dismissed me completely. He said I was just being soft, that I didn’t resist enough, and that I was looking for excuses or trying to get easy access to meds. Bro, I felt so defeated, like everything I went through was for nothing. It felt like the end of the road for me.

A year later, I hit another rock bottom. I couldn’t take it anymore, so I decided to search for a therapist who actually understands ADHD. Can you imagine? There wasn’t a single one in my entire country. Just when I was about to give up, I found a new therapist about three months ago. She works mostly with kids who have ADHD, but I went to her anyway. It took a lot of effort to convince her that I had ADHD, but after multiple tests, she confirmed it. She also told me that Yemen doesn’t have access to the best medications for ADHD. She prescribed me a children’s medication (STRATOMOX) in higher doses as a last resort.

I was desperate, so I started taking it, even though it’s really expensive. Some weeks, I couldn’t afford it, so I had to stop. Honestly, I haven’t seen much improvement yet, but I don’t know what else to do.

I’m suffering just like you, and I hope one day we can both find a way out of this. 💔"
"ADHD is not recognized where I live, and psychoactive medication (like Adderall and Ritalin) is illegal. How do i live my life?","Lots of caffeine, adequate sleep, and getting to another country, perhaps for college and then getting meds there."
"ADHD is not recognized where I live, and psychoactive medication (like Adderall and Ritalin) is illegal. How do i live my life?","This will seem dismissive, but you handle it the same way everyone who lives undiagnosed (me for 40 years) or unmedicated (me for the past few). You do your best, you learn techniques for managing your challenges, knowing you have this disorder helps a lot.

"ADHD is not recognized where I live, and psychoactive medication (like Adderall and Ritalin) is illegal. How do i live my life?","I'm so sorry. I hope that you can move somewhere and get real treatment. I wasn't diagnosed until I was 40, so I know how you feel. I feel like I had to work so much harder than everyone else just to be at the same place.

My first ADHD doctor used to say that the things you do to help ADHD are like legs of a table, and that medication is only one leg. You might be able to function without the medication if you do enough of the other things - but medication alone won't help you.

Every small thing you learn to do now will help you later when you can actually have medication.

Some of the things that have actually helped me: 

Protein. Especially for breakfast. Try to eat a decent amount of protein in the first hour after you wake up.

Exercise. Cardio helps me the most. I started to really see a difference after I was doing an hour a day, several times a week. You don't have to do this all at once, and that might even be counter productive. Try to add in as much walking as you can, all throughout the day. Walking is so helpful, especially outdoors. But whenever possible, you also need to sprint, to make yourself breathe hard for a time.

Exercise part 2: walk while you study. When I took my notes, I actually wrote them as questions to ask myself. Then as I walked, I would read and answer my questions. This is how I studied, and for me it worked.

Avoid additives. Things like preservatives and dyes in your food and drinks. These are known to be bad for ADHD.

Fish. I think the research on this is not complete but all my doctors have recommended eating fish. This also helps with getting more protein.

Caffeine. I can't have it now with medication, but caffeine was a very big help to me before I was diagnosed. Just be careful not to overdo it. It's helpful while you have to be still and concentrate.

Sugar. It isn't sugar itself, but more about stabilizing blood sugar. I noticed my ADHD symptoms improved as I was working to stabilize my blood sugar for other reasons. To do this, I am careful to limit refined sugar and simple carbohydrates like white bread and white potatoes. When I have something like this, I eat a small amount and pair it with protein and healthy fats.

Find a calendar/reminder system that works for you and stick with it. Whatever this is. Every single thing has to go into this. I set calendar alarms on my phone for everything I need to remember to do, but my life is more simple now. At one point I used a bullet journal when I had a lot to remember and that worked quite well. For this to work, I had to get one that I could carry everywhere, all the time. Writing with pen and paper has always been effective for me.

Tweak everything. You have a unique and creative brain. Let it run wild. Find new solutions. Try many things. You are a scientist working to understand yourself. If you fail at something, then you have learned that part of your system failed. Don't worry about following any system except what works for YOU."

I worked with my own adhd, my children's adhd as well as worked in a school with students with adhd. There is a ton of information on youtube and reddit. But looking at adhd from a teacher standpoint one of my favorite YouTube people is Seth Perler. He works with students and teachers and uses a lot of things my school used. I really like his basic hands on and experienced approach. The second recommendation is movement breaks. We'd have kids squirming all over the place in class. We'd take a break, they'd run around, come back and can concentrate better. Run around the outside of the building, put in some gym time etc. Overall having a steady workout routine is good, actually have a daily routine/schedule to help your body, balanced eating is good, all the healthy stuff."

How do i live my life?","No matter what I would resist the mindset that medication will solve all of your problems and magically make you more productive and attentive because it won’t. You need to address specifically which ADHD symptoms impact your life and to what severity. As someone who went to college unmedicated and untreated, it is absolutely possible. You would just have to be more disciplined and more aware of meeting your daily needs before you can perform in school. College will require you to manage your health as well as your grades, but being prepared is the key. You should take this time to learn good coping skills to help you regulate your emotions. Take the time to learn how to take notes and keep yourself organized during class and after class. Also, if you have good friends and family, find a good support system so when you can call when you feel down on yourself. Always always always make time to eat sleep and do something fun for yourself, we are not motivated by normal achievements. We are not programmed to be good at forming habits so give yourself grace and extra time to do nothing if you wish. Skip a day if you must, but go tomorrow. 
You are an adult now, but that’s the best part!It’s entirely on you to manage it however you see fit. You got this!"
"ADHD is not recognized where I live, and psychoactive medication (like Adderall and Ritalin) is illegal. How do i live my life?","I have been through the same thing. Now I'm a medical doctor in the US.

I would suggest dealing with comorbid mental health difficulties(Depression, Anxiety..) , which are extremely common in ADHD. It does not have to be devere to become problematic. I never thought counseling would benefit me until I started it for adhd and dealt with other dormant problems too. It's very hard to focus when you have emotionally more important worries. It will make managing ADHD much easier. From my personal experience and lots of research managing ADHD is basically building an effective routine or eliminating the need for decision-making.

How I became efficient: My study period was tied to a family member's working hours. I had to leave and come back at a certain time with her and went to the library or coffee shops(which only were associated with studying).  I put a lot of effort into planning the whole week/month (depending on situation). I planned every hour for different subjects) study resources. every other hour was free, meaning I could do whatever I wanted, study, eat or play clahs royale. You should give you ADHD some time to express itself too ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|hug). If I could not study enough in dedicated time, even in periods of important exams. Its equally important to dedicate time to having fun. Basically control your time and avoid the greatest threat - procrastination.

A week before I started this routine, I could not imagine myself being so efficient and doing that. It may sound hard, but as long as you eliminate the need of frequent decision-making, its gonna go smoothly.

Last thing. Nicotine and caffeine are stimulants. Don't start smoking, that's gonna make your condition and health even worse, but using nicotine patches or gums  while studying can improve your focus. Simple advice but don't drink coffee after noon(at least routinely).

There most probably will be  some non-stimulant medications available and they are proven to be effective. Try to find a good mental health professional, don't delay it for years like I did. good luck!"

How do i live my life?","I think a big part of overpowering the ADHD symptoms is accountability, whether it’s through therapy, a journal/planner, or friends/family. I’ve realized in my own life that having evidence of my performance in front of my face motivates me to do better. If no one calls me out or I let myself get away with not doing something, I just won’t do it. But if someone says something to me or I look at where I’ve written down just how long I’ve procrastinated on something, that’s like a kick in the ass for me that allows me to overcome my bad habits long enough to get back on track."
"ADHD is not recognized where I live, and psychoactive medication (like Adderall and Ritalin) is illegal. How do i live my life?","It has been shown that Therapy can address ADHD. The primary and most effective way is medication yes, there are non-stimulant medication’s that can work. Strattera (Atomoxetine) is an ADHD med that, at least in United States, is not considered a stimulant. Though it does act very similar. I was on this for a long time and it worked for me very well, but I started to have side effects specifically with my stomach and if you’re a male possibly your testicles may hurt. (It is a real side effect to be clear) 
There are methods to address it without stimulant medication, I’m not gonna pretend that they are better or worse, but when it comes to -how do you live your life-; you do it with the best options available. I wish you the best of luck."

This is coming from a 45 year old dude who got his diagnose and medication 6 months ago. I've had serious struggles in my life but they made me who I am and I'm grateful for that. 

1. Structure Your Day: ADHD thrives in chaos, so fight back with structure. Use a planner, apps, or even simple to-do lists to break your day into manageable chunks. Focus on small, achievable steps—progress builds momentum.

2. Diet and Exercise: While medication isn’t an option, a healthy diet and regular exercise can greatly improve focus and mood. Look into foods rich in protein and omega-3s, and find a form of physical activity you enjoy—it’s free and effective.

3. Find Support: Seek out online communities for people with ADHD. There are countless forums and groups where people share advice and motivation. It can be comforting to connect with others who truly understand your struggles.

4. Study Smart: Use techniques like the Pomodoro method (working in short bursts with breaks) to stay productive. Minimize distractions and consider studying with a friend who can help keep you accountable.

5. Long-Term Planning: Channel your energy into working toward studying abroad in a country that recognizes ADHD. Treat it like a project—research, prepare, and plan your next steps. This can give you hope and a sense of control.


You’re in a tough spot, and it’s okay to feel overwhelmed. But don’t let this define you. You’re resourceful, and by taking small steps now, you can set yourself up for success. You’ve already taken the first step by reaching out for help—keep going."

I know discipline is not always easy with adhd, but having something fun you can do after a task is a good motivation. Also, doing studying and hw physically next to another person works wonders. Caffeine can also help manage symptoms for some with adhd, but it's possible to be sensitive to it and become unable to drink coffee/tea/etc. so be careful lol."

They are not as effective or healthy, but caffeine and nicotine can be used for self medication.  You are young enough there's also the good old anxiety and adrenaline method. Again not healthy option, but if you can convince yourself deadlines are actually a bit earlier, you can use that pressure to motivate yourself. Using real deadlines just sucks... 

For studying, I like to use a scent that cues my brain it's sit and focus time. (I use vetiver). When I get distracted I refresh the smell and try again. Basically training myself like pavlovs dog. Also, if you have any control over what you are studying, go for something you are interested in and care about. Much easier to stay focused when the material is interesting to you."

Also ensure that you are getting adequate sleep, hydration, and vitamin intake. May also want to check out some magnesium.

To clarify, I don't advocate for any of it, but I want to communicate that I relate to how you feel.

Desperate isn't a strong enough word for how I feel to get better by any means, but I'll add to the refrain here that you should try to incorporate cardio into your life, consider suspiciously pseudoscientific seeming supplements like magnesium, fish oil, and vitamin D, and try the non-stimulant medication if that's an option. You're also probably not consuming enough protein, so if you can find protein powder I would choke down some of that or eat more meat/eggs/legumes etc.

We also know that omega-3s and vitamin D supplements do show significant benefit when studied.

When it comes to supplementing with supplements, rationing out coffee through a morning can help. Divide a cup of coffee into four shots that you take each hour instead of just drinking it in the first hour. This method has been tested on general population and shows that people stay more alert through a morning. Test yourself and adjust amounts to see if you get a benefit.

Other DIY option some use is nicotine in the form of lozenges or patches. Have to be careful with this one as nicotine becomes addictive when you exceed 6mg per day roughly. So, you could use up to three 2mg nicotine lozenges each day as a form of stimulant to see how they work for you. Without the negative compounds found in tobacco, nicotine itself is a lot like caffeine, but can work better for some people. Just stay very low on doses. I’ve done this and found it helped some when I was already engaged in the work I wanted to do.

I'm not saying don't get medicated, you make your choices, but know that you can do without it. ADHD isn't only weaknesses, it gives you superpowers if you can channel them. I'm not the only one here who did it. What you absolutely need is : a system.

Your productivity system must be tailored to your needs and what makes you special. My system is simply morning and evening habits, and using apps to store and track all my tasks, projects and notes.

Identify your problem, try solutions, keep what works and reject what doesn't. Assemble what suits you into a system : build habits (Atomic Habits by James Clear was a life changer), have timers and alarms on your phone, take written notes, have flashcards for your studies, review them every day. If you're taking the bus, read your flashcards. Taking a dump? Read your flashcards. Doing the laundry or washing the dishes? Buy airpods and listen to a podcast. Memory is a muscle, so is discipline. Do less: work smarter, not harder, optimize what you're spending time on.

The best tools are: a calendar, a notebook, and friends that support you. Build discipline like it's a muscle and build your personal productivity system like it's a master work of art.

"ADHD is not recognized where I live, and psychoactive medication (like Adderall and Ritalin) is illegal. How do i live my life?","Hi, that sounds very difficult. 

Exercise is one of your best options but some types of exercise are more effective than others. 

There is a good scientific literature now showing that Exercise that has higher cognitive demand or is open skill (reactive) is generally significantly more effective than low cognitive demand or closed skill. 

Examples of open skill/higher cognitive demand exercises include ball sports (including racket sports), martial arts (evidence for Taekwondo), dual tasking (e.g. balancing on one leg and throwing and catching a ball or counting down from 100 in 7s). 

I’d find some sport or exercise that you enjoy or are willing to engage with that is a bit social. This way it’ll help you do it consistently and reap the greatest benefits. 

Using breath work and working on sleep hygiene does a lot of good too. 

Hope that helps."

"ADHD is not recognized where I live, and psychoactive medication (like Adderall and Ritalin) is illegal. How do i live my life?","Well the medication is great, but doesn't do everything for you; I may be wrong, but I belive that cognitive behavior therapy has the same efficacy of the medication (in compared studies - but not being a ""instant"" thing). Also for a lot of time people all over the world haven't access to medication. I'm 28y old (finished my first degree in college without knowing anything about having the disorder), just recently I got my diagnosis and started the treatment.   
Many of us, for years self medicated (may it be ilegal drugs), like drinking a lot of coffee or tea. You can try doing exercises, specific diet, supplementation, etc.   
Try reading books about ADHD that brings a different approach/ non pharmaceutical. Hope you do well!"
"ADHD is not recognized where I live, and psychoactive medication (like Adderall and Ritalin) is illegal. How do i live my life?","Caffeine in the morning. Avoid sugars and simple carbohydrates as much as you can. Get a book on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and if you can, get a therapist. Nothing cures ADHD, not even medication. But therapy alone is, in my opinion, better than medication alone. All the usual healthy living advice is doubly applicable for people with adhd. Get enough sleep, establish routines, marry your calendar app, drink caffeine when you wake up….stop about 10 hours before you go to bed."

"ADHD is not recognized where I live, and psychoactive medication (like Adderall and Ritalin) is illegal. How do i live my life?",Didn't read post but try Wellbutrin. It's the only non stimulant medication that's provided me any benefits.
"ADHD is not recognized where I live, and psychoactive medication (like Adderall and Ritalin) is illegal. How do i live my life?","Hi OP, I was unmedicated for a long time. Stimulants are amazing for me in their longevity, and in that journey the routine I've found that works at least half-way is the following.

Do all the traditional things for your health such as exercise and quality sleep, apply whatever industry techniques of workflow and effectiveness of your best peers. Doing this effectively will be nigh impossible, except I had a routine of nicotine gum/lozenges and caffeine in form of coffee/lozenges. Caffeine is well known, but I'd like to speak a little bit about nicotine.

You are under 18, so this may be difficult, but nicotine gum is usually less regulated. I started off doing 2 mg gums, and the technique is to chew to feel some stimulation, but unlike normal gum, cease chewing when effect is achieved. 

Doing the two is not like Adderall/mixed amphetamine salts in longevity, but if you dose it right, gets there in terms of effectiveness. Nicotine in this form offers very little negative effects, beyond vasoconstriction, and typical side-effects with caffeine as well. I highly recommend that you at least try it once. Speaking of addictiveness, I've heard all across the board in terms of personal feelings of addiction. Just speaking for myself and a large group of friends, the behavioral desire for nicotine is the same as desiring alertness, rather than a bodily need. Others have said similar things about coffee as well, so I would say explore, but as always, tread carefully. 

Like any medical advice, I am not an MD, nor YOUR MD. But I found the above an amazing recipe that worked well to get me to this point."

I know people can really benefit from CBT, but I had a bad time with it. My issue wasn’t discerning unhelpful or false thoughts and beliefs from the ‘good’ thoughts and beliefs. It was having all the thoughts all the time. It didn’t matter how realistic or compassionate my beliefs about myself were, they persisted. In fact by making me more conscious of them, CBT actually made me more aware of negative thoughts and gave me the feeling of being ‘bad at CBT’ because I was having them."

"ADHD is not recognized where I live, and psychoactive medication (like Adderall and Ritalin) is illegal. How do i live my life?","I feel you, I’m going through the exact same thing. In Yemen, it’s incredibly hard to see a therapist because people—your own family even—start treating you like you’re losing your mind. I’ve dealt with severe depression and anxiety for over six years. At one point, I couldn’t sleep for more than 2–3 hours a night for almost a year. It wrecked my life—I lost my job, ruined my relationships, and my ADHD spiraled out of control. That’s when I realized I’ve had ADHD for 25 years without knowing.

I only found out two years ago, but for a long time, I couldn’t do anything about it. I was too afraid of what people would say if I went to therapy. Then, after hitting rock bottom like never before, I felt like I was truly losing it. That’s when I finally built up the courage to see a therapist. But when I told him about my ADHD, he dismissed me completely. He said I was just being soft, that I didn’t resist enough, and that I was looking for excuses or trying to get easy access to meds. Bro, I felt so defeated, like everything I went through was for nothing. It felt like the end of the road for me.

A year later, I hit another rock bottom. I couldn’t take it anymore, so I decided to search for a therapist who actually understands ADHD. Can you imagine? There wasn’t a single one in my entire country. Just when I was about to give up, I found a new therapist about three months ago. She works mostly with kids who have ADHD, but I went to her anyway. It took a lot of effort to convince her that I had ADHD, but after multiple tests, she confirmed it. She also told me that Yemen doesn’t have access to the best medications for ADHD. She prescribed me a children’s medication (STRATOMOX) in higher doses as a last resort.

I was desperate, so I started taking it, even though it’s really expensive. Some weeks, I couldn’t afford it, so I had to stop. Honestly, I haven’t seen much improvement yet, but I don’t know what else to do.

I’m suffering just like you, and I hope one day we can both find a way out of this. 💔

Sorry for yapping too 🤣"
"ADHD is not recognized where I live, and psychoactive medication (like Adderall and Ritalin) is illegal. How do i live my life?",I feel you bro. Grew up in India. No mental health care.  I was diagnosed only in the US in my 30s. Inattentive type and I pretty much developed a lot of coping mechanisms to deal with it. When all those started failing is when I got medicated. Hang in there.
"ADHD is not recognized where I live, and psychoactive medication (like Adderall and Ritalin) is illegal. How do i live my life?","Cold water immersion. That is interesting. 

We had a pool at my old condo and when I swam in it by myself for like 20 minutes in the evening afterwards I'd have this stillness in my mind that lasted maybe half an hour (never measured it). The pool wasn't cold per se, being around 21 Celsius.

This is before my diagnosis."

"ADHD is not recognized where I live, and psychoactive medication (like Adderall and Ritalin) is illegal. How do i live my life?","It’s true in a way. My father was extremely strict with me, and while his methods—like threatening🥊🥲 me about bad grades or making poor decisions—might not have been great for my childhood experience, they did push me to succeed despite my ADHD. As a kid with ADHD, I struggled a lot: procrastinating, making mistakes, and delaying everything until the last minute. But thanks to the fear-driven motivation and adrenaline rush, I managed to get things done in record time.

I wasn’t perfect, but I did pretty well for someone with ADHD in school and life. However, things changed once I went to college and started earning my own money. Being far away from my father, I slowly lost control of myself. Without that external pressure, I didn’t realize how much I relied on fear and panic as motivators. Two years later, I hit rock bottom and couldn’t pull myself out, no matter how hard I tried.

Why? Because throughout my childhood, I never developed self-discipline. Instead, I depended on fear triggers that I couldn’t replicate or control. The irony is, I’m still grateful to my father. Without his strictness, I might’ve turned out worse. No hard feelings there.

Now that I understand my ADHD better, I’m working on finding solutions. It’s still challenging, but I’m determined to fix things and create a better future for myself."

"ADHD is not recognized where I live, and psychoactive medication (like Adderall and Ritalin) is illegal. How do i live my life?","Not an expert, but I think just switching off all hot water at the end of the shower could be effective. Just pushing through with it seems to do part of the work. Your brain has to adjust to avoiding thoughts of fleeing and going against other wants. It’s a lot like mediation in a way.

Talking about this has made me want to go back to the cold shower at the end ritual and I did feel more in control of what I wanted to do on days I did it. I also think running a cold bath and plunging could work without the ice. It’s gonna feel like a shock anyway. I have also done the cold plunges at the Korean spa after being heated up and it really is like a brain wash. Had to tap into all my meditation practice to focus on just one step in front of the other on the ladder getting in cause I hate cold water, but it worked and felt physically great for a prolonged time after.

I had a similar experience, except it was extreme anxiety that fueled me to succeed despite my tendency to procrastinate or not do things the way I should.

I suddenly was a lot worse at being productive and doing things on time, and I realized later it was because I no longer had that anxiety pushing me through it.

I have ADHD and while i am medicated, i do put alot of stress of my body, not for selfharm reasons but for strengthening myself. 

Sometimes i dont eat for a while, sometimes when im cold, i stay cold. Same for heat. At times, i dont sleep. Or hardly sleep anyway. Let your body adapt.

Unfortunately there are some psychiatrists(especially old school ones) that are resistant or afraid of prescribing stimulants. Sometimes it’s ignorance, sometimes it’s because they want to manage a co-morbid disorder first that means mimics ADHD symptoms (ex depression or bipolar), or they just have a tough love kind of approach and want you to “build your case”. Regardless it’s not a good approach. 

If I’ve learned anything after 20 years of treatment is that you have to make yourself informed about your condition (research the symptoms, reviews on meds, etc) and be resourceful like having multiple options with doctors.  In your situation I would definitely fill out that online screening he asked of you, go through with his follow up appointment, find and make other appointments/get on waiting lists, and explore telehealth options (which could be helpful to get the ball rolling on stimulants and then easier to switch to a local option). Keep in mind that some telehealth services say they treat adhd but don’t prescribe stimulants (so ask ahead). Some that are good options are ahead, done and adhd online.

"""Even if you do have ADHD, I won't give you any Ritalin""","Maybe consider reporting this doctor, this is extremely unprofessional behaviour. I have been to many psychiatrists in my life and not one mentioned that I might have ADHD. Like you, I graduated high school and college with fairly good grades and got by fine (albeit with a lot of stress and overwhelm). Doctors aren’t infallible and they also only have the answers for what they ask/what they tell you. Was this person an older doctor? He sounds like he is working from an older mode of being - adhd in the DSM-5 has broadened to include more inattentive symptoms and if he’s working from a “they’re fidgeting so they have it” mode then he’s definitely not going to believe you. That said, this guy sounds like a pretty big dingus, and hate to say it might be a sexism aspect, as doctors sometimes have superiority complex towards young female patients (even more so if BIPOC).

Also I’m in the field of psychology and overt behaviours aren’t always a great measurement of what is happening internally. Many people with adhd exhibit different behavioural symptoms with the same cause. Your doctor sounds stubborn as hell and maybe is just stuck on a diagnosis. That said, depression can cause difficulty focusing as well so it’s hard to say. The assessment centre I went to told me that 1 in 4 people have ADHD in adulthood so it’s far from being uncommon. 

There may be a couple of options for you:
1) if you are in post secondary, get hooked up with the accessibility department and they will aid you in getting a diagnosis. They may be able to help you find an assessment centre and apply to get a bursary to pay for it. 
2) talk to your family doctor to fast track you to a diagnosis or give you other options. Sometimes out of city options is the fastest option or if you’re wanting it fast and have the $$$ you can get a diagnosis very quickly through an assessment centre in the city 
3) file a complaint of the psychiatrist and request another doctor, one who specializes in ADHD. There should be an anonymous complaint line.  

The fact is you know yourself best, I’m not saying self diagnosis is always correct but I think you should trust your gut and get a full assessment to really make sure.

I agree keep looking for a different doctor. Even if takes 15 months, it's better than never. Make the appointment with the clinic now and if you can find somewhere else sooner than cancel it."
"""Even if you do have ADHD, I won't give you any Ritalin""","Better to take an appointment now with the proper specialist than going to one that will make you lose your time. Waiting is better than gaslighting. 

Idk how they call it in english, but I was diagnosed with ""douance"" which explains why even with all my disorder and learning disabilities I was a gifted students. This could be your case. 

I was doing well in school but my self esteem was getting lower and lower because I felt like I should be able to focus for the long exams like the other kids. I thought I was just not good enough. But I was lucky enough that my big brother got diagnosed in my early teen and my parents immediately saw that I could have it (like they thought years back but were told it was impossible by an unprofessional teacher). 

A lot of people get diagnosed as adults both my parents did!"
"""Even if you do have ADHD, I won't give you any Ritalin""","Yes, your doctor may be able to get you in sooner if he contacts the specialist. Ask your insurance , ask your doctor , or just look up specialists in your area . What state do you live in ? I’m in the USA and could recommend someone in my state if you’re here ."
"""Even if you do have ADHD, I won't give you any Ritalin""","He sounds like a piece of work. I honestly wonder how people like him are even psychiatrists. I highly doubt he even studied ADHD since he believes all these common myths rather than the truth. I’m sick of people acting like those of us with ADHD cannot get good grades or go to college. I got decent grades (mostly because I had a tutor). I would have gotten better grades if I was able to focus, but nope. I’m just lucky that I understood the work well enough to pass my exams. Then I went to college and it was hell. I could not focus on my work, attend classes etc and I failed. People with ADHD are not stupid. 

This guy doesn’t seem to believe ADHD exists, or is as serious as it is. I hope you manage to find a better psychiatrist, preferably one who specialises in ADHD. Good luck and I hope you feel better soon."
"""Even if you do have ADHD, I won't give you any Ritalin""","This psychiatrist isn't going to help you no matter what so don't waste your time going back. Even if none of the doctors who specialize in ADHD have openings, you can still keep trying other practitioners and hopefully find one that's not a total whackjob like this guy. Get on the 15 month waitlist and also talk to the clinic and let them know you can take any last minute openings on short notice (if you can).

I'm not sure how controlled substances work in Germany-- in the US you can't fill an rx unless your doctor is licensed to prescribe in the state you live in as a precaution against abuse. If possible, considering the existence of rail and cheap domestic flights, you could look into seeing a practitioner outside of your city for a diagnosis, and ask your primary care provider in your current city to prescribe the meds they recommend.

Edit: also worth talking to your primary car physician and ask if they will prescribe you meds if you saw someone privately in your city and they gave you a diagnosis and initial prescription. 200 Euros sucks but it will be worth it to get the help you need, especially if you can make that a one or two time cost rather than something you have to pay every month.

finally just want to underscore how invalid what he said was. i go to a competitive uni in the us and you'd be shocked at how many people here have undiagnosed adhd. female gifted children frequently make it through k-12 and even college undiagnosed due to the differences in how adhd is expressed which correlates with gender. and being academically talented makes it easier to stay under the radar. my k-12 gifted program required teachers to write up individual reports each year discussing academic but also social progress, and in retrospect these reports show very clear adhd symptoms, but they were brushed off as being antisocial/awkward and lazy. it didn't help that both my parents grew up with undiagnosed adhd and saw my extreme procrastination and other behaviors as normal."
"""Even if you do have ADHD, I won't give you any Ritalin""","I'm terribly sorry you're dealing with this. His statements are rather ignorant of the reality of ADHD rates in adults. Child ADHD rates are nearly 1/10 - adult rates should reflect about the same, but currently only about 5% of adults are diagnosed with ADHD. The 10% child rate matches up nearly perfectly with the lifetime prevalence in adults of 9% ([https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd#:\~:text=Prevalence%20of%20ADHD%20Among%20Adults,-Based%20on%20diagnostic&text=The%20overall%20prevalence%20of%20current,all%20other%20race%2Fethnicity%20groups.)](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd#:~:text=Prevalence%20of%20ADHD%20Among%20Adults,-Based%20on%20diagnostic&text=The%20overall%20prevalence%20of%20current,all%20other%20race%2Fethnicity%20groups.))

This means that he should be seeing a good amount of ADHD patients - a large portion of his patients are likely ADHD whether he's diagnosed them as such or not, but ADHD like many other mental disorders is a spectrum. There may be individuals who he treats that have ADHD that may not need or want treatment for it, but ADHD has massive comorbidities with anxiety, depression, and ASD.

When I went to my psych I wanted to specifically try stimulants as a first treatment method. I specifically told her: ""I know stimulants have an inverse reaction in individuals with ADHD. If they make me more energetic, hyperactive, or anything of the sort then it's clear we're going down the wrong path, but if they make me calmer and more focused then we know that we've got the diagnosis right"". The latter occurred - my partner indicated I was far less manic on ADHD meds and we've stuck with that treatment since.

I know you didn't ask for advice, but I have some that I hope might help. You're going to have to bridge the gap with him in some way or find another doctor - those are your only two options.

I would take the approach with your doctor of ''Hey, I get that you feel that this isn't a proper diagnosis. My concern is research has consistently been showing it to be more and more common than we initially thought in adults. If you're not comfortable starting out with stimulants because they're a scheduled substance I get that - it's your medical license. Can we at least try something like Strattera and see what effects we have? This may not seem like a big deal to you, but this has been something I've struggled with for years. I'm more than happy to submit to any tests you want or steps you need to have taken. My concern is every existing research study shows untreated ADHD results in significantly higher occurrences of anxiety, depression, and overall unhappiness with life due to the resulting inability to be ones best self. This means that my prior depressive and anxiety based episodes could have been a comorbidity and I want to treat the root cause and be the best person I can - not just put a bandaid on things that isn't going to be as effective long term.''

If that fails - I've found online ADHD psychiatrists to be very understanding and effective. There are many options in that regard that may even be more convenient for you then seeing this specific doctor. I think a large part of that is individuals who work in telemedicine are likely early adopters of technology and keep up to date with ongoing changes and research."
"""Even if you do have ADHD, I won't give you any Ritalin""","If you have decided what you want and he has clearly stated he will not do that why would you go back?  If I was him I wouldn't see you again.  
Typically a good evaluation is at least 3 Vanderbilt questionnaires one of them you, an mmpi, and achievement test, an IQ test, a Connie's continuous performance test, possibly a bender-ghestalt test, neurological screening test, chem 20, liver function and sassi.  This should take about 16 to 20 hours.  I got a flyer from evergreen a few days ago about an ADHD certification they give for clinicians, they may have some updated advice as I have not done this in a while."
"""Even if you do have ADHD, I won't give you any Ritalin""","Mom is definitely right - please don't go back. Your appointments with your psych are supposed to be your safe space - not where you get ridiculed and experience gaslighting. Is it possible for your to find a private psych? I know they are expensive, but you could find one where the prices are less, and they may be able to work with your insurance as an ""out of network"" provider.

Another option is to go to a psychologist versus a psychiatrist. I don't know the regulations in your area, but I was able to find a private psychologist to diagnose me for a VERY reasonable price and my GP is the one who manages my medication (she just requested that I get a diagnosis first). I am in continuing therapy with my psychologist still and I very much enjoy every appointment with her and even look forward to them. This is the relationship you should have with yours - you should be able to trust them with every ounce of your being. I know it's hard, and it will take time, possibly a lot of money, but it is so worth it so feel understood and validated. In the meantime, you can certainly put yourself on the waitlist for the ADHD clinic just in case your search for something else comes up short. 

I'm so sorry this happened to you and I really hope you find someone else that will actually do their job!!"
"""Even if you do have ADHD, I won't give you any Ritalin""","Don’t walk , run. You did the right thing. A doctor that is that condescending to you is a huge red flag. I’d gently suggest that you consider reporting him. He’s clearly biased against ADHD. I’ve had mine since I remember. It does not, for many people, go away. And young women are woefully misdiagnosed.

We fall through the cracks because usually, girls are socialized to swallow down and suppress any behavior that irks others or doesn’t fit the mold of being ‘feminine’ . Rarely does anyone give a damn how it’s actually affecting the person suffering.

I was lucky to get a therapist who has ADHD and can empathize with me. And though I hate to say it, I’m sure there are wonderful men therapists, but I’ve had greater luck with women physicians and doctors. Many men are still very dismissive of women."
"""Even if you do have ADHD, I won't give you any Ritalin""","I have no idea why you would stay a minute more after ""he got pissed.""

Your doctors are professionals providing a paid service; if they cross the line and get mad at you in the manner described here and then stand their ground, they are demonstrating a clear misunderstanding of their role in the relationship, and you just need to leave.

It's not cowardly or shameful to just walk when people you're paying do something like this; they are simply not worth your time, and you have their bill to back up your value assessment.

Make your appointment at that clinic now, and then keep looking for a better doctor in the meantime. At least you'll have a real time frame for getting the help you want (though 15 months does hurt), and maybe you can get bumped up on their schedule if spots open on their end.

Also, see if there are any psychiatrists in your state who offer video appointments. Covid really opened things up on that front.

This guy sounds like he's, frankly, a piece of shit *and* a shit doctor, and I'm sorry that was the best option you had available at the time."
"""Even if you do have ADHD, I won't give you any Ritalin""","You are probably wasting your time with him if he has concluded that you are just depressed.

You drove 2 hours round trip to see him. There aren't any other psychiatrists within that area without long wait times?

In the end you may not have adhd but you owe it to yourself to get comprehensive testing, not just answer 18 questions. I would try to find a place to get tested. Do some legwork and talk to your primary care about a referral.

I wonder if the psychiatrist would prescribe a non stimulant like Strattera. He may just be opposed to stimulants. Or maybe your primary care would if they wouldn't prescribe a controlled substance."
"""Even if you do have ADHD, I won't give you any Ritalin""","I don't know exactly where you are based but I saw you mention Germany, Germany is like Ireland, where I am, in that only a Psychiatrist can diagnose AND prescribe ADHD meds, unfortunately GPs, psychologists and therapists cannot.

I looked up this list if it's any good to you? It's all the English speaking psychiatrists in the Berlin area, also includes what type of insurance they accept and what they specialize in. I can't help with the German one as I don't speak German unfortunately but hopefully you can find someone from this list.

"""Even if you do have ADHD, I won't give you any Ritalin""",You definitely should go to someone that specializes in adhd. When I went to get diagnosed I was really nervous after reading all the horror stories on here like your’s. I went to someone that specializes in adhd and my experience was not like this AT ALL. I actually felt way better even after my first appointment before I get tested. The psychologist told me straight up “just because you did well in school doesn’t mean you don’t have adhd”. It felt nice to hear that and it came from a professional’s mouth. If you go back to him you’ll probably just waste your time and money unfortunately. 15 months sounds like a long time and it will probably feel even longer. I had to wait 6 months to get my appointment. But it really would be way more worth it to wait that amount of time than go back to him because it sounds like he isn’t interested in actually helping you. If you do get in with the place that has a 15 month wait there is a good chance you’ll get in earlier than that because usually when people cancel or something they will move everyone else up on the list. Good luck! I hope you’re able to get help.

It helps but it was not for me I got really angry coming down off of them (easily triggered) at the end of the day and I’m not really that kind of guy.

That Dr sounds absolutely infuriating! And nothing there sounds excusable... However, they may have simply said they wouldn't give you Ritalin as a sort of screener to ward off drug seekers. It might... MIGHT be worth going back but probably not. I didn't. 

So I thought I might have ADHD or maybe Autism so I went to see a psychotherapist who specialises in both for diagnosis.

1st appointment she spent a good minute telling me how she didn't believe in drugs and how they only make things worse and destroy lives. Simply put she would not be prescribing me ANYTHING. Ok fine I just want at diagnosis  please. 

3rd appointment my diagnosis is super inconclusive and she wanted to referral me to a specialist AND PUT ME ON DRUGS. I mean what the hell?!? That's right, with an inconclusive diagnosis she was wanting me to test some ""life ruining drugs that she would never prescribe"". It must have been a screening comment for drug seekers. 

Anyway. I didn't go back because that little inconsistency was the least of my uncomfortableness with her and I don't want drugs thrown at me like spaghetti on a wall to see what sticks! I have a family that depend on me. They are half the reason I'm reaching out for help in the first place.

"""Even if you do have ADHD, I won't give you any Ritalin""","> I feel like there is no choice other than to go back. I won't get an appointment with a normal psychiatrist for months. 

Okay but take a sec and really think about what these options actually are. Let's remove the bit where this asshole is ""technically a psychiatrist"" and talk in terms of symptom management:

1. You wait 15 months for a chance to get support and treatment for your symptoms
2. You get no support or treatment for your symptoms for the foreseeable future, plus you spend some amount of time regularly being told that your symptoms are fake

It sucks A LOT that there's no option 3 where you can get support and treatment sooner, but that's the reality, unfortunately. And, given that, I think it should be pretty obvious that option 1 is the best one available to you.

In the meantime, even if you don't have access to medical treatment for your symptoms, you may be able to get cognitive-behavioural treatment. These tools work a lot better *with* medication, but they can certainly be useful even without. Because psychologists and therapists are not medical doctors, it's often easier to find and get an appointment with one. They may not be able to help you get an official medical diagnosis or provide medication, but they can provide other symptom management tools (and they may be willing to provide support when you do speak to another psych in a year or so, to provide further context and confirmation of your symptoms).

Also, last bit of advice - ask your GP to test you for thyroid disorder and any other physical disorders that can cause ADHD-like symptoms. Thyroid disorder can cause issues that looks almost *identical* to ADHD. Many doctors will get this test as a matter of course while determining if ADHD is an appropriate diagnosis, but not always. It's a good idea to make sure you've looked into all the possible causes of your symptoms, but *also* it's a strong indication to future doctors that you are *not* drug-seeking; few drug-seekers would be interested in providing doctors with a possible alternative to providing them the drugs they want, right? Showing that you're open to alternative explanations for your symptoms (and being willing to undergo something inconvenient and unpleasant like a blood test as part of that) is a power reassurance to doctors who may be putting themselves at risk of serious repercussions if they end up prescribing heavily controlled medication (like Adderall) to a patient who turns out to be misleading them. Plus obviously if it turns out that you *do* have thyroid disorder, you'll obviously want to know!"

I'm a classic case of 'talks too much in class', 'very sensitive' and the favourite - 'a day dreamer'. 

I spent an hour with the doctor. Explained how I got to my conclusion that I believed ADHD-PI was likely in my case.

I also took a couple of tests that I found on the internet and the results. He had a copy of one that he asked me to fill out on the day also.

I was diagnosed at the end of the hour and started Ritalin the next week after blood tests and heart monitoring.

I definitely am very grateful that the Doctor listen to me and my concerns. My husband wasn't convinced and my mum never noticed my 'issues' apart from my diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder and General Anxiety Disorder with Suicidal Idealation at 11 years old.

Shame on that Dr. I hope that you receive the help you need and deserve. He truly needs to educate himself. Adult diagnosis of ADHD is more prevalent than he may think. 

Good luck!"

They emailed me a list and I found a place that did not even require a referral, just an intake interview, and they did extensive 5 hour testing.

I didn’t walk in with a medication in mind, and would have even been happy to try a non stimulating adhd medication had that been suggested first.

(Side story as to how I, a random American, was pretty certain it's the state doctors' chamber you want to make a report to: when I was studying in Germany, I broke my big toe and after being discharged with hospital x-rays I had to go for a follow-up outpatient appointment the next day to find out if I needed a boot. The doctor literally was like ""eh, I don't believe it's broken"" without even looking at the x-rays!?!

War dann 3 Tage später bei einer tagesklinik um die Möglichkeit eines Therapie Programms zu besprechen und hab von meiner Vermutung erzählt.

Werde dann ab April für 6 Wochen krank geschrieben sein und da dann jeden Tag hingehen. Hatte keine so tolle Kindheit und immer noch kein gutes Verhältnis zu meiner Familie.

Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"As you've said, your brain isn't ignoring it.

Focus on seeing the right side for a bit and it should even out. Also lower your chin - if you are fixating you're probly looking right down your nose and changing your head angle should help.

When you are not on the ritalin explore your field of view with one eye and the other (alternate one eye open) paying special attention to your nose - a baseline should help calm your mind next time it happens on the drugs."

Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"I love this question and I can answer it because I have this problem as well and I asked a optometrist once when he was giving lectures on peripheral vision. My question was similar - when I stay up really late at night studying, when my meds wear off, all of the sudden my peripherals start opening up. I get spooked by items moving in them. He said that it’s because of the adhd. My brain has taught itself to filter peripherals out but when I am that exhausted, it can no longer do that. So when you are on your ritalin your brain is noticing something that it usually doesn’t notice. Fascinating stuff. I suggest you tilt your head a little until the effect wears down and try not to focus on it."
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"It could be anxiety or it could be that for the first time you haven't been so ""outside of your body"" (hyperfocusing or daydreaming) that you have become aware of your ""self""."
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"It’s a stimulant, and sometimes those can trigger OCD for those of us with dual diagnoses.  That’s the immediate thought I had when I read this.  Normally your brain would just ignore stupid stimuli, yours hooked on to seeing your nose and now you can’t unsee it.  I’d talk with your MD about this.  Might need a different, non-stim med, or to medicate anxiety also.  I worked in mental health for many years, always talk to your doctor about weird side effects.  There are other options and it’s easy to just stick with the first thing you’re prescribed, but it can take tries w other meds before you get one that hits your specific spots."

If it bothers you lower your dose."
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,This happened to me when I started dexedrine. It went away after a while. I can't remember how long it took but I'm guessing 1 to 3 weeks.

When I started meds I could suddenly see the pores on my face skin. I thought I needed medical intervention! Decided I’d monitor it for further assessment - I forgot about it within a couple of weeks. Upside of adhd.

Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"Im on ritalin right now and I cant see my nose unless I focus on it.

Is your dose really high? Im on 20mg - 30mg spaced out through the morning and early afternoon."
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,Oh that’s where I put it!
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,what…?! I notice my nose but I’ve also noticed that my preferred side of vision is my right eye? Like I couldn’t see my nose from a left angle unless I close the right eye. this was uncalled for
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,Congrats
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"I started seeing my nose randomly with 17. I also started seeing my Eyebrows at the top of my vision field and my cheeks at the bottom. It didn't go away, but I got used to it.

Edit: I am 31 now."
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"The kind of meditation I've been doing since a decade, deconcentrarion of attention, makes one expand their focus, reducing attention strain, and not focus on anything, which means you're aware of more things, including the nose always being there. Methylphenidate has a meditative effect on me, calming my breathing, reducing tension and if it's doing the same to you, it just might be that you have less attention strain, more relaxed and observing what has always been there. Just my theory based on my own experience. Might be totally wrong."
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,I legit had this as a kid when I was on Ritalin.
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,Now I can't unsee it.. Need help!
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,My god what have you done…
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,OP i’m on Ritalin too. i have no idea what you’re talking about but i hope i forget about this before i take mine in the morning because i need to be able to go to school
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"i think you noticed it one day bc it's unusual to see / be aware of / notice your nose, and now you might be hyper-focused on it. different people hyper-focus on different things, but we all have something that seems like a huge deal to us and it's really not...  

i have a friend who said to me one day, ""man! i keep seeing my nose in front of my face and it's messing with me!""   (the reason i responded to this bc of that one day long ago...)

i thought it was so nuts and funny and then i noticed mine!  i still do. from time to time,

it comes and goes for me and it's odd but there's noting wrong with you. 

your meds are meant to help you focus... so your brain focused on your nose... i can say try shifting the focus to something else when you take your pills, however, anyone can tell you that. i wouldn't worry about it and eventually you'll forget about it.

for instance, i've had days and days in a row where i noticed mine... it was so uncomfortable.

and just now i tried to notice mine and my eyes won't let me. 

maybe it happens when our eyes are  tired or swollen slightly? who knows! i just had to say something bc it's funny as i had a funny experience with my friend and i still do see mine here and there...

take it easy!"
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"When I got my nose pierced I couldn't stop seeing it. The sun would shine on my nose and I'd see my stud sparkle. It was so trippy.

I hope your brain starts ignoring your nose again!"
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,👃🏻
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"I felt the same way when I first took Concerta!  
Not only my nose, but also the frames of my glasses didn't disappear for a while. ......"
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"I said this about starting Vyvanse. I could feel my toes. Not that they were numb before but I wasn't aware of them. On drugs I can integrate my awareness of my body into normal life.

It will settle down! You will be able tell your brain 'yes, that's my nose, it's not important, please keep your eyes on the road'."
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,God I can see my nose all the time. If I've got some dry skin it annoys the hell out of me.
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,Fucks sake you made me notice my own nose 😭
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,Amputation perhaps /j
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"What nightmare is this?! I mean, of course it's there, but now...it's *there*."
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"My guess is that it's the left side because your left eye is dominant, if you look to the left side do you see your right side of nose?

Also thank you for reminding me my nose exists now I can't stop seeing it haha (no offense thought, all the love)"
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,Oh no.. OH NOSE
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,Maybe it's because of more focus now ?
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"Honestly it’s just stimulant hyperawareness, this should become less pronounced overtime as you get used to the dose increase and build a tolerance.
I would recommend slightly lowering your dose if it’s too distracting."
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,OP… What have you done
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"Fuck you OP....

Edit: I gave you an upvote anyway btw because the comments are funny but still.. fuck you OP"
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,I.. it’s.. has it just always been there like that??? I might be having a crisis.
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"Would guess its some weird bit of your brain that have been functioning for you on ""lower"" speed, so you gotta ""retrain"" your brain to learn to ignore it while on meds 🤷‍♀️

I've been noticing my body differently when medicated- fx pain, hunger feels ""different"" so my not eyes? 
I do use my glasses more while meditated- but not sure if that is just because I remember it a bit better.."
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,I fucking see my nose now oh god
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"This happens to me sometimes, and if I just brush my nose away it works for some reason?"
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,Mate why did I read this. Can't even type without seeing a salmon pink potato in the corner of my sight...
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"I'm really glad my nose is small and not visible. I remember when I was younger though ""seeing"" it a lot."
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,Well the post is in ADHD corner of reddit. Many people will forget about there nose in like 5 minutes.
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,Omg I’ve never felt so much comfort from a Reddit post before. I started taking Strattera recently and I swear the first day I could feel my teeth lol. Like I never had a perception of them till now.
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,yea dude i just started taking ritalin and came here for advice but now I see my nose and I hate it
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"I’ve always been like this. I assumed regular-nosed people didn’t have their nose in line of site! It’s just one of the things my brain fixated on to have something to be anxious about. With meds such as ritalin, you focus on what’s directly in front of your face. Blank computer screen. Assignment. What have you. While the brain is searching for the thing to land it’s focus on, I think it can cognitively take a bit to find. So our eyes see our noses first and now our focus is unintentionally on the nose till it finds something more important. That’s my 2¢!"
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,Sounds like depersonalization
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"Why, I'm getting diahrrea...if I took my ritalin and still have it, was it absorbed?"
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"Can’t. Unsee. Nose…
Send help"
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,This is literally why Tourettes conventions are risky. Tics are contagious.
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,Now I can't ignore mine. Thanks OP.
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,aaarrrgggh...now I can't un-see it!
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,Haha sorry 😅
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,this comment made me lol
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"I have ALWAYS been able to see my nose all the time. It is not annoying to me because I am used to it. It appears kind of translucent. I do sometimes worry that it is some kind of medical problem, since I have never heard of someone noticing it all the time."
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,Can you see it from both eyes when the other is closed? I have only ever been able to see it from one of my eyes
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,DUDE. THE ONE EYE THING
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,Omg 😂😂
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,But are you also now aware of your tongue? Breathing manually? Blinking manually? :V
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"Cursed post, we are all doomed now."
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,Now I can't unsee my nose too
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"This reminds me of a man who infected me with a terrible cognitohazard that took over a year to go away…read at your own risk. Maybe it’s safe if you just read it rather than experience it.

>! I had to walk about the length of 2 blocks with this man. Normally your brain kinda automatically syncs up your walking pace with someone else, but his was not doing that and his pace was completely inscrutable. !<

>! I had to adjust and change almost every other step. It was so destabilizing to have to think about and be aware of. It broke my brain and then the next person I had to walk with I was thinking about my steps still. !< 

>! It persisted and got worse for a bit, and I was like 25% as bad as that dude was with affecting other people’s pace adjustment when my own manual adjustment wasn’t perfect. Eventually I got better at manually managing it and then it became easy, then second nature again finally. !<

Genuinely a fucking nightmare though!"
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,And like the left side specifically… why can’t my eyes focus on the other one WHY ISNT IT EVEN
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,https://c.tenor.com/lwyFmkSLNqwAAAAM/cat-cats.gif
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,Whats wrong with Ritalin? because i recently started....pls respond me
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,Vyvanse gang
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,[deleted]
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,I feel the tongue thing every single night-
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,Uggghhh I hate when my tongue won’t get comfortable because it knows I’m watching it!!!
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"Do you also get really aware of your mouth in general and it kinda tingles a bit?

Because I had it with my legs first, and then I’d have a panic attack (out of nowhere because I’d just watch tv or something, no trigger). And now recently my mouth starts feeling weird (the inside) I can’t really explain it but it also feels like the precursor to a panic attack out of nowhere."
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"Oh god, this right here. I noticed myself clenching HARD the other day while working. Not sure why, but apparently that’s what I do when I take my meds. It kills me"
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"I started Concerta recently and use Ritalin on days i don’t want the whole day thing effect, and can confirm that tongue thing is hell. I even had more than one inflamed taste bud and a canker sore all located in the area around the tip of the tongue. Canker sore was right under the tip (wtf). And it all began happening when i started with those meds i mentioned. The pain is close to unbearable. So i started to be mindful of everything and noticed how much i was rubbing my tongue with my front teeth while in “productive mode” on the meds.

I guess this is where one weighs the benefits vs side effects. Still haven’t been long enough on then to really tell, but I guess this is also when I can practice some good ‘ol mindfulness (hopefully)."
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"Well, this is going get some hate, but look up blocked throat chakra. I was doing my PhD in cellular and molecular medicine. Very much a type A person with no patience for pseudo science. But as I've become more open to different types lines of evidence I've realized there is a lot western culture has completely written off without giving it a chance. Mediation and mindfulness are thousands of years old and science is just now realizing they might be good for you. I bring this up because your symptoms very much align with the description for a blocked throat chakra. Very much what I have been feeling for a while and just recently realized

The supposed cause for this is not probably expressing emotions, which is common in ADHD. Random tip, shame is very potent in suppressing emotions you don't want to feel. Anyway, me trying to align this with peer-reviewed knowledge.. I think when the Ego tries to supress emotion, it's still there. It's subconscious. So the subconscious is like priming all the muscles involved in talking, but nothing happens and it just builds up a lot of tension. I'll probably get a lot of hate for pseudoscience, but you learn how to assess evidence well during a PhD and I know what I know and realize some people can be convinced of a lot of stuff. Anyways, I hope that gets better for you"
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,I can relate to feeling tension in my shoulders when I'm stressed. I've held in tension for about 10-15 years and I've only started letting go of it recently. it's been incredibly exhausting.
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,OH IS THAT WHY MY BATHROOM BULBS FLICKER?
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,Bro does Ritalin increase fps?
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,Yes and flickerings in TV or image errors from streaming or compressing.
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"Great now i see my nose, beard AND cant breathe"
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,Dude yeah… like 100%
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,It feels so scary to me when I randomly feel pulse in my eyelids for example. Am I going to explode??
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,What you censored is my life every second of every day. Add onto it >!I can feel my lungs full and draining with air. It feels like how a strong gust of wind through bare tree branches sounds!<
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,Oh God...
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"I feel what I describe as energy stimulating my nerves to create the feeling of touching something that isnt there, mostly when i have caffeine"
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"I can grok Linux logs as they scroll by like matrix style... I was doing that before I got on Vyvanse though. ..

Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,[Take a closer look at that snout!](https://youtu.be/Dc6pAuRiyVo)
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,Totally I have ocd and adhd and non-stimulant adhd meds are much better for me
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"Right? This is blowing my mind that other ADHD'ers aren't always seeing their noses. One of the symptoms of ADHD is being unable to tune out irrelevant stimuli, and these people are all here tuning out irrelevant stimuli like nobody's business. Also weird that ADHD meds would suddenly make them present like an ADHD person. It's like the Twilight Zone over here. 

And then like all these people talking about suddenly being able to see their glasses, and smell the inside of their nose, and feel their heartbeat in their eyes, and I'm like bro, these things aren't normal!? I'm 40 for Pete's sake, and I've been that way my whole life!"
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,[deleted]
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,But can you see the rims of your glasses?  When I am wearing my glasses and not my contacts I can see the rims of my glasses.
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,[deleted]
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"I shouldn’t have laughed, but I did. Sorry."
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,Oh there's this lovely girl on YouTube with tourettes and she's got a couple of friends that have it as well. She's really open about it and her videos are hysterical
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"(mention a tic) legit me ay, I have a tic that I look at my nose (both sides) I picked that up from someone else on r/tourettes"
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"This totally sounds like a joke, yet I know it's true"
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,I think the scientific name for your medical problem is Biggus Snozz Syndrome…I have it too lmao. I think it’s more worrying if you can’t see your nose though because that means that you’ve somehow lost it
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"Everyone can see their nose if they pay attention to it, not being to ignore it is the weird part. It's like how you breathe automatically right up until I just mentioned it, and now you have to consciously decide to in/exhale. The breathing thing will become automatic again as soon as you're not thinking about it, and usually ignoring your nose does too."
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"Don't worry, that translucent part is completely normal. I'ts the result of the fields of vision from both your eyes overlapping. Your brain pieces together your view from the combined images of both eyes so when you look left for example, it will only get the image of your nose from your right eye. It then appears translucent due to your brain combining one image with nose and one image without. It will no longer be translucent when you close one eye but then you will also only see your nose on one side."
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"I can actually see it on will - and then ""unsee it"" - like you say, its translucent!

Ita like an invisible shadow that do not block my vision per see, but it is there.
And if I want to see it, i can make it appear more?"
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,Asymmetry yay
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,I can't believe you've done this
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,Fucking noses
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"Who nose, this might snot be a bad thing"
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,[this self perspective self portrait comes to mind](https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ernst_Mach_Innenperspektive.png)
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,Same lol
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,And now you breath manually
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,TIL I learned a new word: cognitohazard
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,Well . Now I have this sudden urge to walk without rhythm ... Which will fail to attract the worm. Apparently that worm carries a metronome and keeps ppl from paying too much mind to how ppl walk.
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,too bad you couldnt get treatment with amnestics
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"I think they meant ""I don't take ritalin"", rather than instructing people to not take ritalin. Either way, meds are different for everyone so trust your doctor and your own experience, not redditors"
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"Speak to your prescribing doctor, and don't take advice from internet strangers."
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,When I first went on Vyvanse I was so focused and overwhelmed at work that I didn't realize I was clenching my teeth until I got home and noticed my teeth and gums hurting. It was a very hectic day to be fair.
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"OMG I have this tongue thing too, just started a couple off months ago - can't believe this. It's so accurate, I'm just wondering if I accidentally posted this a couple of hours ago, without remembering it."
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,The worst is waking up in the middle of the night and not being able to fall back asleep cause you accidently think about it... Its insanely annoying
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"I always notice them in the corner of my eye, but in my luteal phase or when I'm really really exhausted it becomes unbearable. My brain just can't shut it out then. The first few weeks with MPH were very similar."
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,Right?? I kept seeing this and thought I was losing it haha. TIL
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,I don't take meds and mine flicker too.  Almost all the lights.  It's annoying.
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"I see compression errors in my own vision all the time, without medication."
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"It's particularly bad when you either do activity or strain your eyes. To me, it makes me wonder if >!the blood will pop my pupil off on the floor like ill-fitted contacts and leave holes in my eyes!<"
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"I can feel my lungs that way too, but it feels more like a balloon inside me. Though, when it's cold air..."
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,I feel like I can flex my nerves and give myself a tingly feeling.
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"Thank you for blessing my life with this video, oh my goodness"
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,I do see what you mean with the nose thing. I remember sitting in class and I just notice my nose and I can't unsee it. I would just silently deal with the frustration lol. That's when I wore contacts.
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"Goddamn it, now I can't unsee the rims now, and when I take my glasses off, I can't unsee my nose."
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,Ch-ch-chopper dyes his pubes ginger!
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,You… how dare you make me breathe manually
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,Automatic breathing is one of the worst feelings. It feels so stupid to have to focus on such a mundane activity but it also forces you to face mortality.
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,Why? Becoming aware of your breathing and body is literally a meditation excercise. I'm glad he reminded me.
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,Man I just saw this for the first time yesterday and I was excited to post it here.. wild
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"We can see our brow ridge?! I feel like this is something that I noticed as a kid, too, just that I stopped exploring my field of vision as I got older?? Because the experience doesn't feel *that* alien, in spite of my surprise. I can only see it if I crank my eyes *way* up, though."
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,Damnit!
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,Now you breathe manually
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"It’s actually terminology from the SCP universe, but I’ve found it to be so useful that I’ve made it a part of my regular vocabulary! It’s pretty self explanatory, especially when given with context like the above anecdote! I hope it becomes a commonly used term."
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,Honestly though!
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,Or with a grain of salt so to speak.
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"Fyi, you can get mouth guards from your dentist maybe. At least I got one for sleeping. And while I absolutely hate wearing it, I can't lie that it helps protect my teeth from grinding damage and my neck/jaw/head from tension when I do. May be worth checking out if you suffer from this more regularly."
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,It didn’t start being super noticeable until meds for me!
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,What kind of tongue thing? I play with my tongue in my mouth sometimes
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"I catch myself biting my tongue as I’m falling asleep, it’s so bizarre"
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"This makes sense, I notice everything more just before my period"
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,I ended up relaxing all of the bulbs because I thought they were dying lol
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"I feel like, with meds I notice it way more often. That much, that I sometimes think my eyes have a problem. Then I'm afraid this *blurryness* is a side-effect, but it's actually only compresssion errors."
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"Hey, at least it can't happen with your heart"
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,you're unconsciously trying to stop it from choking you in your sleep by trimming it bit by bit
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"I was hoping I wasn't the only one! I have some pretty severe other symptoms before my period as well, so I'm actually trying to get assessed for PMDD."
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,i dont even wanna think abt that one lol
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"LOL ""Just trim it!"""
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,I mean… fair lol
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"Yup, every sense is like, on fire! My PMS is so bad I considered PMDD as well"
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"As someone who thought I had PMDD before I got diagnosed with ADHD (at 32), I must say that it could also be PME.
“Premenstrual Exacerbation (PME) refers to the premenstrual exacerbation/worsening of the symptoms of another disorder, such as major depressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder. 
Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) and Premenstrual Exacerbation (PME) are difficult to distinguish from each other.“

At the same time, there does seem to be a connection between ADHD and PMDD/or intensification of PMS symptoms compared to people who don’t have ADHD. There are a couple of journal articles on it available online.

Either way, what I want to get at is for the longest time I thought I had PMDD and was put on antidepressants for it. Although there was some relief, it wasn’t addressing the biggest motor of my symptoms: ADHD.

So yeah, it’s something worth looking into, i think. Hope all y’all find some relief for all the premenstrual woes! Cause the struggle is real af!"
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,What is PMDD?
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"Might be worth addressing with a doc, then :)"
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"Beyond natural feminine considerations, I’d offer a possible alternative explanation:

- overstimulation of the nervous system has been a constant struggle in my life. I honestly didn’t even know that was a thing until my late 30’s, after being diagnosed with ADHD. Empirical research and loads of anecdotal observations have led me to conclude that this is incredibly common for severe cases of ADHD. 
- an overstimulated nervous system is *the* recipe for disaster as our body struggles to find grounding, a continuous pattern of fight or flight response mechanisms. 

I’ve gotten to the point where, when I’ve realized my system is receiving too much sensory information, I simply must shut it down. Something as simple as a book falling off the shelf can have cataclysmic and reverberating aftereffects. 

Knowing yourself is half the battle. Responding to the subtle queues and providing ourselves with a good reprieve is what wins the war. Easier said than done, no doubt."
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"Oh yeah, PME is an issue, too! I definitely have PME of ADHD and of ASD/sensory issues. But I think I also have PMDD, because I have some symptoms that really only ever occur in response to my hormones. Mainly depression/suicidal ideation, social anxiety, anger, and uncontrollable eating binges."
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"Premenstual dysmorphia disorder, it’s like PMS, but like extreme

edit: premenstual dysphoric disorder not dysmorphia"
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"Yup, I’ve learned that when I start getting very very irritated, I have to go decompress and wind down"
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"Look, I'm sorry, but are you suggesting that my luteal phase is hell for me because I get overstimulated in my follicular phase, and that hormones don't play a role in this?"
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,"Dysphoric, not dysmorphia. 

Dysmorphia would be funny though. Imagine you just changed shape and morphed into a big, bloated, depressed cry baby who... Oh wait."
Took Ritalin and.. I see my nose?,I mean…. Close enough 💀 but yeah that’s what I meant LOL

They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"Interesting, they say ritalin should show up in a urine test for 1-3 days following use, so if you're taking it twice a day like I am you should be good (if these numbers are true).

They do say that drinking a lot of water can affect the drug metabolism.  Age is also a factor, so if you are young and have a generally fast metabolism it might get out of your system faster.  Also, heavier people eliminate it faster than lighter people.

Maybe your hail mary play here would be to ask to be given ritalin under supervision, and still have them test you the same way.  That way you could demonstrate that your metabolism is just super fast if you fail the tests when they know you took the pills."
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,Where do they make people do urine tests for adhd meds?!
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"I had this happen with adderall and Vyvanse! 

Since I have a documented history of burning through anesthesia during procedures my doctor increased my dosage and suggested I take it less than an hour before my next urine test. I ended up having be prescribed 20mg of Adderall IR and I split it into 10s and just took the full 20 when I went to check ups 🙃 It’s obnoxious but there’s usually some insurance/administrative restriction your doctor has to abide by even if they believe you’re taking it otherwise."
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,I'm prescribed Adderall and tend to sweat more than the average person. I also drink a lot of water to compensate for this. I have taken 2 drug tests in the last year (first as a new hire and the other for a car accident in a company vehicle) and did not test positive for amphetamines (or anything else for that matter). Sorry you are going through this!
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"If the negative tests are due to dilution via being a hydro homie, I'd imagine they are inconclusive and It could be easily argued/explained if ""they"" are willing to listen."
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"Are they testing for Amphetamine or Ritalin? Ritalin does not show up as Amphetamine and must be tested for specifically. 

Also, I once had a false negative during a routine screening at my doctor's office. It's common and the next step always is to send the sample to a lab, where the testing equipment is much more accurate than a dip stick pee test."
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"The VA makes me take a UA every year for my adderall. It’s really not that invasive. My stimulants never show up on the test, but I have tested positive for all kinds of random drugs that I don’t even do. I have no idea why the results come back the way that they do. Only thing I can think of is that they’re mixing up samples. Luckily I have a good rapport with my doctor, so we just kind of ignore the results of the test."

They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"I had this happen to me. I’m a chemist so I was able to really dig in and research why this happens. A lot of times doctors office tests use the quick panel which tests for amphetamines. Methylphenidate (Ritalin) will often show up negative on an amphetamine test. 

My doctor has to divide my sample in 2 and send it to an outside lab for methylphenidate testing."
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"Massachusetts. No testing. I will refuse any attempt. My doctor prescribed my medication, my insurance is paying for it - less my copay. The End.

They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"I take Adderall and my drug test was negative for amphetamines. When they called to tell me I was negative, the nurse couldn’t understand my concern and said “negative is good.” She seemed to think the drug test was to get a job or something.
Fortunately it didn’t result in any action and I’ve heard a lot of people get false negatives.
Did you take it that day? For me I was fasting for other blood work so I took it right after the test when I could eat again but my previous dose would have been within 24 hours since I take it twice a day."

If its a faulty test or you did it on a friday and they dont test on weekends, even if there was a busy day for the lab that does the drug screens or the lab is far away.

You have some homework ahead of you, but in a short version, the test probably didn't even test for the right substance.  Ritalin doesn't show up as an amphetamine."
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"Idk your dosage but we’re on therapeutic doses, not recreational meaning we’re on low doses. Drinking a lot of water or just being on stims and trying to stay properly hydrated dilutes the metabolites of the drug in your urine so it’s likely you aren’t meeting the thresh hold of the test they’re using because you’re pissing clear. If they’re using a dipstick test then it’s most definitely the cause you’re not showing up hot. Im sorry you’r being punished because they’re stupidity."
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"Ask them what the limit of detection is for the test and the 99% confidence interval for the concentration of Ritalin in urine x hours after dosing for someone who takes 80mg per day.

They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"I have heard of doctors doing this and then using the entirely wrong test, then accusing their patients of a crime when the drug (of course) doesn’t show up on the test.

They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,Hey I’ve actually had this happen to me. My concerta didn’t show up on a urine test (and it had never sparked a positive drug test before that but I just always thought they weren’t testing for it) I had been on the meds for YEARS and my doc ended up calling me back in a few weeks later and said she did ultimately believe me and thought my body was just metabolizing it too fast or something? When I switched to vyvanse it has sparked the drug tests.
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"If you are so dilute that your urine is clear, then your metabolite count would be quite low. Potentially too low to meet the minimum cut off level. You need to cut back on the water (though not entirely), and request a laboratory test."

They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,Do have generic Ritalin? It’s possible you drink enough and your body is used to metabolizing it that it doesn’t show up. It could be a faulty test. My friends brother had to pee in a cup and they said he has PCP in his system or something weird. He was a recovery heroin addict and on Suboxone maintenance which was fine. It turned out Benadryl can give false positives. We were googling what would make it look like you had PCP in your system that was one possibility. I think they have him a blood test or a more thorough urine screening and it was PCP free. Tests can be wrong I would ask if they can check your blood or hair for Ritalin and make sure they are checking for that and not Adderall which is a different chemical make up.
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"How long after taking the ritalin are you doing the test? Is it IR or XR? I haven't had this issue because thankfully the ""we can randomly drug test you"" thing has only ever been a threat and never enforced on me with my doctors, but I do know people can metabolize things differently and it's plausible for a number of reasons that this wouldn't showing up.

Some tests just need a higher amount in your system to detect, too."
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,This seems to be a major issue and people are thinking that the short age might have caused pharmacies to do funky stuff… there’s actually a group of people wanting to sue. I too take adderall and it never shows up on drug tests anymore.. it used to tho……
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"Who would want to sell or buy Ritalin? It's not as addicting or euphoric as the amphetamines like Adderall. Makes absolutely no sense to me. And just because it doesn't show up in your urine doesn't mean you're selling it. What if you forget to take it before you took that test? What if your body doesn't eliminate it in the same way as expected, like you metabolize it so quickly that it's not going to show up in your urine when you're tested. There's so many variables here and so much so wrong with this punitive and restrictive way of treating you.

You must be in your late teens or twenties. What state are you in and what kind of physician is doing this? Do they do this with people who get prescribed painkillers like opiates? I doubt it and if they do it seems more justified. That is such bad treatment."

They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,Have you tried a non-stimulant medication? I take Strattera and I know it doesn't work for everyone but it works for me and I love not having to deal with the controlled substance bullshit.
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"I take vyvance and it does not show up in urine tests. When I asked this is what I was told,

“The urine toxicology that was ordered for you is very generic in the subtypes of amphetamine salts that are being tested for. If we ordered the more specific panel, it is more likely that the lisdexamfetamine would show. There is a 12 panel test that includes a greater range of substances. Hope this helps!”

They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"Caution: long comment. I hope the bot doesn't bump this comment. 

 I know many people whose doctors make them drug test and will not prescribe if the medication is not detected in a urine test.  Doctors are extremely cautious here, especially if they practice in a state like New York where paper scripts are illegal and they are not allowed to send controlled or scheduled drugs (narcotics and stimulants) with refills.  

All scripts are processed electronically, and the scheduled or controlled drug prescriptions get sent through a big brother type of interface before they get to the pharmacy.  

That interface sends their DEA number along with the patient's prescription and dosing information to the DEA, and it gets dumped into a database that tracks our med usage. They WILL stomp on any doctor they believe is abusing the ""privilege"" of writing prescriptions for scheduled or controlled drugs. 

I think there are a lot of states that are similar, and this is why doctors don't hesitate to yank a patient off their meds if that med isn't found in a urine or blood test. 

THE INFORMATION BELOW IS FROM MY NEUROPSYCHIATRIST. I AM NOT A DOCTOR AND DON'T PLAY ONE ON REDDIT. THESE ARE SCENARIOS AND NOT TO BE SEEN AS UNREFUTABLE. 

As far as ritalin and urine tests go, each patient's elimination time will be different. If you have a large body mass, it can be eliminated in under 24 hours.

 It's the same if you drink a ton of water. Ritalin is water soluble, so a lot of exercise and a lot of hydration may cause it to leave your body quickly through sweat and urine. 

If you have a high metabolism, ritalin can be excreted from your body in less than a day.  The same goes for hypothyroidism. 

That means it may or may not show up on a urine test depending on your appointment time and when you last took your meds. 

Taking 1000 mg or more  of vitamin C daily can also speed up the excretion of Ritalin. 

The converse is true if you don't hydrate well,  have a low body mass, or have a sluggish metabolism.  It will also leave your body more slowly if you eat a high fat diet. 

Ritalin is rarely detectable in a blood test, which is why blood tests are rarely used. 

I don't understand why doctors rely on the unreliability of urine tests for Ritalin.  A hair test is extremely reliable.  Ritalin stays in the hair for around 30 days. Ask your doctor why they aren't testing that way. 

My doctor told me that he only used hair testing if he felt a need to drug test for someone who might be abusing their medication."

They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"I'm I Wi and would have had to take monthly tests for my Vyvanse if I hadn't had immediate problems with it. I refuse to be tested so I guess it's non stimulant meds for me...  (not that they've forced me to be on non stimulants, I just don't want to take the tests on principle... it's stupid).
I don't know if it's related to the uptick in diagnoses that regulators think we're all out here claiming adhd for meds to sell or what... 
And maybe OP, you're having problems due to the shortages. Some people have reported that they've come up negative for stimulants in drug tests and are suspecting that there's a lower ammount of active ingredient."

They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"My doctor had me sign an agreement that they can drug test me if they suspect I am selling my medication, in order to get future scrips.

They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"I was diagnosed in a teaching hospital département dedicated to addictions (both substance and non-substance abuse) they have one of the highest rate of adhd diagnosis in France, they do urine test because of black market resellers, I often came up positive with other drugs than one prescribed. No slap on the wrist, no blaming and no taking off meds. They are technically voluntary as they ask you if you want to do it if not they can remove  your treatment,"

They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"I’ve heard on this sub stories of doctors knowingly testing for amphetamines but acting shocked and dismayed when ritalin doesn’t show up.

They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,Are they testing for the right medications and are the tests sent to a lab? They could mix things up it also could be because you drink water and pee when you wake up.

They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,I think it's more about the doctors protecting themselves from scrutiny.  I don't think doctors really desire to hassle their patients.  The war on drugs (and the people selling them/abusing them) is to blame.

They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"There is a faction that is attempting to move away from stimulant medications because they don't understand ADHD.

They are just reading the results. 

Picture this, you are a fairly low paid stressed out technician in a rehab facility and one of the patients starts complaining about the test result confidence interval when he fails his drug test.  Most other patients are quietly complying.  

How would you react?"
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,Mk
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,I think my body metabolizes it really fast as well but had taken it around 5 hours before the first urine test
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,Hair is more reliable for Ritalin.  Blood tests are rarely used because they rarely can detect methylphenidate in the blood. Urine is the worst possible test for reliability.
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"This was my question.  Who on earth is selling ritalin.  It's not very strong, and it apparently takes a HUGE dose to get the feeling addicts look for. That info is from a recovering speed freak. No, it's not me. Lol."
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"My mom got into it with my doctor about this. I work night shift and have my mom on an ROI in case there's important correspondence I miss. My PCP prescribed me Adderall rather than my usual Ritalin on accident (the pharmacist had my prescription but I just assumed it was the shortage). I tried the Adderall for about 10 days to try and not seem difficult. I work in BH, so I am so aware about how workers in healthcare treat people they see as ""drug seeking.""

But I finally called and said I needed the Ritalin (and would turn in the Adderall) because I was having really bad side effects. And the office was very accusatory that me saying I wanted specifically Ritalin could be because I wanted to sell it. And my mom apparently asked them who is buying the meth without the amphetamine."
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,A hair test is more reliable.  Ritalin stays in the hair for 30 days. Docs  don't like to do blood tests for Ritalin because they rarely detect it.

Ritalin is metabolized to ritalinic acid mainly. So only one main metabolite.

I hope someone there wakes up to take you seriously"
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"Have them test the actual medication. There was a group of 60 different people who were supposed to report findings about this exact situation (negative testing/no active ingredients in ADHD and other medications) sometime last month. They were given cease and desist orders by the (iirc) drug manufacturers and threatened with law suits...no idea what's happening now. It was a huge list of medications they were testing, but I know every ADHD was on that list"
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,I've heard and read about people's experiences with Ritalin and drug tests. A lot of the explanations are that the facility or doctor is seeing that you have no amphetamines in your system. Ritalin is not an amphetamine so it would come back negative. Maybe the person who ordered your test/read your results fukd up?
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,May want to double check what their drug test screens for.   If it's just amphetamines then it won't catch methylphenidate
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,I’m in a rare group of people called ultra rapid metabolizers! I found this out through gene testing. It also made it make more sense why I get the weirdest side effects no one else gets from prescription drugs. You might be in that minority of people cause of your genes! Unfortunately I know you’re going to have an uphill battle proving that at rehab and I’m sorry this is happening to you!
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"Holy shit, 80mg? Did your dose gradually increase over time?"
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"Damn, sorry you're dealing with that. Nothing worse than being falsely accused of something, also being in rehab raises the level of suspicion  for the Techs/staff."
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,Did they test for amphetamine instead of methylphenidate? I've read about others with that exact problem and the idiots didn't test for the right substance.

They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"If it’s a tablet, have them crush it and put it in applesauce or something, they can’t say you’re trying to pocket them then. 
I’m sorry you’re having to deal with this and I hope a solution is found soon."
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,I'm guessing they actually want the more precise test in this situation.  You could theoretically still sell most of your meds if you only need to take them once or twice in a month.
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,That’s because it’s not an amphetamine. It’s a methylphenidate which is a completely different drug class. I suspect the people looking at OP’s urine don’t know the difference which is a bit concerning.
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"Not sure, just going off of what I've read.  Maybe more liver power?"

They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,Can they get you to take it in front of them and sit there for 30 minutes. Or in liquid form so you cant sneak it like a tablet
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"I'm pretty shocked you found a rehab that allows it at all. I'm not sure how severe your symptoms are but if you typically only need to be medicated for work/school related tasks, you should not need them at rehab. 

Also, some rehabs are not staffed by medical professionals. This might differ by state, but in VA you can have a rehab home that is not considered ""medical"". 

So, maybe there's a chance they think it would pop positive for ""amphetamine"" on a drug test that's only including crystal meth. Idk. If not then it's probably the water."
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"I used to too in AZ until I found another doctor. It’s not a state mandated thing, but some places do test regularly."

They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"Some doctors here make you sign a narcotics contract stating you are willing to take random drug tests as a condition before they will take you on as a patient and/or  prescribe anything.

It's alot of them, Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse....I know my meds don't feel like they are working like they used to, or AT ALL."

They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"Wow! That's crazy  Idk if I could honestly do that 😕  That feels super controlling, the pill count thing. I mean, I know I would be fine count wise, but I would feel like a 5 yr old who's in trouble. I would have constant anxiety about IF"

They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"No direct connection as far as I’m aware, but my doctor thought I may be metabolizing the adderall quickly even if I’m still feeling the mental effects.

They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"Liver function is the connection. Some people metabolize drugs faster than others. For example, I’ve been tested and found out that I’ve got a fucking beast of a liver. Which is why most meds wear off more quickly and I *also* tend to both get drunk and sober up fast."
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,Just the speed with which your body metabolized things

They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"So this is a bit of a story, but it all started back in February when I had an adverse reaction to OTC sleep aid. I don't remember the entire morning, leaving for work or interacting with anyone. They let me use heavy machinery on railroad equipment for 4 hours while I was slurring speech, visibly confused, and not okay. Eventually a coworker insisted I wasn't acting normal and management responded by taking me to an occupational health facility for a urinalysis. Again, still completely incoherent and do not remember any of this. The test results come back negative for my Ativan and Adderall, but positive for rule 4, which I have a medical card for (still doesn't protect me in PA though, which I knew beforehand). I was taken back to the work site and sent home for the day by being escorted to my vehicle and made to drive home. I started work at 5:30 so my wife had no idea what was going on until I luckily made it home and she immediately noticed I wasn't right. I ended up contacting my GP asking what would cause my prescriptions not to show up, at least for my own peace of mind, and after an in person visit he assured me he would look into it. Instead I find out when trying to refill my prescription that there was none, and when contacting the GP's office I was informed he was no longer able to refill or prescribe any controlled substance for me. This is the doctor I've seen for over a decade and this felt like a stab in the back. I still don't know what I'm going to do.

Edited to comply with rules"
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"Bipolar 1 with general anxiety and ADHD. I was already trying to lower my Ativan dosage but going cold turkey wasn't the plan, even though it was take as needed. The Adderall significantly helped with my intrusive/racing thoughts though so I'm sure that'll add to the problems with no more Ativan."

They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"I would say, ""you're right, the system is broken."""
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,I had taken mine a 3/4 hours before that test. But for like 2/3 weeks post failed pee test I was a MESS. I don’t know what actually changed my doctors mind but I feel like I could’ve ended up in a bad place bc of it

They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,So sorry you have to deal with this. I’m very interested to see where the issue is. Hopefully you just have a beast of a liver and/or very dilute urine. If they’ve known to look for the correct metabolite before it seems more likely they know the difference in the drugs. Hopefully.

So I learnt something new this morning. Interesting and good to know."
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,I hadn't heard about that! I knew that many generic stimulants don't work well. I've experienced that many times. Off to research the info in your comment. 🥰🥰
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,I heard that too but never heard what happened with it. I had tried to switch to vyvanse but it just made me exhausted and sleepy all day and someone suggested to test it. I never did but wondered
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,More info? Where'd you read this?
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,THIS THIS HOPE OP READ THIS!!
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,Ooh do you have any idea what gene this shows up on? I realised the other day that I could use the test I did to see my heritage to check if I absorb folates properly and wonder if I could tell this too as I definitely have my suspicions!
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"I was on 80mg Ritalin before being switched to Dexamphetamine - it just didn’t have nearly as much effect on me as it did on others (even my sister, exact same height and weight as me - maxed out at a 30mg dose of Ritalin). Drugs just do different things in different people I guess lol."
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,Yeah I thought general guidance was topping out at 60mg daily 🧐
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,Started with 40mg first week second week 80mg and are now waiting to get a second dose each day when it wears off in 4-5 hours
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,Could be a slow release formulation. 80 Mg over the course of a day isn’t unreasonable. It’ll also depend on whether or not it’s enantiopure and which acid salt it’s formulated as.
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,They should have used tests that detect methylphenidate but you never know

Thank you for clarifying for me.. the doctor that tried to do that to me tried to bill me for 3 unsuccessful drug tests.. I called corporate, spoke to someone that had half a clue.. and said if the provider did not know the difference in amphetamine and methylphenidate, I wonder if they are really qualified to be providing services"
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,Not true. Source: I live in WA. Could it be a county thing? Or maybe your doc requires it?
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,But that isn't exactly relevant to the question. You can answer this question without knowing the backstory.
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,I take it in front of them here and I have told them from the beginning that if they want to take a test they have to do it in the morning cause i drink so much water during the day
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"It’s often a case by case basis, but a number of residential facilities do allow controlled substances if prescribed, as long as they aren’t the DOA. But to respond to your comment about “you should not need them at rehab”; that’s false. Being in a Residential facility means that you’re engaging in group sessions, as well as doing “homework”, which can be working off workbooks, doing essay-like assignments, and doing deep reflections. Not only that, you have to engage in chores, and other duties around the facility.  It’s like being at school 24/7.  Many people with ADHD are at a higher risk of substance use due to neuro chemical deficiencies, so many red facilities WILL allow medications such as Ritalin or other stimulants, it just takes more attention and risk management on the facility’s part.

They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"Growing up I was always taught that I only needed my meds for school but, honestly, my life outside of school/now work is just as impacted by ADHD. A great example is when I’m cooking. I have almost started fires cooking while unmedicated because I will forget to turn the burner or the oven off.

To think about it from a rehab perspective, if there were specific tasks to complete like paperwork or chores then there is a 100% chance of unmedicated me not doing those tasks. Group therapy? I’d be too busy daydreaming. 

All that said, I’m now surprised to learn that there are rehab places that do not allow their patients to follow their maintenance medication therapy."

They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,NJ resident also. I was asked to take a drug test before I my formal diagnosis and getting meds but haven’t been asked since. My psychiatrist ordered a battery of tests before the diagnosis and to make sure my Adderall wouldn’t affect me in a negative way.
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,Here in the US there's at least like two states where it's mandatory to get drug tested to make sure you aren't selling. It's also interesting because I've heard from other people that getting ADHD medication in India is hell.
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,It is when you’re in drug rehab. Most places won’t allow amphetamines period.
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,Uk I've never been tested but your private doctor write to your nhs doctor so theyd know if you were going to 3.
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"Mine always came back negative if I took as prescribed. I had to double the dosage to get it to show on drug tests. I was randomly tested when I went in. Got in the habit of taking two every time I went in. Really sucked. 

The worst was asking questions around it, I’d ask “does it have anything to do with water intake after taking it, food, etc?” Dr would say nope, if you take it, it’ll show. But I literally take it every day. It was such an awful feeling every time."

They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"I just restarted Vyvanse (after pregnancy) and I have to go in to the doctor every month for now to renew my prescription. I had to agree to randomized pee tests. This week when I went to renew I had to take a test. 

I feel like my doctor implied the pee tests allow her to eventually write me a 3 month prescription? But I don’t know if it’s standard procedure. 

Previously when I first started meds I could have a phone call appointment monthly for refill but it was during COVID so they don’t do that anymore."
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"Same, and I'm in Utah. Out of the 20 or so yrs I've been on meds I've been tested once.

They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"Being a fast metabolizer is actually such a pain in the ass. Drugs (the legal and the fun kind lol) wear off so quickly and having to have higher dosages can mean having a higher chance of side effects, too. 

I’m also a very small person so doctors never expect it and start me out on *tiny* doses based on height and weight. I usually go through 3 dosing procedures before we get somewhere that works (below average because of my size, average when that doesn’t work, slightly above average when they really realize how fast of a metabolizer I am). I always know it’s not going to work, but I never say anything because I don’t want to seem like a drug seeker or something. I can’t tell you how much doctors have told me “dang, you really need a lot of “X-medication” for such a small girl. 

Like my liver could honestly chill a little bit. Some things *need* to stay in my system for a little bit lol. I’m only 27 though, so I hope it slows down with age."
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"Surprisingly, it's not just the liver, but the gastrointestinal tract as well. Only learnt this fact a few months back during the clinical pharmacology course i took, but the intestines express some of the same cytochrome enzymes as the liver, and in some people, the activity is so high, that they metabolise a big portion of the drug before it's even absorbed into the bloodstream. This is something that docs do take into account (or, well, they should). With some drugs, the range of how it's absorbed in different people is insane - i forget which drug group this was, but for some the bioavailability can differ from like 30 to 80% among separate people. In cases where the drug has a narrow therapeutic window sometimes pharmacogenetic testing is done to determine the safest and most effective doses for the patient.

When you add hepatic metabolism on top of the intestinal metabolism, which also varies a lot, one person can destroy the drug to almost nothing within first pass metabolism, while a different person might get significant dose dependent side effects from the same dose"

They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"I think 72mg of Concerta (2x36mg) is approved by the FDA, so 80mg of another methylphenidate product doesn't seem too unreasonable.

Sounds like they believe in magic, or think that OP has someone who will buy pills that have already been in someone's mouth, lol.  This seems like one of those situations where they are blindly following some protocol while using zero critical thinking skills or common sense.

Why would they even waste their time and resources testing someone who is taking meds under supervision?  Pure idiocy."
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,I’m surprised they would stop prescribing over it not being in urine. I get wanting to make sure it’s there or that people are taking it. Some doctors push to decrease doses or have patients that don’t take it all the time. I know younger kids sometimes just take it during school. I don’t know if they take their urine. My primary care doctor was the only doctor that ever had to do a urine test. He wasn’t a psychiatrist and it was a rule he had to follow. I had weed in my urine once  and I had to see a psychiatrist before he could prescribe again. My dumb ass smoked weed the day before my monthly appointment. He didn’t test every month. He was a really cool doctor. He was knowledgeable about medications and easy to talk to. He was a good doctor. Finding a good doctor can be so hard.
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"Depends where you are. In Canada, this would be unheard of. However, if its a rehab then it makes a lot more sense because of the higher risk of selling/overusing."
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,You could also be flushing it out of your system before it’s fully absorbed with the amount of water you are drinking.
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"If you’re drinking THAT much water during the day, you may want to slow up GRADUALLY and watch how it affects your body and your dosing.  Your medicine may work more like it does on the label."
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"I asked him what his tretment plan was for clarification. Many people do not take their meds for chores and household duties, that's why I asked him. He stated he does need his meds for normal functioning so it's null and void. 

As I state below, I may have been a bit biased with the facility I was in. I didn't find the assignments productive or helpful for a variety of reasons, so in my mind, I was not really thinking he'd need to put effort or thought into the assignments. Like I said I was so miserable there, everyone else there was miserable and barely functioning, I was just trying to give OP some calming tips in case he's panicking over it. 

I've lived in residential rehab facilities before, I was giving him advise and opinions based on my experience, I stated that some of them do not allow controlled substances and even pointed out it may be more common in non-medical rehabs."
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"Which unless the person being treated prefers only using meds in certain settings (which is true for some people) is a really strange mindset to take, because like you cannot get a diagnosis unless your symptoms show up in multiple settings. So deciding that only one setting is valuable enough for functionality is some grade a problematic bs and screwed up values. 

In my opinion."
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"Don't know why I got down voted, plenty of treatment plans involve only taking meds for work and school. 

In that case, possibly find a different center! Or try drinking less water, and make sure they are actually testing for ritalin and not a generic amphetamine.

And yeah I think it's pretty wildly insulting that a facility specializing in treating a *mental health disorder (substance use) will pretty much openly admit that they don't think cripling anxiety or ADHD are real diseases.* 

*This might be more common at non-medical facilities. For one, they are SUPER 12-step focused (I'm talking 6-7 meetings a day), and 12-step programs can be very religious and lean into the ""addiction doesn't need medical treatment it needs GOD."" mentality.* 

*So, maybe these facilities also don't think addiction is a real disease either. Who knows.* 

And as I previously stated, those facilities don't have medically trained staff, and are actually often staffed by recovered addicts. Controlled substances being stored on the premises would not be as secure as it would be at a facility with nursing staff."
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"I also live in AZ, I understand pain management for some people who need help controlling their pain medication doses but this seems insane to me!

They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"Yes, but I’m pretty sure that’s anywhere. I went every 3 months in person after I switched, but no drug test.

Edit: The pharmacy even served my meds 2 weeks early a few years ago because I spilled my Concerta on the deck at my parents and most of them slipped through the cracks and I was once served 3 months worth of meds because I was moving cities. None of that ever prompted the possibility of a drug test."
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"Weird.  Canadian here. I have been on Vyvanse for years and never had to do a pee test.

If you do get tested it's worth noting also that a blood test isn't always conclusive/accurate and to push for a biopsy of the small intestine and also that you need to be eating gluten in order for the test result to be accurate.

I had missed out on a lot of opportunities because I had been led to believe that meds are only a solution for school/work. A couple of examples: I won a contest in High School to visit a famous college for a writing retreat. Went and didn’t bring my meds because it wasn’t school and I really wasted that huge opportunity. (Think sleeping through group sessions and spending most of my time sitting around daydreaming rather than taking in creative writing tips.)

Thank goodness you switched.


There was one month this spring where I Never even got my main dose, the extended release capsule I take in the a.m., bc none of the handful of pharmacies in my rural area got any in for close to 2 months...

I was only able to fill the much smaller dose of instant release, so rather than using it as usual- only as needed for as a p.m. boost-  instead that entire, very difficilt month I had to rely on that tiny amount to start my day, and it only lasted 3-4 hrs total . Ug.🙄

 (such a tiny, ""booster"" dose of IR is only effective relief for me when used in conjunction with my a.m. extended release, bc the initial dose starts to achieve a lesser degree of relief about 4- 6 hrs in, depending on factors like my activity level & meals. When I dont take the booster dose, my ER dose wears off completely within 8-9 hrs... it's so gradual, that I can only tell by my ability to focus growing more and more difficult, whereas the symptons just from a tiny IR dose wearing off are impossible to ignore and really pretty shitty, even if the period of time is short)."

Anecdotally, urine test posts I've seen here have come from the US, but this is anecdotal and my sample size is small."
They took away my ritalin cause they could not detect it in my urine test,"I just saw a joke that America is one of the ghettos of the world, and I laughed, and then realized that that's not wrong in more ways than I'd like to admit"

Took my first dose of Ritalin today,Choose your projects wisely.
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,I was on Ritalin when I was a kid. It gave suicidal thoughts. Keep an eye out for the side effects.
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"Congratulations OP!

I know what you mean. I was just recently diagnosed 6 weeks ago at 50. The change the meds make. Wow.

Like --- just having \*ONE\* thought at a time??

After having done life on ""hard"" mode, now it's switched to easy!

Have a totally awesome life!"
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"Today is the first day of the rest of your life. I was diagnosed at 30, and I have been taking Ritalin ever since-I’m 47. When you get diagnosed later in life, don’t get caught up in “what if?”thoughts. Too often, I have found myself thinking had I been diagnosed in high school or even earlier, what my life would be like. Also, forgive the people around you, your parents and teachers all made the best decisions they could with the info they had. My dad felt a lot of guilt, I had to assure him he was a great dad and I couldn’t ask for a better dad."
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,That is awesome to hear but just keep in mind you might be in the honey moon phase. That euphoric feeling and head high will eventually go away as you build up tolerance. By that point it will just make you feel grounded you will consentrate more and will most likely help with your executive dysfunction.
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"I'm so happy for you! I felt the same way taking Ritalin LA for the first time last year, the shock of realizing how little you suffer through the tasks is amazing. I used to take the shorter duration medication as a kid, to go to school and to do homework. I believe it might have accentuated symptoms of my anxiety by making me sweat a lot, but other than that I was fine. 

Keeping an eye out for changes and if you're experiencing adverse effects is important! But please do enjoy your ""just getting up and doing things"" times! As we all should :)"
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"I went through titration the last three weeks. The first week i felt just a little more focussed, the second week (with a slightly higher dose) was so nice! Just like you, i just did the stuff, at work I did not swap over to reddit or to my phone like every 2 minutes, i was able to focus for like an hour or longer, i did nearly no mistakes, i had regular meals and did not forget to eat or drink. 

It just felt like cheating! However, when i further increased the dose the symptoms got actually worse. So please, while it feels good now, take the titration process serious and keep out for side-effects (Ritalin also increases your bloodpressure, can give you headaches etc.). 

I also just got diagnosed like 3 months agon."
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"If I can give you one golden tip: don’t take it every day. I’ve been taking it since I was 7 years old (25 now) and it always worked as you describe because I only took it a couple times a week and and I didn’t get tolerated to it. Once I went to university at 22 and I started taking it every day, something changed after a year or two. I used to be fine with 10 mg a day, now I take 60 mg, and like someone already commented on this post: it just doesn’t feel the same anymore.. Conclusion: let yourself raw dog a few days a week and/or during the weekends, and you’ll probably continue to do all your work on days you’re taking it. Take care!"
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"I remember the first time I took Ritalin, it was a weird peaceful feeling with only 10mg, I was able to do any tasks! I now take 80mg per day and it doesn’t feel the same anymore…"
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,Not to be a Debbie downer but enjoy it while it lasts
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"Ahhh, the initial europhia of starting stimulants. Enjoy it while it lasts.."
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,what's your dose like ?
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,Ritalin made me feel like a zombie. I didn’t like it. I feel like it zapped my entire personality.
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"Be careful to monitor your electronic communications at first! I can get a little megalomaniacal, arrogant and wordy in cover letters when I’m in that superwoman phase. Hard to read unmedicated.  

Happy for you but police yourself 😞"
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,I was the same age when I was diagnosed and put on Ritalin it was night and day afterwards. I was going back to school to finish my degree and I was actually able to concentrate on school even with all the other distractions in my life. I’ve never tried any other ADHD meds so I can’t  speak for them but recently I’ve had to switch to extended release and it’s been more effective.
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"so great to hear. i got diagnosed at 28,and ritalin has been good, not great, but good.

and staying in less distracting places also helps out a lot.

i wanna try amphetamines, but they aren't available in my country."
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"It's an amazing tablet, totally zaps my anxiety and busy brain away. Can't say it's given me anymore motivation than normal, but certainly eliminated a couple of issues. 

Word of advice OP. Obviously I don't know where you're from so everywhere may be different, but keep an eye on your blood pressure and make sure you try to maintain your weight. Drs are ridiculously strict with this medication in the UK, I've been told if I go under a certain weight in this first month of taking Ritalin I have to stop the medication! Again, I don't know where you are so maybe it's not as strict, but yeah! If it's working for you, just keep an eye on your health. Id hate for them to be like ""sorry but we can't give you this anymore"""
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,It gives me raging stiffys
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"You know be careful with that stuff, I built up a tolerance very fast...and decided to use it only occasionally...that was a week ago still feeling the withdrawal...but not everyone reacts the same to every drug"
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"I am diagnosed, but not medicated. Does it help you with choosing something you love and STICKING to it ? This is my BIGGEST Problem now with ADHD, that i get bored SUPER quickly.

For example, i play Wow, and i can’t choose a class, i switch classes like more than 6 times a day (seriously). I also want to learn MANY things ,, and i just learn a bit, feel bored, then switch to learning something else .. and back and forth. This is SUPER exhausting and frustrating.

Does Medication solve that ? Or is this part i have to do myself and just try to focus ?"
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"Love this for you.  Had a similar experience a few weeks ago.  It doesn't feel real to think ""this is how most people feel normally."" Like... Kind of unbelievable.  But hey, I'm happy!  Hope it continues to help both of us (my med is different but similar I'm sure)."
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"I took my first dose of Ritalin today too and I honestly feel nothing.. still procrastinating, not being able to focus and being chaotic as usual.. utterly dissapointed"
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,welcome to the club 😎
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,Welcome friend. I'm 37. Got my first script when I was 35. I feel like an absolute machine now with Ritalin. It's given me a superhero version of myself. I just wish I'd been diagnosed in primary/highschool. My ADD robbed me of a lot of potential. Making up for it now with kids/work/life in general. Has particularly helped with my social anxiety as I'm not so exhausted after draining social situations.
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,Isn't it great when you find the needs that work for you? I spent the summer messing with different meds and finally landed back on one recently and when my coworker asked me about how it was going I told him I finally felt like I was actually present in that moment.
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"Not trying to make light of your post, but the food part is surprising to me. 

I know Ritialin is a different drug to Adderall and Vyvanse (The 2 I have taken), but when I take medication, and get focused, I don’t eat. 

Interesting. 

And congrats OP. 

Good for you for fighting for so long.

It is not easy. 

Remember, you’re not a victim, you’re a survivor. 

That is incredible. "
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"Shits wild, you still don’t have to eat, be careful, I went from 220 to 195lbs in 3 months, your just not hungry till your really hungry,"
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"Be careful. 

I was prescribed Ritalin due to the adderall “shortage”. Worked great for 4 days. On the 5th day, it fucked me up. I was at work, and had to go sit down because I started feeling really faint and short of breath. Coworker walks by, does a double take, and asks if I’m ok. Apparently I was about as pale as one could get, sweating, and not looking well. Boss sent me home. Never experienced that with adderall."
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"That sounds wonderful! I was prescribed Ritalin recently, but am looking for a pharmacy that has it in stock. Hopefully it stays good for you. Your post gives me hope."
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,Every time I try ritalin I get shortness of breath...
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"Congratulations! I wish you all the best!

Today is day 4 of Ritalin/methylphenidate for me. 10mg once a day, in the morning. So far I don't feel much of any difference. I don't feel more focused or energetic, nor do I feel any side effects. Maybe it's a low dosage, or maybe it's just not the right medication for me. I have a two-week supply, so I'll see if it starts to kick in."
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,This was my experience recently as well. Finally diagnosed at 48 about three weeks ago. It’s like a switch was flipped or like someone uploaded the cheat codes to my life. I’m happy for you!
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,Getting centered is powerful. Continued success!
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"Been taking medikinet which is european ritalin for over 10 years now, got prescribed at 15 years old.

It really helped me at school, i started to understand the maths and actually love it! Even my teachers were surprised that i changed overnight"
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"happy for OP! but this is great advice. because once you start, you wont stop until its done and youve touched every layer of the task.

I am 30 and newly diagnosed too, they just upped my dosage to 40mg of Ritalin a day. After my first month on, I honestly don’t know how I managed to get a Master’s degree. How was I functioning all of this time? Don’t let those kind of thoughts in. You did great getting to this point, You’re getting treatment and it can only go up from here. But yes watch for your side effects. I also take Wellbutrin and I say that it’s really making a difference for me."
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"Sage wisdom.

My greatest achievement so far has been able to develop a strategy for determining if my runaway project idea has a chance of reaching completion.

Being able to dodge half projects has been huge"
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"Toooo real. I take my first ritalin dose like 2 hours into my work day, and if i so much as look at my phone for about 20 mins after taking it, my next 4ish hours are screwed. Of course, if it kicks in while I'm doing work things, my phone (and the rest of the universe for that matter) might as well cease to exist for the next 4 hours lol"
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,Sorry to hear you went through that. I'll keep a close eye on things for sure though
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,OMG it gave me rage. I didn’t realize it until I argued with someone at work and I dont usually do that
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"Wow me too, that’s why my parents finally listened and pulled me off of it. After that I assumed my whole ADD diagnosis was incorrect and deidentified with it. It wasn’t until 36 that I realized the diagnosis was correct all along, just the drug didn’t work. 

Am on vyvanse now and having a similar experience to OP. Ritalin is said to work completely differently for adults but I told the psych I still don’t want to touch it with a 10ft pole."
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,I swear to god!! Same
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"Same with concerta but only on my period. Not only it didn't work during these days, it made them 100 times worse."
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"Makes me feel optimistic hearing that. I don't blame my parents at all. They are super supportive and loving, they just never thought to get it checked when I was a kid"
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"It can also happen that you feel like the meds don't have any effect anymore. They likely still do, it's just that you've gotten used to the effects."
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,I think I got Raynaud's from Ritalin LA 50mg
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"This is a Ritalin issue from what I remember. I'm on Vyvanse and my Dr specifically said to take it everyday. My previous doctor only prescribed 5 days a week saying I would become dependent...yes,dependent on functioning!"
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,[deleted]
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,This is why I only take it a few times a week
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,10mg to 80mg! In the span of how many years?
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"Jesus, did you chase the dragon or did it just stop working outright?"
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,This.. Couldn’t relate more!
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,Whats ur dose throught out the day
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,2 10g tablets a day. Which will increase as the tolerance goes up
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,That’s actually really great. I had a friend that was on Ritalin and I wish her doctors had monitored her weight better. I had to confront her with her weight issue and she took extreme offense and we’re actually no longer friends. Which is really just her pride because I’ve since been told she’s off of those meds. Good for her. And good for the doctors for monitoring weight in the UK. I wish they did that in the US better.
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,Both. It males it easier but you still have to put in the effort (after the first week honeymoon period wears off)
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"Could the dose have been too low? If I take too little, it might help with mental clarity but not enough to get me off the couch. If I take too much, I feel overstimulated and irritable and I end up unproductive again. There seems to be a sweet spot right in the middle. For me it’s about 7.5mg so I have to cut my tablets to take the most effective dose for myself."
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"One time I was moving out of my apartment on the fifth floor (with elevators of course). I decided I was going to be self sufficient by building my own heavy duty cart. I went to Lowe’s and spent $400+ on parts. The cart was horrendous and could hold a motorcycle of weight. I ended up using it once and gave to a family member and they used it as firewood. Now I check Amazon first, then the Lowes/HD stores."
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,Short dose Adderall did that to me!
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"This is also how I’m feeling - I’ve been on Adderall 5MG IR and my psych mentioned switching to Ritalin. The 90’s kid in me, having seen so many children turn into robots, was immediately deterred. "
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"That's great, a lot of parents feel guilt for not picking up the signs earlier and not doing enough. So, it's important for late diagnosis to check-in on their parents, and remind them they did nothing wrong."
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"Yeah I’ve heard that before about Vyvanse. But why the need to take it every day, tho? As it’s a temporary stimulant, the effects can’t possibly get better after a few consecutive days of taking it, right?"
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,[removed]
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,One year
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,ok. And these are instant release or slow/extended release ?
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"The guidelines are great for sure, however their approach is not. If my response to OP sounded at all bitter/Aggy it's because the people in charge of my care haven't approached me about this subject with sympathy or care at all 😭"
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"That boredom SUCKS so bad. I try to stick to something, but i, just, can’t. It’s super hard. 

This is probably my biggest issue with ADHD."
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"I’m not sure.. just started today, 10mg’s 3x a day.. and I litteraly feel nothing.. maybe a slightly higher heartrate after the first dose but that is it. I am on Omeprazol so I don’t know if that affects it, but I’ve been told it doesn’t"
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"It's an XR and cleaves off, so it probably builds? Something something similar to my anti depressants?"
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"References to Andrew Huberman's content are not allowed.
Though Andrew Huberman is a neuroscientist, he speaks authoritatively on topics outside of his area of practice and expertise. He has a track record of spreading misinformation in the process. For instance, he's claimed that the increase in ADHD diagnoses has been fueled by smartphone usage, which contradicts the ADHD expert consensus.

Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"Meds aren’t magic. They help but our body is quick to build up a tolerance, for me tolerance built up quicker than side effects going away.

From experience, don’t rely entirely on the meds !! Use the period on the meds to build some sort of structure and habits to help you."
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"My dad takes omeprazole so I’m somewhat familiar with it. IIRC, it’s to be taken 30 min before a meal, which is the exact same for Ritalin.  

I’m NAD, but I’ve always read that medications for gastro/reflux issues can affect absorption of other meds. It’s very unusual you’d feel nothing when starting Ritalin at 10mg. **Check with your drs first** but I wonder if it would help to stagger the omeprazole and Ritalin so the Ritalin can be taken first (before a light breakfast), then an hour or two later take the omeprazole followed by a meal or snack as usual. Again, I’m NOT a dr and I’m not trying to give medical advice but I’m curious if there’s a way you can play around with timing of your doses so the Ritalin can be more effective.  

Btw, I googled omeprazole-methylphenidate interactions and I found several threads on this sub about the same thing (that omeprazole renders adhd meds ineffective). You might want to search the sub to see if someone has better advice about it."
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"That’s incorrect. The therapeutic effect of stimulants (including Vyvanse) is instantaneous, they’re useful because of the acute changes they cause in the brain, whereas with antidepressants their efficacy relies on consistent use. Stimulants taken every day without breaks make you build up tolerance and up your dose, so breaks are recommended. It’s not a “break from productivity”, it’s breaks that will prevent you from getting addicted and build tolerance!"
Took my first dose of Ritalin today,"Really?? Thank you for this! I will do some more research on the interactions between the two. I don’t understand why my dr didn’t tell me this. She knows I’ve been on Omeprazol for weeks now..

I like your suggestion, thing is I’ve been told the Omeprazol is to be taken on an empty stomach, an hour before eating.. 

I try not to take the Omeprazol for too long anyways, I wish I didn’t have to take them but I have really bad stomach issues, I get really bad  ulcers, so when I get a flare up I literally can’t function without Omeprazol. When the ulcer is healed after a few weeks I stop taking them again untill I get another one 🥲 it’s a vicious cycle."

My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"Your body chemistry may not be compatible with Ritalin. It happens to about one in ten people with ADHD. Hinging a diagnosis on one of several treatments that aren't effective in all cases is silly. I can't tell you if you've got it or not, but your options may be limited to second line drugs and therapy. I'm sorry this is happening to you, but maybe a second opinion is what's needed here. I know that could be another two years away, but if you can't make headway with your current doctor, another doctor may be more supportive."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,Your psychiatrist is a moron for not knowing about pharmacogenomics
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"That doctor’s logic makes no sense to me. So if someone with serious pain after a surgery doesn’t respond to painkillers, that means they aren’t actually in pain?? Did he get his medical degree from the back of a cereal box?
In all seriousness, yeah, it’s definitely possible to not respond to certain medications. It’s all about trial and error unfortunately. I’m so sorry this is the ordeal you’re facing. Are there other non-stimulant meds you can try?"
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"My psychiatrist says stimulants working for someone is an indicator the diagnosis of ADHD is correct, but not the reverse! Stimulants don't work for everyone. I am fortunate that Vyvanse works for me. Did Ritalin do anything? What dosage was it? "
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"That’s not how medications and diagnoses work. If one medication worked for every person with a disorder, they would never need to develop new ones. There is no medication that is effective for everyone with ADHD, so no doctor can say “if Ritalin doesn’t work for you, then you don’t have ADHD.” That is not logically sound.

I for sure have ADHD and so does most of my family. Neither Concerta nor Vyvanse work for me, I didn’t feel any different. Adderall worked some but exacerbated my heart condition so I can’t take it. So I’ve been unmedicated for like 2 years because none of the meds I’ve tried help my ADHD symptoms and still agreed with the rest of my body. Maybe I’ll find one eventually. But that doesn’t mean I don’t have ADHD, it just means everyone’s bodies are different and meds don’t always work for every person with the ADHD."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,Yeah if you didn't have ADHD I suspect that much Ritalin would feel pretty nasty. It certainly wouldn't do nothing. It's very common to need to try a number of meds before one works properly.
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"It *looks* like I have ADHD, but actually I have an acquired brain injury.  Stimulants make me very anxious, not better focused."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,I was on Ritalin for a year & a half. It stopped affecting me once I quit smoking. My psychiatrist said that it most likely happened due to nicotine being a stimulant / recent weight gain. She switched me to adderall & it’s been an insane difference.
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"Not a comment on your specific circumstance, but several (good) doctors have told me that a response to Ritalin is a confirmation of an ADHD dx. 

ADHD symptoms can appear similar to TBI, historic trauma, and/or illness with “brain fog” components. 

For example, I have a brain fog illness (MCAS) as well as ADHD and can confirm aspects of a MCAS flare feel exactly like my ADHD is untreated or worse, but actually they are two distinct conditions requiring completely seperate treatment."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"I was diagnosed with ADHD by both a psychologist and a psychiatrist a few years ago. After the diagnosis, which came as a slight surprise to me, I learned a lot of things that helped me manage my symptoms. There was a waiting period before I was able to try medication, but even before that, just the knowledge had helped me a lot, so I was excited when I was finally able to try meds. And then… they did absolutely nothing for me. Ritalin, Concerta, Vyvanse, all of them did nothing. I haven’t figured that out yet, and I’m a little bummed but it’s not a huge deal. Because the fact that the diagnosis answered so many of my questions and taught me some coping mechanisms was incredibly helpful on its own. But my point is that your diagnosis shouldn’t be based on your response to medication. Because when Ritalin and others did not work on me, I was *not* told “oops maybe we diagnosed you wrong then.” Cuz that’s not how it works. If you feel like your symptoms align well with ADHD, then there’s a good chance that’s what you have. It took so long for me to figure out because my GP just kept saying “it’s depression” but that really didn’t fit the bill entirely well for me. Learning about ADHD was a game changer. The medication issue is still a mystery to me, but let’s be honest: medication on a whole is still a mystery, even to scientists. Sometimes they know what a drug is doing, but they don’t know why that helps. Sometimes, they don’t even know what a drug is doing but they accidentally discover it helps. Chemistry and the human body is a mystifying combination."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"There are other conditions that can cause symptoms similar to ADHD, but call for different treatments. Has your doctor talked to you at all about other possibilities or testing?

If a high dose of Ritalin doesn’t help and you’ve tried a non-stimulant, you’re probably going to have to use mostly behavioral interventions. Do you exercise? There’s a lot of evidence for exercise being beneficial for ADHD, but it helps a lot of other conditions too."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"Straterra did nothing for me. Adderall is what truly helped me. Any Dr who thinks medication affects all people the same is an idiot at best, and potentially dangerous for the patient at worst."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"Nah. That's BS.

The problem is that it used to be one of the diagnostic methods, and it hasn't entirely fallen out of use.

FWIW, two family members with ADHD are helped by Ritalin, another just gets really bad anxiety.

The one that isn't helped by Ritalin has really good results with Elvanse."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,I don't think there is a drug on the market that is 100% effective in 100% of the population... That's just not how biology works.
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"60 is way too high for a start. A lot of people feel improved focus with low dosages like 10mg or 20mg, while a higher dosage just makes them feel bad. I don't know where you started at, but if the initial dosage was too high, it might be the reason."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,Check if you could try lisdexamferamine instead. Maybe it works better for you.
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"I have real diagnosed ADHD and medications haven't worked for me either, except in terms of controlling appetite. Lots of medications don't work for everyone. Your doc is talking out their ass."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"Adderall does absolutely nothing for me. Long acting, short acting, and like three different dosages. Ritalin works great. Sometimes medications work differently for different people. You’d figure your doctor would have picked that up in med school 😒"
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,That is why there are other meds >.<
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"Your psychiatrist sucks and I'm sorry there aren't other stimulants in your country. If they didn't think you had ADHD, they shouldn't have prescribed you meds... and if they do, the meds not working well isn't proof you don't have ADHD. If I had followed that logic I would be an unmedicated mess right now. Ritalin and Focalin were very hard on my stomach and did not work very well for me. My current meds work. Not every single medication is effective for 100% of patients. IDK what your medical system is like, but if you have the option, it may be worth finding a new doctor. I understand that other stimulant options don't exist for you, but a good doctor wouldn't say you probably don't have ADHD *after prescribing you meds for ADHD*. If their evaluation was ""no ADHD"", then medicating for ADHD wouldn't have even been on the table.

It's possible you have ADHD, and it's possible you have something else - but the doctor's approach here seems very questionable."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"The first three medications and several dosages of the medication that ended up working for me did absolutely nothing. 

Hope you get a better doctor"
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"I'm resistant to every medication I've tried. I still tested off the charts. There's zero question I have ADHD, but I don't respond well to the meds. I've seen several psychiatrists, and never did one suggest me not responding to the meds was a sign I don't have it."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,I have an ADHD diagnosis and Ritalin didn’t work for me either
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"This is almost the opposite of what my psych told me. 

When I started taking Vyvanse I was worried because I heard people are supposed to be jittery on it. She told me that means I definitely have ADHD because if didn't the meds would make me anxious. She ended up going up to 70mg. It actually made my anxiety 300x better."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,There are a large group of people who have ADHD but don’t respond to medication. There was a study recently that found differences in brain structure between those who do and those who don’t [Study linked in this Twitter thread](https://x.com/PsyPost/status/1797962283416699063)
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"was told by my doctor that 80% with adhd responds to medicine, and only 20% with add responds...

so you could just be in the off percentage group...

only good indicator could be if you don't get any boost of concentration or anything from it... (normal people use it as a study drug or party drug for keeping going and going)"
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"See another doctor, if possible. 1 medicine not working for you doesn't mean you don't have ADHD"
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"That's literally the opposite, right? You didn't become jittery, hyperactive, felt like you were ""amped up"" full of energy when you took it?

Because stimulants have an opposite effect on us than non-ADHD folks."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,You should try genesight testing! It shows all types of medications that either do or don’t interact well with your body! The doctor can order this and it’s just a swab of your mouth sent off to a lab. The results are typically received quickly. I work in a nursing home and this is used a lot!
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"Adderall has a negative impact on me, the ADHD is still there"
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD," Adderall had zero effect on me. We tried higher doses, name brand v generic, different forms of release times, and nothing. 

But concerta and focalin? Life savers for me."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"So, imo if you did not have ADHD - Ritalin probably at least would make you high , that is the difference between have ADHD and get medicated , and not have it and get high. 

One guy at my old work looked at me when I took my 70mg Vyvanse, and asked what it did for me; I get more focused, I told him. 
He asked if I could sleep on it, and I answered that there was no problem. 

He asked if he could try one, and I said sure. 

After 1.5 day he called me and asked how the hell he should do to get some sleep 😆"
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,Have you had a neuropsychological evaluation done by a psychologist before? Thats the most accurate way to determine if you have ADHD or not!
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"Can you please go and have a blood test? 

Especially, Serum Iron, Serum Ferritin, Vit B12, Vit D among others. Medication may end up being less effective if you have some deficiency. You might have to specifically ask for Serum iron and Ferritin."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,Well that’s wrong…time for a new doctor!
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"On the flip side, adderall did nothing for me except make me not sleep and feel like I was buzzing. So that’s just not true. Any other meds in your country?"
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,Armodafonil or Modafinil I the answer then. Get a different doctor.
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,Your response to stimulants isn’t a valid diagnostic indicator.
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"I feel like you live in the Middle East. I’ve been looking at jobs in the Middle East and searched for their medication policies and they said they don’t have any stimulants besides Ritalin. Tbh I never took a medication. BUT, maybe find another doctor. But even if the doctor got changed you still have the problem that literally no other medication is available so idk fr.

Edit: my bad you probably live in Hungary"
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,Strattera takes a long time to work (months and months) and the preferred dose is 80mg.  It’s a weird drug.  Wellbutrin is also reported to work.  So you’re not out of options.
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"which country? i am using ritalin same boat only ritalin available here, you might have depression also."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"How ritalin works is it makes for you to do tedious taks easier, that require concentrated focus other than that you wont feel a thing till you do something."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,also take ritalin like 40-45 minutes before  a meal for it wo work well. if you take it with food its absorption is hindered
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,Maybe ask a different doctor for their opinion. I don't take Ritalin and I have severe ADHD (introverted type) but I take Elvanse for a year now and I've never been better :)
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,I eliminated coffee and my meds work way better. I think it has to do with the acidity. I also try to eat a protein filled meal before I take my morning dose. Nutrition can make a big difference.
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"are you consuming the ritalin with a breakfast?

vitamin c/sour food can make the drug way less effective.

look into atomoxetine, guanfacine and bupropion. <- these are often used for adhd and pretty high chance they are legal in your country."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"I came here because I've been on adderal and Vyvanse and Phentermine for over 12 years and just switched to Ritalin...before, my adhd meds would make me super motivated and basically speedy but with brief deep bouts of anxiety, this my nicotine addiction. Ritalin just makes me more focused but there's no extra motivation! I'm not sure if I should switch back because I don't miss that anxious feeling but I miss my willingness to get out and explore the world."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,Your doctor is an idiot 👍🏽
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"“The chemotherapy didn’t work therefore you don’t have cancer.”

Who gives these idiots qualification to practice medicine?"
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"“They did a bunch of bad tests on me, interviews, and my doctor said I probably don’t have adhd”

Did the doctor explain why the tests and interviews made him doubt an adhd diagnosis? Did the doctor have other thoughts on what it is that could be causing your symptoms? 

“My doctor says that the fact that Ritalin had no effect on me is another tell that I DON’t have ADHD.”

To be honest coupled with your doctors original assessment after tests and interviews it IS another tell that your symptoms are not ADHD. 

YOUR DOCTOR DID NOT SAY NO REACTION TO RITALIN IS PROOF OF NO ADHD! Your doctor said it was another mark against the diagnosis. If Ritalin is the only medication offered where you live what do you want your doctor to do for you?

Have you considered other possible diagnosis?"
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"Where do you live? Some remote island? How can only Ritalin exist, literally every drug is imported?"
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"Ask to try Wellbutrin SR, twice a day (not xl). It's off label,  non-stimulant.

  
So there are two reasons why any medication won't work one is genetics, the other is your drug metabolism or pharmacokinetics of CYP450 enzymes. Some people will have a high or low amount of one or more of these drug metabolizing enzymes and you might need a low dose or very high dose depending on if the drug is active and the enzyme breaks it down, or if the drug needs the enzyme to activate the effective metabolite. 

For example I can take the highest dose of Strattera and have zero effect - I mean nothing not even any side effects. Strattera is activated by CYP2D6 enzyme.

  
To be honest, your doctor probably has a strong bias against ADHD medication and clings to this excuse as a rationale to prove they are right/deny medications."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"If you don’t have ADHD and you take Ritalin you experience the effects of a stimulant and become “high”, as in you’ve just taken speed or ice. If you do have ADHD, Ritalin will calm you down and allow you to sort out your mind and feel “normal”. So I would say you do have ADHD and obviously you have not been given the proper medical information."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"This. I tried Ritalin and it did absolutely nothing, zero effect. Tried vyvanse and it worked like a miracle."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"ADHD can be stubborn. Stimulants sort of worked but not well. I had to stop them anyways. Wellbutrin stabilized my mood a bit but did nothing for my ADHD. I’m on Strattera 80mg, and it helps… but I still have major executive function issues.

So, if you have any ideas to share with my psychiatrist, I’m all ears 😉"
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"Its one in ten people with ADHD that don't respond to stimulants. Many people find that they only respond to one of the two types of stimulants (methylphenidate and amphetamines). Which is why its standard procedure to try the alternative when one doesn't work, rather than to take it as a sign that the diagnosis is incorrect."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"So I've been going through doubts lately. I'm on Adderall, which helps very mildly, but before that I was on 10mg of Vyvanse and after about two hours I thought I'd gone deaf because my head went totally silent. 

Does that mean I definitely have ADHD? Do stimulants do that to people who don't have it?"
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"Came here to say this!!!! Yes, yes, yes!!!! Like, my whole family has adverse reactions to the Ritalin family and Adderall does wonders."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"He’s right. Everyone has different enzymes. My doctor told me that. Again, I would get another foctor"
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"To be fair - this was the advice of the major ADHD expert doctors for years. I won’t name names, but we all know them.

I was even trained this way. The slide presentations from the last decade at least advise doctors to consider different diagnoses if the patient is one of the 15% of people not getting a benefit from stimulants.

(Not defending this way of thinking, but that’s what it was.)"
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"This is the way.  ADHD is not a “treatment diagnosis” like Parkinson’s where the patient’s positive response to the medication is what confirms/completes the diagnosis.

God, I wish it were, though.  The implication would be that there was a single treatment mechanism that worked on everyone, and diagnosis were solid confirmable things that every third medical “professional” didn’t question or debate."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"We went up to 30mg and it was like taking sugar pills. Nothing. I was so frustrated I took two doses so 60mg and it’s hard to describe the nauseating feeling I had from it - like when you do a ketogenic diet and you feel out of energy for a month. Like I could faint standing up. 

I read about people who take 120-200mg of ritalin a day, albeit divided up. She did not want to try a larger dose with me, though it makes some sense to me if no medication ever had an effect on me, maybe I have a low metabolism or something and I need a larger dose. (Side point but: She said if anything it’s probably the opposite and I have a fast metabolism rate. This made absolutely no sense to me. I have always been fat even when exercising.)"
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"Thanks. Luckily they are not throwing me out like my previous ADHD psych, they are treating me for depression right now with Wellbutrin plus other stuff, …but it’s all pretty useless as previously before even thinking about ADHD I was treated with literally 7-12 different medications (anti depr/psychotics/anxiety) and none of them worked. I am resistant to literally everything, even side effects I only got once or twice.

They will be trying shock therapy and other stuff, but as you know if ADHD is the root cause, treating depression/anxiety won’t do anything at all.

I have been on this path for over 13 years and I tried everything including exercise, diet, meditation, therapy, hormones and every treatment in those bullshit Top10 internet articles or otherwise."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"Unfortunately they just told me the Vyvanse that was supposed to be introduced in Autumn is not coming until at least next year due to paperwork issues. 

Typical. Not that I have high hopes for it working but I’ll still try anything, no matter how painful"
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"Started with 10, got 30, I experimented with 60 as I was desperate for a cure. You know how desperate"
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,Unfortunately here we only have Ritalin and a strattera type. Hopefully next year they don’t mess up the paperwork for the introduction of Vyvanse
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,I was feeling faint on 60mg but perhaps I should have went up to 60-90mg and stayed with it for weeks so it balances out.
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"Yup. My doctors doubt my adhd diagnosis because vyvanse makes me rage out & I can feel my heart beating & blood circulating.

It mildly increases my blood pressure."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"This is what I said to my doctor, that surely normal people respond to it and the fact that I don’t feel anything is an indicator that I am not “normal”. That’s when she said the above line unfortunately"
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"100% not true. Stimulants works on humans, period. Adhd or not, has nothing to do with it"
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"Didn’t feel anything at all at 30mg.

60mg I was feeling faint and tired."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,I told her I wanted to do it and she was dismissive. I don’t think this country has genetic testing unfortunately
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"They did a bunch of tests including computer attention test, IQ test, paper tests etc. and they said I didn’t have ADHD.

It was weird because I felt super impulsive on that computer test when you weren’t supposed to press space on the letter X. I almost felt like they accidentally swapped my results for someone else’s. I got a bit slower at the end but that’s it.

IQ test was 117 but could have been 120 because I didn’t fucking know the country’s trivia questions as I have zero interest in that stuff. If it was world trivia I would have gotten 125 overall I think lol

The only test test that was bad was the stroop test. You can download a free app for it. Basically you need to press the color of the word presented in front of you. But when it says “Blue” in green letters it was super confusing to me. Like my mind was working faster and running into loops that confused me. (Fun fact that this is an indication of hepatic encephalopathy, when your liver is toxic and it messes with your brain, but I most certainly don’t have this issue)"
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"Thanks.

I had plenty of blood tests over the years for a bunch of hormonal stuff but they very well could have missed iron deficiency. I’ll check the results but they probably did check iron, b12 and things of that nature unfortunately. 

The only thing high is kreatinin, which can cause gouts. My normal doctor wants to treat me for that but he doesn’t understand these issues are far down on my health list after ADHD, and pretty much wanting to off myself due to my issues. I was thinking whether high kreatinin that makes your blood acidic could like kill the effectiveness of medications, but that’s a stupid thought right?"
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"Yes unfortunately Middle / Eastern Europe is also quite bad for treating psych issues, but I guess most countries have nothing at all"
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"I took strattera for multiple months, went up to like 80-90mg. I feel much worse since stopping to take it, but it’s not necessarily from the medication. Sounds stupid but I had ups and downs before, as you just… get bored and burn out of “believing” in cures. Belief and placebo is the most powerful drug. 

Unfortunately it is quite expensive to buy strattera every month so that was another reason I quit. I don’t want to buy something expensive I don’t 100% know helped me. If I don’t get better from just wellbutrin I will return to strattera though"
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,Hungary
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,I took it with protein because I heard kind of the opposite: that protein helps it absorb
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"Waiting for Vyvanse next year as it was supposed to arrive in Autumn but surprise surprise they messed up the paperwork. So holding out. It’s just hard as like I wrote I have been holding out for so many years. I don’t feel good since I started nursery/school age 6, since I had social and work responsibilities basically. And I am nearly 30. 

Hoping that this struggle is for making me stronger and not destroying me entirely"
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"I am very acidic (high creatinine levels, like gout makjng stuff) and I wonder if the acid is the thing killing all these medications’ effects. 

Eliminating creatinine is very hard though, and often clashes with a low carb / sugar diet I am also supposed to be on. But like I wrote before, even when I was the fittest health of my life it didn’t really help “my issues”, so I ignore these creatinine and other health issues for now UNTIL I can fix the mental stuff. 

I’m not saying there’s no point fixing blood sugar when you are bleeding to death, but it’s much easier afterwards."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"Unfortunately ADHD is the last in line of trying other stuff. Like I said 5-6 depression meds didn’t work, hormones, exercise and dozens of other cures, tests, fixes. 

I wouldn’t doubt the non-ADHD diagnosis if I had other options or if treating the symptoms also helped a lot. If I DO have ADHD, treating the depression won’t do anything at all. I must treat the root cause or be destroyed by it."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"I thought about this, too. In my opinion, OP should try to get a second opinion, but if that doctor says the same thing, he should just accept it"
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"Unfortunately I felt neither high nor calm. It was nothing at 30mg, and 60mg I felt tired and fainting. 

Others said one ADHD med might not work at all, but other meds could."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"I've heard that from quite a few people. Although, for a while, smoothies are a staple in their diet after starting Vyvanse. I am still the same, but I never tried Ritalin"
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,I Hope this is the case for me. I tried Ritalin years ago to no effect.
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"This is good to know, I am on 40mg Ritalin and it does nothing. I get occasional jitters depending on where I am in my menstrual cycle but that’s it. I can still nap etc even though I’m on long release.. 

Vyvanse isn’t funded where I am currently, but may shell out to try it."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,That's nuts because the ONLY thing straterra did for me was remove my executive dysfunction.
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"That's what stimulants do for people with ADHD. I wept the first time my medication kicked in because my thoughts went quiet for the first time in my life and I could focus on one thing or conversation at a time. Stimulants do the opposite if you DON'T have ADHD. 


Edit to clarify: medication doesn't always work for everyone who has ADHD. Some people with ADHD just don't respond to meds at all. But I don't know if it's possible to not have ADHD and not get a euphoric high from a stimulant. "
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"I was like that my first few days on Vyvanse. It was so jarring, but now I'm on my maintenance dose, and it's working wonders for me. I've git a good balance in my brain where it's still active, but I'm able to process the world around me much better."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"I am that less than 1% (I think it's like 0.1%) of people who tend to experience parallel effects, so what the medication does to me is the opposite of what it does to everyone else. They gave me a common sleeping medication to help once, and then I started running around like a dog with the zoomies. I baked so many treats that night 😅"
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"I've seen so many mental health professionals, and it took forever to get my ADHD diagnosis because it wasn't super in your face. I found out that females tend to internalise hyperactivity, and I was like, ohhhhh, so that's what that was. I even had a psychiatrist tell me once I was just lazy, and now that I've gotten actual help, I'm actually doing pretty well for myself. Found a great psychiatrist who I share a lot in common with, which is helpful."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"Damn, that is crazy to me. Glad times have changed"
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"I metabolise stimulants quickly. That is different than how you metabolise food. I don't know if you are taking long acting Ritalin, but I have done better on immediate release. Every ADHD medication I've taken has worked for me except for extended release Ritalin. I used to be on 20mg 3x a day, but I've lowered it to 15mg 3x a day. I also take Intuniv which is a nonstimulant. The first week or so Intuniv made me sleepy, but after that it worked.

I know you don't want to hear this, but diet and exercise also makes a huge difference. It's how I've been able to lower the stimulant dose"
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"for me, most of my symptomatic load was due to unrecognized sleep apnea. Don't need to be overweight, don't need to snore, don't have to have any obvious symptoms -- I didn't even know how physically tired/exhausted I was due to not knowing any other state. Anybody who claims otherwise is simply misinformed, yet such misinformation is wide-spread even among non-specialized doctors.


Highly recommend checking out that possibility. I've still got ADHD of course, but Atomoxetine works well enough. (Stims would be a little better, but I can't take them anymore, and Atomoxetine works 24/7 which is nice.) 


Treatment for OSA pretty much saved my life. 


Also, OSA is very much under-diagnosed and seems to be correlated with ADHD (as well as conditions like Autism)."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"Have they looked at possible underlying physical causes? Maybe even nutritent deficiencies? Wellbutrin is used to treat ADHD too.

Are your symptoms primarily inattentive or hyperactive? Or both?"
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"Oh dang Wellbutrin was my next suggestion. It does help with ADHD off label sometimes. Have you tried it together with Ritalin? For some people that helps. But mostly it sounds like you need meds your country doesn't allow. You could see if Guanfacine is available, but at this point you're doing the doctor's job for them."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"If you ever need surgery, please make sure the anesthesiologist knows that a lot of meds have basically no effect on you! IDK if your resistance would include anesthetics or not, but waking up during surgery is so horrific that you wouldn't want to take any chances.



I'm sorry that meds aren't working for you though. I assume they've checked for issues with your thyroid since you mentioned hormones? Because I know a wonky thyroid can really mess up your metabolism (which can include how you metabolize drugs) and it also can have symptoms that overlap with various mental health conditions, so one can hide the other. 


Regardless of any of that, I hope you find a treatment combination that works well for you. Figuring out meds can be a long slow road and it sounds like yours is unusually tough"
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"I would ask them for genetic testing. I just had a report done. Out of all the antidepressants there are. Only 3 will work as prescribed. I'm on one of the 3 at max dosage, and it's not working.

There are only 3 stimulants and 1 non stimulant that is supposed to work on me. Adderall gave me a high heart rate. I'm currently on Ritalin 20mg twice daily, and it's not doing anything. If the Ritalin doesn't work with further increases, I'm switching to focalin. I think I'm going to ask my doc to add guanfacine to the mix. By itself, didn't help. But it is supposed to work better with a stimulant.

I'm currently working through ADHD (inattentive), BPD, MDD, CPSTD, chronic pain, insomnia, Dysgraphia. I have other recent heath issues due to all of this. So lots of cormortalitys make treatments difficult. I have only been at this for 5 months with meds, and a year in bi-weekly therapy. It's behond frustrating. I want to quit and bed rot 24/7. I am unable to thanks to everything being one vicious cycle. Thankfully, I have a loving wife with excellent mental health care. Eventually, things will work themselves out, and meds will start working. Untill that happens, I'm stuck. 

I wish you well on your journey to recovery.



Edit, grammar error"
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"What are you doing physically? Are you exercising? Are you taking vitamins? If you're thinking the medicine will make it go away but you're not implementing a better routine or trying a new habit, it won't matter what you take. :/ 
And it may not be all adhd.. other things have cross over symptoms. If you're obsessing over this one path it's going to mess with your progress"
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"Whilst Wellbutrin is an antidepressant, it can actually be used specifically for ADHD as well. 

I can’t take stimulants due to other medical conditions, but Wellbutrin makes it easier for me to start tasks. I have no idea why, it is also used to help people stop smoking, so I guess it can help with impulses. It has helped level out my mood as well. 

I still have bad days with a lot of brain fog, but it is something. Obviously, only you can say if it works for you, but don’t write it off as ‘not an ADHD med’ as lots of us find it effective. 

Strattea worked slightly better, but I had the rare side effect of constant tachycardia and my doctor said it was too dangerous. 

I was misdiagnosed with Bipolar Disorder, and none of those meds helped. Made things worse if anything."

My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"To be fair.. I have to agree that if they did the full neuropsych evaluation, including the TOVA tests (the computer one), and you’re not responding to any ADHD medication.. the reality is you likely don’t have it. Impulsivity is not strictly a symptom of ADHD.. it falls under many other conditions! What did the results of that evaluation indicate diagnosis wise? A lot of other conditions can present as ADHD but aren’t.. but also vice versa! The cognitive testing that you went through is what helps determine whether symptoms are caused by attention deficit or other causes. It seems like you scored well attention and focus wise.. so it’s difficult for them to justify attention deficit if you didn’t display it during the testing.. especially the TOVA test that actually measures your right and wrong responses as well as your response speed. It provides actual scoring as to how well you pay attention.. and it’s normal for anyone to not be perfect.. but it’s the degree of distraction that indicates whether it’s an attention deficit or not! 

You can always get a second test done with another psychologist to get a second opinion.. however they’ll do the same tests. They’re all standard tests used across the board to diagnose.. so it won’t be much different!"

My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"Same here I'm f, 26, and I actually got my second assesment last year. I got my first when I was 7 but me having AD(H)D was dismissed because my grades were too good. Suffered all my life and developed depression from early childhood that got treated instead :/"
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"OMG thanks for the idea I NEVER thought of FREAKING SMOOTHIES!!!! 
I've lost 10 kilos in like 3 months after I started taking elvanse or vyvanse as you call it. Pants don't fit me anymore just weeks after I bought them. Yesterday was another day where I didn't eat again =_= And on days where I eat I'm glad if I get to the 1200 kcal that I burn on a daily basis..."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"Thank you. That's what I was looking for - my mom keeps sending me articles about how ADHD should be the last thing doctors suspect, and, like... they've been treating the depression and anxiety for *twenty years*.  

Then the *lowest* dose of Vyvanse shut my entire brain up, and I was like ***oh***. I wish my mom understood."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"I sure hope so..although my last dr just a few months ago also doubts my adhd diagnosis due to my experience on stimulants…

Hopefully things will change soon."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"I have a bunch of different specific symptoms but I wasn’t the typical hyperactive boy as a child. The first time I suspected that I could have it and be masking was when I watched Harley Therapy’s video on Youtube. I have better than average intelligence and I always sort of “cram” studied so I got good grades, but fell apart in College, similarly to what the Harley Therapy guy described. 

My mind is like a radio, it actually takes longer to fall asleep when I am in completely darkness by myself. I bother people, I was the class clown, all of the people who know me would describe me as having ADHD (if they knew what it was in the first place)."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"I was taking the Strattera of this country + our version of Wellbutrin and it seems to have helped subtly, but I am very very suspicious that I just burnt the hell out again, and the meds didn’t affect anything. This cycle happens all the time, but it’s not bipolar.

I was heart broken because they are bringing in Vyvanse this Autumn and my DR just told me they fucked up the paperwork so it’s not coming then."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,Good thought!
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"I asked them for genetic testing and they were dismissive of it from the get go. I wouldn’t be surprised if there was no genetic testing here at all. 

My previous therapist told me she had to get an online qualification for Personality Disorders because they don’t really teach it here at all. That was a time I suspected I had Borderline Personality Disorder but she thought otherwise. After a year and a half she could only say I had “a combination of personality disorders”, which suspiciously sounds like every person ever. She couldn’t even say a combination of which disorders out of the 10."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"I’ve had periods of my life when I was exercising super intensively and I cooked every day to keep my diet. It didn’t help nearly enough. It was always like a second job and sucked ass. I didn’t really feel different when I gained more than 50% of my weight which is insane. And by the way, there were multiple periods of multiple months of exercising heavily, I’m not talking about doing it for 2 weeks and quitting.

Although This indicates a hormone issue like hypo-thyroid or low testosterone, but years of talking to endocrinologists and taking hormones for these / trying different stuff and blood tests indicates it’s no hormone issue. 

Obviously I have blood sugar issues but how should I say it… it’s like a drop in the sea? I was doing blood sugar tests and it dropped so hard they thought I was gonna faint. I felt nothing, like it’s normal every day. I don’t know if it’s my depersonalization shielding me from pain or what. It annoys me when doctors want to treat me for all these “side issues”"
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,Thank you. To you as well if you need it
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"I feel your sorrow not only as sympathy, but empathy. 
Hoping you get the life you deserve soon."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"I feel that I lost almost 20kg in 3 months 😅 I've still got another 10/15kg to go, then I'll be at my goal weight, but we're really trying to slow it down at the moment to stabilise me before I start losing weight again and high protein smoothies have been so helpful and I'm bring forced to confront my toxic relationship with food through all this. Being exposed to the insanity of Heroine Chic, understanding what was happening, and seeing the effects on those I loved before primary school wasn't helpful 🙃 swung like a wrecking ball through a lifetime of EDs/disordered eating at both ends of the scale."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"You should see a clinical psychologist and be properly tested. The gentic testing is sound science. It will narrow down what medication will work immensely. Just need to find the right dosage.

I need something to work because nothing has helped outside of brief moments of clarity. I need to get back to actual work. I have done site work and underground utilities for the past 16 years. I tried to go back to work after 2 years from an injury. I had a nervous breakdown the first day i was to start work. Im still not properly functioning a year later. I can not safely operate anything for 10 hours a day like this or deal with the horrible central florida traffic from my house to the site and back.

The issue with bpd is that it looks a lot like bi-polar. The main difference is that your mood changes for a reason, and you take it to the extreme. It's emotional disregulation but more complex. Like I'm angry and irritable all the time over the simplest things. I react immediately, and my first thought is to rip someone's head off. I have to stop myself and realize what's happening in a split second. 90% of the time, it's a me issue. I misinterpret or overreacted. It's mostly due to triggers from trauma. The worst bpd thing is a favorite person. I almost ruined my marriage twice. But I digress, I have limited understanding of bipolar 1 & 2. What I do know is that mania can last long periods of time, days, or weeks. The same goes for depression. It can because of no reason or triggers."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"Blood sugar is a huge factor in how we feel. Eating enough protein helps adhd medicine work better and also keeps your blood sugar more balanced. Exercising heavily with blood sugar issues isn't going to make you feel better. I'd argue it makes you feel worse bc you're burning through whatever balance you have. Light walking and a balanced diet with enough protein will help. I recommend looking into the diabetes exchange diet. I followed it when I was pregnant. I wasn't diabetic but I felt so hungry and gross all the time, and it helped me a lot. 
Treating ""side issues"" is annoying, but they are contributing to your mental health, too!"
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"The funny thing is that I finally got in peace with my body and how it looks. I didn't want to loose weight. I just ate the same amount of food I always ate before ^^"""
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"Sounds weird, but I don’t really feel any different when my blood sugar is super low. It feels the same when it’s high vs. when it’s low. Idk if it’s the depersonalization or just having bigger issues on the table at the moment. I believe blood sugar to be of a much smaller issue than my other issues at the moment."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"Yeah, that's less than ideal 😅 I've known people who didn't want to lose weight on meds, so they started making these smoothies and loading them with as many nutrients as possible. Protein powders, frozen fruit/veg, milk, yoghurt, ice cream, anything else they could think of. Worked really well for them. You'd see them sipping on these fancy ass smoothies they'd make, which would cost you an arm and a leg if you bought it."
My Psychiatrist says Ritalin not having any effect on me means I don’t have ADHD,"It's an easy thing to address, especially when your medication options are limited in your country. If adhd medicine or other meds aren't working, you have to try other things."

"Does adhd medications (specifically concerta, ritalin) shorten your life?",I don't know if ADHD medication shortens your life. But I do in fact know that you shorten your life if you take NO medication. There are many studies about that topic ;-)
"Does adhd medications (specifically concerta, ritalin) shorten your life?","Generally they raise it. Untreated ADHD results in way more car accidents and accidental injury than the general public, along with a high risk of substance abuse and risk-taking behavior."
"Does adhd medications (specifically concerta, ritalin) shorten your life?",The opposite. Untreated ADHD shortens your life by 10 years. We have Forget Stove is On Syndrome after all. My meds have never increased my blood pressure or heart rate.
"Does adhd medications (specifically concerta, ritalin) shorten your life?","More studies show dopamine deficiencies (hello ADHD) in general increases the risk of Alzheimer’s and dementia later in life. 

My father in law was recently diagnosed with Parkinson’s (not related to a dopamine issue) and his neurologist was in general talking about how untreated depression, anxiety and ADHD leads to MANY more brain function issues later in life.

If you follow controlled doses under the supervision of your doctor it will actually increase your life expectancy. Definitely talk to your doctor about any concerns you have."
"Does adhd medications (specifically concerta, ritalin) shorten your life?","I’ve been taking adhd stimulant meds for 15+ years now and have had no health impacts/problems whatsoever. In fact, my blood pressure is excellent and borderline low. So just based on personal experience I don’t think the meds are shortening my life. 

I’m sure going around unmedicated the last 15 years would have given me a much higher chance of shortening my life - untreated adhd can be very dangerous."
"Does adhd medications (specifically concerta, ritalin) shorten your life?","A short life well lived is better than a long life wasted. One is living, the other is tantamount to waiting in a bus stop for a bus never to arrive.

I remember reading the Wiki article about Methylphenidate and other stimulants that *may* cause dyskinesia. But that's later in life and is exceedingly rare in therapeutic doses."
"Does adhd medications (specifically concerta, ritalin) shorten your life?","Before meds I had burgers and fries at least 3 times each week. Like clockwork at 4pm I would get bored and browse the food delivery apps. That’s completely stopped after starting meds. Win!

I would exercise very randomly. Basically it was all dependent on how I felt in the morning or evening. Following a training plan was nearly impossible. I was in shape but never achieved any my specific goals. Now I am following selfmade very short fitness schedules and I have not missed a day since 2 months.

My mood is so much better. Earlier I would ruminate on past failures almost everyday. Now I am at so much peace

My rate was around 57 and now it’s 67 so +10 but I feel I can bring it back down. Also no change in BP.

Overall I prefer a life with meds than without. I may have to tweak my life to account for the extra work my heart does. A better diet. More omega 3. But that’s easily doable:"
"Does adhd medications (specifically concerta, ritalin) shorten your life?","I've been suffering from depression and anxiety. These alone reduce life expectancy already. Then the anti-depressant raised my blood pressure, so I had to take medication for that, too. This does harm the liver in the long-term, too. The stress resulting from that, also a factor.

They are probably caused by the untreated ADHD, so ADHD itself also shorter lifespan. Now medication on top, another factor. 

Then I got overweight after starting medication with anti-depressants and did do less and less sport and physical activity. Also not great.

So basically, I'm f\*cked. 

I started to work out regularly a couple of years ago and since this year, I'm working out almost every day. Now with ADHD diagnosis and medication, I maybe can effectively battle the anxiety and resulting depression and possibly get off anti-depressant medication. So there's hope I can at least to some degree, prolong my life expectancy again.

Ohhh and not to forget, ADHD, anxiety and depression and stress are also responsible for higher risk in dementia. Got a real thing going for me. Maybe I'll just forget my problems and shorter life expectancy at some point."
"Does adhd medications (specifically concerta, ritalin) shorten your life?",They only shorten it if you have a heart condition and you're unlucky. Generally you shouldn't take stimulants with such conditions.
"Does adhd medications (specifically concerta, ritalin) shorten your life?","stimulant medication saved my life. even if it did shorten my life, i'd still take it because it has made my life liveable and worth living. i'd rather my life be short and sweet than long and torturous. imho way too many people prioritize length of life over quality of life ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
"Does adhd medications (specifically concerta, ritalin) shorten your life?","I have been taking Ritalin for 35+ years.  I'm 47, run 4 miles a day and have a resting HR in the 50s.  I've never had a single health issue due to Ritalin"
"Does adhd medications (specifically concerta, ritalin) shorten your life?","A quick search for papers on this revealed the following:

From [Mick, McManus, and Goldberg (2013)](https://doi-org.libproxy.umflint.edu/10.1016/j.euroneuro.2012.06.011):

>In 2665 patients from 10 trials, we observed that use of CNS stimulants was associated with an increase in heart rate of approximately 5 bpm and an increase in systolic or diastolic blood pressure of 1.2 mmHg. We also noted a low overall risk (≤5%) of clinically significant cardiovascular events, including tachycardia or hypertension.

From [Westover and Halm (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2261-12-41):

>Findings of an association between prescription stimulant use and adverse cardiovascular outcomes are mixed. Studies of children and adolescents suggest that statistical power is limited in available study populations, and the absolute risk of an event is low. More suggestive of a safety signal, studies of adults found an increased risk for transient ischemic attack and sudden death/ventricular arrhythmia. Interpretation was limited due to differences in population, cardiovascular outcome selection/ascertainment, and methodology.

Of course, this is just two papers out of many, but these papers suggest the risk is quite low."
"Does adhd medications (specifically concerta, ritalin) shorten your life?",Dude I wouldn’t want to live a longer life without being treated; not being treated is what led to a period of suicidal thoughts when I was younger.
"Does adhd medications (specifically concerta, ritalin) shorten your life?","Idk, but I’m willing to risk a heart attack over dying in a car crash or not being able to hold down a job.

I do think it’s an important thing to consider when deciding whether to go on medication or not. All medication has side effects and stimulants can cause long-term complications They are life-saving medications for many people, but it is also true that others can manage their ADHD using therapy and exercise. 

My view is that you shouldn’t be on medication for something you *can* manage without it, BUT you also need to objectively evaluate whether or not you truly are able to manage it effectively without medication. The same is true when it comes to increasing your dose btw! Your goal should be to stay on the lowest dose possible for the shortest amount of time **without sacrificing your overall quality of life.** No point in living a few extra years if you’re miserable!"
"Does adhd medications (specifically concerta, ritalin) shorten your life?","They technically do but the benefits of properly treated ADHD as a result of taking them lengthen your life by much more than that, so it's a net positive."
"Does adhd medications (specifically concerta, ritalin) shorten your life?","I'd rather live a good life, not a long life."
"Does adhd medications (specifically concerta, ritalin) shorten your life?","They don't necessarily put your bp or heart rate to a level that has negative impacts on health markers.
I personally have low diastolic bp without them and normal BP with them.

You're also more likely to die from kidney damage than heart damage with chronic high BP as it has a massive impact on your kidneys."
"Does adhd medications (specifically concerta, ritalin) shorten your life?","Normally they don't do that, actually quite the opposite since people are less stressed, motivated to eat cleaner, motivated to exercise, etc. 

But if you are me the medication may Reduce my lifespan drastically since my resting heartrate is 130 and peaks 210 in sport. Sadly I need them and there is no other way, since only stimulants work..."
"Does adhd medications (specifically concerta, ritalin) shorten your life?","My blood pressure is almost hypotension levels. 90/60. My resting heart rate went from 80bpm to 65bpm since starting ritalin. 

Now this is mostly due to me finally being able to eat and exercise properly for the first time in my life, which I couldn't before the medication. So overall I'd say the ritalin has increased my health."

"Does adhd medications (specifically concerta, ritalin) shorten your life?","So far as I have read this is a misunderstanding. I think the meds are hard on people who already have chronic heart conditions, but if you’re in good shape so far as I’m aware it’s more of a risk not to be on them (car accidents, spontaneous sex, wreckless decisions, etc). A lot of health care is choosing what the least worst decision is and you can’t know until you try.

I’m an extremely cautious, paranoid, and suspicious person and I’m happy on them, take that as you will.

EDIT: I’m on Vyvanse."
"Does adhd medications (specifically concerta, ritalin) shorten your life?","In a vacuum, yes.  

But compared to ADHD, no.

ADHD shortens your life.  Basically any bad outcome you can think of, ADHD increases the likelihood, amd medication helps.

Drunk driving, teenage pregnancy, STDs, domestic violence, car crashes, incarceration, drug addiction....the list goes on.

"Does adhd medications (specifically concerta, ritalin) shorten your life?",Having my adhd properly treated with vyvanse and Prozac actually lowered my blood pressure and resting heart rate. Untreated adhd in modern society is extremely stressful to your body.
"Does adhd medications (specifically concerta, ritalin) shorten your life?","Increase in blood pressure isnt bad for you. Only over a certain threshhold. 

So you dont need to worry about this if youre at risk which is why when on medication you check blood pressure frequently.

You may be 20 points under having high blood pressure, and meds increase BP by 1 point causing no problem. If you're 1 point off high BP and  meds increase BP by 1 point then it may be a problem. 
(Ik terminology is wrong and BP isnt one unit im soeaking hypothetically) 

But if you're BP is thay high, then you need to worry about a lot more than just meds. You need to worry about your entire lifestyle

I would be more worried about HRV and ECG than BP when it comes to medications but even they can be misleading and i wouldnt worry about minor hicups only major ones

This is not medical advice i am not a doctor"
"Does adhd medications (specifically concerta, ritalin) shorten your life?",My resting heart rate and blood pressure decreased when I started on elvanse - probably because I wasn’t so frustrated and stressed about all the shit I didn’t do
"Does adhd medications (specifically concerta, ritalin) shorten your life?","As far as I understand it, if you take the meds then the effect they have on people with ADHD is pretty much the opposite of that happens to those who don't. For us it helps to level us out and enables you to keep your ducks in a row, so it shouldn't really affect your heart rate and blood pressure. You'll be monitored every year by your doctor to make sure nothing is spiking in that regard, at least that's the case in the UK.   
If you don't need the meds then it would be like taking uppers and your heart rate etc. will skyrocket."
"Does adhd medications (specifically concerta, ritalin) shorten your life?","something that was found was that people who need medication but have been denied medication may look for self medicating solutions, street druggs

"Does adhd medications (specifically concerta, ritalin) shorten your life?","My psychiatrist says that most patients have lower blood pressure once they're medicated, because, even though the medicine may increase it, the reduction in stress level outweighs this.

"Does adhd medications (specifically concerta, ritalin) shorten your life?","OK a few things to keep in mind. Most of the time children experience more severe side effects(which is why the dosage is usually smaller) and this is important because most of the data we have is on children. That said, raised blood pressure and heart rate aren't that common. One study took 736 teenagers taking methylphenidate(ritalin) and compared the results to a placebo group of 368.  12.2% of the methylphenidate group had elevated BP and 9.6% in the placebo group. Also the elevations in BP are usually small. If you're worried there are some things you can do like take magnesium, eat more fruits and veggies, replace your salt with a potassium based substitute(there are mixtures of potassium and sodium salt but there isn't a pure potassium salt), stop drinking coffee."

i had been dissociated for a full year, had to ask other worldly forces to aid me. inconsistently used vyvanse and adderall, because i went through my scripts in weeks, one time a couple days. better now, just smoke herba, occasional stims for homework but its a rule that i should only do it for a day or two. i went through a horrible depression because i fucked around and found out. Sorry this is unrelated, the next paragraph is my answer.

Do they shorten your life? yeah and worse if abused, obviously. One would assume CNS Stim medication that increases heart rate and blood pressure for a select number of years would and most likely would have negative consequences on your future wellbeing. Pls be safe mane"
"Does adhd medications (specifically concerta, ritalin) shorten your life?","Adhd meds do not aways raise blood pressure. Mine goes down on stimulant meds, because they reduce my anxiety.

It’s a double edged sword I suppose. I think we are finding surprising evidence everyday in the medical field that disproves a lot we thought was concrete.

People who have the forgetful or inattentive symptoms in serious situations because it’s to that extent, are at a serious risk of a life altering or ending mistake or judgment call. 

That being said, stimulant medications as you stated do elevate heart rate, blood pressure etc… 
Of course that puts mileage on your organs. It’s not good for you physically, however it is often a net positive for people with ADHD. When it comes to lifespan that’s case to case depending on what behaviours you chase your dopamine with to cope with being unmedicated. 

There’s obviously long term side affects to taking an amphetamine based medication though. I’d say you live a shorter life if you don’t make any life altering mistakes due to your ADHD/ use drugs to cope. Probably a better one though. I’m not a doctor. Talk to yours."

She's never had any patients with cardiovascular issues that seemed to be associated with their stimulants (such as it being more related to stress or existed prior to going on stimulants), so she had been frustrated with a lot of the studies that were using old assumptions or clumped together all adrenergic agonists, like pseudoephedrine & meth, with methylphenidate & adderall. It does say that methylphenidate (Ritalin or Cotempla like I'm on to avoid metabolism interactions via CYP3A4) causes less acute blood pressure increases.

"Does adhd medications (specifically concerta, ritalin) shorten your life?","Literally everything is chemicals! Water is a chemical. It's a universal solvent! The natural vs chemical is fear-mongering. There can be good and bad chemicals, just like there can be good and bad ""natural"" stuff. Asbestos and cyanide are 100% natural, just straight up get it out of nature. Eat more than a few of the wrong almonds and that's it.

I used to think like this, and I wish I had learned this earlier. Starting with medication earlier on can actually help your brain grow better pathways because it's not stressed out, and make the ADHD symptoms less severe when older. ADHD and medication is one of the most studied ""disorders"" there is. It's heavily scrutinized.

My heart rate is a bit higher on medication, but without it my body is constantly exposed to my own, natural way more harmful chemicals like cortisol (stress) and messes with your own body's ability to regulate itself. ADHD medication is nothing different from any other medical treatment, and many medications started out ""natural"" but we learned to make the exact same thing ourselves so we didn't have to strip down entire rainforests for it. Literally the same molecules.

And then we learned you can change that recipe a little and it does something similar, but different! Maybe better! (And sometimes worse, but that's why we have a need to do studies and apply the scientific method first!)

I get the idea of it feeling scary because it's ""a chemical"", but I seriously mean it when I say raspberries are chemicals.

Note the more recent 32 studies that show that children, adolescents and young adults who take ADHD medications long-term have brain development that is closer to normal than those with ADHD who were never treated, known as neuroprotection. That is not to say that the medicines do not potentiate any side effects. They do. And they can be quite annoying.

"Does adhd medications (specifically concerta, ritalin) shorten your life?","Hello! ADHD pharmacy student here with some fun facts!!!

**ADHD has a high societal and economic burden.** We can do the math and find out that people with untreated ADHD have higher rates of unemployment, productivity loss, and increased healthcare costs (e.g. you're not on medication, so you get into more car accidents, emergencies or mental health crises). As such, **taking ADHD medication reduces the societal, financial, and emotional burden of ADHD.** You live a happier life with less crises, less late fees, etc. Think about how we prescribe drugs for high cholesterol and high blood pressure - long term, it reduces the chance for more catastrophic heart issues (e.g. stroke) and is really helpful in reducing total emotional, physical and cost burdens. 

**Stimulants have been proven safe in long-term studies. Higher blood pressure or heart rate is noted as one very common side effect, but long-term EKG changes or heart issues are not an issue**. Admittedly, there are a lack of good studies in this area because prescribers are comfortable prescribing stimulants long-term. Most of the studies follow up at around the 2 year mark, and are not super large (n = 100-200 ish). Again, this is because these drugs are highly effective have been available for a long time so pharma companies are less incentivized to do large, expensive long term studies. As ADHD gets diagnosed more, I expect to see more long-term cohort control studies in the future. 

This is all to say that **we should be taking medication if we need it**. If you need them and they will lead to a better life for you, then whats the harm? It leads to better outcomes for you at work, in relationships, in day-to-day functioning, financially, and so much more. If my chemicals are out of balance, then why shouldn't I fix it with other chemicals? 

**My family members don't like taking medications for their blood pressure and cholesterol,** because **'I'd rather manage it naturally, it's too many chemicals'.** They change their tune very quickly when I show them large studies showing decreased stroke, heart attacks, and deaths in people who take medications long-term.

If it's having an adverse effect then yeah, it's way too risky to use stimulant meds.   


Also, the way my psychiatrist and GP described it to me is that the end goal is to wind down the usage and eventually, no longer need to use stimulant medication so frequently if at all. It's supposed to be a means of enabling us to build good habits and routines in our day to day to work with ADHD rather than against it. CBT is daunting and the meds help to stay on track with it until it becomes habitual.

Those changes in heart rate are so small they dont really matter, unless you already have a really fast beating heart.

ETA: Just read the article - I was moreso asking in reference to the link you mentioned between medication and likelihood of neurological disease later in life. I realize people with ADHD have a higher likelihood of these, but haven’t heard about medication having an affect on those outcomes.

It certainly tracks logically - that medication does affect those likelihoods longterm - but brains are funny so hopefully people are researching it now even if there isn’t anything published on it yet.

"Does adhd medications (specifically concerta, ritalin) shorten your life?",">Stimulants work by activating the ""fight or flight"" response in mammals. 

Does it? Why am I not in constant panic state while taking stimulants then? I'm so hypersensitive to any sign of anxiety in my body, that I'd instantly trigger my panic even more.

The neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine, that are either increased or the reuptake inhibited by medication, play a role in the relationship of the frontal lobe and the amygdala, which is responsible for the fight and flight response. The stimulants should balance that relationship, so stress should actually decrease."
"Does adhd medications (specifically concerta, ritalin) shorten your life?","Yeah I can't find it at the moment.

That doesn't say anything about if stimulant treatment will change the Alzheimers risk though. But they suggest in the discussion that since ADHD correlates with substance abuse, physical injury and low educational achievement, the added risk could come from ADHD related behaviors.

The sort of overarching conclusion i've come to when i started searching around is that low dose methylphenidate (concerta, ritalin, medikinet etc.) is absolutely safe long term, and even the higher doses seem to be so as well. Personally, my blood pressure is unaffected by the dose i'm on (which is on the lower end). In fact, long term it will probably lower it due to the secondary effect of being able to exercise more and eat less."
"Does adhd medications (specifically concerta, ritalin) shorten your life?","Barkley is only responsible for the 13 year figure as far as I know, there are countless papers on ADHD-adjacent health risks, they just don't make any statements on how much these comorbidities in total affect the overall lifespan.

Hasn't been the case for me at all. There are only 2 treatment options in my country (Concerta or Vyvanse). I was already trialled on every antidepressant they offer before I got diagnosed with ADHD.

I'm on the dose/med combo that works best out of the two (2!!)  med options available. After 5 months I hit tolerance, and it's never been the same, no matter how long the med holiday is. I'm a NEET with no life because I can't function long enough to complete any goal bigger than making sure my flat is habitable."
"Does adhd medications (specifically concerta, ritalin) shorten your life?","I would imagine the true reality is impossible to determine, hence why a causal factor cannot, and probably will not, ever be determined.

Your hunch would also be impossible to prove because there is no way to compare the results of both situations. If someone is medicated, you will never know how long they could have lived without it, and if unmedicated, you cannot know how long they would have lived if medicated.

So, say one with ADHD gets in some kind of accident due to being distracted. Well, did ADHD cause the accident? That’s pretty damn hard to discern. Every human is capable of being distracted, and distractions lead to all kinds of accidents. 

I would need to review the research again, but there are so many variables that can factor into an accident. Take driving for example, inclement weather, sleep deprivation, animals, substance use, mechanical issues, etc.. I highly doubt the research investigated the circumstances surrounding every single accident in their reviews involving a person with ADHD in an accident.

Rationally, it makes sense that ADHD => More Distractions and More Distractions => More accidents, but that does not mean ADHD = More accidents. 

Of course, this type of data is usually compared against other populations, but proving causality is still not possible.

For example, hot chocolate is drank more frequently in cold weather. There are more accidents in cold weather. But it would be weird (and incorrect) to say hot chocolate causes more accidents. It would correct to say there might be a positive correlation between hot chocolate and accidents in the winter."
"Does adhd medications (specifically concerta, ritalin) shorten your life?","im totally not against the medication. 

But it's simply no study if you can't measure things and that was done in the so claimed study that is now everywhere where it says that people with adhd die sooner, because they forget things or oversee things with their health. Thats just a strange claim.

Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"ADHD meds are a lifesaver for me! I personally take Adderall as Vyvanse gave me some pretty gnarly ticks. I've taken some med vacations in hopes to see if I can go at it alone, but always return. We gotta remember, ADHD is basically a disease of ""madness"". It really does hurt the user long term. It doesn't help that there's a stigma with amphetamines too.

Just remind yourself when life is being ghetto, of how much you've accomplished. How much more connected you are in your interpersonal relationships, how much better you take care of ""self"", etc. It's no miracle drug, but it's pretty than getting stuck in perpetual cycles of madness basically. 🫂"

Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"I actually take about 1-2 days off per week to give my brain a break. The Adderall is incredibly helpful with my focus, but I clench my teeth bad when I'm on it. Those 2 days a week have been my norm for about 3 years now. The lack of motivation does depend on the day I'm having, but I had to force myself to start meditating about 6 months ago. So if I'm overwhelmed or have no motivation on those 2 days, I force myself to stop and breathe for about 5 min. 
It's not a perfect system but it's worked so far."
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"Been taking adderal since 9. 

I’m 33. When I see people say they take a day off or skip a day….HOW???

Breaks? How? How do you take breaks? If I don’t take my MyDayis, I will feel like hades in Hercules switching between blue and red fire. 

It’s literally a chemical imbalance. You’re not giving your brain what it wants on those days off. 

I don’t understand.

Troopers the lot of you, I can’t I’m so dependent on that medication."

Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"I think any med you take every day for anything will get missed once in a while,  unless it's something like insulin that literally keeps you alive.  I always ask my patients or parents if they've missed any doses and if they can tell. The answer I hope to hear is ""OMG yes!"", because it means the stimulant is working as expected. "

I recommend adding in a pepcid every morning, especially during your luteal phase and period. Also, take a tums after you take your medication. It helps it last longer and i think it makes it stronger. 

Honestly hormones and things fluctuate so much, you're not going to feel amazing like the first time you take it. I have to exercise (walks, stretching) and drink caffeine in the afternoon to stay more regulated. I listen to a lot of music and i am trying to stay off tiktok bc it sucks me in and i get agitated and distracted.  
Start your day with achievements: make your bed. Go for a walk. Do a load of laundry. Little achievements help keep momentum..less distraction. 
I also have 2 kids so i have to get moving with certain things (keeping them alive) but otherwise, i get the vortex of distraction."

I got sick recently, and completely forgot about vit C making it less effective so I'd been practically chugging Sunny D as soon as I'd take my meds, which subsequently led to me forgetting to take my birth control and I think the hormones + me already being sick just basically put me back to square 1 and man, I took functioning-me for granted lmao."

Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"I’ve been on vyvanse for about a month now. Just diagnosed 43M. 

Today I was a bit late and considered skipping it. I decided instead to take a lower dose. My wife also has ADHD and takes 20mg, I take 30mg normally. 

In the time from when I took my dose and when it kicked in I missed 3 turns while driving. Forgot what we were actually doing out for a moment. 

It’s actually shocking how significant the differences is. I do wonder, am I worse off after missing a dose or is it just how things always used to be. I never realized how much of my executive function was put towards just not getting lost and thinking in circles. 

Btw, 20mg is pretty okay for me. I think I might go down once my current perscription is out."

Coworkers noticed within a couple days that I was more scatter brained and less focused than usual, and by the end of the week, it was to the point where I didn't feel safe driving home at the end of the day, because I couldn't focus on the road!

Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"Yeah Ive been where you are in the past many times. with the current ADHD medication im on which is to be taken twice a day for it to last throughout the entire day. I have a weekly schedule for the days I take my ADHD meds and its based on my school work and job. So every week i’ll take my meds Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and sometimes Sunday if I push off my weekly assignments to the last day. I dont take my meds on Monday’s, Tuesday’s, Saturday’s, and sometimes Sunday’s. I know taking days off can be rough but I firmly believe the pro’s out weigh the cons in the long run with taking stimulant meds. I notice with this schedule my meds feel more effective on a weekly basis because of the days I take off every week, it helps prevent tolerance buildup, so I havnt felt like I needed a higher dosage and another plus I have extra after every month which is helpful with the current shortage. Another thing I notice is on my days off I still feel capable of getting through my day.  Without feeling like im dragging a 500 pound weight everywhere, unmotivated, fatigued, depressed, similar to what OP described. Dependency is normal with every medication that is taken daily. its not a bad thing by any means when taken as prescribed. But after trying many different Adhd meds over the past 5 years while taking them 6 or 7 days every single week it did more harm to my overall mental health in the long run. I also consistently felt like my dosage was not high enough. That cycle repeated for a while until I set up that schedule for myself. 

Sorry about the length of my post, I just think its really important to educate people that even though ADHD meds are lifesaver’s for us they can sometimes cause a negative impact for one’s mental health if taken daily.

Edit: I realize This is topic varies in opinion from person to person. This is just my experience and how ive found the best results with my meds since being diagnosed  back in 2018"
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"I usually find that if you’ve been taking meds daily, the days following if you skip your doses, symptoms are exacerbated."
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"Reading everyone talking about dosage times is kinda crazy to me. I try to take my first dose of Vyvanse (30mg) at 9am… although sometimes it ends up being as late as 11am. Then my booster (10mg) I try to take around 6pm. Sometimes as late as 730pm. Previously I was on 1 dose (20mg daily) and found that even on the days I took it super late (like 1 pm because I had to be focused for work during the evening), I had no problems sleeping. And now I 50/50 take my booster as late as 730pm and fall asleep no problems at 11pm. It’s like my historically insomniac l, night owl brain says ‘you’re supposed to turn off and go to sleep, so turn off and go to sleep!”  And so it does. Interesting to hear everyone’s different experiences. But I’m left wondering; am I okay? Am I doing this right or is my right just very different?"
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"This might not be helpful or work for everyone but I feel like taking a break is kinda important from time to time. At least for me, to keep the dosage relatively low I took a break from my meds on weekends. That way, I can still stay in touch with my carefree spontaneous personality while taking it when I really need it. It helps maintain my tolerance too.

Someone here suggested taking half, I love that too.

However, ofc this works for me idk if it will work for anyone else like that."
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"Please do not forget that what goes up must come down! So when you take a day off after extended use, you aren't experiencing a baseline to compare it to. You're actually experiencing what is essentially the medication equivalent of a hangover. Withdrawal effects etc. Your body and mind adapt to expect the medication after a while. So when you don't get it you feel exhausted, emotional, depressed, temperamental, motivations are empty and even the smallest tasks feel like the worst thing in the world to have to try to do. 


I usually take a Sunday off to keep the efficacy of my meds up. On that day I fully expect to be knackered, wiped out and plan to be a vegetable accordingly."

Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"I wish I had that comparison to when I take a day break from the meds to how I am when taking them as usual. I've been on Concerta 27mg for about 3 months and have really just been feeling diminishing returns but my doctor just interprets it as if I'm not trying hard enough and refuses to increase it or offer any other help because she's worried about tolerance and capping it too soon. 

I don't have side effects, my appetite feels fine and I don't feel when it kicks in as I don't feel too much different, everything feels like pulling teeth, my social anxiety at work makes talking and feeling comfortable hard and decision paralysis/executive dysfunction are the worst. 

I'm really glad you have that clarity to know your meds are working and your new normal has been going really well for you that you notice such a huge difference on days you don't take your dose!! I'm sorry I didn't mean to ramble on about myself that much tho!!"
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"Yeah it was great for me until I got a higher tolerance.

Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"This is why I HATE people who treat us like addicts.

Meanwhile on my off days where I don’t take it, just cleaning my apartment is a monumental task that I have to fight to not get distracted from. I’ve found myself turning on a show and then just standing there watching it rather than cleaning many times"
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"My doc reccomends taking a day off once a week. Im told it's more about not building up tolerance so my dosage remains effective. 

I can't say I abide that EVERY week, but I try. I'm basically useless that day. Sometimes I just don't have the time in my schedule to spend an entire day doing nothing, but I try to make room for it. I just think of it as a rest day. I sit around with my husband, watch movies all day and nap. Maybe go for a walk, but mostly i dont expect much from myself that day. It's not ideal, but this is the hand I was dealt. If I was diabetic I wouldn't be able to eat that slice of cake. If I had kidney disease I would have to spend time on dialysis. As far as health issues go.. having to do a lazy TV day a few times a month as part of the management of my ADHD is not too bad.

I also think the bounce back after regularly being on meds is tougher BECAUSE you're body is adjusted to them. I DEFINITELY struggle without my meds, but I'm not sure it's fair to compare myself one day off of meds to my medicated self. 

A fairer comparison would be me 2-3 weeks off of meds vs. medicated. 2 weeks off of meds I'm scatter brained, unfocused, procrastinating, fidgety, it takes me forever do things because i get distracted, etc. But I'm not sluggish the way I am the first day off. Part of my unmedicated symptoms are that my thoughts jump around... a lot. I can't shut my brain off. My thoughts are always going a mile a minute to the point where I can't sleep because I can't stop thinking. It's exhausting. First day off of meds I don't have that problem. If anything, my brain is slower. 2-3 weeks of the meds and that shit is back in full force."
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"It’s very possible you’re experiencing symptoms of amphetamine withdrawal.  

Yes, your ADHD symptoms are probably more noticeable to you in contrast now that you’ve been medicated, but I don’t think it’s fair to yourself to go one day without medication and say wow I was such a mess before.  When I take an extended break, it takes at least a week before I level out and feel like my brain has taken the reigns on its own serotonin production.  

I’m only saying this because I personally have taken breaks off my meds for various reasons, and the first few days were the absolute hardest."
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"YUP. I was on a high dose of strattera for a couple years (diagnosed at 34), which is a nonstimulant and builds up in your system slowly so even if you missed a day, yeah you’d be a little off your game but wasn’t night and day.

I switched to vyvanse a few months ago. Amazing experience so far, but last week I was waiting on a delayed refill and so I skipped a couple days to try and save my last ones for my busiest workdays. I literally told my husband in tears that I’m so proud of myself for everything I’ve done so far in my life because being able to see what I’m like at 0 meds back to back with a day of correct meds was shocking. I don’t know how I did ANYTHING before meds.  It was actually a refreshing change from how I normally look back at the past, where I’m having to remind myself that the feelings of failure and frustration were wrong and I was just undiagnosed and doing my best."
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"I take a break from my medication once a month, and while I find it necessary, I DREAD those days!

I lose/ forget things, miss turns and exits when driving, forget what I’m doing half the time, it’s crazy! Once I got on my medication my life got so much better (and I was able to stay clean/ sober). I always felt like EVERYTHING was hard, and I would just have to work 10x harder than everyone else just to keep up! So I can totally relate, I’m glad you got the support you needed too!

It took a couple hours of being awake, but Jfc I didn’t realize how fast my brain goes, I was so accustomed to it. After quieting my brain for several weeks in a row, it was a clusterfuck.

Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"Took me a long time to see how ridiculous it was for me to feel guilty for needing a consistent neurochemical aid for a neurochemical deficit — daily, and not feel ashamed or surprised that if I do take a break and change that balance I’m going to be glitchy. unless I wake up late, I generally have accepted that daily consistent timed dosing works best. 

But for the need of an emergency stash and tolerance breaks, I’ve decided 
1) to embrace the glitch at the same time as my worst PMS days so one decoys the other so I’m less hyper focused on either which at first I thought I must be psycho but turned out surprisingly a win
2) taking half capsules on 2 days (consecutive or not) is less glitchy for me overall than completely skipping 1 day. I notice if I skip completely for 1-2days , it takes me at least the 2nd or 3rd day of resuming to mentally get back to the “drivers seat”. 
3) tolerance breaks are good, mostly bc we can’t rely on the supply the same way as say with blood pressure meds, but also spiritually it’s an opportunity to take a humble break 
4) to gamify tolerance breaks by willing myself to do the “easiest” things, like waking up and go straight out around the block for a walk bc if I hesitate for a second I won’t know what to change into/ if I should eat breakfast/which morning/hygiene routine to do first.  Or like 10 jumping jacks before resuming doomscrollthousandyardstare. And my recent favorite, weeding in the backyard. I’ll get sidetracked to other garden tasks for sure but then weeds are so conveniently just there and everywhere to sidetrack me back, the nice thing is the garden looks surprisingly great when I resume dose and have the attention to appreciate it as a whole."

Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"I skip when I want to have a lazy day with nothing planned to just rest. I literally just intentionally lie in bed, watch cartoons, eat snacks and maybe go for a walk. 

I feel like embracing the dysfunction every now and then helps me idk."
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"There can also be a bit of withdrawal when you stop taking Vyvanse and other stimulant medication after a long period. You may feel particularly off today due to that. However, doesn’t mean that the meds aren’t working, I’m sure they are."
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,I skip mine quite often because I am also autistic and I am more fun without medication haha
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,I'm on 70mg vyvanse and I am the same way. Can't function at work or in life in general without it.
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"When I did my psychological testing for Autism/ADHD/Bipolar, the provider asked that I stop taking my Vyvanse for as long as my psychiatrist would approve leading up to the test. My psychiatrist said “No more than two days because you become extremely destabilized without it” to which I scoffed….. boy was she right. Day one without it and I wanted to sink into the earth."
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,Yeah it is important to note that if you take any sort of ADHD med for 6 weeks and then skip a day you will definitely feel crappy. Not saying that at all to try and give you or anyone else any crap for taking ADHD meds. I literally take my Adderall daily. 
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"Just remember, that isn’t your baseline. You’re experiencing rebound effects which worsen symptoms below baseline. So while your unmedicated self has symptoms, right now it’s amplified."
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"Vyvanse is a great med for adhd , motivation and depression. It can't be snorted and it is safer somehow because you have to swallow it.  It is still addictive and more as you state, I started with 50mg and had a great 2 years... It is worth it, but off is exactly as you state. When ut drops , u can ger as depressed as hell.. I take am 40 and pm 30
.... Still after 15 years...amd switching some because of tolerance... my doct. Adding in ir dex.. am and late day( he just retired and new APRN MENTAL nurse... won't give me any dex. So it is HARD... I will tell u that maybe a few years after I built tolerance and ran out or couldn't fill.. I was VERy depressed like u.... horrible... I take breaks now... It isn't as bad after 3 or 4 days and drink caffine... Try to do something. But it is scary.. I am dependent on it and wish I wasnt.."
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,I take a day off when I know I can take a rest day and have nothing to do. Taking at least one day off helps me sleep better.

Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"I was recently started on 20 mg of Vyvanse, and while I know that it's made a positive difference, I'm pretty sure I need to be titrated up to a higher dose. My behaviors like impulsivity have improved somewhat, and I'm not as irritable and argumentative as I used to be, but I still have a lot of difficulty focusing and getting started with important tasks and projects. At the moment, I'm attempting to write a paper for school, and I think I've written two paragraphs in the past two hours. 🙄 Oh, and here I am on Reddit, too, so... LOL 

(Honestly, I desperately needed a break, and I'll get right back to it. The assignment isn't due until 11:59 pm tonight and it's 4:15 EST right now. Please send good vibes.)

I’ve had to come off them because combined with the Citalopram I’m on my blood pressure was too high. Was gutted when my BP dropped after stopping, because that means I’ve got to stay off it. I’ve not been the same since because it’s completely life changing. 

Trying a different type of medication soon, but if it doesn’t have the same benefits, I’m going to come off my Citalopram and ask if I can try Vyvanse again. Glad it’s had such a positive effect for you."
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"I've been on a break for a few days from my Ritalin because I got my dosage raised and the pharmacy is having issues with stock but wow the amount of help I get from that medication makes me thankful I have a script.

I have been forgetting all kinds of stuff and stuff like keeping on track with groceries and such is all out the window until tomorrow or so when I can get the refill."
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"Yeah, the other day I had a pretty eventful morning and I completely realized by about 3/4 in the afternoon that I had forgotten to take my adderall. It was honestly a really shitty day due to it. I was super tired the entire day and I was also very irritable, emotional, and just didn't feel 100% there mentally. When I realized I honestly laughed to myself and tried to see it as something good. My husband and I plan on trying for a baby next year and I plan on taking a few days off here and there with my meds to get used to taking no medication during pregnancy."

Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"For me it depends, there are some days I don't take it as a way to force myself to take a break and not burn myself out.

But yeah, the first couple times you stop taking Vyvanse, yeah it hits you pretty hard. After a while though (at least for me) it isn't to bad and it's manageable, though I am alot less productive"
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"Glad you were able to find a med that works for you!  Dosage is a slippery slope. I think the general idea which I haven’t seen here, is finding the minimum dose that makes things better.

Once you are adjusted to a dose, you won’t feel as “great” as you did in the beginning. I think this is where people search for a higher dose.  Without knowing it, I think a lot of people are “chasing a high.”"
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"I take dexadrin and have since I was a kid. I’m 35 now and had always taken the weekends off unless I planned on getting a lot done. I’m more social and less irritable without it so it’s nice to have a break. 

That being said… I’m currently 37 weeks pregnant so I haven’t been able to take it since February when I found out. It’s been soooo hard to get things done. My hospital bag isn’t ready. My laundry is in a constant pile. Haven’t written my thank you cards for my shower from August and the house is a mess. Needless to say I can’t wait until I’m done breastfeeding and can get back on my meds. It’s been rough without them. You can really tell how much they affect your daily life when you have to stop taking them."
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,I just started Vyvanse yesterday and this reassuring in the sense that I'm glad it's such a wonderful drug for so many people. I was so hesitant but it made me feel great! I don't have a TON of energy but I just feel calm. I'm hoping it's the key that unlocks some potential that I've been feeling like ADHD has been preventing.
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,What were some of the side effects you were experiencing with the others meds?
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"It’s just a whole new world isn’t it? I have not missed a dose, the dread I feel in the morning before I do take my medication is very much enough of a reminder. I wouldn’t rush into adjusting your dose. The effect might vary, just like our symptoms do. Sleep, food, stress, workload etc all have an impact. And for females the monthly hormonal cycle often makes a huge difference in how well the meds work. Last couple weeks of my cycle I often function significantly worse. Some people take a slightly higher dose in this time. Hope it keeps working well for you!"
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,Does anyone have any experience switching from Adderall to Vyvanse? I’ve been on 40mg Adderall for years (late onset adult adhd) and feeling like it’s not doing it anymore but I don’t know if I want to bump the dosage up so was considering Vyvanse.
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"No words can describe how much Venvanse (the Brazilian name for it) has changed my life. I'm working as a salesperson for very complex engineering equipment, and my life is full of schedules now. A few weeks ago a colleague complimented my punctuality. I'm a punctual person. This says so much... 
On my days off I take Ritalin so it won't impair my appetite, and it's just not the same."
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"Funny story!!!

Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"There is also a rebound effect that kinda happens when you’ve been taking it for a very long time and then stop suddenly! So like personally I’d suggest, if ur not already, skipping it 2-3 days out of the week you aren’t too busy :)"

Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,I was also recently diagnosed at 50 and started Foquest a few weeks ago…felt very shaky and didn’t feel a positive difference at all.  Then went I went up in dose I had a bad headache every single day so my doc switched me to vyvance.  Took my first dose today and zero side effects and I feel slightly different.  I’m curious to see the difference when I actually have to work…and when I go up in dose in a couple weeks.
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"It's so strange to me how medication works sometimes. Vyvanse was one of the few I tried that didn't work for me. 

I started with concerta which worked great... but it gave me heart palpitations as a side effect.

Vyvance was second, and it didn't work for me whatsoever. Like, it made my mental health worse. I went into a depression spiral and had to stop taking it.

I'm now using one called Foquest, and things are feeling great."
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"I’ve taken weeks and even a month or more off over the years that I’ve been taking it. I didn’t like it. Some of them were because I simply couldn’t get the prescription filled. Others were because it wasn’t doing for me what it used to and I wanted to reset a bit. I fell back into old thoughts and habits but not completely. 

The one thing that never happened even after 5 years of taking it daily without a break was any kind of withdrawal. I was not addicted it was just helpful and without it I didn’t do as well. I’d have been in the er and checked into detox if what they say about it is true. So yes :)"
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"I so wish I could feel this way about my own Vyvanse, or really any ADHD medication, but I just had the same realization with my anxiety medication and by gods it’s so incredible to realize your meds working, and they’re working so well.

Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"It’s such a relief to see so many people saying they can’t stand taking a day off, I’ve tried taking a break (and was recently forced to by insurance/supply chain issues), and every time I feel absolutely terrible. The biggest difference meds have made for me is emotional regulation, so without them the smallest inconvenience becomes a catastrophe."
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"Not vyvanse, but my dose of strattera was originally 2 pills and I've been taking my 1 pill a day with relative success compared to the other prescriptions. It's such a relief finding a treatment that works."
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"I have also just started on Vyvanse- I did two weeks on 20mg and have now been on 30mg for a week.

I'm having a weird time- 20mg took away my appetite (ideal, I'm also treating BED) and made focusing on a task easier- but didn't do anything to help the executive paralysis or decision paralysis.

On 30mg I'm now all over the place. My appetite is back and I'm super spacey, forgetful, running later than I ever was and have brain fog and decision paralysis almost worse.

Anyone else experience this? Will going up to 40mg head in the right direction again? (I won't until I see my doctor, don't worry). I kind of had this with my antidepressants once; the starting dose gave me an inkling of good things, the next step was horrendous and then the next titration was helpful again. I figure it could also be time based."

Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"Currently taking an involuntary break from Vyvanse 30 for the second time within two months (prescription issues after moving countries) and I definitely feel the same way - I get stuck in task planning and I'm extremely fatigued. I do not recall it being that bad before Vyvanse, but my perspective may have shifted since taking it (have been for about a year). From what I could find online, part of it may be exacerbated by the body's withdrawal reaction, too, which can last up to two weeks. Not keen on going that long without it (it's been one week so far) but if i have to and find out if it gets better after that, I'll let you know 😅"
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,This happens to me too! Originally I tried to take breaks on weekends but I would just have SUCH bad days. I realized the breaks weren't worth it because they made me so sad & I also wasn't actually getting recharged for the week.

Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"Vyvanse saved me, when I miss a day I really see how much worse my life is without it, I know it's not the right choice for everyone but for me it's been amazing, I don't notice any side effects either

Also important to note, I had to gradually increase my dose all the way up to 70mg, as prescribed by my psychiatrist"
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"Hey, I'm on Elvanse here in the UK. It's the same as Vyvanse. 70mg seems to do the trick. Yes I know. Very high but it's the only thing that works. No side effects and wears off after 10-12hrs. 

Days off DO GET EASIER I promise. The first time I took a day off was terrible and I wanted to cry. But take a day off when you actually have nothing to do. Relax if you can. Communicate with your partner and let them or other family know you're taking a day off. Really just relax and eat and meditate. It gets so much easier by the third time of taking a day off. My Dr suggested even try one day on one day off. 

Hope that helps!! Think positive guys! The mindset is EVERYTHING in life!!"
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"When I first started my med there were a couple of times that I forgot to take it before work. The realization would hit once I noticed the usual issues starting. A couple of other times I intentionally skipped it just to see. Yep. Still need it. 


Even after being on my meds for two years now, it can still be easy to forget it. Those rare occasions act as reminders that even if it doesn't always seem like it's working, it is.


That said, I used to take a day off every week. No problems. It's my one day to be useless, leave me alone lol. Don't really have that luxury anymore. Just recently I was so exhausted and apathetic from everything that I nearly missed the deadline for picking up my antidepressant. So don't neglect taking care of yourself and resting."

I started vyvanse about 2-3 years ago when I was 22.

I always took breaks sometimes for multiple weeks, 
but everytime I took the vyvanse-breaks, I had pretty much the exact same ADHD symptoms that you are describing coming back.

It's so subtle yet so present...

Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"So I was on Adderall XR for years. Switched when Adderall wasn’t available to Vyvanse. Let me tell you, Vyvanse is the shit. It definitely is a med that for me I have to take daily. If I don’t, it’s awful. I’m thinking I may need to increase to 30mg currently on 20mg. Initially when I first increased to 30mg it was hell, but I’ve learned, I need to eat or drink something with protein around lunch time to stave off any side effects. I would get horrible anxiety when it start to wear off, but unlike before when I first tried I wasn’t on Ozempic. I now am and my meds last longer now that I’m on Ozempic (I’m a fast metabolizer of stimulants) and Oz seems to slow down how fast I metabolize medications which is great on my end. I know there’s a few other ADHD people on GLP meds who say the same thing which is great but not so great for people who don’t need GLP meds because that shit works."

Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"I took Vyvanse for 15 years. The way you feel when you don’t take it is an extremely exaggerated version of what normality feels like.

I’ve been off Vyvanse / stimulants for 4 years now and I can now work completely fine. Getting off though was a huge struggle. HUGE. I was really addicted.

You described needing a higher dose already. That is what happens. You slowly need more. By the end I was on 60mg twice per day (!!) and I thought it was completely normal. I freaking loved it at the time. But it came with a huge cost. I was hyper productive, unable to chill, obsessed with getting things done.

Eventually I went into psychosis after trying to ween off, but then going back to my original dose because I was craving it so bad. After battling mania/psychosis for a few months, I finally kicked the habit and now I’m clean and I love it.

Life without vyvanse has been revolutionary for me. No, I’m not hyper productive, but I can still get locked in and get things done.

TL:DR; I’m typing this because I don’t want to see others become addicted to Vyvanse like I was. It feels amazing but it comes with a large cost down the road. It is making your ADHD baseline worse when you are not on the Vyvanse, as you found with your day off.

I’m happy to have a conversation with you about this."

Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"Vyvanse is by far the best med for me as well. It’s not perfect, but what medication is, right? It’s a double edged sword and I like the idea of cycling off or taking days off. The issue with a one or even a few day break is that I am below below baseline, so I’m feeling worse than I would if I was off it for a long period of time, say a week or two. But I can’t afford more than a day here and there and that only works if I truly have nothing important to do. And I have wife, kids, job, house, so that pretty much never happens. The few times it has worked out I was kinda useless but I did feel more rested the next day."

Point is there’s absolutely no judgement here but wanted you tk be aware of the other side of the coin. It’s definitely working but try to fight that unmotivated, unfocused tendencies and take more days off to prove to yourself that even though it may be helping, you can still power through on your own if necessary."

In my experience skipping vyvanse sucks, i dont feel like doing much, kind of feels like a mild hangover that lasts a couple days. Now when I went off adderall, well that was a different story for me. Crippling anxiety and fear of un reasonable things happening. Lingering feeling of doom and dread on top of feeling generally miserable. All new things to me. I do not have anxiety and am generally not a fearful person. This is leaving out the actual side effects of getting insatiable hunger and unlike me anger in the evenings when on it. I went through that and then asked to switch to vyvanse and give it a try. Way better, generally well tolerated besides it spikes my blood pressure early in the day."

I do hope that Portugal pursue subsidising your medication further.

I'm in Spain on 50mg. Here it is free... When I had a lower dose, it was €30 per bottle. I nearly fell over when i filled my first prescription at 50mg and she told me I disn't have to pay!

I'm Australian. Back home, just visiting my GP cost $30 a time. Speaking to them or psychologists led to a brick wall where ADHD was dismissed without much explanation. Here, my GP (free to visit) suggested pursuing the diagnosis after a short chat prompted. I did not raise the subject myself.

I do not know how representative my experience is, but I am loving Spain!"

I definitely realize when I didn't take it and my day is ruined.  I've had some serious consequences (like major injuries) when I'm off it.. but I also don't want my heart to explode.

I'm on the Xelstrym patch and Guanfacine for my ADHD. I'm 36 now, but was diagnosed a little more than 11 years ago, but I didn't choose to be medicated until May of this year. I woke up one Sunday morning about 4 or 5 weeks ago and decided to not take anything that morning because I wanted a break. I was awake for three days, sleeping for MAYBE about an hour and a half each night, not falling asleep until about 5am and then waking up for work at 6:15am. It was fucking horrible, my anxiety was through the roof and I was so damn tired. I will never purposely skip a dose ever again."
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"It is likely that it’s so hard because you’ve been taking it so long.  You then experience amphetemine withdrawal.  At some point you may want to consider taking an extended break to see the other side.  Doing 1 day does not give you the perspective.  Yeah I know, seems impossible right?  You’d have to do it when you didn’t have any things you needed to do.  I’d say on holiday, but you don’t want to feel shit on holiday.
Why do it?  You have way more experience with it than me, but I find that switching states once in a while makes me get more insight into which parts of me are me/adhd/drug"
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"I take breaks because I build tolerance pretty quickly. It's also to remind myself what being unmedicated feels like. I take those breaks on weekends usually, and often slip in Mondays of Fridays. It's part of my routine now. Vyvanse/Adderall train me very well behavior-wise. If I spent a few days in my perfect routine while on meds, I'll autopilot through the days I'm not on meds. 

Funny thing, my 1st doctor told me NOT TO DO IT. But I've started doing it anyway. So I was told to find another doc because I don't follow their restricted drug protocol lol (I was taking less than prescribed, sure I have a problem)...  
My family doc agreed to take over and she's happy to see me taking breaks. She has a brother with adhd so she's aware of how all that crap works."
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"To be fair, breaks are easier to take the more you take them. If you have taken it everyday for a long time the withdrawal on a day off is going to be brutal, whereas if you're someone who can manage a day or two off per week, it won't be as bad.

NOT that I'm saying someone shouldn't take it everyday if that's what they need. Just pointing out why some people can take breaks without feeling like complete hell, and that it's not an inherently bad thing to do :)"
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"You do understand that Vynanse is literally just amphetamines, right?

It’s a chemical imbalance, sure, but amphetamines aren’t balancing your brain chemistry. It’s brute forcing yourself to move past the imbalance. Not undoing it. I don’t think I could go back to life without them, seeing what they do for me personally but not everyone’s ADHD is the same. In fact there is a very broad spectrum.

Personally I like having off days

You also can build a tolerance up quite quickly so breaks are recommended. There are long term costs on not just your brain but other organs when you take stimulants like amphetamines every day. Especially if you have other medications going too."
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,Yeah that’s what happens when you prescribe a 9yo speed because he doesn’t wanna sit still in class for 8hrs a day. Broken system making ppl dependent on amohetamine to function normally. I feel bad for your nervous system

Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,Adderall XR raised my BP a bit and gave me headaches daily. Anxiety was super elevated. I would focus on how I was feeling and it was awful. The IR was even worse. Almost an instant migraine. Concerta didn't do anything but make me tired. Went though 2 dose changes with that. Ritalin made me feel incredibly anxious.

She said she read a book where someone learned ways to 'overcome' their ADHD with coping skills. I said, if I have diabetes should I just find coping skills to manage instead of insulin? I've taught my kids from an early age that the brain should have no greater stigma than your other organs. It aggravates me to no end."
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"It is, but it works differently than other extended release stimulants. It does take about an hour and a half to two hours to kick in, but it's much smoother than Adderall. I don't experience a crash with it. I know it's wearing off because the music starts playing in my head again. My daughter, who is 23, was also on Adderall. She lost 7 pounds in a month, which she cannot afford, so they switched her to Vyvanse as her last option with stimulants. It's working great for her at just 10mg, and she has her appetite back."
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"Yes, it is a stimulant. For what it's worth, when I first took Adderall and Vyvanse I had similar side effects and then after like two weeks the side effects either became like a lottt weaker or completely disappeared. I rarely get headaches, never got blurred visions though, and it hardly affects my appetite anymore. I used to get really tired when it wore off but that doesn't happen anymore at all. I found that taking it on the weekends when I didn't work was still helpful like spending less money when I shopped, less mistakes when driving, and a better listener when my partner talked to me. The only reason I don't take it on the weekends now is bc after a little under two years I learned I quickly develop a tolerance and the highest dose did nothing. My work performance suffered a lot and then my mental health crumbled bc of it and I had to take a very long medical leave/drug vacation. That's not the case for everyone. Some ppl take it years and years and barely develop a tolerance if at all. If that were the case for me I'd definitely take it on the weekend bc ADHD affects every part of your life, not just school or work. I remember crying when I realized how much easier reading for fun was when I took ADHD. When I tried to do it without meds for the first time I felt so dumb and that's when I cried. Anyway, maybe that helps?"
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,I'm so grateful for them too. These meds have changed my life in so many positive ways.

I'm the only one diagnosed in my immediate family, and I really think I've made this all up or something bc I did well in school, and finished college. What they didn't see was my anxiety, how hard it was to study and complete work, my procrastination for every assignment, and my insecurity around others. I never felt good enough, like I was an imposter. I've always felt like I just lucked out, and never truly earned anything on my own merit. Having these meds make me realize I am capable, and I'm starting to get more confident. It's gonna take a bit though, undoing years of negative self thoughts."

Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"I took it!
Yeah vyvanse literally changed my life! I usually don’t take it on weekends and just let myself have that break (also I just usually sleep to late to take it on weekends)
I was on vacation once and wasn’t taking it because vacation, and I felt so cruddy and didn’t know why. I had zoom therapy one morning and told my therapist how I was feeling, and she asked if I was taking my vyvanse. I told her no and then she suggested that I try taking it that day and see if it made a difference. BOY did it make a difference!!! Now I take it every day that I have anything to do lol"
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"It might be worth mentioning to your doc. I had incredible anxiety on Adderall, but it did help quiet my brain. The vyvanse is my silent little worker bee. It's there doing what it has to, but I'm not aware unless I think about it."
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"Would love to hear more input… bc it really changes people whether we have ADD or not sure when I first started taking Vyvanse. It was great, but I find speaking for myself and multiple other people how it just changes your personality and usually not the best way overtime not to mention that dependence on it physically…I definitely think there is good and bad with it, but it’s also different since the shortage. I really find that there are days where it works and some days where it’s like I haven’t taken it at all."
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,Oooof this….. mine is severe almost narcolepsy.. no but really it’s bad…. And so many people have been prescribed it now whether it’s for ADD or not especially after Covid I’ve learned after talking with my doctor and a few other doctors not to mention how it’s always out of stock at multiple pharmacies where I live. It’s kind of scary.
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,I had the same advice. I’m ADHD and bipolar. But I was told to take my adderall everyday. It’s not just helpful for school/work. We need this in everyday life for everyday things.
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"Hi there, what dose are you on? I've been on 20mg for about 6 years now and have definitely built a tolerance to it."
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,Do you exercise at all?
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"Your story sounds similar to mine. I started at 20mg, and it helped remove the music from my head. The focus wasn't improved. I was still fading out during conversations, and interrupting people when they talked. The 30 definitely helped a lot. It's all about finding that sweet spot.

Sending good vibes on your paper! I remember working my way thru college unmedicated. I set small chunks of time to work, with small breaks in between. Alarms are your friend for that. Then I'd reward myself with something that night if I finished. You can do it!"
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,I'm so sorry. I hate that we can't function properly if we don't have access to insurance. We can't help the way our brains are wired.
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"Think of Vyvanse as the extract of adderall. Everything adderall is and does for you intensified a bit, but without the controlled substance aspects of it. I myself did love it, but what I didn’t love was my irritability levels when it would wear off for the day. Went back to adderall xrs and now I’m on a 2 week break from that, since I started to feel numb from it. 

I still feel Vyvanse > adderall (in any form) for legitimate adhd"
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"I felt more anxious. And I focused on that anxiety and not much else. Also, when the later dose in the XR hit, I'd get a headache. The IR was even worse. I was too focused on how I felt, I couldn't do anything. I tried it for 3 weeks. Then I tried concerta. I wanted to sleep all day and it didn't help my symptoms. Ritalin didn't do a thing.

Vyvanse just clears it all up without me being aware, if that makes sense. It's just easier and it's not my focus."
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"I have high blood pressure, which was a concern. I'm actually on two meds for it. Luckily Vyvanse hasn't altered it at all. I hope you find something that works for you soon. It must be awful finding something and then having to go off of it"
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"It is wild! I am extra thankful for these meds, and that I have access to them."

Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,That's good to know!
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,I think you're right. And I did read that info on this sub reddit. Which is super helpful since this is my first time on meds. I'm wary to change it if I don't have to.
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,I feel like it will. Just give it time! You eventually just do things without thinking about it. Which is huge for me!
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"Adderall raised my BP a bit, and gave me headaches every single day. Made me super anxious and aware I was on meds. Concerta made me soooo tired. Even with a dose increase I was exhausted. It also didn't help one single symptom. Ritalin was terrible. Didn't do anything and also made me anxious with a headache. Vyvanse is just smooth. I don't even realize I'm on meds. Things are just easier. I dont know how else to describe it. Less effort and more output."
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"I think this was the reminder I needed that my dose is fine, and it's just my new normal. I don't want to go higher if I don't need to. I also don't have to worry about cycles as I'm on hormone replacement therapy, but I do notice if I'm not eating enough protein, it's not quite as effective. I'm so glad it works for you! I am loving my new world honestly!"
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"My daughter went from Adderall to vyvanse and had zero issues. Adderall made her lose too much weight, so vyvanse was her last try before they pulled stims from her. She said it works great and is also eating normal."

Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"In Australia at least it's in the information sheet that comes with the bottle how to do it. Just fill a measuring cup with the same amount of milliliters as the amount of milligrams of the capsule, then open the capsule and pour all the powder in. Then mix it and take out whatever milliliters you want the dose to be. E.g. if you have 70mg capsules and want a 50mg dose, mix the powder with 70mls of water and then take out 50mls and drink that. This advice was given to a lot of people here during the shortage of Vyvanse because the 70mg was still available, so they'd be prescribed the 70mg and then take whatever dosage they needed using the water dilution method."
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"The generic is a fine powder, it's not especially easy to divide accurately, but I can do it ok with some practice, but the small capsules halves can be fiddly and I've dropped them, spilled the powder etc. It has a mild and not unpleasant taste, so just dropping half a capsule 's powder in my mouth isn't unpleasant. I've I was told the name brand Vyvanse is now some kind of gell beads and can't/isn't easy to divide??

Anyways, always best to consult with your prescribing professional about any dosing changes, etc. But being a controlled substance sometimes it seems they just have to reiterate the guidelines they are told they have to. In the US they will not prescribe be two on the same pill each day, was told that was against DEA rules. In Canada they are happy to prescribe me two pills that add up to my daily dose so halving my dose is no bother at all. So, use common sense, etc..."

I haven't had that after having a break for a few days though.

So that's something to keep in mind."
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"I don't think so. Lisdexamfetamine (the generic drug in name brand Vyvanse is a somewhat slow release inherently because it's a ""prodrug"" and your body has to break off the lysine molecule attached to the lisdexamfetamine molecule to release the amphetamine molecule and that takes place over time. I believe the gel beads in name brand Vyvanse as described to me, never seen it with my own eyes are for additional slow release. Which I worry would be too slow? I need to take any lisdexamfetamine I take in a day first thing in the morning or getting to sleep can be quite problematic. And the effects are slow enough to kick in as it is, if not for a strong espresso first thing in the morning I'd be useless for hours waiting for the lisdexamfetamine to kick in enough."

Ever since the generic came out, the name brand went up to $180 instead of $100. So every month I’m paying $180 unless they have the generic in which case it’s only $10.

Same goes for any medical expense, state will always cover most of it.

I am yet to meet a single person in Australia who thinks this to be a good idea who was not either a card-carrying member of the Liberal Party (equivalent-ish to Republicans or UK Conservatives), exceedingly wealthy, or both. 

Universal coverage is popular, very popular. Private health insurance seems almost universally viewed as needed to deal with problems in the public system attributed to underfunding and political neglect.

I now live in Spain. The process of being diagnosed was surprisingly quick and was free. Although i previously paid for my ADHD meds, my now higher dosage is free. When I dislocated my shoulder I recieved frequent physiotherapy, various tests and medical appointments and it was all free and without excessive wait lists.

I now function better and have (almost) full rotation back in my (now) pain-free shoulder and none of it cost a cent. This is what my parents remember of the Australian system when they were younger. I'm loving Spain for this.

People say I'm lucky and there are positives working at home and negatives. I have worked my job going on 27 yrs so half my life with coworkers is what I miss most from office. Never thought I'd need medicine to function but here I am and I will say that the vyvanse is working awesome for my focus to work. I obviously love my job or I would not still be working here and being at home I'm not hopeless or sad just lost my motivation and medicine has changed that. The only thing I notice is mild heartburn but I will ask Dr about that as it's never been issue for me except during pregnancy 28yrs ago. Not sure if there are concerns with heartburn and taking vyvanse any comments on that would be appreciated.

Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,No NHS?
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"it is not perfect, but in comparison to some other countries, it is perfect. if you don't have insurance, the government still pays like 50%-80% of the full price of the medicine and you can have free general appointments and exams.

private health care can be expensive, of course, but most companies provide health insurance after 6 months and everything becomes way cheaper. 

for example, a MRI here would cost 200-300€, but with insurance I only pay 20% of the total amount, which would be 60€ max."
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"Yes, I'm kinda shocked with the disparity in prices of the same medication in different countries. From 4€ to 300USD, what the hell is happening?

We can try a 100 different routines, tips, reading books, go to a therapist, but if we don't have the bare minimum to function, which for the majority of us would be the medication, everything else falls apart.

It is definitely something worth of a discussion."

I'm really the same person just less hyper. The meds do flatten my emotions a bit, but I need that since I'm the hyperactive type, but never where I'm a zombie. 

It's sad cuz I read a lot of stories where ADHD meds rob someone of their personality. I'd def recommend trying Wellbutrin possibly. It's a softer stimulant than amphetamine."

Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"I’ve been on Vyvanse since 2009 and I take it every single day. I started at 40mg and went up 10mg every few years to the max dose of 70mg. Then after a couple more years I broke my 70 mg down into a 40 mg Vyvanse in the morning and a 30 mg Vyvanse in the afternoon because I felt like it was wearing off too early. Then I had to switch health insurance and they didn’t like two Vyvanse doses so I’m currently on 50mg Vyvanse in the morning and 20mg Adderall IR in the afternoon, which is working well.

15 years vyvanse-strong with zero tolerance breaks over here."
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"Never taken a break. Started at 30mg, moved up to 50mg after ~6mo because it was wearing off too quick, and been on 40mg ever since.

Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"I understand the concern but this is a huge reason why its important to see the doctor and have EKG done every year. There's a good reason some doctors like to have monthly appointments for these medications. If you have any problems or concerns you discuss those issues with your psychiatrist and/or GP.

Personally I'm likely to take this med for life since my ADHD is severe enough to the point where I'm a literal potato without it. For me the benefits significantly outweigh the risks. Long as I'm financially able to afford treatment and there are no health issues I'm going to continue taking it.

But when I start to take the meds again after the break it's usually fantastic again. Can you make any sense of that or do you have an idea what I could do/take to not have to take those breaks? It's not an issue of dosing too high as far as I can tell, I was only taking 15mg of Vyvanse for the most part.

Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"Honestly, as much as I joked in reply to the other Aussie who commented, American health care is in the fucking toilet.

I feel like at some point our government HAS to wake up and realize our current system of health care is unsustainable. 

More than 65% of individual bankruptcies in America are due to medical bills.  That’s unconscionable! 

But big pharma lines the pockets of politicians which keeps health care costs high and I think is at least in part what keeps us from a single payer system.  

I mean, yes, I was being a bit silly when I commented about the U.S. being the only developed country without some sort of universal coverage, but it’s true!  Every single other fucking developed nation in the world has some sort of medical system in place that covers everyone!

Fuck, if we taxed Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk the way they SHOULD be taxed, we could probably pay for it from that alone!

And before anyone gives me this bullshit of the U.S. has too many people, China (while technically still considered a developing country) has universal coverage for citizens and residents!

I've got three kids and a husband, and we're at an age where friends have passed away. I'm trying to help myself mentally, emotionally, and physically. I wish someone had mentioned the possibility of ADHD earlier. Dr's have been telling me for years that it's because I'm a mom, and I'm supposed to be tired and scattered. Luckily my new Dr listened and mentioned an evaul. And what do you know? ADHD which explains so much about my life up to this point. Now I have the motivation to do things to better myself, and to be more present for my family."

Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"I really liked Adderall and felt like it made me more productive over the course of the day than Vyvanse. However, it made it easier to over focus and that'd make me snippy when interrupted. I also happen to enjoy what I do for work so even after it'd wear off I'd be inclined to keep hyper focusing and work into the night since it got me to the point where I could find the interest again. Vyvanse works in a much more subtle way, so even though I'm less productive on it than Adderrall I'm still productive enough and the pros outweigh the cons so it's better for me. 

Just as an fyi, there are non stimulant medications for ADHD but I've never taken them. I brought it up to my doctor but they weren't an option bc they couldn't be taken alongside other meds I was on."

Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"The U.S. medical system isn't bad like people make it out to be. My Vyvanse is totally free in the United States but because I got medicaid insurance when I was unemployed. You can only get Medicaid insurance if you're unemployed or low income and it doesn't take much to be considered low income. They verify your income yearly to see if you still qualify but there are millions, probably tens of millions of Americans that get totally free healthcare because they are low income. My insurance company who is funded by the government pays almost 700 a month for my Vyvanse. They would  probably only have to pay like $5 if I was just prescribed dextroamphetamine tablets which would literally be the same thing since the drug only works when lisdexamphetamine is converted to dextroamphetamine but the point of Vyvanse is it's harder to abuse so all that profit goes to Vyvanse manufacturers. Even though it's a generic drug now this year it still costs over $600 all together whether it's you or insurance paying, for the generic.  There's a lot of flaws in our system but it mostly has to do with greed, pharmaceutical companies making obscene profits and politicians supporting them, not the lack of access to healthcare."

Now, I spend the $10 a month to have rx gold (there is a free version and I think they would be like $42), and the price will depend what pharmacy you use, but you can look up how much it will be in every pharmacy in your area ahead of time and choose."

CVS seems to be really good, but depends on how much time and effort the person you are talking to at any given location will spend trying to find your best prices, discounts.

I’ve already lost two back teeth due to nerve damage from clenching (I was on dex and vyvanse alternating  for 17 years with no break and it did a number on my teeth, also don’t do well with night guards). I think I need a switch also because I can’t afford any more dental implants and already feel a tooth acting up. Anyways, it’s definitely not psychosomatic, it’s a known side effect of stimulants.

With Adderall, which is what I take now, it doesn't work as well. But if I take a day off I am not as tired and sluggish. 


I'd take vy again if my insurance covered it. But it did mess with my sleep."

Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,Have you tried swapping meds when you start to find the stimulant less effective? I jump between stimulants and the little tweak of a difference helps regain effectiveness.

Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"Serious question and I'm not trying to be an ass here:

If you do those things then why are you worried? What makes you not sold on the safety of stimulants? I respect your decision but I'd like to know why if you don't mind me asking."
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"That's what I initially thought....bc I remember back when I first took it 10 years ago and got off of it, I got brain zaps after a day or so and they were awful."

Of those the stimulants where far and away the most helpful. Moclobemide and Wellbutrin helped a little bit but with more side effects, the rest either did nothing or had mostly just side effects. 

I would be interested in trying Intuniv, but when I asked my doctor about Guanfacine she said it can't be prescribed. Seems like it's not approved for adults in my country. Maybe I could get it offlabel if I press her on it, but then my insurance might not pay for it because it's not approved for adults... and it's too expensive for me to pay out of pocket."

The worst is when one used to be very athletic up until being 40-something.  Now my brain still believes that if it issues commands to my body’s arms and legs to do “sporty things” it is very familiar with, the body responds with “umm… what did you want me to do again?” And “you’re kidding, right”.

Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"For sure. I went into the whole thing not wanting my dose to change (the stigma with amphetamine and whatnot) so I never take it when I know I don't need to ""perform"" on any given day.

Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"Lisdexamfetamine has the long lasting conversion, plus the conversion is into dextroamphetamine vs. the mixed salts (which includes some of less desirable/speedier isomers) of Adderall and lisdexamfetamine is not active when snorted or injected vs. Adderall or dexamphetamine which are active via these routes (to reduce diversion/abuse). 

I don’t remember what started the desire to do trials (just popping Lysine on to a structure), but it is one of the actual success stories imo for a sorta “Me Too” drug that actually has multiple benefits that make it an attractive options for a large group of patients. 

Unlike Nexium vs. Prilosec. A pure money grab for patent extension of nothing other that the new improve purple pill is the same drug but without including the inactive isomer and use misleading labeling for names when both generic names are synonyms."

Tolerance buildup is something that is highly variable between individuals.

Your reply implied that they were somehow wrong for taking a break once a week because it helps their tolerance. Just because that's not what you do in particular doesn't mean that it's wrong for someone else to do."

I originally went on it about three years ago and found it bolstered my meds effect and mood while taking the sharp edge off of my stimulant, making a huge difference (and I’ve been on meds for 18 years now, so have had a lot of runway to see what helps and doesn’t).

Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"Thanks a lot, this was very helpful! I'm interested if you happen to have found other meds or substances that made a positive impact as well. For example I struggle a lot with starting work tasks, but anecdotally a sip of alcohol does seem to help significantly with that. Arguably more so than the stimulants. Those mainly help against the depression. So I do suspect I would benefit from adding another medication that targets different receptors and I'm trying to narrow down which ones those might be and what my options are. 

I forgot to mention, I'm taking Propanolol against stimulant side effects and I find it helps notably with anxiety and phobias as well."

For a time I was drinking daily while (on stimulants, but in the evening when they wore off) to help me study in grad school but it became unhealthy and now I drink only very occasionally socially (or not at all, given that I’ve been pregnant/postpartum the past 20 months). I know there is an extraordinarily high propensity for alcohol use disorder among folks with ADHD especially when untreated so it’s something I’m also mindful of.

I’ve found high caffeine intake is a necessity off meds. On meds I still consume it but probably shouldn’t as it certainly increases side effects of stimulants.

That’s interesting about propranolol. I was on bisoprolol when I was in third trimester pregnancy because I had a POTS flare up (where your heart rate and blood pressure go wonky when standing or ping activities). I was on stimulants at the time but honestly can’t remember if it helped with the stimulants side effect besides maybe reducing heart rate (which is why I was taking it). It just made me feel very very tired. I know Guanaficine is used as a blood pressure med too but I think the mechanism of action is different.

I’ve not found any other meds/substances to be of much use. The only other mood targeting drug I’ve been on is antidepressants and I haven’t needed these since I began stimulants 18 year ago - turns out my depression was just untreated ADHD, so treating that worked much better for my mood than trying to target my mood directly. I still found I got some anxiety and mood swings that were worsened on stimulants, and Intuniv helped stabilize my mood and decrease my ‘stimulant anxiety’. At one point I also did a brief trial of non stimulants for adhd but they didn’t work for me.

Edit to add: for me, the best mood boosting stimulant (ie to reduce feelings of sadness and low mood/depressed feelings) by far is dexederine. It’s otherwise not the ideal med for me as I get lots of side effects and yet I keep returning to it because I get that extra mood boost."

Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"Thanks a lot for the detailed reply, much appreciated! I had a hunch alcohol might be working for you too, but it's a slippery slope for sure. I treat it as a last resort. From what I read the mechanisms at play there might lead to paying for it later the same way one does with taking benzos. 

I believe dexedrine is quite similar to vyvanse, but quicker acting and doesn't last as long.

I found the propanolol helps quite well against ""stimulant anxiety"" for me, not just for lowering the heartrate back down. I can't really compare it to bisoprolol because I only took that once. Neither of them made me tired. 

Caffeine is a tricky one, I haven't quite figured out yet what the right dose is for me. At the moment I drink one instant coffee in the morning, which should be around 40 to 50mg of caffeine, and any more than that seems to be detrimental. E.g. pepsi already is too much. Before I was on the proper stimulants I was leaning quite heavily on caffeine, but I can't tell for sure whether that was just addiction or whether it actually helped."
Taking a day off from Vyvanse after six weeks and woah... ,"For me, although they are relatively similar, dexedrine and vyvannse feel different enough in notable ways. I had to be on 70mg of vyvannse (max dose) and only 20mg on dexedrine (half the max dose) because I found vyvannse just didn’t give me the same buzzy ‘get up and get going’ initial stimulation that Dexedrine does. It lasts longer but takes longer to set in. I switch to it when I find things aren’t working as well for me with the dexedrine (meds switch up to reduce the tolerance) but always end up back on dex! 

And great to know about the propranolol. I may consider going back on a beta blocker if my heart rate starts spiking again. I just wish I didn’t get the fatigue, you are lucky that you don’t."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"You've gotten some good advice here, and it sounds like you're doing everything you can and should right now. I just wanted to offer some encouragement.

It's possible he might be close to accepting the routine. Do a search on something called ""extinction burst."" Essentially, it's a psychological phenomenon where right before unwanted behavior ends and a new habit is formed, the unwanted behavior will increase in intensity. Especially with your report that the last two mornings were especially bad, this might be exactly the time to keep up the consistency you've already got going. After a little longer he may just accept the routine.

That being said, I'm not a parent  and my knowledge of Psych comes from a couple of classroom management classes in college, and a brief stint in a middle school classroom as a teacher. So take what I say with a grain of salt as it might not apply here."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Maybe get with his doctor and see if he can be prescribed a capsule, and ask if it’s okay to be put on applesauce? My friend with ADHD also has a really hard time swallowing pills and has her whole life—I wonder if there’s a correlation.

If it can’t be switched to something that you can put into applesauce/yogurt, maybe try taking a pill with him every morning? Like, “Okay, time for mommy and you to take their pills.” That way he sees you taking your “medicine” while he takes his? And for this you could take a vitamin, or if you already take some kind of prescribed pill you could take that? Might help encourage him."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"This might not work at all, but it's an idea.

You said after he takes the medication he is sometimes aware that it is working for him and feels better on it, right? Could you have him in those moments draw a picture or a poster to remind his ""morning self"" that he actually likes the medicine once he's taken it?"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I’m an ADHD adult and I still have to remind myself that taking my meds is a good thing and I will go on “benders” where I go multiple days convincing myself that I “don’t need them today”. I share this to say that this a normal ADHD thing, continue having honest conversations so that when he is an adult he has a framework to continue to fight this battle as it moves internal. 

As a kid with untreated ADHD, my parents set up so much structure to help protect me, but when I became an independent adult I didnt have those structures, and I wasn’t on the medication I needed, so I struggled.  All this to say IMHO You’re doing the right thing. Let him make decisions and experience consequences when it’s low risk, and when it’s high risk, which school definitely is, let him try to make the right choice first, and if he can’t make the right choice in that moment, continue to intervene as a parent. 

He will thank you for it later in life."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,What have you tried so far? Reward chart? Treat after he takes it? Tablet/ipad time on the way to school if he takes it?
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"My 10yo used to refuse. We said this was fine, but he was responsible for his behaviour (mostly emotional control and physical lashing out to younger bro) and any consequences were on him. Generally by around 10am (because it was always weekends he would refuse) he'd be over getting into trouble/time outs/tech free and ask to take his meds. Perhaps giving yours the option and making sure he knows that his meds help functionally will help change his attitude towards them?"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Do you think he’s understood the connection between take meds-go to school and refuse meds-stay home?

I specifically work with problem behavior in kids with behavioral issues. 

I would strongly advise you NOT to mix your kid’s meds in with anything other than what you are using now - unless you want a kid that distrusts everything you put in front of him. People - do not sneak meds on your kids. You’ll end up causing way bigger problems for yourself. 

Here’s what I would do. Do something WAY fun as a condition of taking meds - “I’ll wait until you’re ready, but if you take this without a fight today, we’ll go bowling/go out for breakfast/go to the park instead of going to school this morning, and I’ll drop you off right after.” Do this for a few days. (He’s missing school anyway, might as well fix the problem.) 

Bring the meds with you in the car and make him take them before he can get out, he just has to be motivated to get to what’s next. You can slowly fade this out to smaller rewards at home - meds first then 15 minutes of YouTube, whatever. 

He needs to make a positive connection between taking meds and good things happening in his day. Having a good day at school is cool and all but he’s freaking 6. Do it big!"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"How much of this is about threats and compliance related to the struggle?

As an adhd parent (unmedicated I’m nursing) of a possibly adhd six year old I can imagine my kid and I in this position.

When we get into power struggles I sometimes spend a lot time threatening things that aren’t totally connected (“if you aren’t able to get dressed for school there won’t be tablet later) and I spend so much time in the threat that I relent once there is the tiniest bit of compliance (putting a shirt on) and suddenly we’re back in threats again.

I’ve been studying RIE parenting for a long ass time. It works well with adhd kids in my opinion. Once I set down my own feelings, validate theirs, stop threatening and actually enact a natural consequence without letting his behavior “get” to me the compliance is way, way higher.

If I were in your shoes I would:

Validate my sons fears about taking it. Say it can be scary to depend on medicine. Help him talk it out.

Let him know I won’t let him go to school or anywhere, or move forward in the routine until he’s taken his medicine because that’s what his doctor has told us needs to happen

Not in a punitive way, but then I wouldn’t let him move forward in the morning routine “ope can’t get that stated you haven’t taken your medicine yet! Let’s get that out of the way”

When you think about hard parenting boundaries: no car without seatbelt, no bike without helmet, etc etc you’ll realize you absolutely have the power to set and enforce this boundary; though credit where credits due it will be much harder than folks without adhd!"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"After certain ADHD meds wear off, there can be some negative effects such as depression or anxiety. It's a sort of withdrawal is how I'd describe it. Not as severe but it definitely isn't fun. I'd say the best thing to do would be to find him something he enjoys doing that he can do at the time when the medicine normally wears off. for me it's videogames because I can be myself and just mess around with friends, and also it keeps my mind focused in one place. 

Tl;dr: I don't think your son is as scared of the medicine as he is of what he experiences once it wears off. My advice would be to make that part easier if you can."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I think that at 6 he probably isn't capable of totally processing all of the benefits to taking it daily. A lot of kids fight things because they're not at the right developmental level to understand them, and who wants to do continuously do a bunch of things that don't make sense and seem arbitrary? Like, he's probably not able to consistently grasp, every single morning, ""okay, I took the medication yesterday, and yesterday was really good, but I still need it today or else today will be bad"".  Even though, in the long-term/abstract, he knows the medication is a good thing.

I think it's good that you let him make his own choices, and I definitely think that kids benefit from seeing how natural consequences of their choices unfold. Having said that, I think that at 6 he might be too young to make the connection (the choice and the benefit/cost) anyways. But I think that he will appreciate it later and it will ultimately be good for him, that his caregiver emphasized choice and freedom even in early childhood. That rocks. But he might not be at a point where he can process it yet. Time will tell, I think it's kinda one of those things. Your support team says you're doing it right, so trust the professionals who can validate what you're doing 

Also, I'd suggest you reconsider the ""doing it for attention"" thing. When hes fighting the medication, your kid is probably reaction to a genuine feeling or experience, even if it's not something that makes sense to you. There's probably something at play that's making your kid seem or act totally defiant.... and in general, *if* a kid is truly seeking attention, imo it's because their need for genuinely being seen and acknowledged by others isn't being met. Which doesn't sound like the case here. It's just a slippery slope to dismiss a kid's reasoning and feelings as attention seeking. :p 

I'm not a doctor, not a parent, but someone who should have been medicated for ADHD in early child and wasn't :p"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I don’t know if this will help - but I just refilled my weekly pill pot, and it’s pretty & colourful & brings me joy. 

And I think maybe that’s part of how I feel about taking the meds in the morning (also I’m nearly 50 so I “just know” they’re worth taking). 

But it makes me think - I’m very influenced by the mood of a thing. Is there any way that you can relocate where the meds happen - and make it something joyful & positive. 

I don’t know - maybe designate a corner of a room as The Meds Place and hang some balloons and he can make some art work (and some of the other ideas people have had - eg write himself notes about how good he feels on his meds). I bought myself a pack of blank certificates last year, and when I achieve something positive (doesn’t have to be a big thing) I write myself a certificate - or my SO does :-).  When good stuff happens when he’s medicated, you could write him a positive note."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"A *possible* options to consider if he's doing it for drama/attention. A little ""reverse psychology"", but also giving him control that it sounds like he doesn't like missing.

Try telling him he can't take his medicine for the next 2 weeks unless he asks for it (and at the correct time, like before breakfast). When he asks why, tell him you aren't going to argue with him anymore, so if he wants them, he has to ask.

This will only work if your family and school are all on board with supporting him.

For those 2 weeks, have his pill bottle by where he eats or whatever, but don't mention it. Have the school refrain from mentioning his medicine, especially on bad days, but if he's strugging, have them sit down and ask why he's struggling.

The point it to get him to start realizing, for himself, that he is happier with the meds. 6 is a precarious age of just starting to try to gain control over their lives and having absolutely no options to do so, usually. Add ADHD in the mix and it's rough for everyone, but it sounds like you're on the right track. Just be patient. This won't be his whole life."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,[removed]
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"There is a chewable methylphenidate, and there is also a chewable amphetamine, vyvanse.  Maybe those would be a good try for him?"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"What if he takes it right when he gets to school at the nurse's office so that for now the home battle stops and he has a new environment to set a different tone. Then it's like, take this and get to class. 
My kids also have OCD so taking pills is a whole thing, they are scared of what's in it. His mind might be telling him that something bad will happen if he takes it. That's an OCD trait that most people have from time to time, no pathology needed, our minds trick us sometimes."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Okay so I didn’t know I had ADHD at that age but I do remember I HATED being told what to do and I HATED being punished (the threat of it usually just made me stand my ground more, because it would mean admitting I was wrong?? And usually there is something GENUINE behind this and it’s embarrassing to think you’re being “silly”). Like I got into SCREAMING matches and missing school for stuff. I think an important thing to remember is that emotions are WEIRD with ADHD. They hit you and you don’t always have time to process it. So like when it’s a tantrum it didn’t always feel like sustained anger, but like constantly being hit with it. So if he had the feelings I had, it’s gonna kinda spiral.

Here’s me thing: bribery. Like serious, bribe the kid by tying it to something FUN. Instead of threatening to take stuff away when he doesn’t understand exactly why he’s afraid of something and having it spiral, maybe let him have it while watching a tiny bit of his favorite TV show or like a short YouTube video or something. Maybe give him a tiny bit of a favorite treat (like maybe he gets to have a tiny packet of m&ms). My dad once convinced me to eat a ton of spinach by having a “gross” contest and we chewed with mouths open AND while eating m&ms and it’s objectively a gross thing but like to this day I love spinach."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Have you considered if your son might also have anxiety?  Anxiety is very common for kids with ADHD.  During the two months that he’s been taking his meds, has he ever choked?  If he has, this could be the root of his fear. Perhaps you can try something else to mix it with? I know, you’ve probably tried everything under the moon, but just maybe there could be something that your son might love that you haven’t tried yet? My son also struggled with his meds, too. After about 2-3 months of taking his meds, he out of the blue claimed he no longer needed it and refused to take it. With all the progress we made, I was so worried that it’ll all be for nothing. We struggled for about 2 weeks and it eventually got resolved with ice cream.  I’m not sure how much your son loves apple sauce, but whatever food has to be something that will motivate him to take that first spoon. So if he doesn’t take that first spoon, he doesn’t get the rest of it. If the reward for getting that first spoon down isn’t enough of a motivation, it’s not going to work. As hard as it may seem, this food thing will have to keep changing. We started out with a cookie when he first refused. When cookies no longer worked we switched to ice cream. 

Also you mentioned that, saying that he’s scared always gets him out of stuff. This could just be your son’s way of testing if he can get out of taking his meds. He’s a smart kid and is just testing how far he can push you to make you give up. So don’t. Don’t give in. I say this because my it was a pure nightmare to get my son to see a psychologist. We spent 5 months of weekly appointments with him hiding in the corners, crying, screaming, refusing to see a therapist. When he could finally be coerced into seeing the therapist, he would sit and sulk and refuse to say anything. So many times I wanted to quit. So many times even the therapist seemed frustrated.  My husband said to stick it out for 6 months to a year, so we did. I think kids are super smart in their ways of tricking and handling their parents. I think my son was trying to test me to see how far he could push me to make me stop taking him. It took 5 months and 2 weeks before he uttered his first word. Since then week by week we see improvements. They may be small, but they’re improvements nonetheless. Hope this helps. I get how you feel. So many times it may just feel like giving in may be easier, but stick with it. I’m sure you have more determination to see your son getting better than your son’s willpower to refuse medication. Good luck!"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Hello!

I remember vividly my first time starting medication and this is purely my own experience of being 6 and getting Ritalin:

I hated it. I hated having to do something new because ""something's wrong with me"". It made me feel somehow excluded or different, and I remember having the biggest meltdown just about the time it became routine to do.

Apparently there's a psychological thing where right at the end point, you give your hardest to deny it before accepting it as a thing.

My only suggestion is to keep trying and having contact with a child psychologist."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Could he write a note to himself when he’s on his meds? So when he’s resistant, he can read his own handwriting telling him that it’s gonna be ok. It’s hard to trust someone else who doesn’t know what it’s like but maybe he could trust his past self?

EDIT: missed the part about him being six, lol. Maybe he can record a video on your phone comforting himself and telling himself it’ll be ok. Then when he’s nervous or resistant he can get real, concrete evidence that reminds him what it feels like to be on meds!"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I’m 37, I was diagnosed at 7. I hid taking meds from my parents for years, eventually I stopped taking them.

At 35 I wondered why everyone thought I was nuts, too extreme, distracted, untrustworthy. I got diagnosed again and am back on them. I regret not taking them my whole life.

You’re doing good. Do Not Stop. If it’s working, it’s working, and that’s EXACTLY what being medicated w adhd feels like. If it works, you’ve nailed it, and now you have to handle the adhd hate of “having to do something”."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,[deleted]
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"He’s only 6 yo, is it possible that he’s experiencing certain side effects that he can’t articulate yet? Some side effects of Ritalin (especially the Ritalin rebounds) can be counteracted by switching to an extended release version like Concerta. Alternatively, he could just be scared of the huge difference in how he’s feeling on and off his meds (regardless of if it’s a good or bad change for him). Or is he scared of swallowing the pill? Or of the sensory feeling of taking this medication?

In normal situations I’d suggest to stop the meds until your son is older if it’s such a struggle, but from your other comments I understood that his extreme behavior does warrant medication for his own safety and wellbeing.

Finally, I’ve heard about situations where there’s an accommodation (e.g. for kids with ASD) supported by a doctor’s note that a kid is allowed to be late to school. Maybe you could agree with the school on a similar accommodation, so that you can focus on getting him to take his meds without the stress that he may be too late to school? This would also remove the possibility of him avoiding school by refusing his meds."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I don't know if this is great advice, but this is my first instinct:

Rather than fighting and forcing just ask him every morning, ""do you want to take your pill today?"" If he does, he does, if he doesn't, he doesn't. No reason to stay home if he doesn't. 

After school each day, all him what happened that day, and how that might have gone if he had/ hadn't taken his medication.

You're not trying to convince him, or win an argument, you're trying to help him learn to make his own personal health care decisions the ways adults do. 

Mind you, I am not a parent, and I don't know if a five year old is capable of making those kinds of connections, but like I said, that would be my approach were I dumped into this situation today, with my current knowledge and life experience.

Edit: ask, not all"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I’m a school psychologist, so I do identify students with ADHD (can’t medically diagnose but do the same testing—often more—than people who can) and also work with students who have behavior problems.

I obviously haven’t seen your son in person and don’t know how this plays out. I agree that taking things away after school may be too delayed for him to make the connection. How long did you try doing a reward after he takes it? Specifically, getting candy or another treat? Because these types of interventions usually take weeks before seeing improvement. Someone did mention extinction burst where the behavior literally gets worse before it gets better. Sometimes we have to stick with the intervention to see an impact. If he isn’t motivated by a small candy, you could use a sticker where if he takes the pill 3/5 days without issue, then he earns a bigger prize on Friday or the weekend. And as he sees that he truly gets a reward and the behaviors improve, you can lengthen it to 4/5 days without issue.

I would also give him warning each morning. Someone mentioned waking up slightly earlier. You could set a timer for 10 minutes and say “I’m setting a timer for 10 min and when it goes off we have to take your medication. If you take it, then you’ll earn xyz.” Give him a warning at 5 min. Then give him a warning at 1 min. Then you can say “the timer went off, it’s time to take your medication. Then you can earn xyz.”

You could also turn it into a game somehow, I’m almost thinking like “here comes the plane” for babies but for an older child.

These are just random ideas I had! They may not work but I definitely recommend giving the strategy at least a month (in fact interventions typically need to go for 6-8 weeks to see improvement) before changing it."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"This is what I'd do, please bear in mind that I'm not an expert, nor am I guaranteeing this will work, it's just what I'd try next.

Immediately stop the hour-long nagging, wheedling, arguing, fighting, begging, pleading with him to please take his meds.

From now on you ask *once*, after he's taken his breakfast, keeping a calm, casual, conversational tone throughout. 

""okay, it's time to take your meds so you can have a good day at school, eat up!""

And then, if he doesn't take them - 

""I'm not going to argue with you. It's up to you whether you take your meds, I can't force you. If you choose not to take them, it means you can't go to school, because if you don't take your meds you might put yourself or someone else in danger. So I'm going to ask you only once, the choice is yours. Are you going to take your meds right now so that you can go to school today, yes or no?""

Then follow through. Call his bluff. Don't ask again. If he says no, say - again in a calm, casual, conversational tone, no anger or annoyance - 

 ""Okay then, I hear that you're not going to take your meds, so there's no school today. If you change your mind and decide you want to take your meds, just ask."" and immediately telephone the school. Don't get into an argument, don't ask again, don't give him ""one more chance"", just do it. 

Chances are? He'll give in and take his meds once he realises you're serious.

 It might be during or even after you make the phone call (in which case you can just phone up again). But the point is it won't be an hour long battle. Because you're phoning the school the FIRST time he says no. 

If he calls YOUR bluff and doesn't take his meds, follow through. He stays home. But make no mistake, it's going to be the most boring day ever.

He doesn't get to watch TV or play video games. ""Sorry bud, it's a school day. There's no TV or video games on school days.""

He DEFINITELY doesn't get to go outside the house. ""Sorry bud, you can't go outside. It's a school day, and you're supposed to be in school, so if anyone sees you outside they might report me."" (My own mother used this line on me to great effect) 

He definitely doesn't get an exciting lunch or any snacks. He gets a boring lunch, whatever YOU would normally eat while he's at school. 

You certainly don't have time to play with him. You're a busy parent and the school hours are when you do the chores. If he says he's bored? He can do his homework, or help you with the vacuuming, the dishes, the dusting, whatever is the most boring thing. ""Sorry bud, it's a school day and you're supposed to be at school. This is when I clean the house, so I can't play with you or entertain you. I can't cancel my routine just because you're at home.""

This might go on for one or two days. Maybe a week at most. But I will tell you, eventually he'll realise going to school is much more fun than staying in this boring house with nothing to do. 

So one day soon, when you ask him  ""are you going to take your meds right now so that you can go to school today, yes or no?"" the answer will be yes.

In fact he may even ask to take his meds part way throughout the day. If so, give them to him when he asks (provided it's not too late that it's going to affect his sleep) and then take him to school. Doesn't matter if he's an hour late or only shows up halfway through the day. 

And when he does take his meds? Don't make a big deal out of it. Don't scream ""yay! Well done!"" and make a big fuss out of what a good boy he is. Taking meds isn't an achievement or something to celebrate, it's just a normal, boring part of your day. So when he eats the applesauce just casually acknowledge it - ""okay, you've taken your meds so now it's time to brush your teeth so that you can go to school."" and then carry on with the routine."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I was medicated young as well. I dont remember if it helped because I was 8 and self reflection isnt great during those years lol. I do remember not liking being the weird kid taking pills. I'd throw the pills behind the fridge when my parents wernt looking. I was supposed to go to the school office at lunch to take another ritalin. And it was difficult to a) remember when all you want to do at lunch is run around with friends so I'd often forget, sometimes getting called over the speakers and b) just being the only kid having to go take medication.

Maybe your son feels like the odd man out?

It sounds like you're really checking in with him emotionally. Which is great. My mom just threw medication st the issue but with no understanding of how adhd presents ie ""laziness"" etc.

As an adult looking back I wish that I'd had some sort of adhd therapy/coaching to go along with it. To help me understand everything and work on building coping and learning mechanisms that wernt just ritalin.

Not sure if any of that was helpful. But good luck to you!"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"What is he doing before he takes his meds? Is he reading? Playing? Playing a video game?

Is there a specific activity or thing that happens directly after taking his meds? Does taking his meds trigger a transition to school? My kid doesn't like putting their shoes on because it means transitioning from home to school which she doesn't want to do. Taking his meds might just trigger the transition that he doesn't want to do. It doesn't matter that he likes school, the idea of transition from one activity to another is hard for young kids and kids/people with ADHD. 

This sounds more like anxiety than ADHD, but ADHD does make anxiety worse. Here is the thing about anxiety, it doesn't make sense. Every morning, his brain literally probably goes, ""what if I don't like school today? What if someone is mean? What if I don't have fun?"" IT DOES NOT MATTER THAT NONE OF THIS HAS HAPPENED. What he knows is he is safe and happy at home and doesn't want to 'take the chance' that he might have a bad day at school. Taking his meds might trigger the transition to school so he's associating the anxiety around going to school to taking his meds. If he doesn't take his meds, he doesn't go to school then he doesn't have to 'potentially' have a bad day. 

Can you change when he takes his meds? Maybe something not related to a transition, maybe as part of his getting ready routine. Maybe something like this: Go to the bathroom, brush teeth, take meds, get dressed. Try and sandwich the meds somewhere between an already established routine that isn't directly tied to a transition. 

I would stop asking why he doesn't want to take them and start asking, 'what will help take your meds?' Right now, he likely sorta of views his meds as an option, that if he refuses than he doesn't go to school. It needs to change that taking his meds isn't an option, but how/when he takes them is an option. 

Try and correlate to another thing the has to do, like getting dressed or brushing his teeth. But he gets to pick out what clothes he wants to wear or maybe he gets to pick the tooth paste flavor he brushes with or what tooth brush he wanted. 

Talk to him outside the morning. Maybe tonight after school, ""Hey, you've been struggling to take our meds. Taking your meds isn't an option, just like \*insert any other thing that isn't a requirement\* but you're having a hard time how we're doing it now. Let's try a new way to see if it makes it easier. Should we try, after you brush your teeth but before you get dressed? Should we try after we're ready to walk out the door for school? Should I ask you when you want to take them each morning. Maybe some days you want to take them first thing in the morning, maybe sometimes you want to wait a little bit. But they do need to be taken before X time every day, so if you wait until X time that's when we'll take them"" 

I don't know if this has been mentioned, but make sure he's taking them on the weekend too. After he's built the routine and you're past the struggle, you can potentially open up the idea of letting him skip meds occasionally. The max I would allow is once a week, this way he doesn't associate meds = school. He can have a med free day 1 of the 2 weekend days but still needs to take his meds 1 of the days. You might even want to do it once every 2 weeks to start. This is if everyone agrees that he is okay at home w/o taking his meds. If he is having a hard time and generally makes things more difficult w/o meds, I would not consider this until he has developed coping skills to handle things without his meds."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"There's a lot of good information here already! Don't listen to those questioning your decision to treat his ADHD with medicine - medicine is needed more often than not when treating ADHD, and it actually helps the child's brain develop more like a neurotypical child's.

I agree with other commenters here that maybe switching to a chewable methylphenidate (Quillichew) could help if he has anxiety about swallowing a pill. If this is something you might be interested in, definitely plan to talk to his doctor.

The only thing I haven't seen discussed in this thread is side effects. Has he complained of any unpleasant side effects, like headache, stomachache/nausea, food tasting weird, heart racing, etc.? Because he's 6, he'll have difficulty communicating his internal experience to other people and even himself. Helping him explore his internal experience, both physical and emotional, will probably have a significant impact.

It seems like you're trying to do this already, and you clearly care about your son's wellbeing. Just keep trying to do the next right thing, and don't listen to the naysayers."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"You’re doing an amazing job! I’m sure it must be a very stressful situation so don’t forget to take care of your needs too! Have you considered that the “crash” could be a factor in why he doesn’t want to take it? When I first started taking stimulants, that was the worst part. Everyone reacts differently when it wears off but for me I could instantly feel when it was out of my system because I’d get a terrible headache and be exhausted. It was to the point where I’d rather not take them than experience the crash even though my day was so much better when I took them. My psychiatrist said that some people take a small booster dose later in the day to help prevent a big crash. 

At the end of the day it helps to remember that he has a valid reason for not wanting to take them but he’s just a kid and he might not have the vocabulary or experience to explain to you what is bothering him (he might not even know why it bothers him. I didn’t wear jeans for years and just told my mom that I didn’t like them but didn’t know why. Looking back on it with what I know now, I’m able to see that it was because they were causing me sensory issues but at the time I couldn’t explain that and I didn’t even know what sensory issues were. All I knew is that I didn’t like them.) I know it’s frustrating but you really are doing an amazing job. It seems like you have a great support system and are willing to try different things until you find what works for him and your family. It’s obvious that you are a good parent and are doing everything you can for him."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Phew! I’ve just gone through and read all the comments and I just want to preface mine by saying; I don’t have kids, BUT I (26f) do have an 11yr old brother who I’ve basically been a second Mum to, and I also work in disability support care for complex, high needs clients, so my comment will be pulled from both of those life experiences, as well as my own.

I went undiagnosed with ADHD until early 2020, and started Vyvanse pretty much as soon as I was diagnosed by my psychiatrist. I also have BPD, so I have personal experience with emotional disregulation and can actually kinda relate to your son’s behaviour. My brother was diagnosed with ADHD at 4 years old, and has been on Ritalin since roughly 5/6 years old. The main client I work with (32f) has many health conditions, but one main one we work on is emotional disregulation caused by ADHD and traumatic brain injuries.

Your son’s behaviour reminds me very much of what my own mother went through with me at a similar age, as well as what my client can elevate to when she’s upset. As a child (toddler even, tbh), my behaviour was very similar to what you’re describing your son’s to be. I would cry, scream, kick, throw and break things, even bite, if I wasn’t getting my way, felt I wasn’t having my needs met, or was overwhelmed and not know how to express what I was feeling in a healthy way. My main client is non-verbal, has the behavioural development of a 5 year old and her behaviour can be just as severe for the same reasons. She’ll cry, scream, throw or smash things, pull her hair, etc. if she feels her needs aren’t being met, if she’s unable to regulate her strong emotions, or if we don’t do something juuuuust right.

The strategy my mother used 20+ years ago, and the same strategy we use at work, is to *disengage*. Disengagement means removing yourself physically as far as safely possible, not responding verbally and no eye contact. By disengaging you are no longer feeding into the negative behaviour, and it will eventually run its course and (theoretically) the brain will, again eventually, regulate itself again, and the behaviour returns to baseline.

Let me give you an example. My client (let’s call her Jane) does *not* like taking her bedtime medication. She takes all other meds fine, but just those one are a struggle. She is FULLY aware that she needs to take them and that they help her and make her feel good, but for whatever reason (remember, she’s non-verbal, so she’s unable to communicate the reason why) she just doesn’t like taking them. All staff follow the same routine every night;
- evening staff arrive at house
- staff set up “first-then-then” board, which is a laminated piece of paper that we put pictures of staff or activities on to help remind Jane the order that things will happen in. So in this instance, the staff puts a picture of them self under “first”, a picture of dinner under the first “then”, and finally a picture of medication under the last “then”. We set it up with Jane upon arrival and say “Okay Jane! So *first* [staff] arrives, *then* Jane has dinner, *then* Jane will have her bedtime tablets, okay?”. Jane will 9/10 give a thumbs up, meaning okay/good/yes, meaning she’s understood and accepted this is what will happen.
- staff then cook and serve Jane dinner, which she eats.
- throughout this process, if Jane mentions wanting a bath or to play her video game, staff will say “Jane can have a bath after she finishes her dinner and takes her bedtime tablets”, or “Jane can play her video game after she has her bedtime tablets”, “First Jane has her bedtime tablets, *then* Jane can play video games”, etc. (you get the idea).
- Once dinner is finished, staff place bedtime tablets in a medicine cup next to Jane, and calmly and confidently (both very important) say “Jane can have her tablets now please”. 
- if she’s in a good mood, she’ll take them and it’s a win. If she doesn’t however…
- staff then repeat prompt: “Jane needs to take her tablets now”.
- if she still doesn’t take them, she cannot proceed to any other activity. Jane knows this. We don’t forcibly restrain her obviously, but if she asks us to run a bath, or help with her video game (main two things she’ll do after dinner), staff refer back to the “first-then-then” board.
- With a whiteboard marker, staff tick off the activity and say “look Jane! First [staff] arrives •tick•, then Jane has dinner •tick•, then Jane has her tablets. Oh no! [staff throw hands in air] Jane hasn’t had her tablets yet! [staff name] can’t tick it off until Jane takes her tablets”.
- If she’s *still* refusing and her mood elevates, which means she’s heading towards disregulation and essentially a temper tantrum, staff will disengage. She can throw her stuff, her video game controllers, ipad, drink cups, whatever. Staff do no engage. I personally will remove myself from the room entirely and sit in the staff room just off the living room. Jane can still see me and I can still keep an eye on her, but I’m out of the room and no longer participating in the behaviour. I’m not concerned about whether or not anything she throws, slams or smashes breaks, bc Jane is aware that her behaviour has consequences, even if the behaviour is out of her control. If she breaks her iPad, guess what? She doesn’t have an iPad for however long until it gets fixed or replaced, which is *not* fun for her, lemme tell ya.
- Now, remember how I said at the beginning that Jane knows that her tablets are a good thing? Well it’s right about now that she starts remembering and accepting that. Once staff have disengaged, Jane eventually calms down and her emotions regulate again, she returns closer to baseline. Once the more severe behaviour is finished, she’ll notice her tablets next to her on the table, and take them herself. Once she’s done this, staff return, reengage, and praise her. “Good job Jane! Thank you for taking your tablets! Does Jane still want a bath? Let’s get the bath ready”, and the night continues and the routine can progress. 
Over time, and from consistency in routine and time spent with her, I personally have very few behavioural issues with Jane anymore. I firmly believe that it’s greatly due to the fact that I do the exact same thing, at the exact same time, in the exact same way, every single night. Early on I set boundaries regarding what I would and wouldn’t accept with her behaviour. “Jane, [insert behaviour] is not okay and unacceptable. If Jane keeps [behaviour], [my name] will leave the room”. Pretty quick she figured out that I wasn’t playing her game and she either took her tablets when she was first supposed to and got to keep on with her night, or she didn’t, her behaviour elevated, and I’d walk away. Those are always her two options. I’m extremely lucky that Jane and I get along wonderfully and so I now have very few issues, however other staff will have to go through the negative behaviour regularly on shift."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I didn't see this discussed but there are lots of responses, so my apologies if this is duplicate.  

My friend's child has expressed to me that he's afraid his medication is controlling him. This I can completely understand. So we had a discussion on his level about how brains work and that some people just have missing chemicals and that makes doing things difficult for their brains. The medicine is a **tool** to help the brain because it supplies the missing chemical and this is what makes his life easier. So on the outside it looks like he's maybe being 'controlled' by the drug. But in reality his brain is just functioning as it was intended without intrusive thoughts and distraction. It's not changing him, he's *allowing* it to *help* him and change his life. But it's a change, and change is scary for everyone, so he probably feels like he doesn't have control over the situation.  

This is a very complex idea to explain to a small child. I'd suggest bringing in a child friendly pharmacist to the mix to explain, if at all possible. Your pharmacist is your most accessible health care provider too.    

It also sounds like he's got a bit of an impulse control issue (my friend's child takes guanfacine for this) and from my experience kids with this type of issue experience an huge change with medication kicking in. They oscillate between two states every day as drug levels increase and decrease throughout the day which is fucking terrifying when you think about it. Maybe a different, longer acting medication is called for once he can swallow pills. There are options that don't involve stimulants. 

Hope this helps!"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I don’t suppose having a candy he likes as a reward for taking it would work? 

My sister did that to get my nephew to take his asthma medication. He took it and got a cookie."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,You’re a great parent 💕💕. A lot of children hate taking medicine that doesn’t mean it’s bad or wrong to still give it to him. Kids will be kids.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,My brother was like this keep fighting your doing the right thing. I've seen what happens when he stopped and my parents gave in stopped taking him to therapy stopped giving him his meds. I don't know how to help I wasn't diagnosed till 23 just dropping in to tell you good job. You could quite possibly be saving his life.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"He may not like how different his headspace feels on them, even if it's a good different. That kind of implies that not being on meds is somehow a bad different, and little kids can get surprisingly deep about self-image. Ask him how it feels when his medication starts working and if that feeling of his brain changing gears is what's scaring him. If so, that's something specific you can address, and it's a good sign he's going to be good at telling you when his dosage needs adjusting as he grows, too."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Ok so, why is he scared? Is it because some of the physical side effects freak him out and he doesn’t know how to say that? New meds sometimes make me feel weird and my adderall gives me a tight chest /heart burn for a few hours if I don’t take it with food. Could there be something he is feeling that goes away that could explain the scared but later happy to be on the meds?"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I presume you have, but have you tried to ask what he is really disliking about it? What is he scared of? Stuck in his throat?"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"It sounds like anxiety. Everything you’ve said here sounds *exactly* like my son who’s in the process of getting an official adhd diagnosis but is already diagnosed with anxiety. 
I spent years battling him with important things like getting him to school, getting shots, going to therapy, getting him to sleep in his own bed etc, and even though he has been diagnosed with anxiety for a few months now and even though I’ve dealt with my own severe anxiety and panic disorder my entire life, it just somehow didn’t click until very recently that anxiety was at the root of almost all of his (very severe) anger issues and that shifted my entire perspective about… everything. 
I, of all people, should’ve recognized this sooner as I get very irritable when I’m anxious, especially when I’m under pressure. And if I’m unable to hide it by not having a space to be alone until I calm down, it’s really deeply troubling, makes me feel like I’m a monster or something and honestly it’s very humiliating no matter how understanding the people are that I’m around. Even though I’m able to control my actions and words, and remind people that I’m not mad because of them, I can’t help but speak it in an angry tone, and I hate it so much. And it took me 28 years to make sense of it and learn the best way to manage it… so as a child with anxiety, you can imagine how frightening and lonely it must feel to have all these huge feelings and nearly (if not completely) uncontrollable urges and not understand why.
After really sitting with this “realization”, and becoming overtaken by empathy, I’ve talked with him about anxiety and apologized to him for not understanding sooner, and for probably making things a lot harder for him by not handling all these situations the way he needed me too. Since then, my discipline strategies make sense for the first time, and we have made a mountain of progress in a super short amount of time. I feel closer to him, he is so much brighter and calmer in general, he is finally making a visible effort to manage his behavior, his outbursts are shorter, he has started saying “I feel scared” in place of his usual “I hate school, I hate my teacher, I hate you” etc. 
We have a LONG way to go still and things are not anywhere close to easy or even kinda easy, but man did I need a wake up call years ago. No matter who you are and what support you have etc I feel for you because being a parent to a child with behavioral issues like ours is fucking hard. 
I have no idea if this is what’s happening with your child but since you said he’s totally fine as soon as he swallows it, I can’t help but think he is being honest when he says he’s scared.
SO I guess what I’m getting at with this novel is that my advice to you is to keep doing what you’re doing if you believe that it’s helping him, and it sounds like you do. I wouldn’t give in if I were you, because as I’m sure you already know, if you give in once it just puts you back to square one. If you haven’t already I would try explaining to him that the reason you’re making him take it is because you both know that it’s what is healthiest for him, and that you understand that fear irrational or not is not easy to deal with, but what is important is not giving into that feeling, because when you do it just gets stronger. We like to think of anxiety as a little voice in our minds that is separate from us, and that we are able to decide whether we let it boss us around or not. My kid seems yo really like it when I make light of situations like this by pretending to have a conversation with his anxiety and using a silly voice as the anxiety. 
Anyway, I hope that my experience and perspective helps a little! You’re doing better than you think you are!

Edit to add: sometimes people are scared of things even if they want those things. Like my son with going to school- he loves school, he always has, but still sometimes (usually after an extended break) he will fight tooth and nail to not go until he walks through the doors and then he’s *perfectly* fine!
On the days that he fights it less than usual, even just slightly less- reward that progress. Clearly point out that you saw he was better than the day before and applaud him for it- even if you still need to take a toy away for hitting or something. Celebrate the tiny bits of progress and it will get easier I promise!"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,[deleted]
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"When he says he’s scared, does he mean scared of taking the medicine? If it was my son (& realistically, this whole issue could well be in my 5yo’s future), I would ask him more questions. ‘What is it that’s got you feeling so worried?’ Then ‘what would be the worst thing that could happen?’ Then ‘if that does happen, what will you/I/we do?’ I ask with a genuine tone, & intentionally remove all condescension from my voice, because I want him to answer the questions. I want him to know I want to help. & then talking things through, actually relieving the underlying fear, makes the biggest difference. 

So you don’t think I’m perfect: have also yelled at said 5yo for procrastinating getting ready for school 2/3 mornings this week. 😬 You’re not alone in having big feelings as a parent about this whole situation. It’s a lot, & then the behaviour just grates, & logically you can see a solution but then he won’t cooperate. I’d tear my hair out too. Dr Becky Kennedy is a useful resource for me."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I just had another thought, if there is something he tends to hyper focus on maybe you can use that to your advantage. Let him watch his show or play his game, come over with the spoon of applesauce/meds and just say “open up buddy, I’m just going to give you your medicine real quick!” It may not work, but it seems like it might be worth a try! Especially if you can get it into his mouth before the medicine has time to dissolve and make the applesauce taste bad."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Hi! I haven’t gone through and read all the comments because there’s a lot! So hopefully something in here will help🥰 I work with children with adhd and I’m an adhd adult myself! Validating his fear of taking the meds is really important! Being able to have a conversation about why he doesn’t want to take them and addressing that is a good place to start. I read a comment about choking and that can be quite traumatic for children, a lot of ‘pocketing’ food in the mouth comes from a choking incident but making sure he knows that you won’t let him get hurt and that a grown up will help him if he needs it, that there’s water near by if it’s hard etc. Story books for children are fantastic for difficult feelings! There will be lots of stories for children who take medicine and this could be a really lovely transition ( reading a short picture book before taking the meds) getting into this routine where he knows it’s coming and he’s prepared and calm. After reading the book a few times and getting used to it, try to incorporate taking meds whilst reading (as a distraction). On a day where he has taken them well and feels calm, maybe try an activity together like having a printed photo of him which he can label with how he feels when he’s happy, or drawing a picture of himself and you can label together what he feels when he’s taken his meds ie ‘They help me do my work’ .When it’s difficult or a really hard day, just keep reminding him why he likes taking them and refer back to the activity and picture of himself so he can remember. I can imagine It must be really tough on you, please don’t feel disheartened- you’re doing great, you really are ☺️"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Have you asked him? As in, in a moment, where he is good and talking about how it helps him, just ask him.

""Hey son, you know how you keep saying how much the ritalin helps you right? You are happy to have it right?""
""So, sometimes in the mornings, you dont wanna take it. Do you remember that? How come you dont wanna take it, when you know it will help you?""
""So mommy and daddy wanna help you take the meds, because you say how much they help you. But we dont really know how to help you to take them best. Can you help us? What do you think is the best way to help you take them? What do you think would work best for you?"" 

Kids like helping and feeling useful. When he suggest an idea to you, pride even plays a little part in it, he would want his idea to work cause it makes him feel and sound smart for finding the solution to a problem, and helping his parents! Emphasize how much of help it would be. 

This has worked wonders for me on many nanny kids!"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I fucking hate taking my medication, I hate how it makes me feel..... but I would 100% would of ended up in prison. From what gathered your son also has the classic Bart Simpson hyperactive ADHD. I know it's a hash, crude treatment but medicating your son is the right thing to do. The early you start the less pain and rejection your son will experience. 

What motivates me to take my medication is how much easier is it for other people to be around me. On the days your son takes him medication, use the medication as a tool to connect to him in a way that isn't possible normally. Trust me, over time he will start to value the connection the medication can bring more and more. 

Also I recommend understanding why your son is agianst taking his medication, I promise you it's not for attention. For me the medication removes a part of myself that is at the core of who I am..... but that part of myself isn't particularly accepted by society. Look, if it's not Ritalin your son will seek something else to alter his state of consciousness to fit in. Alot of us on the more extreme end of the hyperactive impulse spectrum either end up addicted to drugs and or in prison if the ADHD isn't treated. 

""Shut the fuck up and take your pills""  I know he will hate for it now, I know how hard it is to drug a child but trust me, I wish my mother medicated me when I was that age."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"   I wake my son up at 6am, walk him to the bathroom and slip the first half of his meds into his mouth while he is still half asleep. Then it's back to bed for an hour while the med starts to kick in and the rest of the morning routine goes more smoothly including the rest of his meds and supplements. 
   For us, it's hard to get medications and breakfast into an unmedicated child. So for years now, I slip the first dose in while he is not awake enough to object. And by breakfast time he usually has the impulse control to not kick his sister."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,[removed]
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Wanting attention is normal and healthy for six year olds. Is it possible to incorporate more time where he is the sole focus of your attention? Maybe if he gets more story time at bed or similar quality time, he won't act out as hard for it in the morning. Maybe"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"This is manipulative, but my Ritalin is a capsule that can be opened up and the powder can go in food and drink. Could that work?"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Personally I wasn’t put on meds as a kid, and I disagree with putting kids that young on meds as it’s too early. Have you thought about giving it a few years until he’s a bit better at rationalising why he needs to take it?"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I know the pain of wanting to help your son. We didn’t want to give on son meds either. we evidently  tried it  although it did help him we didn’t like the side effects and the life long journey of taking medication.🙁

We decided to try a whole foods diet. We discovered that he would have severe reactions to red dye #40. he would lose control, panic attacks, anxiety and anger. By eliminating red dye#40 was game changer!!!!

That awful stuff should be BANNED!! I remember it was illegal when I was a kid.

We also used essential oils by doTERRA to help with his anxiety. he uses digestion and serenity. even when he was little he would keep them in his pocket for whenever he felt his anxiety was getting out of control. He kept it hidden from his friends in a little coat pocket.

he said it helped him feel better. so even though he still suffers from the short attention span.  we have also learned coping skills to help him with his anger.

“have a new kid by Friday” is a great book and a must read…
anyways I hope some of these tips help"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I have ADHD and don’t take meds. Millions of people across the word don’t know they have ADHD and don’t take meds.

I was prescribed meds as a preteen and I never had my diagnosis even fully explained to me. I just thought it was some “behavior medicine”. 

I took it a couple times, felt really in-control and witty and good at socializing. Then I got paranoid about being dependent on that feeling and felt I didn’t want to depend on any substances.

That “not wanting to depend on any substances” is a valid feeling. The artificial element of ADHD medicine can indeed be frightening to your child. 

Im not here to tell you what is right/wrong, but I think all human beings should be able to decide for themselves if they want to consume artificial pharmaceuticals that alter their cognitive state. 

That is some deep existential shit and society frequently puts these decisions in the hands of parents. But intelligent children may recognize that this is a decision that maybe SHOULD be their own decision. If you are taking away that choice and discussion from your child, I personally understand why it becomes such a battle.

Good luck, I think you should allow your child to decide and should never feel corned into taking a pill."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"A six year old. Wow. 
His brain development will more or less finalize in 19 years. Till then good luck is all I can say."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,Bruh why are you giving a 6 yo Ritalin? His brain is 20 years from being done developing. Wait a little bit at least to give him drugs🙄
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"My son probably has ADHD, but I don't think I would ever drug up his developing brain.

When he needs attention, I give him attention. When he is scared, which has become a real issue lately, I hope to talk it out with him and calm him down. Though I admit it's not easy."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,This is mean but you could tell him if he can’t take the meds you’ll have to go with the shot instead.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Maybe he doesn’t like the way it makes him feel … hence the “scared” comment. He’s 6 … does he really need meds at 6? Maybe forgo it and just set him up with lots of structure and positive reinforcement. I started meds at age 11 … it actually traumatized me because I was expected to be “normal” and I still had a lot of issues. My family would pressure me into taking meds and it causes a lot of self esteem problems. It’s so easy for us to just medicate and hope things will be better, but ADHD is way more complex then just disorganized and hyperactive. IMO"

Getting my son to take his Ritalin,Try the stimulants that u can add to his food instead of a pill he has to swallow. Maybe his gag reflex is juat strong and he doesnt have the vocabulary to tell you?
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"OP, as an ADHD adult myself (with two ADHD children; one is now an adult, and was missed growing up--like I was missed--and the other a teen), I've had to learn new ways of communicating with my teen. Such as follows:

""I know you're scared about the medicine; I understand. I'm kinda scared, too, buddy, but don't you have better days at school when you take it? I mean do you wanna be noticed for acting out, or be noticed for doing well? Like you told me you do when you take your medicine? It's up to you, buddy, but please think about it.""

I know 6 might be a little young, and you'll for sure have to catch him before the defenses are up. I propose going into his room while he's still sleeping (but close to his normal waking hour), run your fingers through his hair very gently, using the language I've written above, or your own modifications thereof.

This approach has the advantage of being non-threatening, emotions aren't up yet, etc.

The important thing is that you stay calm the whole time.

Again, I'm not a professional, and the foregoing is not medical or therapeutic advice; it's just a suggestion from one parent to another. YMMV."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I started taking Concerta when I was 8 and it took a lot of convincing from my mom/brother to get me to take it. I remember to me it was really hard adjusting to the side effects of the medication, especially as a child. And I had a hard time swallowing pills with water, so my mom had me take them with sunny D, which definitely helped. Just be patient and keep listening! And there’s a possibility that a different type of medication may be needed."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I take vyvnase, which comes in powder in a capsule. My dr has said it’s totally okay to open the capsule and dissolve it in water! I use this method to easily modify dose when weaning on and off of medication, but prob could this method  for this purpose too. Check with dr on other methods to administer.

Also, sometimes when my medication kicks in it’s like a jolt of body anxiety, especially when    The dose is slightly too high OR when I don’t have any tolerance. I take a smaller dose on Mondays than I do on Fridays for this reason!!!"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"It’s simple: He’s a 6 year old child and pills are gross

No kid likes taking pills"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I don’t know if this would be considered too manipulative, but since I really struggle to wake up, I have this system: When the alarm goes off, I take my elvanse + caffeine pill and snooze 15 min. Could you wake him 15 min earlier, and give it to him while he is a bit groggy, and then let him snooze?"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"How about try the patch or try Vyvanse. Ritalin is hard on, hard off, maybe he doesn't like that feeling and doesn't know how to tell you. Vyvanse can be stirred into liquid also - like a protein shake, for good am mental function."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,I was the same way. I knew the medication was for me but I refused to take it because I just didn’t feel like I wanted to be changed. It’s weird
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"So i had the same issues as you kid as a child and i remember it being because i was TERRIFIED of choking on the pill, and little me couldnt understand that most likely i couldnt, and i swallowed food much larger. That may be the issue here. That he's genuinely scared of choking, esp cause he's saying he's scared, and you said in the comments he has anxiety. (Something i also have)

It would help if i could have it in some sort of yogurt, or liquid. Maybe doing ritalin patches or something that doesn't require him to swallow a pill quite yet untill he gets a better understand of big emotions and can truly understand he wont choke, and that he can swallow pills safely. Also i remember my doctor telling my parents to try and help me get used to swallowing pills with tic-tacs. So maybe try that as well."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,Both my son and daughter have ADHD (as well as yours truly) and they really struggled with having the meds sprinkled on foods.  We switched docs and the new doc put my son on  Contempla (it's a meltaway methylphenidate like Concerta or Ritalin LA)  and my daughter Adzenys (another meltaway that's like Adderall XR).  The kids seem to do really well on it and they don't mind the taste.  The Contempla is grape flavored and all he has to do is place it on his tongue and it melts and works the whole day.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Look i don't have kids so take this with a grain of salt. But maybe you could tell him that he can talk to you about the medication once he's back from school, and just kind force him to take in the morning. Not literally force him, tell him in advance that if he doesnt take he can't go to school or use his tablet i dont know. And in the morning just keep repeating that it's time to take it.

I say this because i tend to procrastinate things i don't like, and maybe the medication tastes bad even with food. If thats the case he's gonna fight you everyday, just like i fight myself all the time 🙄.  He should have input on the subject of medication but mornings before school is not the time."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,Perhaps making it into a challenge? Keeping a chart on what time in the morning he took it or how long it took for him to take it and see if he can beat the score? Or give a weekly goal of 10 minute total and if over the course of the five school days the combined time was 10 minutes or less he gets a reward?
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Could there be someone who is telling him to not take the medicine. I remember my grandma used to tell me to not take it, and made me promise her to not tell that she told me not to. As a result, I didn't want to take ADHD meds because of her."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,I wonder if he might not like Ritalin and might like different formulations instead? When I was trying meds the first couple had a lot of side effects I didn’t like and stopped taking them immediately. If I was a kid and an adult was making me take the ones I didn’t like I would be unhappy as well. Maybe adderall or dexedrine would be better?
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,Have you tried making it a race? When I was a kid my mom would turn things I didn't want to do into a race. Don't want to clean your room? Let's race to see can can get their room clean fastest. Don't wanna get dressed? I bet I can beat you putting my clothes on. So maybe be like oh you don't wanna take your medicine? I bet I can take my medicine before you finish yours  Just a thought. If you try it don't let him win every time because then it's not fun.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Maybe Dr. Becky (the real star doctor for nowadays parents) wise and concrete answers can help you, take a look: https://www.instagram.com/drbeckyatgoodinside/?hl=en"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,Idk if this is why he's doing it but when I was his age I used to hate taking pills cause of the taste. Maybe have a longer conversation with him about why he doesn't like to take his meds and calmly explain to him that it's for his own good and will only serve to make his life better. I'm 21 now and I honestly still forget to take my meds some days lol.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,I'm guessing it's like not ethical to unknowingly dose a 6 year old?  Seems like you could just trick him into taking it otherwise.  TIL.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,My ADHD and SPD kiddo can’t take pills at all. We ended up getting his meds as a patch. We put it on him in the morning and he takes it off with the nurse at school in the afternoon.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,My mum used to force imy ADHD meds down my throat. Please dont ever resort to that. I am scarred and avoid pill medication wherever possible now.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"After trying multiple forms with my 4 year old, he is finally able to take a fast acting chewable when given with a vitamin gummy in the morning and a very small starburst for other doses. Worked like a charm for us and he happily goes about his day. Your son will eventually make it part of his routine, too."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I have ADHD and custody of 2 grandsons with adhd. If you , doctor and son believe meds are the way to go then make him take them. If pills aren’t taken in our house there is punishment. No iPad or screens for a week. It’s never a problem after it happened once. Only a reminder."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Question - how is your attitude around it in the morning? Are you dreading it or apathetic or excited about it? Something I've found to work on younger kids is going in super enthusiastically.  If you're having fun, he's likely going to start having fun. You could try making it a game or a race or something, that always worked on me as a kid. 

Maybe it could be a responsibility thing too? Has he ever mixed it himself or would that even be an option? I would have hated having my meds mixed with food as a young kid but had I been given the big girl responsibility of mixing it myself and getting to make choices on what it's mixed into, I know that would have made a difference for me. Being told you HAVE to do something vs being given choices and getting to make decisions can go a long way."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I can't believe anyone is still prescribing Ritalin. But in my experience, asking follow up questions and helping the little guy explain what actually scares him might help, not to make it less scary, but to realize that the argument won't hold up. But in order to do it he has to actually talk about it instead of act, which will either be extremely challenging, or actually great for everyone as it's positive attention and one on one time versus some tantrum that benefits nobody."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,What is he scared of?
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"If you're really stuck and you are looking for something, why not validate his autonomy and allow him to make his own learning experiences to guide his future actions?

If I was it your situation and felt like I had no way forward, I would sit him down and get him to talk about the difference between when he's on his meds and when he's not, outside of the med-taking time.

Maybe engage in a creative process like asking him to list what normally happens on the days he is on meds and the days when he isn't. Or get him to make two pictures to represent the difference.

The end of this exercise is to get him to give a name to these two different types of days. They might be ""good days"" vs ""bad days"" or ""sunshine"" vs ""storms"" or ""nice days"" vs ""mean days"" or something different.

It doesn't matter as long as its relevant to him.

Label the pictures or lists appropriately, using his choice of names for them. Stick them up on a wall or a door in the house.

The next morning, ask him to choose what sort of day he wants to have today. Don't coerce him or lead him. Don't express misgivings. This is his choice, your job is to support him and to foster a positive learning environment. Ask him to point at which day he wants to have and to say the label which he assigned to the day.

If he chooses to have a good day, then tell him that he will need to take his meds to have a good day. If he changes his mind, fine.

Whatever day he has, whatever he chooses, in the most non-judgmental way ask him to talk about his day and his experiences. Allow him the space to talk it through. Do not tell him what he needs to do or push him to any conclusion.

I think that if you took this approach you would help overcome his reluctance to take medication because he would learn that the bad days are much more scary than taking medication is.

Just be patient and supportive in this process. It might take a while but this process of learning required making mistakes and developing from them. If you push him to always take his meds or if you don't provide opportunities to learn about the difference between being on meds and being off them then he might not associate taking meds with anything beyond ""*I don't like taking that pill.*"" 

On the other hand, if you help him learn about himself, he will probably arrive at the conclusion that he doesn't like taking that pill but that isn't nearly as bad as what his whole day is like when he's off his meds."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Something that worked on me when I was that age, I'm not sure what it was called, but I remember it as the illusion of choice. I would never want to go to bed on time, and I would fight every night. But as soon as my mum gave me the choice of staying up for an extra 10 minutes, I would always do it, but when the 10 minutes were up I wouldn't argue and I'd go straight to bed. 

I'm not sure if this is the exact situation but it might be worth trying, giving him the choice of taking it now or later. It worked so well on my I'm embarrassed for 6 year old me"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I would say don't be afraid to tell your children what to do. If it were me, I would just sternly say to take the pill. If there was any resistance, I would say I'm your mother and I'm telling you what to do, so take it now.

I'm off for letting children decide most things, but not all things."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Sounds like you’ve gotten tons of awesome advice already, but I was wondering if you’ve looked into Jornay PM? It’s an extended release ADHD med that kids can take before bed. It kicks in when they wake up in the morning. 

I think not all insurances cover it, but I’ve heard that it works better for some kids because it makes waking up in the morning much easier. Just something to think about!"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I have to wonder. With the stigma around these meds, do you think someone could have told him that he should be afraid of his meds? Even once?"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,My son goes to the school nurse in the mornings. He is so good with her. He likes to throw a tantrum with me. The nurse gives him his quick dissolve tablet and then he gets a sticker or other treat. Then off to class! Our mornings are so much nicer!
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Years ago Ritalin was one of the first meds I was on, around the same age as him. It gave me horrible night terrors even though it worked well. Maybe he’s not giving you the whole story about what happens at night.

I’m sure there’s newer ways to figure out what med is best, but I went through each, all the way up to trying Stratera (sp?) when it was new and I had some hefty side effects with each one. Adderal worked the best but for some reason it made me nasty. It was like people couldn’t keep up with me and I was annoyed with them. I was also a teen so 🤷‍♂️

I can’t remember if concerta was the one that made me gain weight or lose my appetite entirely. 

Also. I couldn’t swallow pills for the life of me back then so I had to take it with applesauce.

Anyway, point being, your kid is six and you may not be hearing about all his side effects."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"That is a fucked up wall of text that I can’t be assed to try to make heads or tails of, but what I will tell you is that he is 6 and Ritalin hits hard as fuck. It’s extremely unpleasant to be on-why is he prescribed Ritalin rather than Adderall?"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Your son is young and will have trouble putting words to his feelings.  Is there a reason he is resistant? You didn't mention how he takes it.  Does he have to swallow a pill?  It might be that he is scared by the process of taking the pill.  

I trained one of my kids to swallow a pill by using progressively larger candy until.we were at the size pill.she needed to swallow.

Another child had medication he needed to take, but it was tiny pieces in a capsule.  The doctor okayed opening the capsule and mixing it in something (he picked icing).  No more fuss.

When my daughter had cancer she had lots of pills to get down.  The nurses put a pill in a spoonful of applesauce. Helped so much more than I would have thought!"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,I’m not a parent myself however I remember first hand what my parents went through before deciding to try meds. It’s not an easy decision and you should never ever receive criticism for just trying to help your kid! That’s what every single parent wants to do! And I can’t express how important mental health is and that’s so so so so so so so so amazing that lots of parents remember that mental health is just as important as physical health.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"It might be a good idea to try him on different medications. Each one acts differently for each person. Some people praise adderall but it truely made me scared. I felt like a robot and that I was robbed of all agency and emotion. Medication takes a long time to get it right, but it's really important that you do.

When you're 6, you don't have the vocabulary to really explain those kind of feelings. It just comes out as ""I'm scared."" I don't know exactly what your son feels, but there are some red flags in this situation that might indicate ritalin might not be the best fit."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I am sure there is good, kind advice here but I was skimming the post and read ""for the attention"" and barfed."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,[deleted]
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I'm soon 29 and I hate taking my pills because they change who I am. They make me a more stable person, yes. But it's not the ""real"" me. Maybe that's a legit fear for him as well?"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,My son hated the taste of Adderall capsule medicine mixed with yogurt so dealt with all kinds of delays and excuses — recently switch to Vyvanse chewables (didn’t even know they existed!) and this has been an amazing improvement.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Please try to figure out what’s behind that and take it serious! I’ve been one of the kids who were forced to take their adhd medication. 
Sure they improved my grades, I noticed that I was better in school, I got more done but they made me so miserable that just the thought of taking them made me wanna cry.

I was too young (and scared) to articulate what was wrong. I didn’t feel like myself in a very bad way. Physically there were no abnormal symptoms in the beginning, so my parents and doctors said I just don’t like taking pills. But mentally it was torture, I felt shut into my own brain, not able to communicate, not able to move, desperately trying to reach out but not able to.

The only way I was able to do express I didn’t like them was to refuse taking them. The doctors said that it’s just a phase and I am rebellious, and refused to switch my medication. After years I went to a new psychiatrist and got prescribed something else that worked and didn’t put me through that torture.

So please, take it serious and try to figure out if there’s more behind it!"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"My son is about to turn seven and has just started on Concerta (Ritalin-methylphenidate) also. We also did over a year of therapy and trying other steps before we went to Concerta. Honestly I’m happy to see another parent who can relate- it’s not an easy decision. All I can say is how positive it has been in the short two weeks for my son, but he struggles so bad with sleeping (it was already an issue before). Here’s to hoping our kiddos settle into the routine and everything ends up working out for the best ❤️"

Getting my son to take his Ritalin,Hide it in cheeseburgers
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,How about don't drug your child? Maybe? I'm permenantly disabled from my parents choice to make their lives easier to deal with my beheivhour. Its fucking abelist to drug people because you are inconvenienced.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,Oh wow this is amazing and explains SO much thank you for this comment
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,Thank you!  I will look this up and ask his therapist about it.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,Thank you for this. That makes alot of sense. I would often start trying to develop routines but would find it easy at first and then it would get harder to the point where I just gave up. I have noticed I don't have that issue as much since starting treatment.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I have tried taking my meds with him and he is also taking it with applesauce already.  We tried letting him choose whatever he wanted to take it with (applesauce, yogurt, pudding, whipped cream) and the result is the same."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,My kid takes their concerta with applesauce. 12 y/o and has a verrrry hard time swallowing pills
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,Maybe!  Thanks!
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,I used to do this when I did therapy with kids! Still do it with adults sometimes too lol.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,This. I decided a few days ago I wanted to be a part of society again so I'm back on ritalin. It doesn't matter how much your parents tried to shield you when you're alone you're *alone*.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I want to add that part of all of the “I don’t need them today” is wanting to make your own decisions/stubbornness. I was always afraid my parents would make fun of me once (“see, that wasn’t that hard”) once I gave in. And I also knew my bad behavior was expected. It might help to give him an out - ie tell him if you don’t want to fuss about this you don’t have to and I won’t say anything - you know this medicine helps you. Then leave the room and let him eat it on his own when he thinks you can’t see him."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,Well if you take a stimulant like adderall then is a good idea to take breaks.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Let him fail school and assume consequences when he is little. It's still low risk at this age, and would have more consequences later."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"All of this.  We’re now taking things away when he acts out about it (slamming doors, throwing things, hitting).  Sometimes it works for a day or two and then we’re back to where we started, or worse."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,We’ve sort of done this. My only worry with this approach (which I will still consider!) is that the bad behavior can be so extreme.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I think it would add a struggle to the day because he wouldn’t want to be done doing the fun thing.  The threat of not going to school seems to help but not quickly. Today, after I called school to say he would be late or absent, he was not happy and ended up taking it, but it was still a good five or ten minutes of acting like he was going to take it and then turning away."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,My parents “snuck” meds with yogurt but I always knew what was going on
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"My guess is that the struggle is actually related to going to school- it seems like when he finally takes it is when he has to go to school, so maybe he associates the two things and that’s what he’s fighting. So maybe addressing that would help as well"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"“No bike without helmet!”

Me: *chuckles in Dutch*"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,I feel like we have been doing this but maybe not as thoroughly as we can. I will try to better keep this in mind.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I think we’ve gotten a good handle on the afternoon crash.  It was bad at first but we haven’t had a problem with it in a couple of weeks.  When he starts to seem cranky, we will have a dance party or play a game or something.  The problem now seems to be in the morning before he takes it."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,Thank you!
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,I never thought of that!  Thanks!
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"This could be a good idea, but I also feel like it might be sort of giving him what he wants.  And his bad days are SO bad that I just can’t send him to school like that.  We’re talking destruction of property, trying to literally run away from school, kicking another student.  After the storm has passed, he can reflect on it and make the connection, but it doesn’t seem to hold."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"He sort of has a choice of when to take it in the morning but I haven’t been waking him up earlier than is necessary.  He also hasn’t ended up missing school yet.  Since we live so close, he can fight it for quite a while before it’s too late.  I haven’t wanted him to miss school unless he absolutely has to since he already leaves early at least once a week for therapy, but maybe I need to do that if he doesn’t take it by an earlier designated time?"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,I’ve talked with his doctor about the chewable but he didn’t think it was a good idea to switch (yet) because what he’s on is working so we’ll once he takes it. Do you have any idea what they taste like?  Maybe it’s worth switching if it tastes good.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Since he has to take it mixed with food, we can’t have the nurse administer his medication.  It might be an option when/if he learns to swallow the capsule."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,I love this. Make it fun and playful instead of scary or high stakes.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,We have tried so many bribes.  They’ll work for a day or two and then he’s over it.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"It’s…. Really not that deep. Meds feel weird in the mouth, especially during childhood, and the idea of swallowing pills is icky and uncomfortable.

We forget as adults what it was like to be a child"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Yes to pretty much all of this.  His therapist’s first diagnosis when we started was anxiety and I will be speaking tomorrow with the psychologist who did his full testing. Oddly, he takes it best with applesauce even when we’ve offered what I would consider way better options.  And he has choked.  That is why we first started mixing with food, but then he occasionally holds it in his mouth until the taste makes him gag.  He seems to understand that if he swallows it immediately, it’s not so bad, so I’ve thought of it as more of a defiance thing.  Maybe I was way off.  Thanks!"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,Thank you!
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"He actually could write himself a note!  With help for spelling, he likes writing people notes.  But maybe that’s something he would like. Thanks!"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,I have no experience with patches.  Do they come off easily?   That would be my primary concern with something like that.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"He does have a 504 plan with accommodations, but I had not thought of adding something like that.  I will ask the principal if that’s a possible accommodation. Thanks!"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Hey just wanted to point out you have essentially just described motivational interviewing, one of the most effective interventions for behavior change. It's very popular in areas like substance use recovery and throughout social work with adults and children. I say this is good advice."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Honestly, I don’t feel comfortable sending him to school without taking it after some of the meltdowns he’s had there.  For his safety and everyone else’s.  He has tried to run from school, he has tried to trash the classroom, kicked other students, kicked an aid.  Thankfully, his school is amazing and they’ve been nothing but supportive and helpful, but before he was on it, I spent all day while he was at school with my phone attached to my hand and constantly stressing because I was just waiting for the call."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Thank you!  I’m sorry you had to deal with that.  He doesn’t take it at school and I don’t think the other kids know about it, so I would be surprised if that was a factor. I will ask him, though.  That’s an angle I hadn’t thought of."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"We did switch to taking them everyday and not just school days.  And I give him as much choice as I feel like I can for when to take it.  I make him have breakfast first, but then he has until 7:45 to get dressed and take his meds.  Once that’s done, he can play games or watch tv or something."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,Thank you!
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Thank you so much.  I think we’ve got a pretty good handle on the crash.  It was bad for the first few weeks but it has been much better since.  When he starts to feel/seem cranky, we have a dance party or watch some YouTube or play a game.  The past few weeks he has seemed to be more conscious of it himself"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"My mother would do similar things with me when I was little/young, when I had a meltdown. The behaviour would be completely ignored and I’d be removed until I was able to calm down enough to communicate what was going on. Mum would put me in my room, and that’s where I would stay. (I didn’t know it at the time, but she was always just outside my room waiting). I would throw and break things in my room, and you know what the consequences were? I didn’t have that thing I broke anymore. Another strategy Mum would use, and it wasn’t until recently in the past couple of years that we found out what the correct terminology for it was, and my psychologist was able to confirm Mum did the right thing purely on instinct. My emotions would become so big and overwhelming, that I would dissociate. My emotions, usually anger, would just get so out of control that I’d literally be blackout mad. This was when the kicking and biting would happen to Mum. The only way she could get me to calm down would be to put me in a cold shower, clothes and all. She’d literally pick me up and have to carry me like a football to the bathroom, put me in the shower and turn the cold water on. Within 5 minutes I’d be “back” and calmed down. It’s a strategy that still works for me now at 26, when my emotions are getting overwhelming or I’m triggered into a panic attack. My psychologist explained that, whilst at the extreme end of the spectrum of options, a cold shower is great for bringing me back down from that kind of elevation as the cold water shocks my nervous system and triggers regulation. It can also be done by rubbing ice on your face, sticking your face in a bowl of cold water, or by running the inside your wrists under cold water. The shower is just what’s worked for me personally, both as a child and adult. Now, if my elevation levels are less severe, running cold water on my wrists or using cold water in a bowl also works just fine. Simply depends on where I’m at and how heightened my emotions/behaviour is. 

As an adult who was only able to take medication in the past 2 years, and having a much younger brother who was diagnosed early and been on medication early, I very much wish I’d been diagnosed sooner and had the option of medication sooner. My schooling and behaviour would have been so so different if I had the options your son does.

Keep doing what you’re doing, please don’t give up on the medication. Continue to validate his emotions, but perhaps also try not making it *such* a big deal regarding the time for medication. Don’t argue with him about whether or not he takes it. Tell him, and I mean, *tell him*, that it’s time for him to take his tablet/eat his applesauce. If he doesn’t, repeat that it’s time for him to eat his applesauce, and if he doesn’t, you walk away and the morning routine doesn’t progress. No video games with Dad, no shopping with Mum, no school. Hell, no brushing his teeth or putting shoes on until he takes his tablet. You are the parent, he is 6. At his age, as many people have pointed out, he’s not able to comprehend the whole cause vs. effect of it all. His choices are he eats his applesauce or Mum walks away and nothing else happens in the house. Stay strong Mama. You are doing what’s best for his quality of life. Good luck!"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Unfortunately, no."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,Thank you!  Sometimes I really need to hear that
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,Thank you!
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,Tha k you!
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"He won’t give a reason for being scared.  It is something he says whenever he wants to get out of something. Even though I can usually tell when he is genuinely scared and when he’s faking, I always ask him to tell me.  So far he just doesn’t give me any reason other than, “I’m just scared.” And a lot of the time, he’s laughing."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,He doesn’t give us any details
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,Thank you!  And I’m so glad things are getting better for you and your son!
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,Thanks!  I will talk about med options at his next follow up
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,He won’t give us any responses beyond “I’m scared” and “I don’t know.”  I wish I could get him to open up more or figure out how to vocalize what he is feeling.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Yes, we ask every day.  His therapist always asks, too.  We came up with an idea in therapy today of taking it in the morning as soon as he wakes up instead of after breakfast and he seemed really confident that that will work so 🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I’m sorry, but that last line! In my head I read it in the most deadpan, Aubrey Plaza-like facial expression and voice and it just cracked me up 😂😂"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"He actually gets *more* one on one time if he takes it since we can do certain activities.  There’s a video game that he was asking for for a long time and my husband finally got it for them to play together.  He loves it. If he takes his medication on time in the morning, they play it together before school and he gets time on it after school.  When he has a calm evening, we have more time together for stories before bed. He gets to go shopping with me, things like that.  So his tantrums end up costing him one on one time. He gets warnings so he knows what’s on the line but it doesn’t seem to click until it’s too late.

Edit to add:  it literally costs us time, I’m not just taking away time together.  We’ll spend thirty minutes trying to get one thing done and then we’re just out of time for other things."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"He takes it in applesauce already.  We’ve tried pudding, yogurt, offered whipped cream.  Applesauce seems to work best but it’s still a battle."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"This is not a decision we made lightly. We were hesitant to start meds but it was legitimately a safety issue for himself and others.  We finally sat down and went over pros and cons and this truly, when he takes it, improves his quality of life.  We asked him, too.  Before we made the decision, I said, “If there was a medicine that could help you focus and control your choices, would you want to take it?”  He said yes immediately.  And this was after six months of therapy and learning different ways to calm down and control himself, how to stop and make good choices.  Nothing else was working."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"i wasn’t medicated as a child either, but as soon as i got my hands on ritalin, i was snorting them. same with any other adhd med i could find. i don’t recommend putting children on amphetamines or amphetamine derivatives because to this day i still get sweaty thinking about it. the comedowns are very, very hard.

in the end, it’s OPs choice."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,We didn’t rush into the decision to put him on meds.  It truly was a matter of safety and his quality of life.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Because they have a developmental executive functioning disorder, and this is the preferred treatment proscribed by a doctor. There are about 80 years of studies proving the safety and effectiveness of these medications in these situations."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"We tried everything until we decided this was the best option.  I was very hesitant to put him on medication but truthfully, it became a safety issue and his quality of life is better when he is on it.  His school has been amazing and I can’t imagine a better team to work with us."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder, and current evidence shows that treating a child's ADHD with stimulants actually helps their brain development."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,We mix it with food instead of having him swallow the capsule. We tried having him swallow the capsule for the first few days and then I told the doctor I felt like I was traumatizing him and just could not make him do that. We were given the ok to mix with food and that’s how he’s taken it fiancé that second week.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,We open the capsule and mix it with food.  We gave up on swallowing the pill after a few days.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,Maybe?  I try to get him to eat first since it suppresses his appetite.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,His doctor said that Vyvanse may be an option in the future but that the insurance companies don’t like to cover it since there is no generic yet.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,We mix it with applesauce. We gave up on him swallowing a pill after the first few days.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,Thank you!  I will ask about this at his next follow up.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"We talk about it frequently before and after.  The trouble is after he takes it, he says it’s good and helps but before, he fights it."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I’m sorry that happened to you.  There is no one telling him not to take it.  It’s just me, dad, and baby bro at home and anyone else he has contact with is supportive.  And he’s also never alone with anyone else that would/could influence him that way."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"It starts very positive and the longer it goes on, the more likely I am to get stern or “use my mean voice” as he says.  I try so hard to remain calm and not give him the reactions he’s looking for, but I’m also human.  There is always praise when he finally takes it."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"No idea.  He doesn’t say anything more than that, but he laughs about it which makes me think it’s for attention rather than an actual fear.  I always ask, though.  I don’t want to brush it off even if I’m sure I know his intention."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I haven't heard of this, but I will definitely ask at his next follow up!  Thanks!"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,I don’t think so.  The only people who know him and know he’s on them are all very supportive.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,We gave up on swallowing pills after a few days because I felt like I was just traumatizing him.  We were given the ok to open the capsule and mix it with food so he now takes it with applesauce.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,We started giving our son a melatonin gummy about a half hour before bed and it seems to help him get to sleep.  Good luck!  I hope it gets better.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Just want to let you know that Ritalin becomes inactive if taken with vitamin C, so store bought apple sauce probably isn't your best choice since most brands add vit C. I take Ritalin and I notice a huge difference when I avoid fruit and veggies until lunch."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,These meds also taste terrible so maybe thats what the meltdown is about
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I did something similar for my son when he started epic tantrums before swim class. Which he loved once he was actually there. I “interviewed” him after, filmed it with my phone, basically asked him to reassure his future self that it was FUN. I think I only had to show him the video twice in the following weeks. 

There is also the possibility that he is dreading a side effect and can’t put it into words yet. But I’m sure you’ve thought of that already. Best of luck, I hope he calms down soon!"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,This post isn’t talking about med holidays though… it’s about how when you want/need to be taking it and you somehow trick yourself into thinking you don’t.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I dunno. If you get pushed into special education at a young age when you shouldn’t be there, it can be damning."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"“When you reach rock bottom, the only way to go is up” © Fight Club. A somewhat radical mentality, but worth a shot if nothing else works, I agree."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Ok, so I am a parent, but my son is too young to even be diagnosed with ADHD.  I'm kind of learning from you here, because I have it and it's possible that he does/will.  When my son get tantrumy about something, I just let him do it and in the end don't punish him for the tantrum itself.  It's really best to just ignore him as much as possible, as long as he isn't hurting himself/others/property.  

It sounds like he has some big BIG emotions about this and doesn't have the ability to cope with those emotions yet.  And... that seems developmentally normal.  I have some big emotions about needing medication to function normally, and I'm over 40!  Once he's in a more calm state, you or the therapist can talk to him about strategies for dealing with those big emotions in a more productive and less distressing way.  But for now as long as he does take it, focus on that as the positive.  And pay as little attention to tantrums as safely possible."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,Yeah i can understand that. I hope you find a plan that works. Strong willed children are wonderfully infuriating lol
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Is it possible to find a fun thing with a built-in time limit?  My son and I do ""15 minute challenges"" in minecraft, just like the youtubers do!  And if you take longer than 15 minutes, you lose... obviously. 

It sounds like he generally responds well to natural consequences.  I would say start making that call to the school earlier before it gets right to the run up to having to leave.  Call them back if you have to.  What is his alternative activity for the day if he doesn't go to school? Does he know what it is, and does he like/dislike that idea?"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"5-10 minutes of waiting him out isn’t actually that bad.  Can y’all get up 10 minutes earlier to account for the time it takes to accept meds? Honestly I’d just let him be a pill if he’s going to take it anyway. The follow-through will eventually lead to less challenging behavior. 

The other idea I have (can be used in combo) if he’s motivated to please his teachers, could you send him to school with a positive note when he’s taken his meds? Teacher may be willing to offer some reward for that. Connecting school and home environments this way can be very useful.

Get a vitamin and take your “meds” together. Feed a pill to a puppet. Race. Gamifying is also super helpful.

None of these things should be used as a means to cajole. You have to set him up beforehand with the expectations, before he loses it.

(Source: board certified behavior analyst with 14 years experience dealing with stuff like this.)"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,My guess is that he associates fighting it with putting off going to school- it seems like once he takes it it’s time to go. Maybe it’s more that he doesn’t want to go to school. I wonder if there’s a way to make the two things less associated so taking meds =\= instantly having to go to school?
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Yeah, it’s the sneaking into random different foods that breeds distrust."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,I’d definitely talk that out too! I think the fear piece is what he’s expressing but at six you can totally ask about if skipping school is an element
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"It’s so hard I read and re-read all the Janet Lansbury blogs and books books because while saying it a certain way doesn’t really seem to matter to my kid it completely affects how well I present the boundary. 

You got this! When he was little I told myself it took saying ‘I won’t let you’ 100 times for a boundary to take. Really it’s less than that but in my experience so far it’s unlikely to be a quick fix"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,Ah I see. I'm not sure why that would be then. Sorry I couldn't help
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Good luck with it. 

And random side thought: does he have a weighted blanket?

When the world feels like a disco lights are flashing & 20 people are crowding round me all talking loudly at the same time, and sirens are blaring (I call it “my brain, unmedicated”)…

…at times like that, hiding under my weighted blanket is the only thing that brings me back down. 

Well, alcohol also helps - but that’s probably not a good recommendation for a child :-)"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"He doesn't know what he wants except in immediate terms, to be frank. He has little concept or experience to understand that actions taken today (to take or not take his meds) will affect tomorrow, next week, or next year. There's no frame of reference to realize he's going to be happier if he takes his meds every day. You're not going to convince a 6 year old he needs to do this thing.

But you can engineer situations to make him chose to take the meds himself. 

If the idea I gave before just doesn't work, sit down with your team and come up with ideas. Maybe make it a game, play a quick card game every morning so his attention is on that and causally pass his pill and drink in between ""go fish"" and ""your turn"" and make the pill just a side thing that happens instead of a main event.

Giving safe control is best, to teach him self control skills, bit if it doesn't work, set that aside for a future lesson and get creative."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I don’t think what he wants is to not take the meds, I think he wants you to beg him and bribe him. You are focusing on him and giving him attention. I have a very stubborn son, and the best thing I ever did is tell him, “fine, it’s your choice. Here are the consequences of that choice. If you change your mind let me know and I’ll help you if you need it.” It did not work right away, when he realized that I wasn’t going to play his game he would say he was ready to do whatever it was I needed him to do, and then start his game all over again and I would reply the same way. It took a while but eventually he realized that he wasn’t going to get attention that way."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I was on it briefly when I was in first or second grade, and what my parents would do was put it in a small spoonful of brown sugar. They even had the school do this"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,Giving him what he wants isn't a bad thing.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Yeah, he sounds like natural consequences are his main motivator.  You can make that call to the school earlier.  They honestly would prefer to know if a student won't be there earlier than the last minute anyway, so it's not like you have no reason to do that.  Talk to his homeroom teacher and find out what time \*she\* would like to know for the day, and then use that time."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Well the chewable methylphenidate is literally the same drug, but the vyvanse would be a bit different.  My son used to take the chewable vyvanse.  He said they tasted good. They smell like strawberry bannana?  I'm not sure about the other one though.  And, I'd say that if he's resistant to *taking* it, it's not actually working that well.  Having a positive experience is super important."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,So tough!
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I’m sure you’ve already looked into this, but have you asked the school and school nurse if they are able to give it in applesauce? Apple sauce is a really common way to give meds, I’m currently a nursing student and every med cart I have seen has applesauce on it. It’s not used frequently, but it’s always an option.  If apple sauce supply or cost is an issue, would the school be able to do it if you provided the apple sauce?"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I saw you mentioned it has a bit of a taste -- it may be worth trying the chewables. Sensory issues are a complicated thing with ADHD but, though they aren't like ASD, they do seem to exist. It could be this taste it **so unpleasant** it's just kinda kicking on executive function problems (I think at age 6 just eating is probably enough). Giving it to him in basically candy form may be the way to get it done

&#x200B;

Just a quick example, and a sign of how easy it is for kids to accidentally hide how bad sensory issues are: I went vegetarian in 7th grade. Partly this is because *I really can't stand a lot of meat.* I liked... steak and bbq pulled pork and sesame/teriyaki/honey/whatever chicken. Ground beef was enemy #1. I hated it. My mom would make chili frequently, or we would have this basically taco salad things, and ground beef was in both. I would do **everything I could** to eat around it. My mom would notice and eventually I would have to eat some of it. Now, she knew I didn't like it. What I don't think she realized is that I was so nauseated by it I would **gag.** Like actually gag. This was 100% involuntary -- something about the smell and taste and texture just does NOT vibe with my brain. I don't even like beyond meat things. But I would start trying to find some ways to eat this without actually throwing up a bit in my mouth. I used to just save it all to the end, but I found that was unbearable because then I had to eat it all alone. So then I would eat it first, but I would almost be too sick to enjoy other parts of the food. I would **cover** it in cheese to hide the flavor but still I would gag. My mom had no clue, because to me saying ""I don't like \_\_\_"" would imply that obviously I was gagging while eating it because that was just what happened with foods that I thought were supposed to be classified under those words."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Shit, I’m a 32 year old woman who has to take gummy vitamins because thinking about taking pills makes me have nausea and a little anxiety. I’m glad adderall is tiny because otherwise I don’t know how I would function!"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I was going to ask about the choking issue, since I have a lot of sensory problems and when I was younger I recall my parents struggling to help me learn to swallow a pill, but I always gagged when trying to ""put it on the back of my tongue"" as they did prior to taking a drink of water.  

What I do is take a big swig of water, tilt my head back, drop in the pills, and just swallow before the pills have a chance to set off my gag reflex.  Might sound weird but it's the only method I found that has been a good workaround.   

Not that I can say what's appropriate or not, but I was taking Adzenys for a few months and it was the one that dissolves under your tongue.  not a bad taste, nothing too weird, really kicks in fast, and was similar to a standard extended release medication to me.  No risks of choking on a pill when it's dissolved in your mouth instead."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,Have you noticed that his anxiety worsens with the Ritalin? When I was first diagnosed as an adult Ritalin was the first meds I took. They work really well but they severely worsened my anxiety. Maybe there is a side effect that he’s experiencing that you might not be picking up on?
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"No worries! I've been told, and read from my medical journal, that the months following my first medication (2-3 months) were the first time my parents were able to breathe out.

I was definitely a problem maker as a child, and it probably won't be easy. But you'll manage fine.

 I turned out great in the end, after a roller coaster and a half."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"You’re welcome! I see a lot of people encouraging punishment/reward systems which never worked for me, so I wanted to suggest something that could actually develop trust with himself and with you. Learning to trust yourself is a huge problem for adhd folks because it feels like we’re fighting with our brains (and often losing), so I hope this helps! 

Would love an update on if this works, if you try it!"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I didn’t have concerta patches but I had had birth control patches. They stick on well for the week, depending on where you put them (like will fabric be rubbing it) and how much you sweat there. They are UGLY (mine at least where this beige color) so maybe letting him decorate the outside (it won’t affect the medication) would be fun!"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Damn. That might be something more serious than adhd, or if it isn't, we need to start getting some more specific diagnoses for all the various types of people and problems under the adhd banner. I hope the rest might be if some use to you, though, and if not, maybe get a second opinion? Like, hey doc, don't worry about scaring me with a scary sounding diagnosis, I need to know exactly what is going on with my kid so I can give him the best treatment and life possible."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Good to everyday on the meds.

This might be hard to communicate well over reddit but I'm going to give it a shot.

You might be giving him too loose of boundaries. It's a really weird balance. Too little freedom and shut down, too wide of a boundary and he might have 'executive dysfunction paralysis'.

I'll use my bedtime as an example. If I tell myself, ""Okay, we're going to bedtime at 10pm"" it feels too restrictive. What if, I'm in the middle of something in my game or in the middle of a really good episode of something. And I'll ignore it. It's too restrictive.

On the flip side, if I tell myself, ""I'll go to bed when I'm tired"" I might stay up until 3am because I wasn't tired enough to stop what I was doing to go to bed. But the thing is, I get up at 6:30 and I need 7-8 hours of sleep to function properly. And my brain is VERY good at convincing myself that I don't need 7-8 hours of sleep and that staying up this late is worth watching the t.v. episode or getting farther along on my current project/video game. The thing is, IT NEVER IS WORTH IT. It's too vague.

So what is the middle? I am not allowed to start a new episode of the t.v. show in the living room after 9pm. If the last episode ends at 9:01pm. I need to go get ready for bed, take my melatonin. Then I can do whatever in bed, read a book, scroll through social media, switch or whatever. Being in bed and the melatonin trigger me to close my eyes and my brain goes, ""you're already in bed. Just close our eyes"" and then I go to sleep. If I was out in the living room, my brain wouldn't let me fall asleep and would also make it harder to get up and get ready for bed.

It might be a better approach to give him two options each day and them come up with a consequence for when he picks one option and doesn't follow through. But have him come up with the consequence and talk through it. We end up having to do this with screentime/movies on friday night. Last weekend, we talked about how we were going to watch one movie. That at the end we had to do these 3 things. That we were allowed to be sad the movie was over but throwing a full out kicking/screaming tantrum wasn't okay and if that happened we would lose screen time for the next day. Kid(4) agreed to it, says she understood. And then meltdown at the end of the movie. We got her to bed, then the next day when she asked to watch an episode of something, we talked to her why she didn't get screen time for today and what we could do next time to ensure that doesn't happen.

So what that could look like for him is this.

""Buddy, we need to take our meds. It's not an option if we take them or not. Would you like to take them before or after breakfast? After? Okay, if you decide you don't want to take them after breakfast, what will happen? Because we need to take our meds.""

If he answers with an, ""I don't know"" follow it up with a reasonable consequence. ""Then tomorrow, you won't get an option of when to take your meds. I will have to tell you when it's time to take them."" or ""You will need to sit here until you're ready to take your meds, which means if it takes long enough you won't be able to do X before school."" or "" we will have to wake up earlier as it takes an extra 10 minutes for you to be ready to take your meds""

I will also say if he answers your question of, before/after breakfast. Ask him when he wants to take them? If he gives you an unacceptable answer, instead of saying, ""no"" ask him how that would work. ""Oh you want to take them after you get dressed. We tried that today, how did that go?"" ""Do you think that worked?"" ""Okay we'll try it again tomorrow and if it doesn't then we need to do X or Y.""

I realize this is a lot but hopefully one of these options will help."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Can I ask you, how did you potty train him when he was younger?  Whatever kind of thing worked then will work best now.  My son didn't take to rewards like candy or any punishments that he saw as coming from us (his parents) rather than from the world in general.  Had to let him pee in the car or at the train station a couple times before he learned that fun is done and we have to go home to change.  (Got the idea not to change him till we got home from one of his daycare instructors.  You gotta let them feel the consequences a little and miss out on fun a little.  It won't hurt them to be wet for a few minutes.)

Anyway, I said earlier to ask his homeroom teacher for an earlier deadline that she will help you back up. e.g. She won't know how many books or papers to put out if she doesn't know by XYZ time before school whether or not he's coming.  Any little thing is fine, it just needs to be a reason outside of punishments or rewards.  Then also ask the school to \*send him home\* if he starts acting out. Work with them to set a policy on this, so if he ever decides to go in without it, he immediately experiences a consequence from the world... not from you."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Crud I’m sorry. I’m out of ideas, bribery is all I know. Maybe extra cuddling?"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Second this, you'rea good mom! We're in a similar position, but mine is 14 and the meds make him nauseous lately. We'll see the doc in a week, but in the meantime he's gotta function in school, so he's gotta take at least one adderall/day to get through most of the school day. I hate making him take it, he hates taking it, but we must, at least for now."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Could you ask the school counselor to talk to him to see if he’s willing to open up to others about it?

Your doing the best you can . Go easy on yourself"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,That is so hard. Hang in there! The effort is worth it.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Except he's only six so the cause and effect thing probably isn't solid with him and won't be until teens or maybe even late twenties when our prefrontal cortexes are more developed. He might only perceive when people are mad at him or not which could be triggering more control seeking behaviors.

Are there more active one-on-one activities that could be incorporated? The meds will work better if he gets some exercise, esp in the morning."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Yeah but he KNOWS that. Have you tried a form where he doesn't know? 

Also I saw in another comment that he's losing privileges for acting out. People with ADHD cannot control it and punishments make it worse. Maybe switch to positive reinforcement instead, and ignore the bad behavior (like legit ignore it, but shower him with praise when he gets it right)."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,How does the pill make the food taste?
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,That doesn't mean they won't cover it. Usually you have to have the doc write a note saying not to substitute. It's definitely worth trying. Plus the company has a couple ways to reduce the cost. It seems worth trying rather than power struggling over pill delivery.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"That's all that matters then. 

Without meds my mind is a mess and is hard to think straight, all that matters is now because anything in the future would require a organized train of thought, and enough focus to evaluate consequences. For a kid that must be harder. And testing people limits, or trying to get away with things is more stimulating than getting ready for school."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,What does he say when you ask why he’s scared or what he’s scared of?
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Thank you!! We’ve been doing a Luna vitamin with 0.5mg of melatonin, but I think it might be time to increase to 1mg dosage. Gotta call his pediatrician today and see."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,I didn’t know this!  I will check the nutrition facts.  Thanks!
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,I'm shook. I'm rethinking my whole life right now. Do you know if it affects extended release meds differently?
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,Thanks!
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I actually wonder if this sorta practice could be used more for people (specifically younger people) who struggle with specific mental illnesses? I have some friends who just randomly stop taking their medications and suddenly dip into severe depressive episodes and it gets really worrying at times. Of course I understand that for some, medications can cause issues if not moderated properly or prescribed correctly, but I wonder how much easier it would be for people with serious mental health problems if they were to sort of “record” how they feel while on medications, both good and bad feelings, and how it could even help medical professionals to figure out how to better help those people?"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Not to get all dark, but I did this technique once as an adult - I recorded a video on my webcam talking through how awful my (ex)boyfriend was. We were in an abuse cycle and I needed a way to communicate with future me to remind her that things are *not okay*, even if it seems like things are getting better. It was surprisingly effective - I never even needed to rewatch the video, it’s mere existence was enough! Pretty sure it was shortly before I finally ended the relationship for good. So definitely a good technique for kids, but also even adults!"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"As an adhd adult, there’s two things that go into my own hesitations: I have a hard time describing feelings with my own words, and it’s difficult to genuinely consider consequences or cause/effects. 

When you’re young or inexperienced, it’s hard to describe “i don’t want to do this because I can’t slowly build my skills and these are all experiences that have so many THINGS happening (swimming in a class, being aware of social situations while medicated, etc)” as anything other than “I am scared and don’t wanna”. 

When you have a tough time connecting that you enjoy yourself after doing the thing you’re concerned about, it’s even harder to build confidence and trust. It can take a while, but finding an external source that you trust might do the trick (like a video of yourself or a parent’s reassurance). 

If the current “fix” isn’t sustainable (i.e. taking all morning to test a parent’s reassurances), finding a new trusted source of motivation and encouragement could make things easier. Sometimes it’s just people learning to do things quickly to avoid punishment, but sometimes it looks like someone learning to explore their feelings and rely on their own experiences and desires. 

**adhd tl;dr**: it’s hard to describe complicated, unique experiences. when you can’t judge things yourself, use (sustainable) external motivators until it’s okay."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"This is a great idea, my kid always stresses about doing something new but always likes it really much. Gonne try it out!"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,I guess I never understood that struggle but I guess it’s easy to overthink things.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Thrue, lettings it go to is point is not a good idea. Bur I have seen parents make the schools bag of their children every day because if the child forget something they are punishef by the school. That doesn't really teach independance. If that happens pne or two time that can make them less forgetful, or  if that happens every time that can reveal a bigger problem. 
In OP case that could make the child realise that not taking his med have consequences and that he have to make a choice."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"We try to just let him work himself out but we frequently have to step in because he gets violent and destructive.  Even in those situations, I try to interfere as little as possible. We talk after he’s worked through it, read books about handling big emotions, we speak with his therapist.  He doesn’t seem to be able to access any calming techniques in the moment."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"So far he hasn’t actually had to miss school (other than being sent home early).  He ends up taking it at the last possible moment to get there on time.  When he’s had to come home early, it’s no screen time, loss of things we might have been planning to go do (he likes to go to the store with me), losing particular toys or activities.  He will acknowledge that he made bad choices and be remorseful but it doesn’t stay with him the next day."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"The whole process of getting him to take it sometimes takes up to an hour.  Today, that ten minutes was just the time it took after I finally called school.  We have set the same expectations daily, we talk about it at night and in the morning.  We try to keep to a schedule and routine so that he knows what to expect and when."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,He does like going to school and he gets upset if I say I’m going to call him in late or absent.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,We bought one when he was littler but he never really used it much.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,Thank you!
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,What if you put it in a high interest food? Would the desire to have it override the fear?
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,He does take it with applesauce.  He has to take it at home because the capsule is opened and that way he can take it early enough to kick in by the start of the school day.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"This is exactly how I take pills, too! If I do it right, I have no trouble taking even very large pills. But if it touches the inside of my mouth at all, I will have a ton of trouble swallowing it. I'm actually glad to hear I'm not the only one who does this, lol.

I tried adzenys, too, and it was pretty good for me. Vyvanse is my favorite, though, and that's what I take now."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,It actually seems better.  He is more calm and can sit and talk about what is worrying him and I think that helps.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"We had the more extensive testing almost two weeks ago and I have the follow up tomorrow.  Hopefully we will have some more answers.  One thing we’ve considered is possible ODD, so we will see what the psychologist says tomorrow."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I know this is so off topic from the main thread but as an ADHD adult your concept of a ""soft bedtime"" was just eye opening to me. I have had so much trouble getting myself to bed on time because I'm terrible at judging how long things take so aiming to be in bed at 2am exactly doesn't work. Deciding to stop what I'm doing and go to bed at 1:30 doesn't work either because like you said, what if I'm in the middle of a game or finishing a hobby project or something. But aiming for a _window_, I had never considered that before and it sounds really promising. I'm much more open to the idea of not starting anything new after 1am instead of forcibly stopping everything at 1:30. Cheers haha, I hope it works"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,I feel like we are doing this (if I’m completely understanding). But I’m going to think more closely on it and keep it in mind in the morning.  Thank you!
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"The window idea is something I stumbled across before, thanks for giving an example!!"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"We used a reward chart for potty training with dinosaurs for prizes.  Sticker charts do not seem to be motivating him for this. And they have a social worker that helps intervene when he is acting out and I get called if it’s bad. He has been sent home. The consequences just don’t seem to stick with him.  Granted, he’s six so that’s not too surprising."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,Thank you so much.  I hope things get better for your kiddo!  And I’m sure you’re doing a great job.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,He does work with the school social worker and we see a therapist once a week. Sometimes he will open up but other times not so much.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"He takes a while to wake up in the morning (very much like me, so I understand him on that) so being active first thing is pretty difficult.  But maybe waking him up earlier could help and make that possible."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Putting it in food without him knowing doesn’t work because then we can’t be sure he is actually getting it. He frequently doesn’t finish food, and even if he did, there could still be remnants in the bowl. I have to put it directly on a spoon with the applesauce. 

We’ve tried positive reinforcement,too. And as far as ignoring the acting out, we eventually have to step in when he starts literally destroying things.  Yesterday he knocked an antique framed cross-stitch off the wall of his bedroom that was a gift when he was born.  Glass shattered, he did not care at all.  I’ve started having to follow him around and grab things in his room he can throw to prevent him breaking anything he can get his hands on.  I would just not put it back, but there are things he needs in order to sleep at night (nightlight, sound machine)."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"He says Bad. The longer it sits, the worse it tastes (which he knows). We’ve tried to give it with things that will hide the taste better but for some reason, he always goes back to applesauce."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,He just says “I don’t know” or “I’m just scared.”
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,No problem! My doctor didn't explain that to me either. I never would have known if I hadn't taken pharmacology. I was taking my multivitamin in the mornings for over a year and wondering why my Ritalin sometimes didn't work.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,It’s not just vitamin c/ascorbic acid. It’s citric acid as well. Always check food labels!
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,Is he taking it after a meal. If I take meds before the peak dose is way to high and the side effects wreck me. Fats slow the digestion of some adhd medication.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,Same with extended release because the food will move through your digestive tract at the same rate as the medication and metabolize it before it can be absorbed by your body.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"My therapist advised I do something similar, along with keeping a list of the different strategies that we've tried and that I've found work for me. It's also really helped when I can't quite verbalize what feels wrong or why I'm having such a hard time doing something that I know helps, because I can take time to go through the before and after and try to narrow things down until I can find the words for it

I also go through bouts of just refusing/not wanting to eat, and the most effective way to get out of that is reminding me of how much I feel like crap, how that's linked to being hungry, and how quickly I'll feel better again when I eat

The main issue I have is just remembering to write things down, and keeping that record in a place I can see and use it easily"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,Not everyone has every symptom of any disease. It’s normal to not identify with 100% of everything.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Your logic is sound. BUT I think that’s a lot of cognitive ability to expect out of a 6 year old, with or without ADHD."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,[removed]
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Best of luck to you, I hope you figure it out!"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,We have asked what he would like and he always comes back to applesauce
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,Maybe it's worth it to have the meds kick in a little later if it's going to remove this awful battle every morning?
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Yes!  Happy to know I'm not the only weirdo doing it that way.  It works great, even a handful of huge vitamins would go down without issues most of the time.  It's very effective for those of us who have that kind of super triggered gag reflex. 

I will also say, most adults I know are doing well with Vyvanse.  I haven't tried it myself, but I also did very well on Adderall XR from my original medication process.  The other doctor I was seeing suggested the Adzenys since it has less side effects for some people, and I agree it was smoother than my Addys... but it was also backordered every month, so after a few months of having to wait additional days for the meds to arrive I got tired of that and went back to what works."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"The biggest thing that helped me is this: 

Was 'breaking' the idea that being in bed meant that I had to go to bed. It has helped for me to realize that being in bed doesn't mean it's sleep time. Because of that, I'm more likely to get up and get ready for bed because I can keep watching my show but only after I get ready for sleep. Part of getting ready for sleep is taking my melatonin and this stuff never fails. Half hour after taking it, I'm tired and just want to close my eyes. 

Last night was a great example of this working in my favor. Last night I was playing pokemon and watching T.V. When my an episode ended after 9. I told myself, ""okay, you can keep watching and playing pokemon but you have to get ready for bed"" Took my melatonin, got in bed kept watching t.v. and playing pokemon. Half hour later, I was literally falling asleep while playing. My brain wanted to keep playing but my body was, 'nope sleep'. I was already in bed. All I had to do was set the switch on the bedside and close my eyes. I was asleep by 10:45. I got 8 hours of sleep last night and feel great today. 

What used to happen was I would stay up watching t.v. or playing video games until I was literally falling asleep but without the melatonin that was closer to 11pm-12am. Then get ready for bed, then be asleep by like 1:30. I would then get 5 hours of sleep and well we all know lack of sleep makes ADHD worse."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Does he like school?? Like is that maybe part of it?? Is he just super bored in school maybe?? Or at least bored enough? I ended up doing well in K-12, like 4.0, national merit, etc. And even I, like many people on this subreddit, struggled because I was SO BORED (under stimulated) I didn’t even feel like a person. And I’m still struggling to correct that now in college. Like maybe it’s just not as much of a consequence for him"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Thank you for putting in the effort early on. I wish my parents did. My life has been terrible since they didn’t want me on meds. I didn’t get told I had adhd. It caused me so many problems, including sleeping 13 hours a day and being blamed for it. I always thought I was the problem. I almost killed myself fkr it.
Then when I was finally told and began seeking treatment ot made my life so much better, easier. But by then I had lost so much I just get upset that I lost my childhood.

You are doing the opposite for your child.

Thank you"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,Later in the day would still have a lot of carry over benefits. Have you been able to incorporate emotional regulatory activities and modeling like breathing and counting exercises?
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"*We’ve tried positive reinforcement,too. And as far as ignoring the acting out, we eventually have to step in when he starts literally destroying things.  Yesterday he knocked an antique framed cross-stitch off the wall of his bedroom that was a gift when he was born.  Glass shattered, he did not care at all.

Have you considered a shelf in his room? Put the things he needs, nightlight, sound machine, etc. out of his reach. Obviously the glass breaking is different, but if you’re having to follow him around his room to grab things before he can throw them, perhaps try having them somewhere he cannot access them. By following him around, you could potentially be feeding into the behaviour and the result may be the behaviour goes on for longer, or escalates to more severe. By having as much as possible out of reach, you’d be able to ignore the “bad” behaviour and not give it validation. Just a thought…"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Is it the tiny instant release pill?  When my first kid started medication we'd go into his room and give it to him (intact) in a spoonful of jelly.  He'd swallow it in zombie mode and usually wouldn't even remember.  We did this in the interest of time, so that he'd be awake and medicated when it was time to start the day.  He didn't eat much during the day but made up for it after school.  

My younger son likes applesauce to take his pills and can put an entire handful in there now (it's been a journey, though).  He's 12 so has had a few years to work up to it!"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,Chocolate milk in the morning? Maybe even heat it up? I am not a child psychologist and I don't have kids but it doesn't seem completely morally wrong to trick a 6 year old into taking his meds.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"That’s rough 

Keep the amount of food the right size. Too small and the meds will overpower it, too much and he’s taking too many bites of gross tasting (some things just ruin whatever they touch so in this case, you want to take a bite of normal food immediately after). 

Yeah, it’s hard. I’m sure the meds are terrible tasting but if there’s no alternative idk."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I don’t know how old this post is. But I’m on Vyvanse and you literally just crashed a window for me right now as I tried eating a banana and an apple for breakfast and struggle and feel sick and blah and so I take a multivitamin hoping that’s all I’ll need coz I have BED and sleep eat and do all my eating at night.

What do you have for breakfast?"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Question for you: (your advice is not legal medical yadda yadda, I know)

What about taking vitC capsules before bed? When I learned about vitC interfering I stopped taking it in the morning. Should I cease all together?"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I’ve seen this point about Vitamin C mentioned a few times in various places online, mostly citing one particular doctor’s patient info sheet. And some people say it only really applies to amphetamines, not Ritalin. But you said you learned it in pharmacology? Do you happen to have a reference? (Not doubting you, I’d just like to have something more solid to look at!)"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,I haven’t heard of this but I will definitely ask!
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,Thank you!
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"You could prepare it ahead of time and then he could eat it at school. There is no reason they cannot accommodate you at the school. I've had students need food with meds at school, it's absolutely a reasonable and common accommodation. Of course, if he still doesn't want to take it, that's a new issue to grapple with. I know for us, my child needed to take it like 20-30 minutes before school to start off successfully but I did put some extras at the nurse station so that if we forgot to take it, he could go there first before class."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I love how having an ADHD brain honestly feels like parenting yourself sometimes. Thanks for sharing though, I'm gonna try it tonight and I'm very optimistic!"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,I am so sorry you had to go through all of that. It breaks my heart knowing that so many kids don’t get the help they need.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Here’s something funny/ironic:  if we try to do breathing exercises with him, he refuses and says they’re stupid. But if he sees someone else getting upset or angry, he starts giving them all kinds of advice and tips on how to calm down.  “Grandpa, if you’re feeling angry, just take some deep breaths.  You can go sit on your own to calm down if you need to.”  He has a “calm down bottle” that sometimes helps, other times he will throw it, but he will offer it to his classmates if he sees someone struggling."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,It’s a bigger capsule
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,I’ve never tricked him and I would not do that.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,Peanut butter on one day?
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I used to have coffee for breakfast. Now I wait an hour most mornings. I also try to eat lunch an hour before or after my second dose. That said, I am not typical.  And when I do eat close to med time, I don’t notice an impact."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"I started taking my multivitamin at dinner. I wouldn't cut vitamin C out of your diet all together if that's what you mean, it's not harmful and it only prevents absorption of the med from your digestive tract, it won't remove already absorbed meds."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"You’re supposed to avoid vitamin C/ascorbic acid/citric acid one hour before and one hour after taking your meds. 

Always check food labels, you’d be surprised how many foods contain them."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"It’s a stomach interaction, the citric acid breaks down the methylphenidate in your stomach before it gets to your intestines where it can be absorbed.

If you take a vitamin C tablet before bed with a reasonable amount of water, it should be long gone by the time you take your meds in the morning."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"It's actually the case for many medications, Ritalin is just one of them. Acidifying agents like vitamin C (ascorbic acid) can deactivate heavily alkaline medications. Chemists usually accommodate for acidic environments within the human body (like in your stomach), but introduction of bile, differing pH levels, and personal metabolism can all interact with the intended pharmacokinetics when outside factors come into play. 

Here's the textbook that I used for that class: https://www.pearson.com/store/p/pharmacology-for-nurses-a-pathophysiologic-approach/P100003027217/9780136872849?creative=545370970254&keyword=&matchtype=&network=g&device=m&gclsrc=aw.ds&gclid=Cj0KCQiA3rKQBhCNARIsACUEW_YMAIjoXxUXkMLRtywApYa7ZA3DR9uHzqimlxRhY-C32w1NwfffKzMaAnmgEALw_wcB

It's tough to find studies specific to Ritalin since it's primarily used with children, who are a protected class and hard to do studies on, but there are studies on other meds with similar chemical structures and vitamin C. Chemotherapy meds are one that comes to mind."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Good luck ! It has a generic version and it’s NOT expensive, worth asking !"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"He can’t take it at school because the capsule has to be opened.  If it was just given whole for him to swallow, he could.  I do try to give it 45 minute to an hour before school, though, so it has time to kick in."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,Hey that means he's paying attention in those moments. Keep that up even if it's just you doing them to model so he might join in
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Hopefully some of the advice here helps you out.  You sound like a good parent, sorry you guys are going through this."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Whst do you mean, exactly?"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Thanks, that makes sense. But I would assume (knowing not much about this) that the issue is the acidity not the vitamin, right? So like, drinking orange juice or a Coke right after would be a problem. But if I have a meal-replacement shake like a Soylent or a Slim-fast that just has Vitamin C among many of the ingredients—wouldn’t that likely be okay? (I am assuming the shake is not particularly acidic, but I haven’t checked.)"
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,Thanks!
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"For future reference, school nurses are required to administer any medication needed. School nurses provide tube feedings, injections, etc. A capsule broken into applesauce is the least labor intensive medication application they do. It's nothing. Don't hesitate if that's what he needs."
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,My son's school just needed a note from his doctor saying that it's ok to mix with food. My son will only take his medicine mixed with apple juice.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,Thank you very much.
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,I honestly don't have an answer for you. That would be something to ask a pharmacist or chemist
Getting my son to take his Ritalin,"Ascorbic acid interacts with the meds, which is just another name for vitamin c :) so if you want to be on the safe side it’s best to leave some time between having the shake and your meds"

"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",I'm in Poland. It's definitely systemic factors here. The local govt is scared of amphetamines.
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Where I live they always start you on methylphenidate. If that doesn't work, you can try Elvanse. And those are basically it."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",In the netherlands ritalin is the first line medication. Only if it does not work they will try out others.
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","In Hungary the only stimulant drug for ADHD is Ritalin. But you need to visit an adhd specialist, waiting time is 2 years. Without that only available drug is atomoxetine. Eastern European dark middle ages.."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","I think in the UK methylphenidate is the first medication that is given to people, and then if that doesn’t work you can try another. 

So maybe most people just get on well with it."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","In Denmark, methylphenidate is first, after that atomoxetine or lisdexamphetamine can be tried. So yeah, public health guidelines."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",USA.  My doc started me with methylphenidate and it works like a charm.  I’m slightly curious about  Vyvance (generic) but the Methylphenidate is working so well why bother?  It’s also dirt cheap
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Vyvanse/elvanse isn't even available in France. It's concerta/ritalin or nothing
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Adderall/amphetamine salts is considered more addictive than the other classes. So it makes people reluctant both as docs and regulatory bodies.

Although both my wife and I are on amp salts and can take breaks without cravings or anything like that, just a return to ADHD deficit. So I think if it's prescribed properly that's not so much of an issue."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","In my country, there’s only two stimulants available: Concerta & Medikinet (basically Ritalin). And there’s one non-stimulant. I’m also in UE. Stimulants other than methylphenidate are not legal here"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","There is a lot of controversy surrounding amphetamine medications across the world, mainly brought on by illicit drugs of course. Some of it is understandable, as of course there is abuse potential, but imo most of it is unwarranted fear-mongering."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","NL here. Guidelines opt for medication first choice to be methylphenidate. Reason is simpler than some people might think: Proven scientific based evidence.  Yes it is older and the positives to it are that it is part of years of medical studies and it is one that is proven to be effective as well. Result is that there is a TON of science behind it. Because it is older we know more about the safety of it and the effects to the body (througout the years, however we do miss very long cohort studies, that wil come as time passes). So it in the current year of 2023 it is the first choice for effectiveness, safety and understanding. We simply know more about it and that makes it also 'safer' to prescribe it to patients."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","My doctor told me that its because Ritalin is cheaper for the government (who's paying in my country), so you start with that."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Methylphenidate has a different mechanism of action to amphetamines. Theoretically, methylphenidates are less addictive as a result of their mechanism of action. They also tend to be a bit milder than amphetamines. So, given a new patient who is have never tried any stimulant. It is reasonable to start with one that is considered less likely to lead to abuse and milder in effect to prevent side effects."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","When I used to prescribe ADHD meds I found more than half of my patients responded better to the amphetamines. Some of them had been stuck on methylphenidate for years with inadequate effect and were never tried on the amphetamines. When I switched them over to Elvanse they lit up. It was such a shame because in the meantime they’d been failing, becoming more and more depressed and insular. I worked at a private clinic and the aim was to get our patients to shared care with their GP and even though it is unsaid, sending them there with a script for Elvanse would be more likely to provoke push back due to the massive price difference. Each prescribing authority has their own formulary for ADHD meds which you can find if you dig around the internet so unfortunately, sometimes we’d have to take that into account with our prescribing decisions so if methylphenidate had some positive effect we’d stop there. Some people do respond very well to it though. 

I found also that methylphenidate can cause gastric issues in some people due to the way it is absorbed. There’s another couple of medications called Modafinil and Bupropion which were not on our formulary unfortunately and I’d liked to have tried those."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","I'm jealous of y'all, in my country all adhd medication is illegal..."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Methylphenidate is cheaper and it's said to be sufficient in 50% of cases - so it's first choice in many European countries with subsidized medical coverage.
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","I've heard that ADHD meds in general have one of the highest response rates of any medication class in general. That tells me that the amphetamine based treatments work very well, and thus probably didn't require much innovation on top of."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",In Canada my daughter was first put on Vvanse which caused her to lose weight and made her a zombie so we stopped.  We moved to the Netherlands and for the same issue she was prescribed Methylphenidate.  She had way less problems on Methylphenidate.  We stayed on it since coming back to Canada.  But I find Doctors try to talk me out using it.
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Ritalin isn’t so bad I actually prefer it to amphetamines
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","It’s both systematic and budgetary.

The NHS in my local area in Scotland treat elvanse/vyvanse as a secondary option even though it’s actually recommended as a primary option for adults who weren’t diagnosed as a child.

The patent on elvanse/vyvanse doesn’t actually expire until 2028 in the EU and UK whereas you can get generic methylphenidate."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","In Germany Elvanse is the first choice of medication for adults with ADHD. It has a fairly low potential for abuse because you can’t snort or inject it and that’s a big plus because patients with ADHD often struggle with substance abuse. But you can also add a short acting methylphenidate on top of the Elvanse. If both are not working you can get a special prescription for Amphetamin juice that a pharmacy has to produce for you, this naturally has a higher potential for abuse though and is only used when other treatments have failed. You can also get a prescription for medicinal THC. All of the above require a special narcotics prescription that is a government issued prescription that requires a diagnosis from a special doctor. But if you have the diagnosis the doctor will work with you on an individual level to find out what works best for you and assists you with getting therapy usually psychotherapy and ergo therapy are both used simultaneously. 
Buuuuuuuut: getting an appointment with such a qualified expert takes forever waiting lists are usually 1-2 years if they accept new patients at all. You could also get a private diagnosis that you have to pay for yourself but this will coast you hundreds of euros or more."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","I moved to Czechia and they grudgingly prescribe Ritalin/Concerta, although I think many physicians would prefer to start with Strattera, because fuck good patient outcomes I suppose. Neither Elvanse nor Adderall are available here.

I’ve been remotely seeing a German/American family medicine doctor who mails me a script for 3 months of Elvanse at a time, and then I drive over to Dresden to fill the script. Originally I was flying to Frankfurt and renting a car to see him in person and then fill the script the same day before flying back. So the move to telehealth has been a major improvement, even though I have to fill the script within 7 days of it being written, and it usually arrives after 5 days….

I was on a fairly high dose of Adderall for years before leaving the US. Ideally I’d still be on that, but  it’s much simpler to not fight the current more than necessary and just get the Elvanse.

So yes, there’s a definite preference towards Ritalin, its derivatives, and non-stimulants, and that’s probably almost entirely due to the stigma around anything with the word “amphetamine” in it, given how little separation there is between Adderall and Ritalin. From what I can tell though, Elvanse is available in much of northern, western, and southern Europe."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","In Estonia methylphenidate Concerta is favourable choice currently, I think but soon there should be the new treatment guidelines and Vyvanse probably will get more preferable for adults."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",I haven't looked into it too hard but it seems the EU is generally behind on ADHD treatment.
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",It's cheap.
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Methylphenidate is the first choice because it's safer for the brain, has a lower abuse potential and it's the cheapest."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Amphetamines have been demonized since the US started the war on drugs and pushed its drug policy all over the world using the UN.
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",It's cheap...
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",This is a very needed discussion. There are SO MANY people with ADHD that I am struggling to understand why is medical situation so bad around it. I am atomoxetine person - I can only function on this med. Ritalin does not do much for my emotional regulation which is my key issue.
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Here in Malta, we can't get Vyvanse and Adderall, they're not technically illegal, but the country is so small they don't import it, because its not financially viable. Though the government could pay for it, if they wanted to...as part of our free medication system.
So you got Ritalin, Concerta, Wellbutrin and Strattera basically as your only options."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",[deleted]
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","That's the backside of the coin with universal healthcare, they are bound to go for the cheapest option first even if there are better options."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Because adderall has 4x the amount of stimulant ingredients than any other med. Super strong
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","When I was first diagnosed( USA) prob… 25 ( mid 90’s)years ago, the main meds they tossed at me were Ritalin and it’s generic. I think after the 70’s- 80’s stim frenzy, doctors dialed back prescribing any of the higher addictive ones. And that caution has carried on to today. It’s why the hassle at the pharmacy"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","I was put on ritalin at first in Norway. Said it didnt work good enough for me, then tried vyvanse and now im on xr"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","I live in the states but have had a couple ""Ritalin preferred"" doctors who despise rxing amphetamines to people with ADHD that will switch everyone to that and refuse to try anything else unless it has bad side effects or does nothing."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",In the UK amphetamine is more commonly given to younger children. It’s faster acting but not as long lasting which is why phenidate is preferable for adults.
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","My prescriber recommended Ritalin as having fewer risks for pregnancy and breastfeeding (still had to stop for at least the first trimester though), too."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",I’m in Australia and Ritalin is what I’m currently taking and is my first adhd medication. It’s not working tho unfortunately. My brother was on concerta and my pdoc said that i can change vyvanse if the Ritalin doesn’t work
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","I also used Medikinet, which is same as Ritalin, and it worked pretty good"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Germany here: Elvanse hasn’t been on the market for long, especially for adults. It’s also a lot more expensive, so the usual practice is to first try methylphenidate, which was the case for me and my son. If for any reason (even „makes me feel bad when it wears off“) you can’t manage with it, your doctor can try something else which can be for example Elvanse. 
We personally prefer Elvanse,  but in my peer group there’s many people still on methylphenidate for a number of reasons."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","I’m in Germany. Amphetamines are basically illegal. I’m on Ritalin and I’ve got a lot of side effects. They don’t want to prescribe amphetamines for fear of legal repercussions, so even if a psych doesn’t have prejudices against them, then they won’t want to anyway. Here, a guy was stripped of his drivers license for life for taking Elvanse (or some amphetamine ljke that) prescribed by his doctor and driving bc even if legal, they’re still “hard drugs”. To just bring it into perspective. 

So Yh, it’s the law dragging behind research because of prejudices.

Edit: amphetamines are only prescribed if all methylphenidate based meds are not working/too many side effects and if non stimulants don’t work, so it’s far from ideal. They’re in one of those “illegal until it’s not” situations"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","I'm in Estonia and Concerta is the norm. Adderal is not available and Vyvanse costs like 150€ a month...

Non-stimulants are available afaik but I'm not sure which ones exactly."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Netherlands here. I've tried ritalin when i first got diagnosed at 22. It worked a little but after a few years i got side effects l, so i stopped. Nobody told me there were other option. Fast forward 10 years, i find out there are other options. I go to a psyciatrist she descripes me dexampetamine, but at the pharmasist I've been told that my insurance doesn't cover it, unless i try ritalin first and it doesn't work. Luckily i could get a hold of my first psyciatrist and they deliver the proof. But yeah, it is cheaper so insuranses doesn't want to pay for the more expensive drugs. For the dex, i needed to pay a lot extra myself. But it didn't work (witch was financially great), but also the long lasting variant didn't work. Right now use buproprion, it works a little, but no side effects and quite cheep so i keep using that."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Same in Hungary..
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",In my country it's literally the law that Methylphenidate is tried first.
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Pretty sure it is because of the cost and the pressure healthcare insurance puts on the doctors.

I have had to try methylphenidat for a year before my doctor let me try something else. It took 3 visits complaining about the side effects while using the lowest dosage. First time (about 5 months in, I changed doctors), ""try it a while longer, side effects may go away"". Second time ""try a different manufacturer"" and  the third time he said that now that that is over, we can explore all other options.

Only took about a year of side effects and waiting 🥲

I imagine the statistics for methylphenidat are so high because many give up on the way."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","I didn't think Adderall was a thing in Europe.  For a while (until Vyvanse/Elvanse), I thought the choices were methylphenidate and sometimes dextroamphetamine, which has a bad reputation."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Budget. At least that's what my MD told me. (In Norway btw.)
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","I started on Concerta because it’s meant to be good for AuDHD people but the titration process turned me into a zombie. I couldn’t afford to spend 2-3months working in that state, or rather not working, while I got the dose up to the right level so we switched to Elvanse. I liked Concerta though, it felt gentler"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",In canada its concerta hands down. And I've actually never met anyone here who has had a perscription for Adderall
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","In my country (czechia), you could not get ritalin or concerta if you were not diagnosed as a child until last year. You could get only atomoxetine. Now you can get it, but you have to pay for it sometimes. Which is almost 40 usd a month just to exist.

I have atomoxetine and its fully paid, fortunately."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",My psychiatrist told me that Vyvanse is actually registered here however no one sells it. Definitely a systemic issue.
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","In Poland Ritalin and Concerta (both are methylphenidate) are the only available option.

Which sucks."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Thanks for sharing, I thought it was only here!"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Ohh it’s somewhat the same here although we do have a little more options but nothing like adderall etc.
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","I second Elvanse if you have the ability. As a US resident who has taken Adderall for years, when I lived in the EU for 2 years it was the only thing that really worked for me without the option of adderall."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Same in Israel, took me three rounds of Ritalin, Concerta and Generic Concerta to be prescribed Adderall."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Seems the same
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","What if Ritalin only worked a little, like 20% improvement, will they allow you to try others like Adderall? And if Adderall didn't work can you go back to Ritalin?"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Yes and only ritalin is ensured with the basic insurance package
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Same in Germany
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Wow that’s not a lot room to hassle if you turn out non responder or with bad side effects
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Why is it 2 years? Is there a shortage of psychiatrist there?
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","I have a friend from Moldova and she said they just really don't take medications for psychiatric disorders, and taking medication in general is reserved for like, emergency situations. She won't just take Tylenol or aleve if she has a headache. She acts almost suspicious of medications."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","I think that’s been changed to Elvanse/Vyvanse now.

Edit: because it’s harder to abuse"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","I see, I did not know that, but it makes sense."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Adderall is not licensed in the UK either.
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","I was talking with my sons Dr who’s doing his titration the other day and she told me that in the UK we only have one that’s actually very similar to adderall and it’s rarely prescribed and that usually they go for the different variations of Methylphenidate as you’ve said . 

She tried him on two diff ones that were both slow release and neither faired well .. so with my suggestion she’s put him on Concertra and so far so good 😊"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",What dosage did you initially get? Im also from denmark and i have my first drug appointment tomorow 😅liiiiidt spændt men også bekymret da jeg aldrig har prøvet det før haha
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Amazing to hear. How was your dosing? I’m currently getting diagnosed and I hear it’s impossible to anticipate
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Have it worked in your experience?
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Thanks for the explanation, I don’t really care what I get put on as long as it works"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","I used to take Adderrall for a while and never felt those addictive factors either. I switched to Ritalin since the release was more mild. I feel like they slap those warnings to keep people from selling them. I don’t know anyone who ever got addicted. However, my perception is my reality."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Is it because it’s more addictive you think?
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Yeah it sure seems that way, I think a normal adhd person who follows direction wouldn’t just abuse"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Isn’t adderal better for adults
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","There's research that amphetamines have less side effects in adults. My psychiatric nurse at ADHD centraal even said that she wishes she could skip methylphenidate all together in most cases. I think it has more to do with that there's more and cheaper generic methylphenidate brands out there. 

The main reason they don't subscribe Amphetamines to kids is because it can stunt growth I believe."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Thanks for making that clear, it definitely makes sense!"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Let me preface this by saying you’re not going to find an American who is a bigger proponent of single-payer healthcare than me—your doctor is exactly right. Countries with single-payer healthcare basically say I have XXX,XXX number of people with ADHD who need a first line stimulant, give me prices. It makes sense that (generic) Ritalin would be the cheapest because it’s the oldest. 

In the United States we buy drugs one prescription at a time (generally speaking). So, the prescriber can choose from any of the drugs. However, insurance companies will make them demonstrate they tried cheaper drugs first. 

This is an oversimplification of the actual real world scenarios, but you get the idea."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","That makes a lot of sense, thanks!"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","That’s actually a very interesting point and fascinating to hear from someone who’s been in charge of it! Would you suggest that I suggest elvanse in case methylphenidate doesn’t work for me, or in case I get side effects? I’m uni student and discussing meds with my psychiatrist in a few weeks. I believe amphetamines aren’t as suspect here compared to US for example. We have elvanse and attentin here. Also worried about the gastric side effects due to my cronhs, so great point to know!"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Bupropion did absolutely zero positive effects for me and armodafinil was more effective then concerta short therm. However it messed my sleep heavily, so long therm it wasn't effective"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Other than gastric issues, were there any differences that were commonly reported by patients? Also did you have any patients that preferred methylphenidate to vyvanse? The reason I'm asking is because I was started in vyvanse for 2 months now and not finding it to be very effective.. but I remember taking ritalin a few years ago for a few days and it just seemed to work much better so I want to try that.. however I'm sort of doubting myself after reading so much online about how much better vyvanse is for most people"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Which country do you live in (if you don't mind me asking)??
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Even strattera?
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","That makes somewhat sense, I mean the products have been on market for a looong time and it doesn’t seem that they’ve been changed a lot only the release mechanism"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Wow that’s great, thanks for sharing!"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Zombie is usually the consequence of to high doses (and this only at people which are sensible to stimulants declining the limbic system).
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Ohh how come? I heard people focus great on Ritalin
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Wow that’s different! Elvanse is kinda last resort here and also the most expensive I believe. Why do you think it’s so different?
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Wow that’s a hassle! How do you like elvanse compared to adderall? And how big is the difference actually from Ritalin (methylphenidate) and amphetamines (attentin, adderall, elvanse)?"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Interesting, do you know why the change?"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Do you know if doctors in Estonia are able to prescribe Dexedrine ER?
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","I think in general they’re more hesitant pushing the boundaries perhaps, that could play a role “if it works okay why change it”"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Can confirm. Here in Germany, getting an appointment for diagnosis is nearly impossible because most doctors won’t do it due to ignorance and the stigma around it. Then you find a doctor, and they treat you like a drug addict, tell you that you have to be diagnosed as a child, adults and women can’t have adhd, etc. and there’s very little in the way of medications even if you get far enough to get a prescription. I’d go to another country, but it seems they’re all the same around here."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Certainly seems to be a reason, from this thread it seems: Cheap, less potential for addiction, old therefore most studied etc"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Very good point, what do you mean with safer for the brain? Perhaps you can elaborate again I’m curious"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Yeah I thought it had something to do with that perhaps, but I mean they’re not that different from what I read but yeah"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Definitely seems a big reason, I thought it was  because it’s been more studied or just works for more people but not sure"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","I didn’t expect so many people to share, it’s amazing! I was actually just wondering but seems a lot of others have too! Do you think it’s perhaps “the easy choice” often?"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Ohh we have vyvanse here (elvalse) but it’s somewhat a last resort and also very expensive for the government. What meds do you have good experiences with?
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Is it hard to get it prescribed in Malta? And how you do it? (I am in Malta and thinking about trying the meds)
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",I definitely get you in that!
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Do you think the statistics are true that it works for 60+ % or is it just to support their choice of going for the cheapest
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",The amount of stimulant isn‘t the point. Adderall contains amphetamine salts. Dosed correctly (which is very individual) its not stronger than other amphetamine medication.
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","So it’s somewhat more potent? I thought the only difference was the mechanism and drug, but did not expect it to be that much stronger"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Thanks for sharing! I’m 25 myself, and it seems it’s been that way for along time and still is!"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",How did it not work good enough? And how was vyvanse different?
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",[deleted]
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Okay so the psychiatrist will often have some kind of preference it seems
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Oh I didn’t know, thanks for sharing"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",How did it work out for you? And did you take it everyday?
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Interesting. I’m also in Australia and my psych said lisdexamphetamine/dexamphetamine are first line when commencing ADHD as an adult. He said lisdexamphetamine is preferred, but due to the shortage, I’m currently on dexamphetamine. Methylphenidate (Ritalin) was second line, then long-acting methylphenidate (Concerta) third.

Interestingly, seems to be methylphenidate is the first choice for paediatrics. Not sure why."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Okay, nice with some alternative options if you’re non responder or have a lot of side effects"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Is it any different or just different brand?
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",So basically if side effects from methylphenidate is even just a little you can experiment and try other options?
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Elvanse for adults is on the market in Germany since 2019. It‘s named Elvanse adult.
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Shit that’s harsh I’m in a neighborhood country and we have elvalse at least as last resort
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Amphetamine medication like Elvanse (Vyvanse) or Attentin are NOT illegal in Germany.
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",[deleted]
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Thanks for sharing! May I ask what side effects you started to see? I didn’t know they could come after years, I thought it was only tolerance that could build up."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Did you prevent any kind of caffeine while trying?
If not, try again without caffeine!"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Well that’s straight forward lol
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Damn so sorry to hear that. What side effects did you experience? And what are you on now? If you don’t mind me asking
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Sorry my bad, it’s not. We have elvanse and attentin from what I know. But that’s somewhat last resort if you’re a non responder or bad sides with methylphenidate. What kind of reputation do you mean? If you don’t mind me asking"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Thanks, I’m in a neighbor country :)"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","How do you like elvanse compared to concerta? And how big is the difference actually from concerta (methylphenidate) and amphetamines (attentin, adderall, elvanse)?"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Hey how are you finding the atomoxetine? Im also czech and my doctor prescribed it to me (its the only thing he could give me). Did you feel it changed your personality?
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",It JUST went generic in the US. Was insanely expensive (I was paying $12/pill at one point). I'd guess that it should be more readily available in the EU soon...
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",What do you mean specifically by a systemic issue?
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Not really. There are several other options. No amphetamines though
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","From what I've heard, this is common everywhere outside the US. Japan, Australia, and NZ are the 3 that come to mind first as far as very limited access to medication."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","We might have some non-stims, but I'm not sure. Vi bor i samme land, jajaja."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Yeah for sure, ritalin worked for me, a mate of mine uses adderall now"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Jeez and if you don't respond to either, then what, they just say you don't have ADHD? 😲😶🙄"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","There are a lot of psychiatrist but there is only one place in the country where adults can get diagnose and Ritalin. There are some places where waiting time is shorter but they are private clinics, and an adhd assesment is very expensive. If you have no time or if you have no money a general psychiatrist can prescribe only atomoxetine (non stimulant norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor). And it is not covered by general health insurance so the cost of my monthly medicine is 6-7% of my salary."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","The case in Germany is that public practitioner licences (i.e. practices covered by national health insurance) are handed out by the government in quantities deemed necessary to not oversaturate the ""market"". The situation is bad enough for general practitioners, but for mental healthcare it's actually just horrible. Despite a continuous rise in diagnoses and waiting times (we're not that far off of two years), the number of licences is not increased (proportionately). And to make things worse, pseudopsychologists are allowed to compete for those limited spots.

It's tough to say exactly why that is but looking at the fact that insurance still covers homeopathy (or has done it in the first place), I think, gives a pretty good indication that the ministries are populated by dimwits who can't tell right from wrong"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Hmm, maybe it’s more of a guideline I’m not sure, I started medication a couple of months ago and was put on methylphenidate first and then elvanse second after it didn’t work"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","It's not been changed. My psychiatrist still starts people on methylphenidate (Concerta etc)  before trying Lisdexamfetamine (Elvanse).

I can't really see why it would be harder to abuse Elvanse tbh.

On a side note, Lisdexamfetamine definitely shows up on amphetamine workplace tests which is annoying with all the admin after it."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","I underwent titration abt 6 months ago and was given xaggitin, the nhs’ cheaper version of ritalin/concerta. Same thing tho but at a cheaper production cost and it’s completely free."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Not sure if it's changed, but about 11 months ago the NICE guidelines said Concerta XL (or slow release methelblahblahblah with Concerta just being brand name). I started meds then and my Psychiatrist made me read NICE before we talked about meds!"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Methylphenidate is effective like 80% of the time.

The other factor is cost methylphenidate is significantly cheaper than amphetamines."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Yeah, it's only legal in the US and Canada. Dexedrine, however, is marginally available in the UK and the EU, it's just not commonly prescribed.

TBH, I recently switched from Adderall to Dexedrine ER and holy cow, it is way more effective."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Seems the same here, thanks for sharing its great to know! :)"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","I recently got diagnosed with ADHD at 28. I have started out with 10mg Medikinet and I have weekly meetings with a nurse to adjust. This is my 3rd day of taking it and it's quite underwhelming tbh. It can supposedly also take a while to get the right medicine with the right dosage. As far as the psychiatrist told me, they always start people on Methylphenidate in Denmark because it's the cheapest and it works for most people."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Not startede yet myself, but pretty sure 5mg twice daily is the standard beginning. Some psychiatrists just tell you to experiment up to 20mg in the beginning, probably differs. 
Held og lykke, du skal ikke bekymre dig det skal nok blive godt."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",He started my off with just 10mg a day.  5 in the AM and 5 in the afternoon…. That did not do anything.  He is very very careful.  After trial and error I take 20mg in the AM and 10mg afternoon.  Sometimes I skip the weekend and sometimes I skip the afternoon.  I love that flexibility
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",It depends. Sometimes I think most of the positive effects are placebo.
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","I think if you do have ADHD you would need a much larger dose to feel the addictive effects.

I think the addiction comes from those without ADHD who get a dopamine high."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Well, countries that have stimulants typically made of amphetamines have much more problems with stimulants misuse and illegal selling/buying. Theoretically speaking a person with ADHD who doesn’t misuse medication shouldn’t get addicted to them, but I think that it’s maybe the social problems those meds cause that specifically cause inversion to them."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",In my case she did skip it and put me on dexamfetamine (Tentin) right away. She said methylphenidate is cheaper and that’s why insurance companies want them to prescribe it first.
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Methylphenidate as well (which is Ritalin and Concerta) has a **suspected** side-effect to stunt growth, which is also given to kids, isn't it?  
The current thought is that due to the meds having a side effect of killing hunger signals but also disturbing hormone balance and the increased dopamine, is what stunts the growth, *possibly*. There are so many factors that can affect growth, it's difficult to properly research. I had stunted growth from birth due to having been born too early that affected the development of my entire body, to add to the factors of stunted growth. Genetics, environment and lots of other things can affect it.  
Seeing as some of my friends who have been on those meds their entire life and are one of the tallest, it's clear why it's still a suspicion and not a fact. I actually got more hungry on the meds as my ADHD caused a very delayed signaling of when I was hungry and needed food, I had a phase of first getting slowly weaker before I would actually feel hungry (I learned to use the weaken phase as the signal to go get food before I got medicated, at least). It differs for each person and that makes it difficult.  


My psychiatric nurse at ADHD Centraal and me were actually very happy I responded very well to methylphenidate. So I'm a bit surprised to hearing yours wishes to skip it. I just see it as a ""if xyz doesn't work, try abc next"". Like, every person responds differently to each type of stimulation meds (just like coffee make one relaxed and calm, but anxious and nervous for another)."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Growth inhibition is the same problem at all stimulants. Ist only a timely retardation, the kids grow a bit later."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","I wouldn’t go straight in suggesting Elvanse, I think better let the professional do their job. Definitely tell them about your gastric issues though and if any particular foods can exacerbate it. If you are prescribed  methylphenidate and it works then great, you’re lucky, but if you’ve given it a good trial and it’s not quite working then maybe suggest it"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","That’s a shame. Modafinil is used to treat insomnia, (and may be licensed for ADHD in the future), and bupropion increases availability of dopamine (like adhd meds do) so definitely worth a go before committing to long term stimulants. However, even though modafinil is not classified as a stimulant, it definitely does have stimulant effect.  All these things can mess up sleep for some people unfortunately, particularly at the outset"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",I like it more (Ritalin) not as many side effects. Doesn’t really increase my heart rate or blood pressure or anxiety which amphetamines do
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Hi sorry for the late reply. I don’t know honestly this is a relatively new rule also from what I have read it’s from 2019. I think it has to do a lot with the education and understanding of the general public for ADHD and it’s severity as well as a corresponding change in the healthcare systems attitude about the seriousness of ADHD and the suffering it can cause if untreated. It wasn’t until 2011 that adult ADHD was even considered a real illness in Germany and all prescriptions and therapy for adults had to be done off label and paid for privately and especially the cost of therapy made it financially unviable for most patients. Nowadays it’s all covered by the public health care system. For Elvanse for example the list price in Germany (varies greatly from country to country because the governments are bargaining with the drug company’s for a lower price) 78€. As someone with a public insurance I have to pay 10% of the list price the rest is covered by the insurance, the minimum copayment is 5€ and the maximum is 10€. So that means I only have to pay 7,80€ for my medication."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","I prefer the Adderall, although not by too much. If I could take the elvanse in the morning and then take one regular Adderall in the afternoon, that would probably be the best scenario, but I’ve only ever been on elvanse as a replacement for adderall, not concurrently with it.

The amphetamines vs Ritalin: They both dry my eyes a bit, so I usually keep contact solution handy. Ritalin though, seemed a little less effective generally, and it had the unfortunate side effect of inducing the physical sensations of anxiety even when I wasn’t actually anxious - heart pounding, limbs tingling, etc., for example if I was running a few minutes late to work or similar. I didn’t realize how much of a toll that took over time until I switched back to Adderall. None of the amphetamines, besides the mildly drier eyes I’d say, have any noticeable side effects for me. 

I’m not a chemist so I can’t speak to molecular differences, only that I’ve been told that their structures don’t differ particularly much from each other, but certainly enough to be different compounds. The veracity of that statement, I couldn’t say."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",There was a big meta analysis a few years ago where they concluded that elvanse was more efficacious for adults.
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","No, not really, but during and after the Covid the new diagnosis for adults skyrocketed to thousands (Estonia is 1.3 mil population). ADHD experts and newly diagnosed adults have also organized very quickly and efficiantly. There is super active (hyperactive, yay) interest group. I suppose the medical system cant ignore it anymore.

I do not know the details however."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Maybe I got lucky, but my psychiatrist here in Czech is an absolute saint. Maybe worth looking around"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","I looked into it a little recently after an argument with a guy from somewhere in the EU. He was ranting about America ""giving speed to kids"" and kept bringing up ""no EU country has approved an amphetamine stimulant for treating ADHD."" I didn't know how much stigma and outdated psychology adhd people deal with over there. Hopefully it gets better for you guys."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",That's sad. I had hoped we were beyond that.
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","No they're not that different in terms of effect, but one of them (amphetamines) is more well known to the public.  People generally don't go out of their way to make educated decisions on a lot of things, they just go along with whatever the popular opinion is because it's easier than doing their own research and going against the grain or society."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","It's one of the least effective (compared to newer medicines) and in private medical care is rarely used these days. The newer ones are far better but far more expensive. I started in Xaggitin XL, the off brand version of Concerta XL, basically long release Ritalin. I'm not on Elvanse. The cost if Xaggitin to NHS is about £70, Elvanse is £400. Thankfully due to our socialist healthcare system out government are destroying i only pay £12 a month."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","used Ritalin for a year, was great, learned coding and game dev in that year. But sadly my body's tolerance gain is too fast, eventually had to stop because it stopped working but would give me all the side effects. Switched to Strattera and wellbutrin, they aren't as good as the ritalin for concentration, but good enough to keep me functional. Strattera really helped with clearing my head, so I don't overthink and worry so much about everything anymore.

Though sadly my self motivation is basically in the shitter nowadays, lost all desire to do anything in my free time, so I just spend it with friends to avoid getting depressed from lack of things to do."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","for Ritalin need to go a psychtriast that understands adhd and see from there. 

Maybe request to join the adhd adults facebook group and ask for which doctors to talk to.

I have anton grech, but its very hard to get appointments with him. Need to call on 1st of month to book appointment and they're usually booked within 2 hours.

There's also Dr Gabriel Ellul, joe cassar and a couple others who's name I don't remember, but the admin of that group knows a lot of the doctors and can give you good advice, depending on your location and main issues.

"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","There is no reason to doubt their statistics, but working and optimal is not the same. 

When people start at one drug and stay on it if it works instead of trying them all and pick the best they might be satisfied because it is better than before, but be missing out on possibilities.

There are simply not enough resources to give the follow-up which is needed to find the optimal treatment for each person, it's probably done the most reasonable way as it is."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","I was taking 60mg a day (20mg 3x a day) gave me anxiety, intensely itchy and sensitive skin and tachycardia... im assuming that was a bit much. Im doing better on vyvanse much more gentle"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Oh its the extra step ..why vyvanse can take longer to take effect than adderall
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",I didnt really feel any boost from it. Just felt the same old with a come down that I didnt exp without meds. So I had to change
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Adderal XR
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Just different brand
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Yup, that was at least my experience with my psychiatrist and my son who is 6 had the same issues with rebound effects. And there are even more options for him I think, if it would be necessary :)
I also have a few friends with adhd, some had the same experience with their doctors as me but one in particular isn’t getting the option for Elvanse. I suppose it sometimes depends on the doctor as well, but it’s mostly an insurance issue."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Yh it’s like last resort but also not. Technically under certain cases you can take it, but the little details of it being “technically illegal” means you can’t do a lot of things bc they justify it as the influence of “hard drugs”. Seriously stupid imo"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",i'm sorry to hear that. Can I ask how doesn't it work for you?
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","I had a really high dose and a little bit effect (not as good as can be), but i was at the maximum dose for my age and weight. Same with the long lasting and the short and long lasting dextroamphetamines. I developed racing hartrate, palpitations, higher bloodpressure and an overwhelming feeling of agitation. With the buprobrion i have even less effects but no side effect, so i take what i can get. Also I've lived from my 24th til my 32nd and before my 22th without any drugs and did fine. So all the help is welcom, but i don't necessarily need it."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Yes i did. No cafeïne for me for a while. But my dose was increadibly high when i finally felt some difference and even than not nearly what was expected
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","For dextroamphetamine, abuse was common when it was prescribed for weight loss decades ago.

Something else to consider is I think Europe has been slower to recognize and treat ADHD in adults compared to the US, so there may be more emphasis on the medications used in children more frequently (methylphenidate) than the ones more often used in adults (amphetamines)."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","I was only on Concerta for a month, I’ve been on Elvanse for over a year so it’s not a real comparison as I didn’t get to a full Concerta dose. But Concerta calmed my brain, while Elvanse gives clarity. I feel Elvanse in my body more."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Its not true this day, since last year they can prescribe you concentra or ritalin too. But sometimes you have to pay for it. My friend don't have to, but I know many people who has to pay.

I am glad I have atomoxetine, its important to start low and go very slow.

I don't think it changed my personality, my life, mind and personality is clearer. At one point I had to go lower with my dosage, cause I had no motivation to have fun (I was too much calm and balanced), so I am now on 60mg instead of 80 and that helped. But it was not changing my personality. My boyfriend told me that he loved my impulsivity sometimes, but its minor and I am able to be more present in our relationship, so I decided this kind of impulsivity is not worth it."

"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Our government doesnt like amphethamines
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Adding to the other response, if you ever travel overseas from the US with an amphethamine prescription, you have to check well in advance too see what kind of paperwork you’ll need or if it’s even allowed. In Japan it’s completely illegal to bring, no exceptions"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Yes but some dont respond to non-stimulant-alternatives & may have GI problems with mph. Same 4 me, now i‘ll try dexamphetamine soon"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","I know that Elvanse (which is similar to Vyvanse) is officially registered, but it’s still not available.

Could you list alternatives that you have in mind? Methylphenidate is not a good match for me."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Loads of people take Dex and Vyvanse in Australia. I’ve not met anyone that’s taking Ritalin actually. I’m sure lots of people are, especially kids from what I have read, but as far as I know you can choose which one works for you."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",How come do you think that adderall etc has been the primary in US?
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Eyo! We do have non-stimulant options in Denmark, if that is where you are from! That sentence is the same in Norwegian 😅

The non-stimulant medications are mostly based on atomoxetin, with a single option based on guanfacin.

I know Ritalin (methylphenidat) is the standard here because it is seen as the ""lesser evil"". To be fair the side effects are less likely to be dangerous than Elvanse (dexamfetamin). 

Plus only three versions of medication based on dexamfetamin are sold here, while around 20 versions based on methylphenidat are sold.

I det mindste kan apoteket ikke nægte at give mig min medicin her. Jeg føler med amerikanerne 😬"

"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Both my partner and I were started on elvanse first in the UK by different psychiatrists in different cities.. we did go private though, I suspect one reason for NHS potentially preferring methylphenidate as a first drug is because it's a lot cheaper and available generic

The reason elvanse/vyvanse is harder to abuse is because its a pro-drug and needs to be metabolised first.. so if you crushed it up and snorted it or shot it, it wouldn't hit you any faster or stronger"

Everyone I know with ADHD is on one of those two.  The only time I can remember people talking about methylphenidate was \~15 years ago in high school.  Maybe it's gone out of fashion.   

Really though it probably comes down to whatever the pharmaceutical companies are pushing."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Because it is more effective and has fewer side effects for most people?
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Probably cause pharmaceutical marketing is a massive industry in the US and our isn't elsewhere
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","I had the worst roller-coaster when I was trying ritalin. Elvanse is doing much better for me, though I can get periods of insane sweating, hahaha.

That's interesting, never considered that. Thanks for the info. I was just going down the lines of taking more etc. Still remember being a space cadet on my first dose of Elvanse that I never had to the same degree with methylphenidate (instant or slow release)

There is definitely a cost implication with the NHS which is why they'll also start on the cheaper instant release methylphenidate (forgot the brand name) before trying the slightly more expensive Concerta.

I found more positive effects & less side effects with Elvanse personally. It also feels less harsh on the body."

Backed of Wellbutrin and I feel fucking great."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","More than likely will start you on a slow release methylphenidate such as concerta as there are lower risks of abuse because it get delivered over 12 hours as opposed to Ritalin that you could crush and snort.  

It’s also not unusual to be prescribed a small dose of Ritalin in the evening if you start experiencing a crash after 12 hours on concerta…it’s like a top up till bed time.

It’s also important that depending on your weight size and metabolism your dosage could be higher than someone that is small & slight.   Normally start you off low and then up every week or two till it works."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Definitely individual. It’s a side effect which should be eliminated during titration if possible as you may get stuck with the meds for a long time and may become intolerable

"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","my doctor was against it, but yes I want to try it. and ye at this point Ritalin gives me very bad nausea, headaches/migraines, dizzyness and fatigue/exhaustion.

"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Its hard to judge with Strattera, its a lot more subtle, I could feel the reduced overthinking within a week, but mostly the first few weeks it just made very sleepy, I was sleeping a lot back then.

But in general I noticed how I didn't get angry anywhere near as often, had a clear mind more often and in general felt more relaxed. Though I ended up needing to take wellbutrin to counteract the sleepyness. But together they are a good combo for me.

Only thing lacking is motivation to a longterm task. But when i was jogging everyday I did have those. Just with a job, I don't have time anymore to do that in the morning."

"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Amphetamine increases dopamine even when you aren't really trying to focus.

No one has ever complained or even commented. Thank fuck for the Danish system. It isn't perfect, but it sure as hell is better than most."

Like anything in life there will always be exceptions because there may be other Comorbidities in play etc…."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Det er nok individuelt. Husker ikke helt hvordan jeg lå an, men var blant de få % som ikke merket noen positivt virkning av de andre. Er nok derfor jeg ble satt på xr :)"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","For sure, I get to the 85% almost immediately (ritalin, antidepressants, blood thinners, I have a whole pharmacy at home!) and I still spend thousands a year on medication. I do not want to think about what I would spend with tilskud.

And generic too. Standard price for my 40 mg methylphenidat is 125 kr. for 30 capsules. Brand name Ritalin is 470 kr. for the same thing...

If I had to buy brand name without tilskud I would be paying 1292 kr. per month just on that....."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Makes sense then that I hadn't had it suggested. My klinik is a private firm that deals with adhd/asd and codiagnosis with substance misuse.
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Definitely that was also what I thought, and to be honest it’s impossible to know if Ritalin will in fact work better for me, so I’ll just be honest and follow my psychiatrists directions :-) thanks!"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?",Thanks! I’ll definitely check it
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","I’ve seen quite a lot of different opinions about brand vs generic, something that I never thought about or felt myself. So I think I’ll stick with brand when I start and just pay the extra to be more “sure”"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Ooof, yeah w/o tilskud my elvanse would be like 4.000 kr if they're having a shortage on anything above 20mg, otherwise it's like 1.000kr.
 I think aduvanz is slightly cheaper but I haven't bought it.. I'll have to see what generics will look like here as well."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Yeah and don’t expect it to work straight away because if dosage is to low you won’t notice a change.  The reason I say this is that at first I thought it didn’t work and was very disappointed but once dosage was correct I instantly noticed and was able to concentrate on things.  I still struggle with procrastination but can stay at a task without getting distracted.   

A simple example was I was never able to sit in my seat for a full movie at the cinema. Always needed to get up and go to the toilet despite not really needing to go… That changed after meds and it was the end of the movie before I noticed.

It also majorly changed my sleep…used never be able to get to sleep at night as mind was always racing with thoughts…now im asleep in 5 mins…it makes me laugh the idea that I go to sleep when on a stimulant…but as the brain isn’t hunting dopamine it’s quite and allows me go to sleep.

Anyway best of luck with your journey."
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","I don't know the law anywhere but in Denmark, but I can say that here there are few reason to not just buy generic. The dosage of the active ingredient (for ritalin that would be methylphenidat) is exactly the same. The only possible differences in the medication are the colouring used as well as any fillers. Besides allergies and just general preference, I can't think of any reason to not buy generic. 

I do sometimes get the not-cheapest generic version, because I prefer their packaging (some blister packaging can be absolute bullshit to open), but I never buy brand name for prescription medication if a generic option is available.

In Denmark it is the norm to a point where it is assumed you buy generic. The cheapest generic option is what you get unless you specifically ask for something else. 
However I have no clue about any other countries, the laws and practices may be different from here!"
"75% of ADHD meds in my country is Ritalin, how come?","Wow that’s great! I have a lot of the same issues so hopefully it will work too, thanks for the tip with starting dose!"

I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,"I 23F was just diagnosed on monday. tuesday, that first day on adderall had me so overwhelmed with joy. like the silence my mind finally found was so refreshing! never experienced anything like it before. i was actually able to focus at work for the first time ever. genuinely mind blowing. i’m so happy you got a medication that works for you!"
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,"You are in the euphoria phase, take advantage of it by breaking bad habits that your ADHD formed."
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,I've always taken Ritalin and it works so well for me. The only downside for me is taking one pill three times a day and experiencing the ramp up to the full dose of the pill and then feeling wear off. My body can't properly absorb extended release pills. I finally told my psychiatrist that I would prefer to start using the methylphenidate skin patch which keeps a steady dose in my system for 9 hours. Love it.
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,[deleted]
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,"I wish doctors saw THIS side of us. We're just so happy to be able to focus, to work, to be able to juggle daily chores. It's not that we are trying to get high or ""cheat"" at anything, we just want to be able to lead functional lives for a change. "
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,"I re-experience what you just experienced every time I take a few months off my meds and go back on them. For me it’s unfortunate because the stimulants actually cause heart issues for me, so I use it sparingly.

Like you though, I will notice the noise stopping. Not only mental clarity, but increased sharpness and resolution in thinking, not to mention a huge mood boost. Depression and anxiety is gone. It would be a miracle drug for me if it didn’t come with side effects such as heart issues."
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,I’m happy you’re feeling relief but with stimulants there is sort of a “honeymoon phase” if you will. In the beginning you feeling amazing and unstoppable but as your body gets used to it and gets a tolerance you don’t get that euphoric feeling anymore. My body gets a tolerance quick and after a short period of time I feel nothing. I don’t take my adderall everyday for this reason because if I do it’s pointless.
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,same thing for me! the ritalin actually helps with my nail picking and anxiety and racing thoughts. and ocd thoughts even. it’s crazy how much one thing can spawn other issues. gotta treat the root not the symptoms!
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,Super jealous! 34f diagnosed roughly a month ago and started Ritalin last week but haven’t felt any changes. Gonna keep with it until my next follow up but I’m glad to hear that other have found success :)
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,"i wish i was allowed to have mine treated, i’ve been refused. 😥"
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,"An hour????

I took methylphenidate (concerta) for weeks until I felt a lil’ better. 

I have crashes/rebound in the afternoon around 3/4. I take 10mg around 1 or 2 to try and avoid that.

I’m thinking of switching to lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse/Elvanse) as I heard it helps with rebounds and binge eating.

I am a 40F and worry about oestrogen drops."
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,"this is great to hear, i'll definitely take note of ritalin in case my doctor wants to consider medicating me!!"
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,"I’m on 5mg and all I notice is ball pain and a headache haha.

My first day/dose too."
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,I got my first ritalin prescription three weeks ago. My doc told me to try out what dosage felt the best and come back to him after some testing. My first day on 30mg made me feel like walking through a fairytale forest lol. Everything is so nice and peaceful. All the noise in my head is gone and I can focus. I CAN FOCUS OH MY GOD!
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,So it seems like now your next step is to get off Vyvanse and try Concerta instead.
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,sm about my life has made more sense since my diagnosis. it's a shame it takes alot of women this long to get answers <3 so happy it's looking up for those like us (:
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,"I 33F & was just diagnosed on Thursday, started adderall XR yesterday. Everything was so quiet it was shocking."
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,"trust me, I am lol the motivation has always been there, thankful to finally able to actualize it <3"
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,How do you suggest ?
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,"I can't handle XR either, I take IR Adderall twice a day and it's perfect. XR just made me mildly anxious and unable to sleep."
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,Never heard of that I may ask my doctor for this instead
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,I once tried boofing my pill and it worker better than taking it orally. But man I don’t wanna keep boofing every morning!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,As a 51 yo dude who was (officially) diagnosed yesterday...please tell me more?
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,"I really am trying to be realistic about it because of this. I've only got started on a 5mg dose, once a day. so I'm definitely going to take this slowly and constantly evaluate how it's affecting me. I really had such a huge sigh of relief today. That I haven't felt in idk how long. so, im hopeful, but realistic :)"
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,"do you drink caffeine and if so, do you notice it causes anxiety?"
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,"Message your doctor and tell them you're not getting any benefit.  They're expecting to hear from you and will adjust your dosage.  Stimulants don't need weeks or even one week to know if they're working or not. You know within hours of taking it.  It's not going to build up and suddenly start working like an anti-depressant.

When I go through the titration phase on a new ADHD med, my doctor just says ""ok, take two, see if that works and message me again tomorrow.""

Seriously, your doctor is expecting to hear from you about whether it's working or not."
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,"I started at 10mg and the only thing it did was stabilize my mood. I called my doctor saying that it's great, but I'm looking for focus (student here) so it's not doing what I need it to do. He said to try different doses for a few days and see what works best. I could be that doubling your dose will make a huge difference so don't be discouraged."
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,What dose are you on?
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,"this is of course entirely my experience and not advice but. that is one thing I like about my vyvanse. I have binge eating issues and in my 8ish month of being on vyvanse, the ""food noise"" is down significantly, my appetite is down, and my bmi is getting into a more healthy range. my urge to eat to fill an emotional void is almost nonexistent. I don't crave things or impulsively eat the donuts brought to the office lol. 

again, all my experience, not that it'll be the same for everyone (:"
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,"Ball pain?

Just diagnosed & deciding meds soon. Ball pain doesn't sound fun."
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,Is concerta an XR version? I'm new & keen to learn.
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,"No but seriously though, the euphoria stage doesn't last. Get on a strict routine and do it every day."
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,Same! IR twice a day but they ran out of my usual dose (within like 2hr drive) for weeks so we decreased the pill dose and I take twice as many (4pills total) tbh it’s kind of nice tho to be able to “customize” based on what I have going on that afternoon and not have like half-tabs everywhere/ disintegrating
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,I forgot to mention that it is on backorder from the manufacturer until mid November.
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,Dude it’s like someone turned off all the background noise in your mind. That wall of TVs tuned to different stations ? They get unplugged ! It’s wonderful
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,Oh I didn’t realize(probably forgot) that! I’ll have to give her a call on Monday! Bless! 💋
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,"Currently on 27mg but I just got bumped up to 36mg, still waiting for it to come in though."
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,"It works differently for every different body and person and that makes it a journey! A long one sometimes.

I was considering taking methylphenidate in the morning then lisdexamfetamine in the afternoon, hoping to get the best of both worlds."
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,"Haha I know. I had that on Strattera too constantly and I used to ejaculate randomly during the day. Not like a full-blown orgasm, but go to pee and you’ll be, you know. First noticed when I went to poop and was like huh that’s not pee coming out.

I’ve heard this can happen on Ritalin and passes quickly."
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,Yes it's the extended release form of ritalin. 12 hours.
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,ty but im already ahead of ya (:

Can you actual sit still? Be content sitting still?"
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,"Welp. I appreciate the insights!

Not a topic we'd find covered on ADHDWomen :)

I'm not even sure what else to say :)"
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,Thanks!
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,"Actually, I should clarify that the company said that my specific dose of 30mg patches are on backorder."
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,Yes but it’s not like yoga though. It’s like that x10
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,"Oh, ok! I’m praying 🙏🏽 I can see"
I'm an hour into my first ritalin dose and I finally get it.,"

I'm definitely not calm hearing that! ;)

Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"I'm really sorry.

I really wanted to live in Japan, but quickly realized that it would be incredibly difficult regarding mental health.

I am glad that you are now in a place that is more accepting of it, despite still having work to do."
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"The situation in Taiwan is the same, and I've even met a few psychiatrists who don't recognize the existence of ADHD, but the situation has improved in recent years."
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"Oh, dude, East Asians, Southeast Asians, and South Asians are like that because of our collectivist culture. However, I think the Japanese, like what you said, tend to be more precautious with emotional expressions than, say, Lowland Filipinos (Loud Af) and Northern Chinese (Belligerent Af). 

Southern Chinese people like my mom, on the other hand, I think are more similar to Japanese people in that saving face is extremely important, and emotional expressions must be kept at room temperature. My mom still doesn’t accept my ADHD diagnosis even though it’s been ten years. I’m not allowed to talk about my ADHD with my Chinese family because they would deem me as defective. 

Northern Filipinos like my dad are more competitive with resources due to natural disasters devastating our crop yields. Therefore, they hold similar sentiments about neuro-cognitive impairments as an indicator of weakness. 

I think Asians overall are probably the most under-diagnosed populations when it comes to neurodevelopment disorders."
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"Not to mention the fact that many stimulants (including Adderall) are illegal due to post-war abuse issues. Even if you’re visiting and have the prescription in its properly labeled container and a letter from your prescribing physician, it’s a no-go. That’s gotta be so tough for ADHDers in Japan. Like what are you supposed to do if non-stimulant options don’t work for you?"
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"I'm a pure Japanese living in Japan, but it's true and it makes me laugh 😂
  I feel like it's a sin to live, and I feel stupid. I found peace by cutting off all ties with my family, friends, and coworkers.  
It's a country where only people who can cooperate with others or are ""customers"" can have fun. In Japan, foreigners will probably be treated as customers for the rest of their lives."
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"I think people with ADHD show their emotions more vividly, and japanese societal standards live on the notion that the emotions you express to the people around you should be, like you said, as unbothersome as it's possible. There are even studies where japanese people are shown scary and gruesome images to see if their reactions are any different compared to western people. The japanese had the same level of disgust as the westerners, but a couple hundred milliseconds after showing the image, they quickly changed their expressions of disgust into a pokerface, all of this because of the learned response thrown upon them by their culture."
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"I am not Japanese but I lived in Japan for a year and while I could get away with a lot due to being a young white American foreigner, I often heard my Japanese friends and acquaintances be very judgmental toward Japanese ppl in their lives who have ADHD symptoms or symptoms of mental illness in general, especially if those individuals have cleanliness issues. I can’t imagine what would it would be like to have ADHD and work in your average Japanese workplace."
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"White dude, been living in Japan for going on 17 years now, my son also has ADHD (He's half), and I gotta say I do feel for my Japanese ADHD brothers and sisters. I managed to find a Japanese company and a career that works with my ADHD, but I'm one of the lucky ones, I think. I more or less get to make my own work and follow whatever hyperfixations I get cause it usually ends up with some kind of something that helps the whole department.    
  
But I work with so many people where I'm like, Jesus Christ you are so ADHD, but I would never dream to broach the subject with them, even though they are clearly drowning in their work. I try to make the fact that I'm adhd known in the case it might help someone who is struggling, and I've talked about ADHD with foreign coworkers who also have it, but have yet to talk to any of my Japanese coworkers about their ADHD (if any of them are even diagnosed to begin with).

That said, I feel like awareness of ADHD here is growing, which is nice, but still has a long way to go. My generation (xennials, millenials) is gaining awareness, but older generations? Forget about it. The internet is also very unkind with regards to adhd (the recent drama with フワチャン I saw so many people talking about people with 発達障害 shouldn't be on tv, etc.) so the wins are small at best... Finding anyone who knows what ADHD is and understands it enough to understand ""you"" is probably less likely than winning the new year lottery.  
  
My son was diagnosed in 2nd grade and he's about to be in 5th grade and he's still the only one that has a diagnosis (and god there are several kids in his class who are very obviously ADHD who just get dismissed as being ""energetic"" etc.) But unlike in America, he gets his medication for free, he also gets to go to a day service where he can interact with other ADHD kids and be with trained teachers that help set him up for success as an adult.  
  
So, it's like... if you look for it hard enough, you *can* find the right support here, but it's from the government, and you have to find it yourself.

And forget about support from family. My sister-in-law's oldest is 12 and is very obviously non-verbal and autistic, but her husband *still* doesn't believe there's something wrong with him. We lucked out in that my father-in-law really took my son's diagnosis seriously and even bought books about it, but my mother-in-law is firmly in the ""you're over-reacting"" camp, so we don't really talk about it around her ><"
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"Would you mind if I ask you how you got diagnosed at all? 

I'm a Russian living in NZ and when I saw a psychiatrist I had a very hard time explaining to her that Russian expectations for discipline are very different to the local ones and that you quickly learn not to interrupt, for example, because you know you'll get punished or scolded for this. Or that you'd get in heaps of trouble if you started walking around the classroom all of a sudden. So it seemed to her like my behaviour was not that abnormal or whatnot, when I just sort of grew up in a different culture."
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"Ironically, as someone with Inattentive type, I found Japan to be a fantastic place to visit. Everything is so organised and easy to navigate. I found it very stress free and calming compared to my every day life back home.

I could definitely see it being how you described if I had to live and work there however."
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"Awww man, I’m sorry to hear this. I’m not sure how to navigate this situation but I’ll offer what I can. Since you live in the UK, do you have any friends or a supportive group that you can talk to about your concerns? Are you able to distance yourself from hyper critical people? As ADHDers, mistakes are just unavoidable for us but you shouldn’t be subjected to reticule because of your disorder. I know that there’s a strong cultural component here so I think limiting time spent with people that project that onto you can make a positive difference in your life. Are you able to get therapy?"
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"Personally, what I do love about Japan is the organisation and uncertainty avoidance culture. There’s less unpredictable behaviour and everything has its place plus an appreciation for nature. The busy cities with loads of stimulation can also be calming for me. I could never deal with the work environments, though."
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"I’m also Japanese with ADHD. Actually, I am currently living and working in Japan. I’m half white though, with a foreign last name, so it kind of puts me at a different situation than a pure Japanese person in this homogeneous society. 

I kind of throw the blame on being foreign for my mistakes like using the wrong kanji all the time. I’ve gotten into trouble for some impulsive decisions and not conforming at work. However, I do get away with a lot because 外人だから仕方ない。 (can’t help it because I’m a “foreigner”) But I’m the only native English speaker at my company so I’m still contributing in some ways.. 

I find the access to affordable therapy and medication great here. I see a therapist at a research university that offers therapy with licensed professionals for 4000 yen per session and I pay like 2000 yen a month for my medication. This access to mental health care is amazing for treating my adhd in Japan."
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"I spent a semester in Japan. I can't imagine what growing up there with ADHD is like. I butted heads with a couple professors because of how harshly they treated even the slightest mistake from me. It's just like you said, Japanese culture and ADHD are a **terrible** match. Not to mention stimulants are illegal. Loved the country. Had an amazing time and met some fantastic people tho. Would absolutely go back but I doubt I could live there."
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"I think this is very true, but also perhaps because of this It was very easy to get diagnosis in Japan. On my first visit to a mental clinic I was prescribed non stimulant ADHD meds to try. And when the meds didn’t work, I discussed my social and work issues and eventually got finally given Concerta. I think Japan doesn’t have so much prejudice about ADHD and being diagnosed and treating yourself is seen maybe as your duty. I’ve received lots of support from people I have told I have ADHD here. But I am foreigner so they also forgive me easier."
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,I have autism and always wondered what that was like in Japan.  Complete inability to read body language or the room or subtext
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"I feel you. I’m living in Japan and actually got my adhd diagnosis here. I’ve been lucky enough to get stimulant medication (concerta)! But I totally feel you about the culture not being a good match. I’m autistic as well and the tatemae culture goes right over my head. Only positive I can think compared to the uk, is actually being able to get an assessment and diagnosis. English waiting list is 2+ years, but I got my diagnosis within 2 weeks of first searching the clinic here."
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"I lived in Japan on my year abroad, although it was only 4 months, but I find being autistic/have ADHD is incredibly difficult there. Sending hugs"
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,I dated a Japanese woman for several years. My (undiagnosed) ADHD traits drove her crazy.   I feel for you.
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,A culture can either make ADHD extra difficult but noticeable or make ADHD more liveable but hard to notice and get diagnosed which is also dangerous. There is no win-win. Lots of ADHD goes unnoticed and undiagnosed in Italy and France or in the Middle East but the problems caused by the condition are still there. Your family and teachers will still label you a certain way. The same goes with autism. I recently sat through the assessment of a little girl whose mother was Japanese. She had just started preschool and was with mom full time so spoke barely English and had all the mannerisms of a Japanese girl. It took me some times to notice her autism in the classroom because of that. It got me thinking about it a lot. That little girl was lucky to have the right people around and a supportive mom who was concerned. Unless you are problematic/causing trouble it is hard to get help usually.
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"Thats funny that your opinion differs so much from mine. Not that either of us are ultimately correct, because of course we have vastly different experiences

I think that a rigid set of rules makes life easier. Of course if you have trouble learning what those rules are its difficult, but once you know them there are no longer decisions. Life is easier for me when I dont have to make social decisions."
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"OP: Obviously, the UK and Japan are very different, but IMO avoiding being a bother is a huge part of UK culture as well. But, letting people know that you're bothered by someone is considered being a bother, so people will always act like everything is fine 😂. 

Frustratingly for foreigners, British communication is very indirect and subtextual, and some British people just don't understand that non-British people don't communicate like this. For example, sometimes an invitation isn't serious and is given out of politeness, and you're supposed to realize this and refuse. 

With that said, the UK is way more ADHD friendly than Japan because failure is basically celebrated and expected. In fact, you're kind of expected to be a bit embarrassed by success and play down your achievements."
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"My friend had a roommate who was going to school in the USA, and when she went back to japan , everyone just told her ""Oh you're too American now"" and dismissed most of her ideas at work. She sounded really unhappy a year later. It sounds like she eventually got used to it, but people sounded so judgemental because she expressed opinions sometimes.

It sounds rough to have any disabilities if you can't just cover it up. Also, people shouldn't have to cover up their problems just to keep everyone else from feeling bad, or whatever the reasons are for ignoring a person's struggles."
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,Japanese culture sounds similar to German culture in some ways.
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,Yes. Having lived in Japan for a while I can understand how this would have caused you considerable frustration and grief. I hope living in the UK may create a more hospitable environment to manage the condition positively.
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,I totally feel you OP. I’m Indonesian and thankfully my last two jobs were at multinational companies so the culture leans more to direct communication and no mind reading shit.
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"I lived and worked in Japan for four years. There was so much I loved but there was so much I really struggled with, especially in the workplace. Tardiness the number one thing. 
And this was as a gaijin, which already gave me a bunch of privileges. Could imagine how difficult it is for locals."
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"The way you’re describing what you feel reminds me somehow of claustrophobia 😬 no way to adjust things, barely room to breathe. I’m really sorry you’re going through that with your roommate, I hope you find a better living situation or she moves out so you can have peace of mind!"
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,Replace Japan with India and you get the same
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"I assumed ADHD would be rough in Japan. I lived there in my early 20s, 3 years on JET program.

I was undiagnosed and I was definitely breaking cultural norms left and right. Along with being painfully forgetful about everything. But as a foreigner, I got a free pass.

My ADHD was “helpful” in that I was constantly exploring, great with teaching younger kids, and very chatty."
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"Realizing hardcore in my 40s as a born & raised Japanese woman living in the US, how much masking it required to appear and be ‘normal & same as everyone else’ as expected. I got the heck out of there as soon as I was done with college, and got my masters to become a therapist. Took a long long time to allow myself to realize that I’m not absolutely at fault for being who I was (which is a narrative they’d tell you, you suck because you suck, it’s all your fault, just be normal), and I actually have AuDHD. My mother in Japan won’t accept that narrative still despite me having become a specialist in that area. She will never get it. So much shaming growing up, for all the characteristics of the symptoms. My father though, who is a socially awkward researching neurologist (at times inappropriate and regularly got shunned from university research lab colleagues), now realizes he must have it too. Not a thing to broadcast to people there yet though, as even with an intention to inform and educate for kinder understanding, speaking up about this and identifying self as a person with them, will lead to being rejected & bashed."
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"Your post literally could be written word for word by my Japanese husband. We both live in Japan but my husband has been off work on mental health leave since December 2022. The first year or so was especially hard - he had a mental breakdown not only from struggles with ADHD, but also abuse from his parents, with certain traumatic memories resurfacing - and I wouldn’t be surprised if a lot of this was due to him being “different” as a child (although his mother is also a narcissistic alcoholic, but that’s another story - it’s a miracle that he’s almost nothing like them).

It’s heartbreaking to hear how low he thinks of himself - in the first year after his breakdown he had many suicidal thoughts and often mumbled “I want to die, I want to die..” as he walked around the house, or would sometimes call me up and say that his life was over and there was no point to continue living. While we’re over the worst of it, I’m
Sure he still feels like that sometimes, and he’s still not mentally in the right place to go back to work and he has a lot of trauma with being a round peg being forced into a square hole that is the Japanese workplace. He takes Strattera as Intuniv just made him tired and irritable - at some point we may consider moving back to the UK…"
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,That sounds a lot like my inner voice. I'm sorry you have to deal with that. It sounds super super stressful.
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"The emphasis on perfectionism and conformity creates pressure and stress, particularly tough for someone with ADHD. Therapy could help manage these challenges and find strategies to prioritize well-being in this cultural context."
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,Making a political compass for comparing societies with an ADHD----------Autism axis
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"I lived in Japan when I was 23 and it was pretty damn difficult! I struggled without my meds and approached a doctor about getting back on Ritalin—he had to look up what Ritalin was and then immediately scoffed. He said I would have to go to a psychiatrist. I told him yes, please refer me to one, and he tried to talk me out of it—“No, you don’t want to go there, it will be frightening for you. There will be schizophrenics there.” I told him I wasn’t frightened by schizophrenic people so he reluctantly referred me. 

The psychiatrist was an absolute sweetheart and knew what ADHD was (he had books about it on the shelves in his office). But he very gently explained to me that stimulant medications were all illegal in Japan (low doses of Ritalin could sometimes be prescribed for narcolepsy, as I recall, but not for ADHD). He put me on this really strong anxiety med instead—it felt like being on Ativan and left me completely zonked at work, so I stopped taking it.

I definitely had conflict with my Japanese boss because of my ADHD. Once she yelled at me in front of all my coworkers because my voice was “too loud”—I’ve struggled to regulate the volume of my voice since I was a small child and it gets particularly loud when I’m happy/excited. Getting called out like that was humiliating. I talked to her about it the next day and explained that I had a disability. She acted sympathetic but then marked me down on my next performance review for letting them hire me without revealing that I had “a problem with my brain.”

The private Japanese tutor I had after moving back to the U.S. was also pretty darn ADHD and she recommended I work at the American branch office of a Japanese company instead of actually working in Japan again. So I got an interpreter job at a Japanese-owned automotive plant in America and it’s so much easier. The Japanese engineers I support there just chalk up all my quirks to “being American.” They don’t know that I’m socially weird even by American standards, so they just accept me as I am. I really love that.

All this to say, I adore Japan and Japanese people, but I feel so fortunate that I wasn’t born there. I had a hard enough time growing up as an ADHD girl in the U.S., which is a comparatively ADHD-friendly country. I never would have made it as a kid in Japan. Not a chance. 

That said, I do see signs that knowledge of ADHD, autism, and other neurodevelopmental disorders is starting to spread a little more in Japan. Concerta is legal there now, so that’s a step in the right direction. I can only hope the country becomes a better place for my Japanese ADHD friends to live in the near future ❤️"
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"I’ve often wondered how someone with ADHD would feel in such a high focused culture. I can’t imagine how stressful that is. 😭

I can’t do anything to help but… *hugs*"
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"I echo this, I’m half Japanese and sometimes I feel a bit embarrassed and ashamed for being forgetful and messier than the rest of my family. There’s that subliminal feeling of shame that’s always constant because everyone else around you is so precise, punctual and organised. That, coupled with the stigma of mental health - my Japanese family could never grasp what ADHD is."
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"I’m sorry to hear of your struggles! I’m Chinese with ADHD, and sadly a lot of my relatives either think ADHD is made up or I just need to “try harder.” I feel like mental diagnoses just aren’t well-understood a lot in East Asia. I try to explain to them that my executive dysfunction is like being made of jello and you can’t move no matter how much your brain is screaming at you, and they just think I’m lazy, lol."
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,So this is probably the root cause of the Hikikomori issue in Japan.
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"America is probably pretty good for people with ADHD, in comparison to a lot of places. I can only really compare it to Europe, but I feel like Germany for example always gives me some trouble. It's not that bad as a visitor, but I've had a couple situations where I got caught off-guard by a stranger's criticism and had a minor RSD episode. 

In the US, we're a lot more accepting of being noisy, showing enthusiasm, and challenging authority. Some of us take it too far at times, but I imagine it's much easier for people with ADHD. 

I'd probably do terrible growing up in Japan. I've been very emotionally reactive since a very young age, and I have some sensory issues on top of that. Even here, I have trouble motivating myself to go out and do anything, because often what happens is I get overstimulated and stressed or start crying. I also have a ""bad habit"" of talking out loud to myself to keep myself regulated through things like finding my way around in a new place. Strangers here already think I'm crazy. 

Do you read Nagata Kabi books? Even her book about being a lesbian is more about mental health struggles than anything else. I don't remember if she has ADHD, but she is a manga artist who talks very candidly about her struggles with a lot of things and how it effects her and her relationship with her family. I have all of her manga that's been released in the US so far."
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"I have actually thought about this! I’m so sorry to hear the struggles I imagined are your reality. I admire much of Japanese culture, but wondered how those with ADHD could manage certain expected disciplined behaviors. I’ve also wondered if those with ADHD are contributing at all to the hikikomori phenomenon I’ve read about… but I’m from America and know little, just conjecturing. 

I’m very sorry. Generational trauma is a real doozy. If you haven’t seen Everything Everywhere All At Once, I highly recommend it as movie therapy. Different culture but very similar struggle with cultural/family expectations. It’s my favorite movie and I think you’d relate to the complex struggles even more than a lot of us do."

Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"Wow I can totally see that. My dad lived in Japan for years and took on a lot of the cultural mannerisms (doesn't mix well with having crazy-- I mean normal-- american kids 😬). My best friend is half Japanese and ADHD too, and it was a big struggle with his dad.  I was recently diagnosed and am just glad to have answers and also understand why my dad was annoyed with me so much. At the same time I relate in a weird way and don't want kids either because I know how overstimulated I would be."

To her credit, she never screamed at me or expressed any frustration through her tone. She was like a polite robot repeating the same things over and over again. 🤣"

Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"I feel you.   
""careless mistakes"" - anyone knows what specifically causes this? Struggling with this too big time, which is surprising as I was very meticulous and organized as a kid, high attention to detail.  

Now I make stupid mistakes from oversight and then regret it afterwards, wondering ""how could've I done that. Was so easy""."
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"I was living in Japan at the time I started to believe I had ADHD. It was practically impossible to get diagnosed there because so many doctors believed that it's impossible for adults to have it, unless they were diagnosed as a child."

Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"Avoid being German, too, or I suppose living in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland with ADHD, too. For more acceptance and freedom to be yourself, recommend living in British or US American mid-west or coastal areas, or 300 years from now."
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"I understand completely, I’m south Asian and have ADHD and there’s a general stigma around mental health issues especially in Asian cultures, where there is limited help available and people tend to be very dismissive and insensitive about it. I was diagnosed as a child and my parents actually discourage me from seeking help and I actually thought that I didn’t need treatment until now as an adult, I’m really struggling with managing the responsibilities of life and reconsidering my choices. They will continue to deny problems due to the stigma and shame and there’s this concept of saving face in Asian culture where they would rather sweep problems under the rug and refuse to acknowledge and work towards a solution. It’s better to ignore other peoples opinions and judgement and do what’s best for you even if it displeases other people."
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,In a brown family they don't even believe adhd is a real thing I rmr ages ago I talked to my sister about it that maybe i have adhd and she said it's the devil in ur mind and I should just be religious and it will go away and that people are just coming up w terms atp and for years I neglected this like yeah adhd can't be real until this year....
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"Oh boy! I totally understand this. I'm not Japanese but taught English in high school there for a few years. 

As a foreigner going through orientation, one of the things I heard the most was _the nail that sticks up gets hammered down._ This was my organization's way of telling us to follow the rules, and to not draw negative attention to ourselves or the organization.

I'm AuDHD so while the ASD craved structure, my ADHD side took advantage of the 'gaijin card' privilege (but not too much because of anxiety). 

OP, are you in the UK temporarily or for the long haul? I imagine you probably also have folks around you in the UK that place stereotypical expectations on you, even if in jest. I hope it's easier to block out those microagressions (or stop them in their tracks), while you're working on unlearning those internalized traits that are causing you distress."

Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"American culture also makes anything other than productivity seem like failure. People, even some close to you, may take your executive difficulties as choices.

Think about the positive here: you have realized how important location/society/culture can be on your mental health, and how much those things change from place to place. I would highly recommend seeking out communities with a more youthful, artistic, academic, and counter-culture vibe. Some might call it “bohemian”. I once spent some frustrating time in Phoenix AZ, trying to make friends. One night in Flagstaff (in the mountains to the north) had me feeling like I had found my people. I was offered jobs, shelter, food, laugher, and the sense of belonging that Phoenix had none of."
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"Someone sent me this research piece the other day, if anyone is interested! This is the link & a copy paste of the objective:

“Objective:
Rates of ADHD are lowest among Asian American children (1–6.1%) compared to all other major ethnic and racial groups in the US, but there is limited literature on reasons for the disparity in estimated prevalence rates.

Method:
We conducted a narrative review to integrate the literature on ADHD in children in Asian countries with that on ADHD among Asian American youth to highlight potential explanations for disparities in ADHD diagnosis and treatment among Asian American children relative to other racial and ethnic groups.”

I grew up taking Japanese Martial arts and even there I struggled with all the formalities."

In the end, I'm sure you are right, even if parts of it may appeal to me."
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"It's really strange for me because traveling in Japan feels more free than anywhere else I've been. Some of this is because Japan has the best designed cities in the world, but also, my being a quiet, meek, AuDHD white person where my ignorance can be excused when I show I'm trying helps.

Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"Fellow ADHD East Asian here, so I definitely feel your pain.

Ever since being diagnosed with ADHD (and finding out I'm possibly on the autism spectrum) and piecing my life together, I've realised why even as a child I've always hated the idea of conforming to other people's standards. ADHD has made a lot of aspects of my life extremely difficult and I always felt like a failure compared to all other model Asians. I hated how we're taught to always obey without challenging authority. That we must always be reserved and polite and not stand out. But that's not who I am.

Masking is obviously common for ADHDers but it's even more so in East Asian countries. There must be so many of us living our lives behind a mask, not being able to embrace who we are.

I also live in the UK now and consider myself lucky that I can be myself, I have other ADHDers to empathise with, and I can be my authentic self."

So it's like who is being diagnosed and who is funding the research? Or is s case of people keeping it on the low due to fear of public perception and everyone is keeping it quiet?

I was thinking of Japan and their concern about hikkimoris. Later on, I realized that a lot of them are probably have ADHD and/or Autism and realized it's much safer to be home away from people. Yet, because of the lack of undertanding or recognition of mental health conditions people just see it as people needing to just 'get over it and go outside.'"
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"Well, scientifically and biologically speaking anyway, we really are defective since our brain just can't function right and we need meds to do what it can't do."
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"It's interesting too because I learned in one of our classes that Asians *""slightly""* have lower attention spans than Europeans, which changed my outlook on so much."
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"I remember years and years ago a Kpop idol got in a major controversy for ""drug trafficking"" - She had to travel back to America every time she needed to refill her adderall and then bring it back to Korea. At one point she was unable to travel, and the treatments available in Korea weren't working, so her family in the US tried to get her prescription mailed to her which failed spectacularly. It's apparently fully illegal in Korea. It legitimately fucked up her career, just trying to obtain her prescribed medication for her diagnosed disorder.

Just a nightmare. There are a lot of things I hate about my country and things aren't perfect in regard to medications right now but at least it's not freaking illegal."
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"I was lucky enough to find a location in Tokyo that will prescribe me concerta, but I basically have to have paperwork on me and also very restricted amounts at a time so I tend to go as long I can without taking them. It's pretty whack coming from Adderall access in America."
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"That reminds me of talking to a person from Japan with ADHD, who said they got Strattera and Intuniv prescribed. I had not heard of those and thought it was stimulants of brands I had not heard of, but apparently it's completely different."
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"Stimulants aren't illegal! You can't get a prescription for Adderall, but Concerta and Vyvanse are OK.   
Intuniv and Straterra also are availalbe, but not stimulants, obviously."
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"Right now I (living in Japan) have the choice of Strattera, Concerta (another name for Ritalin), or Intuniv. It's not a whole lot compared to what I hear about in other countries but it's getting better as Intuniv was added to the short list in 2017."
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,You can get travel exemptions but you need to apply via an embassy before travelling and I’m pretty sure they strictly max out at 60 days
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"AFAIK you need a special transport form in accordance with the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drug filled out, signed and stamped by a specific doctor of your government (which one exactly? Have fun digging through a zillion laws cuz it's typically a huge pain to figure out). They have to accept that one by international law, but it's a huge pain to obtain it. And you'd better tell your embassy in advanced."
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"Fascinating! 

Also, I notice my immediate response as a westerner to something like that is almost a negative judgement about that information, and a kind of sadness that they aren’t able to express themselves honestly, as if that’s what they need to do, but that’s such a western lens. (Which I don’t hold on to as a perspective, just talking about my conditioning). 

I’d imagine from their perspective, the fact that we would continue to outwardly display this disgust, they might have a converse internal negative judgement or pity that we are not as capable of holding a poker face - which might be a disadvantage to us in their eyes. I love this stuff."

Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"Oof I grew up in Turkey with old fashioned strict school system (especially the ones I went, not all of it) and, my dad was heavily raised like that also (not my mom that much). 
I now live in the Nl and I find it extremely difficult to explain this. Like, my whole childhood is hardcore masking. 
I have apparently hyperactive type adhd, I was shocked to learn that and find this out because, I was groomed to be as still as possible (especially as a woman/girl in Tr, boys were allowed to “be boys”). Now, I am hyperactive tornado and I remember being like that till around age 10 when I was hundred percent in masking mode. 
Also, I was not that adhd enough late because, I would get big consequences. I was worse at punctuality than my peers  but here it sounds as if I was ok at it…

Anyway, I think that a good psychiatrist understands that but, it can be very difficult to explain cultural differences. 
Good luck!
(I’d write the things I want to underline on a notebook before seeing a psychiatrist to not to forget mentioning some important cultural differences.)"
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"For me, too much stimulation. I also loved it (lived there for a while) but it was overwhelming."
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"I’m inattentive type too and currently live in Japan. I find it less stressful too, even though my job (being in classrooms everyday) is more stimulating than my old one (desk job). It helps that I live in the countryside. Big cities like Tokyo can be a sensory nightmare. 

I think though there’s definitely more pressure on Japanese people, and foreigners who‘ve lived and assimilated here longer to conform and be socially acceptable."
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"Glad you can take advantage of Japanese racism somewhat in your favor lmao, though I gotta imagine there’s some psychic damage getting called 外人 in the place your grew up"

Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,I find I do well with a lot of rules/structure even if I gripe about it and don’t really fit in. It was this way when I lived in Sweden.
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,“Failure is basically celebrated and expected” - this captures British culture so eloquently 😂
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"I can totally see how ADHD could be challenging in India due to societal expectations, but it’s also surprising given how things run there. After experiencing the pure chaos of Old Delhi, Varanasi, the traffic flow, etc., it’s hard to imagine rigid expectations in a place that seems to thrive on unpredictability!"
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"I think it somewhat depends on how much you like structure and rules or not. I am non-Japanese but I lived in Japan for about a year and I did well because of all the rules. A lot of social interactions and whatnot were more scripted and predictable. Their very indirect communication style is a bit trickier but the basics patterns for that can be learned. 

Yeah I honestly think a lot of hikkomori are autistic folks (many of who likely also have ADHD). Most of them are men so I think that phenomenon is related to how autism and gender and maybe class (since usually their parents provide them food, living space, etc) intersect in Japanese society."
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"I think it depends on what your ADHD/autism needs. For ppl who thrive on structure and rules, Japan offers a lot of that. But for those who need less structure and externally enforced rules or actively dislike those things, they will probably struggle. It also depends if you are just visiting or living there. If you are just visiting, you can experience the country in a more low demand low stress way cuz you don’t need to earn money or deal with a lot of life admin stuff. Japanese work life is notoriously stressful so not dealing with that helps a lot. 

If you are non-Japanese, especially if you happen to be white, they will just chalk up anything quirky or different about you to the fact that you are a foreigner. This allows a lot of foreigners to get away with being different in social situations that wouldn’t be tolerated with a native-born Japanese person. In fact, in some cases, depending on your age, gender, and ethnicity, they view foreigners as exotic and despite your “weirdness” you can be easily popular with some locals. I am not sure about other parts of Asia in this regard."
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"They make an exception for Vyvanse which you can bring in with a special import/export permit - you can download the forms online, but you’ll have to chase them for the result which they won’t release until very close to departure. I thought this was odd until I realised that Vyvanse was a parent of the Takeda corporation."
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"Depends on where in Japan you’re moving. Tokyo? Not really fucked at all. 
Anywhere else? No clue. (Not trying to be unhelpful or funny. I can only speak for being ADHD in Tokyo) 

There’s absolutely more awareness about ADHD. There were some booklets about adult ADHD in the pharmacy I was at this morning, and I’ve gotten government pamphlets in the mail about getting kids diagnosed for ADHD. 

For medication, there’s non stimulants (straterra and Intuniv) and Concerta for stimulant.  You can get subsidies from the government to offset the cost of Dr visits and medication. Plus, there’s incentives for companies to hire people with ADHD, and it’s hard to fire, well, anyone. Plus, things here are super structured, which is nice."
Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"Concerta is a pretty good stimulant medication tho, works for plenty of people. I think only in the US is Adderall as extremely common as it is and I personally have some concerns about this too (even tho I know in certain cases it can be useful but I don’t think it should be the very first line defense for most people as it appears to be in the US)"

Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,"Just from my own experience and also what I’ve heard from others it’s actually really easy. I think culturally Taiwan’s not very accommodating of these things but in terms of getting a diagnosis and medication its not too bad.

I was raised kind of like this, when you can no longer keep up with masking and all the other bullshit people expect you to do you just sink deep into a state of burnout where even basic self maintenance tasks become a struggle (even more than they always were).

at least that's how it was for me, with my low support needs being mistaken for no support needs.  
and I was diagnosed with autism at like 3 years old, goes to show how even an early diagnosis means nothing if the parents don't address it and its implications on literally every aspect of life."

I'm not trying to justify Northern Filipino behavior. Still, the harsh reality of keeping up with your seasonal quotas, local governing corruption, and the lack of transportation to facilitate crop yields make someone a bit tired regarding mental health. 

We have to remember that the previous generation did live a tough life due to WWII, Martial Law, Moro Conflict, etc. Continuous bouts of domestic conflict make one’s society overall less open-minded, and it’s not necessarily their fault. 

There is decent change, though. In my dad’s hometown, my uncle, who has schizophrenia, was able to acquire Risperidone to mitigate his hallucinatory symptoms. Therefore, this implies that there is at least some stream of medication that is accessible to even provincial people.

I would often sit side by side with him and work to get him through his English lessons and work and make sure he didn’t distract the other kids too much. I never blamed him for his behavior. I did a ton of research on tips and tricks for working with children with ADHD. I loved this kid and truly wanted him to succeed and was heartbroken that he was unable to get the care he needed. I will never know for sure but I feel that stimulant medication or an SNRI could have helped him immensely. There’s a very big stigma against mental health in Japan.

Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,"> And that's where I'm confused. I thought that it doesn't matter if you have ADHD or not that. It's still a stimulant so it doesn't matter if you have ADHD or not, if not used correctly it can get you high.

This is correct. Stimulants work the same way for most people (excluding some who process it too quickly or too slowly), regardless of whether you have ADHD or not. [Here's a statement from Dr. Barkley on the topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/oss7ei/official_dr_russell_barkley_summer_ama_thread/h6vmpt3/).

> but I was getting high off it and promptly stopped using it.

Just FYI, it's really common to experience euphoria when starting stimulant treatment. It's totally normal, and not a sign that you don't have ADHD or that you're abusing the medication. It's just a normal side effect that goes away over time. *Do be careful* if you might have another disorder for which stimulants are contraindicated, like bipolar disorder. There are people with BD who take stimulants safely, but you definitely need to keep a careful eye on it.

Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,"I think it’s weird he’s so polarized on this matter. You can have adhd and react adversely to other meds. If he doesn’t move on to prescribing a different option, maybe seek out a second opinion?"
Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,"What I've learned through med school and friends with ADHD's experiences with doctors and psychiatrists I can confidently say, doctor's  don't know what they're talking about sometimes, especially the older doctors. There's so much new information that doctors can't keep up with, and thus practices their job with older, incorrect information and ideas. Definitely go see somebody else if you can. People with ADHD definitely can get high off of their meds."
Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,"Completely false. I have adhd, and used to get high on various adhd meds.

I'm positive I liked abusing them so much BECAUSE of my adhd. The fun part (besides the mood lift) for me was doing homework on time and tackling my to do list. Wild time huh.

This is like saying you can't get high on opioids if you're in pain. You're less likely to subjectively feel high at a therapeutic dose, but you def can still get high. Your doctor is an idiot."
Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,"What do you mean by ""getting high off it?"" Did you actually get high or did the med do exactly what it's supposed to do and you had just never felt that way before? Asking because I've never felt ""high"" on a stimulant, so I'm not really sure what that means, and it's a very subjective term."
Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,"My prescriber started me on Meds for the first time a few months ago. The expectation she set was that I may feel “euphoric” for the first 1-3 days on a new med or at a new dose. She strongly cautioned that this was a side effect, temporary, and part of why these medications were prone to abuse. She has me note my effects and side effects for at least a week following any changes, and then I follow up with her for a quick appointment. Then we finish the month at that dose provided there aren’t bad side effects and follow up again. 

This structure makes sense, and kind of protects against if it’s not a myth.  I appreciate the clear forewarning of what to expect.  In the end, I didn’t ever feel strongly euphoric despite knowing that many others do. When I told her that (and knowing that I was experiencing therapeutic effects), she said that made it a good choice for me so far. 

If your prescriber isn’t helping you “engineer” things this way, it’s likely worth a second opinion. Remember that you can start with one provider for an evaluation/diagnosis, but see someone you have a better rapport with for ongoing medication management and counseling if you’d like. 

Also remember that a lot of diagnoses and the mental health structure in our society is defined by things we can measure.  AKA X, Y, and Z symptoms are called depression (for example), but then a medication comes along that improves those symptoms for 75% of people. Over time, that group of 75% is categorized as depression while the other 25% are treated and researched further. Because the medication doesn’t work, diagnoses are recategorized."
Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,"I can say I don't feel ""high"" when I take it as prescribed. People with adhd can definitely abuse their meds, but I really don't think it's as common as doctors make it out to be? 

I have taken more than I was supposed to when I was a teenager (like 15 years ago) and yeah, that made me feel zooted lol. It wasn't pleasant and I wouldn't do it again, I don't understand the appeal of having heart palpitations and feeling like you're vibrating out of your skin. Like, you can get that feeling from shot-gunning a redbull, which is legal and cheaper lol. 

When I take my meds it gets quiet in my head and instead of sitting on the couch staring at the laundry I can actually fold it. I become conscious of the fact I haven't vacuumed in a couple weeks and do it. To my understanding, when neurotypical people are high on stimulants that is not their reaction lol."
Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,"I agree with the other commenters. Different people react differently to different meds. If we didn’t, there would be no need for so many varied options (not just in ADHD meds, but for any illness or disorder). Suggesting that you don’t have ADHD solely because you had a reaction to one medications sounds sus to me.

Like, some depression meds work well for some people, while inducing dangerous suicidal ideation in others."

Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,"When I started Ritalin it certainly gave me a boost/euphoria for the first week or two. (Yes, similar to meth, just a bit weaker. I did it back in my party days too.) But after that the euphoric effects kinda fade because my tolerance builds up to it and I'm just left with the helpful effects for my executive dysfunction. A doctor once told me I didn't have ADHD because I was able to log in to the telehealth program on the computer for our appointment. They don't know everything."
Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,"Not a doctor, but my guess is anyone can get a ""side effect high,"" but that could very well be eliminated by using a lower dose. Adjusting dosage is essential when trying ADHD meds."
Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,"Hello! I have bipolar disorder and adhd, so I thought I'd give two cents and experience. 


Both disorders can manifest as a dysregulation of dopamine and norepinephrine. For me, the norepinephrine is the most important, as it affects alertness and concentration. I suspected bipolar disorder, so I tried an snri to see if it also improves my concentration. I'm on a mood stabilizer and straterra, and both have helped immensely. 


By the way, I also had a bad reaction to adderall, and I still have adhd. I lost 20 lbs and had 15 panic attacks a week. I suspect that it's because it can also increase adrenaline, and I have an anxiety disorder as well. Ritalin helped some, but I really do love straterra as an adhd med."

Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,"The first few days I took vyvanse, I felt euphoric and ""high"" for lack of a better word. But my ADHD symptoms definitely improved. I stuck with it and the giddy feeling went away but it continued to be a huge help.
 Adderall never makes me feel amped up when I take the right dosage but if I take too much it gives me an uncomfortable tweaky feeling. In contrast, my friends who don't have ADHD and take adderall for fun seem to get high from it and it affects their mood and behavior totally differently than it does mine. So IMO there is probably at least some merit to what your doctor is saying. Meds all affect you differently so I would say to keep trying until you find the right rx and dose. 

Side note: since you are unsure about your ADHD diagnosis, sometimes things like depression and anxiety can act like ADHD. Sometimes the right antidepressant can make a world of difference without stimulants."
Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,"I mean, if it is  bipolar you are dealing with then stimulants can absolutely make you tweak out.  Have you tried strattera?"
Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,"FWIW, I have absolutely no doubt that I have ADHD, and I’ve found Adderall to be a godsend. One provider convinced me to try Vyvanse, which is a similar stimulant medication, and I felt all kinds of strange and terrible the week I took that. Went back to the Adderall and it’s worked since. So in my experience you can have ADHD and still have strange reactions to ADHD meds. 

My first provider gave me 5mg pills of Adderall and told me that I should take one, sit down to study/work and if didn’t feel any change from it after 4 hours, I should try taking two and if I still felt nothing, try three the next day. If I felt nothing after three, he didn’t think it was ADHD. [Caveat: my ADHD may not be as severe as many others as I was already at a very good law school at the time despite being diagnosed as a child and never medicated, so someone with more severe symptoms might need a stronger dose before feeling effects.] 
The point is that provider seemed to have a similar mentality to your current doctor. For me 5mg of Adderall helped me get more work done in a 4 hour period than I ever had before and I never felt euphoric or high, more “locked in” but if he had chosen to put me on Vyvanse instead, he might have concluded I simply didn’t have ADHD and my life would be worse for it. 

Definitely change providers until you find someone more experienced and open-minded and willing to work with you. Finding the proper medication and dose can be life changing. It’s definitely worth the hassle."

Yes there's an effect, yes it makes you feel better, no you're not a bad person for taking it. As long as you're not going outside of your doctors parameters, you're golden my friend.

Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,"Was your doctor aware of your drug abuse problems before prescribing you Ritalin? A friend of mines has ADHD, BPD and is a recovered drug addict. She has been prescribed medication for her ADHD and was told she can only have certain meds that aren't stimulants because of her history. I can't remember the name of what it was you were prescribed so I would maybe ask your doctor about it?"
Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,"I have bipolar disorder and ADHD (yay me lol). Before either diagnosis I also found myself addicted to Adderall and was basically manic for a year. I only took 10mg a day and that was enough to induce euphoric mania. With the help of proper mental health care, I stopped the Adderall and was ultimately diagnosed with bipolar. Currently I’m taking a mood stabilizer and it’s kept me episode-free for years now. When my ADHD was confirmed about 5 years post-bipolar diagnosis, I tried Strattera first. It threw me into a mixed episode. My practitioner was hesitant to try anything else but he put me on Vyvanse. This had an incredibly sedating effect and having to take multiple naps a day just wasn’t feasible for me. It’s been about 7 years since I quit taking Adderall inappropriately, so with extreme caution we tried it out. Now, I’m on 20mg Adderall but with the mood stabilizer in the mix it actually doesn’t even help 100%, which is a far cry from achieving euphoria at just 10mg in the past. The mood stabilizer has really helped with staving off the “high.” My practitioner thinks I could increase the dose safely so it can be more effective but I’m too nervous to try. I’m just thankful I found something to work even just 50% that hasn’t thrown me into a life ruining scenario again. Obviously I’m not qualified to give medical advice but just throwing it out there that if you do have bipolar, perhaps with a mood stabilizer you’ll be able to treat the ADHD safely too.

I told my psychiatrist up front about my history and she didn’t say anything at all about me not being able to get high off the adhd meds or me not having adhd then! Of course I wasn’t taking recommended doses or taking it as directed so that’s part of it, but also I think just stimulants aren’t for everyone.

Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,"I don't think it's very cut and dry like a rule that if you get a high from ADHD meds that you don't have ADHD. From what I've gathered it seems like ADHD is a bit poorly defined and poorly understood because is it doesn't always present in the same way for everyone and varies wildly in severity. The high/not-high thing might be true MOST of the time but the brain chemistry of ADHD is all over the place as evidenced by different medications working for some but not others. 

That being said, when I was recently diagnosed i tried adderall up to I think 20mg and decided it wasn't for me because it potentiated my anxiety and i got crazy ear pain from clenching my jaw. I would not characterize it as enjoyable or ""getting high"". I didn't experience any euphoria or anything like that. So on one hand this is to me a confirmation of my ADHD because I didn't get high, but on the other hand I wonder if the fact that it made me really anxious and all keyed up was a sort of ""high"" that just wasn't a very enjoyable one."

I have heard of plenty of people who were diagnosed with ADHD who did take stimulants who did get plenty of Euphoria from what they were taking. Everyone reacts different though, I also know plenty of people who simply calm down on something like Ritalin. My point is I’m sure there’s plenty of people with ADHD who could still get high off stimulants."
Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,"Ahhhhh no. It can just mean your body doesn't like that specific medicine or that the dose is too high for you to start with. I take 10mg of Adderall with a booster sometimes. If I even go up to 15mg in one dose, I can tell. I don't quite feel high, it's more a jittery wired feelings. If I accidentally take 2 of my 10's or god forbid the one time I accidentally took a 30mg, I will be the energizer bunny. I will not shut up for 10 hours. My friends literally had to put me to bed once because it was 6am and I was still up and I snuck out of the bed & left because it physically pained me to lay there and not do anything.

Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,"I tried meth back when i wasnt medicated, it was the most alive and stable I felt in months of depression. I got the whole powermode and what ever people get from it, but for the most part i felt normal, not all over the place, stable. Thats when i knew i had to go back on meds, as it was a solid decade since i stopped the medication. I tried straterra and it gave me anxiety without mental stability. I tried vivanse it was great for a time, got early euphoria but then i started getting mental fog. I am now on dexies, i dont get any euphoria from them, but i do get clarity, like i can exist and be and do things in the moment. Its like i can be lucid and present all the time, where as unmedicated to get to that state it was far and few inbetween moments. So perhaps, you dont have adhd, but they now classify it all as add or different kinds, you may just not have the hyper part of it. Which as it turns out doesnt exist in adults. I fear that perhaps the hyper part for me caused my brain to develop as a child (and i was an energetic mofo) so when adult hits and body gets old, the hyper part goes away leaving a deficit. Stimulants def rebalance me. But then again, reality of biology is that everyone is diff, diff deficits, diff mechanics of how deficits work, and then drugs effects on the body is not the same for everyone. Like dopamine issues with add and adhd people, it maybe an absorption issue, it maybe an overproduction or under production, or over absorption or under. Its still similar results of not getting enough dopamine but mechanics are diff."
Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,"It’s most common that it works that way  - but that doesn’t mean the mean to everyone reacts the same. Also were you high for sure ? Because a lot of us experience a kind of euphoria for the first week or so. It’s not actually high. It’s just that your brain is working the way it should for the first time and all of a sudden everything is easy and quiet and fast and you kind of feel giddy and confused and weird because it’s so different from how you usually feel inside.  

This isn’t being high. This is literally just how other people walk around feeling all the fucking time.  

THOSE people will get high with meds. Because they’re already so much higher than we are naturally

Try vyvanse. Works way better for me than Ritalin"
Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,"I think your doctor is jumping to conclusions. Which doesn’t necessarily mean that he is wrong. There is a lot of research that some individuals who are ADHD are ADHD because of traumatic events. The last time I mentioned this I was ripped by an individual because ADHD is a neurological disorder. To clarify most patients who are diagnosed as ADHD are not put through an EEG which is the only way to accurately determine if a neurological disorder is present. Also while there isn’t a lot of research it is clear that trauma can change the brain chemistry particularly in young children. 

Anyway because of the trauma factor it is possible that an individual’s ADHD struggles are in fact PTSD, and or hyper vigilance reactionary.  

Because your doctor is assuming several different conclusions I personally think that it is important to see a neurologist.  There is some correlation to the Ritalin theory but only “some.” There are a number of reasons why Ritalin wasn’t right for you. 

If you go back to the doctor I would encourage you to talk to him about fasting. In Europe (eastern) most doctors have their patients suspected of BD BPD fast prior to beginning medication. This allows the body to balance hormones and heal some. I think it’s wise to get a true diagnosis and not a guess (regardless of how educated it is) particularly if it involves long term medication."

Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,"There's a lot of overlap in terms of symptoms for ADHD and BPD. 

Here's the deal. 

A person that does have ADHD, unless taking a dose in excess or incorrect taking their meds, should not get High on a stimulant. 

The stimulant might not work, It might get some symptoms worse as it's not a good fit with the person's brain chemistry. 
It should not give you euphoria. 

People who do get euphoric (and euphoric is a very specific term that does not mean a slight boost in motivation), you either don't have ADHD, took too much OR have another underlying issue. 

Example: if you have ADHD and BPD, I don't think stimulants are a viable treatment, not because you don't have adhd, but because the BPD will be the thing that makes you euphoric from the stimulant. The same way people with BPD can't take anti depressants because they're at risk of entering a manic phase. 

Adhd combined with BPD is a whole other brain chemistry issue diferent from just ADHD. 

Basically, it can be one of 2 things: 

- you may have been incorrectly diagnosed with ADHD when the correct diagnose is BD2 or BPD. 

Or 

- the first diagnosis was correct but you have a comorbitie with BPD/BD2 that is causing the reaction to the stimulants."

Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,Only speaking to my own personal experience. Never felt high on Ritalin.

Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,Well I’m a medical student so I do have some knowledge about meds and I partially agree with this tbh. If you’re taking a low dose of ritalin it really shouldn’t get you high if you suffer from ADHD. Now if you’re taking too high of a dose it could still get you high absolutely however this would be something more common with a stimulant like adderall not Ritalin. But you even mentioned you were on a low dose which is why I find it unlikely. But I think it’s also possible that some people mistake side effects when they first start a medication for being high— although you said you have experience with the feeling. So it’s hard to say. I do know it’s not uncommon for doctors to misdiagnose though. My sister was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and then eventually diagnosed with only ADHD. They share some common symptoms at times.

* more realistic time perception (aka not being late/ rushed cause I lost track of time)
* implementing the strategies i learnt in CBT with a bit more ease

I tracked that. And honestly, it achieved all that. Time is slower in my head now, distractivity reduced by 70%, “starting effort” is lower by 60%. I also found that while I’m still emotional, it’s a bit easier to regulate and exit the spiraling now."

Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,Oh okay. I wasn't sure if I wanted to risk it getting better or worst with my previous history with addiction.  But that's good information that know.
Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,"Well, you say that. But I haven't been on meds for it since I was 19. Sooooo I wouldn't say it's been over prescribed to me. I choose if I feel the need to take a med or not."
Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,"Can you elaborate, because this seems like you are suggesting that ADHD is a behavioral problem caused by economic and social pressures. 

For some of us, medication is the only thing that works."
Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,"Ok cool, however if I can't even function is that a social issue I think not."
Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,"Not only is this response completely useless to the OP, it's also incorrect, and invalidates the OP's experience. Can economic and social pressures exacerbate ADHD? Absolutely. But they don't cause ADHD. It's a neurodevelopmental disorder, as in ADHD brains are actually wired differently. And there's absolutely nothing wrong with using medication as a tool to help someone with ADHD function in their life."
Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,"Ah, I have considered this as well. There are too many options for my little brain."
Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,"Reacting one way or the other doesn't confirm a diagnosis. It's fairly common for people with ADHD to react the opposite way from normies to stimulants, (caffeine too!)  but it's not a diagnostic criteria. However, I have to say, if you're on the BD spectrum, I would advise you to proceed with *extreme* caution about meds. My ex was bipolar (rapid cycling) but got misdiagnosed with ADD and depression. The year she was on Adderall and antidepressants was hellish. Basically she liked being manic, and so she never complained about that part, and the meds essentially made her manic 100% of the time... not a good scene..."
Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,I did not get this sensation with concerta. Only Ritalin and I haven't tried any others. I found it odd and even though maybe I needed time to adjust. But I had the same results.
Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,I got immediate mild-moderate euphoria on my first dose of Adderral IR 20mg (6pm)+ 10mg (12am). Made doc aware. He said thats not necessarily the goal and to focus on how much it's helping me with work. It did but with side effects. Eventually I had asked to adjust spread of dosage (Adderral 10mg x3/day) since the side effects (agitation) was too much. Also Euphoria disappeared after a few more days.
Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,"Made me high as well, but the feeling dissapeared after a few days. Maybe it's a side effect that kind of drags on? Maybe it will dissapear soon."
Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,"Maybe dose too high for you.  People have way different sensitivities to these things.  They make Concerta in an 18mg at the lowest, I think."

Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,Ohh that's very interesting. I completely understand her feelings of enjoying the manic. Super relatable to me.

Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,"I'm currently taking stimulant medication for my ADHD, and I can assure you that I'm not ""drugged."" It simply allows me to function in a somewhat normal manner instead of constantly being overwhelmed by the cacophony in my head. That, along with regular talk therapy and my many coping skills learned over a lifetime, allow me a quality of life that I simply didn't have until I started medication. Does that mean that these medications work that way for everyone with ADHD? Of course not. Everyone's physiology is different, and even everyone's experience of ADHD is different. But for many, many people with ADHD, medications are a life saver. To dismiss that as just people ""drugging their kids"" is a huge oversimplification of a very complex issue."
Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,I don't know that I heard of this drug. I'm gonna look into it. Thank you.
Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,Please don't spread misinformation. Medication response is not indicative of whether you have ADHD or not.
Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,[removed]
Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,"This is incorrect. Ritalin and concerta are both methylphenidate. Addedall, Dexedrine and Vyvanse are amphetamine derivatives."
Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,"Ritalin and Concerta are two brand names for Methylphenidate. They are the same substance, branded differently by two different companies, albeit formulated slightly different."

Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,Same substance but very different release mechanism.
Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,"But since concerta is a retard drug, it works in a more settle way over a longer timeperiod, while ritalin is ""stronger"" for a shorter time."
Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,"Ritalin and concerta are both methylphenidate with different time releases. I felt ‘high’ on Ritalin too, vyanse has so far been much better"
Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,"Concerta and Ritalin are both methylphenidate, concerts is just a longer acting version of it. And I don't know if feeling high on Ritalin means you don't have ADHD, maybe it just means the dose was too high for you. I'm not sure, but you should certainly ask you psychiatrist to perform an evaluation for ADHD specifically before ruling it out entirely based on a years old experience with one medication. That's irresponsible."
Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,[removed]
Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,Well I'm very glad it wasn't just me and someone else experienced it too.
Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,"Yeah I agree with that. I found it very odd for him to simply rule it out after talking to me for half an hour.  
I personally will not be taking it off my list. And will get it looked at further. I just thought it was very odd to say because I had this reaction to a med that means I cannot have this diagnosis. 

Thanks for understanding!"
Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,"Yeah, the human body is a vastly complicated biological machine that reacts differently to different things, and while one thing can be true of 99 people with ADHD, the 1 person for whom it isn't true should not be summarily dismissed from having that diagnosis. It is a primary failing of many physicians to assume that they truly understand everything about the human body, when there is still so much we don't know. In fact, we don't even know why stimulants counteract ADHD, we just know that they do. There are theories, but no specific MOA has been identified because there's still a great deal we don't understand about ADHD itself. 

All of this is to say that doctors jump to conclusions too quickly some times, and you are well within your rights to push back or get a second opinion. Good luck, I hope things work out for you."
Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,"Thanks, this is very helpful.  This psyc I got through a doctor referral at a local hospital. If I wanted a second opinion, do I ask a doctor I got the referral from or do I ask his psyc for another doctors opinions?"
Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,"Ask the referring doc for another referral to a different office, or find some more psychiatrists and reach out to see if you need a referral, but most psychs need a referral."
Is this true? just trying to find out if Ritalin only gets you high if you don't have ADHD,Yeah I'm definitely gonna have to look into it more. I think I'll call around and see. I know that if I get it through the hospital it's covered my our government health care plan. Otherwise it's our of pocket and I don't have insurance for that.

pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,[deleted]
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,That’s so wild. You’re being prescribed it by a doctor. And even if they give it out “like water” in America (yeah right) the fact that they don’t prescribe it often in your country but the doctor felt you needed it seems to justify you getting it even more!
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,"I'm in the US, and I also get treated with suspicion and like I'm a drug addict whenever I inquire about my ADHD meds. Smh. "
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,Given out like water huh? Well I'm dehydrated like a mother fucker then because I haven't been able to get my script for months. I also really should drink more water tbh.
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,"Is that country Italy? If yes, I see your Point."
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,"I live in Belgium and I also get side eyes and rudeness. Luckily no yelling though. Which country are you in?

Edit: give them a bad Google maps review"
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,Europe doesn't add anything here other then being a continent. Name the country because as a fellow European (Dutch) I collect my prescription at the pharmacy and can't relate to your story.
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,It happening in the US too I
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,"I feel you. When I was if France I had horrible experiences too.

I lived in a small city and it was impossible to find a psychiatrist that had any idea about ADHD (most of them thought adult ADHD didn't exists, and one said it existed but that adults couldn't take meds because they would 100% cause heart damage).

So, I had to take the prescriptions from a psychiatrist in Spain (my home country). If anyone doesn't know, prescriptions from any European country are valid in any other European country, but countries are allowed put some restrictions. And France does... There, the pharmacist can reject the prescription if they think you are faking it or if they think it can damage you. So, in many pharmacies they directly rejected it, and even in those that accepted the prescription they always looked at my as if I was a criminal, and stopped accepting it after some months.

Sadly, that's the main reason I don't currently live in France."
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,"Don't know what european country that you're from, but they'd never do this in Denmark"
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,They do not sell it to anyone like it’s water In the US…it’s also hard to get it here lmao (and expensive!) that’s so fucked up that they are allowed to make snide comments like that it’s so unprofessional. I’m sorry OP 😓❤️
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,"Does your country not have medical privacy laws? If it does, I’d make a formal complaint."
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,Report for disability abuse
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,"That's awful and very inappropriate.

This is very different from where I live - Northern Ireland.

My GP sends the prescription to the pharmacy, then the pharmacy texts me when it's ready. When I go in, the medication is in a sealed pharmacy paper bag. I confirm my details, sign for it (Methylphenidate is a class B controlled drug in the UK) and leave.

No one knows what's in my prescription other than the pharmacist. No other customers see it.

If a pharmacist or assistant openly talked about someone's medication to someone else they probably wouldn't be working there much longer."
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,Mine was asking if I was a med student because I ordered NAC and my prescription of Elvanse
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,That's wild. I feel lucky that my meds are posted to me! Even though the shortages mean I keep having to change drugs 🙃
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,"I have a very very hard time imagining this. I've been in Germany six years and I've never experienced pharmacists behaving like that, not in big cities nor small towns."
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,"I would've told them, ""It's actually impressive that you guys work at a pharmacy yet are so ignorant about legal drugs and their importance. I would appreciate if you don't announce out loud what I'm ordering for my own safety or give me more weird looks, thank you""

I absolutely HATE people that work in a certain industry yet are so ignorant about it. Like, what? Isn't that all they do? They should know by know that drugs serve a purpose and are important."" It's not like you're buying opioids (although they are also ok when taken in regular scenarios, administered by informed people)"
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,Ritalin is water in America 🤣  Wait til she hears about Adderall.
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,"I’m sorry to hear about how you are mistreated, OP. Personally I have never had any problems here in the Netherlands. Over the years I have had different adhd meds, and different pharmacies because I moved, and have only experienced professional pharmacists. I order my 3 months supply of meds with an app, and can pick it up the next day without even having to ID myself or anything. Occasionally I had questions about certain things (vitamine c and the meds for example) and they always took my questions seriously and never treated me disrespectful."
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,"I luckily didn't have this problem at all (also from Italy).  

Now, this is definitely inappropriate.  
What surprises me pharmacies refusing to sell it, they can do so only if the prescription is misfiled (which happens, doctors make mistakes), or they have reasonable suspicion of abuse.  
Which would be incredibly wild.

That said, if you cannot go to another pharmacy there's not much to do.  
You can respectfully make your displeasure known, but sadly oftentimes it's necessary to put up with unpleasant people.  
You have been prescribed the medication, you need the medication and it's beneficial for you.  
Their duty is to provide you the medication, there's nothing else that has to be said.  
This approach smothered any kind of reproach that was attempted in my regards.  
I am respectful and I expect matching respect.  

What I can suggest is to ask your psychiatrist for trustworthy pharmacies, you're likely not the only person that's getting prescribed it.  

Also, talk to them about this, if this pharmacy is famous for this kind of behavior (if they do it to you they're likely doing so with other people) and assuming your doctor has your best interest in mind they'll make their displeasure known.  

This kind of behavior harms people because it can lead some to stop using the medicine to avoid confrontation, which directly harms the patient."
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,"The NHS, as absolutely wonderful as it is in other areas, is absolute dog shit in mental health/neurological area. 

They refuse to acknowledge ADHD and what it is. The research is out there for the whole fucking world to see and they purposefully choose to be like “drug addicts, innit?” They are 100% science deniers. 

They’re also like this with Selective Mutism- a childhood anxiety disorder. While the research definitely isn’t where it should be, it’s clear- you have to medicate the children for anxiety. And the whole fucking system is like “nah, dog. Let them be mute forever.” They’ve literally taken away the opportunity for these children to speak and live a normal life- some of them forever. 

It blows my mind to see such a primitive take on managing health care in 2024. 

Again, I’m not saying to flush the whole system but I definitely feel like the French should get involved and fix it, like they do."
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,"unfortunately when it happened i was literally petrified and i couldn’t say anything… literally the WHOLE pharmacy went silent and everyone looked at me, i wanted to disappear. when my doctor prescribed ritalin, the thought of being ashamed about it didn’t even cross my mind, but now it’s a permanent feeling. thank you for commenting, really"
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,"I was at urgent care the other day and all the nurse staff were talking loudly outside my room. I heard one nurse saying the Adderall shortage was really affecting her, but she prefaced it with ""I know what you think, it's not like that."" Definitely reinforced for me that there's a stigma against it in the medical world. A nurse has to be embarrassed to admit to her coworkers she uses Adderall because she thinks they'll assume she's abusing it. And the stuff people say in the pharmacy subreddits show that a lot of pharmacists feel this way too. It's a shame the medical community thinks so little of us when they of all people should understand why we need it."
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,"I wish they gave it out like water, then I wouldn't be fighting to get it for my son so damn hard!!!"
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,that’s exactly what i think. every time i go there i bring my documentation with my doctor’s signature on it so they literally have no right to behave the way they do. some people are just insensitive and definitely not cut out for the job they do
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,Especially since this bullshit shortage that's been going on since 2022.
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,Right. I called a pharmacy one time and asked about a generic adhd med and if they had it they literally rudely said no and immediately hung up
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,"i’m really sorry you experience this too :( we’re all on the same boat unfortunately. in the past i had to buy antidepressant, antipsychotics, all kinds of things, but the treatment i get when it comes to ritalin is on another level of rudeness and disrespect"
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,yes. at this point i don’t think respect and basic manners exist in this country
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,"i live in italy. i’m so sorry this happens to you too, i honestly thought pharmacists behaved differently outside of my country but turns out we’re all treated poorly. also, thank you for the idea about the review! i’ll create a random google account just to do that lol"
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,Good to hear! Do you have experience with picking up ADHD meds at one pharmacy or multiple over there in de polders?
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,I've been to multiple pharmacies in the UK and never had anyone be weird about it. Not even when I showed up with handwritten prescriptions they couldn't fill due to an error... several times in a row.
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,"that’s exactly what happened to me. i was diagnosed by a psychiatrist and a psychologist who specialise in ADHD in adults, but before that i went to many professionals who didn’t even know about ADHD or said “only children can be diagnosed with it”. then, after several months of being diagnosed i received my prescription and i had to go to 20-25 pharmacies, both far and near from where i live (i literally went to the psychiatric department of a hospital, too, and they still didn’t give me Ritalin). everything was worsened by the fact that i’m 20 and they could probably tell i’m a student, so they thought i was just faking it and needed Ritalin for my academic performance. then i found this one pharmacy although i constantly feel anxious because i never know if one day they’re going to suddenly “change their mind”. living like this is so stressful"
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,"That's rough. So much for liberty, equality and brotherhood I guess."
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,"i know, the comment she made was very ignorant and i don’t agree with it at all. i hope one day things get easier for all of us. sending love ❤️🫂"
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,i live in Italy and honestly not getting involved with the law is the best thing you can do here. i can only try to avoid that pharmacist because i clearly remember her face
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,i live in Italy and i can’t report it because it’s not considered a disability
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,"ADHD isn't considered a disability in Italy.

ADHD can be a component in other disability, but by itself it isn't seen as one.  

Also, since it's not specifically a learning disability (given that it impacts other aspects outside school), people with only ADHD aren't given support.  
Unless they pursue a learning disability diagnosis as well."
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,"thank you for the insight. I live in the South of Italy and privacy is a mere concept, especially when it comes to the healthcare system. even when you’re standing in line at the pharmacy, there is no distance between people and most just love to eavesdrop or glance at what others buy, it’s very normalised for everyone to be in others’ business and that’s why the pharmacist answered the old lady when she asked what Ritalin was. there is basically no discretion. not to mention the fact that here ADHD is considered something that only kids can have and there is no law for ADHD adults"
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,"ah yes, something similar happened to me too, but with another pharmacy. they saw that I’m 20 and asked if i needed it to pass my exams"
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,Good to hear it's good in your part of Germany
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,"That's illegal here.  
I think you can get in trouble if you don't get it cleared before coming here as a tourist too.  

Methylphenidate is the only available stimulant in the country."
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,"Guarda sono andata in tipo 20 farmacie prima di trovare questa, neanche io ho mai capito perché si sono sempre tutte rifiutate di vendermelo. appena vedevano la ricetta con il nome Ritalin sgranavano gli occhi e mi dicevano molto velocemente “non ce l’abbiamo”, e non c’era proprio modo neanche di fare una conversazione. forse è dovuto al fatto che è off-label e che in teoria le persone adulte non possono prenderlo, ma comunque la diagnosi è certificata e la responsabilità è mia considerando che ho dovuto firmare vari documenti. cercherò di ricordare che alla fine non sto facendo niente di male ed è un mio diritto avere un farmaco di cui ho bisogno. mi fa comunque piacere sapere che almeno in altre parti d’Italia le cose non stanno così perché sarebbe preoccupante"
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,More like flush the Tories and actually fund the system...
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,You gotta pay to open the tap. Me and my son both pay my pill man $200 a month each. He is an independent psychiatrist. There is so many hoops to jump through to get a prescription or find someone who isn't a judgemental prick even when you have a real diagnosis. Plus with all the shortages there is even more hassle for them.
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,I recommend researching into online psychiatrists via video calls. Telemind is one I used and it’s pretty darn easy to get an adhd prescription. They just have you take an evaluation test on your computer after your first appointment. Then set you up with a medication a few days later. It def wasn’t cheap but it’s a fast and effective way to get your desired med within 1-2 weeks from starting.
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,"Would it be possible for your doctor to order it or handle ordering it through pharmacy?
I believe they would be inclined to help, if you told them what you posted here. Also, I am pretty sure you can report the incident you describe to the police. Possibly even sue for violating your privacy. In any case, the episode would have been recorded on they surveillance."
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,"Most pharmacies won’t give that info out over the phone, some have been robbed because of that mistake. Same thing with opioids and other controlled drugs, you have to go in and talk to them sadly and show your script so they can check"
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,"I want to leave this country as soon as possible.
I think about moving to Belgium, because Italy is so ADHD unfriendly.
We have literally 3 versions of Ritalin for the whole 60 millions of population."
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,"Thank you. You're welcome! 

Luckily my case doesn't seem as bad as yours and I have noticed differences between pharmacies. A german in this thread also said they have no problems with pharmacists.

So I guess it does depend on the country/area/individuals after all. But yeah, the stigma needs to stop."
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,I'm in Austria and I've never had any issues with pharmacies. After the third time or so of picking up a specific dose of Concerta they just started having it in stock and I don't even need to pre-order anymore
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,Haven't tried it at the polders but I have 1 pharmacy. I even collect them from an automated pickup in the wall with a code.
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,"Ah. In Canada, you report to the agency that governs pharmacists, not to the police/law."
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,That’s so weird maybe look up there is no question that the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) covers individuals with ADHD.
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,"Fossi in te lo menzionerei al medico/CSM che ti segue.  
Non alla farmacia ovviamente, è bene evitare di inimicarteli.  Alla fine dei conti se sono gli unici che ti forniscono la medicina tocca fare buon viso a cattivo gioco."
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,"Fortunatamente il medikinet non è più off label (da ottobre scorso), se ti trovi bene con il Ritalin eventualmente possono passarti a quello.  

Il problema fondamentale è che tante farmacie non vogliono avere a che fare con farmaci stupefacenti perché c'è molta responsabilità.  
Se qualcosa non è compilato bene o c'è un problema le penali (salate) le pagano loro.  

Quindi in modo molto ingiusto cercano di fare il possibile per prevenire questo rischio, anche dicendo al paziente che non possono quando in realtà hanno un dovere.  

In fin dei conti se ti dicono ""non posso"" è un chi la detto, mica puoi registrarli. Se ti lamenti possono negarlo."
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,What’s a Torrie?
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,"i’m going to call my doctor on monday and try to schedule an appointment… i’m also almost out of meds and need a new prescription so i need to talk to him anyways. getting involved with the law is unfortunately not an option for me so the only thing i can do is tell my doctor and see if he can do anything about it. the funny thing is that one time he asked me if i’ve ever had any problems with pharmacies etc. and i did briefly mention the way they treat me, but the episode with the pharmacist basically shouting that i take Ritalin happened recently so he doesn’t even know about it"
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,"also i think that a major problem here is that there is no law for adults with ADHD. that’s why i can’t have any accommodations (i’m a university student). basically the system thinks you can only have ADHD if you’re a child… so when they see me, a 20 y.o, walking in there with a Ritalin prescription, they probably think i’m an alien spawned from another dimension just to create problems to them and their little pharmacy"
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,"Also Canadian. Yeah, prescription records can only be disclosed if they are requested by either the patient, the patient's insurance for the purpose of getting the patient their coverage, or by law enforcement. Disclosure to anyone else or any other sort of misuse is grounds for the pharmacist to be potentially stripped of their licence."
pharmacists being rude when i buy ritalin,"It works like that Italy too, OP probably doesn't know that though.  

We have a pharmacist organization that would look in things like these.  
Probably it'd be best they don't though, at least not directly.  
There's a lot of harm that could be caused by bad blood forming.  

They could go through their doctor, that'd be the most anonymous way to do so."

Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,"I’m on Concerta,(which I think is the same as Ritalin/Methylphenidate). I have found it lasts almost exactly 12 hours +- a few minutes"
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,"Were you on instant release Ritalin? Did you try extended release? Concerta could be a good fit for you because the dose increases during the day.

Vyvanse is the adderall class which can feel very different. If Ritalin worked well for you, you may want to stick with the Ritalin class of meds."
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,Have to eat protein to help your body turn it from prodrug to amp then eat protein again roughly 4 hours later to keep the release going keep eating protein keep releasing amp basically (very simplified) for instance I never ate lunch and found my dose of lasting even 8 hours took 2/3 weeks off for tolerance than tried again after getting my food intake normalized and healthier and my vyvanse easily lasts 12 8 of solid stimulation for sure
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,"I have the same problem. I’m on 40mg and I get about 5 or 6 hours?? Some days it feels like it doesn’t do anything. I also have a very high metabolism. No clue, I tried heavy protein breakfast , I tried no breakfast - shit I even tried a small breakfast"
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,"There is a long acting version of ritalin btw. It's called ritalin LA. I literally don't have any down time when I'm on it, and I'm on a pretty light dose."
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,"I could only tolerate Vyvanse for a week before going back to normal, short acting dex. The come downs on Vyvanse were brutal, way worse than anything else I've experienced, including using illicit drugs back in the day."
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,"My diet is already dialled as it gets, 90 Minutes of exercise 5 x per week. 180g Protein, 450g carb, 120g Fat split over 4 meals. 9 house of sleep every night. Constant wake up and sleep time."
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,"Edited by PowerDeleteSuite, bye"
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,Yeah I had the same issue now prescribed to take another 30mg at midday which helps but I'm way more emotionally unstable than when I was on concerta.
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,"What strength are you on?
When I was titrating I crashed at 1 pm at 30/40mg and at 3 pm on 50mg.
I’m fine all day in 70mg"
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,"Same. I just started Vyvance, working really well but only last 6-7 hours, that is 70 mg. Still being titrated on dosage."
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,Vyanese and Ritalin are very different. I use concerta which lasts about 10 hours but also am planning to use quick release to extend it on certain days. There are many combinations that can be helpful
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,"It is weird to switch from Ritalin-types to the Adderall types so suddenly like that. Did your prescriber explain they were putting you on a completely different type of ADHD stimulant?

If you find you have times that Ritalin works for a few hours, then Concerta or a similar long acting form of Ritalin would be much more appropriate for you. 

Adderall/amphetamines act a little differently in the brain, and vyvanse is just a different formulation for slow longterm release of medication on the amphetamine side of the ADHD medication tree. 

If I were in your shoes, I’d rather stick to various types of methylphenidate to see if a slow release form works better."
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,"You need Concerta. It's the all day Ritalin. Most people only respond to Ritalandd based OR Adderall based meds not both. 

I tried Concerta and it put me to sleep for a day. Definitely confirmed Adderall based only for me!"
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,"I’ve been on it twice. Gave me a bit calm and concentration for two hours and then i would be unable to stay awake. I felt a little braindead and not clear/fresh/calm. I had to stress and pace around and do stuff to not Fall asleep-ish. Afternoons was a nightmare with me scrolling and concentration on my phone while having rebound with skin-picking not able to get up and do stuff at the same time.
Never again."
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,"With Vyvanse, the ups and downs are hellish for me. Then afterwards I feel like iterable and short tempered when the meds diminish at the end of the day. I hate it. I haven't taken Vyvanse in several weeks, I hate what it does to it. 

It used to be my ultimate cheat code and now, it's the key to a fucked up day."
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,"I tried Vyvanse and liked the results but it did wear off quickly for me. However it gave me horrible headaches so I couldn’t continue on it. 

I was on Concerta and it worked for me but it only lasted about 6 hours. Concerta was cost prohibitive though, so I asked my doctor to switch me to Ritalin and the 40mg lasts me about 5 hours. 

Ritalin and Wellbutrin (for depression) together so far have been the golden ticket for me. I take them a half hour or so apart and I’m able to make it all day with no crash."
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,"No solutions, only commiserating. I tried Vyvanse as I heard so many good things. I don't think it works for me, I'm looking to try one of the other classes. Adderall IR is better for me though! "
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,"I'm taking 50 mg currently and I'm going to ask for 60 or 70 next appointment.  Vyvanse is a pro-drug, so it converts in your body over the course of the day.  A higher dosage doesn't give much of a stronger effect (at least, not that I've noticed), it just makes the effect last longer."
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,It probably is because vyanese is in the adderall family. Completely different from Ritalin and concerta.  I  would contact my doctor for advice.  Best of luck on this roller coaster called ADHD.
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,"Take 5 mg around 3.
Yes"
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,"My diet is already dialled as it gets, 90 Minutes of exercise 5 x per week. 180g Protein, 450g carb, 120g Fat split over 4 meals. 9 house of sleep every night. Constant wake up and sleep time."
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,Try something else then
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,INSOMNIA DONT TAKE VYVANSE UNLESS YOU WANT COLD FEET AND LOW BLOOD PRESSURE PLEASE
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,I’m on Relexii (basically Concerta).  I get maybe 10ish hours out of it.  I’ve considered switching to Vyvanse but I do t want to mess up a good thing. Methylphenidate makes me feel so mellow though.
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,What's your dosage (10mg / 20mg) ?
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,Same here.
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,"Yes I was on instant, I didn’t try concerta, the doctor did recommend me to do that first but I was so fixated on the 14 hour number I pushed for the Vyvanse. 

I do feel that effect of Vyvanse to be good just not the duration."
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,"Good to know. Been on Vyvanse for years, doctor never suggested I watch my diet like this. I'll give this a try."
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,[deleted]
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,"So wild, the smallest dose of Vyvanse has me off my tits for more than 24 hours. I'm on 60mg Strattera now, stimulants and I don't get on too well. Bodies are so strange!"
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,"What do you eat to get 180g of protein every day? I really want to know. My diet is good, but not very consistent."
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,"It should yes, I have a fast metabolism and the physiatrist said it should last about 7 hours, but I am only getting a couple ours extra than the Ritalin."
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,"I am glad that is a thing, i recon if i have another 20/30 at midday that would have me sorted, i am currently trailing (not prescribed by the phyc just have left over) a 5mg Ritalin booster at 12 and 3 which seems to be doing the job"
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,"Best news iv had all day, currently titrating on 50mg"
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,"My prescriber wanted to put me on concerta but I pushed for Vyvanse cause I heard about the extra long time period it was ment to last and all the good stories and has taken instant dex many years ago from a friend and remember not having any side effects and it lasting ages so I expected Vyvanse to be like that , guess you should listen to the experts 🤦"
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,"The effect of Vyvanse is sensational, all the good of Ritalin without the bad, I’m more present in everyday life not just burying my self in my computer. Just the duration that is killing me"
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,When do you exercise ? I find if you exercise in morning and afternoon it burns it quite quickly
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,"I have had 0 issues with sleep on Ritalin or Vyvanse, I have take Vyvanse 7 hours before bed and Ritalin 2 hours before sleep and slept like a baby every time"
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,Yeah I have horrible insomnia on Vyvanse
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,"Concerta uses a very effective, proprietary slow release mechanism. So it makes sense you would get less than 12 hours."
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,"My dosage is 27mg. Concerta has dosage intervals in 9mg. 18, 27, 36 etc."
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,"You might need a top up of short release Dex, it’s not uncommon for people to need it to finish the day."
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,So relatable lol. I struggle so much just to put myself in bed and go to sleep. Concerta 54mg has been a game changer though. Just gotta remember to take it early enough
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,"Check stomach acidity, maybe add some sodium bicarbonate or Pantoprazol, it can extend the duration of effects. 
Read about it first, it's not medical advice!"
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,I think they can also do a booster with some shorter acting similar thing dexamphetamine? But mine was not even lasting enough to do that which is why I just got more vyvanse but I think it was actually the original plan.
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,That's wild that both kinds work for you. There is Mydayis but I haven't been able to find the generic anywhere and the name brand is around 350 A month.....
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,"Just morning, finish working out about an hour before it take my dose"
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,How long have you been taking vyvanse?
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,I doubt I would get any improvement taking Concerta.Relexii uses it’s own osmotic release system so while technically different in some ways the mechanism of action is the same.  The one I wouldn’t trust is the Malinckrodt “generic” as it’s XR but doesn’t use an osmotic release system (I work in pharmacy and had to learn about this even before I was diagnosed).
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,"I see, I take methylphenidate as well. On 10mg, the effect wears out in about 2-3hours. Post that there is a bit irritability."
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,A week and am already at 50mg
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,"I have been taking it for the past threeish years and after about a month of taking the insomnia came, a year in, the purple feet the purple hands and the loss of appettite came, two years and the cold feet came, two and a half years the low blood pressure and the passing out came"
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,"Crazy, I have the cold hands and feet, but it heightens my blood pressure, not lower it!"
Switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse and I think I regret it ,Do you take hydroxyzine?

Fellow Ritalin takers what do you eat for breakfast,"Not a time saving breakfast, but I love groats. They’re healthier, have a nuttier taste and chewier texture than regular quick oats. 

But because straight healthy things taste like ass to me I like to slice an apple and fry it with a couple tablespoons of brown sugar and cinnamon, nutmeg and cardamom and a super tiny bit of butter and then put it on top of my groats with a bit of whole milk over top. 

Besides that I like to make a spinach and feta egg wrap with some chopped sun dried tomatoes and then use those smaller tortillas, the whole wheat ones and fry the wrap after in a pan so it’s a bit crispy and kinda like that Starbucks wrap. (You can get frozen small cubes of chopped spinach that work great for this) 

If I don’t absolutely love a food I won’t bother making it so I’ve kept that in mind while trying to find meals I like so I’m actually eating. I’ve also been pre making a couple of my favourite soups that have tons of protein and making my own bone broth from scratch for the broths and then freezing the soups in individual portions. Tortilla soup and jambalaya are my faves. They make quick and easy nutritious lunches and dinners. I’ll make 4 large stock pots of soup at a time when I’m prepping. Helps ALOT.

>However, many ADHD medications are not stimulants at all, and some stimulants have a different physiological process that isn't affected by vitamin C like methylphenidate (aka Ritalin). The medications that *are* affected are called amphetamines and are often known by brand names like Adderall, Adderall XL, Dyanavel XR, or Vyvanse.

Whenever I take my Ritalin I have the urge to comment on every Reddit post,"SAME. I think?

I take Concerta. The thing is that yes, I definitely become more productive. However, that productiveness can be focused on the wrong thing.

I try to be unmedicated on my days off. But many times, I have chores or other responsibilities that need to be done at home. So, I take my medication.

Fast forward, no chores have been done. Instead, I've been hyperfocused on reddit and spent hours responding to posts. Time flies away and I don't even realize it.

It's not that I have ""the urge"" per say, more so that I get so hyperfocused on something that's unproductive, rather than doing my responsibilities.

Well, at least I've helped a lot of people with these reddit hyperfocus sessions lol."
Whenever I take my Ritalin I have the urge to comment on every Reddit post,Same. I’m a complete chatterbox when my Vyvanse kicks in. I’ll talk about anything too. Makes no difference to me. 😅

Whenever I take my Ritalin I have the urge to comment on every Reddit post,"I had this issue on vyvanse — like I had to COMPULSIVELY share my thoughts, no matter what they were.

Whenever I take my Ritalin I have the urge to comment on every Reddit post,"The thing I have noticed with stimulants is that whatever you are doing when they kick in- is what your brain will want to continue doing. At least, for me it is. This will be different for some I am sure. However, it sounds like you might be having the same response. The answer- do not open Reddit. Start doing something productive, and when the Ritalin kicks in you will have more success."
Whenever I take my Ritalin I have the urge to comment on every Reddit post,"Damn, I have the urge to do so unmedicated. I waste so much time writing reddit comments and I'm trying to lurk more so that I don't feel compelled to respond when someone replies to something I wrote"

Switched from Ritalin -> Adderall… Game changer!,"Dude, nice! Different people react differently to certain medication. Glad it worked out well."
Switched from Ritalin -> Adderall… Game changer!,"Here's the thing man, the level you're performing at, the ""increased intelligence"", the high degrees of aptitude. That was already inside you. Adderall doesn't make people into superhumans, there are actually studies that have shown that people who don't need Adderall but take it anyway show no increased ability to retain information or be more productive. 


What this means is everything you are doing, all the increased performance and ""intelligence"" that was already in you. When your brain finally found the balance of neurotransmitters it needed it was finally able to function the way it was intended to. 


People without ADHD tend to think stimulants give those with ADHD an unfair advantage, this isn't the case. Those of us who take stimulants that need them have wins like ""I did the dishes"" or ""I folded my laundry"" 


I'll end this here so as to not blunt my point. But let the takeaway from this be that you are not this way solely because of your meds. All of this was already there, you just needed help to be able to utilize it and have access to it like everyone else. 



Added extra: use this time of hyper motivation while you are adjusting to your Adderall as a time to begin laying the ground work for newer, healthier habits that you can fall back on during times when you have down days or can't access a refill. Purge your phone, redo your work spaces, read self help books, and understand that even normal people have lazy days. A down/lazy day doesn't mean your meds have stopped working. It means you're human, I've been on the same dose of Adderall for almost a year now without the need to adjust or increase my dose. Don't let the thought of ""my meds aren't working"" cause you to slip into a nocebo effect"
Switched from Ritalin -> Adderall… Game changer!,"I just got prescribed adderal today, I never took any meds before and was just diagnosed like a month ago, I'm so ecstatic to go and get my meds rn even tho I'm worried about pricing and all that, I have an exam tmrw too and lemme tell you I'm stressed asf, thank you OP for giving me hope, this actually sounds like the dream

Also 20yo male"
Switched from Ritalin -> Adderall… Game changer!,"Awesome it worked! 

I’m literally opposite lol, Adderal does fuck all for me. Not sure why but Ritalin just makes it happen."
Switched from Ritalin -> Adderall… Game changer!,"As a mentally disabled person. After taking Adderall XR I literally found a job and got accepted the next day. You are not wrong. Adderall really does make you feel capable and in return smarter since you are making better choices for your life. Like oh I don't know.. Having or holding a job.

Adderall XR is the best. But watch out you won't get the same effect from Vyvanse in my opinion."
Switched from Ritalin -> Adderall… Game changer!,"Nice! Ritalin made me irritable and jittery feeling. I also got kinda obsessive abt things. Adderall was way different. More calm, focused energy. I also feel like my sentence structure and formulating my thoughts into words was more cohesive and tracked better with Adderall. That was one of the biggest differences I noticed while taking stimulants was I could actually talk more normal lol"
Switched from Ritalin -> Adderall… Game changer!,"Congrats! Just be mindful as you're so early in to the medication (2 days) I would keep an open mind on its effectiveness as a lot of people describe 'honeymoon' periods with the initial positive effects.

I'd pick one important thing to test constantly over the next few weeks (I use work but you might use study, etc depending on your work/study situation atm) and keep seeing how the medication works vs that.

Glad you're feeling good and getting benefit from it though!"
Switched from Ritalin -> Adderall… Game changer!,"Dude it's so weird, Ritalin worked better than Adderall but Ritalin has a weird and catastrophic crash that made me feel dead  inside and a feeling of impending doom. Has anyone else got this from Ritalin?"

I did DNA analysis recently and apparently methylphenidate is slightly toxic to me, I've been using concerta for years. I'll talk to my psych about switching to Adderall XR, cuz apparently I will have a much better response to amphetamines"
Switched from Ritalin -> Adderall… Game changer!,Happy for you but everyone’s different. I had the exact opposite experience.
Switched from Ritalin -> Adderall… Game changer!,"MPH doesnt work on me either, too bad I live in Europe and Adderall is not available in my country. Glad it worked for you :)"
Switched from Ritalin -> Adderall… Game changer!,"It is still to early to tell tbh.
Not trying to be a dick. Trying to communicate my experience as an observable expectation. 


If you weigh over 120lb , you are likely to need more long term. Also this complete calm will wear off. It will busy calm ( no euphoria ).


I am glad it's working for you. 


I am on 20mg Adderall for almost 12 years now."
Switched from Ritalin -> Adderall… Game changer!,"Be careful, stimulants are very very well known to give users a false sense of superiority, including feeling more intelligent than everyone around them. This feeling is related to the euphoric high that only lasts a few days or weeks, it will go away"
Switched from Ritalin -> Adderall… Game changer!,How do you pay for it? I’m in Alberta (Canada) and my out of pocket cost AFTER my work benefits AND InnioCares (drug co subsidy) is $80/30 pills (XL). My doc sent in an exception (the generic wears off at 3pm and gives me a massive headache) was refused by Blue Cross. Now what? On the days I don’t take it i can barely get out of bed and I’m a single mom.
Switched from Ritalin -> Adderall… Game changer!,"What dose of Ritalin were you on before, I’m on my second week or third week of Ritalin (I think third) and feel the same way that it’s inconsistent and doesn’t help really at 20mg except for making me talk less sometimes."

Switched from Ritalin -> Adderall… Game changer!,"Yeah, Adderall helps me focus but doesn't help my hyperactivity at all. Ritalin/Concerta mellows me out and still helps me focus."

Switched from Ritalin -> Adderall… Game changer!,"Same here, adderall gave me hot flashes and nausea and zero benefit whatsoever. Ol’ reliable Ritalin all the way."
Switched from Ritalin -> Adderall… Game changer!,Wow. How do you usually take it? Immediately after waking up? Wait 1 hour before eating after taking it? I've tried multiple methods but all weren't sufficient for me.
Switched from Ritalin -> Adderall… Game changer!,"I used to work at a company (warehouse-ish) that THANKFULLY allowed for a lot of flexibility and even allowed us to listen to music and watch videos while we worked. Even with that, I was pretty hyperactive and moved around A LOT. But I had good performance so they were okay with me. I left on my own eventually for school reasons. I don't think I could work at any other job without my meds."
Switched from Ritalin -> Adderall… Game changer!,">Adderall XR is the best. But watch out you won't get the same effect from Vyvanse in my opinion.

Does Adderall preserve some anxiety? Vyvanse turned off too much to function."
Switched from Ritalin -> Adderall… Game changer!,"Adderall is 1/3 Levoamphetamine, so it has a norepinephrine kick to your body, giving more push to do something

Vyvanse converts to pure dextroamphetamine, it’s solely a brain stimulant and not a body/brain stimulant like adderall is"

Switched from Ritalin -> Adderall… Game changer!,Genesight?
Switched from Ritalin -> Adderall… Game changer!,"My take is that you should try them all at least once. You're lucky you live in a country that allows several types of ADHD medication, here in France we only have methylphenidate (active ingredient of Ritalin and Concerta), and I've heard it is sometimes too weak (I recently got my diagnosis but haven't started to take any medication so I can't give you my personal opinion about it) but the side effects are also less common and less severe, and it can apparently prevent depression. I suggest you do your own research though, before deciding which one you're going to stick with."
Switched from Ritalin -> Adderall… Game changer!,Thank you. Thankfully this is something that I did and on days where I feel really lazy or unmotivated I am able to continue to get through my day and still be happy with what I accomplished. If you just rely solely on the medication though then when the medication doesn't work you feel like you can't work
Switched from Ritalin -> Adderall… Game changer!,I'm glad to help!
Switched from Ritalin -> Adderall… Game changer!,"I'm not sure what you mean, the dose on prescription says 1 tablet 10 mg"
Switched from Ritalin -> Adderall… Game changer!,"Brooo trust me it worked, todays second day on Adderal omg I can't even tell you, I actually feel better, it's also placebo im pretty sure but like, man do I feel more focused and motivated. I also had an exam right after I took the first pill, ngl I think i acc did good, let's fucking go"
Switched from Ritalin -> Adderall… Game changer!,"Holy shit, I had 100% the same reaction with the hot flashes. I thought it was just me and whatever’s going on up there. 

That’s really interesting!"
Switched from Ritalin -> Adderall… Game changer!,"Yea, alarm gets me up. Book it to medicine cabinet. Slam a 30g chocolate protein shake then take my Ritalin. 

I’ve always struggled eating and follow binge like consumption at dinner to midnight, so I need to quick force myself with protein. Lunch I’m not going to lie is a struggle. 

I take two 30mg LRs a day. I cannot take 3 pills. I have like 75% success rate with my two pills. So IR is completely off the table for me. 

I forget to take my second one off a seconds reminder. 

My psychiatrist wants me to try Mydayis or Astarys but blue cross blue shield won’t fully cover it. They will cover 35% of the pill cost or: 

I can get a $5 script of adderal XR (can’t get near me for 6 months) or $5 script for my 30mg Ritalin LR x60. 

I’m not even sure if I’m answering questions anymore so I will stop here! Lol."
Switched from Ritalin -> Adderall… Game changer!,"To answer your question.. It depends.

Personally I've felt a lack of energy and tiredness on Vyvanse despite upping my dose to the maximum of 70mg. So I'd say Vyvanse is less ""physically stimulating"" which is somewhat a con for me. Besides that, Vyvanse takes hours for it to work, which isn't ideal when you might happen to oversleep or not wake up on time. (so a missed dose will ruin your day) So Vyvanse 100% ruined my sleep. Because I found it difficult to take it consistently on the sametime and then wait 1-3 hours for it to work. When Adderall XR kicks in, you know it kicked in because it doesn't take so much time for it to do so. So you'll know when the medication is ""working"".

The anxiety depends. Avoiding Caffeine helps and I find it easier to avoid caffeine on Adderall XR than Vyvanse for example. So this is individualized. 

I'm currently back on Adderall XR 10mg and will stay on it. Good luck."
Switched from Ritalin -> Adderall… Game changer!,"I think they just meant the dose they started on was a bit too high for them! 
I'm not sure what med you're taking but I was prescribed a pretty low dose of my meds initially & dr and i still decided i should cut them in half for a month or so because I felt too jittery on them at first- metabolism and other things can have a huge effect on how things work for people individually. (And if you're afab, hormones make things extra complicated! Gotta love it, lol.)"
Switched from Ritalin -> Adderall… Game changer!,Dang. I just take the 10mg and it last me 24hrs. That's it. Also what state do you live in if I may ask?
Switched from Ritalin -> Adderall… Game changer!,Idk if this is too late but DO NOT take mydayis. Jesus Christ that medication is a roller coaster. It's super long acting (15-16hrs) and just hits you like a truck. Idk how it's even a medically approved medication. But then again things like Percocet 80mg were also approved. Adderall doesn't really work for me. I get focused but super jittery which causes my anxiety to spike and then I lose focus. I can still sleep on it midday if I wanted and I take 25mg XR. I might try Ritalin. 
Switched from Ritalin -> Adderall… Game changer!,Illinois
Switched from Ritalin -> Adderall… Game changer!,"I’ve been on Ritalin for 20+years. I’ve switched to Mydayis because it works now. However it’s also a close variation of adderal. 

Sorry it didn’t work for you but it’s great for me. One pill, all day. Instead of two 30mg Ritalin long release. I forget the second pill. Mydayis keeps me solid through out."
Switched from Ritalin -> Adderall… Game changer!,"Mydayis is pretty much the same thing as adderall XR, it just has a third breakdown later in the day. So it's more like a 15-18 hour pill. Idk man, I guess after being on stimulants for 20 years it might not be so bad. How many Mg Are you taking? I just feel it's way too strong of a medication. I literally have to take it before I get out of bed or else I'm wired all day and night. I've never tried non amphetamine drugs like Ritalin. I feel like Ritalin might be okay but from what I've heard it's not consistent so I am worried about the ups and downs throughout the day affecting my mood.

This is the same person. Just on my mobile account."

I’ve found the perfect ADHD-friendly career and I feel compelled to share,Thanks for this post. Every ADHDer with a functioning work relationship should post here so that those who can’t figure out their life might get some tips.
I’ve found the perfect ADHD-friendly career and I feel compelled to share,"I am also an X-ray and CT Technologist and I agree with a lot of what you said. I knew I would languish in a desk job so that’s what drove me to this career. I just wanted a job that pays a living wage, that I could easily do overtime if I had to, that I could advance in if I wanted to, and made me think critically while working on my feet.

Context matters though! For anybody considering this path there are certain things you must be ok with. Sure you will intern in a hospital, but hospitals vary greatly. Some are only doing street medicine plus outpatients, some get minor traumas, some do full blown TV drama traumas 24/7. Most people don’t realize just how differently equipped hospitals are and it will define the experience you get in school and what you feel comfortable doing in the long run. 

After you graduate and gain some working experience, you don’t have to work in a hospital necessarily. Purely outpatient environments, orthopedic/spine specialist offices, and non-ER Urgent care places exist but they’re harder to get into and have their own pros and cons. Again, there is a massive difference in the types of environments you can work in, so you need to have an open mind and be flexible enough to jump around until you find something you like. 

You will be dealing with the general public for a living… at their worst. They will have high expectations, be cruel to you, maybe even take a swing at you. Like Karen’s on crack, perhaps literally. You will get bodily fluids on you and you’re gonna learn how they all smell. Sick people will cough straight into your face and eyes with no regard for your health because “you signed up for this”. (Your immune system will also become godlike eventually).

Some people assume you’re a button pusher taking pics of broken bones for a living. Did I mention you also deal with the whole alimentary canal? You’re gonna be giving people contrast enemas and making them drink stuff they’re likely to vomit back up while you’re trying to get your images 😵‍💫. When we say you’ll be working on your feet we mean you will be pushing, pulling, and lifting the most overweight, incapacitated people your brain can imagine likely without enough help. You are the sliding mechanism from bed to table and back again. Wear your good sneakers and stay limber. 

Medical imaging is the backbone of most diagnosis for many pathologies. You’ll be dealing with EVERY SINGLE COVID patient (thank god those numbers have dwindled) and many other people with contagious diseases, respiratory issues, relentless diarrhea from antibiotic resistant organisms, embarrassing stuff, you name it. Whatever the next plague is, you’ll be on the front lines of it right with the nurses, doctors, respiratory, tech partners, and other staff before you even know what the patient has. And a lot of the time they’ll be unnecessary exams ordered by fresh residents still in school who have a lot to learn. 

That being said, it checks a lot of boxes otherwise and is very stable work. I’ve never felt the heat of a layoff because there’s no shortage of work. My coworkers are all grizzled people like me who share in the experience of having a front row seat to everything humanity has to offer. When you get past all the attention seekers and unnecessary stuff there are times where you play a vital role in life-saving care and that is very rewarding. 

There are many positives, very dependent on your environment and type of patients. I just think it’s important to have the whole picture because people don’t realize what the job entails in it’s entirety and don’t fully think through what it’s like to be working with a sick and injured public as a regular thing. Wanting to help people is great, but you also need to protect yourself and there will be times when doing the right thing for your health results in a delay in patient care. A busy hospital setting is designed to juice you for every ounce of productivity you’re worth with stress and guilt (from patients waiting) as the catalyst. The stress used to be my fuel for focus and helped me thrive. That’s changed over the years and I’m happily in a much slower environment now. 

If you stick to Xray and CT your time spent with a patient is minimal for the most part, probably not more than 20 min at a time at the max end. Other modalities can completely change your work dynamic/ time spent with patients and require some extra schooling and work training. With training/schooling there are niche branches you can go into like application management (for the machines), traveling medical device representative (for the OR), Image Archive Administration, management, teaching, other specifically hospital-related non-radiology things using your experience, etc. 

I am very happy I got to an experience level where I feel very useful in many situations. I love to solve problems. Sometimes you can put your extra effort into making the patient more comfortable, sometimes you need to be tough and do what needs to be done even though it makes them more uncomfortable so they can be treated properly. Some exams are scary and the field needs people who have compassion to help patients though a scary experience while still doing their job correctly.

Phew! Didn’t realize I had that much to say!"

I’ve been able to grind out 7 years in a career with a lot of attention to detail, follow up and being accessible to clients at all times with the guidance of a great psychiatrist and the right medication.

When you switched careers, did your salary change dramatically? I ask only because I don’t know the rates of any of the fields you mentioned working in but I imagine finding a new career you love is worth a pay cut (and definitely worth it if you got a pay raise!)"

I’ve found the perfect ADHD-friendly career and I feel compelled to share," I went into medicine for many of the same reasons. In the past I struggled choosing between surgery and emergency medicine because I thrived in both environments, but I felt I had to choose EM because it would “fit better with my ADHD”. I ultimately followed my gut/heart and chose surgery. I haven’t regretted it for a moment. The operating room is perfect for me and immediately brings me into hyper focus, it’s impossible to get distracted when everybody is watching me and it’s such a quiet, sterile environment. 

Want I want to say is that you don’t necessarily have to find an “ADHD compatible career” but find one that works for YOUR ADHD.

Hope this helps"

I am not a tech but I had my first mammogram last year and the technician who did my scans was absolutely committed to creating a warm and positive experience for me. I was scared it would hurt, I wasn't comfortable having my boob out there, etc, and she made me feel like a champ.

same for when I had to get an ultrasound to look at my spleen, and for when I got an MRI on my knee. The techs made the experience bearable.

Bit of a contrast to when I had a diagnostic intrauterine ultrasound performed by my gyno - glad she did it because she wasn't a stranger and it was so intimate, but she didn't have the same demeanor they seem to teach the rad techs.

I’ve found the perfect ADHD-friendly career and I feel compelled to share,"I love that you shared this. It could be a great career path that many people may have never considered. As someone who’s had a lot of health issues and has had many MRIs, I’m constantly hearing them say that Radiology Techs are in high demand. They are desperately needed in hospitals & imaging centers all across the country. 

Getting a good image is extremely important for a patient’s diagnosis and treatment plan, so you DO need to be incredibly focused when you’re taking the images…but it seems like it would only require short bursts of focus, because most scans don’t take very long. 

I would hate to have a tech who was distracted. The last time I got a CT, the ER doc came back in the room and said that it was inconclusive because “the scan is only as good as the tech who does it.” So I felt like I subjected my body to *more* radiation, and it was all for nothing, because the tech wasn’t precise, didn’t do it correctly, and we didn’t get any answers. That was really frustrating. So if anyone here does go into this field: you need to understand the importance of what you’re doing and have the ability to stay laser focused for the 10-20 minutes that each one takes to complete. 

This could be a good option though for people who like healthcare and don’t want to go off to a 4 year university. I wish there were more jobs like this, where you could complete your formal education in ~2 years and get on the fast track to a specific career.

I’ve found the perfect ADHD-friendly career and I feel compelled to share,"This post is what I needed today. In terms of why I struggle with my job. All the career things say jobs like teaching / creative industries are great for people with adhd … well I am an interior architect and hate it with a passion. Projects last up to a year, maybe longer.. I’m bored by them. Sitting at a computer all day. Deadline after deadline to remember for multiple projects. I’m actually feeling quite depressed at the moment. As I recently turned forty and realised I am single and quite lonely because of a career path that I can’t switch off from. 

The other fustration with creative jobs is the subjective nature of the role… there is no right of wrong answer. Design is subjective, you are trying to design to meet you bosses taste, then the clients taste … I don’t even know what I like.

I bought my first home recently and can’t face the decor side of it as I get bored of things so easily therefore can’t commit to a paint colour. 

I want so badly to change careers, but Masters funding is so expensive and I also can’t make my mind up. 

Yeah a job that you leave at work with projects that don’t drag out for months and months and also something that has a definite way to do the task. I thought about interior conservation, learning those skills. But worry forty is too old for a career change.

I’ve found the perfect ADHD-friendly career and I feel compelled to share,"what do you mean ""when you get bored with x-ray you cross train in ct and mri""? You learn about all of them (plus ultrasound and mammograms) when you study for your degree and then there is a 2 month mandatory practice in each field (x-rays/CT/MRI) for a total of 6 months before you can even get to state exams so you can legally start working as an x-ray tech.  
Then you get extra hands on training in CT in your actual workplace (which could take anywhere from 1 month to 3 depending on the schedule) and good luck getting anywhere near at operating an MRI machine if you don't have someone to get you in because MRI is VERY time specific and no one is helping you train when they have to make 8+ patients in their work hours. At least thats my experience!  


Also you dont cycle between x-ray ct and mri unless you qualify for it (which will take a lot of time and a lot of studying if you want to be good at your job and not just press buttons\*) You are either an xray personnel or CT personnel or mri personnel, regardless if you can operate all 3. Most hospitals/private clinics wont pay you the money you would want for being able to do all 3.

It is a nice profession in general but its also very serious and not as adhd friendly as you make it to be. Its good that you found something to keep your focus on the job though, a lot of people never find something they like to do as a profession.  


  
\*Back when i was doing my practice, there were 2 specific people that i was avoiding every time they were on schedule because they knew NOTHING about MRI's and they were just mechanically doing stuff (fixing FOV, altering the slices, etc) and when you asked them ""Why you did what you did?"" They would say ""i don't know, its just how the doctor wants this protocol"" So they knew what they were changing but they didnt know why, and i didnt like that so i was only going to people that were also teaching which were only 2 in an 8 people crew....."

I’ve had jobs where my role included department development or community education and I found those short-term, clear outcome projects to be engaging.

I’ve found the perfect ADHD-friendly career and I feel compelled to share

(Disclaimer: I am not any sort of recruiter and gain nothing financial from this posting. I’m just trying to share my experience in hopes that it can help someone like me.)

I’m a 27yo female diagnosed with ADHD and started medication in 2021. I showed a ton of signs of ADHD as a child but was never diagnosed because I was good at masking/coping, but that’s a story for a different post.

I was previously a teacher and did some social work. I loved the job but like my symptoms were awful in that career because of the lack of daily closure and endless deadlines.

I will never stop talking about how perfect my career is for a brain like mine. And that career is radiologic technologist. If you don’t know what a rad tech is, they’re the people who take your x-rays, CTs, MRIs, and other medical imaging. 

Here’s why it’s perfect:

-All rad techs (except ultrasound) start in x-ray, which is what I do. When you get bored with x-ray, there are tons of opportunities to cross train in MRI, CT, IR, cath lab, vascular IR, mammography, and lots more. I love knowing that when I inevitably become tired of X-ray, I can easily change fields without having to change my place of work. And if I want to leave, I can work in a variety of environments.

-The instant gratification is incredible. There are no long term projects, no calendars full of deadlines, no long boring meetings. I x-ray a patient, get a small high when my images come out beautiful, I scan in like two papers, and then I send the patient on their merry way. If the patient is challenging, my brain is so happy to think outside the box and try different techniques to get things just perfect.

-The job is constantly on the go, which I LOVE! 

-School is only two years and is very hands on. I struggle with lectures so this worked very well for me.

-And best of all, no one judges me when I pound down my Ritalin with a Celsius because they’re all doing the same thing!

I really hope this helps somebody!☺️

EDIT: Wow, I did not anticipate to wake up with this much attention to this post! I wanted to answer a few commonly asked questions that I’m seeing over and over:

1. EDUCATION: A degree in X-ray which is where the majority of people start, is an Associate’s degree. I did the program in 20 months, which included a summer, and took most of my general education credits simultaneously. Several people in my graduating class did the program in three years so their gen eds were done ahead of time. There are Bachelors degrees but they’re not required. Some schools also offer 2+1 programs where you can graduate having done X-ray plus a modality. These are cool if you want to fast track yourself into a modality such as MRI or CT! While some modalities require a formal education, where I live most places will train the ones that don’t right on the job. I encourage those interested in a specific area to go to ARRT.org

2. THE SCHOOLING IS NO JOKE: Although school is short, it’s not for the faint of heart. You do clinicals along with didactic courses, and then at the end, you have to take and pass a massive board exam to get a license. The time those things take are a big commitment. I was really passionate about it all so it wasn’t as hard for me as it was for others!

3. SCHOOLING CAN BE FREE: I didn’t pay a penny to go back to school because I applied for every scholarship and every grant my community college offered. Hospitals need imaging professionals now more than ever so I know many hospitals are sponsoring students to go or offering massive amounts loan forgiveness.

4. PAY: I have a hard time answering questions about pay because it is so variable depending on if you work in a hospital or outpatient setting, if you take call, if you work a shift with high premiums, etc. Most of all, it totally depend on what state you’re in! X-ray techs generally are paid the lowest, but if you can work somewhere that cross trains in other modalities, you can make a lot more. My MRI friends have base pays higher than the staff nurses at the hospital. 

5. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A TOUGH STOMACH: We see just as much as nurses/doctors if not more. Although I don’t generally have to clean patients, I do see open wounds and all of the bodily fluids. You also have to go to the OR during your schooling but you can find jobs that don’t require you to go to the OR. I have many friends in outpatient and they don’t deal with like any bodily fluids or super gross and sickly patients, but you do have to rotate through hospitals during school.

6. AN ABILITY TO DISASSOCIATE IS A MUST: I have a very high level of empathy like many of us ADHDers do. At first, it was hard. A patient comes in for a scan worried their cancer has returned, and you do the scan and see that it has. We don’t diagnose so we can’t tell the patient, we just have to smile and go back in and talk to the patient. When I started, this sucked. But I direct my empathy towards taking care of their immediate needs like getting them a warm blanket or being a listening ear, and don’t really focus on the bad stuff. It happens to every healthcare worker with time. Every once in a while I get a sweet patient with a horrible prognosis and after they leave, I shed a few tears, I’m human. But I am always satisfied that in my short time with them, I helped them feel more comfortable and heard and cared for, and that’s all that matters.

7. IM IN THE UNITED STATES: Other countries require more education. Like nursing though, the US has radiology travelers too! They make really good money and generally only need a year of experience!

8. WORK/LIFE BALANCE AND STRESS: I left teaching because of how unhealthy my work/life balance was. I love my job now because I clock in, do my job, and leave. The only thing I ever have to do outside of work is continuing education credits to maintain my license, which are not hard or very tedious and are only required every other year. The job can be stressful day in and day out if it’s busy or there are hard patients, but that stress is very short term. I clock out and forget about it, and the next day is a new day!!

Sounded great though and been thinking about that career path long ago too if I remember correctly (English is not my native language so title might differ in my country), the career was radiograph / radiologist right?

I work in health care / care taking atm and even though it felt awesome in the start due to the steep(er) learning curve back then, it's starting to get boring / feel ""too much"" like a job, anyways.

Oh well first mile stone will be the studying part which was a total mess the last time. But that was mainly due to the challenging nt segment. Hopefully the rad-thing primarily attracts friendly nerds like myself."
I’ve found the perfect ADHD-friendly career and I feel compelled to share,"I'm combo adhd/autism spectrum, but after struggling to find a career that didn't either completely bore or completely overwhelm me, I'm having a lot of success working at an attraction.


The lion's share of my day to day is guest interaction, leading guest participation events throughout the day and keeping an eye on the floor where our main activities are.


I love guest interaction.  I know exactly how I'm supposed to act with guests. Knowing exactly what is wanted/expected makes me extremely comfortable being in front of people and working a room.  I've surprised myself with how good I am at this and how little it drains me.


The nature of the attraction leads guests to do specific things/ask certain questions that are fairly predictable, which makes me comfortable.

But each person is different, so there is still a ton of variety, surprise and opportunity for improvisation, which keeps me from getting bored. 

There are also a few different attraction activities I can bounce between and it is usually necessary to cycle around cleaning each of them throughout the day as well.  There's pretty much always something to do. 


The most challenging thing for me is navigating relationships with my coworkers,  but even that is different from many other jobs I've had because there's a solidarity and team spirit to working in that kind of environment.


So people, take note, your social skills may thrive in the correct environment, with a little practice. 
Working in an office made me literally want to walk into traffic. My job now makes me feel like a star."

I'm a current Business Analyst at a tech firm that deals with having to adhere to constant tight time-constraints and the role is heavily involved with delivering highly-detailed slide decks through presentations and meetings. I have issues with being detail-oriented naturally and the time constraints don't make that easier, and while I understand there's a large part of the role that is about being organized and establish good habits, I constantly feel fatigued from throwing myself in an environment where everything doesn't come natural to me. One small mistake may cost hours of work and it hasn't been necessarily uncommon for me to have made small mistakes in the past.

I’ve found the perfect ADHD-friendly career and I feel compelled to share,"I don't have an ADHD diagnosis currently, maybe that will change. I definitely have multiple traits in common a high-functioning ADHDer, though.

My current job is still a bit difficult when anything goes wrong in my non-work life, but otherwise it's near perfect mix of different sub-fields in IT to keep me extremely engaged most of the time. 

Basically, my company is small-ish, but delivers to big clients. That means they're optimizing whenever possible, mostly by cutting costs, but sometimes they actually take a full week to tackle a chunk of tech debt, then continue with the usual processes again. 

When a new version's release is getting closer, I test the SW. We have tons of automation atound that, but for each new feature it's great to try and poke it until it breaks. Each time needs a different approach.

After the core functionality is tested, I'm also part of the actual publishing process.

When the shiny new version is oficially out, it's time to polish whatever we can within our automation before the devs code more new features that need testing. Automation is, for me, the most difficult, but also the most interesting part. Shell scripting is sometimes _very_ frustrating, and I might have to push through by sheer stubbornness, but the added challeng is also part of the charm and when I finally get the task done, it's immensely satisfying. 

So, I'm constantly switching hats between what's more important for the devs (short-term results, instant feedback) vs. classic ""janitoring"" (long-term stability) and both give me different puzzles to solve."

Even “boring” jobs as a consultant if you can work the right projects or in a constantly changing environment can be fantastic for people like us. The best advice I can give to anyone, and I’m trying to follow this myself still, is think about something you’re passionate about, what you’re already good at, and find a way to use what you’re good at to help be involved in what you’re passionate about.

I’ve found the perfect ADHD-friendly career and I feel compelled to share,"I’ve been working in the local government sector  for over 2 years, currently as an eligibility case manager helping disabled and aging folks obtain SNAP and Medicaid. 

Pros: 

-I get to work from home 80% of the week with 3 day weekends. This allows me to be productive during the day between phone calls and get cleaning tasks done, go for walks, make meals for myself, hang out with my dog etc. I’m not rushing out the door to get to work, I can enjoy my mornings and stick to a routine with a lot more ease. 

-The pay is decent and I get raises often. The union goes to bat for us which is awesome. I make a comfortable income which allows me to cover my expenses, have disposable income, and live by myself. 

-The work itself is not hard but engaging. I get to talk to people and problem solve, my team is helpful, I have a wonderful boss who doesn’t micromanage and prioritizes work/life balance. I stay busy on appointments and don’t spend grueling hours in meetings. 

-Working in local government offers insane benefits. My health/dental insurance is awesome, retirement is taken care of, accrued sick/vacation time every pay period, paid holidays off. 

-My disability (ADHD) is recognized through ADA regulations and I have support/protection through HR and management. 

-I can leave work at work and am not haunted by work stress on my days off and 5-9.

-Doesn’t require formal schooling/licensing/training/education. There’s about 3-6 month period of intense paid training but once that’s out of the way, it’s a great job. 

Cons:

-On days when I’m not on appointments, there is a lot of mundane/busywork (clerical tasks mostly) that can be hard to focus on, especially working from home. This has been difficult to navigate, but with medication and some life hacking I’m getting by.

-There is a *lot* of policy to know and keep track of, which can be overwhelming and confusing. I ask for help often and feel like I’m behind a lot of my colleagues in this area. 

-It’s a sedentary desk job so it’s important that I schedule activities in between work that keep me up and moving (something I miss form my barista days)

If anyone is interested in this type of work or has any questions, let me know! It’s a job that has worked out well for me and my disability 80% of the time and I’m quite happy with it."

I’ve found the perfect ADHD-friendly career and I feel compelled to share,"If we're talking ADHD friendly careers then I just want to add in that becoming a face painter is amazing for this.

Low start up costs (I started mine fully with a young person's start up grant from something my country offers), and incredibly creative / excellent for hyperfocus. Starting a small business is like a puzzle where you have to slot all the pieces together and try to get it successfully (even when you don't at first, it's still pretty 'brain fun') and dealing with a long line of kids who what to be turned into dinosaurs, the newest cartoon character, a rainbow beetle, is so fun and creative.

 Most of the time they're happy with the experience even if it doesn't turn out like you wanted it to, and all you have to do is also ask them if they would choose to be a flying animal or a undersea animal if they could to keep them entertained. You've got a live band behind you in the background and some fair rides, and yet you are completely in the zone of getting your painting done and looking good. It's both adrenaline fueled and very 'hyperfocus zone' at the same time and the best thing... you're your own boss. 

I'm at the start of my business, but it's so worth it for all the extra 'business side of things' work. Or you can even work with a local face painting company."

Typically we take blood (or other boost fluids/etc) and put it on an analyzer, evaluate the results for correctness and send them out. 

This job also has many many different little nuances that can be wildly different actual jobs depending on where you go and what you want to do.

It is either a 2 year or 4 year degree, and education can vary from full 2 years of program, or 3 (or 4) years of undergrad classes with 1 full calendar year of program and other variations.

Edit to add: I have worked with many coworkers with ADHD who excel in this career is why I mention. Also, imaging was my first choice but when I didn’t get accepted I found the lab and then fell in love with it!"

i'm in australia so we have a good minimum wage already, but the penalty rates for working evenings/after hours/weekends are extremely generous and then tips on top of that. they need me only from thursday to sundays and i usually work 2-3 shifts and usually 4-5 hours each. so i don't have to work as much but i still earn decent money 

i mostly derive pleasure from dressing up and feeling pretty for my job, hustling for tips, the unpredictable nature of it. i get to talk to interesting characters, both the dancers and the patrons and learn their stories. i get to people watch and observe human behaviour. there's always something stimulating my brain

I’ve found the perfect ADHD-friendly career and I feel compelled to share,"Sounds like an amazing job for an ADHD brain!!!

My 'perfect' job for me is retail. I know it sounds dull but I actually excel in retail jobs compared to other jobs I've had.

The main reason is that every task that needs doing is a 'now' task in retail. You're always responding to what customers need or refilling stock or ordering more inventory or cleaning up before close. You just get into a flow and theres no deadlines such as 'complete this project by X date' like i had in office roles ive had.

Im very bad at organising myself to complete tasks by a deadline because my brain only sees tasks as a 'now' or a 'later', and I can't distinguish between the later tasks and figure out what needs doing when. My brain just knows they don't need doing right now, so they slip to the back of my mind and i completely forget about them until an hour before the deadline and then my brain goes into overdrive mode to complete them as suddenly the 'later' task has become a 'now' and its super stressful. I've even missed important client meetings in the past because they were happening in a weeks time, so my brain just forgot as it wasn't a now task. In those jobs I was constantly stressed as I knew I'd always forgotten something important and sooner or later I'd remember but it would be too late by then.

That's why I love retail, there is no 'later', its all 'now'. I just do my shift, go home and there's no stress carried over from my job as I know there's no 'later' tasks that I've forgotten about. It's not perfect, sometimes I get asked to do something at a certain time that day and I of course forget, but I just get reminded when the time approaches so it's no big deal"

I'm ADHD as well and Ive just spent 20 years working as a dance/gymnast performer/teacher, eventually finding my way into full time work as school teacher doing sport/arts.  This whole career path was beyond incredible for me, but over time my body is falling apart and slowly be surely the rights and fair treatment of teachers has gone to absolute poo, cost of living has gone beyond what I can survive on a dancers wage and it's time to go.   I'm freaking out about doing such a change of role as I unfortunately have that whole imposter syndrome thing going on where I never think I'm good enough to be anywhere despite seeming to do a smashing job (well way more often than not :P) at whatever I get hired to do haha.    


X-ray work isn't something I had considered but I think I could do it!  I know lots of adhd thrive as nurses/social workers but I struggle too much with consistency I think to be a nurse, can't really spontaneously wing a medication haha!   Social work might not be the go either as I think i've done my duty for now in dealing with defiant harmed kids/teens who want to try to ruin my life in every way they can think of before they'll let me help them with theirs.

Lifestyle coordinator?  This is the absolute favourite I'm looking at right now, writing up activities for people who may need help creating and adjusting activities for themselves and managing risks for participants.  It's everything I already do except maybe with more willing participants haha!  I would love to hear from someone who does this.

English second language teaching?  How steady is the work? Do the students generally want to learn or be there?

  
Equal rights work that isn't necessarily law based?  would be right into helping with lgbt/race/women's equal rights but not as a lawyer of any kind if there is something like this out there.  


Coding? It looks like learning a language or maths formulas to me, I've never been fantastic at either haha.

any other job where I could help people in some way, with some physical actions but maybe not 9-5 dancing level as my body is on its way to being done haha.

Any kind of teaching where people WANT to be there and I can help them to learn/do something.

Late-breaking news or weather that changed my rundown regularly kept me on my toes and in “fix-it” mode.

I love that it's something different every day; that when I get asked to sub for an elementary music teacher or a class where I know the kids are wild, I can say no thank you. The job begins at 8:30 and ends at 3:50 and work stays at work. You might need to think on the fly, triage some problems and get creative but these things are in our wheelhouse! Only taking jobs when I want, and knowing that if I bail, I'm leaving little kids in a bad/annoying situation, is enough motivation to get me to work when I'd rather sleep in."

Reading OP's post, I started questioning why I don't feel the same way as them.

I love when the xrays come out perfect but I also tend to get frustrated if they don't (like if the patient is shaking from their crushed hand and they cant help it lmao).

Sadly enough people are so rude that it outweighs to absolutely delightful people to me in my memory.

I'm actually in a bootcamp for coding and I love it SO MUCH MORE!!! The problem solving without being under pressure because someone is in a ton of pain is much better for me. I can hyperfocus on code for hours.

I find my job incredibly stressful and difficult because the scope is never well defined, there are no easy wins, and projects take years, and my focus is always shit with such mentally taxing work.

There’s no lingering stress day in and day out, every day is brand new!

I got a pay increase from my old job as a teacher, but teachers don’t make much to begin with. Straight x-ray is more of an entry level job and that can be on the lower side being like $25-$30 an hour if you’re in a lower cost of living state. If you branch out into higher paying modalities like MRI or Cath Lab, you can make quite a bit more. My coworker who have about five years MRI experience all made six figures in a fairly low cost of living state.

This new generation of doctors in this digital age love imaging so the field is growing and wages are increasing to keep the field growing. A local hospital just raised their starting wage $5 an hour, so it’s definitely trending upwards!"

Small children with broken bones.. are not fun. They scream a lot. They cry a lot. They're scared. Running into the er when someone gets really badly injured and having to see and handle that.. isnt fun. It's traumatic. It was so overwhelming to me that I chose to drop out.

I’ve found the perfect ADHD-friendly career and I feel compelled to share,"I was briefly in competitive intelligence within a health insurance company's corporate strategy team. Doing research on trends and initiatives within the healthcare industry and the company's competitors. It was all of the boring parts with even fewer rewards. I hated the subject matter, I procrastinated more than I ever had in my life on writing the reports. The only fun part was giving presentations, as I'm trained in public speaking. I know presentations suck as a rule but mine do not because I hate everybody else's. It's fun to put on a little show.

That job was the stepping stone from being a college librarian (research, teaching, public service, sys admin, digital curator but the same year after year after year for very little pay for the education I acquired) and becoming a data engineer.

Data Engineering is incredibly satisfying for my brain. Always working on something different. Building a web of familiarity across my domain. Sitting like a fat happy spider waiting for my web to twitch while on call. Orchestrating patterns of activity and watching things flow. Spotting needles in haystacks that break those patterns. Working from home with my dogs and my garden.

I get to plan big initiatives for other people to help carry out. And best of all it's somebody else's job to make sure everybody's work gets across the finish line. And yet another person's to help us figure out what we need to get it done.

Instead of being overwhelmed by the tedium of a task, I get to consume those things in bite sizes, doing them just long enough before my interest wanes. Plus, I'm pretty sure 90% of engineers have ADHD so that's a bonus. I'm incredibly open about it at work and my team lead, project manager, and business analyst all help us keep the big goals in mind."

I started to get depressed, also because I worked abroad and didn't have much of a life outside of science. My coworkers and boss were great though, so nothing bad about the work environment in that lab. Which can also be quite different in this field. 

What I loved about it is working on your own project, so not dependent on coworkers. Also, we'd have flexible work times. Start a bit later, stay a bit later. Go home an hour earlier, no problem, just make it up another day.

We all do 2 years of solely x-ray with maybe one class of modalities education but that is it.

I live and was educated in a rural state where almost every technologist I’ve been around has multiple modality licenses. In smaller hospitals, many of them bounce between them on any given day. They would be in mammo one day, then CT the next, then X-ray the day after. Although I know some techs who stayed in their one modality, this was the experience of probably over half of the techs I ran into. And every single one of them did their training in those modalities on the job. When I was getting ready to graduate, one job offer I had was to learn CT for two years and then learn MRI so I could do all three.

I am sorry you find radiology so unhappy within the field, I truly am. The vast majority of people I know who work as rad techs are very happy, and if they’re not, they go to work as a rep or in applications, or they move workplaces to find a place that suits them. There are bad coworkers everywhere you go, that’s part of life. But for me, this career is something I’m passionate about so that can get me through working with just about anyone!"
I’ve found the perfect ADHD-friendly career and I feel compelled to share,"Radiologists will be using more ai support in the coming years I would imagine

Radiographers you would need a robot capable of gently moving people with injuries etc and will likely be hard to replace short term as people are illogical and don't follow instructions well. By the time the job is replaced by ai, most others will have been as well if I had to guess."

I’ve found the perfect ADHD-friendly career and I feel compelled to share,"Problem solving and critical thinking my middle names. The patient can’t move into the position you need, how do you adjust the patient and equipment to get the desired image? Your patient is large with two hip replacements, how do you adjust your technique to accommodate? It’s not AT ALL just pushing a button, there is a ton that goes into every image. And nothing makes me more satisfied than when the image comes out perfect after all of that hard work. Hello instant gratification 🤌🏼"
I’ve found the perfect ADHD-friendly career and I feel compelled to share,So I did a good chunk of my CS masters on medical imaging AI and have rad techs in the family- at the very least you'll still need techs to manhandle uncooperative patients into position and human radiologists in the loop for liability reasons and edge cases.

I’ve found the perfect ADHD-friendly career and I feel compelled to share,"Definitely not. I think, like every other career, AI has the potential to assist with making things faster, but it’s way too variable for AI. If a patient is able to stand, is flexible, and is in no pain and can perfectly move into position, then maybe AI could do that, but 90% of our patients require us to think outside the box to achieve images. I’d also love to see AI try and handle the 3AM drug user who is noncompliant and aggressive, or the 90 year old with two broken hips.😂 In short, patients are far too variable for AI to handle."
I’ve found the perfect ADHD-friendly career and I feel compelled to share,"In some workplaces, radiographers take call so that inevitably does happen. But if you’re not on call or you don’t work somewhere with call, that isn’t a thing fortunately. They cannot legally force you to work beyond your contracted hours. I don’t take any call but I could see how taking a lot of call could harm your work/life balance. There are also outpatient facilities that employee many radiographers and none of them ever take call. 

If I’m on call, I’m still technically clocked in. But when I leave and am not on call, I’m completely clocked out and have a wonderful work/life balance.☺️"

You also have to be comfortable touching patients to position them. There are a lot of sick and very VERY smelly patients as well that could avert people. There is however a great deal of structure and consistency, a lot of satisfaction in small victories, and the lack of need to make and maintain long-standing patient relationships.

I’ve found the perfect ADHD-friendly career and I feel compelled to share,"I almost walked out of my job so many times during the peak of COVID. I think I was clinically insane. Lost like 30lbs due to the stress and the amount of work. I completely stopped doing any overtime, no matter what bonuses they dangled in front of me, and I haven’t done any since. All I care about now is my work/life balance. That was the nail in the coffin for working in a big trauma center for me. I hopped and hopped until I found something low volume after all that. 

Absolutely no other job I consider pays the bills as well though, not even the adjacent roles that aren’t patient-facing that I mentioned. And to be real… I am very good at it so it seems like a waste to abandon my experience. Sometimes I see my coworkers absolutely sucking or being rude to patients for no reason or straight up abusive and it makes me wanna hang on. 

And hey everybody takes bad pictures, even mean old dayshifters. They make big mistakes too. They just don’t don’t talk about it and laugh them off. You just make sure you’re covering your ass in that chart, throwing the uncooperative patient under the bus when necessary, quickly explaining why they are too injured to stay in position, best images possible, etc. And always move your machine when you can’t move your patient. Just give them 2 views 90 degrees from one another in the worst case scenario 👍.

I’ve found the perfect ADHD-friendly career and I feel compelled to share,"I know I’ve got a ton of complaints in my replies but I just don’t want it romanticized. People deserve the big picture. All work blows. But you could be making the same or less pay at a possibly dead-end desk job and feel utterly hopeless because it’s just mindless meetings and deadlines for things you don’t care about. People are worth caring about even if half the people are shite to you. It’s better than trying beat someone in sales or make a better presentation than Bob from accounting. 

I think the *biggest* takeaway is if you are in a life situation where you currently have somebody you can lean on for financial/shelter support you should take advantage of that and get trained/ educated for some type of work you can tolerate. Whatever allows you to break free and become fully independent. As people with ADHD we have to fight our natural urge to drop a job and learn something new if we want security and independence long term. If you don’t know what to do now and it’s starting to make your life lag, just *pick something* so you can gain experience and meet your goals. You can always change jobs later. If it happens to be hospital work, you can always work a special weekend program contract while you go back to school. Don’t be afraid to contact employers and ask to shadow somebody for career insight. 

At one point or another in our lives we are going to have to face either being in the hospital, or our loved ones being in the hospital. Maybe just for a stay, but eventually for end of life care too. This job does provide you with the knowledge to navigate that more smoothly than usual. 

I am not currently in a position where I’m coming home and taking care of a chronically sick person, but I do recognize my spouse may become chronically sick someday. I’d like to think my experience will ultimately be a benefit to me in that situation more than a hindrance. I think it would be emotionally awful regardless but there’s a lot more things I can tolerate these days because of my work."
I’ve found the perfect ADHD-friendly career and I feel compelled to share,"Sorry I wasn’t very clear. I went into community college the fall after high school while living with my grandparents. They convinced me I couldn’t handle full time college so I just worked and did general education courses. Once I got fed up with their opinions about my school work ethic and decided to do this I had to apply twice over a year to get in.

I did work while in school, and ultimately paid for the entire thing but I was primarily busting my ass at a tip-based food service job every weekend. I fought hard for tiny scholarships to help pay for books (pressure your scholarship office!) and in the last semester I quit my food job and lived frugally on my first (smallish) college loan so I could focus on studying for boards. My grandparents not charging me rent was a massive factor in a lot of my decisions. This all sounds great but it took me 5 years total due to my slow start. Plus I felt like a failure since all my buddies went off to party at universities which I never got to do. 

I know classmates that worked full time while doing it but I’m not quite sure how they managed it. One of my classmates was like 50 with a teen and he worked nights while doing class and clinical during the day and graduated and deserves extreme props for it. You don’t get a choice of when your classes are for a program like this. You are always with your classmates in the program, it’s never solo. Half the days you’re in class, half the days you’re training in the hospital. The ratio changes as you progress.

Sure it’s not nursing but I’m not gonna lie the courses are very challenging. But I was unmedicated for unfortunate reasons so I’m sure a medicated person can do it. After your first year, a lot of programs make you work an unpaid full time summer in the hospital before your next year starts. That’s the real burnout. After a few years of regular X-ray work I went on to learn CT since nobody can command you to come running with a machine, they have to come to your machine.

I’m being this specific because people like to act self-made and don’t acknowledge the help they receive along the way. I’m proud I managed to pay for my schooling but without my grandparents providing me a free place to live and food I’m not so sure I would have made it. But my class was filled with just as many adults making career changes as new students so it’s definitely possible! I definitely had to make a lot of sacrifices in my personal life at a vulnerable time to make it happen."

I was considering nursing. I can settle for something like this. And my mom was once a rad tech :)"
I’ve found the perfect ADHD-friendly career and I feel compelled to share,"First off, thank you for the response! 

Second, I am sorry  if my internal thought of “they must have such low stress” felt patronizing in any way. I’ve noticed the techs I have met recently seemed very balanced, friendly and zen. Those characteristics are exact opposite of the majority of people I work with, and a lot of the people the techs work with I see directly before or after them at the hospital (i.e. surgeons). 

Do techs typically work 5 days, 8 hours a day vs. 4 days, 10 hours? 

It seems like a job that allows the work day to end when you leave the office/hospital building. The idea of being totally off the clock seems like a luxury so few jobs have anymore."

I’ve found the perfect ADHD-friendly career and I feel compelled to share,"I’m an RN too. I started pediatric ICU and then did “float pool” (for non RNs this means you work wherever they need you that shift) and then ER.  Whenever I started in the ER, I felt like I “found my people.”  (I was so “normal” there because half of us have ADHD!). I loved that every day was different and the patients were different too.  I was always learning new skills/information.  And I was always assigned to the trauma bay because I THRIVE in high stress traumas and codes.  As a nurse I am clear headed, decisive and a good leader in those scenarios.    
However, I completely burned out.  Unfortunately, although I can perform my job exceptionally well during a stressful code, it’s not good for me mentally.  I process the trauma of it later—sometimes a particularly horrific code will hit me a week later. And we we horrible things: child abuse, people dying, motor vehicle crash victims, gun shot wound victims….        
It felt like a one-sided abusive relationship:   I was a good nurse but nursing was not good to me.  It did not take care of me and put me in dangerous situations. 

Also, I’m lucky I got out before I had a back injury (so many nurses have permanently screwed up their backs from lifting patients, etc).   
  
I recommend nursing to NOBODY, not even people I don’t like."

I’ve found the perfect ADHD-friendly career and I feel compelled to share,"It really depends on the size of the hospital/lab you work in. I worked in a medium sized hospital (about 300 beds) previously. The lab was physically pretty small, but each department was in its own little area and you don't really leave that area while you're doing your work. A decent chunk of working in Hematology involves sitting at a microscope and looking at slides of blood. Blood Bank also involves a good amount of manual testing with test tubes and such, so you're sitting at a workbench using your hands. There's a good amount of automation in the field, so departments like Chemistry are mostly just loading and unloading samples on and off the analyzer. Bigger hospitals tend to have more automation than smaller ones, but also have higher workloads because they have more patients. Very small hospitals might have the people performing the testing also be the ones drawing the blood from the patients, so then they're walking all over the hospital to do that as well as back to the lab to do the testing. I work in the Blood Bank of a large academic medical center (900 beds) now and it's a lot busier than the smaller hospital I used to work at so there's a lot more standing and walking back and forth or around the lab to do various tasks. As far as heavy lifting goes, there isn't too much of that sort of thing."

I’ve found the perfect ADHD-friendly career and I feel compelled to share,"Really happy advertising works for you, I have a very different experience so just thought I’d comment and provide another perspective for anyone reading and considering:

I have ADHD and work in advertising and I want to leave, I find it soooo easy to get burnt out. Even if I have time at the end of a day, I’m often too tired and emotionally drained. Although there are periods when it’s not as bad, it’s hard to predict when these times will be as you’re at your client’s whim and they often hit you with last minute curveballs and requests. We don’t have project managers where I work (maybe that’s the key difference!) so there’s a lot of managing our own deadlines and really fast paced work; having ADHD I tend to leave things to the last minute and have this perpetual feeling that I’m letting people down. I also find dealing with corporate clients and being at their whims super stressful. Maybe it’s a personal thing, but I also get mega impostor syndrome and suffer from perfectionism, I’m constantly second guessing myself and it feels like I’m losing a game that I don’t even want to be playing, because ultimately I don’t care about what I’m doing. But you have to ACT like you’re super passionate and love this job or you won’t get far. And that’s exhausting. Plus, lots of days ARE boring spent at a desk."
I’ve found the perfect ADHD-friendly career and I feel compelled to share,"I have and did not like the thought. Because most advertisement plays into stereotypes to appeal to the wise masses and -obviously- tries to sell people things. I don’t want to make ads for products and companies I personally don’t endorse and even less do I want to make something which has the ultimate goal of profit. Advertisement seems most restrictive than any other way of making art.

I’ve found the perfect ADHD-friendly career and I feel compelled to share,"Not really. By hospital politics as it relates to ultrasound… stupid tests are ordered. Tests that aren’t needed. Tests for things ultrasound can’t even diagnose- because of insurance, because the doctor says so- etc. If you have good radiologists and managers who will back you up this can be helped but even still there is A LOT done that isn’t needed. Plus patients come in unprepped for their exams making them essentially non-diagnostic but we have to do it anyways because we can’t get bad patient scores. Again a good manager helps.

It’s not horrible but it can wear on you and create cynicism. Especially if like me just doing your job causes pain. Anything unnecessary is that much more annoying haha.

I’ve found the perfect ADHD-friendly career and I feel compelled to share,"OP is confusing it with actual radiologist doctors. Rad Tech is doing all the practical elements and interactions with the patient. The radiology docs on the other hand never come in contact with patients; their role is to read, and interpret the images that the techs take. 

The fear of radiologists losing out to AI is because given the nature of the role (reading images), it’s prime for feeding AI large data sets who can then make accurate readings that a human might miss out on. 

TLDR: Point is if a role requires your hands and human interactions you’re safe — making Rad Tech a pretty safe bet regarding the AI aspect"

I’ve found the perfect ADHD-friendly career and I feel compelled to share,"Omg I’m in public health too! Currently doing my MPH. I don’t see my field being mentioned here a lot so this got me excited lol. 

I’m working for a huge longitudinal research project and I HATE IT. I’ve made several posts about but it’s a project with over 20k participants and we’re responsible for the recruiting, booking ppl and managing calls AS WELL AS doing the data collection when participants arrive. We literally have to split our days so our evenings are doing appointments with the ppl and mornings are answering calls, emails, booking and reviewing the data. I got into a really bad place because it felt like all my work was going nowhere and found no meaning in what I did. I also really struggled with finishing everything I had to do before my appointments bc you really never know what type of email or phone call you get plus I had to prepare for the appointments In the evening. So by the time it’s 3:30 I’m rushing to go to the clinic for appointments with several tasks unfinished and the cycle continues. I had to speak with my supervisor and tell her I couldn’t handle it so I have one less day with appointment. Oh also I’m in full time school 🤣 

Every part of this job is terrible for me mostly bc I need to see results of my work but I didn’t have that. I could spend my whole day working so hard but nothing to show for it.. I had to take a couple months off because of the overwhelm and I’m currently looking at other jobs. I’ve done research jobs before and I genuinely enjoyed it because I was responsible only for the data collection and got to make connections with the people I was with. Make a report and be done with that. But this research job I have is something else.. I do like having different tasks but the level of task switching involved at this job is more than my brain could handle. For me there’s a fine line between the right amount of variety to being overwhelmed. Plus all those never ending projects and deadlines and pressure is what is really affecting me. 

I cannot stress enough how important it is for anyone but especially those with adhd to find a job that you at least enjoy 80% of the time. After my shift I would be in such bad moods and spend my time doing absolutely nothing just to cope. Theres too much of an impact on your life that isn’t worth it. My job didn’t only affect 40 hours of my week. It affected my whole life.



EDIT: 
I just wanted to mention while I hate this research job, I love the field of public health. Im doing my masters and my undergrad was also in this field so it’s something I rly enjoy. I was a health educator/promoter for the same company and I LOVED IT SO MUCH. My adhd brain loved it!! This was the perfect mix of tasks as I got to do what I was passionate about. It was a bit of designing posters for health care professionals, a bit of social media planning, a bit of community engagement as well as project management. And it paid more. But sadly it was a short contract. For me this type of work doesn’t feel at all like a job bc it’s stuff I did years ago when volunteering and it felt meaningful. With research that component was a huge missing piece. I’m hoping to find more roles that allow me to do this.

So if you’re in public health maybe look into this as well if you like having that meaningful part of your job. I know others prefer not so data and research works well too so it depends on what works for you."
I’ve found the perfect ADHD-friendly career and I feel compelled to share,"So my degree is in advertising. I have no formal education in safety and just fell into it.

I generally like talking to and interacting with people. At my last job One guy told me I was the only safety guy people liked ""because I made it clear it was just a job to me and I wasn't a Total dick."" So I've got that going for me.

I’ve found the perfect ADHD-friendly career and I feel compelled to share,"It's situational and depends on the dataset. Often, I would start by root cause analysis of why it sucks to begin with (especially if it's still coming in so crummy), if they need historical data i'd orchestrate a plan to correct it - if it's only working transactions we'd work on improving the process as to how it's coming in.

Following this it's data cleansing, trimming,  getting rid of white space and making use of grouping functions where possible. 

Analyzing is typically by way of making data actionable,  I do that by understanding the basic needs of the business area (why would I make a dashboard that doesn't get to the action needed to be taken by the end user? Much less than that, and I'm just telling the news). 

A lot of people suck at this... I'll be fair, they do what the business asks for (a number/metric) but I shoot for the end goal... ""Charles's production output is low""  put that front and center, don't show them the good stuff... why do people focus on metrics that show businesses how good they are? You can't fix problems with good numbers...

I’ve found the perfect ADHD-friendly career and I feel compelled to share,"Truthfully, being a librarian has almost 100% translated into data engineering. It is spiritually the same. I curate a collection of information that is easily navigable for our clients to locate what they need to design their own reports. I'm not a data analyst, nor a data scientist. It's my job to make sure THOSE folks have clean data to work with.

I have talked about my career transition pretty extensively in my post history if you want a deep dive, but to sum it all up, first I learned the language R which gave me a solid foundation in the structure of data. Then I got my feet wet with data visualization tools at the healthcare job. Tableau and Power BI. I casually studied the basics of graphic design which translates nicely to data design. It's all about storytelling.

Eventually, I got a lead on the company I work for now and brushed up on SQL. R is like more readable SQL so I already knew the concepts. I just needed to know the syntax better. I also played with python a bit which I'm starting to use even more now.

I am entirely self taught on this path. I used sites like DataCamp and HackerRank. The stuff I didn't have a handle on, I learned along the way. The soft skills I brought from 10 years professional experience has helped me pole vault up the ladder from where I started. I'm coming up on 2 years as an engineer and I've received 2 promotions and INCREDIBLY substantial raises, outpacing those on the team with degrees in these subjects.

Programming isn't really about knowing how to do absolutely everything. It's about having the kind of brain that can combine what you know is possible with solid problem solving and googling skills to arrive at an answer.

For what it's worth, I'm also the girl on the team. I think because we have such a solid support team (which I helped curate), I'm not treated as the admin assistant but I'm also very tight with those folks and it has gone a long way in helping the team develop and fire on all cylinders. I can talk to them without talking over them, as many engineers are prone to do. I also have helped these nerds talk about their feelings in nonconfrontational ways. There are pros to leaning on the Girl Skills while finding ways to set boundaries with the Girl Burdens."

Ok, I hope so. The process scored us based on our grades in the prerequisites/ gen eds plus whatever we scored on the essay, all hidden values. Based on that they cut 300 applicants to 100 and interviewed them. Then cut 100 applicants to 30 based on interviews. 

The interviewers have likely been a part of the process for *years* and have heard every sappy “I’ve always wanted to help sick people UwU” story you can imagine.

I know one person who walked into full time out of school and that was just fantastic timing/dumb luck on his part.

I also know many more who have to work 2-3 jobs to get adequate hours

Hospitals love having part time staff they don't have to pay benefits to. I watched full time positions disappear and get split into part time as people retired.

If you are willing to move for work you will have better luck securing full time as there will likely be understaffed rural hospitals hiring."

I’ve found the perfect ADHD-friendly career and I feel compelled to share,"Self confidence is under-discussed imo. Being out of practice and feeling confident is challenging for many of us with ADHD. You are obviously confident with your current job, met the qualifications of the educational and practicum, therefore it’s that feeling and doubt that are creating hesitation. 

Perhaps there’s a way to volunteer - spend time mirroring someone who works in those jobs to improve your sense of self confidence? I know, not an easy thing to navigate when one has a child(ren) and possibly family. If even possible it may be worthwhile making the sacrifice together to refresh your experience. Plus it will be viewed highly favourably by hiring managers/institutions. Increasing your current experience in an area of interest and entering into applying for the job will place you in a very positive favourable light. You will also feel confident and do well in an interview. Ideally, if possible, you may be hired by the location you are getting the experience."

I’ve found the perfect ADHD-friendly career and I feel compelled to share,"Another MPHer checking in 🙋‍♀️ I absolutely hated longitudinal research while doing my MPH and it was actually around the same time I was diagnosed with ADHD. I was fascinated with public health but would struggle with long term projects and research. I did an epi program because it seemed the most exciting, but the downfall of that was needing to start at lower paying entry level public health professions. A lot of which are not very exciting and can take awhile to be promoted at. I also had a lot of student loans to pay off so I knew it would be tough to accept an an entry level PH position. I wish I enjoyed biostatistics a bit more since that can definitely be a higher starting salary. 

Anyways, I ended up getting into Medical writing/ clinical trial transparency and I love it! I get to work with a variety of different protocols, clinical study reports, and plain language summaries at a time which keeps things interesting. Different activities/assignments can take anywhere from an hour to a few months, but from an ADHDers perspective the timelines are not that hard to manage. At the end of the day it is rewarding to know I am helping make scientific research & clinical trials more comprehensible for people without science backgrounds. I use my MPH knowledge to understand the material ( for example complex study designs, statistical significance of results, different populations being studied) and then condense it down to an 6th grade reading level.

I love public health too!! It’s so fascinating to read about but I have decided I can’t work in it. I am a health inspector so the work I do is very much boots on the ground. One would think it would keep my brain happy but it’s just to drawn out and the number of deadlines isn’t good for me. I’m stressed most of the time because I am not allowed to take the time I feel is needed to fix the problem, I have to keep things moving. We don’t have enough employees to deeply cover the work and we are CONSTANTLY having to train new people because people quit all the time. I honestly love when I get to train new employees. That’s the best part of my job but that’s only a few days out of a year. They used to have a training officer position but they got rid of it.

also I read recently that there are a lot of BI people out there getting laid off and looking for work elsewhere, so that makes the job hunt super competitive. That's a result of people pivoting to BI during the pandemic, I guess.

But basically: learn some SQL and potentially a prog language like Python or R (learn how to extract and manipulate datasets), and get some experience with BI tools like Tableau and Power Bi, Qlik, etc. Some/most have free trials you can take advantage of, and Power BI is a microsoft product you may already have access to. Google has some courses offered through a partnership with coursera that could be pretty good for building a skillset all at once. I have a friend doing that and they have good things to say about it. Query skills are built by doing; start small and build. It's best to have something to show.

I don't know if they have anything in USA similar although when I did an internship in US working for the trustees of reservations was very similar!

I’ve found the perfect ADHD-friendly career and I feel compelled to share,"Now YOU have described my entire life from a completely new perspective. It's incredibly frustrating when people expect me to ""just keep it moving"" while unfinished tasks are left behind, and then expect me to remember to follow up and complete them. They don't understand that with ADHD, it's extremely difficult to remember small details if I'm not given reminders to remember them. So when I'm at my desk, I'm constantly anxious because there are a million things on my mind. I have so many tools to help me remember things that my coworkers think I'm crazy. I use a whiteboard, five notebooks, sticky notes, several apps, and calendars. And yet, even with all of that, I still end up forgetting things. For example, today I had a physio appointment, and I completely forgot about it and arrived late because I had so many other things on my mind.

I don't want to rant all day, but I could if I wanted to. So I completely understand where you're coming from and I GET YOU. 

I've invested a lot of time and money trying to keep up, but I'm slowly realizing that this isn't the right fit for me. It took a lot to come to this realization because at first, what got to me was how effortlessly others could do it, while I struggled miserably. Especially the new hire who came on just a week before me. I always felt like I was behind and slowing down the team, even though I knew for a fact that I was putting in the most effort. I started to see myself as a failure, and my mind was filled with negative thoughts about myself. It took two months of restoring, resting, and realigning with my passions and purpose to get me back on track. I know this very well as I’ve been there for 6 months now with 2 of those months being off due to overwhelm and an accident. I was doing so well before this job, and I was doing well during my time off, so it was crystal clear that the job was the issue.

What also made me realize it wasn't for me was when it began to impact my health in practical ways. I couldn't schedule my therapy sessions due to a lack of time and overwhelm. I couldn't plan my personal training sessions either because I had to work evenings, and my gym doesn't offer morning sessions. I couldn’t take my simple mental health drive and/or walks (I do these regularly to calm my mind and process heavy thoughts). I haven’t done that since my time off back in February when I used to do it every single day. These may seem like small things, but I had a really good thing going on before this job, and my mental health was at an excellent stage. I felt in control on bad days, whereas now, I feel like managing my mental health is like walking on eggshells. One wrong move, and I break down, so I've been in survival mode. This has made me hostile, and I've never seen this side of myself since I started working intentionally on my mental health.

I couldn't even meal prep because I wasn't in the mood, and all I craved was junk food to make me feel better. I've done a lot of work on myself, and a big indicator that things are going badly is when I start going to drive-thrus more frequently. Well, three weeks into the job, and I was already going multiple times a week. For context, I rarely crave junk food on a regular day. So This isn't normal for me at all, where going out to dinner with friends a couple of times a month was the most I would do.

So while these things may seem small, they really aren't. Exercising, meal prepping, meditating/prayer and therapy are the foundation of my well-being. And if my job is preventing me from doing the bare minimum to keep myself healthy, then it's an obstacle that simply isn't worth it!

Thanks if you’re still reading. I’m sorry to hear your negative experiences at your job. I would 1000% suggest you leave as well. This life is too short and I would never spend it on an environment/place/job that’s making you miserable. It’s not worth it when there are so  many more opportunities that exist!

I’ve found the perfect ADHD-friendly career and I feel compelled to share,"It’s not necessarily about “finding” it. Its more of reflecting and looking inwardly to see which areas you are completely focused and willing to give all your attention to. We do not have an attention deficit rather we can give loads of attention to something we are deeply interested in. Usually it’s something you value and something you deeply enjoy and meaningful to you. It’s not about searching and seeking all night and day for these hidden strengths. Rather it’s about being who YOU are wholeheartedly. How do you do that specifically? 

You reflect on moments of flow: Recall instances in your life when you felt completely absorbed in an activity and lost track of time. These moments of ""flow"" often indicate areas where your natural talents and interests lie. Reflect on what you were doing during those times and consider how you can incorporate similar elements into your career or personal projects. 

Be open to learning about those parts of you. Sometimes we get so caught up in the happenings of life that we forget about the things that make us come alive. If you find that you lack that, carve out some time to create more opportunities for that. You might just not have many moments of just being present in the here and now. As weird as it might be, we sometimes need to be intentional to create that. If you still can’t think of anything try, try and try. Sometimes it’s a case of throwing things and seeing what sticks. Eventually you’ll land on something where you want to get to the root of it - And that’s where things get exciting."

Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"I would say that my experience has been more that it has opened the door for me to *choose* to be a better person.

I can still decide to waste my day on reddit or some other unproductive thing, but I can more easily choose to work on a project or clean a room or do something else I mentally want to do but emotionally don't feel like doing *right now*.

Do a little experiment: make a short list of only a few things you want to do each day.  They need to be well-defined tasks that aren't so big you feel like avoiding them.  For example: ""spend at least 10 minutes cleaning the bathroom"" or ""exercise for at least 10 minutes"" or ""wash at least 5 dishes"".

My experience is usually that I don't want to do the thing at first, but I want to be able to check off my list so I get started and only intend to do the 10 minutes I committed to.  But once I'm doing the thing I end up getting momentum doing it and have to be careful not to get hyperfocused on it (especially on ritalin).  Getting started is easier on ritalin, but still requires that effort.

As for distraction I definitely feel you.  It's challenging for me to do a task like ""clean X room for Y minutes"" because I am easily distracted by other cleaning-related tasks.  Example: take out trash -> consolidate trash from bathroom -> clean bathroom so I can throw out smelly cleaning wipes -> ... -> finally take out trash after cleaning almost every room for several hours.

Ritalin does not magically make me impervious to that behavior, but I do feel like I have more power to choose to resist the distraction - especially if I have another task to do that I'd fail if I lose focus.  It almost feels like I have noticed that I have a new muscle that is weak from disuse, but it is there and needs to be exercised.

In my experience meds have helped me *actually implement* tips and techniques for dealing with ADHD (like this short todo list).  Maybe try to find techniques and tools to help you, and see if the meds make them work better than when you've tried in the past.

Meds give us more executive function, but we still have to use that function, and direct it where it needs to go.  Pills don't teach skills, as they say."

Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"I take Vyvanse and felt the same disappointment at first because I wanted it to 'fix' me but I still need all my strategies/systems/hacks to be even remotely productive, even when I know that it's working, otherwise I can waste entire days accomplishing absolutely nothing.

The difference, for me, is that the medication makes it way, way easier to actually implement the strategies/systems/hacks that I rely on to keep my life in order. I rarely have to get into a mental wrestling match with myself every time I need to start/switch tasks. I don't forget what I was doing/planning to do every time I get distracted for even a brief moment - only sometimes. I'm far less likely to snooze/dismiss my alarms and reminders without actually doing the thing. I don't feel so exhausted by the end of the day that I can be brought to the verge of tears by having to decide which type of pasta sauce to pour from the jar into the saucepan.

Meds can't rewire my brain - it is the way it is, and I've had to learn to accept that. But they do make it way less exhausting to do what I need to get done. If you're not getting that from Ritalin, it's possible that one of the other ADHD medications would work better. There are a lot of options out there!"
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"Meds are not going to magically change your entire life by transforming you into a perfectly organized type A. 


You need to do some self introspection to figure out WHAT is distracting you and then you can find ways to work around it. 


I have a meeting with my boss every week to go over data and plan for the next week. I make a new word document for every meeting and type EVERYTHING out. I have a folder on my desktop where I save those meeting notes. I keep the notes from the previous week’s meeting open all week and mark everything I’ve finished. 


The day before my meeting I make a new file that is a point by point breakdown of everything I’ve done and I make additional notes. 


Every meeting file has a separate “update” file. This might seem excessive for people but it is what works for me. You need to figure out your own system."
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"Here's how it helped me.

I used to get glued to the couch. I would tell myself to start doing something. I would try to force myself to do it. It took so long to overcome it, and when I would get up, my whole body would hurt. Like actual physical pain. The entire time I'd be doing whatever I needed to do, my body and mind would be fighting me. I'd get brain fog, confusion, distraction, and end up mentally exhausted and overwhelmed.

Ritalin took the pain and fight away. ADHD exhausts my brain very quickly. A day at work would sap my ability to deal with anything else. With the meds, I no longer feel exhausted. Thing is, it's not a cure for laziness. I still have days where I just don't want to do anything and it's hard to get motivated. But on meds, that's a couple times a week instead of six months straight between ""good days.""

You still need to get motivated and have discipline. The meds I feel put me on an even footing with everybody else to develop those things. You still need to work, but this makes the work possible."
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,Same boat here. Thought I would be much more organized and focused with Ritalin.
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"DEFINITELY talk with your doctor first, but I was feeling like this at first too when I first got medicated (on concerta), and I decided to try increasing my dosage because I was on a pretty low amount. It helps a lot more, I think I might need to increase one more time potentially but it really made a difference. That was just me tho, not everyone needs just an increase in their dosage to find the 'magic cure', but that has been my experience so far at least"
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"I sort of had a bit of a reverse of this? And yes, it genuinely sucks when the meds just don't work. My first few days on Vyvanse I felt like I could fight god and had such amazing control of my attention & productivity. My RSD was virtually non-existent. I got so much done! ...and then the mouth tics got so severe I had to go off the meds after like 3 days because I'd shredded the sides of my tongue. Nothing else even came *close*. The non-stimulants did nothing but make me feel like garbage, so we tried different stimulants. After being on Adderall for a while, we decided to try the Vyvanse again, same dose as the first time...and now it does virtually nothing for me. Just a baseline awakeness so I'm not a total zombie.

I hate that I felt that moment of what it *could* be like, to have those chemicals firing properly, to be productive and feel in control...only to have it snatched away. Sometimes I wonder if it would've been better if the meds had just not worked at all. At least I wouldn't know what I'm missing..."
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,Ritalin helps me a lot with the permanent lack of energy and social interaction. With actual work not so much. It’s easier but not a massive difference
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"Based on what you posted, it's possible you just don't respond well to Ritalin. Ask to switch to Adderall and see if it works any different."
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"Disappointment is a functional emotion. Anger and guilt are not. 

Sit with the feeling of disappointment and allow yourself to fully experience it.

I started the meds about 7 weeks ago. And things didn't go as I hoped either. I did 3 weeks of Concerta (Ritalin). Moved to Elvanse 30 mg for another 3 weeks. Then up to 50 mg of Elvanse this Monday.

Concerta was genuinely horrible for me and I felt the same disappointment you're feeling. I had maybe 2 or 3 days where I could focus a bit, but it was mostly headaches and brain fog. I was also angry, irritable and irrational throughout the experience.

But then I sat with those emotions, journaled a bit and meditated. It really helped me regain perspective and accept myself."
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"Medication isn’t magic. My med significantly improve my life, but I still have to work to develop skills and habits that I just couldn’t without meds. It’s best to start small, and it takes time. My first goal was to start putting trash actually in the trash can. I do a lot better now, but still struggle with it."
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"Is this your first medication for ADHD? Talk to your prescriber about it if you still feel like your symptoms are out of control. 

I actually am in the opposite situation right now. A few weeks ago I was prescribed Adderall and it worked wonders (I wasn’t euphoric, just functional and less overwhelmed). Then I was switched to Concerta (long-acting Ritalin) and I feel the exact same as before stimulants. Today I even doubled my dose (which is NOT okay lol. Do as I say not as I do. I think I only did it because my impulsive symptoms are back!) and I still feel no difference, good or bad.

No idea why my provider made the switch when Adderall worked, but I’m going to update her in my next appointment. I also want to note I’m not implying Adderall will be the same for you. I’m just saying there’s probably something better if you are disappointed in your results.

Just keep trying! Discuss things with your prescriber. If you are still feeling symptoms strongly enough that they prevent you from feeling capable of getting better, you deserve to find something that does allow you to."
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,It’s probably because of how Ritalin works. It’s basically Wellbutrin that doesn’t need to build up in the system to be effective. It’s only an reuptake inhibitor. Maybe you have too much MAO and that’s degrading any benefit of dopamine that can build up in the synaptic cleft or you just don’t make enough catecholamines. Selegeline patches work for that but probably just try a releasing agent like an amphetamine derivative.
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,Adderall screwed me up for a good 6 months. The up wasn’t sustainable and I was up and down daily. It was hard to live like that.
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"I stopped my Concerta because it didn't help in the ways I was hoping and it was making my depression worse. Haven't noticed a change in my executive function since coming off it, if anything I might be doing better? 

I have found that getting good sleep has been the most important factor in my ability to function. That and making sure I don't forget to eat and drink has helped me survive th past 2 weeks off my stimulant."
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,Medication just makes it easier to do the inner work
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"I don’t have anything positive to add here besides “Please listen to your therapist or prescriber, they would have told you this”"
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"Ritalin will only incrementally help you. You may still need to tweak the dosage a bit (it took me awhile to find the correct dose) but if you can notice that it's making a difference, that's the start of you improving.

Remember that ADHD and other mental health issues go hand in hand. It may be worth speaking with a therapist, and if you can't afford that and you feel bad or anxious about things, learn how to do mindfulness activities to help redirect your unproductive negative thoughts.

Remember, this is a long-term battle - probably a lifelong one. But small improvements can accumulate, and then the mindset starts to change, and then you'll really start to notice a difference.

Ritalin and good mental health won't ever make unpleasant things feel pleasant or even neutral, but they will reduce your resistance to doing the unpleasant things."
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"My experience was the opposite. 

I wasn't expecting much to happen but it almost immediately felt like I was finally in the driver's seat. Simultaneously, it felt totally normal - like it'd never been different. 

Then it was all very suddenly taken away and it's like I'm not taking anything at all. Now I don't know what to do.

In any case, the drug didn't make me a better person. It just gave me power to become a better person. Resolving our issues, it's still down to us."
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"I've only tried two non stimulant meds and both were different in the aspects of my ADHD that they improved on.
My memory was great on one and mediocre on the other. But my ability to start and finish projects is better with the latter over the other.
But both weren't very effective with watching movies and paying attention. 
But they both gave me the ability to keep my train of thought while having conversations and not getting lost in my thoughts. Which is what's important to me. 

With that said, what I've learned so far is that you're not going to get a med that will just eliminate your ADHD. Meds will HELP. 
You just have to find the one that suits you the best."
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,">I know this is stupid, but I guess I was secretly, hoping that Ritalin would unlock some dormant part of me that would pull it together.

In a way, it does and it doesn't. I would describe my experience as follows: it gave me the clarity, focus, and headspace to be able to regulate myself better, which in turn freed up a lot of time and energy that I could put into ""catching up"" (for a lack of a better word). It didn't make me a better person, it allowed me to become the person I was always meant to be, and when I say that, I'm strictly speaking in terms of functioning, not personality. That shit took some time, though, and it's probably still an ongoinng process."
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"Meds are like a walking stick to your brain, Not a wheelchair that someone else pushes. 

It's a hard pill to swallow (no pun intended) but you still gotta put some work into yourself to actually be productive. For me To-Do Lists work pretty much like a charm plus listening to Music during my tasks. I know it sounds like bad advice but it's personally what I learned from being on my meds for a few weeks now. 
For me Ritalin helps me make those to-do lists and accomplish them.
If I don't have any plans or lists on my tasks I am still not really able to do them. 

Plus I think coffee isn't really a good thing...I heard it somewhere but both are stimulants...but if you don't have any bad side effects because of it great but be careful. I heard it's bad for the heart. 

If this doesn't help, tell those issues your psychiatrist."
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"I heard somewhere that adhd treatment is like a three legged stool. Medication is one leg, coaching is another and therapy is the third. All three together provide stability that one or two just can’t. Honestly, in my experience, I’m seeing much better progress with all three. Like you logically I knew medication alone wasn’t going to ‘fix’ me but I also couldn’t help but feel disappointed not to have a magic wand, despite knowing its unrealistic.  Now I’m grateful for the part each element plays together. It’s still not perfect but I can get more done more easily now a bit further down the road. There is hope so don’t give up."
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"i kind of understand that but more in a… i don’t know how i’m supposed to feel or what is supposed to be, i don’t know, changed? when i’m on medication. like i take ritalin but i don’t feel that much of a difference, my dose was increased over time (i take 40mg now) and it’s just the same as when i started. and it’s hard because i tried to explain that it’s better than nothing but also it barely does anything and the psychiatrist wondered if i wasn’t getting my expectations too high about medication. i don’t think i am i don’t expect medication to do everything, it’s just that, ritalin seems to barely scratch the surface even on a higher dose. i don’t know what is medication supposed to change exactly but i do know that i am/feel almost the same when i take ritalin, again, even as the dose increased. it’s such a complicated process because you have to find a way to talk about it that makes sense and won’t make the doctor think you want x or y medication plus other medications are way too expensive"
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,Try taking more ?
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"If you take the entire bottle at once, you can walk to Iowa then have a heart attack and die. 

That probably wouldn’t make you a better person either."
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,I really wanted the Vyvanse and then the Adderall to make me a better parent with endless patience and it did not happen like that lol
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,Have you tried the Adderall side of stimulants. Concerta (Ritalin but extended release) worked ok with me (but didn’t make me all that focused) so I took the option of exploring the other side
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"For some reason I felt the same about Ritalin and told my doctor I wanted to give it a try. I was also disappointed when I found out it wasn’t working for me. I recall thinking something along the lines of, “wtf” and throwing my hands in the air"
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,Ritalin is great!
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,Only vynvanse works for me.
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,[removed]
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"Honestly this is more or less what I said to my doc after I started Ritalin. No miracles, it’s working as well as it’s reasonable to expect, etc. Fortunately he was a specialist and said “NOPE that ain’t it, let’s try something else” and goddamn he was correct. 

I’m obviously NOT a specialist but please don’t settle for this."
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"Felt this exact same disappointment 

I wonder if we need to switch to a different class

It just made me a little more focused and motivated 

Nothing ground breaking

I think if I took this younger it would have completely changed my life"
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"Can they not put you on a long lasting methylphenidate slow release I’m on 45mg a day with a fast release top up from about 4pm it’s helping me loads 
I would go for de caff though coffee and alcohol can stop the meds working properly"
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,Ritalin sucks for me. I didn't feel good until vyvanse. Generic soon!!
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"You know, it might be starting to work - as you're catching up to your own bullshit. 

Just remember your medication is just meant to unshackle your hands and feet and brain - but now it's up to you to actually toil and walk and plan."
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,Try vyvanse or elvanse depending on where you live. It's helped me tremendously. Ritalin didn't do anything for me but elvanse is amazing
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"I’ve been on Ritalin, Ritalin LA, Adderall XR, and they are all very different and for me, Vyvanse is better by a million miles. Try another med before you give up. It’s changed my life. 

Having said that, you gotta do behavior mod as well. Meds are just one tool to improving your productivity."
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"Ah this was my experience too... I think people expect too much from meds. BUT what's great is now you'll probably find it easier to form better habits. Progress may still be slow, it has been for me. I've been on meds for around 2 years and I'm probably still worse than average in terms of productivity and having my shit together, but I'm slowly catching up to my peers and honestly I'm pretty happy about that."
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"In my experience, it did unlock the dormant part of me with superpowers. I am focusing on being able to learn new things fast, and it totally works, but the pill by itself is not what makes it happen.

Do not give up. Talk to your doctor about not getting the expected results. Also do a lot of research yourself and listen to other doctors too.

I have been on medication (concerta) for 5 months. Initially I felt like my mind could stop having racing thoughts, so it gave me peace and also the ability to choose what I want to focus on. I always knew that medication was not going to be the only thing necessary for me to unlock the superpowers, so along the way I have been doing a lot of self-reflexion, meditation, talking to my support circle, reading a ton of books about emotions and psychology. For example I have learnt this concept of letting go. I have let go the need for my parents to love me (as my mom recently died, and realized my dad thinks I am too much to handle) and instead replaced it with self-love. I have also let go the desire to push my partner into meeting my expectations. I have let go the picture of my perfect family and friends that I was pursuing. I have let go a lot of things that aren't physical, and it's hard to see how you are grasping onto those things. Besides letting go, there is a ton of things I've learned from reading about emotions, people, human brain, society. And I am applying them all constantly into my life. 

In short, **the pill allowed me to focus on maturing**. Maturing was a concept that I was not able to understand before. What is the difference between young people and mature people? It is the ability to self-regulate your emotions in order to stay in control. For people with ADHD and/or autism, emotional self-regulation is one of the biggest challenges that they will face in life. I could not understand anything about people before, and that has changed dramatically.

&#x200B;

So don't expect the pill to unlock the dormant you by itself. You also need to be in control of your body and mind, and you need to learn everything about yourself that you were not able to learn due to the issues that ADHD was causing. Make a plan and start today, you will know you improved when other people start telling you that something is different about yourself. And one day, your feelings will tell you that you have unlocked your inner self."
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,Medication just helps to relieve symptoms it is still recommended that adhd patients go for some type of cbt therspy ( cognitive behaviour therapy) this in conjunction with your medication will be of greater help. Miracle pills dont exist. And maybe ritalin isnt the right med. I take vyvanse i used to take methylphenidate( ritalin) and found it did nothing for me. Vyvanse(lisdexamphetamime) has helped alot more with focus and memory recall. I still have alot of adhd symptoms but i tackle that with therapy. Hope this helps you. Good luck on your journey to better mental health
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"I feel like my medication is a tool, not a cure. It's up to me to use it to its full potential. That said, you could always try talking to your doctor about increasing your dose or trying a different medication. Everyone's body is different, and will react differently to different medications and dosages"
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"It still takes work. A lot of it is building up new habits and thought patterns. It is still hard, but the meds might make it possible to begin with. You can still get there."
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,Same. It made me super focused and dedicated for about six hours before I tapered off.
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"I know what you mean- medication is great, but it should always be coupled with strategies to minimize the downsides of ADHD. 

I did most of the leg work after being diagnosed and before getting medicated (2 years.) My therapist gave me a concise list to read based on the areas of impact to my life, and I had access to a ton of audiobooks from audible and Libby. I recommend ‘Delivered from Distraction’ due to its chapters being structured to cater to ADHD readers.  👍 

I’m especially glad I built these habits and structures for myself now that it’s so freaking difficult to get a refill!"
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"Yeah, I also hoped it would work like a pair of glasses, put em on and you’re fine. But it’s more like walking with crutches, you still have to put in all the work yourself, it just gets less exhausting."
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"I do think the right dose of Ritalin should help with second guessing yourself.  For me, Wellbutrin helped with that the best."
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"What?!  Magical thinking doesn't work?  Well I nevva!  I have always lived with magical thinkers, so I get it!  (Mom, Dad, sister, friends, roommates, other relatives.)

When my Mom broke her wrist, she only had the first cast on for a couple of days when she decided her arm was all better and it was time to get the cast off.  (There were 4 casts as the swelling reduced.  A different color each time.)  She knew logically that it wasn't all better, but when she is tired of being sick or injured, she is always ""all better.""  Then it becomes my job to remind her what the doctor said, how the x-rays looked, where it was broken, how much longer it will take, blah, blah, blah, (then a week or so later we do it again).  If she weren't so cute and sweet...

So yeah, not a magic pill.  But without it, I sit and stare, wondering what I was doing--or going to do next.  I have a much harder time remembering the word for a thing, thingy, or thinger; if I can remember the last two.  I usually ask where the thing is, ""You know, the thing with the thing on the side...""  My Mom's imagination is less mentally-visual (she can't picture things) so the ""thing"" which I am obviously showing her with my hands to be, has little to no meaning.

Your adaptation problem is that everyone is different, so your needs will be unique to a point.  No matter how many suggestions or tips you read, you still have to try some to see if they work.

1) If you are sensitive, a piece of yarn tied loosely to your coffee cup and slip-knotted over your wrist will keep you within a few feet of the cup, but there are cons.  

2) If you are rule-oriented, you could decide to only set it on a designated style of coaster, and they come in sets or 4 or 6.

3) I'm more visual, so when I set down my water cup, I try to look down at it and remember what I set it on, and what is around it.  Sometimes I only glance, and the impression is too vague.  Searching is the consequence.  If I'm in a hurry or too tired, I just fill another cup.

My philosophy is that sometimes it's okay to put things off for a little while.  1) If I'm really not thinking well, it's smarter and safer. 2) There may be a subconscious reason I'm not doing it; what is the problem?  Did I forget something that needed doing first?  3) Is it something I need inspiration for?  Such as a project that needs a creative solution because we can't afford a simple one.  

You talk about second-guessing yourself.  What is that about?  Do you make choices, then think ""Oh, no!  Should I have done the other thing?""  If it Is, I came up with a way that nearly always helps me find out what I REALLY want:

I do Eeny-Meeny, and choose the next thing in line, not the one I land on.  It's best to stick to one method.  I this is my secret weapon.

Eeny-Meeny-Miney-Moe, catch a tiger by the toe, if he hollers, let him go, Eeny-Meeny-Miney-Moe.  Then I choose the thing that's next in line.  

If you feel disappointed, that is not the choice you want.  So discard that item and keep eliminating until you land on an Item that you feel happier about.  If you never feel ""happy,"" about one, then you don't really mind, so choose the one that doesn't make you feel disappointed.  Sometimes I start over, and relax, and I get a better read from my subconscious.  

For example, if I can only afford one scarf but I like 3, I will do this in my head, just moving my eyes.  When I'm disappointed, I think ""Oh, I didn't want to land on that one.""  Then if I'm happy with the final result, my choice is made, and it's final; my subconscious has spoken.  Does that make sense?  [I was Santa's helper starting when I was little, so when ""Santa"" asked me to help make choices--which was often--this was what I used.]

The last subject; neurotic.  Are you really?  Or just trying not to make mistakes?  You know that mistakes are okay, right?  The result/consequence of a mistake is not always fun, but a lot of them aren't vital, and are rarely life-and-death.  

I like to make informed choices so I usually find a couple of good resources and learn a LOT about a topic or object, then make a decision.  This is how I buy good quality tools at a  reasonable price, buy stamps in bulk at a discount, and clothes that don't make me feel like I'm suffocating and too hot.  It takes time, writing a few notes, copying links, and finding the best resources, but excellent information is very important to me (or as close to correct as I can get).

I hope some of this is helpful; I know it's long, but well meant!"
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,doesn't sound like the right med or right dose for you.
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"This feels like my experience on Strattera. There’s less ‘bidding’ and negotiation in my brain - things are clearer. But task initiation is still shocking and I definitely forget things. I’be realised I need new strategies with this new brain… like, I need to learn to be the new me - that isn’t driven by a sense of urgency… Which I think is worth it at this stage. 

I also think I can’t multi-task as well with the hyperactivity gone; I work in a restaurant and I used to know where every customer was and what sequence to do - they just paid, clean the table - they just ordered, get them cutlery. _The irony of less chatter in my brain… when it turns out I need some of that chatter to be on top of things haha_

Oh well. See how I go Implementing new strategies to remember these things. 
Because I like the quietness…"
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,This is a wonderfully helpful perspective. I like this thought that meds might just give us a boost to the point where we can implement normal patterns for productivity.
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"I used to be someone who said meds changed my life, and they did, but it downplayed all of the hard work I put in. I wasn’t saying that after taking medication for a month, a year, or even two years. It wasn’t until at least 5 years later that I could see how different my life and emotions were."
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,I wouldn't be surprised if most of people who do experience such a shift were into self-improvement for years and meds were just a missing piece.
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"Totally agree. It’s an unfair fairy tale that I saw everywhere and was then searching for myself. Luckily My psychiatrist was great at managing my expectation, more or less saying: 

“No pill magically solves everything. They all have their pros and cons. You have to decide if the quality of life is *improved and therefore worth it. I take ibuprofen every day to manage my back pain, but I know it undermines my stomach and liver health, but without it I wouldnt be able to function.”

*edit for clarity"
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,I feel like i secretly think that way (meds will fix me) but it's also because I know soooooo many ways to be organized and to work and I have so much ambition that I feel like it's water crashing on a wall and medication will destroy that wall and allow everything to pour out
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"As a 31 year old, who only got diagnosed and medicated 2 months ago, but been lurking in the forums for the past year, I wish I read more posts like this! 
When the medication didn't change my whole life I was kind of saddened and discouraged and made me doubt my diagnosis.
It's helping but I got to put in effort 👌"
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,This
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"You ""disagree""?

Pretty sure that's just some people relaying their experience. There's nothing to disagree with. The only thing worth disagreeing with in this conversation is ""X will result in Y for everyone"". Medication won't work the same for everyone, therapy won't work the same for everyone. That's about it. It's worth not setting high expectations simply because of the fact that you won't know how something will *personally* impact you. 

I think there are a lot of people who experience profound differences on medication. It's not some elaborate conspiracy that a million people have spontaneously decided to lie about their benefits from medication. There's also going to be a lot of people that don't. These can both be true."
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,">""I took meds and now everything is perfect!""

I mean, yeah, that's the TLDR version for me. It took a lot of effort and time on top of that, sure, but I definitely couldn't have done it without meds."
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"Oh this is so my experience! I was describing the benefit to myself as ‘emotional regulation’ but what you’ve said hits the nail - I’m not exhausting myself during the day with mental gymnastics, so I have way more consistent energy and mood, especially at the end of the day."
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,This matches another comment as well. It’s a very helpful perspective. Thanks for sharing
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"Loved reading this. I often feel that a lot of what I do feels excessive… and I question if I’m making things more complex… but then I remember what my brain is:

It struggles having its own internal structures, so of course I have to make external structures to channel it. 

Thanks for posting^ made me feel less alone / crazy haha. Also a GREAT hack for tracking your achievements and managing your boss’ expectations, so neither of you gaslight into think you did nothing."
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,I could’ve written this post. It’s nice to see someones experience so closely matching mine. Validates me- and I need that!
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"I'm sorry you had that experience, it really sucks and is so heartbreaking. I had a similar one with Ritalin (modified release). I felt on top of the world the first week or two! I had motivation and energy, I was excited by things again, I could actually listen to music and do things I enjoyed as well as the things I didn't enjoy. In the first week I finally reorganized the spare room I'd been procrastinating on for over a year. And it felt great! I talked more and wanted to actually see and socialize with people! I'm pretty much a hermit otherwise.

Then I was going up to 54mg and I had a cold at the time (tested 4 times for covid and nothing). And the thing about modified release is it would give me 22% right away and then 78% about 4-5 hours later.

So on the day I went up, I felt fine at first. The extreme of those good effects in the first week had gone down a little...but I was still sleeping better and waking feeling refreshed (did get awful dry mouth and constipation too but those were my only real side effects). Then 4 and a half hours after my first 54mg dose I started to feel so ill. Thumping headache, blood pressure and heart rate were bad, dizzy, confused, breathless when talking and walking. So I had to stop. I took a break from them for a week and then started back up again at the 36mg dose. All the good effects were gone. Only terrible muscle rigidity in my neck and shoulders And headaches. I also felt depressed and irritable. But idk maybe I needed more time to recover?

It was so heartbreaking to have that glimps of something so wonderful for a split second. I cried about it. Deep ugly sobbing kind of crying because I felt like I was always going to find things so fucking difficult while everyone else seems to function like that? On a different level to me? Where they can actually put a thought into action?

I'm currently trying instant release Ritalin for a few weeks. Increasing the dose by 5mg each week. It's a bit of a pain because i have to take it 3 times a day and that means I need to set a timer on my phone, or I'll forget. There doesn't seem to be this lasting effect like with modified release. Though, maybe that's because I'm only on a low dose and it hasn't had chance to change my brain chemicals yet. I'm hoping that's the case cause it doesn't feel like it's doing anything yet 😔

Are you going to try another type of medication? Or have you exhausted all your options?

Also, is it worth giving it some time and trying vyvanse again in the future?"
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"I started on concerta and had that! Started at 18mg and felt a little better but not that much. Upped to 36 and it was like unmedicated. Super tired, the overstimulation and irritability, executive function struggles. I even accidentally doubled up to 72 one day and felt nothing. Switching to XR Adderall now, fingers crossed!"
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,It may be because of the nation wide shortage of Adderall. I find it hard to get my prescription filled.
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,there’s actually papers written on how starting meds early in life helps brain functions later in life for those with adhd.  So it’s possible it helped or maybe it gave you the habits that help so you didn’t notice as much when you came off.  Just throwing that out there 🤷‍♀️
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"Hi, just wanted to thank you for your help with this stuff. I'm going down a rabbit hole on Ritalin/ADHD and saw one of your comments from a year ago providing an article about ADHD at university and it's been an immense help. Checked your profile & you're still active with the advice so I'm just extending my thanks here since I can't private message! 

As for the original post, I'm starting Ritalin on Monday, got diagnosed with ADHD on Thursday so I'm worried I'm going to be feeling the same as OP."

Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"Bro where were you and your sage wisdom years ago when i started my journey lmao, cause it went something like this ->

-I thought I was a fat lazy loser

-Learned I have severe ADHD and forgave myself for how much i hated myself for everything being hard

-Then further on I got medication, and wow it was an eye-opener, I could actually MAKE DECISIONS

-I proceeded to play video games and get addicted to Japanese gameshows for like months, wtf my meds stopped working

-then therapy got thrown in the mix... and some harsh truths came my way. She basically explained how a lot of things were caused by NY disorder....but also, I happened to be a fat, lazy, loser on top of that lmao

-the meds were doing exactly what they're supposed to, they were allowing me to make decisions. I just consistently still picked the wrong ones lol, and I couldn't blame my executive dysfunction anymore, cause I knew exactly what I was doing. On meds I felt guilty for doing it, so I knew the difference. Off meds, days just ""disappeared"" in a blink... but medicated... I made the decision every single level of a video game..to just... keep going... and going... and going...going.... 

-I had to go back to my first diagnosis memories, and ""unforgive"" like 50% of my failure lifestyle. Then started learning how to be a person, my therapist made it really simple for my dumb brain and even taught me how to ise a daily planner and alarms on my phone

-journey to learn adhd management skills AND adding learning how to build willpower in general/overall healthy habits


If I had known that pills weren't just motivation in a bottle, then I woulda maybe give to the gym or eaten a vegetable for once before my first appointment 💀 yeah, I know, adhd likely made me act unhealthier, but... looking back, it wasn't always executive function keeping me lazy or dopamine rich distractions.... sometimes I just sucked and had no motivation lol


(Also if anyone reads this, i should clarify.. Adhd does make you feel like a lazy loser, chances are that's NOT who you are. That's the disorder and you can work and turn life around.  But if you call into the trap of blaming everything on adhd, youre in for a long journey of self discovery....)"
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,Strattera made me decide to go untreated. I could not not focus. I was always focused. There was no relaxing. That and some sexual side effects.
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"Meds make it so that you CAN be functional. Therapy and lifestyle changes make it so you actually ARE functional.  


Put out the fire, THEN rebuild the house. In that order."
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"I wish, but it's not a magic bullet. If only it were that easy."
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"I’m finding this thread extremely helpful. I’ve started meds recently and had no idea what my expectations should be. I asked my psychiatrist and she said she couldn’t tell me what to expect, I just need to tell her my symptoms… but I’ve read about people taking adderall and suddenly feeling like superheroes, where I don’t feel any different. At least not different enough that I can really notice. So it’s great to hear other experiences and help temper my expectations a little bit."

Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"I'm new to this community, and I haven't even been diagnosed yet but I have an appointment shortly, and I've tried no drugs really in my life at all. 

But still, if it helps put things in perspective, maybe that ""top of the world,"" feeling that you had at first, wasn't actually real or healthy. These are drugs that affect the brain, and lots of drugs can give you unrealistic feelings of being in control of your life.

Maybe that brief window of perceived competence isn't actually something worth aspiring to, but a temporary side effect. Just a thought."
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,Sending good luck!! Hope XR works for you
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"Weirdly I had a waaaaay harder time getting concerta. And it was like double the price 😭 but she did mention the shortage, so I agree, I think that’s why she made the switch"
Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"No worries! I’ve had so many helpful bits of advice, tips and tricks from others, so thanks for letting me know my contributions are helping! We’re all in this together right? Congratulations on the diagnosis, self knowledge is so powerful and learning a whole new thing about yourself as an adult can be awesome (in both meanings of the word). If I was going to start meds from scratching again, knowing what I know now, I would treat it as a voyage of discovery. Everyone has a different experience so the meds will be different too, I would recommend just trying to be conscious and explore the possibilities, notice what helps and what doesn’t. For me, I got the quiet that everyone seems to talk about (but isn’t universal) but I learnt that task initiation for me needs a bit more than just making sure I’ve taken my meds. Look up widening the ramp if that’s something you also struggle with, it’s about finding the right entry point to a task for me and learning what I can do to make transitions easier. And I think if we find something that works for us, it’s always worth sharing as we all need a variety of tools in our toolbox as not everything works every time either. Good luck on your meds, hope you’re well suited to the first option!"

Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"Fair enough, nothing I said was mean.

Irrationally disappointed that Ritalin didn’t immediately make me a better person,"I also thought that at the time but I am also on an ssri and another medication (as well as weekly therapy) for severe depression and PTSD...so I think the top of the world feeling was actually genuine happiness and pleasure in doing things that I hadn't felt since I was a child. I can't listen to music or do anything I enjoy anymore because of executive dysfunction and anhedonia. So I had a lot of freedom in those first few weeks when Ritalin was giving me good effects. Then it stopped giving me any good affects and only bad ones. My post might have simplified it but I don't think it's irrational to feel great about being able to function and then upset that I was back to being unable to function.

Are there any PROVEN long-term effects of using Ritalin/Methylphenidate?,"The current state of the science is that when taking stimulant medications as prescribed, there is no risk. None. Literally, they cannot find any long-term moderate or serious effects. One study showed an increase risk of heart disease in people who took methylphenidate, but the risk was higher for people on low doses than those on high doses, and it turns out people with pre-existing heart conditions are more likely to be prescribed methylphenidate than amphetamine, and more likely to be on low doses. So, people with pre-existing heart conditions are at higher risk of heart disease, and also some of them take methylphenidate. 

In children, one study found that kids taking stimulants were 1 inch shorter and 6 pounds lighter than kids who don’t take stimulants, but then they found that was only true for the first two years on medication, after which the kids caught up in height and weight even if they continued to take the medication.

[If you don’t already have a heart condition, all stimulants are demonstrably fine long-term.](https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/articles/2015/04/28/10/06/the-safety-of-stimulant-medication-use-in-cardiovascular-and-arrhythmia-patients) The only long term effects are mildly elevated heart rate and blood pressure, which are not serious and can be mitigated. If you do have a heart condition, they’re still often fine depending on which heart condition and which medication you’re on.

With respect to liver damage, I can’t find any literature on liver damage from ADHD medication so that other commenter is talking out of their ass. 

Stimulants also don’t stick around in the body. If you take them in the morning, they are completely gone from your system by the next morning. There’s no harm in taking medication breaks if that works for you. But there’s also no harm in taking the extremely low doses of safe medication you have been prescribed. The level of anxiety you express in this post is likely to do just as much harm to your body in exactly the same way, because anxiety also increases your heart rate and blood pressure."

Are there any PROVEN long-term effects of using Ritalin/Methylphenidate?,"As far as toxicity goes, as far as I know, methylphenidate is filtered by the kidneys rather than the liver, so there is no risk of liver toxicity. As for the kidneys, methylphenidate and other stimulant style medications may cause your body to burn fat for the sugar stores, which must later be processed by the kidneys. The sugar influx is usually more damaging than the meds. You’ll know if you are taking too much, though, because you’ll start having to pee more and May get sleepy due to the sugar crash. 

If you are taking the right amount, kidney damage is typically not an issue. The only reason you would need to worry is if you have diabetes or pre-existing kidney damage, in which case you’ll want to make sure that you know what dosage you can take safely and not go over that. Ideally, take an extended release variant so your body doesn’t release as much sugar. 

As far as tolerance:
With people who have adhd…you can start to build a tolerance, but ultimately there is a point at which that stops and your body is at equilibrium with the medication. For some people this is a low dose, for others it is much higher. 

There are also different types of adhd, and different medicines work better for each. Unfortunately, there is no known way to find out which type you have, except for trying different meds to see how each med affects you. 

Other negative symptoms you may find:
Stimulant meds typically raise heart rate and blood pressure. If you have chronic pain or arthritis, the increased blood pressure may result in increased inflammation. If that affects you, you may want to try a different medication. 

Positive symptoms:
The increased heart rate means more blood to the brain, so staying awake while reading scientific papers becomes far easier."
Are there any PROVEN long-term effects of using Ritalin/Methylphenidate?,"One of the effects of taking stimulants long term, for someone with ADHD, is that your brain starts to look more like that of a person without ADHD.

Here's what it was useful for me to realize. You are trying to operate WITHOUT the optimal amount of neurotransmitter in your brain. Stimulants push you up to a ""normal"" level of that, not ""above"", which is what neurotypical people are doing when they get high.

Any ""dependency"" is just your brain wanting to work correctly. From a neurobiological point of view, withdrawing a chemical that makes your brain function normally is going to feel bad. You are already ""dependent"" on it, in the sense that without it you return to or operate at a baseline that is not as functional.

Tolerance would certainly be a challenge, so I can see your concern there, as would other health effects."
Are there any PROVEN long-term effects of using Ritalin/Methylphenidate?,"There was one post about someone not being able to take meds because it ruined their liver. that sort of scared me. I just started 2 weeks ago at age 40 and was a little scared because i abused Sodas when I was younger. But I'm pretty healthy now. I feel not treating it can possibly lead to things like dementia. I also have bad sleep problems too, which both my doc and I think are ADHD related. The stim med sadly isn't making it any better, but at least it's not making it worse. I give it credit for at least making me much more alert.

Dopamine released by a workout works very well for many people and many case studies about this are mentioned in the book ADHD 2.0. Many people with ADHD use it to help them focus as well. 

Because you generally can focus without meds, I feel that it’s likely that this option will work for you. 

Also are you able to time the reading in 20 min sections (use pomodoro app), and every 20 min, take a break for 5-10min, eat chocolate/surf FB/play a game, and then when the alarm pings again, try another 20 min? This works well for some cases because it basically releases another hit of dopamine every 20 min.

Are there any PROVEN long-term effects of using Ritalin/Methylphenidate?,"All the wishful thinking people saying that stimulants have no long-term effects are wrong.

The body, including the brain, works based off of homeostasis.  This means that when you increase the level of dopamine in the brain, the brain will respond by increasing the number of dopamine transporters (which remove dopamine).

There are several studies showing effects like this, e.g.

https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0063023

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3770255/

This means that the brain continuously makes you more and more resistant to dopamine the longer you are on stimulants.  So when you go off stimulants, you're brain state will be worse than when you started.

If you stay on stimulants forever, then maybe that's not a problem.  But for many people, methylphenidate tolerance builds and sometimes eventually stops working well (google ""methylphenidate stopped working site:www.reddit.com"" to see how common this is).  Or you may start getting side effects like heart or gastric issues that cause you to cease medication.  At that point, you my suffer significant anhedonia, lethargy, and difficulty focusing due to the increased levels of dopamine transporters.

This is all basic homeostasis.  You can't expect to take stimulants every day without having an effect on your brain."

If you're concerned with heart/liver issues, ask your doctor or psychiatrist about doing annual tests to monitor heart/liver to make sure they're healthy. I do annual blood work and urine sample at my doctor's recommendation (and have been for a little over a decade iirc).

Are there any PROVEN long-term effects of using Ritalin/Methylphenidate?,"A Layman's opinion so **\[Trigger Warning\]**. I'm not a medical professional so take what I say with a grain of salt. Also anyone who disagrees feel free to chime in, I am pretty open minded and would like to hear other opinions as long as they aren't insults. 

Having said that, there are a couple things I take into account with anyone who says that ""there are **no** **risks**"" with any medication. It's common sense to me that there will be always be some kind of physical affect on a molecular and chemical level every time you introduce a foreign entity to your body and it is broken down by your body. Anyone saying that there are no risks, is simply incorrect. *If you believe that bad food can affect your health over the course of weeks/months/years, why would you think that distilled drugs will not? The same drugs that you can overdose and die on, won't affect your biology in the long run?*

Another thing I think worth mentioning is scientific studies are often produced by financial interest groups. Which means that a study will not be done if it doesn't benefit the agenda of the organization funding it. This is why there is very little known about specific illnesses (brain zaps is an example) because no company is making money doing studies on that. *Don't mistake the lack of evidence for a conclusion that things are absolutely safe.* 

The truth is there is a lot of undiscovered science that is left to the ether because no one wants to know the answers to them because it is not helping capitalism. A study that proves that specific drugs cause long term issues will affect long term company profits and so what is the incentive to do these studies. Most of these adverse affects are only reported because it was not the original intention of the study (which was probably more about the positive effects of the drug) and have to be reported legally.

A prime example of an instance where medicine was promoted but actually harmful is the history of the opioid epidemic. Doctors promoted pain killers and opioids for years, pushed by financial incentives of big pharma. This caused the deaths of tens of thousands of individuals (Watch the HBO Documentary: *The Crime of the Century*)**.** It was normal and beneficial to promote opioids until people started dropping like flies. 

I bring up the opioid epidemic **not** to make a direct comparison to stimulants for ADHD, they aren't the same thing. But I bring it up to illustrate that as a consumer you have to be conscious of the forces that are present within the pharmaceutical industry. Trust your gut, and weigh your own risk vs benefits, do not let anyone else do it for you because their interest is not with you.   


I take stimulants myself for my ADHD and I immediately notice side-effects. One for me is elevated heart rate, sometimes sweating, and chest pain. I know it is different for everyone depending on their biology, but again, just because you don't see the day to day effects does not mean that it isn't happening. Every time your heart rate is elevated for example, your heart is beating more cycles than it would originally without the medication. There is wear-and-tear as with anything, and imagine a balloon being inflated and deflated, eventually it will wear out over time as the elasticity fades. That is common sense. Your cells have only a set number of reproductions before telomeres shorten enough to have severe health issues. If cell death and rebirth is accelerated via external factors (such as excessive heart beating) it will certainly shorten life-span. **The ultimate question then is, how much is your life shortened?**   


I don't know the answer to that, my guess is it is caused by a number of factors including how often you take the drugs, other stressors to your body, your inherent DNA and other unique personalized health risks.   


As to how these stimulant health-risk studies are done, I would love to know more because I do not know how someone could ascertain an accurate gauge of how much potential years you'd shave off your life when the controls aren't even the same. Since every person's biology is different it is almost unpredictable and hard to know how much life you are actually shaving off since it will vary depending on unique biology. If there were twin studies, now that would make more sense and I'd love to see that if that was available.   


In conclusion, dispense with the idea that there are zero negative effects to any medication. There is always side-effects, and long term effects even if you are currently asymptomatic. It's the same idea with individuals who develop cancer. You're asymptomatic for 20 years, until one day you have cancer. The thing is there were probably thousands of decisions and controllable factors that could have created more risk of cancer/accelerated it in those 20 years, including factors such as sleep, diet, stressors, and environment. The unfortunate thing is that it is impossible to measure those factors accurately. The same thing can be said about any medication. There is no way to prove for example if your hypothetical early death 20 years from now is directly linked to taking your stimulant medication. There are also forces out there that will skew the data and define it differently as to avoid lawsuits or profit loss.   


So the best thing to do is, trust your gut. Assess your own risks/benefits. See how much you can get away with not taking medication. I understand with people with ADHD you are often completely dysfunctional without it, trust me I experience that myself. However, there are probably more balanced and efficient ways to handle your unique situation. Perhaps spacing out the medication, micro-dosing, or looking for other stimulant alternatives. I would just explore every other option first before assuming that taking the medication will not affect you in the long run. Hope this was a helpful insight to anyone reading this."

Are there any PROVEN long-term effects of using Ritalin/Methylphenidate?,Ritalin has got a methyl ester which is super easily metabolized by CES1 (carboxylesterase 1) in the liver and there is plenty of that stuff there. It’s responsible for ca. 80% of hydrolytic activity of the liver. This enzyme is super promiscuous and works just to do this kind of thing all day long. This is also why Ritalin is so variable for people as there is a lot of interindividual variability of CES1 expression in liver and some people just have a lot of it and metabolize it real quick and the metabolite is completely inactive. So yeah… we probably eat a lot of nasty stuff everyday that is way worse for our livers than just some molecule with a labile ester waiting to be cleaved off 😅

Are there any PROVEN long-term effects of using Ritalin/Methylphenidate?,Do you mean in terms of tolerance in the short term?
Are there any PROVEN long-term effects of using Ritalin/Methylphenidate?,">	Even when I take it the following days, I feel that they do work less.

That’s in your head. It would take much longer than that to actually develop a tolerance. 

Now, it’s worth noting that when you first start taking ADD meds they can have a very mild mood elevating effect, much like coffee. You might notice it “kick in.” 

After a while, much like coffee, you will stop noticing that as much and it will just feel normal. You might not notice the difference in the same way you did the first couple days but the effectiveness has not changed. 

Anecdotally, I have also noticed that short acting meds like methylphenidate have a much more noticeable rise and fall as you metabolize them. Long release meds, like concerta and vyvanse, tend to rise a bit more gradually but then will plateau for hours and then have a more gentle fade as they start to wear off. It’s much less jarring, and more consistent, so that tends to be the preferred option for people who need the effects to last all day (or at least through the work day). 

Anyway, you might be noticing a bit of that. If so, don’t worry about it. You’re still getting the benefit of the meds. 

Or, and this strikes me as more likely, you’re just anxious about taking the meds and your imagination is running wild a bit. You’re worried about developing a tolerance so you are hyper vigilant looking for signs. 

Keep in mind that a lot of people when they start these meds don’t notice a difference *at all* until someone else notices and points it out to them. That’s extremely common. 

They aren’t *intended* to make you “feel” different. They just help you function better. So just because you aren’t noticing them work doesn’t mean they aren’t. 

You’ll be fine. If you have shit to do and feel like your meds will help, go ahead and take them. That’s what they’re for. As long as you don’t exceed the prescribed dosage/intervals you’re totally fine. There’s also nothing wrong with skipping a day if you’ve got nothing going on. A lot of people, for example, skip their meds on the weekend. A lot of people don’t, because that’s when they do their house chores or work on hobbies. That’s also perfectly fine. Don’t overthink it.

And if you find they work a bit less over time that’s also not a big deal. Talk to your doctor about it, and he can adjust your dosage. That’s extremely common, and not a sign that anything is wrong. They’re never as effective as when you first start taking them, but they continue to be a huge benefit. Most people have to up their dosage at some point, but then find a dose that works best for them and tend to be pretty stable after that. 

Again, don’t worry about it if that happens. You’re on a very low dose right now so unless you have very  mild symptoms or you are a very small person I would be surprised if that continues to be enough forever. 

TL;DR
That’s too soon to be developing a tolderance, and if you do develop a bit of a tolerance that’s normal and not a problem."
Are there any PROVEN long-term effects of using Ritalin/Methylphenidate?,"Hi, chiming in here. I was diagnosed at 6, I’ve been on stimulant medication since I was 9 and I have a methylphenidate system, like you. I am 24 now and can honestly say that I have never had big issues with tolerance. When I was a kid we did have to titrate up occasionally, but currently I’ve been on the same dose of my same stimulant for over three years, and there are no signs of needing a change. 

As for “dependency,” I don’t think that word applies in this context, at least in the context where there’s a negative stigma attached to it. Stimulants help our brains make enough of the neurotransmitters we’re missing so we can be functional. To put this in perspective, who would ever accuse a diabetic of being “dependent” on their insulin? Their bodies don’t produce enough of it/are resistant to it, so they add what they need to be functional. 

There’s a stigma around ADHD medication (and psychotropic drugs in general) that is very harmful and pretty much entirely untrue when it’s used in the correct context. It is extremely safe, people taking it are not “addicts,” and these misconceptions really hurt people like me who have severe ADHD and rely on stimulants. Stimulants are my insulin- if I don’t take them, I’m not a functional human being. I’d encourage you to examine why you hold these ideas, where they came from, and if they actually hold merit."
Are there any PROVEN long-term effects of using Ritalin/Methylphenidate?,"The first days when I started Ritalin, I just experience it a bit intenser. When I use it a few days in a row, I don’t notice the effects as much. But the meds still work. I get things done easier, tasks take less time and I can prioritise. So I might not ‘feel’ the difference anymore but it certainly still works. 

I kinda are ‘depended’ on it, but more because I’m so happy that I function as a semi normal human being. At the same time: our brain isn’t doing it themselves. So we use medication to help our brain."
Are there any PROVEN long-term effects of using Ritalin/Methylphenidate?,"You're sort of experiencing more contrast if you only taking the meds every now and then. Usually you settle after two weeks or so of taking it every day and then hit a constant level,  5mg is ridiculously low though so expect to probably land at 10-15. You're not going to shoot up further after the first few weeks.  

It's also not addicting if you have ADHD. Look through the sub how many of us actually keep forgetting to take their meds. I've been on vyvanse and play my daily dose by ear because I fluctuate a lot and can go from 0 to max dose allowed and everything in between with no or few issues."
Are there any PROVEN long-term effects of using Ritalin/Methylphenidate?,"Re: tolerance, most people do find they develop a tolerance but it takes quite a long time and can be reset by switching medications for a relatively short time. I personally have not noticed any reduction in efficacy after a year on generic Adderall and have taken the max dose from the get-go. 

Re: dependency, when taken as prescribed methylphenidate is low risk for dependency. This is partly because it’s such a short-acting medication, and partly because people who take medication for their ADHD substantially lower their addiction risk across the board (because untreated ADHD is itself an enormous addiction risk).

Prescription doses of methylphenidate and amphetamine salts are very similar to caffeine in terms of risks and effects. Yes, they do stuff to your brain. Also, it’s all very short term stuff! People get addicted to caffeine, but if they quit for just two weeks their brains return to their normal, uncaffeinated state. The perception that prescription stimulants are more “hardcore” than coffee comes from drug abuse and crystal meth, which is just not comparable to therapeutic doses of appropriate medication. It’s comparing apples to mega sour apple bombs."

Are there any PROVEN long-term effects of using Ritalin/Methylphenidate?,"I've been taking stimulants (Adderall for most of the time, but I am taking methylphenidate right now) for 20 years.

The only real issue I have ever had with ""dependence"" is that it's awfully nice to be able to function fairly well, and it's upsetting to not be able to. It's not dependence on a substance, it's depending on what it lets me achieve.

If you are worried about it, you can try just a nonstimulant medication if your doctor will prescribe one. But stimulant and nonstimulant medications tend to work even better together than separately.

**Edit** I am reminded that I should say that for most people, the stimulant is the one doing most of the work. There are definitely aspects of *my* nonstimulant, Intuniv, which *for me*, no stimulant can match. As I mentioned above, though, I had a TBI, and my nonstimulant also helps with that."
Are there any PROVEN long-term effects of using Ritalin/Methylphenidate?,">	but rather the quality of life affecting changes, such as long-term tolerance/dependency.

Well, tolerance usually isn’t a big deal. A certain amount of tolerance is normal. At some point you may need to bump your dose, which is fine as long as you aren’t already at the limit and continue to find any side effects tolerable. 

Alternatively, you can take a break from your meds for a while, or at intervals, to reduce your tolerance and maintain efficacy. This is usually referred to as a “med vacation.” 

But expect them to help somewhat less over the years. Not just because of tolerance but because we get used to having them. That’s normal. You’re still going to struggle sometimes. The trick, in my opinion, is to use the good days to establish habits, organization methods, and coping mechanisms that will reduce the burden on the bad days. The meds don’t do the work for you, they just make it possible to get the benefits from the work you were already putting in. 

As for “dependency.” Well, if you mean that in the medical sense, many people do suffer minor withdrawal symptoms when they miss their medication, especially if they take a heavy dose. Others do not. But we’re talking about caffeine level withdrawal, not heroin. You aren’t about to go knock over a liquor store so that you can get your fix. You’ll probably just be a bit “fuzz brained” as I like to describe it. Again, I would compare it to quitting caffeine cold Turkey. Unpleasant but not debilitating. And you might get the munchies. Or not. My sister takes the same meds and doesn’t get any withdrawal if she skips a day. 

After that withdrawal wears off, which can take anywhere from no time at all to a week or two, your brain chemistry completely reverts to normal. Doesn’t matter whether you’ve been taking it for six months or 60 years. There are no permanent changes in brain chemistry like there can be with, for example, cocaine, methamphetamine, or alcohol. Even children develop just fine (although that’s somewhat difficult to prove clinically. Either way the evidence is overwhelmingly that that any hypothetical effects of the meds are probably far less destructive than the results of growing up without them tend to be). 

So it’s not going to make you a junkie or burn your brain out. 

Now, if you mean “dependency” in the sense that you feel like you shouldn’t need a crutch… Well, there’s no shame in needing a crutch if you have a bad leg. Adult ADD is a persistent condition. It’s not something you can fix, or will get better on its own. There’s something physiologically different in your brain, and having a medical intervention helps improve your functioning and quality of life. That’s no different from someone who needs to walk with a cane, or a diabetic who takes insulin. No one loves having to take medication but it’s a lot better than the alternative. 

So yeah, you might need to take it the rest of your life. That’s fine. Most of us do. And if one day you don’t

If you’ve been walking with a limp your whole life and someone offers you a cane, and the cane dramatically improves your life, then don’t worry about whether you’re “dependent” on the cane. Could you go back to limping? Sure, but why would you when you walk so much better with the cane? 

There’s a stigma attached to mental health issues that doesn’t exist for physical health issues. And there’s a stigma attached to taking a controlled substance. Don’t buy into that nonsense. There’s no shame in needing help if it improves your life and the lives of the other people in your life. 

Does that answer your question?"

The issue is that it could be that 1. Adhd likely plays a role in the genes associated with Parkinson’s 2. Severity of adhd is a factor in why ppl take medication so it might be that those with more severe adhd r getting Parkinson’s and it has nothing to do with medications 3. More severe adhd and adhd in general has shown increased rates of poor health (due to lifestyle environment and income to name a few factors) and injuries (specifically car accidents) and one risk factor for Parkinson’s is repeated head trauma. Idk whether ppl with adhd r more likely to be exposed to toxins that can cause Parkinson’s but certain jobs could expose u to these toxins so if those with adhd r more likely to choose those jobs then that’s got nothing to do with stimulants. So really everything is inconclusive."
Are there any PROVEN long-term effects of using Ritalin/Methylphenidate?,To be fair we use chemotherapy and radiation for cancer and they 100% work but they also increase the risk for developing other kinds of cancer. So ritalin could potentially help treat Parkinson’s while also being a risk factor (which is irrelevant for those with Parkinson’s but is relevant for anyone who doesn’t).

These effects are pretty negligible unless you have an underlying heart condition, in which case you shouldn’t have been prescribed ADD meds in the first place. 

For perspective, the same can be said for caffeine use, and no one bats an eye at two cups of coffee a day. 

It’s not a significant long term factor.

I’m not sure what you mean by that. I’ve never done weed, but you shouldn’t feel intoxicated. 

Some people can have an adverse reaction and actually experience drowsiness while taking ADD meds. That’s unusual, but a known side effect. 

Either way it’s probably something to discuss with your doctor.

How so? Most people do things the same way on their meds as off, it just all works better with the meds. 

>	Lack of hyper vigilance is fine when sitting in the office but while driving it’s nice to have.


It should actually be easier to drive. The meds help you be able to divide your attention between various tasks, which is important fir driving, while tuning out irrelevant distractions. You may also find yourself speeding less. 

If you’re having trouble driving I would definitely be a bit concerned. Maybe talk to your doctor on that one.

I also feel slightly detached from my emotions but that might also be because I used to obsessively over think and feel those emotions and now I don’t.

Are there any PROVEN long-term effects of using Ritalin/Methylphenidate?,"I hear that, and believe me I’ve thought of that, but I use the insulin analogy because of what I outlined in my comment- both medications give the body something it doesn’t produce enough of on its own.

(Despite appearances, I’m aware of this. I’ve taken endocrinology for my medical training and I know what happens to diabetics who don’t get their insulin) The glasses analogy is better for someone who is medication friendly and needs a bit of encouragement. 

As an aside, I personally think that the best analogy for ADHD meds to my specific case is my wheelchair. I may be able to walk because I’m not paralyzed, but my legs freaking suck and if I try and use them to go about my business 99% of the time, I’ll get horrible cramps that’ll ensure that I can’t even climb the stairs to get back to my apartment. ADHD meds are much more like my wheelchair than glasses, because if I don’t have them, I’m not just going around blurry, I’m doing the equivalent of dragging my body in horrible pain trying to function but practically unable.

Are there any PROVEN long-term effects of using Ritalin/Methylphenidate?,"Just FYI, non stimulants have their pros and cons.

They usually work 24 hours, unlike stimulants which wear off during the day. They take time to build up in your system, but then they keep working all the time. The delivery mechanism is similar to how antidepressants work. 

But they usually don’t have anywhere close to the same level of results that you get with stimulants. Stimulants make a huge and immediate difference. Non-stimulants tend to be subtle, and with more variation from person to person. Some people respond a lot better to them than others, and the same is true for the potential side effects.

So non-stimulants are much better than nothing, and can be very effective when combined with stimulants, but unless you for some reason *can’t* take stimulants, I wouldn’t recommend using non-stimulants instead. 

Some doctors like to start out with non stimulants first because they are not a controlled substance, so the red tape is easier and there’s basically no potential for abuse. They’re also more likely to be covered by insurance than the name brand stimulants. But I think this has more to do with stigma around controlled substances and lack of ADD specific education. I haven’t seen any literature that actually suggests that’s most effective.

So in my opinion (as an official “some asshole on the internet”) stimulants should be the plan A, with non-stimulants being a backup plan or a supplement. (Combined with other non-medical treatments/management strategies of course, in either case.)"
Are there any PROVEN long-term effects of using Ritalin/Methylphenidate?,"Sure thing.

It's originally a blood pressure medication, so be aware of that. You might want to get your heart checked every once and a while. 

It really makes me tired after I take it, and helps me sleep. I've had sleeping issues since my TBI, so that is good. I've needed to schedule my sleep for years, so it doesn't bother me.

Coming off it takes a while. Missing a dose is apparently very rough, because it causes your blood pressure and heart rate to spike.

Now that I have the bad stuff out of the way - this medication changed everything for me.

It helped me sleep. It *calms* me. It makes things *so* much easier to deal with. It gives me no energy to speak of, but it smooths out my path and saves me a whole lot of energy and effort. 

It also helps with my TBI, so some of the edge that it takes off is from there. But ADHD and frontal lobe TBI has a lot of overlap, so I suspect a lot of my difficulty came from the TBI and my ADHD aligning to mess me up. 

This med is one of the reasons I can do well now. Admittedly, I got a PhD without it. But as a student, you're allowed to be erratic. This med has allowed me to be disciplined enough to schedule myself, and that schedule has allowed me to be relatively consistent in my life and my work."

Yeah, there’s a lot of that, and it’s hard not to internalize.

Keep in mind that the average person in the US drinks 3.1 cups of coffee a day. Taking stimulants every day is *normal.* And relative to the benefits it provides, coffee actually has much more in the way of side effects than amphetamines. If you took enough caffeine to replicate the benefits of Ritalin you’d probably give yourself a heart attack and you’d definitely shit your pants.

With medication, uh, things aren’t super amazing for me at this precise moment. However, I can self-regulate better and consider it significant that I can find a baseline level of contentment after getting disregulted.

Are there any PROVEN long-term effects of using Ritalin/Methylphenidate?,"The part about withdrawal, you mean? 

Yeah, pretty much. I take a pretty high dose of vyvanse, which is an extended release drug. I generally take it every day unless something goes wrong. 

If I skip my meds for a day it’s kinda like if you went from 10 cups of coffee a day to zero. I often get a mild headache, sometimes I’m a bit irritable, and my ADD symptoms are much worse than normal. It’s unpleasant, and I usually try to keep my work load as low as I can. I also get a serious case of the munchies, so I usually just say fuck it and make that a “cheat day” as far as snacking goes. But it’s not the end of the world. Coffee or energy drinks help to take the edge off. 

I think of it sort of like if I had a 24 hour cold. I’m not at my best, but I can still do adult stuff if I need to. 

In my case this usually lasts a few days to a week, then I get used to it and I’m back to my non-medicated baseline. Which is of course not as high functioning as my medicated baseline, but it’s better than during withdrawal. 

But this is why I don’t personally take “med vacations” typically. 

Again though, I want to emphasize that not everyone experiences that. I have several relatives who take pretty much the same meds (some at different doses, some the same) and they don’t have any negative effects if they skip a dose. They just don’t get the benefits, but feel fine. 

I have also taken different doses and different medications and noticed differing levels of withdrawal if I miss a dose. Usually still some, but it varies. My current dose is on the strong side of normal. 

From talking with others, and my doctor, my experience is somewhat in the minority but not at all unusual. So YMMV.

>	on day 2 and am having some bruxism today where I didn’t yesterday. I’d say this is probably the most noticeable and annoying side effect.

Or you may just be noticing it today. I grind my teeth a bit too, on or off my meds. In fact I was doing it just now and didn’t notice until you brought up the subject. 

I mean it could be new, but you’re watching for that sort of thing now, and that can skew your perception. It’s important to keep that in mind with any new meds. 

>	4 given the short term memory thing I am having to right stuff down (at work). I deal with multiple clients at a time with multiple different issues and I find I can’t mentally track each of them like I used to.

How so? Because short term memory is usually one of the things that dramatically improves when taking meds. Usually I *have* to write shit down immediately or I forget it right away. With my meds… less so. My short term memory still isn’t ideal, but it’s better. You should have an easier time juggling, not harder. 

>	Physically and mentally everything’s fine I’m just not as aware of literally everything around me if that makes sense. Where before my mind was like a multi lane freeway filled with speeding cars it’s now a one lane highway with one car just cruising along.

Well, that might just mean that you’re tuning out distractions better. You aren’t supposed to focus on everything, all at once. That’s part of what makes ADD a problem. So if you’re tuning out irrelevant data, that’s probably a good thing. 

But if what you mean is that you’re missing important things, especially while driving, then that’s the opposite of what you want. 

I find when I’m driving with my meds that I’m calmer. I can more easily keep track of things in the background, and so driving takes less conscious effort. I also don’t feel like I need to drive fast to keep myself from getting bored and zoning out. I’m still just as aware of everything around me, more aware even, I just don’t *need* to be hyper vigilant in order to do it. I also make a lot fewer driving mistakes, and react faster, even though I subjectively feel like things are moving slower. 

Does that make sense?

Are there any PROVEN long-term effects of using Ritalin/Methylphenidate?,"Floaty feelings etc: can be the calm in your head, or actually some serotonergic effect of the amphetamines (yes, amphetamines also can release serotonin, though usually less than dopamine). Meaning: you can be accompanied by some happy loving feeling. Though probably it’s more likely to be the head calm and distance from emotions that makes you feel floaty. How do you see it? Ultimately it’s your experience so I can only make suggestions. 

Regarding the distance from emotions: the amphetamine will activate parts of your brain more than others. In particular the „grand manager“ in the prefrontal cortex will be more active (compared to baseline) than the deeper and emotional parts like basal ganglia (I hope I don’t confuse names here, so read with caution). This is usually the explanation for feeling more in the head (though a calmer version) compared to feeling in some emotionally entangled plate of spaghetti del chaos. Again, there is no right and wrong here. Maybe you like it. Maybe not. Maybe you get used to it, maybe not, or maybe you don’t even want to get used to it. It’s your experience, you’re life, so do what feels right for you (and good thing, it’s not an irreversible decision)

Then you talk about relearning: that is in fact normal. And it’s good you realize it. Maybe not everybody has it (yet) but that’s the idea of stimulant medication and why it usually should (according to all serious publications about the issue) be accompanied by behavioral therapy. If you grow up with only one leg and then comes somebody and hands you a second leg, obviously you have to learn walking before you can run a marathon. Same here. Why don’t everybody have this then? Because there are plenty other reasons in our environment (say Reddit or other social media for example, but also bad work situations) that trigger adhd symptoms in everybody. Just only temporal compared to true adhd. So depending on your environment and what you already have learned about dealing with these things you still have to deal with those things and so rely on coping mechanisms. 

The. Finally… what was my finally 🤔… ah yeah: the trouble driving thing. I would say that’s again the relearning thing. You experience the world slightly different on meds. So you have to relearn things like driving when having this rather than that type of focus. Nothing impossible. Actually you will likely do so along the way automatically. But something that is there.

Are there any PROVEN long-term effects of using Ritalin/Methylphenidate?,"Well, staying away from alcohol isn’t a bad thing. There isn’t a good amount of alcohol, just a “less bad” amount. So more power to you if you don’t drink. 

Also nothing wrong with avoiding caffeine, but it’s perfectly fine for most people, unless you consume extreme quantities. Most people would experience unpleasant side effects and stop long before they would get to a dangerous dose of caffeine, so that’s not something you really need to worry about. 

Nothing wrong with being conservative, just be aware that you’re more conservative than there is any medical reason to be. 

If the meds are helpful, go ahead and take them up to the prescribed dose and frequency. If you need them less you can always take them less. But don’t worry about it either way."

Vyvanse is a relatively new drug, although I’ve been taking it for like 15 years so it’s far from new. 

More importantly, the actual chemicals it contains aren’t new at all. It’s just a new delivery system. 

Almost all ADD meds contain one or both of two different drugs. I forget what they’re called, but there just two similar types of amphetamines. 

The latest generation of them are different only in that they tend to combine the two, and use various methods to time the release of them. That way instead of having to take a pill every 2 hours all day you can just take a single pill and it releases a constant trickle throughout the day. 

Getting the timing right is quite complex, because you have to factor in different absorption rates as the pill goes through your digestion, but the actual chemicals are the same they’ve been using for ages. 

So nothing to worry about. It’s all just the same shit in a different package. The long term affects are the same as with any other ADD drug."

Are there any PROVEN long-term effects of using Ritalin/Methylphenidate?,This has given me a lot to think about and consider. I feel quite a bit better about many things now. After the past year the distance from emotion is really nice but permanently I don’t know.
Are there any PROVEN long-term effects of using Ritalin/Methylphenidate?,I will say unlike many here I get a far more calming effect than any real motivation to do anything from meds
Are there any PROVEN long-term effects of using Ritalin/Methylphenidate?,"This was the conversation I had with my pharmacist

So I’ve used stimulants in the past (party drugs) and I know they’re bad for your heart. So I asked the pharmacist about the long term effects of using adderall. This was the conversation.

“Well I wouldn’t want to take it. It’s has meth in it and as you know meth has an association with live fast and die young. I messed around a bit with it in college but I don’t know. Maybe that’s something you should do research on?”"

Are there any PROVEN long-term effects of using Ritalin/Methylphenidate?,">	3.	I think I’m the type who hyper focuses on everything

To hyper focus on everything is to hyper focus on nothing. That’s the whole problem with ADD. 

Truth is, the name “Attention Defecit Disorder” is actually a bit of a misnomer. We don’t actually have a lack of attention. What we have is an inability to *consciously direct* our attention. 

So instead of focusing on what’s important, we focus on *everything.* And when there’s not enough going on, we try to seek out new forms of stimulation, internally or externally. We actually have too much attention, and can’t control it to do what we want. 

Hyperfocusing is when you are occasionally able to focus exclusively on something, usually something you happen to find interesting, and then suddenly *ALL* your attention is on it. You’ll work through lunch, you’ll forget to pee, you’ll feel like if you stop for even an instant then all will be lost and you’ll never get your focus back (and often that is in fact the case). If someone tries to talk to you, you might not even notice. That’s hyperfocusing. 

In our hypefocused state we can, in fact, be incredibly productive. We just can’t always hyperfocus on command, or on the things we *should* be focusing on. I once spent a solid 6 hours researching a boat I had absolutely no intention of buying. 

Now, a certain amount of hyperfocusing is normal for ADD, but if you find yourself hyperfocusing too much, or on the wrong things all the time, and being unable to tear yourself away, then it *can* be a sign that you’re over medicated and may need to dial it back. But again, I have no idea whether that applies to your situation so talk to your doctor."
Are there any PROVEN long-term effects of using Ritalin/Methylphenidate?,"Can I ask if you still get that floating feeling? That you described as “like a mild effect of weed”? I have just started Ritalin 10mg, and this is exactly how I would describe the feeling I get."
Are there any PROVEN long-term effects of using Ritalin/Methylphenidate?,Glad it was helpful.

"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?","a slow release stimulant may be best for you, I have slow release concerta and I feel the effects pretty much all day, halfway through it slows down a bit but comes back"
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?","Your Dr is probably starting with a low dose, looking for side effects.  
And planning to increase over time.  I started on 5mg, 3 times a day, IIRC.  
Currently on extended release 36mg (Concerta). Much easier to only take once a day.  
Talk to your Dr, about your experience, and ask what is available."
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?","Vyvanse doesn't drain me, especially if I set myself up for success early in the day. I don't remember Adderall IR or XR draining me, but I got irrationally angry when it wore off in the late afternoon. That's why I switched to Vyvanse."
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?",Famous rebound effect of MPH. Talk to your doctor about it and he might give you another dose for the afternoon.
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?",I specifically am on vyvanse for the slow come down and long lasting effects. I have friends on adderall and ritalin who have massive midday crashes and have to redose.
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?","I’m on adderall and I can feel when it’s wearing off. 🤣 I don’t get tired, or sleep, but I get kind of fatigued and lose focus."
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?","I was first started on Ritalin as well but the crashes were so severe + like you, it was wearing off too quickly - I was switched to extended release (concerta) and it’s more suitable for me, less severe crashes. Been on it for years now. Though if I’m not mindful/careful, (too much caffeine, bad sleep, hungover/dehydrated or just fatigued from drinking the night before) I can still have bad crashes."
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?","Started Adderall a couple weeks ago.  I have noticed nothing, it doesn't seem to affect me at all besides a few hours on the first day I took it."
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?","The concept behind the limited amount of willpower idea is called ego depletion, and it's largely contested nowadays as the original findings studies have not been replicated, and further studies have pushed back on the concept.

Increasing the dose isn't going to increase the duration of the medicine effectiveness, which is what you're looking for.  Extended release or multiple doses make sense for you.  It does make sense that you would feel how you've described here, given you can do more with medication, and once it wears off you're back to normal, which is much different than how you just were for the medications effective duration.  So it's more pronounced of a feeling because it's following a period of you being more functional.

Ultimately it's been a week, and I don't think anyone knows much about their situations for several months or longer, so if you wanted to extend the duration of your medication, I'm on board with that, but I wouldn't increase the dose."
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?",Yes. The brick wall hits hard and is much more determined than I am.
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?","I my doctor gives me instant release tablets, i have to take them three times a day bc they work for about 4 hours. With extended release I take one in the morning (27mg at the moment)  and then 5mg ir by the end of the afternoon"
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?",What worked for me is adderall XR in the morning and regular adderall in the afternoon
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?","adderall, and yes.  extended release is better for making it through the day without having to remember to take a second pill, but I always crash at some point."
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?","Instant Release meds tend to do that more than Extended Release ones. I still felt a little bit of a ""crash' with Extended Release more so at the beginning of taking but now (after months) I don't feel it anymore. I do take a small dose of instant release in the afternoon to help me finish the work day."
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?","Yes,,, it does,,, it's like this thing that hits as soon as I sit on my bed in the end of the day. And for some reason I like it,,, cuz my body works like clockwork,,, I go to bed by 12:00 at the latest and an up 7-ish,,,fixed my sleep schedule somehow"
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?","I definitely feel something. But I think it’s a whole host of things. It’s me losing focus on things, exhausted from masking the autism all day and being overstimulated all day. So I usually come home and crash. Today is the first day of summer break and a new increase of my afternoon dose. It will be interesting to see how it goes."
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?",Bro when I took Ritalin too low of a dosage I was so sleepy! I think it’s cause I was finally able to calm down and relax so I was just tired/body tired cause I workout a bunch. I moved up to 30mg ER (15 mg IR) and I’m doing much better
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?","I've been taking Ritalin for much of my life, the only major side effect from the Ritalin itself for me is loss of appetite + hunger (nightmare combo). You can talk with your doctor about getting a prescription that's meant to last longer or discuss other side effects with them."
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?",I started the same dose two weeks ago. Says long acting but it lasts 4-5 hours. Last week she increased to 20mg LA. I now take one 10mg around 8am and another around 2pm. That seems to work well so far. I’m hoping I don’t have to have another increase but we’ll see.
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?","I usually do a coffee nap.

I take my first dose at 8am-9am, and my second dose around 12-1pm is 25 mg per dose. Usually around the time I'm home from work around 4:30-5 I'm exhausted and I have my partner brew me a small cup of coffee while I'm walking home from work. Once I'm home I bring my coffee into the bed and drink it, take an hour long nap and I wake up more refreshed than ever

Working out helps a lot for me but I'm not going to be able to start that until winter due to surgery"
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?","I agree with those who are suggesting an extended release medication. 

I had the same issue when I was on Ritalin, but I've been on a rotation of Vyvanse/Concerta depending on availability, and they're both extended release. 

I find Concerta lasts longer, but the effects are a little harsh at times (more dizziness, racing thoughts on occasion, more crash at the end of the day) whereas Vyvanse lasts a little less, but you don't realize the meds are wearing off and gently relax at the end of the day, and when the meds are working through the day, I feel I have more mental sharpness as opposed to the racing thoughts I get from Concerta sometimes."
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?","I take immediate release methylphenidate (generic for ritalin), and yes I have noticed this. I started taking it in the morning and eventually added in taking it in the afternoon as well so now I take 10mg around 9AM and 10mg around 1PM which works for me. Maybe ask your psych about adding an afternoon dose if you’re having trouble in the afternoon.

It helps for me to plan my productive hours around my meds and plan rest in the evening. 

Also pay attention to how your medicine feels with the foods you eat/things you drink. My meds are most effective when I eat breakfast before taking my meds. I eat meals with a good amount of protein and complex carbs (e.g. over easy eggs, chicken sausage, fruit, toast). I avoid simple carbs (e.g. a donut) for breakfast because my med crash is worse, and my meds don’t last as long.

I’ve also seen people say here that vitamin C and coffee can negatively impact meds so I try not to consume those at the same time as I take my meds in the morning. I can’t confirm if there’s legitimacy to that though."
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?","Nothing. Mostly play WoW all day, then whatever I feel like the rest. I read a LOT."
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?",I take Azstarys and it is half instant release and half slow release. It helps me with motivation a lot.
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?","I take Vyvanse which is effective for 12-14 hours. I do get more tired at night after it wears off but that’s actually good for me because my natural inclination is to stay up all night and sleep all day and I don’t want to do that. I used to be VERY alert, keyed up and awake late at night. It was actually the only time I used to be productive. But that obviously had negative impacts on my life. 

Unfortunately I still stay up too late because once my meds wear off I have no motivation or self control anymore so I just sit on the couch putting off going to bed and telling myself “Just one more episode.” 

Nothing really to be done about it med wise though since stimulants really should be out of your system before bed so that you can sleep properly. I just need to get my ass from the couch to bed."
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?","I switched to extended release for this reason and the crash now is only a tiny one and it comes later in the day. Usually around the time dinner is done and we're all in the couch with the tv on, so I don't care. 


Lately I have had a few days where I crashed early and hard again. Turns out that happens when I drink a Fanta for lunch. Switched back to water and hasn't happened since. "
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?","I take vyvanse 40mg with a generic adderall 10mg booster. I find with just my vyvanse, it starts to where off right around 1pm (I take it at 7:30). And I crash. Vyvanse is technically supposed to wear of gradually and be smoother, but I found that's not the case for me. I take my adderall in the early afternoon and avoid the vyvanse crash, and I find that I am feeling pretty good throughout the rest of the evening.

I originally was on vyvanse 30mg by itself but it was only lasting a few hours, so next appointment i asked to up to 40 and add a booster to take as needed."
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?","I take concerta that lasts all day, but when evening rolls around, I feel completely drained. The stimulants help for sure, but when they wear off, my body comes down from super concentration mode and is exhausted from the energy it took me to stay there during the day."
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?",Yes. Even slow release with a booster went thru my system in like 5 hours. My dr ended up adding in a nonstim with my stim. Made a big difference. Good luck
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?","I started vyvance 30mg for the first time this passed week for 7 days as a trial period. It's shockingly effective for 3-4 hours maybe an hour and a half after I take it, but then the effectiveness seems to go away pretty quickly after noon. I do notice myself being a bit sleepier in the evening time as well."
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?",Vyvanse doesn’t for me. 
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?","Yes, I was on Ritalin from age 13 to 18. I think it was the only meds around at the time, and I alternated between zombie from focus to zombie from exhaustion. I took Adderall from 18 to 24 ish, and it wasn't much better, but it was better. I've been unmedicated since then, but I am going to be going back on, I am excited for non stimulant options in my mid 40s..."
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?","yes , i take 10mg XR 4 times a day for this reason"
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?",I found the longer I took the medication the less I felt drained at the end of the day. Now I don't really have that feeling.
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?","Yes, it’s the infamous crash. It’s worse with instant release meds, but you can get a milder form of it with extended release. Around 6pm when my meds wear off I’m ready to go to bed."
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?","I don't tend to get it on my amfexa (IR), but my elvanse (XR) has me feeling like i ran a marathon at the end"
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?","Yes, sometimes if I get the timing wrong. Not drunk enough. I’ll suddenly feel overwhelmingly tired. I take Amfexa as a top up."
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?",sorry i meant extended release lol
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?",I’m taking Concerta which is an extended release med iirc. But there is a bit of a crash at the end of the day. Perhaps Methylphenidate causes that?
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?","I work long hours sometimes and my dr prescribed Concerta 54mg and 2 x 10mg of Ritalin. 

When it all wears off, my brain goes into overload and I literally never shut up. 

I feel so sorry for my husband sometimes."
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?",Exact same “journey” as mine! Started on 5mg too but switched to concerta. Been years now on it. Unfortunately in the UK recently we’ve had shortages and I’ve had to switch to generics (still extended release).
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?","Adderall IR made me angry (or so my mom claimed, lol, could have just been the regular pre-teen girl fighting with her undiagnosed and unmedicated ADHD mom stage) when I was first diagnosed when I was 12. I’m 37 now and have been taking it for the last 10 years probably and I’ve been fine. 

I’m sure my meds would made me feel more drained at the end of the day if they wore off like they were suppose to. I take Nexium for GERD so I produce less stomach acid so now the adhd meds don’t wear off like they should so I have to take Ambien at night to sleep. But if I don’t take the adhd meds, I don’t need the Ambien to sleep. 

I do remember when I was younger and just starting out on meds, I did get drained towards the end of the day, which made homework very difficult."
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?","Vyvanse only lasts me 6 hours before I crash... crashing right now. On work days, I fall off at 2-3pm"
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?","Vyvanse does pretty well for me too, I start to dip quite a bit after 12 hours but not horribly and really can’t expect much more from a medication then that."
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?","This! I've only been on my starting dose a short time, but can definitely tell when it's wearing off. I think I just fall back into my old self at that point...sitting on the sofa contemplating a nap. 🤣"
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?",Are you still on the lowest starting dose ? It's probably too low and I presume the doctor will look to increase it ? I remember my starting dose used to make me fall asleep
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?",I am doing this now and the IR is making me super nauseous. Even thrown up. 20 mg ER in the am and 10 mg IR for afternoon. Hate the IR. I don’t really feel it and makes me feel worse most days. I probably need to do a 10 mg ER for afternoon I suppose.
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?","What goes up, must come down "
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?",yeah downside is sleeping may be impossible lol
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?","Might be my imagination, but I think Ritalin works better.  
But remembering to take it, every 3 hours is a problem.  
Tried 18 mg Concerta, I thought 5mg of Ritalin 3 x a day was a little better.  
Now on 36 mg Concerta, I think 10mg of Ritalin  3x a day was a little better."
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?","I take a prescription acid reflux med (Dexilant) and this has not been my experience unless I forget to eat all day. If I'm eating regularly, I'm good. If I take my meds too late, I definitely have issues falling asleep, but that's why I don't take them after 9:30 am. It's fascinating how meds affect everyone differently!"
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?","Watch out taking PPIs for too long, low stomach acid means you can be vulnerable to all kinds of issues such as SIBO or just straight up infections like H Pylori, the acid helps protect you."
"For those who’s taking ritalin / stimulants, does it drain you towards the end of the day?",8 hours sleep? Never heard of her.

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,">my coworkers tell me I’m autistic because of how I act and laugh about it

Ugg, this reminds me of my coworker... they always close the door when it's ajar when they pass it (the locks are on the older side, so if you don't push it hard enough they swing a bit open again), commenting with ""* chuckle * I'm a bit autistic when it comes to stuff like that"". Like, no, you're not autistic, you have no idea what it is like to be autistic or how hard it affects one's life. ""Autism"" is not a synonym for ""superfocused on certain details"", ADHD is not a synonym for ""being an airhead sometimes"", OCD is not a synonym for ""perfectionist"", giftedness is not a synonym for ""a young modern Einstein with 4 phd's and a bright future"",... I haven't had a formal diagnoses yet (all the symptoms though, and then some) but at least I can manage with coping mechanisms at the moment. And I know I'm lucky to be able to do that. Doesn't mean everyone can manage it like that as well. It's good neurological disorders get more attention, but they should be getting more _medical_ attention, not ""know-it-all"" ers's attention. They are just making the same mistake as the generation before, only in a different way, causing a lot of people to not get diagnosed properly."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"The awareness is great and helped me start to question with my therapist if some of the symptoms I experience might be ADHD related which led to an eventual formal diagnosis. But especially being diagnosed late definitely makes it hard to take myself seriously, because my imposter syndrome is just like “ah just jumping on another bandwagon to explain how lazy you are” and I feel like I can’t discuss it honestly with most people because of the terminally-online people who have turned it into a whole personality and/or trend. It’s neither of those — it just sucks. There are bright spots of course, and the medication helps, but it mostly just sucks and can be crippling and it’s frustrating to feel like I can’t even take my own diagnosis seriously as a result."

Boss: oh my boyfriend has it too, everyone has adhd a little. Read a pamphlet from HR and it’ll be fine.

My bosses boss: Uh huh. Well I’m denying your request for PTO and ignoring your request for accommodations. 

The CEO: oh I have ADHD too. I get bored at meetings and really hate it so my kind wanders. But you just gotta find the things you really don’t like and force yourself to do them. 

—

Whole thing felt like a joke. 

I only got my PTO when I sarcastically and angrily told him (after he asked what did I’d do if he denied any PTO at all) that I guess I’d just blow my brains out because I can’t take this anymore.

That got me about 4 days off. But I was told mental health is only a “one day issue, that’s why it’s a MENTAL HEALTH DAY. Mental health doesn’t take multiple days” 

My doctor had a field day in the letter he wrote about how I needed accommodation but it still got ignored and I ended up getting fired for “other reasons”."

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Buddy, they're tryna become tiktok famous, they don't give a fuck if their content affects some negatively. Most of them would do just about anything to anyone if they could get away with it and have a chance at more attention. *Best* case scenario, they don't *care* if they're causing harm.

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Omg, it's the absolute worst. My previous manager knew I had ADHD for a year without issue, but then started seeing Tiktoks that told him that even though people with ADHD had challenges, they also had ""superpowers."" This led him to start putting me in situations way above my level where he thought I'd excel, only to be disappointed when I'd crash and burn.

ADHD gives me ZERO advantages. It's a disability. It's crippling. I adapt to medications very quickly, so I'm constantly having to rotate meds. I have to work twice as hard and for far longer than my peers to achieve the same results, so I'm constantly burned out. I'm terrified of being in poverty when I'm elderly and can't keep it up anymore.

So when people talk about ""ADHD superpowers,"" it's very upsetting."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,Everyone does ADHD things just not as extreme as ADHD people. No one’s attention is perfect it’s a spectrum. Those videos everyone can relate to and everyone thinks they’re ADHD. But when your attention is so bad it makes it hard to live life that’s when it’s ADHD obviously. It discredits actual ADHD people imo.
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"yeah it’s annoying as fuck. Everybody suddenly has ADHD.. Do you go to therapy? no.. Do you take daily your medication? no.. Did you fuck up your life, lose every second day something, can’t start doing anything and when you do you lose focus, are you a complete mess and hate your life for it.. It’s everytime cringe when random people say this and you can’t even condomn anybody because well you can’t be 100% that the person doesn’t have it and at the end you don’t want to be judged either. But from the sheer amount of people that claim to have adhd and are highly successful and completely functional I’m 100% sure that it’s just trendy to claim that. People somehow connect adhd with being creative. idiots"

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"As a kid in the 80s and 90s in Australia, you were either labelled as “gifted” or with ADHD. The kids I saw who were diagnosed ADHD tended to be othered by teachers (intentionally or otherwise). It was very much a diagnosis tied to disruptive/aggressive classroom behaviour. 

Thing is, because I’d been assessed as “gifted” at age 4, nobody seemed to twig that I had ADHD, even though I was disruptive and aggressive myself in many ways in primary school. I think there was a tendency to conflate ADHD in kids with low socioeconomic backgrounds back then, too."

Someone will make a post about something so ridiculous (last post that was taken down was about how adhd gave poster rigid morals and poster said in comments that adhd gave her ""strong opinions""). What I saw was just a sea of approval from almost every commenter. 

Not every personality trait is because of adhd.

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Yeah man. The commodification of our experience as quirky, mostly positive, or at the very least humorous, online content is frustrating. It’s similar to how Hollywood went through a phase of representing Autism as being a superpower that made you super smart and super focused, and mostly neglected how intensely it impacts day to day life.

I don’t particularly appreciate how it impacts the perception those around me have of me either. Any oversimplification of a life altering disability or experience is going to seriously harm the lives of those who suffer with it. 

I find it hard to blame folks who don’t get it, though. They’re mostly ignorant to the struggle we live through because they’ve only seen what the other people posting have. 

I also think there is some benefit to their existence. Even if it does suck that they’re spreading such false information about our experience, there is some truth, and a number of folks who have ADHD may feel motivated to seek a diagnosis after seeing one. 

While I get you, I think there’s some good in the bad, and that should be acknowledged too."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"According to my therapist this is true for a lot of mental health-related internet content. People then end up misunderstanding anxiety disorders and depression and OCD. It causes people who, for example, get anxious easily when stressful situations happen to think they have an anxiety disorder - when in fact, being anxious in stressful situations is exactly what anxiety is for and when you have a disorder you have the anxiety when there are no stressors. So then people act like all I'd need to combat an anxiety disorder is to make a to do list, have a glass of wine and take a bath because it works for them."

I'm on my second med (ritalin didn't work for me) and not at a therapeutic dose yet but I'm really hoping it helps as I'm so tired of living in chaos"
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"People who mistakenly think they have ADHD don't make my life hard.

Lawmakers who write laws that restrict my ability to access my medication in a sane and timely manner do.

People who equate the symptoms of my disorder with laziness, carelessness, or childishness do. 

The complete and appalling lack of meaningful support for adults with ADHD, that really fucks me over. If you don't have a comorbid ""serious"" issue like IDD or some other problem, you can fuck right off the fucksville when it comes to support for adults. You will spend a lot of time reading resources written to adult parents of children with ADHD. You see mental health professionals whose training is generally in talking to non-ADHD parents of ADHD children or in solely treating children with ADHD. If you're a POC or woman, good fucking luck in finding a provider who wasn't trained on a model based on hyperactive little white boys. 


In summary, I rate ""tiktok ADHD"" pretty low on the list of things that cause me issues as someone with ADHD."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I share your frustration. I suffered through 31 years of intense, undiagnosed, untreated ADHD. Took that long to get a psych eval because I was raised by a religious fundie dad who thought psychiatrists are all quacks, psych meds are poison, and any kind of mental health condition short of schizophrenia was just an excuse for the behavior of weak, undisciplined, morally inferior people.

When I finally went to a doctor and got the diagnosis, it contextualized literal decades of embarrassment, shame, brain fog, social anxiety, and low self esteem (largely due to the fact that it took every ounce of my mental energy to complete basic daily tasks that my peers appeared to handle effortlessly.)

Now that I'm on medication, it's made a massive difference in my quality of life, BUT I've gone through four different prescribers in the past three years before landing on my current doctor, because apparently having a prescription for stimulants at the age of 33 automatically makes a lot of doctors and pharmacists assume that you're just an addict. I've had doctors grill me multiple times about my (mostly non-existant) recreational drug history, refuse to fill my prescription without me giving a drug test (despite the fact that I've done nothing that even appears to be suspicious), the last one tried to take me off of tge only medication that's ever made a difference in my symptoms, EVERY TIME I had an appointment with her. 

The last straw was when she decided to (without consulting or even informing me) only fill three weeks worth of my meds instead of a full month, causing me to run out of my medication halfway through a week-long family vacation in a different state, the last three days of which were spent in a miserable, incoherent fog. She failed to return my phone calls for two weeks, and when she finally did get back to me, she informed me that she ""thought that I wouldn't really need the full month's scrip, since I was on vacation"". She also tried to use the fact that I called her several times and left her a sharply-worded voicemail inquiring about why I hadn't received my full prescription, as evidence that I ""had a problem"" and shouldn't be on stimulants. 

Luckily I found a much better (and less ideologically motivated) prescriber after that, and things have been better, but fuck. There is SO MUCH ignorance and stigma around having this condition as an adult. Seems like more than half of people (including doctors) don't really believe that adult ADHD is even a legitimate condition."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Yeah. I am both happy and worried bc of the newfound social media awareness. I have been diagnosed by three different professionals (PCP, Clinical Psych and Psychiatrist) and have been having great results with the meds (Vyvanse 50mg). But once I say I have ADHD some people instantly think its a Tik Tok Diagnosis and kind of dismiss it. It’s not only with ADHD tho - I have read about people with (real) ASD, Tourettes, hEDS, POTS and Crohns that feel similiar - these are (of course) ALL real and scientifically proven diseases, but because of the sometimes unspecific symptoms, many people self-diagnose based on Social Media Hype and this invalidates the experiences of those with a real diagnosis."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,That's why I never publicly sayi have it I don't want to be grouped in with those weirdos. The way people just loosely throw around ADHD and ocd when they don't have it. I don't think it's funny that I can't hold a job and almost burn my house down. Feeling like you're doing everything right and realize there's probably a major dateline you missed because you wanted to do the first thing right. It's a game to them
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I understand your frustration, and let me say how sorry I am.
The gloryfication of ADHD is indeed frustrating, and it's not ✨️ADHD✨️ but 😡😤ADHD🔥🏠. However for me these videos creeping into my feed gave me the final push to get a diagnosis, and they also help a ton with feeling alianted and different. It sends the message that I am not weird just different and other people share the same daily struggles.
P.S. I think it's just a matter of critical thinking, encourage everyone around you to watch well-researched and well-sourced videos. Good luck!"
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"People who are dismissive will always find a reason to be dismissive.  


Some people who self diagnose do so incorrectly; but almost everyone who is ADHD as in has it as an adult has to self diagnose to some degree.  


I had massive sinus problems for years and years and years. Never once did my ENTs suggest removing my tonsils. One day my nurse aunt told me I have to tell them to take them out. When they finally came out the ENT had never seen worse tonsils in his entire career and had to scan them for cancer because of how only cases with cancer he had seen so bad. Luckily they found no cancer but still. Even career doctors can fail you despite nearly a decade of training and and a decade of practice."

That's just my home office, imagine what happens when the stresses of life happen"
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"What about the people that grew up in an environment where mental health wasn’t really a thing? And it wasn’t until lurking subs like this one that they finally started to put the pieces together and ask questions and dig a little deeper to try and understand the disorder and in the process of doing so realizes they display almost all the symptoms and as a result decide to make an appointment for an evaluation to get a diagnosis because they’ve gone their whole life as unstable mess but convinced themselves that’s how everyone else was too and that, and that that was just how it is. I can definitely understand where your coming from though, but for some people if it weren’t for more awareness they might have never even considered that ADHD might affect them. I don’t have my diagnosis yet but I look forward to getting some help. I used to think I was bipolar or something but the symptoms correlate more closely to ADHD unless I happen to have both idk that’s why I’m going to the doctor. Like how many jobs do you have to quit/ lose or how many times do you have to change careers or how fucked up does your life have to be to need help? How bad do your mood swings need to be, your general sense of irritability and frustration combined with your general lack of patience. How many times do you need to walk into room and forget what you were going to do/ what you were doing.

Edit: not trying to be contrite honestly I’ve just gone back and forth with myself over whether I really have a disorder or I just think I do but why would I have the symptoms if I don’t and if I don’t then why do I have the symptoms. It’s driving me nuts I get to see the doctor Tuesday I just want some relief and to feel more “normal”"
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I read somewhere that 90% of tiktoks about adhd contain misinformation, lol.

I guess I can’t really judge bc I learned the symptoms of adhd and that I might have it from tumblr back in the day, but I actually went out and sought an official diagnosis. I know some people don’t have access to diagnosis and I get that it’s hard to get, but I still don’t think people should be spreading misinformation online. it does feel embarrassing to tell people I have adhd sometimes, especially in front of my older coworkers. I’m 26 so out of the tiktok target demographic and I’ve never downloaded or used that app at all, but I’m still younger than most of my coworkers and I feel like some of my coworkers make jokes about how ‘kids these days all think they have adhd’ and i’m never sure if they’re directed at me :("
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"it's definitely tough because on one hand, the increase in visibility of first hand accounts of ADHD is what led me to start researching it myself. I went to therapy off and on through my life as well struggling a lot in school and spending plenty of time in the guidance counselors office and never once had the idea even been floated. And I had always had that common misconception that ADHD is something they diagnose kids with for behaving like little kids and not little adults. Seeing people talk about how it has affected their life outside of hyperactivity (and often excluding hyperactivity) really resonated with me and I can't overlook that it was a crucial step towards seeking a diagnosis and treatment. 

Anyway, on the other hand, it definitely has led to a lot of oversimplification of ADHD and its applicability to literally any behavior. I think I can understand the impulse to ascribe so much of your behavior to ADHD, because for me that discovery to diagnosis process was a near constant ""OH SO THATS WHY I."" so naturally you want to apply to to so many other traits. I don't think there's anything wrong with self examination and wondering how certain traits relate to ADHD. I think a lot of times people mistake caused by/symptom of for exacerbated by. And then on the internet there is a tendency to imply some kind of universality to your own experiences. Some may think to add the disclaimer that they are only talking about themselves, but I think a lot of people forget that step and go straight to their word as gospel. 

Personally, I would rather search for ADHD advice and see people with ADHD (wherever they are in the diagnosis process) talking about their experience, versus what is still far more common which is advice aimed at parents of ADHD children. as though the only impact of ADHD is on the people who have to deal with them, and not the person themselves, and that it only affects children."

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,People suck
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I feel this hard. I think the problem is closely associated with amphetamine culture and abuse in Uni.

People think it’s a joke or don’t understand how we cognitively function different and can’t control our focus. It’s hard to understand how someone can view the world differently… and we just attach labels to ourselves to explain lapses in understanding. It’s like the tip of the iceberg - people see the tip and go “wow look how small that is” and laugh it off without looking in the water.

I had a guidance counselor who told me my good grades / test scores (1560 SAT / 36 ACT) were just because I was on medication and I wouldn’t make it in the real world. He then didn’t submit my test scores to my college. The perception that we are using drugs as some sort of performance enhancing drug to get an edge on everyone else is pretty common.

Also the misappropriation of ADHD casually (most cognitive disorders really) makes it worse. A rowdy kid who may just want attention or is out bursting is casually called ADHD. Or if friends can’t focus there’s a lot of “oh yeah I’m so adhd too”.

I find this a lot with my autoimmune disorder - and any experience in life. If people haven’t experienced it’s hard for them to conceptualize the full scope of the impact of these things. I’ll talk about my RA and the response is usually “oh yeah my hands totally get sore after a long day”.

That’s why having real discussion and compassion and openness with these things are so important."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Couldn’t agree with you more.

Your psychiatrist sounds mediocre at best, though, and like a quack at worst. A psych saying something “should have worked” is a psych who doesn’t know what they’re doing. No one med works reliably for an entire group of people. 

-Ritalin turned me into a zombie

-Vyvanse made me feel like Bruce Banner (very on my game, very intolerant of other’s bullshit)

-Adderall made me anxious and jittery

I really don't experience this phenomenon of ""everyone has ADHD nowadays"" in real life, like at all.

TikToks listing some things that *may* be symptoms are annoying, sure, but whose fault is it if you're choosing to interpret a 30-second TikTok as a diagnostic tool? I imagine hardly any of them are meant to be that."

Instead they use it as an excuse for verious things. It's not all of them but it's noticeable and very similar behaviour to what was going on when i was a teenager and Had Depression.
I think in the end there's Always gonna be ups and downs about it. But i have not really encountered any people berating me for having adhd yet so maybe that's why i don't Care that much. It is true though that with adhd comes alot of suffering, but still i like to make light off it and i don't think that's a Bad thing"
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I complained for years and finally put my foot down. Received my diagnosis at 43. 

I think what a lot of people don’t understand is that ADHD was not something that was easily diagnosed for some of us back in the 80’s and 90’s because in the past, a lot of providers looked for the extreme symptoms. Also, being a woman, you are dismissed pretty much right off the bat if you try to suggest what you suspect. 

A lot of us middle aged women have reached the “fuck this, I have no fucks left to give,” and are now overly assertive.

I had an amazing boss who taught me that it was ok to push back. She would tell me stories about how she would go to doctors with a complaint and the doctor would immediately dismiss her and not bother to doing any testing. 

For me it was:

“You don’t have ADHD.”

“Ok great, let’s do all the testing to make sure that is correct.”

“Oh wait…”

It’s annoying that people think that being diagnosed is a fad instead of what it really is: the medical community repeatedly failed many of us and we put our foot down."

As far as the whole trendy thing goes I hate it too. There are a lot of really good ADHD/ASD Content creators and seems like they take a back seat to these asshats.

 I feel you on hardly being able to function. I once misplaced an entire prescription and my husband got upset because it was important for me to have my medication and he said “you just can’t be so forgetful!” I told him, “I HAVE ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER. I literally cannot help what my brain remembers and forgets.” He apologized and said he knows it’s hard for me and he felt bad for getting upset. I am sure it’s difficult living with my spacey ass but he loves me and encourages me a lot. 

I am in the process of being on a higher dose of strattera and it would have totally messed me up if I didn’t have them (went from 40 mg to 80 mg) it does seem to help somewhat but not as much as 30xr adderall.

Except if they pack for a trip they might forget one thing and remember it right before heading out. However it's a heavy burden for me like when I pack for a trip I remember something 10 minutes away, turn around, grab it, then remember something else, turn around, grab it, then an hour into the trip remember I forgot my pillow or something I really needed.

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Hey mate, it's ok, you're alright. 

I'm not being critical, I just observe that maybe you're panicking a bit with your situation?  Which is fair enough. ADHD is difficult! I just encourage you to try to be patient and kind with yourself (which is also difficult!) and with those around you, who probably don't/can't really understand what life can be like for you.

I take vyvanse 70mg and occasionally have to top up with 5-10mg of Dexedrine in the afternoon. I was lucky and hit on the right medicine for me straight away, but from what I understand, it can take time for different individuals to find the medication that works for them, so don't give up. Perhaps 20mg is to low a dose for your tolerance? Hopefully you can discuss and explore these possibilities with your Dr.

As far as tiktok goes, I would just ignore it and focus on more helpful ADHD related material. I strongly recommend checking out the [Hacking Your ADHD ](https://pca.st/podcast/fa829090-cc14-0137-1e16-0acc26574db2) podcast. Although I was medicated for 2 years, I don't think I really appreciated or accepted what it really means to have ADHD until I started listening. It's really great.

I appreciate the awareness of ADHD that is growing in many (anglophone, at least) countries, and that the TikTokers may have played a part in that. But the crassness of using and styling your ADHD as a vehicle for some kind of fame or money making is inauthentic, annoying, selfish, lacking in self awareness, creates unnecessary cynicism and generally becomes more and more counterproductive for people with ADHD.

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Nah I don't like gatekeeping neurological disorders that are notoriously hard to get diagnosed for here if you aren't male or pay to go privately... My entire family is autistic so my idea of what an average person looked like with average traits was impossible to spot. My inattentive ADHD is mostly inattentive to myself because I'm the last to know. Im also autistic myself so yeah my ""self read"" is extremely low. 34 years old my ways of coping just broke after covid and having kids, I thought I was crazy. 




Tiktok fucking saved me. I was laughing like.. jeez these people think everything is adhd I do all this shit and more. And sure, the key is frequency, and I'm sure there's some faking it for attention. But it was an amazing starting point for me. I bought Russel barkelys book and some others and started research, everything was lighting up more and more lightbulbs. Saved up and went to a private psychiatrist, said its fucking obvious i have it and have always had it. Checked my school reports, talked to family etc.


Medical misogyny is incredibly real. Gatekeeping information is incredibly real. Communities of frustrated and lost people who just got diagnosed and are passionate about educating people are real. Self diagnosis is real-not watching 5 tiktoks and self diagnosing, but sparking the focus to do science backed research into credible sources, yes. That's valid self diagnosing. I knew by the time I went to the psychiatrist it didn't matter what he said, I had it. And treating myself like I did and using tools like I did actively helped me. And now it's official I hope meds can really help more too.


It's not that I haven't struggled. I really have. I've been to some incredibly dark places,frequently. I was actually quite comfortable suffering and directing the brunt of everything internally and at myself, but it's when I started to effect my kids that I sought help. Even so, I really don't get this particular subs seeming focus on the negative. Keeping optimistic in the face of a crippling disorder is one of the main things that keeps me going. Laughing at tiktoks that make fun of my eccentricities and issues brightens my days.



Legit licensed professionals are also sharing easily accessible information in small enough sections that I can focus on what is pertinent to me. People like KC Davis have been instrumental in me treating and letting go one of my worst issues, of guilt and shame of not reaching a certain standard.



Does all of that come with a few random teenagers forgetting why they came in a room and harkening back to old school Internet ""lol I'm so random, cringe""? Sure. They've always been there and they always will be there."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"It’s funny cuz the most difficult part of ADHD for me is the lesser talked about symptoms of it. 

Like emotional dysregulation, easily overstimulated, increased sensitivity physically & mentally, impulsivity (for me it’s impulsively putting something down without realizing it, leading to “forgetting”—not really forgetting but never had  acknowledged where I put it down, and so I look forgetful. As well as impulsively saying what’s on my mind during a conversation because if I don’t say it at that exact moment I will forget it), sleep problems, storing memory & navigating that stored memory in the brain, executive dysfunction.. I mean the list goes on. 

ADHD is *not* “I forgot my lunchbox”, its *much more* then that, that’s just the tip of iceberg."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Yeah, this. I fucking hate it.

Fun fact:

A lot of this is due to COVID. During COVID, many barriers to access medication/forms of therapy were lifted in order to make remote access easier and more accommodating. So these companies popped up and started pushing pills, telling everyone they may have adhd for the smallest, dumbest reasons.

And now due to that and other reasons, theres a shortage of adderall. 

I was diagnosed at an extremely young age. Meds made me wanna kms and i did try in 4th grade. People now just say they have it because they watched a stupid tiktok designed to go viral, or they got curious and went to one of these virtual-meeting “psychs” capitalizing on loopholes who wanna push pills for $. 

If you want to know if you have adhd, go to a fucking real doctor. They will straight up TEST YOU. And any good psych doesnt wanna give you fucking schedule 2 drugs, so they’re not going to just let you slide in a lot of cases. 

People glamorize it. I have to take my embarrassing little task/goal whiteboard if i have guests and mute a billion reminders on my phone if im out and phone not on silent. I take twice as long as anyone to do anything.

Shit sucks.

Social media/phone use causes a mild form of ADHD but unlike the real thing, minimizing SM/phone use will make these symptoms go away.

So for any of you that feels this applies to you: get  off reddit, go touch some grass, and go see a GOOD psychiatrist. Best you can afford."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Yeah my sister used to call ADHD a superpower because I used the term hyperfocus once to her. She was trying to be supportive but man it upset me. my GF hates when I'm hyperfocusing about something because she has to yell my name 5 times before I respond to anything. Super frustrating for her. I had to sit my sister down and explain that calling any disability a superpower doesn't feel good to the people actually experienceing the symptoms of that disability.

I really identify with what you said about being treated like a developing teenager because I forget things constantly. The look your co worker gives you when you forgot to grab the same price of equipment for the 5th time that day makes me cringe. Losing jobs because you forget to do basic tasks is the worst."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"This goes for a lot of disorders/mental illnesses.

The wrong people go way too hard to “spread awareness”, but all they do is cheapen these ailments and turn them into an aesthetic.

I think a lot of these types of loud internet people actually mean well. They feel that they’re doing a service by “spreading awareness” and pat themselves on the back without realizing that they themselves don’t even understand what they’re promoting.

I truly can’t stand when the normies highjack this type of stuff. They get to have everything else, and now they want to claim mental illness and brain disorders too because sometimes they’re in a bad mood and they were two days late on a homework assignment once. 

No part of this shit is cute, quirky, or fun."

You shouldn't invalidate someone else's experience just because their symptoms aren't as bad as yours. I could go off and say that in my experience your symptoms actually aren't that bad, and that you're giving everyone else with ""real ADHD"" a bad name.

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,Anyone with a brain knows these videos are rubbish. I know their annoying. Just trust that the majority of the population shares your opinion.
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I'm conflicted. Tiktok definitely helped me realize I have ADHD, but not from those derivative toks. I'm 38f and it explained so much - why everything was harder for me but was a walk in the park for others. And yes, I do have a formal diagnosis that indicated I was ""off the charts"" inattentive. However, I am not one to discount someone's lived experience if they don't have the funds, the time, or the executive function to obtain a diagnosis. 

Many women struggled for years not knowing they had ADHD because their symptoms don't match the stereotypical male symptoms. Folks vlogging about it on tiktok has created more conversation around it, which will hopefully lead to more research and more solutions for everyone. 

And just like with any trend, there's going to be moochers hopping on the bandwagon to gain followers or whatever. I think folks that truly struggle with ADHD scroll past those ones pretty quickly - they're usually not even accurate. 

For me at least, the trend has made it more comfortable for me to discuss it with others, including my employer (who's been awesome about it). I'll gladly correct folks that may have learned about ADHD from the top 10 videos but I've otherwise found the general public to be far more versed in it than they were when I was a kid."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"To be honest I don't think anyone apart for some researchers have really taking it seriously. Camon , ppl call ppl with adhd drug addicts always said there are two many ppl diagnosed with it , that its games fault and screen time, pahrnacists that Shane you ..the list goes on . To be honest I just don't care , makes no difference to me , it doesn't change the truth of it .If ppl around you don't understand it and make you feel like crap , they aren't your ppl."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I understand your frustrations, but I'm glad for the videos (I don't have tik tok, but I've seen a few on FB). I had 0 idea that inattentive ADHD was a thing. I've been feeling so overwhelmed, especially lately, because I can't ""adult"", I'm always running late, I can't keep organized, I forget about 90% of my meetings and deadlines, yet I keep being given more responsibilities. My anxiety and depression has been off the charts because I feel like I can't juggle everything and it's ruining my life and making me feel like failure of a wife. Like I feel like I'd be better off being single because my husband does so much for me and I don't have the energy to even put away the laundry he washes, or unload the dishwasher after he's loaded and ran it. At least if I was single, I wouldn't have to worry about him and how my need to disconnect from everything and shut down for an extended while would impact him.

Anyway, I definitely think I have inattentive ADHD, and I went in for a consult this past week and have an appointment with an actual psychiatrist at the end of August (3 months after my initial Convo with my PCP ...yay for the mental health system). While I was there I filled out a WURS, and after I turned it in, I looked up how it's scored. I'm 100% certain I will be diagnosed. I'm hoping meds will help me feel a little more centered and in control of my life... But I wouldn't have ever suspected ADHD if it hadn't been for the current hype.

... It is annoying though that my mom shrugs it off because I wasn't hyper (even though I've explained inattentive ADHD to her), and my coworker says ""all teachers have ADHD because we have to split our attention and make a thousand decisions a day"".. like no. You are not crippled by it. You don't need to take a nap some days before even attempting to drive home. You can go home and do things where I have 0 energy and can't accomplish even basic house cleaning during the school year. I'm 34 and can't imagine having kids because I can't even take care of myself. I can't wrap my head around how some people are teachers, parents and have time for a life or things like volunteering.

Long rant, but I hate posers of any type and am annoyed at all the people crying ADHD, but I sure am glad for the attention these videos are bringing because I'm definitely starting to understand myself better and I'm hopeful for medical help so I can have some peace of mind."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Every post like this on the sub is so hard because I feel the exact same way (I find myself defensively telling people about how my therapist proactively suggested the diagnosis and I had no inkling of it before that) — BUT there are so many people for whom the online awareness wave has been what allowed them to gain clarity about themselves and do something about it. 

I think we need to be careful only to criticize the people gaining money or clout from the hype train, not the people who are trying to figure out if they have ADHD because of it. Particularly given that access to care and quality of care are so insanely variable by location and SES."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"People with ADHD have NEVER been taken seriously, but at least there’s awareness of it now. Properly educate the people around you if it’s bothering you so much. My mom doesn’t have TikTok, but she still tells me “everyone deals with that, just move on”. ADHD has never been taken seriously and has always just been seen as “the kid who can’t sit still” and nothing more than that."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I'm incredibly grateful for the awareness because it would've never crossed my mind that I have ADHD. I got diagnosed with depression three years ago but always felt that there must be more to it - and it clicked when I saw a TikTok where they talked about how depression and burn-out can result from ADHD. I then got a first short assessment by my therapist. It's very clear to her already, but I'll have an additional 3 hour assessment in a few weeks with a psychiatrist.

What I find most annoying are the ""having a gf with adhd"", where the gf acts like a hyperactive infant that needs special treatment all the time. Even if this is the experience for some couples (idk) it still feels cringy the way it is portraied (like it was comedy) and I don't want people to think that this is what my ADHD-struggles look like..."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"This right here mods, this is why I'll always oppose the rule that we have to respect self diagnosis."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I get how it can be annoying, but it's not exactly the tiktoks fault (even though it does seem like it).
Before the recent awareness of ADHD on social media, I wouldn't be diagnosed. I definitely wouldn't have accepted my other issues were comorbid Autism either. Heck, my mother was diagnosed back in the 80's and she still tried to deny it was true for herself or me because of the old stereotypes. The tiktoks shed light on the wide diversity of profiles, and that's why they end up being so diversified and more ""neutral/good"" leaning than showing the struggles. Nobody wants to think something is wrong with them, especially people who have been shit on their whole lives for their undiagnosed (or diagnosed) ADHD.

The research shows it's still underdiagnosed even given the recent surge. People just dont want to accept that this neurological condition is ACTUALLY a normal and common condition of the human experience ~ and so the uneducated blame tiktok for what is actually a long-standing combined ego+lack of research issue in Psychology. 
For sure it is hard to function as someone with ADHD (and other comorbid issues that are common for us)...but it gets easier as you gather knowledge and confidence.

I've been in that headspace where I was severely depressed, to the point of meltdowns because I felt useless and a burden to others. I was struggling with managing everything in life and even questioned if I should be pursuing my degree. The solution took a while to sort out mentally and logistically, but I just doubled down on accepting my ADHD and either negotiating or forcing (lol) others around me to accept ""IT IS WHAT IT IS"". It's not my fault if others try to enforce unrealistic expectations in face of me trying to communicate.

Also, just as an aside ~ At 20mg you are still actually under the ""therapeutic dose"". I take 30mg Vyvanse (when needed, mostly for Uni or housework) and that is considered the ""mimimum"" to actually be in any way effective lmao (I dont take more because I also have GAD and it exacerbates my sensory issues too much). I'd definitely double check with your doctor why they are still putting you at a low dose...usually they only do that to make sure the effect strength is desirable and not causing any weird side effects ~ NOT as a regular dose to treat executive dysfunction.

Edit: typo"
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,Agreeeeeeed
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I fucking feel the pain at others making light of your condition. While I haven't been diagnosed, my life has been riddled with occurrences that strongly lead me to believe I have autism, ADHD, or both, to a minor/moderate degree. Not to mention reflecting on my mother's, father's, grandfather's, and uncle's actions/personalities. I've been mocked and laughed at by family for things I've said and done that I couldn't help doing/made sense to me. 

Now, not to make this about me. I would just add that it's worth remembering that for many--like, possibly, myself-- ADHD isn't quite so debilitating, but troublesome enough. That said, I agree, forgetting something every once in a while does not ADHD make. But as others have said, I would much rather have the hype so there's awareness than not. While ofc some still disregard it, there are now SO MANY more people who are aware of what their loved ones and strangers are suffering with and are more able to give them the compassion and support they deserve."

I didn’t. And now I see a psychiatrist for it. And my life is infinitely better now that I understand the way my brain works

As a woman, we are incredibly uneducated about adhd for women. I thank those videos for opening my world. 

I do agree many people on there are NOT qualified to be giving diagnosis and people who are not diagnosed as adhd should not be giving advice. But at the same time I’m not quick to judge and assume their story"

Yeah. It’s debilitating. I literally always just thought my brain was… broken and I couldn’t control myself on a daily basis. Like I would buy stuff, say stuff, do stuff, then not do anything. Randomly. I had no control. I was thousands in debt from impulsive purchases and hyper focusing on random products. I quit my well-paying job a year ago because it was so difficult to stay on track. I forget everything. My house is a mess. Yet I’m able to hyper focus on special interests until suddenly I never want to think about them again. It’s so exhausting that I went through many moments of feeling extremely dark thoughts. I’m medicated now and I haven’t found the right dose but I know there’s hope now and that my brain isn’t broken.

I hope that the folks who have adhd are able to find out and get help, maybe from these videos, but it’s very insensitive to create tiktoks with only the “fun quirky” side of adhd for internet follows and likes."

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I struggled these symptoms my whole life.

After a 2 day eval the psychiatrist couldn't believe that I had gotten this far in life given my testing results.   Starting Adderall and doing a deep dive into learning more about the disease process was life-changing. 

Fast forward to last year and I needed to switch Primary Care provder, he's right out of school.  He's going over my med list and says ""sorry, I don't prescribe adderall for anyone, it's just a performance enhancing drug, I could also take it if I wanted and I would function much better at work"".. it's very frustrating to hear that from a new physician.

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"It's worth recognizing that there are a number of causes of ADHD symptoms, and not having frontline meds (which both guanfacine and adderall are) work just means that you possibly have a different underlying mechanism for those symptoms, and thus need different meds.

[If you're not sensitive to norepinephrine, you may find atomoxetine (Strattera) helps.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomoxetine) (It actually did help my concentration, but I had to move off of it because it aggravates POTS.)

[Also, buproprion (Wellbutrin) has worked for many people.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bupropion)

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I had a late life diagnosis. Managed to muddle through life until menopause and then wham. Told my dr I thought I was developing dementia or something. I was worried about losing my job. Couldn’t remember meetings, couldn’t organize myself, couldn’t make myself do things that were boring but necessary. When I filled out all the questionnaires and answered all the questions in person, and the dr said yup, looks like ADHD, I was a bit flabbergasted. But a lot of things made more sense - my inability to keep friends as a kid, my never being able to do homework until the very last minute, all the things I started and never finished, getting into debt for very stupid things, so many things. 


Took awhile to figure out medication dose because when I felt like it wasn’t helping, I just stopped taking it and didn’t go back for a few months. Ritalin did nothing for me. Vyvanse at 20 and 40 mg- mostly nothing. I was chattier on 40- like just a bit more willing to have conversations , not talking off people’s ears. When I finally saw my dr many months later, the dr said I might need a higher dose. 60 mg was the magic for me. Holy cow did it make a difference. I’m still time-blind and forgetful. But it’s like whatever was getting in the way of being able to do the thing I need to do is gone. I had no idea how much anxiety was a problem until after finding the right med and dose. Felt like I had taken lorazepam rather than lisdexamphetamine. 

Anyhow. I get what you’re saying about all the hype. It’s like people glibly saying they are OCD about something. It minimizes the real struggle. At the same time, I kind of like seeing some of it because it helps to know I am not the only person who has problems. I hope you find the right medication for you."

Thankfully I’m largely around people who also have it so they understand the struggle, the plus side of this is that I can be myself around them, I’m also almost 30 and I gotta be honest I act childish as fuck but they say we are about 30% behind in “development” so at heart we’re basically 20 year olds trying to find our way in life."

25/30 is where things start to work. 30/35 is where I need to be to do much intellectual labor. 

Unfortunately, however, dosing has become way too conservative these days. My therapist thinks it has to do with the opioid crisis and prescribers making false equivalence fallacies or something. So unfortunately many people are getting underdosed now.

Or I'll say I struggle a bit with this. My usual way of dealing with it got interrupted so it led to making this mistake - sorry. 

This leads to much better understanding than putting a loaded label on it. And since ADHD is so widely known about, this runs the risk that people will figure out I have ADHD and then make assumptions about me. But the fact that knowledge about it is also so skewed means that people don't necessarily clock it because they think ADHD is all spacing out in conversations and having unhinged reactions to squirrels."

I always know exactly where car keys are, where my phone is, all that stuff. I can keep my house clean just fine and keep up with laundry. I'm also not depressed, I'm a fat jolly mofo like Santa Clause. 

But I also got fired from my last job because I just couldn't bring myself to complete tasks and performance slipped after the novelty wore off. I knew exactly what I needed to do, exactly how long it would take, but I couldn't get past that step. Total mental block about following through on anything. Even now with a new job, can't even watch 5 minutes of a training video without pausing it at least 10 times to go down infinite rabbit holes about anything that pops in my head. I have 20+ outlook reminders of project tasks that pile up, some I've snoozed for 3 weeks straight. Takes like an hour to complete a 2 minute task, even with maximum effort. Had to download an app on my phone to block most phone apps during work hours. Someone should make a tiktok about that shit"

Like yeah. I may be fucking amazing in a crisis situation but I also had a full on meltdown bc I couldn't find my glasses yesterday.

I briefly went off meds when finding out I was pregnant and those 5 weeks were fucking awful. I couldn't function, I couldn't get anything done. I wasn't starting a million new hobbies, I did nothing. I went from showering every day and washing my hair 2-3 times a week to showering twice every 10 days. I couldn't hold a single thought, which left me paralysed and the boredom was unbearable. 
I'm back on a lower dose now and while I feel I need to up it maybe a lil, its helped a fair ammount. I can collect my thoughts better, I can do some tasks easier. Showering, whilst not back to being every day is every 2 days, sometimes 3.

Idk I'm rambling bc lisdex has well and truly worn off now but basically I wish people talked about the bad things as much as they talk about the positives."

The symptoms people see online are only the surface issues. I was diagnosed and thought yes I tick all these symptoms but then when you deep dive into each of these they make your day to day life so much more complex and harder than what it needs to be.

I saw an analogy on Reddit once, "" my life is like an I ternet explorer window with 15+ tabs open some are active some are not""

For me this analogy is so true in all my life not just work. all these tabs are open constantly and I can't close them or I will forget something. When I go back to a tab I go off down another rabbit hole again. Then on another tab and look at that for 5 mins and go off on something else.

I have lost friends due to my ADHD issues like not calling people back or not doing what I said I would because I forget and people think you just don't care

There is so many more examples of how major this disorder is to me and everyone else who suffers that you don't read too much about online you can only understand once you live with it

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Hey, my ADHD specialist told me that you need to get actual restful sleep in order for most ADHD medications to work; i was on Adderall as well and only noticed benefits the first week before things came crumbling down again. He, after looking at my diagnosis for sleep apnea, asked me if I've been using my CPAP. When I said no(because of ADHD and OCD making it nearly impossible) he told me that's probably why the Adderall wasn't working.

Especially if you snore, I'd recommend seeing if you can have a sleep study done. If your brain can't do it's thing at night, Adderall (apparently) won't do it's thing during the day. And sleep apnea is literally not breathing, which means your brain gets less oxygen at night. Which is harmful for so many reasons.

This is also a big reminder that I have to schedule another auto study or figure out with my insurance how to get another CPAP machine. Thanks for the reminder lol"

I lose my wallet two or three times *every morning* and it’s not in the least bit funny.

Def not going to read all these I am sure hopefully helpful replies but want to add 2 points on the off chance they havent been mentioned 

1. Apparently guanfacine and stimulants can be synergistic so if you havent, it might be worth trying both. I take guanfacine at night and dex in the day. I have very very subtle improvements to the point I only realise when I havent taken them. Super frustratingly subtle compared to the stories you hear about but very real.
2. I saw an ADHD specialist psychologist recently (I already have a psychologist but they arent ADHD experienced and the difference even in that one meeting was amazing so I wish I had met the ADHD specialist one earlier) and they said anecdotally, it seems that people with both ADHD and autism do not have that life changing response we hear about. And given the prevalence of co-morbid ADHD and autism, they dont even screen for one without the other and suggested I also get screened for autism. 

Best of luck. I wouldnt wish the challenges I experience on anyone."

Nobody understands the shame you feel for being so dumb. Offered an interview and didn’t check email in time to go. I can’t even explain why I didn’t check. I wanted this job so badly.

However, people are really bad in the way they self-diagnose themselves, or 'promote' it on social media. I hear so many people these days who literally will describe someone who is energetic as 'ADHD', like, please, don't use a proper term as an adjective! I also think that these accounts on social media almost make ADHD seem mainstream, or a regular issue? Like, they act as if ADHD is a normal thing every single person has. It makes it seem less valid, like, ""Oh, I get distracted too."" I feel like its a really shitty way for people to try and be sympathetic, or even at times, just to get attention. Mental health has almost become a 'trend' on social media, which whilst it's amazing that people are finally removing the stigma around it, I feel like it's being joked about way too often and medical terms are being misused way too regularly. It gives me the ick when people call themselves 'OCD' for liking to be organised. No, OCD isn't just wanting to colour code your pens. No, ADHD isn't just being super energetic and unfocused.

I just pretend I don't have OCD and also think OCD is just being organized or clean (it has nothing to do with that AT ALL) unless the person seems open minded to listen/discuss what OCD actually is and  what kind of HELL it puts a person through.

Where I'm from, people also think having ADHD is just being hyperactive/restless. That's gotta be like the LEAST harmful symptom, if harmful at all, and many of us don't have it (not visibly anyway, mental hyperactivity just makes you look zooned out while in reality you might be freaking out)."

I feel embarrassed trying to explain to somebody that I have ADHD and what that means, because the general public perception of what ADHD entails seems to be heavily centered on the misinformed belief that ADHD is a silly, trendy, and largely harmless thing. Every time I have to explain it, I feel like the other person is doing internal eye rolls and imagining that I just really like Invader Zim and pretending to be distracted by shiny objects or somesuch.

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"This is why I don’t really talk about mine very often. If someone asks me then I tell them but otherwise I keep it to myself. What’s happening with ADHD now is the same thing that happened with Anxiety and Depression in the late 90s and early 20s. It’s been sensationalized and because of that, everyone walks around saying they have it when most of them don’t. I think the reason for this is because pretty much all ADHD symptoms are things that everyone experiences from time to time; so people think they have it because they experienced hyper focusing or time blindness or executive distinction. What they don’t realize it that it’s the the consistency and duration of the symptoms that distinguishes between having ADHD and just having the odd symptom from time to time. Hopefully this will eventually balance out but my biggest concern is the amount of people that are being prescribed medication for it that they don’t actually need. It’s creating a pandemic of amphetamine addiction that we won’t be able to meet the medical treatment needs to correct. And instead of people dealing with the trauma that came from 3 years of Covid Quarantining and Social Distancing, they are all just getting put on incredibly dangerous medication that they don’t need in order to cope."

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Sometimes having this weird little brain disorder is fun because I can crochet super fast ALL FUCKING DAY and LOVE IT (I also learn new hobbies or skills fast with what feels like no effort and I absolutely love that about myself), but usually… and that means most of the time, it fucking sucks. I am sailing that ship with you. This is not a “quirky” disorder. It effects every facet of life, to the point that most things feel like they’re challenging the very essence of who I am. We have to fight against ourselves, constantly, to fit in and function in the society we exist in. With adhd, existing is exhausting - never mind everything else we have to do so that the culture were currently in, doesn’t turn against us. 

I just don’t tell anyone but those who are required to know. My doctor, my partner, my son. Otherwise, what’s the point? My medication is stigmatized. My existence is trivialized and questioned. I would be told that I make all the wrong choices in life that *thats* why I’m like this, not because of any kind of neurological mis…wiring in my mothers womb that I had no choice or say in whatsoever. 

Having adhd isn’t ever something to fucking **want**, but if you experience it… acceptance is where it’s at. Education on adhd. The trend of it all right now is like other have mentioned, a double edged sword. You have people who think it’s cool and will pretend to have it, for whatever reason their unconscious mind has chosen. It’s caused even more people to look at us with discontent - But with that negativity, comes more awareness and understanding from the outside as well. And a lot of it.

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"First of all, I feel like you're fighting this so hard. You can start by forgiving yourself, that so much of this isn't your fault AT ALLLLL. My biggest breakthroughs came with understanding my diagnosis and accepting it's part of who I am. You should probably read ""So I'm not Lazy, Crazy, or Stupid?"" It might go a long way to feeling better about yourself. The beating yourself up is so counterproductive to progress, you can't even imagine. Learning to love myself, ADHD and all,  made everything so much easier. Also if you want something solid from me, create written task lists in a notebook and prioritize those tasks into 1, 2, 3 or 4.

1 => Important & Urgent

2=> Not Important but Urgent

3=> Important but not Urgent

4=> Not Important, not Urgent

This book stays with you at all times. Now if you only focus on getting your #1's done, you've had a pretty successful day. Checking off tasks also gives you a dopamine spike which helps you continue to get things done. But it can turn a day of ""I have so much to do!!!!"" Into ""I have 2 #1's today. Anything else is gravy."" Writing down your tasks also keep them from ruminating around your head. This habit doesn't form overnight (partly because ADHD prevents us from forming ""habits"" the way others do) but over time it will release so much internal stress."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I was diagnosed late but pre-TikTok/adhd online virality, just barely. I wonder if there actually was a noticeable uptick in diagnosis, especially for adults, prior to a lot of this content taking off? Like maybe a movement within the mental health/medical community to look for symptoms in their adult patients? My doctor completely floored me by diagnosing adhd but we were dealing with years of anxiety and depression that meds couldn’t touch. ADHD made sense to her and now I cannot believe no dr before her ever saw it. My doctors now are like lol yeah obviously. 

It is frustrating to have it treated as a trend, but I do appreciate the broader understanding I get by seeing other ADHD folks’ experience. I think the weakness comes from the anecdotal “do you do this? That’s ADHD!” 2 people with ADHD can have 2 diametrically opposed personalities, habits, etc. ADHD doesn’t make you messy or super organized, always late or always early, forgetful or extremely precise. The ADHD makes the executive function and processing in your brain not work right. How you compensate, cope, or mask to deal with that deficiency is going to look different and sometimes completely opposite in different people. So it’s helpful to me to see people who aren’t the stereotypical adhd “personality” because that can be validating as someone who went undiagnosed for so long.  But from the outside, it definitely comes across as every quirk, habit, or outright normal behavior is a sign of adhd and that’s pretty frustrating when it’s used to undercut the validity of your diagnosis."

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I just wanna say that the journey to finding the right medication can be very long. There's no single right solution for anyone and everyone's bodies react differently to medication. 

When I was first diagnosed, I tried about 5 different ADHD stimulants. They all gave me horrible side effects and weren't always the most effective. I stopped taking medication for about 10 years because I didn't want to deal with it. Just recently started up again, and my current doctor recommended doing a Genomind test. It tests your DNA against a bunch of pharmaceuticals and will tell you if a drug is effective or not, if you're at high risk for side effects etc. It even checks to see if you metabolize drugs quickly. 

It was really eye opening for me, because it turns out, that all those stimulants I tried before, none of them were recommended for me based on the test. So now I'm on a regimen of 3 different non stims plus some supplements. With exercise and good diet, I'd say my ADHD is about 65% - 75% managed. It's still not great, but I'll take it. Highly recommended the test if you're able to do one!"

A lot of ot is being honest with yourself and being realistic with what youre capable of. If you know youre over extending yourself, tell your wife.

If Im already overwhlemed with tasks, I tell my partner I am and to not take ot personally. Its just about being proactive and constantly having a dialogue with yourself and checking in while also being honest. Ask yourself, if I say yes to that, am I really going to remember?

I'm in highschool and got recently diagnosed. On 10 grams of focalin. 

I'll miss school assignments, test dates, NAHS meetings, ARD dates. 

It's embarrassing to explain that I didn't bring the project because I forgot it was due when it's written on all three boards of the classroom in big red lettering

I've forgotten what class I was going to between class periods and gone to the wrong class during the SECOND semester. That's one of the most embarrassing moments of my life. ""You've had the same classes at the same times for 6 months and you're going to the wrong class?? What are you, stupid?"" 

I've experienced ADHD paralysis (or something similar) in the middle of assignments. Something about stopping in the middle of an AP chemistry quiz unable to move your hand to write as you turn the gears in your head to figure out this subject with so many other thoughts clogging up your mind doesn't seem very efficient. 

I've cried because I NEEDED to get up and walk around, to move, to do SOMETHING but I was too embarrassed and locked my joints to prevent me from getting up which only made me start crying. I just start tearing up in the middle of spanish class before being given permission to go to the nurse. (I didn't go, I just came back after stretching my legs) 

And in my opinion, the worst part for me personally when it comes to school (not including personal life, I'll get to that) is the fact that I cannot for the life of me remember formulas or times tables. It does not stick with me at all. And that makes my AP classes all the worse because we don't get formula charts or times tables or calculators. Geometry was a nightmare of cheating for formulas and begging for calculators (thank god my geometry teacher understood my issue after trying to teach me times tables in NINTH GRADE and failing) I could've done great on my own with those resources.

At home my mom is convinced im just lazy and constantly berates me for it. I can barely find and keep a hobby which upsets me greatly when I'm bored and nothing holds my attention. I'm an aspiring manga artist because im good at drawing that style but its hard to draw when I want to, much less when it's my job. 

And tasks are always complicated. If the instructions aren't clear and detailed I seem to ALWAYS do it wrong. People say I lack common sense when I just followed the directions given to me. 

""Hey, go wash the dishes in the sink""

- Okay

""Why didn't you wash the dishes on the counter and stove?""

- you didn't tell me to? 

""It should be common sense that if you're washing dishes you wash all of them""

- but you didn't say that

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"the stigma surrounding ADHD and the general populations misunderstanding of it, and the way it is treated, is miserable. 

I know that the post is tagged as empathy/support, but I am curious - did you titrate up and then back down to 20mg adderall or did doc just stick you on that dose and call it a day? your descriptions of your prior interactions with him sound like a similar experience to what I went through. Titration should really be the first thing you and your doctor work with when trying to work out ADHD medication and dosage and if he didn't do a titration and you feel it isn't working, you might just literally not be taking enough. **it is very possible that you simply optimize on a much higher dose than what you are taking**. I think especially for hyperactivity symptoms, higher doses tend to work better than what is needed to manage inattentive symptoms. Every single person responds to every single medication a little differently though, so its worth talking to doc about starting to **titrate dosage up to see if it helps, if you didn't already go through that process.** 

on a different note - even though I am currently in a good place with managing my ADHD on the day to day, I still find that oftentimes what hurts the most is not having a place to feel comfortable being me in. I am very large - 6'1"" and 220lb - and 99% of people I have ever known have an automatic fear reaction when I am upset over everything. Even my partner gets mad because I scare her when I am upset. I have never hurt a fly. never hit another person. I have never been violent in my life. When I am angry or stressed or sad, I have a tendancy to stomp around, slam a few doors, yell ""FUCK"" etc. It isn't directed at anyone or anything - but it is sometimes an unconscious behavior and sometimes I don't want to act that way but struggle to control it. I get especially frustrated because when my 5'4"" 120lb partner is pissed off and slams doors, huffs and puffs, whatever, nobody gets scared. my/her parents will think its funny, ask whats wrong, say ""haha, someones having a bad day"" but if I behave the same way everyone locks themselves in their rooms or gets all scared and concerned as if I my behaviour indicates that I'm any more dangerous in that state than she is. I am not. I just need to be pissed sometimes?? apparently im not allowed to be though.  

It seriously sucks because I'm not hurting anyone and sometimes I just really need that? I can't be on my medication all the time and for whatever reason, shouting the f-word and slamming a few doors seems to me like a better way to cope with my problems than drinking/MJ, yelling at my wife, fighting with people, hurting others, falling into a depressive spiral, venting/self loathing, etc. but this behavior is disruptive and scary and as such, I am simply expected to be different. 

I feel this way with a lot of things. Sometimes I just really need to be loud, need to slam something down in frustration, need to talk without interruption even if the other person isn't really listening and just decides to smile and nod. but nobody is okay with this or wants to deal with it so it can be really hard to find an outlet. When managing my symptoms I don't want to ""be better"" for other people, i want to be better for myself, and for my behavior that isn't harmful to myself or others, I wish that I could simply be accepted for who I am. unfortunately most people aren't willing to create or deal with that kind of an environment. 

point in this being - the way that I cope with this part of my adhd is to find a place to be me. I am very fortunate to have found a medication and dosage (concerta 36mg) that I respond well to, and which allows me to be different and function a little better during the times when I need to function well. I think that maybe this would be the first step for you if you haven't already gone through strategies to do so with your doctor. However, medication is not an end all be all solution, and coping with the sometimes more embarrassing parts of ADHD is and was, for me at least, a matter of finding people and places where it's okay for me to behave in ways that would be ""embarrassing"" in other situations. 

**TL,DR;** sometimes, no matter how embarrassing, you have to be you. while I find that my medication, therapy, and other strategies are very useful tools in managing my symptoms, **no amount of medication or masking will provide the accepting and liberating experience of finding a person and a place where you can be you without needing to worry about your behavior for a little while.**"

I hate the trend of “ADHD/autistic people when___” popping up on my instagram. Like, I get the want and benefit of community and support (oh hey look a subreddit) but reducing everything you do and think and say and are to constant cycle of simple quirky memes just ain’t it.

And don’t get me started on the med shortage. I take and hate adderall, more so when I get a letter from the warehouse sending a 3 month supply saying “No XR’s in, sowwy :(“"

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"this isn't really anything new, i remember 10 years ago there was shit on instagram and kids at my school talking about how quirky it is to have adhd. it was that and a lotta people that just thought adhd was made up and u just gotta stop being lazy and pull yourself up by your bootstraps or some shit"
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Im relatively new to adhd and stuff, so sorry if I say anything incorrect/insensitive or anything like that.
I completely understand what you mean. I got diagnosed about a week ago (took about 6 months), in part thanks to seeing a ton of relatable tiktoks with #adhd at the bottom which made me realise I probably had adhd or autism (I started suspecting 1.5+ years ago). A lot of them were about things like ahdh paralysis/executive dysfunction, switching tasks midway through and not going back to finish the first one, constantly forgetting things,...
So there are some good contentcreators who help spread awareness.
That said: the ones that try to make adhd sound like a ""fun quirky thing"" can bugger off :).
There are definitely some positives imo such as having like infinite interests, pattern recognition,... But it's not all fun and games."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"It's so hard for me because I've been growing up through these diagnosis trend cycles

When I was in High School, (2015-2020) the ""cool thing on the block"" was to have depression and/or anxiety, and my mum was unsure about me having it because every other teen on the internet supposedly did.

Now I'm 20 and realised in the last few years that I was possibly Audhd and just recently recieved my diagnosis a few months ago, but god in the lead up to getting tested my family thought I was following those trend cycles again and it was so mortifying and made me doubt myself so much despite the fact it was so obvious"
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I've seen and heard of people faking having ADHD and or tourettes. And they're making stupid videos they think are funny or cute when they don't realize that NO it's not. Do you think it's fun? Try having both. It fucking sucks. The constant nagging yourself for saying something stupid that you shouldn't have said, the worry that you're going to say something stupid. Ticking randomly and not even knowing you're doing it until someone tells you that you're annoying the shit out of them. I hate having adhd and tourettes. It's a shitty combo that's has very little benefits and little to no reward. I wouldn't want to change who I am don't get me wrong, but if I could snap my fingers and instantly almost full if not full control over my adhd and tourettes I would. Because it's hard to control and it takes forever to learn. 
I'm going to add that at a young age, I was way to hyper and unfocused. I didn't listen for shit and I pissed alot of people off. When my parents took me to the doctor you know what the doctor told them? Straight up said I was showing signs of sociopathy and I would probably be in jail or prison before I hit the ripe age of 18. I've gotten some control over it, but it still is one of the hardest things in my life to deal with."

It took me months after being suggested by a therapist to see a doctor about it. The hype put me off, I didn’t want to be just another person following a trend, the more I looked into it, the more my life started to make sense.

I find it really hard to explain anything about adhd while subconsciously knowing all about it. I hate being put on the spot about it because I’m really trying to pick things out but I can’t tell if they are mocking me or if I’m having peas and carrots tonight. I honestly feel like I’m trapped inside my own head, months go by where I’m just in a certain state where I don’t function. One day, I’ll wake up and I’ll take on the world and start to progress in life and as soon as I start to get bored, the thoughts and stress build up and leads to a meltdown. 

I don’t even know if this makes sense because I forgot what the whole post is about but yeah, adhd sucks and if you genuinely had it, you wouldn’t want it.

I want to get checked out for learning disabilities and adhd, but even as an adult where to start, what to believe and who to trust is tough."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"It’s exhausting. I wasn’t diagnosed until my sophomore year of college (2020) and it feels like nobody respects that it’s actually something has significantly impacted me; other ADHDers act like I just hopped on a train and shopped for a diagnosis, while non-ADHD people think I’m so “lucky” because they ~swear!~ they have it too but they “for some reason” can’t get a diagnosis.
Growing up I tried to open up to my mom about how I was struggling; she got mad when I forgot things, or was late, or didn’t get perfect grades, but she wouldn’t acknowledge how I was struggling. When I was old enough to know what ADHD was and I understood that it was possible I had it (esp. considering 2/4 other people in my family do) I told her I wanted to be evaluated for it. She said there was no way I had it, because my father and older brother both have it and they “act completely differently.” Spoiler: it’s because they’re more hyperactive while I’m more inattentive, and people also just think women can’t have ADHD. 
I was only finally diagnosed when I had the freedom to seek out a psychiatrist on my own. I was seeing her for anxiety but after a few appointments of hearing my symptoms and knowing my family history, she was the one who brought up the possibility of ADHD. It was such a relief to finally be acknowledged. 
I just wish that the disregard people had for how it impacts me would have stopped there. Despite my diagnosis, my mom still swears there’s no way I could have it, and so many of my peers just don’t understand and totally trivialize it. 
It feels like a losing battle from every angle."

But… I do agree there feels like a huge stigma about it and how “oh everyone struggles with that” and I think it’s because some creators just pick the most face value/surface level traits or issues and make it seem like that is what adhd is, when in reality it’s so much more than that and a lot more debilitating"

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I agree! You are spot on. It’s not helpful when accounts mention little things like “if you’re forgetful you might have adhd”. This isn’t something that should be relatable to the majority of the population. It really dismisses the problems people who actually have adhd face by acting like about everyone has some adhd nowadays. As you said, it’s not some quirky personality or something cute. It’s a real issue. And sometimes it looks like hyper focusing and forgetting to eat, struggling so hard to follow simple instructions, putting off tasks and then getting very overwhelmed, just having an overall hard time sticking to a schedule, and like you mentioned inability to sit still, and more."

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Thanks for being so candid and honest. First, I hear you, and I'm rooting for you. I hope you're hanging in there.

After my diagnosis, my psychiatrist and I discussed my paying for this saliva test that helps assess your specific chemistry when it comes to considering medications. The test doesn't diagnose you. But it gives your doc insights into what is likely to work if you're diagnosed with ADHD, depression, etc. If I hadn't done the test, I know my journey with medications would have been a lot more frustrating. 

I thought I'd mention it because I hear your frustration. I realize that meds aren't a magic bullet, but they have made a big difference when combined with the shit ton of other habits and tools I adopted before my diagnosis.

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Look, I was able to get a diagnosis because of these videos. I would drive into town for appointments and completely forget the appointment I had driven into town for ALL THE TIME. I thought everyone was consistently late for everything. I thought everyone had days where they laid in bed clenching their jaw and just couldn't do anything because they just felt STUCK. I legit thought these were normal things. I thought everyone had to know the plot to every movie they watched before they watched it and then excessively researched every topic brought up in said movie. I didn't understand how people could stand to not read in entire book in one sitting and find myself NOT finishing a book if I didn't finish it in one sitting. Like I could go on and on and on about the weird fuckkng shit I've been doing my ENTIRE life that I thought everyone did. As a woman, ADHD wasn't really a thing for us growing up in the 90's and 00's. Like no wonder I struggled so much in school, even though I was smart enough to get good grades. I can't even imagine how much better school would have been for me had a known earlier. Rag on the videos and the ""hype"" all you want. It's taken seriously for ME now and I am thankful for it."

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I can relate so hard to this post, when I went to the public psychiatrist in Norway I was told that I was just lazy and was bad at making decisions in my life. I told her this was insanely difficult for me and it was almost like a mental wall holding me back. At this point in my life I was nearly dropping out of high school and in a state of depression. To study I would need huge amount of caffeine or the use of stimulants (which were expensive). Was even sent to another ""ADHD Specialist"" in Norway and was told that as I had no symptoms as a child I could not be diagnosed. And it was difficult to diagnose since I was having difficulty with depression and that it couldn't be distinguished from ADHD. Was basically belittled and told I was incompetent. Meanwhile I've fully learned how to replace a head gasket on a volvo (finished mostly but didnt finish the last part like finding oil leaks and replacing gas tank, as I've had no motivation even though I've wanted to finish it)  


After one appointment with a more expensive psychiatrist in Brazil, I was diagnosed with ADHD and am now put on medication. Although I feel a bit of imposter syndrome, the diagnosis makes sense as I've had other friends with ADHD telling me I've most likely had it / called autistic growing up. I'm now coming back to Norway and am looking forward to do my last subjects as they were split since I had been gone for so long. Will need to retake some exams too but am finally looking forward to the spark in life again, with the motivation to become an engineer and study"

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Yeah I’m conflicted cuz the only reason I realized I had adhd was because so many of these made sense.

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I second this. Back when I got diagnosed at 8, adhd was not understood properly, neither by school nor by my psychologist. I love that people seem to have a better understanding of it nowadays, but at the same time it is very frustrating to see all these online trends saying 'everyone has adhd'. I felt so horrible and wrong for having it. Furthermore, I was put in 'special classes' which completely alienated me from my peers, making them think I was some mentally unstable child, all the while my biggest dream was to just 'be normal' and fit in. Instead I was bullied and looked down upon.

15% of people with adhd have a substance abuse disorder.

Even still, creating all of these routines is a messy process, the concept that my life needs to be scripted in a repetitive book (work, adult life, responsibilities, finance, my own health) is the complete opposite to my instincts, 

you can go too far in one direction and hyperfocus on the distraction right before the task 

But for me, I noticed how blind the disorder has made me at times - I am noticing objects now that I completed filtered to my unconscious mind as they weren’t “relevant”, I am mostly calm, even when fatigued, I feel far more in control of my own brain, I’m now aware that I’m quite a smart person, my thinking is just too fast for my own good sometimes, it is now structured, and more resilient 

all the self learnings I have gone through solidified at once, I’m now a little too hyped up with intensive energy and need to learn how to harness it

I cannot sleep the night before a plane flight, even if it’s not until the afternoon the next day. I’m so afraid I will not wake up to my alarm even though I know I’m a light sleeper. I think that was a key sign of oncoming ADHD, but the psychologist missed it. 

I’ve learned in the 10 years since how to deal without medication, but it’s hard, and I feel like I have ruined a ton of relationships due to my mood swings and outbursts of emotions that to me, are meaningless, but to others they think I’m going off the deep end or something. I hate it."

I swear, this shouldn't even be a thing. I understand that you may suspect you have ADHD, you can do that no problem, but unless you're profesionally diagnosed you shouldn't claim you have it."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"As a child I was taught the joy of books. I would become hyperfixated on books, to the point where I wouldn't sleep, would read while eating one handed, so on. This classed me as gifted. (Also I am female and ADHD and autism in female patients was and still is often overlooked)

It took me until my early twenties to get a diagnosis and finally feel like I wasn't just a failure"
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,This. There are downsides to disorders being widely discussed but it's helping people actually learn about themselves as well
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"man… this actually made me cry. i hate being so fucking misunderstood and scoffed at and dismissed. having a brain that literally doesn’t function properly wasn’t my choice and i bust my ass SO fucking hard to try to be normal, i feel like i work twice as hard as everyone around me and i still fail.

oh, and the medication “shortage” (bullshit fucking quota) that made me unable to fill my prescription for months on end helped cost me my job of 6 fucking years.

i don’t have the “forgetting to lock the door” kind of ADHD, i have the “nearly hitting pedestrians with my car and accidentally sticking my hand down the garbage disposal and suicial insanity” type of ADHD.

FUCK. every time i think of this shit my blood absolutely boils. all the missed opportunities and failures and disappointments and struggles make me so fucking sad."

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,YES! I 100% agree with this! I feel like social media is making these disorders almost mainstream? And whilst it's great people feel they can talk openly without stigma it's almost creating a bigger issue of self diagnosis and making those who actually have gone through a medical diagnosis process feel less valid.
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"It r reminds me of that vine where someone sees a meme and goes ""haha I do that"" cause that's exactly my reaction to a lot of ADHD videos. I'm like ""oh that's related to ADHD? I thought that was just a me thing"""
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"This is how I feel. Filler people eat up so much space for every subject, there's no avoiding it.  I'm grateful that so many ADHD and Autism tiktoks are sharing the real side. 

I'm officially diagnosed ADHD so I guess I'm allowed past the gate.

I'm late 40s, well educated, but never had an explanation for why I've struggled with *everything* my whole life (outside of good grades). It took having two kids who don't even present the same as me to look into it. If my oldest didn't have combination ADHD with the external hyperactivity I still think I'd be in the dark.

For my age, inattentive ADHD, especially in girls with good grades did not exist. ADHD and Autism were cartoonishly represented.

Just being able to give myself some grace instead of constant shame and self loathing is worth it. I still do, but maybe a little less and I don't let others knock me down as much. And more importantly I'm working on helping my kids understand themselves like I never had a chance to.

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"This  is me too, but interesting that I see the TikTok memes as similar to my childhood mental-health denying environment it that they seem to trivialize it at something everyone has. So, the mental health denial I experienced was ""oh, that's just normal to not sleep (like from infancy)"" or ""everyone is different, you're just different"". Leading to a lifetime of coping, burnouts, breakdowns, meltdowns, chaos, etc. But wondering how people actually get sh\*t done. I mostly kept it together until I had a full time office job I've been like ""I have no clue how people manage to work and do ANYTHING else"". And, I'd say this to people who would respond by looking at me like I was from another planet as though it was possible or even ""easy"" to do this. I don't get this sense of actually seeing or describing the real impairments that come with ADHD. It was only once I started reading ACTUAL scientific descriptions of ADHD that it started to click, because I just don't identify with someone that ""loses their keys"" or whatever. That does not actually describe what is happening inside my messy, messy brain. So, yeah, the social media descriptions just have the same feel as ""oh that's just a normal thing, isn't that different"" that I got my whole life. Which is to say I worry that it might not actually prompt people with more moderate or severe ADHD to get tested - I needed to understand in more detail what it actually might feel like."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"This is 100% me. I'm glad for the awareness because I would have never suspected it. I thought all ADHD was hyper active, and I only get little spurts of hyperness based on stimulus... But inattentive... 100%."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,That is very different than letting tiktok convince you that you have adhd because you like a certain color.
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I feel the same way. I was embarrassed for a long time I have it because of the stigmatism associated with it. So as I got older I started to view it as us not filtering so much stimuli all at once instead of “you’re missing a part of your brain”, or “you are deficient” because that makes me embarrassed/ ashamed."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"It’s a mixture of both honestly. When I was younger (about 7 or 8) my mom had me tested and she found out I had ADD. She didn’t believe in using medication to treat it, and I was so young I really didn’t know anything better and just went with it. She told me when I was older she didn’t need medications so she never bothered to help me with it. She still believes that to this day anytime she brings up “how my meds are going” because she still thinks this is something I’ll just grow out of at 30 years old. 

My TikTok FYP doesn’t really get flooded with ADHD content. It’s not that much at all actually and I usually only see a few videos a day on it. However, the videos I do see are always centralized in the same concept of “Here three reasons why you might have ADHD” and they have no credentialing to support their data. They list highly mundane activities that are mostly normal to the average person, or are completely inaccurate in what they describe. For example, a lot of them will talk about how organized they are. Organization is great! Is that the primary reason someone has ADHD? Not at all. Being organized is important for people who do have ADHD in the sense that, like me, if I don’t make lists or keep myself organized for chores or daily activities, I’ll be lost and it’s impossible to get on track again. But just saying “I like being organized” doesn’t mean you have ADHD. Then you see the comments are all “wow I had no idea I had ADHD, I’ve been very organized my whole life” and this starts the trend of misinformation. 

This post wasn’t meant to attack people for spreading information. It’s the spread of misinformation from people who use their ADHD for clout, or are trying to use their platform to diagnose people who aren’t licensed to do so. And then it makes people who actually do struggle with ADHD come off as if their issue isn’t real. Specifically why I said my coworkers tell me I’m autistic and just laugh. It’s hurtful and aggravating."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,Are you really questioning the validity of people who manage to get a psychiatrist to prescribe to them? That's really different than what the OP is talking about.
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"No gatekeeping in this post at all. If you believe you have a disorder, you should consult a medical professional what I disagree with is those who find a minor inconvenience in their daily life that they want to assume is a form of either autism or having ADHD, and not the fact that maybe they just forgot to do something one day. 

Furthermore, non licensed laypeople on any social media platform should not be providing information to the public persuading them they have any sort of disorder. If people want to cope, they cope however they find is necessary. If someone shares information stating they have a degree of some kind and the information is valid, that’s different. This post is regarding the accounts who discuss their ADHD for clout, views, and provide false information in the process. It’s truly disheartening to see people discuss their ADHD in a way that is not actually ADHD and is instead something completely unrelated. 

Yes there’s useful information available almost anywhere to the public, but there’s also TONS of accounts created just to spread false awareness on what ADHD is. And this isn’t specific to ADHD; this goes for other neurological disorders and how it’s glorified to the point where it comes off the wrong way. That’s all this post is about. Not gatekeeping any information here. I want those who need help to get help, not turn it into a fashion statement.

ETA: I also work in an emergency department and see this for too often in the workplace. Most of the time when people come in with their diagnosis, it comes from a TikTok that is not accurate to the diagnosis they were hoping to receive. Some people that have had a headache for two days claim it’s a brain injury and demand to be seen sooner than others. Their source is usually either TikTok or a blog post written by a non licensed professional. We run tests, scans, and find nothing. We usually don’t see them again and if we do, they come back with a different issue unrelated to the previous one with the same sources that misled them in the first place."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,THIS
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I feel this. My wife tells me I need to stop moving around in our bed at night because I can’t hold my feet still, and if I force myself to hold still, it physically pains me and I can’t help it. It’s like an itch I can get to. Anytime we go out and I feel like I “disconnect” from what we’re doing, she assumes I’m mad about something when really I’m fighting to maintain my composure in a public setting and it’s difficult. 

I like what you said about saying something or else you’ll forget it. My dad always talks over me and it happens quite often to where I’m saying something over and over until my statement is heard, because once that moment passes that thought is gone forever. Overall I agree with you and I think people only assume ADHD consists of a few things when it’s really beyond all the common “signs and symptoms” one thinks of when they hear about it."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"You’re absolutely right. I’ve been diagnosed for over 15 years. I am so tired of these wannabe drug addicts making it difficult for myself and others who actually need it to get medication.

I see so many stories in here from people who say “I’m actually very organized”, “I did well in school”, “I didn’t realize I have adhd until after I got my PhD lol”. Uh… you don’t have it. Sorry but if you can get a PhD, then what do you need medication for? Then they try to gas light me by saying it’s a spectrum even though that’s not in the DSM."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Lol ""hyperfocus"" was the main reason I was open to the idea I might have it. I thought of it as a superpower - called it my ""turbo mode"" - I could work like 16 hour days for weeks on end, but my entire life would fall apart while I was kicking ass at a project. Then I'd barely function at all for a month after. When I learned that my turbo mode looks exactly like ADHD hyperfocus, it got my attention. I miss that ability to go turbo, but as I got older the cost of it was so clear that I now recognize it as a bad thing."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I originally thought of my hyperfocus that way too... because my memory is so shit and I'm not self aware at all, so I'd celebrate how amazing it was that I could clean the whole house within 1 hour.... completely fucking ignoring the fact it had been in a terrible mess for 2 weeks."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,I was diagnosed as a kid but my parents stopped having me take Ritalin after 2 years without explaining why so i figured i didn’t actually have it. Then I realized I do recently after talking to my doctor and it’s such an akward timing…
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I believe it is both overdiagnosed *and* underdiagnosed, depending on where you are and what demographic you're part of. Research in my own country show this at least. Boys are over diagnosed with the hyperactivity version but underdiagnosed with the inattentive version. Girls are generally underdiagnosed in both. 

My theory is that the increase in diagnosing ADHD right now, is mainly because of all the adults who went undiagnosed their whole lives and now are made aware. The increased focus on women's health, have brought the lesser noticed ""versions"" of ADHD, OCD, autism etc into the light, for both sexes. All those who previously were just ""chronically depressed"" or had anxiety for some rather unknown reason, have now gotten a lot of help and inspiration to fight more for their case and actually figure out what is wrong, instead of getting a ""pathological"" diagnosis, that is ""We have figured out that you are struggling but we haven't a clue why""."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,It’s under diagnosed for women though.
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,Same. I wish people with ADHD would realise that a) tiktok is an absolute trap for people like us and b) tiktok is not real life. If you keep consuming media that makes ADHD sound ~quirky and silly then yeah that's gonna colour how you feel about yourself. You CAN curate your social media feed. I consume content related to my hobbies and things that inspire me. I block stuff that makes me feel crap. And I try not to give a fuck about what other people think about ADHD. I am open about it because I'm not ashamed. And being open about it helps other people.
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,It’s not a spectrum. Check the DSM.
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,its the teenagers that really absorb this crap
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,The rule is to not encourage self-diagnosis. Having respect for one another is something that we should do as a community. People on their journey towards a diagnosis often self-identify with ADHD before seeking professional help; those folks deserve the same respect as everyone else. We should respect everyone and encourage everyone to seek a professional for a proper diagnosis.
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Absolutely agree. I don’t know everyone’s story and can’t jump to conclusions on everyone based on a 30 second video. It’s the ones that don’t support their evidence with factual data and come off as more of a “trust me I know what I’m talking about” that get to me. If someone makes a TikTok that is meant to “diagnose” others, at least provide information that is truth to the diagnosis and not information that they just believe is true. 

In part I feel like these people are almost excited to be diagnosed with it and that’s what gets me. This isn’t anything to be excited about and I don’t understand why it’s being glorified lately in this manner."

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Well, depends. I wouldn't so readily disregard the struggles of some to get diagnosed when they very well may have it. Gotta take it on a case by case basis. Sure, also likely they may have other conditions that present like ADHD, but as long as they aren't taking the situation lightly and trying to get diagnosed just because of a trend, I'd side with them."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"My theory is that tech/social media *is* impacting general population’s attentional processing, people are noticing, and then identifying with ADHD because it uses some of the same descriptors. Not realizing that actual, diagnostic ADHD is not just a short attention span from too much tiktok.

Same thing happening with other disorders. Someone feels depressed for a few days and for good reason, identify with major depressive disorder, which has criteria of months of sustained depression. Or mild neurotic traits identified with OCD.

There’s overlap between the language that describes the traits and which describes the true disorders, but that overlap does not account for the stark contrasts.

We need quality mental health education in schools, and it’s just not happening. Most teachers wouldn’t even be able to teach the nuances."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Same! I was watching those ADHD tiktoks for like 2 or 3 weeks like, surely everybody identifies with all of these right?? Talked to some friends, nope. So I'm in grad school, and my anxiety was really starting to push me over a ledge. Made an appointment with a therapist, and I did not even mention anything about ADHD, and within 15 minutes of our first appointment she told me she suspects I have ADHD and working on strategies to manage it will give me the most help. So honestly, I can't be mad at the content out there because it helped me identify my ADHD and get help."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Yes...but there's a difference between a psychiatrist saying you don't have ADHD, and them refusing to even evaluate ANYONE for it.

I ran into the 2nd type, and I called 15 different shrinks in my area and NOBODY would give me (or anyone else) an evaluation.

I think that should be illegal.  What would the AMA say about kidney specialists suddenly deciding they won't evaluate people for kidney stones?  They know it's a real thing, that people suffer greatly because of it, there is treatment available that can be life-changing, but they refuse to help.

Fuck those shrinks.

EDIT: Changed a word"
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Same with me. My mom once said in my teenage years that ""ADHD is a comorbidity that occurs with autism"" and so I never thought of analyzing the symptoms. 5 years later I had a wake up call from all the situations, saw these symptoms and most of them matched, they existed in me as far as I can remember in my life. Got an uncle of mine to diagnose me (he's a psychiatrist, lives in another country, so I just called him up one day and asked ""what if it's true"") and it turned out to be real.

The day my mom knew it, she was broken as she couldn't understand how to get rid of it. The day I got to know was when I realized how I wasn't the mistake here, and how it's all something not so under my control, I couldn't believe how much lighter I felt that day.

But to get an official diagnosis to start medication, I had to do the same process, counseling services, PCP, psychiatrist. The first one literally said on a video call that ""well I don't see any symptoms when I see you, which can be described as ADHD, so I'm going to ask you to pay for a test I'll be giving, we can then continue the discussion"". Searched for another one who then did that in a couple of minutes that I met them and agreed to start with medication. 

> Like I’ve seen people be like “I went to 3 different psychiatrists and all of them wouldn’t diagnose me” like then maybe you don’t have adhd??

And I think most people don't realize this, but there are many other disorders that mimic ADHD, like bipolar. Impulsivity, depression and hypomania, with frequent concentration issues, that's basically the same symptom set. Some have both of them. Bipolar is generally ignored and never given the benefit of doubt because it sounds scary and people want this cool ADHD tag, like srsly what??"
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Same situation on realizing huh, a lot of these things hit home for me. I already have a psychiatrist for other reasons, so I brought it up with him, expecting a full evaluation, or at least a discussion about why I think that. Instead he just said ""okay, let's try you on this med first."" I'm so confused - did he just already agree with me from working with me, and it was one of those things he already knew but didn't bring up until I brought up my impaired functioning? Do I have an actual diagnosis now or not? The most confusing part of all of it is that earlier in the visit, he made an offhand remark (not related to me) about it being frustrating when his patients google stuff and self diagnose. Then I ask for an evaluation and he just hands me meds immediately? So strange."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,">. Like I’ve seen people be like “I went to 3 different psychiatrists and all of them wouldn’t diagnose me” like then maybe you don’t have adhd??

Doctors did not consider how ADHD affects people who aren't prepubescent white boys until recently and a lot of doctors are still very uninformed and go by outdated information.  Every Psychologist who's expertise is ADHD I've seen has said that the name is misleading and the symptoms listed in the DSM are very limited and lack nuance. 

Every other day you see a post of someone getting denied a diagnosis for dumb reasons (because they did well in school, they're not fidgety, I saw one person say their doctor said they couldn't have ADHD because they had a job?), people getting denied meds they've been taking for years once they switch doctors, sometimes even the SAME doctor will do this shit, or now how since we are in a shortage we have a million stories about how people feel judged when looking for the meds they were prescribed.

My doctors would just straight up change the subject and refused even evaluate me or refer me somewhere. Like yeah the Tiktokers are annoying but at the end of the day ADHD was never taken seriously it's just a different font now, instead of ADHD being the ""boys will be boys disorder"" it's now a ""tiktok attention seeking disorder"".

I feel like this sub sometimes underestimates just how unreliable the medical community can be for people with ADHD, the reason why there's so much misinformation today is that a lot of people just don't have support outside of online because doctors don't give a fuck. They don't know what it looks like adults, and I think a lot of them lowkey just don't believe its real. The stigma is really bad."

When I tried to get registered there first and was asking around about doctors specialising in learning diabilities the receptionist told me that learning disabilities are for students and adults just have to work.

Most studies have been done on males and the hyperactivity in males over females is definitely prevalent."

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"> For my age, inattentive ADHD, especially in girls with good grades did not exist. ADHD and Autism were cartoonishly represented.

Yeah I was a kid in the 80s-90s too... ADD was the diagnosis for the bounce-off-the-wall-fidgety-kid. I was, and mostly am, though i think it's dulled a bit, bright. And desperate for my parents' acceptance and the validation of being the best in my class so i did very well in elementary school and then in grade 12 i really nosedived. Still got into college."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I did well I school as a kid but once I got college I wasn’t able to maintain anymore. I tended to hyperfocus a lot on reading and things video games or new skills I wanted to learn as a kid I think that along with masking and my family being the way it was is why I went undiagnosed although the school tried to tell my mom and she wouldn’t listen. I can understand what you mean about being able to give yourself some grace, the good ole hyper criticality of self has definitely caused me to beat myself up a lot over the years I could never understand why I was so initially focused and hyped and then after a period of time was unmotivated in a hobby,career,interests etc or why simple shit like good teeth-brushing habits were so hard for me. I’ve spent 30+ years kicking my own ass and telling myself your just not trying hard enough if you do your best you can do it just try harder till it’s just about broken me. It’s when I got to this point I realized that something’s wrong and always has been but I was unaware. Having a diagnosis so there’s a reason and for me an understanding of why I’m the way I am in and of itself would be a huge relief. I have horrible social anxiety so being able to discuss my issues more comfortably on these subreddits has really helped me gain a better understanding and perspective as well as put together what I want to talk with the doctor about. Much appreciation to you all and I wish you luck in your journeys as well."

I love that you point out how gatekeepy this post sounds to anyone seeking diagnosis based on information found on social media

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,I can relate I had a very simplified understanding of ADHD before and as I learned more about it I realized a lot of the symptoms describe the way I am and my life since I was kid. Today is the last day before my doctors appointment and it’s all I can do to be at work today. I can’t stop thinking about my appointment and wondering/worrying about how it’s going to go.
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,That’s a fair a point after re-reading the post it makes more sense to me know.
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I do think creators online have a responsibility to recognize that their audiences, especially on TikTok, are primarily young people who are easily influenced. Especially if they have a large platform. Certainly it's not acceptable to present a short list of ""possibly"" ADHD traits in your video and assert that people DEFINITELY have ADHD if they experience them. Sometimes you can tell someone is not trying to be helpful, but just trying to generate more attention and clout.

But if medical professionals fail to take me seriously because people are spreading misinformation about ADHD online, I really just interpret it as a failure on the medical professional's part. It's absolutely infuriating that a person who spent an absurd amount of time and money to get through an education so they could diagnose and treat ADHD (among other things) might think I'm lying about my experiences because of idiot kids on TikTok. That my care might be impacted because my doctor was influenced by fucking TikTok makes me want to scream, to be honest. And that's on the doctor, in my eyes.

Same with your coworkers, too. If they minimize your problems or fail to believe you just because of some idiots online, many of whom are teenagers or very young adults, that's really just a reflection of your coworkers. That's not to say I don't understand the frustration, though. But I think the majority of these people genuinely think they have ADHD, and they're so used to recording and uploading everything about their life, but never stopped to consider that what they're doing could have real consequences.

On another note though, have you really noticed no change at all while on these medications? Not even slight clarity, or fewer concurrent trains of thought? That's really interesting, but I hope you find something that works for you soon!"
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"It's strange that our experiences are so different, considering tiktoks algorithm is very specific it really pushes adhd content to me at the minute but I have seen maybe 1-2 people in dozens that I thought ""hmm this doesn't seem like adhd to me"". But like... I'm also not a professional is the diagnostic space and everyone's adhd presents differently.


Also, my psychiatrist said the dsm needs updating again to reflect some sort of comorbidities. While he couldn't use them in particular for the actual diagnostic criteria, he did tell me eating disorders, skin picking, overly self critical thoughts, and sensory overwhelm are extremely common in those with adhd. So if for example you see a tiktok talking about adhd and their disordered eating, someone without it might (correctly) think ""well that's not adhd"". Because it's not, on its own, but the DSM is so particular that many people might discount themselves, so it's a good baseline of other common symptoms (but not diagnostic criteria ones) to help people.



When you say, people who think they have a disorder should consult a medical professional, what that originally looked like to me was going to my GP, them googling a list in front of me, asking me 6 random DSM based questions that are very ablist and narrow questions in the first place, and saying I have a masters and don't fidget enough so I can't have it. It was only after enough exposure to seeing what common other issues among adhd people are, did I feel confident enough to advocate for myself and pay to go private, bypassing the need for my GP. And like... my psychiatrist also has adhd so it's not like education = no adhd. 



One common comorbidity probably doesn't mean jack shit, but when they continually add up and compound then yeah, you start to realise and do more research. Even without tiktok,the idea of doing your own research can be taboo to doctors, but i would not have been diagnosed without it, i would have just believed ""well they say i dont fidget so i guess im out, i guess im just shit/lazy that it seems so hard to do basic shit everyday"". Especially among women I do believe we don't have enough exposure, I don't care if there's a small bit of misinformation in there as well. Women are more likely to be missed in childhood and have longer time to develop comorbidities which compound and mask everything making it very hard to sort through. Random ass videos making light of things and showing things that aren't necessarily adhd on their own, but common to some people with adhd, can be very helpful."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Wow you can repeat what you’re thinking/wanting to say in your head while also listening and retaining what they’re saying? What a gift! I wish I could do that.. I can only focus & hold onto 1 thought at a time.

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Yep as a woman who was diagnosed at 34 after a lifetime of being given every antidepressant and anti anxiety medication under the sun, I personally think complaining about there being too much ""hype"" etc is male privilege... There are so many of us that NEED to see a lot of representation of what this shit looks like in women,and especially audhd women because some elements mask each other"
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Yeah claiming it's ""over diagnosed"" makes me uneasy because there is recent research that has led to a correction in generations that went under diagnosed. A ton of people are getting diagnosed who should have been decades ago. The more recent understandings also show that it doesn't manifest the same way in everyone (that people who do well in school or at work, or who can keep down and organized can easily have it). The pandemic put all these people's coping mechanisms and masking skills to the test, too. I did ok without medication until I didn't."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Yes this. I have had several different diagnoses over my adult life (anxiety, depression, dysthymia etc). Finally halfway through the ADHD diagnostic process at 43 years old.

Not uncommon for women to be refused a referral or have diagnosis denied by inadequately informed or old fashioned GPs and psychiatrists.

Also going through the autism diagnostic process by a clinic that specialises in diagnosing women."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,Yep I agree with everything you said!
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,@RubyHamster said it better than I even could.
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"It is a spectrum in the sense we can have different types, different primary symptoms, varying degrees of those symptoms, and different display of those symptoms.

""A spectrum disorder is a mental disorder that includes a range of linked conditions, sometimes also extending to include singular symptoms and traits. The different elements of a spectrum either have a similar appearance or are thought to be caused by the same underlying mechanism. In either case, a spectrum approach is taken because there appears to be ""not a unitary disorder but rather a syndrome composed of subgroups"". The spectrum may represent a range of severity, comprising relatively ""severe"" mental disorders through to relatively ""mild and nonclinical deficits"".[1]"" (Wikipedia https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_disorder)

Plus the DSM is a diagnostic TOOL. It doesnt show the reality in full ~ and experts in this field of research have stated as much. It needs another update already, even though they have been continually doing so because the research coming out has been completely shifting the view of ADHD (and other disorders). Like ASD, there is a similarity in the cause of the dysfunction in our brains BUT how that presents for people is VASTLY different. There is also not exactly a set ""cut-off"" in reality where we can define ADHD and non-ADHD - that is entirely an arbitrary standard set by the individual doctors interpreting the DSM."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Ah yes, that’s totally valid I see what you mean and I agree"
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"You can’t see how people can be excited that they now have a reason and name to put to their lifelong struggles? That they have a way to understand themselves better that isn’t just “well I guess I’m a lazy fuckup and it’s my own fault that I struggle in life”? I don’t like people treating any kind of neurological difference (ADHD, autism) as a “superpower”, but it was a fucking RELIEF to realize the reason I was struggling so much with school and holding my life together after high school wasn’t my fault and there were things I could do to help myself that were more likely to work for my brain.

When I finally reached out to someone to talk about diagnosis, he laughed in my face and said it wasn’t possible for me to have ADHD bc I “didn’t suffer enough during childhood from ADHD symptoms”, completely ignoring the things that were ignored bc I was sociable and always had good grades as a kid. Seeing lesser known symptoms of ADHD on social media and talking about how I related to those experiences with other people who were diagnosed with ADHD helped me immensely."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Yeah that’s problematic. I know a few articles on the bbc where journalists have lied their way through the questions and gotten an adhd diagnosis. 

I know those articles are coming from the point of view of ‘look how easy it is for your kids to make this stuff up’ and probably comes from a protective place but they also prove invalidating to so many people who have been suffering and have found comfort in the diagnosis or success through medication."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I've seen that too, from people who have a range of mental health problems no less. One woman complained that her doctor wanted to treat her anxiety and PTSD before looking at ADHD meds. Whole lot of randos were telling her to complain and that the doc was wrong, with zero medical knowledge or background info. Just outrage."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Whaaaat?!! Seriously?! Why would you want to lie to get a diagnosis of anything? To me, that's drug seeking behaviour, since if they don't have it, they don't need the meds, right?! It's also not something I personally like having. It can also mask another diagnosis these people could possibly have. 

I also think self diagnosis is troublesome for not only this reason (the tiktok reason) but also I know how it's changed my life being diagnosed and medicated. So, a professional should be involved imo, to firstly either confirm or deny the diagnosis, since a lot of the symptoms can be symptoms of other things as well, but to also come up with a treatment plan"

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Ikr, I wish there was a way online content and groups could somehow be official filtered.

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"As a tangent, my GP told me to exaggerate on my 6 question form to see whether or not a sleep test was required so we could get sleep apnea diagnosed. Granted, most of the questions were general questions about sleep, and my sleep is anything but general, but his words to exaggerate came in handy... Turns out I stop breathing 20 times a ***minute***. So thanks GP for telling me to exaggerate, otherwise i probably wouldn't have been able to get the sleep test 

But yes, in most cases do not lie or exaggerate. If you and your doctor actually believe you have it and exaggeration is needed, use it. Otherwise don't."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,How do you even fake those tests tho?? They pretty much set them up in a way that they’re difficult to fake
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"The tests are bullshit and not everyone is in a place where they can reasonably access care without learning how to navigate the gatekeeping.  Every doctor I talked to agreed that my symptoms make it likely I had ADHD, but when I first tried to get diagnosed the only place I could find that took my insurance used my ""good"" performance on *some* metrics of the test they used to deny me care and blame my symptoms on the fact that I'm transgender instead.

Obviously you should not lie about your symptoms, but the system is hostile to those not diagnosed in childhood and it makes sense to seek help in how to navigate it."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"This.

I was diagnosed with adhd 20 years or so ago. Maybe longer. No one seemed to think it was anything serious or worth treating so I didn't do anything about it. Fast forward to lockdown and way more social media time and I happened to run across adhd twitter. Suddenly there's an explanation for a lot of my struggles, and what do you know, it's even treatable! All that time and I had no idea. Now I'm on a waiting list to see a psychiatrist about it and that wouldn't have happened if not for adhd social media. 

Yes there's misinformation too. That's inevitable. But IMO it's still better than the blanket ignorance we had before."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"This. I have been misdiagnosed for years as Bipolar because as a kid, they thought I was too smart to have ADHD.

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"So the thing about ADHD is that while strategies to manage it help, none of those strategies will stick without first getting your brain on the same chemical playing field as the rest of humanity.

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"> them refusing to even evaluate ANYONE for it.

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Honestly this hits home, I am so frusturated because mental health is like ages behind in my country and even then all resources available are for like things like depression/anxiety etc which is great but also it is so so hard knowing that if I went to any psychiatrist (and it costs alot of money to go even), I would be rejected right away because a. I'm a woman and b. I'm an adult and surely I must not have adhd if I've lived ""fine"" so far right? 

I break down so many times because I feel so extremely crippled by my adhd and by my anxiety which skyrockets everytime my symptoms are particularly bad. I feel broken most of the time, like a shattered glass, wondering if I could ever even come close to normal. And all of this without even considering the fact that nobody, absolutely nobody, takes adhd seriously. Suddenly everyone has to throw their opinions about it and how it's just another name for ""laziness"" and what not. I stopped saying anything about adhd near my family because I know they'll never get it. I'm so so tired and I've given up on getting a diagnosis now so I guess I'll forever feel like an imposter among normal people and forever among adhders because I'll never know if it's all in my head and I'm being delusional or if I truly do have adhd."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Oh that's definitely a different case, and I'm really sorry you had to go through that. My university counselors acknowledged that I very much had all the symptoms, but they would not diagnose me with it. That started the whole thing. My PCP then said that I did have ADHD, I got referred to psychiatrists, got diagnosed. Then they wouldn't see me cuz I moved to a different state. By that time, my PCP had retired, and the search for another reliable psychiatrist who would treat ADHD was so difficult. I jumped between psychiatrists and meds so much that the withdrawal would send me into a mental breakdown every single time. I basically stopped taking meds lol until my school counseling center finally showed me another avenue. Def fuck those shrinks lol"

Yeah, I'm _fine_, but I'm not great. I haven't been able to grow to my full potential, and I know that because I had an IQ test done not that long after my misdiagnoses and apperently it was only slightly under my older sibling's test results. For context: my sibling's results were really high, sibling basically waltzed through highschool, got a master's degree and went for a phd. I on the other hand, I struggled through highschool, went 2 years to the same university as my sibling for a master's degree and after those two years switched to a more technical kind of university for a bachelor's, and even then it took me an extra year to finish. My sibling always wondered why I was struggling so much because I was about as smart as them. Untill my nibling's case happened, things got in the open and the pieces started to connect. (I wasn't told _anything_ about my true -mis- diagnoses or test results back then, so I couldn't compare with my sibling at the time, and my sibling didn't know I wasn't told anything, so assumed I didn't think it was important at the time.)"

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I really hate that, I hear it a lot. ADHD meds are *stimulants,* and there's some symptom overlap with both anxiety and depression. It's possible that you may have ADHD that is causing natural anxiety, rather than an anxiety disorder, in which case medicating the ADHD makes sense. But if there is any reasonable doubt, **and it’s possible you don’t have ADHD at all**, putting someone with a diagnosed anxiety disorder on a *central nervous system stimulant* is borderline malpractice. It's a terrible idea.

EDIT: bolding for emphasis. I'm not saying you shouldn't be medicated for ADHD if you have anxiety. I'm saying that if there's a possibility you *don't* have ADHD at all, but you *do* have anxiety, stimulants are likely to make your other problems way worse. So caution makes a lot of sense."

So he accused them (and me for agreeing with them) of being homophobic for not giving him stimulants that could absolutely make his anxiety worse. 

Having really bad anxiety issues myself that's controlled by both an anti-psychotic and a mood stabilizer (Seroquel & Lamictal), tried to explain that to him that even with the heavy combo of stuff I'm on, stimulants STILL can and will exacerbate said anxiety issues, but nope, I'm an asshole.

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,u replied to wrong comment
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Heyo, psych student w/adhd here. In psychopharm we learned quite a bit about nicotine and adderall. With folks like us, there tends to be a big shift towards both drinking and smoking, but for different reasons.

Smoking nicotine is easy to understand, it's a CNS (central nervous system) stimulant and promotes dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin just like adderall (except we also discovered it to be significantly more addictive). 

Whilst drinking tended to have a more social or societal reasoning (especially since alcohol is a CNS depressant, which would otherwise make issues with adhd worse if it weren't for the addition of the norepinephrine release that also comes from it).

Alcohol is seen as a socially acceptable way of hand waving all the downsides or perceived effects of adhd and the ability to ""unmask"" ones own symptoms under a veil of ""oh they're just drunk/buzzed"" which when said aloud is quite depressing. Folks with autism also tend to suffer with alcoholism as well due to this too.

prescription medications such as adderall tend to be a way of turning folks away from the addictiveness of nicotine, caffine, and alcohol. This is done with the aid of supervision by a doctor or clinician to observe the effects different medications have on the person with adhd's body. Some medications like ritalin and adderall run the risk of jacking up certain people's heart rate or causing too much dopamine to flow through the brain that they lose their appetite. Sometimes doctors shift towards SSRI'S to target specifically serotonin in an attempt to see if just raising one chemicals level will produce the desired effect while reducing the side effect burden.

Suffice to say, prescription drugs are far from perfect. And if you have a doctor that doesn't listen to you, tell you the interactions the drug has with other chemicals, or even asks about your current diet (spoiler: acidic foods and carbonated beverages shorten and dull the effects of adderall, ritalin, and many other CNS stimulants which may be the reason OP doesn't get any effect out of any of the drugs they have taken) Then it can be excruciatingly difficult to trust them. However, prescription drugs for adhd also tend to last a lot longer, and if tailored right to account for your own personal profile (genetics, other medications, doctor-patient communication) then they can end up garnering longer lasting relief with a lower chance of addiction, or even a better medication overall that actually tackles the pharmacokinetics/dynamics of the issues that are causing your adhd symptoms.

Hope this helps, and remember: always ask the doctor for the interactions, diet, and pharmacokinetics/dynamics of how the medication you are being prescribed will effect you. There are a lot of clinicians out there that will forget, neglect, or have never really understood/learned about the prescriptions that they are giving you (college tends to teach to remember connections, not explore concepts. Which tends to lead to bad diagnosis and treatments. But there really is no where else to go (at least in the U.S.)😥)."

The problem with diagnosis at a young age is that it's harder for kids to explain what going on in their head, and they don't notice that their behaviour is out of the ordinary so it needs to be caught by someone else.

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"When I was maybe idk 19 I was lucky enough to get a brain scan done by my childhood psychologist (the guy that diagnosed me when I was 9) for the price of a normal appointment because… I guess he just like, wanted to do it?  Idk how that works but he had the equipment so both me and my brother got one done.  

Even before the results were analyzed, with him just watching the screen, he was able to see abnormalities indicative of ADHD.

“wow, you definitely have ADHD!”

“Yep there’s the ADHD!”

“Wow, no wonder you can’t sleep!” 

The machine would also make a little ping every time I blinked… it was trippy.  

After the results were recorded and analyzed and put on a bunch of fancy colored charts the verdict was yes, ADHD, but a specific type of ADHD where I have excessive beta waves in the back of my brain (they are mainly supposed to be relegated to the front) (also it might have been the other way around idk but there were too many beta waves SOMEWHERE).  Another interesting tidbit, he told me that a colleague of his who had also reviewed the results pointed out a part of my brain and said “this person struggles with social skills.”  It was a part of my brain responsible for recognizing facial expressions or something.

Then after the testing I had to follow up with my therapist and PCP for more questions before they would start medication treatment. 

However I know a lot of people who have been diagnosed other ways, either through process of elimination where treatment for other potential diagnoses failed so they try ADHD treatment, or people whose doctors just ask them a few questions and then give them a diagnosis, and even some who are just given medication without the diagnosis. I’ve even been told by other doctors since my diagnosis that there is no formal testing for ADHD and the testing I did was fake or unnecessary. Obviously it wasn’t fake and there is formal ADHD testing, it just doesn’t appear to be as widely used. 

My testing was also very, very expensive even with insurance, and there’s a lot of insurances that won’t cover it so that might contribute to the differences in testing and diagnosing as well."

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Omg. This is exactly how my diagnosis went on.

One day I sat my boyfriend, crying, and told him « okay there is this big thing I need to do. I just *can’t* somehow. I can’t make this appointment. Because the reason I need this appointment is the reason why I somehow can’t make this appointment. And I have tried to since the last 6 years. I know I have it, but I can’t bring myself to do it. Help me. Call for me »

And this is how I was finally diagnosed lol

Everyday it is the same story. I can’t look at emails. Can’t answer texts, can’t make appt calls, can’t brush teeth, can’t go to sleep, can’t study. Cannot make it to work in time, unless someone is there to push me (him). I hate it. I hate that people take it so lightly. It is a true disability and if your life isn’t a disaster/living hell because of it, then maybe you don’t have it and you need to stop self diagnosing."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"The doctor who diagnosed me it was a 2 year thing... because I kept forgetting to make follow ups... and then that doctor I was working with wasn't there anymore. Cue to the 3rd doctor. I finally have all the paperwork from the first two. 

I explained why it took 11 months to get the paperwork back. ""So I filled it out immediately so I wouldn't forget it. Then I moved it. So I forgot about it. Then I was cleaning and found it! I moved it again like 'ok don't forget to send this back' and then I forgot that I had put it in a safe place. Then I was cleaning again. I get this itch to deep clean every few months and move everything around. I found it. My friend who is diagnosed with ADHD found the paperwork for them to to fill it out and gave it to me. 

So. I put it in my car. In the passenger seat. Had to get my blood drawn the next day and so I finally turned it in!""

Yeah diagnosed me on the spot. Second appointment. Talked to me maybe 20min between the two appointments.

I was immediately thrown to the clinical pharmacist and now on a regiment that works and I'm thriving."

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I’m in the same boat. I was on stimulants for the longest time, didn’t work/gave me bad anxiety.

I still get anxious, but it’s in no way as debilitating"

I *am* saying that it makes a lot of sense to be cautious about prescribing ADHD meds when anxiety is present and ADHD is *uncertain.* Stimulants seem to work a little different in the ADHD brain. If you definitely have anxiety, but you might *not* have ADHD, then prescribing stimulants could do a lot of harm."

Like having someone perform a cognitive task while exposed to attention-grabbing distractors

Could be that there's no test that distinguishes ADHD from non-ADHD well. There's a lot of overlap, since ADHD is just regular symptoms that get bumped up to the point where they cause problems.

A non-ADHD person might also be caught as a false positive because of stress, environmental factors, individual variation, so on, or it just marks everyone as having ADHD."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Yeah the brain activity is different for people with ADHD compared to those without. You can look it up online.

And that showed a difference between the brains of people who have ADHD and those who don't.

Apart from the chemicals in the brain not working the same I mentioned above, you can google ""adhd and prefrontal cortex"" and you'll get some info about the disregulation and how that affects the behavior, consentration and emotions regulation.

Starting a new job during Covid led to my later in life dx and seeking help and medications to navigate this stage in my journey. Not to depress you or anyone else reading this, but changes in hormones can increase/intensify your symptoms.

Had to remember colors of cars and houses, click on numbers when they pop up and so on.

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,Kinda similar here. I was on waiting lists for about 2 and half years after I went to my doc about it. He told me how long the NHS waiting lists were and gave me a referral to private healthcare and it still took ages. I got a phone call about an appointment eventually back in October and then finally got diagnosed about 6 months later. I'm currently still waiting on titration as well since the start of the year and I have no update when my first appointment might be for that stuff.

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Yep, pretty much. Far from the case with me too, things are very much not fine and even if you try they usually continue to be not fine most of the time.

None of these things were true before I got treated. I still struggle, but I'm not consumed by the struggle anymore."

So far, besides the the common side effects, i've experienced point 1 and 7. It's quite amazing how much better i am at following and partaking in verbal discussions and lectures. Are you suggesting that this aspect might improve even further with time?"
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"thanks, this is really helpful and reassuring to hear - that things can get better!

I was wondering if it helps with future planning at all? Like, I struggle to think beyond say 3-4 days away, so the longer term things I should be doing to lead to an overall better life, I don't do them because there's more immediate things to indulge in ><

if something is more than a week away, it might as well be a year away, and who's gonna worry about something that's 'a year' away hey :/

Ritalin at 9 months <3,"I’m a jerk. But I’m also hyper fixated on one of your statements because I’m in the middle of a bad spell this week, so yay me. 

If you have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia make sure to get a Lyme disease test. They often cross. 

My non-medical understanding is that fibromyalgia isn’t a specific thing- it’s doctors acknowledging there is a problem but not knowing what the problem actually is so they group it into fibromyalgia. So that means they haven’t figured out what is causing the issue for you and are treating just the symptoms. They can’t actually say “we don’t know what’s causing this but we give up- here, let’s make you more comfortable!”  But that’s what it means. 

Lots of fibromyalgia is actually Lyme disease, since Lyme disease presents all of those symptoms is what I was told. 

Sorry for the off topic ramble and I hope everyone has good health..also drive fast, take chances. 

Also also, adhd plus Lyme is like super adhd. It’s adding adhd symptoms into adhd symptoms. So that’s fun!"
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"I’m with you on #3. I’ve always been depressed, but taking Ritalin has significantly decreased that feeling. I  didn’t suddenly become a ray of sunshine, but I’m overall more optimistic than I was for most of my life. My generalized anxiety has pretty much disappeared while I’m on my medication. Of course, I still have some specific anxieties and phobias, but the constant feeling of dread is gone. Those changes have made me so much more confident as a human being. It’s amazing what the right treatment can do. 

Great post, OP."

Ritalin at 9 months <3,Can it indirectly increase your intelligence? I always got the feeling there is so much more but because my short term memory is trash and the fact I so easily overlook details in combination with my low frustration limits lets me fail on so many intellectual tasks.
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"Ok but !!! The fibromyalgia and pain thing!!!!! I’m on month two of ritalin and am starting trying Ritalin LA today. 

When I was waiting for diagnosis for ADHD someone on one of my fibromyalgia groups posted a study about how there was a suspected link between fibro and ADHD that they was starting to get looked into. And I thought “hey wait is it possible that stimulants will help when my fatigue gets bad from fibro??” 

so far it’s early days but I definitely think I’ve seen an improvement in that regard. My med combo for my fibro, autoimmune disease, and the SSRI I was on has also been ducking my with appetite and I was struggling to feed myself properly. So far on stims I’ve noticed an improvement in appetite, fatigue, and sleeping better. I reckon stimulants have a possibility to be really helpful for people with fibromyalgia and I’m hoping that it starts to be explored and recognised more for as possible treatment option for it"
Ritalin at 9 months <3,The CFS and fibromyalgia thing is really interesting because I’m wondering if it will somehow help with my small fiber neuropathy that I’m suffering from after Covid/Covid vaccine. During my research on why the vaccine could possibly cause neuropathy some people suggested that those with differing brain configurations could be more prone to developing neurological issues from either Covid or the vaccine. Of the people who I also know that are going through similar things a lot of them seem to have a comorbidity with ADHD very interesting stuff thank you for sharing that.

Ritalin at 9 months <3,"The last two are huge for me, especially in the workplace."
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"I'm six months in and this list is an almost perfect encapsulation of the benefits I have had also. Fantastic summary, thank you. And great to hear your gains."
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"This is really great. I started on ritalin about 7 months ago and was off it for a few months because of health issues, but it's helped me so much in the time I started it and now that I'm back on it. Points 3 and 6 really resonate with me, my mind has always been very negative/sensitive/on edge. When I found I was suddenly able to go about life without my mind telling me so and so is mad at me, what did I do, they're being mean to me, I'm awful, I'm lazy, I feel left out even though I was the one who decided not to go... now I'm less paranoid about how people feel about me, I can take criticism, I can keep up with the people I love and not take it personally when they take a while to get back to me. I'm more open and vulnerable with the people I love. Although you can tell I still can't edit my words lol, I can only write essays or 1 sentence.

And points 5 and 7- I am still a mess but i have the drive to go through everything and un-jumble it once or twice a week instead of having it pile up for so long I don't know where to start. And for 7- I'm finally motivated to do the basic things for myself I've always wanted to but just somehow couldn't. Stretching every day, trying to get some steps in even when I don't feel like it, keeping on top of my hygiene in terms of showering, skincare, dental care. I went years with awful dental hygiene and my brain would always say just get up and do it! Now! But my body wouldn't move. Now it does. My body responds to my brain and will just get up and do it. If not that second, I still manage to get it done before the days end. 

Thankyou for this post. You really explained everything I feel so perfectly, and I'm sure heaps of others here feel the same way."
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"The memory part of being on medication was a game changer for me. I am sure my relatives and college friends just assumed all these years I was just an ass as I never could remember their birthdays or even to call them on holidays etc. Have not been taking meds very long, still may need to up my dose, but a big improvement in that area.  


In years past I had to live glued to Outlook's calendar and reminders or I would forget things 99% of the time, even on weekends I had to write sticky notes all over to keep it in my head. Very easy to feel something is wrong with you somehow, or ""willpower"" rather than ADHD causing these issues. I always blamed myself."
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"Took my first dose today! Thank you so much for this post, I'm excited to see the effect that it has personally."
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"I’m glad stuff worked out for you!!

I have JUST started Ritalin 5mg 2-3 times a day! After having no luck on equasym and vyvanse/elvanse. Wish me luck 🙏

As a first impression I’m feeling a bit euphoric."
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"This is so good to read 😊 just want to ask, do you ever take a day off from the meds, or take them no matter what? I’ve been on ritalin for ten years now, and have had multiple doctors prescribe it, some who said to take it daily, and others who say to skip it if i don’t have work. In my experience, it works best to take a break occasionally. Like it helps my body recalculate and relax, then be ready to go back into productive mode. Sometimes I’ll go a whole month without a day’s break, but by the end i feel terrible."
Ritalin at 9 months <3,This was super helpful as I’m starting Ritalin tomorrow and was kind of blindsided at my psychiatrists choice of med. I’m not even sure why I was uneasy about her choice but reading your post has given me so much reassurance
Ritalin at 9 months <3,I really can empathize with the part where you mention that it’s “not the temporary euphoria” but rather the progress you see day in and day out. It’s easy for people to abuse or view stimulants in a negative light but that is what it’s all about. It can really change our lives.

Ritalin at 9 months <3,"Many thanks. I needed to hear it/see it, as I'm still waiting for diagnosis.

And

 I had major realisation from point 3 and 6, I can feel a bit of happiness when watching movies or see other people happy but I do feel empty. From other side, I am horrible affected by negative emotions."
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"Gonna a get down voted for this, but sometimes I can't help but read something like this and think it's like a pharmaceutical Rep wrote this. But besides my snideness, which I'm sorry for, I am also happy for you, and a little jealous the meds work for you. For me they sap my soul and I become a laser focused lonely shitty sleeper."
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"Thanks I always wanted to hear a longer term report of pros and cons. Like you said usually it's just new users who post.

Now if only people who have used it for a decade or two would post..."
Ritalin at 9 months <3,Do you mind sharing your age?
Ritalin at 9 months <3,Okay this seriously convinced me that I need to try it. Do you take it daily?
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"This could describe me as well, I also took it, (since I was a child), well is called Aradix here tough (the same thing).

Altough it gives some Anxiety I learn to ignore."
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"Regarding the memory, do you take ritalin when not working / needing it?

I only take it when I work and struggle with remembering names for example in social events

Afaik you can't drink alcohol with ritalin either



If you don't mind sharing, what's your medicine routine and dose like?"
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"Off topic, is Ritalin the first medication you were prescribed or have you on others like Vyvanse?"
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"Interestring. Is that list of stuff things that build up over time while on the meds? Like not something that you noticed after perhaps a few weeks, but over the months?

&#x200B;

I've had a hard time with dexedrine (first med I've tried) the last couple of weeks. First part was great, then it seemed to be not very effective, then upping the dose left me feeling quite anxious - bit more able to focus than the lower dose but then at night i'd feel palpitations and tightness of chest and potentially anxiety. Now lowering my dose back down and hm.

Just feel dispair. Also wonder if these drugs reduce the effectiveness of effexor etc. Which I'm also considered about as effexor works on norepinephrine and so does dexedrine - and i wonder if I'm getting 'too much' norepinephrine as a result, but the dopamine and whatever else the dexedrine does is good aside from that?"
Ritalin at 9 months <3,I sound like you 9 months ago. Have things changed over the 9 months or has it been the same since day one?
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"I’m worried about starting Ritalin because my health anxiety tells me I may die suddenly from it as it’s a listed side effect.

Wish my anxiety would go away."
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"Is there anyone in Melbourne willing to sell any Ritalin tablets? I'm out, I do have an appointment for another script but not till next week and I'm having withdrawals so badly"
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"Hi, sorry for the late reply, but how often and when do you take it? I want the same results as you but only take it 5 days per week"
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"As an ADHD dude, I know that bulleting can help a lot. I added some more detail in case you wanted more, but it's summarised at the beginning of each point like you say! 

I thought I should open up this discussion after reading a different thread where people were discussing the 'just tried meds' thing being too prevalent. I agree, it's good to hear the longer term on it. I hope it helps! 

There are a couple side effects like I sometimes struggle to get to sleep if I don't exercise regularly (but I do, because it's good for me!), and depending on which form you take and the brand sold, you can get different effects like for me I got put in a cheap version and I got neck tension alot which I didn't before. 

But overall it's worth it for me."
Ritalin at 9 months <3,I Second the bulletpoints appreciation as well as the middle/long term effect point of view. I start on meds next week!
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"Bless you! I hope it helps! I want to see everyone able to succeed in life so if it gives some perspective to anyone on long term use, it's done its job! 

You are awesome! 😌"
Ritalin at 9 months <3,You're welcome lovey! 😌
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"Hi, what dosage ? I find i have built tolerance and contemplating change to Ritalin. 1 yr on dex then Vyvanse..."
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"I think, so long as you are making clever choices and working on your overall systemic health, then you will continue to see improvements. 

For instance, I am not as sharp as I can be when I eat poorly, sleep poorly, do not exercise, do not take certain vitamins that I know help for me. 

The meds give you a new baseline and you can then help build on that even further by incorporating the other things that really improve your overall  health, which helps your brain function better!"

Ritalin at 9 months <3,For me yes. I have been much better able to plan for future events. Especially noticeable has been breaking large projects with a future completion date into smaller manageable chunks. This was literally impossible to do on my own in the past. I would either get entirely overwhelmed and not start or start and rush to complete the whole thing all at once while making lots of mistakes along the way and leaving an incomplete disaster.
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"I would say that I'm capable of making long term goals which I can stick to. For instance, I'm working on getting my push up number up by the end of the month. I want to try and do 1 pull up as well. Longer term, I have a place on a masters course in psychology starting next year, and I'm saving as much money as I can to cushion the financial blow of that. I'm also doing a ten week Floristry course and I hope to use those skills to start a side hustle in my local area! 

So yes, short term, mid term and long term goals all in motion for me!"
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"I'm exploring it. I find it's very difficult to get a Lyme disease diagnosis and I am monitoring my health to see if any autoimmune stuff comes up. I think it's possible and likely that it will, but I'm also enjoying my life and looking after my body better, so who knows?"
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"I thought I would share what some of experience has been with working with medical professionals in my country and how my different health teams have talked about it. I have autoimmune arthritis and was diagnosed with fibromyalgia about 2 years after the arthritis because I was still feeling pain and fatigue even though my swelling and hot joints etc seemed to be under control and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories didn’t seem to help. Rheumatologist didn’t give a lot of info after diagnosing me but she never does haha (I personally dislike her bedside manner but w/e her nurses are nice and the meds she gives me work). She said it’s common for people with autoimmune disease to also develop fibro. Prescribed me low dose amitriptyline, took my first dose that night and felt a huge difference when I woke up the next morning and realised I had actually had really poor sleep quality until then and didn’t realise! I also felt improvement in my exec functioning and was like 👀 because I hadn’t pursued ADHD diagnosis then but knowing amitriptyline did norepinephrine and that that norepinephrine was a part of ADHD. Anyway that’s just a side note haha. 

My GP doc took time to give me more info about fibromyalgia but had a general gist from her and the rheum that some think that fibro can happen when the nervous system goes through too much and kinda freaks out and overreacts (causing pain) kind of thing.

Then I went on a fibromyalgia pain management course with the pain clinic occupational therapist. They said that they believed that fibro was probably inflammation in the tiny muscle fibres either caused by a lack of having the right things it needs like oxygen or whatever idk. I stopped going after the first 2 of the 4 sessions as I wasn’t learning anything new and they kept talking about breathing exercises and they explained Spoon theory wrong lol. 

Anyway, it seems kinda like each person had their own theory on fibro. What is interesting to me though is that we don’t actually have Lyme carrying ticks etc in my country. My mum got unwell after visiting Mongolia and suspects she got Lyme disease there, but I have never left our country and so haven’t been to a place where I could have caught it. But I still have fibromyalgia, whatever it is that medics and scientists end up figuring it out to be. And that so far amitriptyline works. Im just glad that the industry seems to be taking fibromyalgia more seriously now days and I hope that less of them don’t still hold the belief that fibro is just a made up thing their patients read about on the internet 😩"
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"Thank you. 

It's something that changes how you engage with experiences. It's like you can finally just enjoy most of what happens in the day, even if nothing that interesting really happens. I fully believe that this is one of the most transformative aspects for quality of life."
Ritalin at 9 months <3,Work with your doctor to titrate to the right dose and type of medication. I was lucky as the first medication was effective and the titration was simple and yielded good results. I realise that all people are different and my experience is not yours. You may need to try a few things to yield results.
Ritalin at 9 months <3,And I have more than ever! 💪❤️
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"I think it's the fact that your brain is working more harmoniously. With your attention span working better and therefore memory, you are able to make more intelligent observations. The prefrontal cortex is very heavily implicated in academic ability. It would not surprise me that when we get access to it as we would have if the circuits fired properly, we gain a more realistic grasp on our total intellectual capacity."
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"That is an incredible result! 

This is something that barely anyone knows, even doctors are unaware of the crossover between chronic pain and ADHD. It's frustrating because it should be obvious. There's plenty of research to show that dopamine mediates pain signalling, as muchas it mediates attention and memory!"
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"The immune system is very heavily regulated by dopamine pathways. If it's not working properly, cause whatever that may be, it produces pain, often without obvious or clear cause. 

Inflammation seems to play a role. The immune system is too aggressive and not discriminating properly. It's partly gut-mediated, but also controlled by the brain. 

I've been doing a lot of research. I would tentatively say that there is a good chance it may help reduce that pain, but that will depend on the actual cause."
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"Congrats to you too. It's the only way I can really describe it, but it feels amazing to not have to cower at people's emotional reactions to things. I can't believe how different that feels."
Ritalin at 9 months <3,Awesome! The euphoria is not something to hold onto. Look at the cumulative effects! That will give you a better idea! :)
Ritalin at 9 months <3,🙏😌
Ritalin at 9 months <3,❤️
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"Good! I hope it improves things for you! Take the long view and check where you've come in a few months or even a year, it was a good exercise to reflect on it! Real progress!"

Ritalin at 9 months <3,Oh same 😌
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"All the best to you too, keep going! :)"
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"I'm so so glad it resonates with you. It's amazing how subtle the changes are, but they really make a massive difference. 

It's so validating to know, when people thought you were lazy, it was just ADHD. Willpower doesn't factor into it. If your brain isn't working right, it isn't working right, and with the right support, THEN you can engage your willpower towards the goals that matter to you.

Life opens up, and you know that what you went through wasn't your fault."
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"Yea, biiig help with socialising. People get so pissed when you forget important things about them..I can understand why but having some control now helps with that. 

Yea, can really make you hate yourself when you realise how that impacts others and how you don't feel in control of changing that."
Ritalin at 9 months <3,Good luck! 🙏
Ritalin at 9 months <3,I take it every day and feel fine. :)
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"I would just say that Ritalin is a good starting point because it works for a lot of people. Even so, if you can't find a dose that works, you have other options! It can take some time to find the best medication!"
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"I've never been happier because of what I can achieve now. I feel alive maybe for the first time in my life. I did a lot of work on myself. Trauma work. That helped too, but the medication is facilitating that personal change faster than I would have made it on my own. I am so grateful every day for what I am allowed to experience because I am lucky enough to have been assessed later in life and found my way."
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"It's not really a feeling of 'i feel joy or great or happy'. For me, it's more like I have limitless potential, sort of a capacity for anything, which is not exactly joy, more an expression of complete opportunity or potential. That's not quite the same, but I think it manifests differently for different people.

I've had real euphoria and it's nothing like that. 

It last about a week or two, I can't quite say definitively."
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"I will say that there are other things that may be at play bar ADHD causing this issue for you. I would explore that as much as possible with your doctor. I would keep trying different types of medication and titrate to different levels with each. You cannot say that there is no possible fit for you without going through the options methodically. 

You deserve to be happy and functional and I hope you can get to that place. Please don't give up!"

Ritalin at 9 months <3,29 👍
Ritalin at 9 months <3,I hope it works out! I take it daily when I wake up (extended release). 👍
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"I take it every day and I'm not bothered about drinking. 

I take it when I wake up and I'm on 36mg XR"
Ritalin at 9 months <3,I was prescribed ritalin first and have tried nothing else. I'm in the UK.
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"Hi, yes I would say this list is cumulative long term effects. Some days are worse than others, but if I don't sleep well or I do something bad for my health, I could expect that to happen anyway. 

I do have the anxiety a but sometimes when I come off them in the evenings and sometimes it impacts my sleep, but I exercise regularly which I find really 'burns off' the excess energy that turns into anxiety. I feel fine with that set up. 

You might be getting a weird balance of neurochems but it's hard to say. I felt that ritalin was less effective when combined with amitriptyline which I was on for a couple of months. I don't take anything except the ritalin now."
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"I would say things have developed over time. The effects are noticeable straight away, but time helps the skills develop."
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"I have health anxiety and I think you just have to pick up the medication and take it and see what happens. 

The chance of heart failure from ritalin at normal dosages is extremely low and us a very rare side effect. I take this medication daily and have done for almost a year and have had no heart related side effects. 

You can have some anxiety when it wears off but this is just anxiety and not heart related..

Work with your doctor to make sure that you're monitoring for any side effects."
Ritalin at 9 months <3,I take it when I wake up and I take it every day.
Ritalin at 9 months <3,<3 Brilliant outlook and mindset :)
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"Started at 20mg Vyvanse for a couple of years, then 30mg for around 4 years, and today I've been on 40mg for about 4 years. About to move to 50mg or try Foquest."
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"So the key with Lyme disease, based on my experiences anyway, is to work with a LLMD. A Lyme literate medical doctor. They are a normal medical doctor who is versed in Lyme disease. Google for LLMD in your area…

Also, to get an accurate Lyme disease test it need to be sent to specific labs. The ones a lot of doctors use are known to be inaccurate so a negative result doesn’t mean much. Some states are requiring patients to sign a paper acknowledging that the test isn’t accurate... 

Lyme disease treatment is getting better and more doctors are becoming aware, but just like you’d go to a heart specialist for heart issues, find a Lyme specialist for Lyme disease. Even if you use an LLMD to rule out Lyme disease and move on- that’s still huge progress!"
Ritalin at 9 months <3," Lyme disease is on every continent- even Antarctica- so you don’t have travel to have Lyme disease. Also, some studies show person to person is possible, but weather that’s because it’s transmitted via sex/kissing/intimate contact or instead because families are usually in the same environment so they get infected separately, is debated

So even though you haven’t traveled it’s still possible. I don’t know how likely etc though… I’m definitely not a doctor of any kind…"
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"Could you mention the negative side effects?
Like for example with prozac I sometimes feel numb, like I don’t actually feel things. Now that I lowered my dosage I feel more. Does retalin have a similar negative impact?"
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"What does XR stand for?

I take ritalin, but it only works for 3 hours, so have to take more throughout the day"
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"Ok thank you, I’ve had extensive checks on my heart and I have no issues or underlaying problems, but the anxiety always try’s to trick you, it doesn’t help that when I tried Vyvanse I got heart palpitations and really bad sweats / anxiety, I never touched that stuff again lol , dextroamphetamine was always good for me tho. 

I think I’ll start it, I’m tired of my ADHD executive function issues, I was to progress."
Ritalin at 9 months <3,Thank you :) ❤️
Ritalin at 9 months <3,Thanks for the information :)
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"I don’t doubt you on that, but I’m fairly confident I couldn’t catch it where I live. I live in New Zealand (I know we are always forgotten about by the rest of the world lol) and the general understanding here is that there are no Lyme carrying vectors in our environment https://www.health.govt.nz/your-health/healthy-living/environmental-health/pests-and-insects/ticks"
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"Sure! 

So one thing to start with is that negative side effects very much depend on you, the medication and what version of the medication you are taking. 

For me, the most consistent side effect is that I can find it hard to get to sleep straight away. I tackle this by incorporating weight training into a fair few of my days in the week. It ensure that I'm too tired to stay awake and I get a good night's sleep. 

When I was on a generic form of ritalin called delmosart, I also experienced tension headaches and neck tension towards the end of the day. The med was a bit more rough on my stomach as well, so I was more sensitive to foods than I was before. 

Now I'm back on concerta (after much fighting with my gp), I'm doing fine. Which brand you can get does matter! The cheaper ones can be a bit rough! 

Other than that, a bit of dry mouth, but nothing severe, occasionally eating at lunch can be a tiresome affair. But compared to the benefits, I think it's a small price to pay!"
Ritalin at 9 months <3,Extended Release (XR) lasts about 8 hrs
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"I think that you should start with a low dose and work up. The things is as well your anxiety can cause the palpitations anyway, so you may be working yourself up and the medication is completely unrelated."
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"Sounds reasonable…I’m jealous!

But the question then is what’s actually causing the issue…"
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"Wow thank you so much, that definitely doesn’t sound too bad"
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"We take bio security really seriously here Hahahha. You can get fined or sent back where you came from for bringing undeclared fruit and vegetables when you fly into the country! 😂

(Eg 
- [someone fined $30,000 for not doing the proper bio security on some shipping containers](https://www.mpi.govt.nz/news/media-releases/man-fined-30000-for-biosecurity-breaches/)
- [Suspending imports of fruit from Australia that were safe for consumption but had a fruit disease not present in our county](https://www.mpi.govt.nz/news/media-releases/routine-border-checks-detect-unwanted-fruit-disease/)
- [Denying entry and sending them back to where they flew from for having fresh chillies and some seeds in their luggage](https://www.mpi.govt.nz/news/media-releases/fijian-passenger-denied-entry/)

There was some [research last year that suggests fibromyalgia could actually be an autoimmune disorder](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/fibromyalgia-more-evidence-of-links-to-immune-system) which makes sense considering how many people with autoimmune disease have it co-morbid. Plus autoimmune disease can be set off from viruses and infections they reckon."
Ritalin at 9 months <3,"if it’s set off by viruses (potentially) then there is a way to cure it!  (Hopefully!)

I hope your health journey goes well for you!!  :)"

"Ritalin having zero effect on me. Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it. Is it normal to not feel anything on ritalin?","Finding the right stimulant is trial and error unfortunately.  Some people respond well to Ritalin. Other people respond well to Dexamfetamine/Lisdexamfetamine and Adderall. Some people respond to both. Others respond to neither and respond better to non-stimulants.  


I recommend talking to your psychiatrist about your options as not everyone responds to the first drug that they try. I tried both Ritalin and Vyvanse. I found that Vyvanse was more effective than Ritalin for me however YMMV."
"Ritalin having zero effect on me. Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it. Is it normal to not feel anything on ritalin?","If stimulants are doing nothing, it could mean you have ADHD. It is kinda rare, but some people with ADHD do not react to stimulants. There are other options if that's the case. Unfortunately, it also probably means you are going to need to take the test. But I'm no Doc.

I'm on the same medication routine, and when i first started Adderall I felt like my body was vibrating, and I lost my appetite. Once my body got used to it, I only noticed increased attention. The side effects went away."

"Ritalin having zero effect on me. Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it. Is it normal to not feel anything on ritalin?","Ritalin is very short acting.

Frankly I've always find Ritalin is too fast and strong to be useful,"
"Ritalin having zero effect on me. Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it. Is it normal to not feel anything on ritalin?",That's fkn crazy that you can scripted stims to check for ADHD rather than getting tested.

"Ritalin having zero effect on me. Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it. Is it normal to not feel anything on ritalin?","i started with adderall immediately release, then switched to extended release. the first few days they actually made me extremely fatigued like i needed a nap. after a week, both gave me the jitters and at times made me feel speedy but they really helped me focus.  after a while i felt that i was no longer as focused but when i upped my dosage it made the jitters much worse. i was a little disheartened.
i didn’t take anything for a bit. during that time i did some reading about all the different meds, how each person is different and that it can take time to find the right one/s for you. in that research i also read that coffee could adversely affect how you feel while taking these meds. it sounds a little silly now that i didn’t think about that and that my psychiatrist didn’t mention it 

i finally decided to give ritalin a go. before i did, i weaned myself off my morning coffee. the ritalin has been very effective for me and i do not feel speedy on it. 

good luck finding what works for you!"
"Ritalin having zero effect on me. Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it.

That’s a considerable difference. Point being, communication with your DR about this and that may be the case. I would feel the same on that dosage tbh."

"Ritalin having zero effect on me. Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it. Is it normal to not feel anything on ritalin?",Where are you in Canada? My assessment was free
"Ritalin having zero effect on me. Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it. Is it normal to not feel anything on ritalin?",It might just not be the right medication for you. Not everyone with ADHD has the same brain chemistry so you may have to go through several medications before you find one that works
"Ritalin having zero effect on me. Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it. Is it normal to not feel anything on ritalin?","Ritalin is weaker than adderall and Vyvanse, ur dose is either too low or your brain doesn't respond to it well and u need a another medication"
"Ritalin having zero effect on me. Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it. Is it normal to not feel anything on ritalin?","Could you pls elaborate on the 300cad 'proper testing'? What is it and why was I never offered that, hmmm"
"Ritalin having zero effect on me. Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it. Is it normal to not feel anything on ritalin?","10mg x2 daily: I didn’t feel anything neither.

I was sure it worked when I was at 30mg IR x2.

Now I am on 40 mg MR/day. Effect is subtle but there.

It’s not sposed to have an energy boost on people with adhd btw, unless you take way too much."
"Ritalin having zero effect on me. Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it. Is it normal to not feel anything on ritalin?",Ritalin can be subtle. Keep trialing and titrating up.
"Ritalin having zero effect on me. Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it. Is it normal to not feel anything on ritalin?",I don't feel anything like jitters or an energy boost on methylphenidate but it's highly effective for my ADHD.  It's really obvious how much easier it is to think and do things.  I do need a high dose to get that effect and 10 mg would have a rather minimal effect for me.
"Ritalin having zero effect on me. Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it. Is it normal to not feel anything on ritalin?","Maybe its because I'm from Europe, but this seems odd to me:

>Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it.

 Is this a north-American thing? Here, you would never be able to get meds without a proper diagnosis."
"Ritalin having zero effect on me. Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it. Is it normal to not feel anything on ritalin?","Thank you. She did mention trying Vyvanse as a second option, so maybe I will just get in touch with her and ask about switching to that instead. I have noticed a lot of people saying it worked well for them."
"Ritalin having zero effect on me. Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it. Is it normal to not feel anything on ritalin?","
and some of us don’t respond to even the non stimulants 😭 I would say OP that I’m not sure about normal but it’s not unheard of, I even don’t really respond to uhhhh other stimulants one might come across in life "
"Ritalin having zero effect on me. Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it. Is it normal to not feel anything on ritalin?",Thank you. Are you liking Adderall so far?
"Ritalin having zero effect on me. Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it. Is it normal to not feel anything on ritalin?",Canadian here. Check out Frida!
"Ritalin having zero effect on me. Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it. Is it normal to not feel anything on ritalin?",Oh wow! What does that even entail? Is it just an assessment or is there more to it?
"Ritalin having zero effect on me. Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it. Is it normal to not feel anything on ritalin?","Good to know, thanks. I will give it a bit more time."
"Ritalin having zero effect on me. Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it. Is it normal to not feel anything on ritalin?","interesting... I take Ritalin LA and I was finding even though it has two releases it still wore off at lunchtime when I take it at 7am, so my psych prescribed me to have it at 7am and again at 1pm. Has been working ok for me the last couple years, however Ritalin IR and LA are the only meds I've tried. Definitely curious to know what the others are like but too lazy to bother (also psych appointments are very expensive which is a factor too haha)."
"Ritalin having zero effect on me. Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it. Is it normal to not feel anything on ritalin?","Maybe? I can't see forcing everyone to fork up $300 first to help treat a relatively common disorder ever being the norm, but maybe I'm wrong. I dunno."
"Ritalin having zero effect on me. Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it. Is it normal to not feel anything on ritalin?",Thanks for the insight! It really is crazy how our bodies all react sooo differently to stuff.
"Ritalin having zero effect on me. Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it. Is it normal to not feel anything on ritalin?","gosh, where did you get yours free?"
"Ritalin having zero effect on me. Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it. Is it normal to not feel anything on ritalin?",I'm in BC
"Ritalin having zero effect on me. Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it. Is it normal to not feel anything on ritalin?","Ok that's good to know, thank you."
"Ritalin having zero effect on me. Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it. Is it normal to not feel anything on ritalin?","Sorry, I'm not really sure, that's just what she told me. I believe it's for an assessment with a psychologist? Just did a Google search and I am reading it can cost over $1k which is mental."
"Ritalin having zero effect on me. Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it. Is it normal to not feel anything on ritalin?","Yeah what I meant was that if it turns out I do not have ADHD I expected to feel something, but I don't, so maybe I do.. lol

Glad you stuck with it and found a good dosage!"
"Ritalin having zero effect on me. Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it. Is it normal to not feel anything on ritalin?",I have no idea tbh. This is my first experience dealing with this.
"Ritalin having zero effect on me. Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it. Is it normal to not feel anything on ritalin?","It's tricky because as the body gets used to it, the effects are less noticeable. I take regular breaks to avoid that bit.  I call them my sleepy days. Lots of caffeine is needed. 

But on the flip side, I honestly can say it saved my life. I could easily have ended up on the streets without it. Living life on the edge is not sustainable. Adderall allowed me to do the basic things I found impossible to accomplish consistently. 

I should add that it's only half the battle. The other half is getting in therapy to build healthy coping strategies and consistently getting movement and exercise into your days as well as eating and sleeping regularly. All these things in combination with medication are what truly changed the game for me"
"Ritalin having zero effect on me. Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it. Is it normal to not feel anything on ritalin?","If you have a complicated path to diagnosis, they won’t do it :( "
"Ritalin having zero effect on me. Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it. Is it normal to not feel anything on ritalin?","5 appointments.  I see a psychiatrist, a therapist psychologist, a testing psychologist, a the then therapist psychologist and the psychiatrist again.

The first two appointments were a verbal assessment so they could decide how to direct the test.  Then the last two appointments will be reviewing the results of the tests, from a lifestyle then medication perspective. 

I waited two years to see a psychiatrist with no result so I had to go the private route. I’m hoping the extra assessment leads to less trail and error once meds actually start but who knows?  I’m basically doing it because I’m desperate for treatment. "
"Ritalin having zero effect on me. Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it. Is it normal to not feel anything on ritalin?","It's just very, very different here in NZ. It took me two years to find someone who doesn't have a 18mo+ waiting list to get tested and it was a neuropsych that was $3000 and \~6 hours of straight testing.

It's extremely difficult to get diagnosed here so the idea of just 'oh try some stims and see what happens' is bizarre to me."
"Ritalin having zero effect on me. Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it. Is it normal to not feel anything on ritalin?","Yeah you gon know when it works, noises and thoughts quiet down, you narrarate your actions more and plan etc."
"Ritalin having zero effect on me. Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it. Is it normal to not feel anything on ritalin?","That's crazy! I got my diagnosis from a psychologist who works at a mental hospital in Ontario. My GP referred me, we met a few times, talked about my entire life, she also talked to my partner, then we did a long questionnaire-type assessment where my partner also answered all of the questions from his perspective. Didn't pay anything

Eta: ..so when you said ""proper testing"", I thought you meant something else"
"Ritalin having zero effect on me. Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it. Is it normal to not feel anything on ritalin?","Wow, that's great to hear! Good for you for taking control over your life. It's never easy to advocate for yourself and attend therapy and genuinely work towards giving yourself a better life. It takes a lot of work."
"Ritalin having zero effect on me. Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it. Is it normal to not feel anything on ritalin?","On Adderall right now... just started, so very low dose. I have heard that caffeine can make ADHD'ers sleepy.

I was(am?) also pretty dependent on caffeine, mostly to avoid headaches. But caffeine seems to make me sleepy-- so I'm attempting to wean myself off it. Set the Keurig to smaller cups in the morning, skipping the afternoon cup and just having one of these gums I found on Amazon which contain 40mg of caffeine.  They also have something else which is to help focus, but I'm really only taking them for the smaller, more controlled caffeine dosage.

So far it's been good-- and I really appreciate not being a slave to that afternoon cup of coffee to keep myself from getting that splitting headache."
"Ritalin having zero effect on me. Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it. Is it normal to not feel anything on ritalin?",I'm thinking of getting the same private diagnosis for ADHD in Canada. Did you do it in the Possibilities Clinic by any chance?
"Ritalin having zero effect on me. Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it. Is it normal to not feel anything on ritalin?",haha here in NZ I don't think you can even get them dispensed/prescribed without a diagnosis! AFAIK you have to have the special authority submitted first (which also has to be renewed every 2 years even though ADHD is a developmental condition so it's not exactly going away lol).  I guess at least it's as bad as places like Japan where stimulants are prohibited 🥴
"Ritalin having zero effect on me. Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it. Is it normal to not feel anything on ritalin?","Wow, that's fucking mental. Maybe it isn't the norm here and maybe my doctor is crazy, who knows."
"Ritalin having zero effect on me. Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it. Is it normal to not feel anything on ritalin?","I am doing it through the possibilities clinic.  So far I’m very impressed.  I am unofficially diagnosed with ADHD and testing is confirming if it’s combined or inattentive type.  For the first time in my 42 years, someone believes me.  I’ve always been dismissed as having a traumatic childhood but years of therapy and antidepressants are not making things much better.  I’ll get my full results and prescriptions in October.  "
"Ritalin having zero effect on me. Doctor suspects ADHD, so wanted to try medication to see how I react to it. Is it normal to not feel anything on ritalin?","Yeah, you def can't. Special Authority needs confirmed diagnosis from a psychiatrist. You can't go to a GP only and get meds."

What do you do with the euphoria of ritalin?,What euphoria?
What do you do with the euphoria of ritalin?,"i know what you mean. if you just started the medication give your body a couple months to get used to it, if the urges are really intense and you crash hard then the dose might be too high

some people are naturally more sensitive to stimulant medications so it might be the case. also fight the urge i know it’s sad but just do what ur supposed to do on it (work?) and know that on your free days you can still enjoy long periods of focus and motivation with plenty of time to do what you want :)"
What do you do with the euphoria of ritalin?,REALLLL!
What do you do with the euphoria of ritalin?,"To me, that’s the “motivation”. While I’m waiting for my meds to kick in, I usually do a task, and then it’s the “gateway” task in to actually doing stuff."
What do you do with the euphoria of ritalin?,I remember Ritalin was not fun Made me have a tick where I would twist and pull my hair out for me personally it socked me out. I was like a walking zombie. I literally started to drool in class back in high school. I basically went to my parents and told him never again. I’ve never taken medicine since for my ADHD. I’ve learned how to cope.
What do you do with the euphoria of ritalin?,"That only happened the first time I took it, so no action required."
What do you do with the euphoria of ritalin?,It might go away after a few weeks
What do you do with the euphoria of ritalin?,Tasks. Daily consistency doing repetitive tasks that require attention to detail and proper execution. It's a routine. Eating proper food and sleep are vital with stimulants.
What do you do with the euphoria of ritalin?,I feel a constant empiness in my gut and i have the urge to fill it but i don't know with what
What do you do with the euphoria of ritalin?,"The dose is relatively low. I take 10mg 2 times a day(before noon). I'm probably sensitive to it. I have a dark drug past and i was really sensitive to anything i took. I have so much to do, I'm overwhelmed. But I'm working on it. Thanks for your comment tho."
What do you do with the euphoria of ritalin?,The urge of smoking is unbelievable. Smokers might relate.
What do you do with the euphoria of ritalin?,"I did a lot of work on myself since i have a dark drug past and i can easily function without it since i learned how to live. I just gave ritalin a shot to experience the focus i never had. I'll wait to see how this goes and if it's bad for me, I'm going to cut it off."
What do you do with the euphoria of ritalin?,It's just i'm smoking a lot to keep myself occupied. I just moved to a new apartment with no furniture at all and i have so much work to do and i'm getting overwhelmed about it. It's easier to go for a smoke and texting than actually work. But i'm working on this.
What do you do with the euphoria of ritalin?,"I hope so,otherwise my lungs are gonna be black in a month and i'm gonna cough like an old motorcyclist at 24 years of age :))"
What do you do with the euphoria of ritalin?,That’s called hunger. Euphoria is a synonym to happiness and people will assume you’re talking about an experience of being high.
What do you do with the euphoria of ritalin?,That's not euphoria
What do you do with the euphoria of ritalin?,Food? Nutrient dense food. Not rubbish.
What do you do with the euphoria of ritalin?,"I completely relate. For the past years I only wanted to have a smoke when I had a drink, pretty much never felt the urge otherwise anymore which I was so happy about. 
But ever since I started Vyvanse I get the urge to smoke non stop like never before in my life, it's so stupid. 
The meds kick in and all I want to do is go have a cigarette & I give into it so many times during the day because the urge is so insanely strong and I feel like drinking (decaf) coffee and having a smoke and texting (exactly what you said too lol) is all i want to do. 

I'm still getting used to these meds and a new dosage as of today so lets hope this intense urge goes away for us or our focus gets better with them, so it gets easier to ignore. because I really dont want to smoke this much (or at all tbh)."
What do you do with the euphoria of ritalin?,"Well, I wish you nothing but the best but apparently I’ve talked to multiple and multiple people that were on the drug that shall not be named  lol and the twisting the hair thing very common so kind of keep an eye on that if you actually do take it I don’t want you ending up bold like I am. I was on if from grade 4 to grade 7 and then one day of grade 11 my grade started to dip so my father said you gotta take something so I did that for one day next day I told my dad what’s what"
What do you do with the euphoria of ritalin?,"lol I felt something similar when I first started vyvanse. It went away. Some people will tell you that it means you don’t have adhd, but meds just affect different people in different ways"
What do you do with the euphoria of ritalin?,"It's not really hunger,it's just this physicall feeling i'm calling wrong"
What do you do with the euphoria of ritalin?,"Yeah, i'm wrong about it. I just make the connection with some illegal stimulants i took in the past and i call this physicall feeling euphoria but i'm obviously wrong about the calling"
What do you do with the euphoria of ritalin?,"I completely feel you. I'm relatevely new to it so i hope it will pass soon. I think it depends from person to person how fast our body builds tolerance to it(i guess this is the reason) The focus would be awesome without feeling drugged. I cannot really smile on it or appreciate something or make jokes around with friends while i'm on it. It's that flatness i don't really like. But I like it when I have to focus on something like making music or write some more notes for my book. But I plan it and I end up just texting or searching things on my phone,play with my beard and smoke a ton. Let's hope soon this will pass otherwise i think I'm gonna quit it and search for something better for me. I also don't have an appetite at all but I can still feel the hunger."
What do you do with the euphoria of ritalin?,The twisting hair is really accurate but since i'm bald(by choice) i do it with my beard
What do you do with the euphoria of ritalin?,Pain in stomach? Like stomach growling? Physical hunger but not mental?
What do you do with the euphoria of ritalin?,Euphoria is the feeling that you can do anything.  U are at the top of the world.
What do you do with the euphoria of ritalin?,"Same bro same

“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"Man if I told someone the truth and they said something like it isn't real, we wouldn't be friends anymore. :D"
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,My ADHD causes chronic fatigue too and I feel like I so rarely meet or hear from people with that same experience!
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"Thank you for saying this. I have been trying to explain this about my daughter's chronic fatigue to others, and they believe she is lazy. It is so tiring explaining to ppl who don't understand, but I will keep advocating for her."
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"I recently did a sleep study for sleep apnea becuase of the fatigue.  Turns out I do have sleep apnea and it makes the ADHD symptoms worse!  I’m on a cpap machine now, but it’s only been 2 weeks, I still don’t feel much more energized."
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"It’s nice to know I’m not going through this alone. I usually have one or two naps a day, one during and just after work because I’m so exhausted.

My psych told me about Robert Barkley who has a theory around ADHD brains using up way more mental energy than average, but also having a smaller mental energy “fuel tank”. 
Knowing is half the battle, still tired until I can get on medication.

All the best friend"
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"I have had chronic fatigue for as long as I can remember. My mother used to laugh that when she ran a daycare, I slept longer than all the other children at nap time and continued to do so until I noticed my younger siblings wasn't napping anymore and thought I wasn't acting like a ""big kid"". Going on Vyvanse has really helped with my napping urges, but I still struggle on bad days. It helps to read that others struggle with this too."
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"Gosh, thank you so much for saying this. 

The fatigue is such a struggle. 

There was this one time when I was studying abroad, and before I knew I had ADHD, when I suddenly began sleeping for 15 or more hours a day. 

Wake up in the morning.
Go to a class if I could.
Come back to the dorms.
Sleep until the next morning.

This lasted two weeks."
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,My grandma was like that. Convinced it was all made up by big pharma to push demonic pills and get our souls. Didn't get ADHD meds till I was like 22 lol. :0
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,Thank you for that. The chronic fatigue part feels like it has ruined my life at this point. I needed to read your post.
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,I believe you because I have both but can you explain why they’re related?
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,Ritalin has helped my crippling fatigue.
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"In my early 20s I went to the doctor a few times thinking something was physically wrong with me bc I was so lazy. After all the tests nothing came up, which just made me feel ashamed that I was just lazy. 

Late 20s I was diagnosed and suddenly everything made sense. I think a large part of it was cycling through ADHD triggered depression too."
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"God I feel this! Trying to convince the doctor has been a nightmare. I'm so tired, but I wish I could be there for everyone and everything. They keep telling me it's depression but I'm depressed BECAUSE I'm too tired to live a normal life. The depression comes after the fatigue affects my life, not the other way around 😭"
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"I have the same issue! But I'm done explaining it to people. Because in their mind people with ADHD are high energy only and constantly running all over the place. They don't even know what ADHD does mentally and how it can exhaust you to the point where sometimes work is all you can do and free time is spend recharging mostly. Social events are even so much more mentally demanding, I just can't. 

Ever since social media so many wrong information has been provided about ADHD, I can't even blame people for being ignorant. And when someone does provide them with the correct information they just don't think it can be that bad."
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"this is so validating, thank you. i get fatigued somewhat frequently and have wondered if it's related to my adhd and the sort of ""boom and bust"" cycles i feel like i go through. good to know i'm not alone."
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"I have had many blood tests that say everything is fine .
I have mad ADHD that pretty much controls me 24/7.
I have chronic fatigue.
You tell me why then. Why am I absolutely exhausted every single day? Like jet lag and PMT all in a oner. Tell me ""doctor"". And nothing seems to work except my adhd meds a bit. 

Uuugh sorry. Just had to get that off my chest thanks."
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,Yeah inattentive ADHD is actually related to being chronically tired and mentally foggy
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,I sympathise as I’ve been like this forever too. For me I’ve discovered the root cause of my inattentive ADHD is my hypermobility. There are some specialists out there who now believe about a third of people with ADHD are hypermobile. A hypermobile body (HSD or EDS) can often result in chronic fatigue. I’ve been researching a lot recently and this all makes sense to me and my body type.
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"It’s crazy! I can walk miles just fine, but sit me down to try and study? My eyes water, I yawn, I want to go to sleep. Trying to explain to people is just pointless 😂. I find the fatigue to be manageable, it’s the mental side, my mind will try to convince to do not do things, and it like does a very good job at it."
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"On a day that my entire body hurts and I can barely keep up, this is an important reminder"
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"When my anxiety was quite bad in my early 20s, it was like a battery (that sometimes electrocuted me.) 2020
dialed everything up so much and pretty much paralyzed me.

At 29, now officially diagnosed, I feel like I have a crappy old throttled  iPhone battery at best. I’ve always struggled with nutrition (I suspect ARFID as well), establishing a regular exercise routine, and good sleep habits. I’m sure improving those (and sticking with it for more than a few days or a week) would expand my battery life, but the trick is finding the energy/executive functioning to do so."
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"I thought I didn’t have ADHD because I am not externally hyperactive, I’m actually the opposite - tired all the time, falling asleep randomly, etc. My energy increased SO MUCH after starting meds, I was like huh, so this is what it’s like to not need a nap after driving into work, or this is what it’s like to have energy to actually do stuff after work."
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,literally zero people believe me and it’s so hopelessly frustrating because this horrific perpetual exhaustion is so debilitating. i cant function the same as everyone else and i’m expected to live up to standards i cant achieve just because it’s easy for others. i feel ya man
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,I hace adhd and fibromyalgia and I'm always tired. But I stop to say it because people  $tupid
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"The more people are honest about how adhd affects them, the more people who don't have it will understand that it's a real thing I hope"
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"For SO MANY YEARS I denied the idea that I could have ADHD because of my chronic fatigue. I really thought that you couldn’t have fatigue and ADHD since everything I knew about ADHD was the hyperactive/super energetic stereotype. As a kid (okay, and as an adult) I was hyperactive but then when I got older and the burnout started to happen, I was faced with bad chronic fatigue. It was so validating for me to learn that ADHD doesn’t mean endless energy. I was officially diagnosed last month after years of fighting through the system and started medication, and my life has totally changed."
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,I think one of the best things that I've learned about all this is that you can just allow people to be wrong about you. You don't have to argue with them. You know what is true for you and nothing else matters. You can just try telling yourself that you have nothing whatsoever to prove to them and that they get to be wrong about you and you get to skip the whole argument and go back to living your life the way you want to.
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,Yea.  I think a large portion of adhd people do.  But not all.  I wonder if it relates to a specific presentation or phenotype
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"There are other causes of chronic fatigue. Many people who suffer from depression can also be chronically fatigued. If you are ADHD and also have chronic fatigue syndrome, you should make an appointment to see your psychiatrist and have him/her evaluate you for depression. Depression is highly co-morbid with ADHD and so it could take an antidepressant and ADHD meds to overcome depression and chronic fatigue. Talk to your doc and see what he/she can do.

Disclaimer: Please don't take anything I say as medical advice. I am not a doctor, and if you are concerned about your health in any way, please see your physician or psychiatrist for medical counsel."
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"Man, I only started meds this year at 34 and I cannot believe how much better they make me feel because of this issue. 

I feel like most of the benefit I have experienced since starting medication is how much less my fatigue has been. My concentration and focus has improved, yes, but my need for a daily nap has almost completely vanished, and that in and of itself has been a life changing positive."
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"This is 100% true- but also, if your insurance covers it/you can afford it, get blood work done that checks your vitamin D3 and B12 levels.

“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,Best way to describe the adhd fatigue is like when you got Covid and you got hit with that wave of overwhelming fatigue 🥲
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"For me, it’s partly crossover with PMS/PMDD, but the mood and energy swings are legit and can be debilitating. Can totally have a “crash day” (or more) after having a lot of focus, energy, and brain clarity. I try to detect the patterns but sometimes it just happens, regardless of amount of sleep or other factors."

“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,I genuinely thought I was the only one. Yesterday I was folding the laundry and I had to do it sitting down. I usually get exhausted after the week and require a full day of bedrest. It’s frustrating to think  that this condition (which is often overlooked) is debilitating to many. I guess it’s glad to know I’m not alone though.
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"My ADHD causes Chronic Fatigue!

I was even diagnosed with CFS years ago before my ADHD diagnosis. 

Both things I don’t feel comfortable sharing with people though. Only a select few know about the ADHD, I hide the chronic fatigue as best as possible 😔"

“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,I hear you bud. Same with me.
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,I recently got officially diagnosed with adhd and got medicine for it. My main problem is caused by my chronic fatigue which has worsened over the years leading to excessive energy drink consumption and now doctor says adderall will help with that fatigue which it does but I don’t feel too great taking it. I was hoping my fatigue is caused by something else that’s more fixable.

“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,The fatigue is one part that I wish I understood sooner.  So many misunderstandings and missed life opportunities to this.
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"Sorry to say, we are a tired bunch. In my experience, you can’t never really “beat” the fatigue either. Some days are better than others. Try to do what you can to take care of your body, (Try to get decent sleep even though that’s whole other problem itself) try to eat a good amount of protein, and honestly for me, seriously, 

Self Talk. For me I notice the more depressed I am, the more fatigued I tend to be. And even on days when you’re at peace in your mind, the tired days are easier to get through."

“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,The fatigue always gets me. I’ve recently changed my diet and exercise a bit to see if it helps at all.
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"My doctor has prescribed me sleep meds to help me sleep through the night along with my anxiety medication. I am hoping now that I am on my ADHD medication and getting closer to the right dose I’ll be able to get off some of the others, but I am sleeping and feeling so much better the next morning when I take my sleep medicine."
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"I also have depression, but it makes sooo much sense that it's also a comorbid thing :') I was always disappointed when I was out of an episode but still tired but it could have literally been my OTHER issues causing it too!

Also, my partner often talks about being tired when he's understimulated. I wonder if that's the fatigue thing?"
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"Between chronic fatigue and chronic boredom, I was miserable. It's not really something I ever even knew was part of ADHD until the last year or two when my doctor was like ""Yup, that's probably your ADHD"" after I was convinced it was depression and wanted to be put on SSRIs or SNRIs and then they didn't work. Ironically, SNRIs like Straterra and ESPECIALLY Qelbree actually made it worse for me."
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"Big yeppers!  My doc was convinced my constant exhaustion was evidence of depression, it was the adhd all along."
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"I hear you. I put everything i have emotionally and physically into my job (cause bills need to be paid) and when I get home, I can’t function. I’m dead. I don’t talk to people. I just sleep and do nothing."
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"Same. To compare notes — have you always had chronic fatigue? I used to be so energetic and hyper. Since I was maybe 25-26 I’ve just been exhausted, getting more so over time. I’m 30 now"

“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,Thanks for this. I struggle with intrusive sleep with my ADHD and it’s like no it’s not like a teenager just falling asleep cuz they’re tired. I’m not even tired! My brain just goes “bzzzzzz” it’s like a trance and I hate it. People have thought I was having a seizure. And when I say it’s ADHD their faces change like “oh so you’re just bored and fell asleep in the meeting” NO. It’s scary and intrusive and I cannot control it 
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,Nobody believes that I have ADHD because of being tired. How? I was finally dx 3 years ago when I was 42. It sucks because I’m always “sick or tired” & nobody gets it.
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"Oh man I feel this on every level, and people think it's impossible because I take adderall so how could I possibly be tired? It's crazy how much people truly don't understand."
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,The blank freaking stares when I try to explain.
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"The research shows that our brains *literally* have to work harder to keep up.  Combine that with the constant stress of always being in edge because you *know* you've forgotten something, but don't know what.  

Yeah, it's exhausting. Check out some of Dr. Barkley's videos on how to manage ADHD. Regular, sufficient sleep and consistent meals are absolutely key. Yet we live in a society so focused around productivity that doing the things that would keep us productive is denigrated."

“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,I’m right there with you. I get so damn tired by the end of the day. I sometimes just have to take a whole day napping on the weekend just to get back to a functional state
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,Grief is also a thing. Grief can make symptoms of existing conditions worse especially if unaddressed. You may want to find a therapist with guided meditation or other skill to help with this.

“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"Thank you, I feel so seen! I haven’t heard this as a symptom yet, but I have chronic fatigue and can pretty much fall asleep whenever, wherever, and almost immediately. Been tested for a ton of different things that never led to any conclusions. Since getting medicated a month ago, I no longer am insanely tired. I no longer NEED caffeine to function during the day, but it does help sometimes. Thank you for this."
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"BTW ADHD medications can often exacerbate insomnia.  Something you might want to talk to your doctor about.

Trazodone changed my life.  It turns out most of my fatigue was from chronic sleep deprivation due to insomnia.  I don't think I would have responded nearly as well to ADHD medication if not for the trazodone I started on about 3 months before bupropion for the ADHD"

Yea, I'm also struggling with major fatigue. We're finally figuring out it's add. 8 years ago, I received a major concussion, we didn't realize as a kid I had add but after the accident, it seems like the symptoms got way worse, and it affected my everyday life/school life/work life. Sadly, it was a workplace injury where the workplace claimed i was faking it that it was all in my head. I had to get a lawyer to try to get support, which failed. I ended up going back yo school with the concussion pain plus some weird side effects that no one knew what it was. I struggle to read now because i can't concentrate. People called me an idiot, lazy, forgetful, weird, and more. January hit; my fatigue got so bad I could barely walk, and then insomnia hit. I've seen so many specialists/bloodtests, but nothing showed up as an issue. A random ADD ad popped up going through the symptoms, and I fit all the checkmarks. I did an online test, and then I did my family doctors checklist. I'm going in Monday to talk with her about what are the next steps because at this point, I can't even work while being this fatigued. My teachers, my bosses, and my parents all got really annoyed when I struggled to finish a project because my attention wasn't all there."
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"This is something I wish I could get across to those deciding my disability case. I've ruled out other factors, to the best of my / my docs' knowledge, and as far as I am aware, I don't have CFS. It's just that between AuDHD and my other diagnoses...I am so damn tired all the time."
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"Hey friend,

ADHD peoples brains work differently, just like every single individual that walks on this planet.

ADHD people tend to feel more, process loss differently, we process feelings differently, we process our thoughts differently and on top of that we don't find pleasure in doing things we don't find fun, no one does, but its extra hard for us to do what others can and that's to sit still and focus on something that needs to be done.

These people have never experienced what happens in your head and you'll never experience what happens in theirs, just know this is a studied and subject and has medication they provide for it, which indicates its something that does affect people in their daily lives. 

ADHD burnout is something most ADHD people experience, dang, even some Autistic people get the same type of burnout. Imagine being different and knowing you think and act differently to everyone else, and you require more energy in completing tasks, staying focused, holding eye contact, not fidgeting, yada yada yada the list goes on.

Be kind to yourself, take sometime for yourself doing the things you love take time off work specially when you're feeling overwhelmed and experiencing this burnout. 

I'd suggest doing some research on Cognitive behavioral therapy, providing solid structure in your life as well as speaking to a therapist.

I promise you this will change the way you think about yourself and other people, and you will be MUCH happier because of it.

Ya pal,   
Ernie"
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"The past 3 years for me have involved the dawning realization that I have chronic fatigue and it's linked to my ADHD. 

Each time I've tried to force myself through pushing too hard for too long, it's resulted in a debilitating crash and burnout that I never fully recover from.

Y'all be sure to give yourselves some grace"
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"is chronic fatigue in ADHD related to executive dysfunction, or are they one in the same/correlated? i’m diagnosed with ADHD and often find myself feeling chronically exhausted mentally and physically, i believe stemming from executive dysfunction—when i take stimulants such as adderall, a lot of this exhaustion seems to dissipate, and i feel much more functional."
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"TIL that adhd causes chronic fatigue. and might be the reason for mine. thank you for the info, and i’m sorry you deal with difficult people"
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,It takes a lot of energy for me to be around people. I used to drink a lot to hide it…but I’m good with staying home now.
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"I always got mfs telling me “what’s not  wrong with me” but when I show symptoms they make fun of me or say something insensitive. I experience this same issue and honestly it’s sad because when you’re showing signs of mental issues or disorders, those around us may be ignorant of what we go through. Especially within certain demographics of the black community or society in general that lack information and empathy on mental health. It’s so hard for me to get anything done throughout a daily basis… but there’s ways to work around it"
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"My most debilitating symptom is the fatigue, and I feel guilty because even people I know who are are meds will say “I don’t want to be dependent on them”. But I literally feel dependent on them because on days I don’t take them, I’m napping every few hours and useless. I mean, yeah, I can survive, but my entire weekend used to be dedicated to cleaning, running errands, and trying to keep up"
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"I've put off all my plans after college for a while. I started my internship after everybody in my class finished it and presented it. College is over, I so badly wanna move out but I'm so confused cause all of my dreams are mixed together and Ihni what to do. But the abuse at home has reached its peak so I HAVE to leave. 

I get super tired as well. I used to be anemic. My haemoglobin levels were at 7. I was interning then, in Dubai, the sun was super hot, I would barely make it home. 
After I came back home I got better. 
But lately I'm tired all over. I honestly don't know what to do anymore. 
What did you guys do abt it?"
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"I have tears in my eyes since I really needed to read this. Years and years of people “teasing” me over how I “love” to sleep (more like am physically unable to get out of bed, whether or not I want to) have finally started to crush me and any stab at how I’m always tired by anyone I know has finally resulted in me breaking down and crying. Doesn’t help that I am currently under the most stress of my life in grad school, with struggles that have led me to resent my brain and ADHD every single day, but yea. It’s so hard to be okay with something about yourself when society is so adamantly against things you cant control. 

Thank you for the post 💜"
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"My whole life was dominated by this fatigue and AdHD. In my teen and 20s I notoriously fell asleep in school. And often it took all the way until noon until I feel awake. 
That's why I abused caffeine so much. But it only gets you so far.
It got a little better in my 30s but it still causes me to be late at work and stuff."

I have seen a huge difference in how restorative my sleep is due to this."
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,Thank you for this message! I have been trying to figure what the cause of my chronic fatigue is. Is there anyway to fix the fatigue without the adhd meds?

“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"How does that work, I ask it because I might have adhd but also have epilepsy, the aed might have supressed the hyperactivity but I always blamed them to make me tired. A few days ago I accidentally forgot them...still tired.

“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,Try magnesium citrate.  You are mentally fatigued because your brain doesn't stop thinking. Actually go to gym or exercise and u will find you have more energy as that will be the zen effect as when you are exercising the racing thoughts will calm. 
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"I also have these issues. I find a lot of it is just perpetual burn out, where if I am able to recoup then my energy comes back. 

The problem is, the moment you push yourself or you get pushed beyond your limits then it comes back. I’ve had it so bad that it messed up my eyes by causing an eye condition called CSCR (Central Serous Chorioretinopathy). So I recommend to not get too stressed out."

“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"Technically speaking; this sounds more like SCT than ADHD
How was your school scores?"
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"My chronic fatigue is actually why I got diagnosed, at 35. After years of doctor visits and blood tests to figure out why I was permanently exhausted, my doctor asks if I've ever been tested for ADHD. It never crossed my mind because I only knew of the stereotype, which I don't fit. Lo and behold, it's been making my life difficult since I can remember."
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,You may be iron deficient… iron deficiency without anemia is very common in those with ADHD.
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"My ADHD means I struggled to make, much less keep, friends my entire life, and when I have developed a relationship with somebody the RSD kicks in almost immediately which usually ends with me withdrawing and not communicating with them for several months. I am 40 and can count acquaintances/maybe frirnds that I am not related to on one hand. 

And so after 20 years of not developing friendships, the social anxiety set in. My favorite excuse is my kids for anything, and it's usually true. But because of a lack of friends, I am rarely invited to any type of social anything. The social events I attend are for my kids sake, to be there for them, and I have to heavily mask. It's exhausting.  Fortunately my husband understands this ADHD symptom and supports me when I am ready to leave."
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"I’m sorry about reactions you get. 

OMG, you answered what I’ve been thinking about. I thought I’ve got chronic fatigue syndrome, or that generally my mental illnesses caused it. or both. but I would never ever thought that ADHD can cause it. I knew about burnout etc. but didn’t think about it as fatigue syndrome."
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"If anyone needs to hear this!!
I also always struggled with that, ritalin helpt a ton BUT i recently found out i was sleeping too much! Might not be the case for everyone but might be worth testing right? Ik sleep 6h en go to bed at 5 am consistently 😇"
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"I am so glad I found this thread! Validation!
My ADHD symptoms began at age 9, along with irritable bowel and Tourette's.
- Then came depression and insomnia (circadian rhythm disorder) @ age 15.
- Chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia at age 36 while working as a biotech executive.
- Spent the next 15 years in bed and hooked on opiates and benzos, with Ambien for sleep. I searched out so many specialties... infectious disease, GI, Psychiatry... I loved hearing how it was probably in my head.
Funny, that's where it was (mostly).
- I'm now 56, and ADHD has stolen half my life, and frustrated the rest.
Roughly 40% of people with ADHD will encounter a substance abuse issue at some point. I found mine in alcohol, and it stole nearly everything I had. 
ADHD is certainly connected with chronic fatigue, but it's SO much more!!
With a couple of nursing degrees under my belt, I started to hyper focus on the underlying mechanisms, pathways, neurotransmitters and hormones to mind map the connections between ADHD and all related comorbidities. No pun intended, but it's mind-boggling. 
I am a Master Divergent and I seem to have picked up almost all related illnesses LOL. It must be in my head.
Don't give up, fight the fight, you're worth it, now take every opportunity to educate those around you. Maybe we can spare some misery for the future generations."

“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"I have it as well. There are other causes of chronic fatigue, though, so do your dilligence with your health. For me, it is also a blood disorder and g6pd enzyme deficiency. Both involve iron anemia, and low iron causes fatigue and increased adhd symptoms."
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,Yeah I wonder if it’s not a lot of us or if a lot of people think it’s normal to be tired all the time

“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"Same :') The fatigue was actually what led me to getting diagnosed - I was just so tired of feeling tired all the time.


I still do feel tired all the time (meds help, until they stop helping, then the side effects kick in and make me wish I'd never taken them in the first place), but at least now I know why, and that I'm not alone."
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"My chronic fatigue has stood in the way of getting a diagnosis and then actually getting medication. 

I saw the term bed rot once and that struck a nerve. For the first several years of my journey the fatigue was always blamed on depression. So that how my psychs decided to diagnose me. Cue Wellbutrin. Sort of got me out of bed but then the rest of my symptoms came in to play and gave me another reason for depression and of course I could t manage to take my meds properly.

Finally got a real diagnosis, and then….

Wellbutrin. 

Because, well I can’t remember what excuse they gave. So I started the process again, ended up doing a cold turkey off Wellbutrin because I forgot and then could t find my bottle, and now I’m back on the Hampster wheel of trying to find an alternative.

And I’m still an insomniac with chronic fatigue."

When I’m off work and my son is with his dad, I can sleep for days at a time. Like, I get in bed and the only reason I get up is because my body hurts from laying down for so long (and that’s if I don’t just go and sleep sitting up once I can’t lay down anymore.) After all that sleep, though, I am still so exhausted that I cry when I have to get up and go back to work. I’m afraid to drive because I fall asleep at the wheel. I fall asleep at work.

At this point I’m making a list of things to have my doctor check up on in our next appointment, because while ADHD can contribute to fatigue, I don’t think what’s happening to me right now is normal. 

At least I hope it’s not, because for example the last 2 days I’ve spent almost entirely in bed/on the couch watching movies and napping 3-4  times per day because I don’t have the energy to do anything else.

I know it’s bad when trying to move around doesn’t help. I went out and walked about 1/2 mile and when I got home I was still just as foggy, sleepy and lightheaded as before and fell asleep on the couch about 20 minutes later"
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,That sucks!! It’s so cool you don’t think she’s lazy and that you advocate for her
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"Ditto. My daughter is just starting to realize her symptoms of ADHD and chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia just like her Dad. I certainly fly cover for her, like no one did for me. And I'm blessed to take the treatments that have worked and bring them to my kid. "
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,you have no idea how amazing you are
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"Not to dismiss ADHD causing fatigue in its own right, but sleep disorders are definitely a co-morbidity with ADHD. I was actually diagnosed with narcolepsy first. I'm still waiting on the sign off to get ADHD meds because the narcolepsy meds and ADHD meds combo are bad for the heart."
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"Give it time, my partner just went through this and it took a while to get used to sleeping with the mask. We were told his adhd would get worse but it took a few months to see the extra energy as he sleeps uninterrupted now."
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"Do you need to snore to have sleep apnea?  I sleep terribly but I've dismissed this because everyone I know that has sleep apnea had terrible snoring issues as verified by their partner.  My husband says, that like many people, I only snore when I'm sick or SUPER tired."
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"I too have sleep apnea and adhd. After 9 months of CPAP, things are getting better. It’s not easy though. Keep going!"
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,What sleep problems were you having that made you do the test?
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"I also got diagnosed with sleep apnea after doing a sleep study and I gave up on the cpap after a couple of months. It actually made me sleep worse because of how disruptive it was. IIRC it even made me choke on my own spit occasionally.

Personally I wonder if we don't go through the sleep cycles the same way as normal people and it shows up as sleep apnea in a study? Because if I still have enough adderall in my system, stay super hydrated, and go to be early, I can get slightly better sleep."
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,Just got on medication and I haven’t taken a nap at work since. I’m able to get up early and stay awake all day until it’s time to wind down for sleep. Medication helps so much with my adhd and chronic fatigue. Killing two birds w one stone is the best feeling ever.
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,I hope everything works out soon!

I just say I'm sick but it happens so often. I tend to disappear, don't step out, ignoring calls and messages."
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,): my mother in law has fibromyalgia and that stuff is wild.
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,This 1000 times yes!
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"At least in my case, the chronic fatigue is a result of having to ""stay on top of myself"" for every waking second of my life (excluding times of escapism).

Like the feeling of ""if I let go for a moment, I'm going to fuck up"". So I have to be constantly conscious of every thought I have and action I make because I don't trust my brain and body to do the right thing."
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,Yes exactly I’m so curious about that
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,Probably hyperactive vs inattentive ADHD. Inattentive types being the ones more likely to have chronic fatigue.
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"For me, the chronic fatigue is caused by ADHD. I used to think it was due to depression (which I was diagnosed with at 14), but turns out that the depression went away after I got my ADHD diagnosis in my 30s (unfortunately the fatigue remained). The diagnosis, treatment and education about ADHD put everything into perspective for me and I realized all the horrible depression I had dealt with for most of my life was due to struggling with undiagnosed ADHD."
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,If you don’t mind me asking what do you take?
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,😭 that sucks hopefully you can get your levels up. Yeah when I wanted to start meds they made me get blood work and very fortunately everything’s normal
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,😭 I just want to tell your dad go look in the mirror bro
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,I’d love to hear more about how you deal with people
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,😭
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,So it’s an adhd thing too sometimes!!
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,You too!! ❤️
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"Oh yeah it takes a while for me until I get energetic, and then I can be hyper for a period of time, and then I’m tired for the same amount of time afterward. If I expend a large amount of energy, the fatigue afterwards will also be large. It seems like my natural state is hyper for an hour then tired for an hour, but I try to force myself to keep at a normal pace so I don’t overexert myself. If I’m super busy for a week, I’m out for like three weeks I think. Without meds I’m only able to be active for eight hours a day, and that includes brushing my teeth making food eating using the restroom commute, so I’m productive for less than eight hours.

I have no idea if this is how it works for other people who have fatigue from adhd though. 

I hope everything works out well for you!!"
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,I’m on Wellbutrin and Buspar for mine and I really like it. I hope everything works out well for you!
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"I agree! Before I started meds I wasn’t able to do those things, but now I’ve started working on them. I mean, first step is not skipping meals cuz I’m too tired 🙃 but we’ll get there lol"
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,I called my states information line and they gave me the number for a social service that helps with house chores or activities in the community. Hopefully there are resources near you that are helpful. I’m also applying for disability
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,Yeah lol ever since I was a kid I just never noticed cuz my mom let me read all day
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,Yeah omg vitamins save my life esp when I get too tired to eat
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"You just made me feel so fucking seen. I am also in grad school, 6 weeks away from finishing and I’ve been suddenly struck with the absolute worst fatigue cycle i have ever experienced. I am at the top of my class, perfect 4.0. My final paper for my second to last course was due 11:59 pm on Thursday and I have been completely incapacitated all week.  I simply cannot write it. I don’t know how to explain it really except I am totally immobilized to the point that doing anything more than simply existing is too much. I want to just die but even that feels too hard."
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"About 1/3 of people with narcolepsy have ADHD symptoms, but it’s not the same the other way around. Only about .18% of people with ADHD have narcolepsy, and that’s a generous, upper-limit estimate."
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,Thank you! Actually I’m very fortunate that I sleep well but narcolepsy sucks ):

“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"1. Enough sleep, my husband needs like 9 hours a night average
2. Enough movement ideally 1 hour a day heart rate up breathing up 
3. Get as much sunlight as you can
4. Try to get 75-80% of your food from non processed or minimally processed food, keep hydrated, lots of fruits and veggies protein complex carbs
5. Quality social connection
6. Being mindful of all the people and living things and resources needed to provide you your food while you eat, like thinking about how hard the farmer worked, all the sunlight your apple needed, the cocoa farm your chocolate came from

And that’s why I’m on meds lol I don’t do any of that. I’ve been working on it after I got on the meds though"
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"For real 😭 even my mental health professionals. My therapist told me I have adhd depression and anxiety and the fatigue is from depression, my psychiatrist told me they didn’t think I have adhd but whatever it’s fine cuz the meds seem to be working well"
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"my experience isn’t universal among people who have chronic fatigue and adhd, but it takes a while for me until I get energetic, and then I can be hyper for a period of time, and then I’m tired for the same amount of time afterward. If I expend a large amount of energy, the fatigue afterwards will also be large. It seems like my natural state is hyper for an hour then tired for an hour, but I try to force myself to keep at a normal pace so I don’t overexert myself.

Without meds I’m only able to be active for eight hours a day, and that includes brushing my teeth making food eating using the restroom commute, so I’m productive for less than eight hours.

I take Wellbutrin which gives me energy for the most part, it’s also an antidepressant. It makes me a little erratic and aggressive, so I also take Buspar which is an anti-anxiety med and that makes me calm and focused. But hearing from people it’s clear that Wellbutrin doesn’t work for everyone. I also definitely don’t have epilepsy"
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"Links to and mentions of ADDitude are not allowed on /r/adhd because we feel they have demonstrated themselves to be untrustworthy and that they, despite soliciting donations from people with ADHD to fund their operation, prioritize profit and advertising dollars over our best interests. Their website is full of articles promoting the use of homeopathy, reiki, and other unscientific quack practices. They also have had articles for Vayarin (a medical food that is now no longer sold in the US because its research was bunk) that suspiciously looked like stealth advertisements (which is highly unethical and illegal in the US).

We also find it problematic that their medical review panel includes not only legitimate doctors and psychologists, but also (at the time of writing) one practitioner of integrative medicine, which combines legit medical practice with pseudoscience and alternative medicine. They have previously had other quacks on the panel as well.

If that means limiting your exposure to their negativity,  so be it! Get outdoors to refresh your mind! Enjoy the sunshine, rain, and cloudy days! Breathe in some fresh air. I love the air after a rain! Drink some water, read a book. Anyways, you get to decide what helps you! I was/am depressed and have known for a very long time that fresh air, water, diet, and exercise (even if it just means to sweep the floor, or take the garbage out, is good for me. But I didn't do anything about it. About a year ago, I said **** it and started anyways. I am doing much better! I can walk up a flight a stairs without feeling winded lol.

“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"This. My chronic fatigue finally mostly eased up in my very late 30’s or 40-ish. I also had a blood disorder and iron deficiency anemia. Finally treating the anemia  right helped tremendously. For many years I assumed I didn’t have adhd because I was always so tired my whole life. My mom, sister and trans sister also have adhd and chronic fatigue. I really didn’t know if it was related to the adhd so it’s interesting to see this thread. My mom and sister both have fibromyalgia."

“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"Snoring is very common but not always present.  You can have sleep apnea without snoring. Has your partner ever noticed you almost not breathing and then your body flinching to get air?

After my sleep study it was discovered I was having 20 apnea events an hour.  This is only considered moderate.  People with severe experience it between 50-100 times an hour!

Mine being moderate means I probably didn’t notice the effects until years of it building up a sleep debt and fatigue on my brain and body.

Now with my cpap machine it gives me all the stats of my sleep, I have about 3 events per hour now, which is not bad at all.  And I can load the data into a program on my computer for even more detail."

“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"I felt like I was sleeping fine through the night to be honest.  But my energy levels and fatigue for the day were becoming a hinderance to my daily life and focus.

I started trail running and going to the gym. Which I really enjoyed.  But after every work out I would be totally wiped for the whole day.  I thought I just had to get used to it but after 2 years of consistency running trails, my energy only got worse.

After doing some of my own research, sleep apnea came up.  I didn’t like the idea of a cpap machine, but honestly i was so tired of being tired, that if it was actually going to help I would use it.

I contacted my doctor and got a requisition for a home sleep study ( most people in r/sleepapnea say home sleep studies are not reliable as they often don’t detect the apneas.and you should go to a sleep lab) but my home study picked them up:

Like I said I am only 2 weeks in, I am told there is a sleep debt and could take months to notice the benefit.

Edit: also my wife said I snore often and would at times sound like i was choking or stopping breathing for periods."
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"Had a cpap and hated it, went to  [https://adventknows.com/](https://adventknows.com/) got balloon sinuplasty, turbinate reduction and an oral appliance and its way better than a cpap. 

Oral appliance therapy is an ultra-simple, non-invasive option to treat sleep apnea and snoring. It’s a small custom-made mouthpiece—much like a mouth guard used by athletes – worn while you sleep. The device slightly repositions your jaw to help keep your airway open at night. Oral Appliance Therapy is a very effective alternative to CPAP"

“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"There are many variations of ADHD and not everyone has the same one. Some people can have ADHD and anxiety, some ADHD, anxiety, and depression. Others might have ADHD and ODD but none of the others. If you were depressed for years when you were younger and the depression subsided after you began to take ADHD meds, the depression and ADHD may still be causing your chronic fatigue. Sometimes when you have two or three co-morbid disorders with ADHD, you still may have to take a mild anti-depressant to get rid of the fatigue or there may be some other med that you can take for it. I believe they are all connected and the more co-morbid disorders you have with ADHD, the larger the problem. Please talk to your psychiatrist about the chronic fatigue and perhaps the two of you can come to an agreement on what you might be able take to resolve your chronic fatigue. I hope you can find something extra that will change your life. 

Again: Not a doctor. Speak to your ADHD doc before you make any changes. Also for anyone who reads this, make sure your physician has treated many adults with ADHD and other co-morbid disorders.

“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"Hm, I've been on Wellbutrin in the past but it's never had much of an effect on me, good or bad.


I've never heard of Buspar before though, I think I'll bring it up with my psych at my next appointment. Thanks for the suggestion :)"
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,Almost haha. Videography is/was my main gig for money and I am at a point now where I am on retainer and I can focus more on music. I have gotten a few soundtrack commissions recently and my streams are into the tens of thousands per year so it's not at the point where I can live off it alone but I do have a real fanbase and a bit of buzz and might get there if I get my executive function under control.
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,I was at 50. Ugggg.
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,Currently 20mg vyvanse. Its long duration is amazing and it works for me really well. Everything else gave me various side effects.
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,Exactly! Such a miracle that a medication can do so much for us and more!
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"YEEEEEEUP.

There are times where I'm like ""I'd rather go run a half-marathon RIGHT NOW than have to go do the thing I need to be doing."""
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"It all adds up! Both your thyroid condition and adhd can contribute to fatigue, even making it more severe. Are you diagnosed with adhd? If not, and you have symptoms of adhd, the two conditions are not mutually exclusive so it’s totally valid to investigate further"
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"if anyone took meds that helped with this pls lemme know, just got a psychiatrist and wanna talk about this issue and possibly try some meds. like did adderall help? maybe vyvanse some kinda stimulating med?"
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,not technically diagnosed but while i was seeing a therapist and psychiatrist they kinda were like yeah you need to get evaluated somewhere for adhd and autism. but i definitely do have adhd it’s so obvious im not just being quirky because i looked it up on the internet or something like that i definitely just need evaluated so its on paper and documented.
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"I'm learning so much too! I'm working in behavioral health now because it offers me the opportunity to learn as I work. Reprocessing my whole life has been a trip and a half! 
I keep going through grieving cycles and each time, my life expectations change. I think I'm getting more mentally healthy? 😂 
I do understand now how important it is to lower my stress level and get more sleep so that my parasympathetic nervous system will kick in and facilitate healing of the constant micro injuries we get with EDS. This seems to be key to everything else.

“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"Ohhhhhh that makes sense. Yeah it takes a while for me until I get energetic, and then I can be hyper for a period of time, and then I’m tired for the same amount of time afterward. If I expend a large amount of energy, the fatigue afterwards will also be large. It seems like my natural state is hyper for an hour then tired for an hour, but I try to force myself to keep at a normal pace so I don’t overexert myself. If I’m super busy for a week, I’m out for like three I think. Without meds I’m only able to be active for eight hours a day, and that includes brushing my teeth making food eating using the restroom commute, so I’m productive for less than eight hours."

“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"I am gradually learning to understand what it means to be my authentic self no matter what anyone thinks.  It's not easy but it's a process well worth the effort IMO.  I am beginning to let go of trying to defend myself and to let go of being outraged that people still think I'm ""wrong"" even after totally explaining things.  No one can ever understand my exact situation and feel what it's like to be me experiencing those situations.  So, I'm really not being concerned anymore about their opinions on how I handle things because their opinions don't change my situation AT ALL!  Their opinions come from their experiences and them not having to live with the outcomes of their opinions on how I should act.  Therefore, I no longer care (mostly - it's a process).  However, seeing whether certain people support me even if they disagree with my choices or continue to try and convince me they are right is an EXCELLENT way to see who I want to spend more time with and be closer to and who I don't!

So sorry you are going through this.  That is truly awful about your mom spitting on you.  My deepest regards 😍"

“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,Oh no sorry. My blood disorder is ITP which is low platelets. I have 5 children so they always check blood levels when you are pregnant. I took iron supplements on and off for years but they were hard on my stomach and I really just didn’t realize how bad it was to have low iron. I finally found some iron supplements I could take like liquid iron and iron supplements for bariatric patients which I haven’t had bariatric surgery but I like the way those supplements taste and dissolve Then when I was pregnant with my 5th child I had Iv iron. So really it was just me struggling to take my prescribed iron supplements and not taking my health problems serious enough.
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"there’s a gene enzyme test out there!! it doesn’t give ANSWER but it tells you what each gene expresses, what meds your body may tolerate as expected, and what your doctor should definitely not give you—

“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"I have had fibromyalgia symptoms like weird pain but it doesn’t happen often. 

I still don’t know exactly what has caused my iron deficiency anemia. One doctor thought maybe it was heavy periods. I don’t know if I was tested for g6pd. I just looked up g6pd and I do have food allergies especially eggs. But I guess they would have known to test for it if I had signs in my red blood cells. Which I’m assuming I didn’t. I’ve had 3 bone marrow biopsies and I was tested for lupus several times. 


I am also heterozygous for mthfr. I see that that online a lot these days. It can supposedly cause all kinds of problems but more likely to cause problems if someone is homozygous. 

It’s interesting that ADHD can run in family’s along with things like enzyme problems and fibromyalgia and stuff like that."

What do you struggle with when you say executive control?"
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"I am diagnosed! I had a psychiatrist for a year or so before I mentioned ADHD as a possibility and then she decided to treat me and my life has improved, but sometimes I wish I had like a formal test lol. But yeah I have had anxiety depression and OCD too but meds have them under control mostly"
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"Yes, I was diagnosed ADHD and then started on Vyvanse 30mg and tapered up to 40mg which is what I have taken now for 18 months. Cant comment on the other stimulants like Adderall and Ritalin, but taking Vyvanse it’s like a night and day difference. I now just do things. No decision paralysis that often felt like physical paralysis where I wouldn’t move because there was too much to do. There’s still too much to do, but I just get on with what I can and chip away at things. This is both in work and my home life so I’m doing better career wise and relationship wise with friends & family. 

If I have a day or two off meds for whatever reason, my ADHD symptoms come back in full force and I basically don’t move for a couple of days unless it’s for something fun and engaging. 

This doesn’t come without the downsides such as symptoms, the shame of needing meds to function and the potential impact it will have on health long term."

“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"A lot of studies show that a large percentage of adhd people on meds are back to baseline after a couple years.  
For me concerta worked immediately in the most (made me normal ).   I slowed down.  I was able to make perfect eye contact with people without sensitivity.  I knew that was what normal was

Adderall just gave me some forced focus and task initiation for awhile 

Both stopped working though. Maybe my specific metabolism.  
It works forever for some"
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"Yes. It has been that way! It's so much better now though. Some health issues are only being recognized now! Girls having ADHD was not even considered when I was a child. I am fortunate that my parents recognized my abilities vs my disabilities. It wasn't so for a lot of kids with ADHD, Autism, and other differences (girls especially) in the 60s.We are learning more about the human body each year now than we have known cumulatively up until now. This is the most exciting time to be alive in all of human history, IMHO."
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,What happens when you're back to baseline and also have to get off the medication? Sounds like a rough time
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,"Is it something you can cycle? Like 6 mons Adderall then 6 mons Concerta? I mean, do they start working again after a break?"
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,So the eye contact thing can also be from adhd! I had no idea
“I have adhd and it causes chronic fatigue”,Some say it’s from hyper sensitive emotional contagion.  Different from the non interest in idiopathic autism.   You can say it technically can be put under social anxiety.   Or it leads to social anxiety.   With my adhd I don’t really view my 200 comorbids as separate and distinct disorders.    I doubt I was that unlucky and ended up having so many separate disorders by chancec alone.

Back taking Ritalin only 30mg a day started a new job and legit in my room after being awake all night going to my 2nd day training ,How long is the release? Maybe you’re taking it too close to bedtime? Or maybe it’s a too high dose since you’re just back in it after not having taken meds for a while I assume? You could have built up tolerance so at the beginning you could possibly get away with less.
Back taking Ritalin only 30mg a day started a new job and legit in my room after being awake all night going to my 2nd day training ,"Sounds like the dose or type of release (ER/IR) is possibly too much for you. Staying this active and taking the meds early in the day should leave you pretty tired when trying to fall asleep 

I see you take one around 3. Maybe try to skip that dose and see if you can sleep better. I take 80mg extended every morning but it wears off in the afternoon. By night time I’m tired and ready to sleep"

Back taking Ritalin only 30mg a day started a new job and legit in my room after being awake all night going to my 2nd day training ,"I have insomnia regardless but stimulants will make it so I’m up for 2 days straight. Only thing that works for me is klonopin, ambian, and sometimes clonodine. Ask your doctor for sleep meds, sometimes they don’t want to give them to you because they’re trash though. Can’t function without meds and can’t function without sleep."
Back taking Ritalin only 30mg a day started a new job and legit in my room after being awake all night going to my 2nd day training ,Take 5-6mg Melatonin approx 30min before bedtime
Back taking Ritalin only 30mg a day started a new job and legit in my room after being awake all night going to my 2nd day training ,"I don't have this problem and actually will take a 5mg IR really close to bedtime and it helps me fall asleep faster, actually. 

However, I do still struggle with sleep for other reasons. 

Have you tried the 5mg extended release melatonin? Seems counter intuitive, but some people respond better to a lower melatonin dose. It gives you 2.5mg fast and another 2.5mg about 4 hours later to help you stay asleep. I had problems with waking at around 3am consistently and this helped a lot. 

The other thing that had a shocking improvement on my sleep is magnesium. I like the Qunol brand, it's chelated magnesium glycinate buffered, so it won't make you have to poop more. I take the ""extra strength"" version, but only a half dose of 210mg. The very similar ""regular dose"" one has a 200mg dose, but it's two 100mg pills and I'd rather take fewer pills personally. 

Also I'm a woman, men are generally recommended to take higher doses of magnesium for the same benefit. Look into it or ask your doctor. 

**Actually,** besides that, the biggest improvement on my sleep came when I started treating underlying depression. Wellbutrin is great if you're one of the people who needs it, like me. I have never in my life gotten such consistent sleep until getting on it! It's amazing. 

Consider discussing with your doc if you're maybe missing a treatment of an underlying disorder like maybe anxiety or depression. Both impact sleep and can cause excess stress."

"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Absolutely. Spent the majority of my life needlessly doing things in Hard Mode.

"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Life is hard when you’re functioning properly. When your brain is working in fast forward mode all the time some shit gets neglected and opportunities pass you by. So yeah I wish I was medicated 20 years earlier.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",just knowing earlier that most of my problems were adhd related would have been helpful
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","So this is a natural grieving process you’re going to go through.  I was diagnosed at 39 as well 46m now.  I wish I had been caught as a kid, it could have helped so much.  Yet.. it’s not like this was super well known back then, or even 7 years later for you.

Grieve.. be angry.. be sad.. get help.  Then start living your new life.  The one that now you have reasons (not excuses!) for the things that happen.  Now you can get help to cope better, you can actually ask for help you need.  You’ve got this, you’re not alone.  You can be more than you were and more than your shared condition."

I'm frustrated.  Everything has been a struggle for my entire life.  I was ""gifted"" but ""lazy"" so probably could have made something of myself if this was caught younger.  I strongly feel that I was misdiagnosed with depression in my early 20s.  As soon as I am stable on medication, I will explore the option of coming off of antidepressants.  My childhood was full of being called a brat and a bad kid, but I think I was just reaching out to try to get supports."

I'm happy that I did get the diagnosis."

I'm not angry at my parents because they couldn't have been expected to know the symptoms when they'd went their lives undiagnosed too.

It's my teachers that I have issue with. They're the ones who should have been aware of the signs and referred me onto help."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I would be miles ahead of where I am now. I look back at so many situations and instances in my life and cringe so hard. I would’ve probably been a lot more popular, less awkward, more put together, less of a hot mess express. Would’ve impressed people with my ability and not shocked them with my incompetence. Can’t believe all the things I managed to get done without meds out of pure grit but damn. I could’ve been light years ahead now. But the past is the past. Upward and onward."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Hell fucking yes. 

I was diagnosed semi-recently at age 38 and am dealing with a lot of anger/grief over how things didn’t need to be as hard as they have been. My career/life is currently in total shambles and I really don’t think I would be here if I had gotten diagnosed and had access to medication starting in high school or even college. I absolutely *killed* myself to reach a high level of success and then burned out before I hit 30. I left my career and now it’s been nearly a decade worth of inconsistent, dead end jobs and lots of unemployment in between. 

I hope I can get back on a better, more sustainable track soon, but wow, I lost a lot crucial career building of time. I’m afraid I’ll never be able to have a family either because I’m now almost 40 and just cannot afford it. It’s so depressing."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","In my early 40's and only started meds a couple years ago (doc (who also had ADHD) who was filling in for my family doc while I was trying to get my anti-derp pills refilled recognized her own people in me), but I suspected since high school that something was amiss... 

In high school my buddy (who was diagnosed as a kid and very clearly had ADHD) told me horror stories about not taking his meds because they made him feel suicidal, so that turned me off truly looking into my suspected ADHD (because I thought medication was the ONLY cure-all) but I wish I would've at least learned about ALL the co-morbidities  and how they were going amplify as I got older... Woulda been nice to not be an ""adult"" who feels like he's always playing catch up in all things adult related 

I imagine life would've been a lot less stressful if I KNEW all the things I know now

Anyone have a time machine handy? I gotta tell my younger self a few tips and tricks, shouldn't need to borrow it for long, couple hours to a few months should be enough time to explain some of it."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Oh Goodness yes. Life would have been so different 😢
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","45, the experience of Ritalin and the peace brought was absolutely shocking (44). No I don't wish anything about the past, it's the past and there's no point wishing you could change things you can't. Also understanding of the condition has massively changed in the last 15 years and treatment has become more widespread. Many of our parents just didn't even have it as a distinction and it only occurred to them as the human condition- also likelihood that parents also are ADHD undiagnosed!  It also means a small dose of Ritalin has a big effect right now as your body has built up tolerance over the years. Honestly my parents knew nothing about it until I educated them on it and lets be honest as a teenager where you communicative enough about the symptoms to anyone that could have made a difference? My main advice for anyone that is unmediated is try every way to build discipline and responsibility for yourself as then not only will you have a more successful life you will also find the medication is more effective and you really appreciate it all the more."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Definitely, it would have literally changed the course of my life"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I blame my parents for lots of other things, but not this because doctors in the 90s would not have had any clue about this kind of diagnosis since they were mostly focused on boys with hyperactivity. But I do look back and I grieve for young me."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",YES. 😓
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes. 

I likely would have focused on school, and started college rather than the military."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I was diagnosed at 37 and I was very sad for a long time knowing that If I had known when I was younger I might have done so much better academically, maybe I wouldn't have destroyed my finances and lost a majority of friends along the way.

I've accepted it now, and I'm happy with what I have today, I struggled to get here and I have done well. But it could have been so so much easier"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Totally... 53 now...and about to go in session and hoppfull get myself diagnosed! Way overdue 🥹
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Well, medication hasn't been successful for me now....

Which has made me wonder.. some of us need to do a few trials of different meds and doses before we can decide on something that works for us. NOT based on how our behavior appears to others but how we feel within us. 

That kind of assessment is not something we can offer confidently as kids, right? Or are kids asked for their inputs on how the meds make them feel?

Changes like losing weight from lack of appetite is obvious, but if it makes them feel sluggish or something else in their head, it can be hard for them to share, or others to notice. Just musing"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes and no. 

Yes, because it definitely would've made life easier, limit my inner critic, and improve my overall life experience. 

No, because although it was challenging, I did enjoy getting to know myself in that way, experience the joy from hacking myself, and leaning into my impulsivity when making certain decisions. 

I was diagnosed last year (I think) and, since joining this sub, have found the answers to my many whys and struggles (insomnia, evening burst of energy, inability to focus on things that are uninspired, able to multitask when inspired, masking, etc)."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Obviously.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Well, I don't like to second. Guess myself. And what I would have done or could have done in nineteen seventy nine I was running late, and I was speeding right in front of the state police post and I did something, and so I got my car searched and I had a whole bunch of criminal stuff in there, and I got charged with a whole bunch of stuff.

Divine Providence. Put me in jail twice. But I didn't do time in a prison 'cause I got really lucky. I don't want to tell you the whole story because it's it was a long time ago.

But I wonder now would I have been such a rebel and a nonconformist, and unable to fit in had, I been medicated earlier.

My father would say to me hit your head against the wall.And when you stop, you're gonna feel better.

I didn't know what he meant.
And I never asked him either.

I was also called a bull in a china shop.

And what those two statements mean is that people like me had been turning up frequently in ancient times and that's how they dealt with it.

The bulll in the china shop is about reacting without thinking. I looked it up just the other day.

And the other one was wisdom about picking my battles. I wanted to fight with everybody and I'm smart, I got a big vocabulary I've been work. I've been reading since I was 5 years old. I read adult books.My parents didn't supervise me very well
I got my first ticket when I was thirteen or fourteen years old.For riding a guy double on my bicycle to junior high school.

And I fought the law a lot. And the law one a lot block I won 2 I got stopped 7 times and got 3 tickets. I talked my way out of four.That ain't bad.

Recently, because I'm too d*** old. To speed anymore, I decided to slow down. I drive slightly over the speed limit and I focus on what I'm doing still I do adhd stuff.

I'm not senile, but I could be demented. And my doctor says I'm getting old 'cause I am old. I'm not a senior citizen anymore. I'm elderly and i'm a member of the silent generation, you can look that up.

And I always get a big kick out of that because i'm not a boomer.

And I'm not silent either. I also have generalized anxiety disorder, and I take medication for that twice a day.

Tonight i'm going to play a game that i've never played before. And it requires a racket, and i'm not gonna buy one. The host already knows I will not be bringing a racket. I went and looked at rackets, and found out that almost everybody has to buy two. Right?Then I didn't like that, so I know the price of two rackets, and if somebody wants to sell me one of their rackets, that they don't use for an amazingly low price of i'm going to be right there.

I just went to a machine yesterday and sold my old cell phone.

So I am filthy rich

You guys have a nice day and take care of yourself and I will take care of myself and take what you like and leave the rest ."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Reading everyone’s replies, I just want to say… as someone who is now 32 sitting on 26 years of diagnosis. Meds don’t help anyone if the people around you are ignorant about adhd. I’ve been on Adderall since kindergarten. I was lucky for one of the girls to get an early diagnosis. But I have no answers and my adhd is just as severe now. Learning about adhd and all the intricacies with it is the only thing that’s been able to help me! I wish you all the best luck in your journeys!"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","42, diagnosed at 39, and have a different take:


I wish I had been diagnosed and medicated at 18, right after graduating HS.  Doing things in 'hard mode' actually instilled me with a valuable work ethic, plus when I was younger I was known as 'weird' and always saying/doing 'random' things (which is true, but not for the reasons everyone assumed at the time).  Had I been medicated from a young age I feel I would have missed out on the theater I did, maybe even the friends I made.  Would I have been more 'productive' and maybe been able to achieve material gains sooner/better/easier?  Sure.  But if I'm being honest with myself and all of you, medication has its side effects, especially in young kids.  My younger brother was actually on Ritalin from an early age, and, yes, he was suddenly able to stand still and pay attention, but he lost a lot of spontaneity and natural curiosity as well.

But after 18, in college and beyond?  Oh *hell* yes, I wish I had had a diagnosis and medication.  Would have helped me so, so much, and I would have probably used that time the way you're supposed to -- getting an idea of your career trajectory and taking first steps to make that happen.  I instead did this in my late twenties / early thirties, and spent a good deal of my mid-thirties struggling to materialize these ambitions.

And am I angry with my parents?  I don't think so.  My younger brother had a much more pronounced case and landed hard on the hyperactive side while I landed on the inattentive side.  Back then, his was easily diagnosed, mine was just ""lazy/careless/stupid"".  They did their best with what the psychiatric movement offered at the time."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I have heard that taking meds young enough can alter your brain positively, to develop with lessened adhd symptoms. I can't find super concrete studies, as it requires a long time period (adolescence to adult) and we don't know if changes are necessarily caused by meds or whatever - but if that's true I would be so mad that I only started at 18! My brain could have been permanently made to be at least a little bit better to deal with 😭"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes. It took me 9 years to get my bachelor's degree. I have flailed and floundered most of my life and hated myself because I thought I was lazy and a bad person. I am now 50 and feel like I wasted my life.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","As someone who was diagnosed at 34 I would also like to submit myself into the ""diagnosed later in life"" committee 😂


Yeah I had a strong suspicion I had it for a long time before seeking treatment, so I went through a lot of the grief before starting treatment (just starting meds this week), but it's very, very real.


For your own sake, I would suggest therapy of some kind to help you work towards acceptance. I hope that doesn't sound trivializing of what you're feeling or working through - it's all entirely valid. But you deserve peace above all else, and having someone who has been through it and/or is properly trained to serve as a guide as you're processing has the potential to really help! And you deserve all the support that you didn't get earlier.


Also, this is so entirely trite to say, but it's genuinely never too late. I have some friends who got a specific masters degree in their 20s in a field I'm interested in, but it felt too late to go back for pre-reqs and then a masters. One of them mentioned someone who was 50 going into that degree with them for an entire career shift! It's a big part of why I pursued getting medicated, because I deserve to have support and that hope, even if it's coming later than I wanted it."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes, but only to know that it wouldn’t work. 

It seems to work amazingly on everyone else, but i honestly don’t see much of a change. It sucks. 

I tried 8 different meds. 

Concerta works the best but not for impulse control or motivation, just emotional disregulation"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I guess I don't?

Not because I think X or Y would have been better, but because the single most constructive thing for ADHD for me is to be accepting of the here and now, and rumination on the past or future yet to occur has only ever been bad for me.

So, I'm where I am! And that's great. 

Who knows if I'd be here with medication and an earlier diagnosis? Maybe yes. Maybe no. But I gotta choose to be happy here."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Diagnosed at 53. Yes, I’ve had some big bouts of grief for the life I could have had, but am still glad at least I’ve gotten to experience the difference even if it’s too late in a lot of ways. It’s also good to have the confirmation that with meds all those things that wrecked my life wouldn’t have happened, because I feel better having a medical explanation for my failures."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I was 38. Knew my brother had it but we believed since I had good grades, I was fine. Glad I was not dxd young. I have an amazing amount of confidence."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","46 just diagnosed with inattentive type. Started meds this month and still fine tuning. Def lived my whole life on hard mode, but had undiagnosed C-PTSD and General Anxiety Disorder too. I also recently learned that I qualified for, but refused gifted services. I've been in weekly therapy for over 2 years now. I am finally starting to feel a sense of peace and confidence in myself that I never knew. My untreated ADHD fueled my anxiety in the form of nonstop racing thoughts and worrying, regardless of anxiety medication. The ability to finally be still in my mind is life altering. Maybe if I had been medicated and treated properly for all of this at a young age, I would have been more at peace, but I'm not sure I would have accomplished all that I have since the drive to be ""enough"" came along with it all. Who knows. Our struggles shape us. I wish you all the best."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Got a diagnosis from a few therapists a few years ago and tried a few meds. Didn’t end up using any of them. I didn’t like the zaps. Knowing I have it makes it easier to navigate. I always had a feeling and I’m glad I wasn’t on medication as a kid. I think it would have squashed some of my creativity.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","If I had had the parental support/attention that would have gotten me a diagnosis I’m not sure I would have needed it.  As a child, to have guidance, reminders, learned accountability instead of consequences- I would have ruled the world."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes. Omg if my adhd and anxiety were diagnosed as a child, I feel my life would have been so much easier!! I was diagnosed at 35 (39 now) and just recently got on meds. Life changing."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yeah pretty sure we all felt/feel what you do.

"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I was about 28, but I am 32 now. Close enough to the age range. I was mad at first. After working through that I tried to find some of the positives. What if is not a great feeling. 

I cannot change my past, only my present."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yep. After a late night heart-to-heart with my dad a few years ago, he revealed he had been diagnosed as an adult and had been on meds for decades. I wish he had told me when I was younger. I dropped out of grad school in my 20s because I couldn’t white-knuckle it anymore. I’m back in school now and medicated and it’s still hard but not impossible. I can’t help but wonder if I would have been able to finish my first degree had I gotten the right diagnosis and treatment. (I did CBT for Generalized Anxiety Disorder while in grad school #1: it helped a little, but i understand now that my anxiety was a symptom of having ADHD in academia, not the root cause.) "
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Tbh the medication would have probably been helpful, but more so, an earlier diagnosis would have given me a model for what habits and strategies work for me. It might have saved me the pain of being cast as “unfocused”, “uncommitted”, “forgetful”, “unreliable”, “disobedient”, and “hard to relate to” - characterizations that have stuck with me in my family even after diagnosis. Plus, having an understanding of the… special experience that is Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria has made huge changes in how I understand my interpersonal relationships (and past decisions about them.) A diagnosis isn’t necessarily about finding a cure or solution to a “problem”; sometimes it’s about having a better understanding of the system altogether."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Nope.

Never found the point of longing for something that I didn't have. Seems like a waste of energy to wallow in something beyond my control. Especially seems like a bad vibe to spit on the life that I've lived as if it wasn't a gift in and of itself. Even on meds, I still take residence in my own mind, and I think we could all do better to make it a kinder place.

I think that attempting to fit into society's definition of ""normal"" or ""competent"" has caused scores more damage to my life than ADHD ever could. Instead, I focus on the present and the future. Both are ill-defined and boundless, just like me."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes. It sort of almost killed me after my life completely derailed, starting with dropping out of college. The first time."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","100%! I would be way ahead in my career compared to where I am and knowing what was going on with my brain and way I was different I think would’ve also been really helpful, instead of becoming depressed that I wasn’t good enough, smart enough, etc. I would’ve been able to be solution oriented.

I was diagnosed at 35 and am now 37 and started seeing a psychiatrist more than 20 years ago. The thing that really bothers me is why didn’t he suspect it could have been ADHD at the time, he only asked me about my childhood in a really vague way and of course I thought it was normal because I didn’t know anything else. I’ve been labeled with depression, anxiety, and even Borderline Personality Disorder… and while I had some depression and anxiety a bit in the past as a result of struggling with ADHD, the main diagnosis was totally missed. The only reason they had assumed Borderline was the emotional regulation difficulties, but they didn’t even ask me any questions to rule out ADHD at the time. I was trying to get help, going to psychiatrists and psychologists, taking my meds, doing group therapy, etc. and nothing helped, all because nobody asked me the right questions."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Not diagnosed over the age of 35 but diagnosed at 31. I was angry, but not at my parents. It’s really only become better known what the symptoms are in women in the last ten-ish years, and a LOT was unknown about inattentive ADHD, of which I am predominantly. I was mostly angry that I had shamed myself and beat myself up for so long about things I thought were “character flaws” and that my self esteem had taken such hits over the years because of the way I spoke to myself."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes. I would have lived with a lot less self hatred and exasperation.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Glad I wasn't on medication but also not glad. It's hard to explain.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Diagnosed early 10-12 with bi-polar disorder, anxiety, depression. Was a very emotionally disturbed kid, didn't fit or want to fit into any molds. I remember having full blown panic attacks at the thought of doing math homework. Very disruptive in class in my middle school years. College reading level in grade 2, did nothing but read books until middle school, to the detriment of all other things. Heavily medicated for those things until my late teens. Stopped taking meds when I moved out. No bi-polar, just continuing anxiety and depression. Now 37 diagnosed last year, started meds and WOW. Life is a lot easier when you can pick one thought out of the Maelstrom and follow it to conclusion. I don't hold any resentment towards the doctors and parents, I was a wild and emotional child. They did the best they could with the knowledge at the time. My life has been a whirlwind of addiction and impulsiveness, until now. I wish i was on meds at an earlier age, but also not, Im sure I would have abused them in my earlier life. I feel like I can finally adult now."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Sure. I wish I had been diagnosed and on meds younger. But I'm not mad at my parents about it. They didn't know what they didn't know. 

Also, my mom and many aunts and uncles on both sides of my family are ADHD, either undiagnosed or diagnosed later in life, so many of my ""symptoms"" just seemed normal to my family. 

However, I also have cousins who were diagnosed and put on meds as kids and some of them are mad at their parents for that. As kids it was harder to advocate for themselves about something they didn't know about. So a few were unintentionally over-medicated to help with the outward symptoms their parents could see, which basically numbed them or made them feel like zombies. So now they blame their parents and refuse to try meds as adults because of the bad experience when younger, even though the right med at a proper dose would probably be beneficial to them as adults.

So I'd try not to be too mad at your parents, over that at least.  If they had known and had put you on meds as a kid and you were accidentally over-medicated, you might have an aversion to them and not be experiencing the benefits now as an adult. You never know. I'd just try to focus on now and the future. It's not too late to take some classes or go to school if you really want to. I went to school and got a degree in my 30s, before I was ever diagnosed."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","i think pretty much all of us later-diagnosis adults feel this way. 

my first day on meds, i cried and cried and cried. i still think about years of zombie life before meds and what it could have been like if i had any idea inattentive adhd was a thing"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",1000% yes. I’m still mad about it.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Definitely. Every challenging thing in my life and my relationships was directly related to my undiagnosed and un-medicated ADHD.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I was diagnosed at 37. Despite my ADHD, I managed to graduate university and build a great career. At the cost of my mental health. I was diagnosed with severe OCD at 28, which I now look back and think that could have been there to overcorrect my adhd behaviours. I’ve battled depression, anxiety and my self esteem has always been very low. I never understood why everything seemed so much harder for me. Along with my adhd diagnosis and medication, came the opportunity to look back and realize how much harder life was for me. Unnecessarily. I would give anything to have been diagnosed as a child or even in high school."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Absolutely.   I knew something was wrong but I didn't know what.  My educators were absolutely no help at all.  If I'd been medicated and a therapist explained ADHD to me I think I would have been able to make so much more progress.   I would have hated myself a lot less too.  Finding out later is better than never finding out at all, but at this point I don't have the drive to make significant changes in my life.  The meds don't make much difference for me now."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Absolutely. I'm 33F and was diagnosed early this year. I don't blame my mom. My brother is severely ADHD and since girls and boys present differently, she just didn't know that I also had it. She also just realized that she also has it. If it had been addressed when I was young, especially in high school, my life could be completely different, but it is what it is. I unfortunately haven't found the right medication, but I'm really excited to finally find it."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",I wasn't diagnosed until just before 40. I feel that my entire life would have been different had I gotten the help that I needed. 
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",I was 34. Absolutely. I’m fairly certain it would have saved me a lot of self-inflicted trauma.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes. I think my parents just assumed my inability to pay attention and forgetfulness was a normal kid thing. I'm the eldest child so they didn't have any practice with other kids yet.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","So I was diagnosed as an adult & finally sought medication in my 40’s. Your question is hard to answer because I didn’t know at a younger age that I was “different”. I suspected there was something different about OTHER people, but I couldn’t put my finger on it. I struggled to make friends as a kid because I couldn’t stay focused on the usual group activities long enough, so I’d get bored & drift away. In school I was smart enough to coast along & get “B” average grades without having to work for them. I often didn’t understand why it took others so long to reach the conclusions I had reached some time ago - yep, I became arrogant & that put people off. Back to your question: would I have done anything different ? TBH - I don’t think so. Again, I didn’t realize or recognize I was different. I learned my own coping mechanisms for dealing with education, whether writing everything down, or using everything/anything as a whiteboard. LOL - I learned I needed to block print my notes in university because a month after writing something in cursive I couldn’t read my own (sloppy) hand-writing ! Here I am now, adulting, medicated, married & in a reasonably successful career. Would I go back and change anything ? Probably not. Those are my $0.02, YMMV.."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I was diagnosed at 31, 37 now. Knowing about this when I was a child absolutely would have changed things - not just in terms of meds, but just the entire understanding of why I am the way I am, my social difficulties, the best ways for me to learn, do things, function, etc. 

It's normal to go through a period of grief and anger. Try not to be too hard on your parents - when we were kids, the general understanding of ADHD was still pretty narrow. If you didn't present as a hyperactive little boy who was *also* failing classes, people didn't think of it. And frankly, at least one of your parents probably has it too and never realized, because it just wasn't on the radar when they were growing up. 

In the end, we can't change the past, we can only work with what we have today. I'm at least happy that from what I've seen, kids growing up today are getting far better treatment and support than even the diagnosed kids were getting back in the 90s."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I think relationships would have suffered less, but my career wouldn’t be nearly as creative and flourishing in the way it is now. I’m selfishly kind of grateful for that, but happy to have the resources I have now to lead a happy and stable life for my loved ones’ sake, as well as mine"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I'm still not on meds(I hate doctors), and I wish all the time that I had been on them all these years. I've always felt like I wasted all my talents. Could have been far more successful had I been able to do the things I wanted to do. 

I don't blame anyone though. My parents (and me for that matter) never knew anything was wrong. Or at least just didn't know enough about ADHD to realize that was the problem."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes

As a late diagnosed, after spending a year finding meds that work, now I have to unlearn 30 years of coping mechanisms and then build healthier responses."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","TL;DR - Not without therapy and ADHD education sessions for the parents and child first. Meds aren't a cure-all. 

I was diagnosed by my brain doctor at 38, but none of the meds have done any good for me thus far. I was on Strattera, Wellbutrin, XR Adderall, and most recent, Clonidine. I just weaned myself off of that after several months of trying to feel something from it.

I was on 25Mg XR Adderall for a couple of months but felt nothing. Not even negative side-effects when I went for broke and took two. I had taken regular Adderall once before about 15 years ago and had a bit too much, I think, but I recall it fondly. I felt clear. However, I had been drinking heavily at that time as well, so that also has an impact on the experience.

My longtime friend who played with Adderall in the amateur market felt that the XR was the issue and that I would have better results from the regular. However, my brain doctor said they didn't use regular for adults. IDK, I find it hard to discuss those types of drugs with my doctor because it's such an abused market. 

Since they didn't have an option for regular Adderall, I asked for something different and got Clonidine. It was upped to 3x daily, but it still gave me no changes. I've been off it a few weeks, and if anything, I feel better and clearer. 

40 now, diagnosed with what was then Aspergers at around age 9. Always felt off and different. My outward presenting stims and self soothes were seen as repetitive and fidgety, so they were...firmly squashed by my mother. Spent a lot of time inside my head, and my parents had a 7-8 year-long drawnout and hella messy divorce that started at age 7 as well. I was also the victim of SA by several family members as before age 7. I only remember the most recent person. Smoothed over by family, and this person still is a part of get togethers. Trauma story for another time, I guess.

I spent a lot of time in therapy, stopped drinking (2 years this past July 4th), dug up a bunch of trauma, and stated clearing my mental plate. My therapist and physician both agreed that ADHD testing would be a logical move forward given my shadow work and relative upward movements. So my physician sent me to my brain doctor, an ADHD specialist, apparently, and I was diagnosed among one of the first couple sessions. Queue medication list above. 

I had and have a strong desire to do what I could do without meds for most things. I won't go to extremes, but the more I can handle without help makes me feel better. Probably trauma of never being able to rely on folks. My brain doctors office feels like a pill mill and throwing darts at prescriptions, so that doesn't help me feel any better when it comes to getting behind a medication. 

So, I guess my answer would be not without first having some therapy to help them learn to live with ADHD. And education for the parents too. I think a lot of parents don't want to have to deal with a child that is outside the box, so they medicate them. Many diagnosed people just want to take something to avoid having to take any personal action or accountability. I feel the diagnosis allows for the chance to move forward with the knowledge of what's unique about you and what you can now do to help make your life more purposeful. I see a lot of folks using their diagnosis as a reason to not try or not improve, and I feel that's not the healthy way to go about it. Meds for adults can help make therapy and shadow work happen in the first place, but it's easy to rely solely on that crutch. 

It's definitely a hard path to navigate safely and without gaining a debilitating addiction."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yeah you're never going to feel completely better about your parents. You'll feel angry less often eventually. If your parents were doing their best and all, trying but genuinely didn't understand, etc, that can be a relief. Eventually you might see they were trying with the information they had at the time. Some folks can't say that of their folks, I hope you can. 

Also it's primarily genetic, so most people's parents were struggling themselves."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","You can't really blame your parents. Our understanding of ADHD is still fairly new.

I was initially angry at my parents because they never took me to see a doctor about it, but then I realized there was even less information when I was a child regarding it (I am now 55).

The only part that bothered me was when they ridiculed me for being lazy, unmotivated, or lacking willpower, but they were brought up in a world where ADHD ""didn't exist"" and people with it were treated even worse than we were. Add to that the fact that for some parents to believe that their child had ADHD, AuADHD, or some other mental health affliction, it may mean that they had it too, which, for some, would be a hard pill to swallow, so, I forgave them. 

After the passing of my parents, I realized that several of my family members had it, including my father, my uncle, my aunt, and my grandmother. On my mother's side, I didn't know her parents well, as her mom died at a young age, and her father was estranged, but I believe that she was on the spectrum. 

That being said, I would have loved to have been diagnosed when I was younger, but it is what it is, and all I can do now is try to remove the stigma that still remains out there regarding it and other mental health issues."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Diagnosed at 63 here.   
Seconding all the other posts on this page."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I feel like my life would’ve been completely different. I think if I was medicated during college/end of hs, I’d have a degree, more money, better (paying) job, etc. But I’m a girl and I just ran my mouth, wasn’t hyperactive enough to get noticed"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I was diagnosed at 25 and the person testing me was shocked I had never been tested before and also somehow managed to graduate college. I have pretty severe ADHD. 
I used to be angry at my parents and doctors, but"

"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","It's hard to say because I just started medication on a very low dose and haven't noticed a difference yet. Assuming it does eventually help me, I do wish I could've tried it in high school. Hell, if I could've just had coffee in high school it would've changed my life (I was Mormon so I wasn't allowed to drink coffee, plus I was taking a 6 AM religion class every day -- that combination was really detrimental to my schooling). I really couldnt focus on things I didn't interest me like math and science. I was excellent at English, music, and languages, because those were natural gifts that I had. 

It was only recently that I learned that ADHD can show up as a disinterest in certain subjects thus an inability to focus on them. I'm pretty sure that was happening with me when it came to math. Like yeah, I also just don't consider myself that good at it, but generally I just tune out and don't see the point, except for a few practical applications. 

Funny enough though, I got good grades in most subjects, even with balancing tons of extracurriculars. I do think one of the superpowers of ADHD is being able to bounce between hobbies and passions, and almost preferring to function that way. So if I had not had ADHD I probably would have focused more on school. But my extracurriculars are what got me the friendships I have today and brought the most joy into my life."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Discovered I was ADHD when I was 24, diagnosed at 28. I absolutely feel things could have been different and I might have struggled a whole lot less in my youth if I had medication.

That being said, I like who I am and my experiences made me who I am, so while I work hard to make sure others aren't forced through my same situation I would not go back and change my life if I was offered a time machine to do so."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Holy shit yes!
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Abso-fucking-lutely I wish I had been diagnosed and medicated as a kid.  I got diagnosed 2 years ago at 36 (I’m also like somewhere between 90 and 95% sure I’m autistic as well) and went through the whole grieving process for what is, was and could have been and I just got through that. I was so happy once I got my diagnosis that finally there is a bit of hope that I’ll be able to not waste the next 36 years of my life. It lasted for a bit and then I went down that grieving path to get to acceptance - the medication has helped me with emotionally processing all of that. It took longer than I expected and I had to tear down the massive wall I had built up for like 30 years to protect myself but had the unintentional and exact opposite effect. This has only been over the last 6 weeks and the amount of tears I have cried is crazy but worth it. Still getting used to being as sensitive and emotional as I am and not blocking them out or pushing them down for the comfort of others. I’m so fucking done with that.

Anyway, yes I would’ve loved yo have the diagnosis and meds waaaayyyy sooner but there’s no point in thinking about what could have been because I can’t change that and it will only turn me into an embittered almost middle aged man."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes, I really wish I was diagnosed at 7 years instead of 55 years."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I dont blame my parents


And no, I dont wish I had discovered it earlier. Sadly I dont tolerate well the meds anyway, so it wouldn't have made that much of a difference, except in the ""know yourself department"" but I would probably have been too young to understand it anyway"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I have extremely severe ADHD and was not diagnosed until 17, despite doctors begging my parents. I am still mad at my them for forcing me to almost drop out of high school all while telling me I ""just needed to try harder"". 


My partner wasn't diagnosed and I started studying ADHD in college. I watched them suffer for a bit and finally just started begging them to get diagnosed. They have the same anger towards their parents. 


We have agreed that we are also both very likely autistic and that it likely mitigated symtpoms in that we both had school as a special interest. 


I'm infuriated for all of you. I hate that parents say ""my child doesn't need a crutch"". Okay, you're making them walk around on a broken leg then? Telling them that they're not good enough because they can't run like everyone else when they insist that they cannot? Great parenting. 


The genetic component plays an interesting part in this. Many parents experience the same symptoms because ADHD is incredibly genetic, and as is common in older generations especially, many of them have an ""I struggled, so you should have to/can too"" mentality. I've also heard a lot of parents say ""you don't have ADHD because I experience it in the same way""."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Life happens for us, not to us. I’m happy I wasn’t diagnosed early. I’m not sure I’d be as wildly successful as I am, had I been put on drugs."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Definitely. I would be a completely different person living a completely different life if I’d known and had been able to get on meds. 

I’m angry that not one teacher that saw my issues with dyscalculia, who sent home those “so smart but doesn’t focus” messages managed to not say anything of substance to my parents. 

I’m mad that my mom, who suffered from anxiety herself (and most likely ADHD) and had a son with ADHD, just decided to ignore any issues she saw that I had when I was younger. I’m mad that she didn’t believe me in my late 40s when I said I had ADHD and other comorbidities . I’m angry that she passed away before I got my diagnosis so I could say SEE. 

I’m just really angry."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",I’m only 30 but dear god yes I wish I had been
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Absolutely. I was dx last year at 36. Unfortunately I have yet to find a medication that I can tolerate enough to see if it works. I just want to finish a thought 😭
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","100% yes, just started taking meds a couple of months ago at age 55, what a difference it's made.  Looking back on my life I would've accomplished so much more than I have."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I was diagnosed 2 years ago at 33. Although I wish I knew sooner for obvious reasons that have been stayed by others,  I am glad I waited to get medicated because I was able to develop coping/masking skills that I can fall back on whenever access to medication gets funny"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Late to the comments, but I feel your anger. I went through it too all the dreams that you had and The would’ve could’ve should’ve.

My doctor too was like so. You never went to the doctor until you met your husband and I was like yeah that’s correct. 

My parents took me to the health department to get my shots..as a kid."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","ADHD was and still is a taboo subject among the older generations. I haven’t told my family that I’m diagnosed and taking medication. 

Since turning 30 several years ago, I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD, sleep apnea, diverticulosis, and a slew of other minor issues.

I had my tonsils out last year. I probably should have had it done as a kid. That plus getting on ADHD meds has been life changing."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Absolutely yes. But I am just relieved that I can now actively work around it. I am 39 now. Diagnosed a few months back.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes I could have avoided a lot of negative things that happened. For example, I could have done better when I tried going to university. I could have accomplished a lot more. But it still isn't too late. It is never too late."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I was diagnosed at 25, right before losing my job, and as my fellow Gringos understand, treatment was delayed a while. Its been on and off since. I'm employed now, but my budget is too tight for treatment, so I'm managing as best I can using meds sparingly."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Very much so. So much would have been different. Not everything, I'd still have had ADHD, but a lot"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I don't wish it, since I probably never would have met my wife or had my kids. But I can see in hindsight that it would have been the right move at the time."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I got diagnosed in February at 36. I am lucky to have gotten a great job in a good career last fall and to have worked to the point that my only debt is a mortgage now, but I did everything on hard mode. I am the eldest daughter in an immigrant family and the number of times I got the ""laziness/wasting your potential"" message, even from a place of love was awful. I struggled so much for so long in my teens and 20s and internalized a lot of negativity about myself even while I was working to sort my life out. 

Since there are no time machines and I'm in a good place, I try to be gracious to my younger self who somehow got here despite my brain, my parents who were working too hard in a new country with four kids to care about ADHD even though they loved us so much, and honestly, my brain for making me inquisitive, empathetic, creative, and a menace at trivia."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Diagnosed almost 20 years ago at 35 and the answer is ""Hell yes""
That said, when I was a hyper kid, ADHD didn't technically exist and support for adults was non-existent. Meds and treatment have improved a lot since then, so I'm not sure how helpful it would have been."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","42 and diagnosed this year.
Meds to help for work, yes, but it's not that they changed my life, honestly.
That said, yes, I would have loved to have them while studying, albeit I wonder how much boost they would have given me."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I know this feeling well.  I had the same feelings at first.  Sometimes I still wonder.

I have to temper that wishfulness though because it comes off as an indictment of my parents.  I can only speak for myself and not your situation.  My parents wouldn't have even thought of ADHD.  The popular image of ADHD wasn't me.  There was a huge stigma in the late 80s/early 90s about medicating children.  They had seen my first cousin's situation and believed that his mother was medicating him unnecessarily, so they even saw medication as sinister.  

I also wondered how different my life could have been.  I don't even want to list the litany of things that changed about my life once I was on medication (also at 39/40).  There are many variables to consider though.  Would I have turned into a confident, athletic go-getter with friends who didn't end up dropping out, institutionalized, or in rehab?  I don't know.  Would I have floundered in the military for 20 years? I don't know.

What do I have more certainty of? Would ADHD meds have compensated for the deficits I had because my neglectful and alcoholic father? No.  Would it have made me heterosexual? Definitely not.  Would it have made me amenable to conformity at our fundamentalist church? Would I have been able to have related to other kids and been more of a normie?  No and doubtful.

All I have is now.  Even if there were a chance of ""redemption"" I'm not sure that I would want to relive my youth in order to find out.  I hope that in time you will be able to reframe your experience in a way that gives you some peace.  Otherwise, you might rob yourself of your newfound life from your medication."

"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Wow. I’m finding so hard not to dwell on the what could have beens and the cringe moments.

"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes. Even if I probably wouldn’t have taken it everyday I would have loved to have the medication for the worse days.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I was diagnosed last week, and I'm starting Strattera today. I'm 37, and deep down, I feel like I knew something was off for the last 10 years of my life. I despise the labels I carried and still carry for all these years - being too difficult, too loud, too angry, too passionate, and too much of so many things. I wish life would have been different in so many ways, so I don't blame anyone, but I certainly mourn."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I got diagnosed at the same age, I am surprised looking back all the things I managed to do without medication, but yeah I wish i got my diagnosis in my mid 20s"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes!! Would have been a billionaire by now with the effort I put in just be a 6-figureaire…. Taking meds is like turning on god mode….I’m unstoppable for the next 8 to 12 hours lmao

"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yeah, when i first started on medication it was indescribable but also rather overwhelming and i thought to myself ""is this how normal people feel?"" I could be annoyed at my grandparents for not noticing when i was young but any education in the UK in the 90's weren't equipped or knowledgeable at the time so i had to make my own peace that way."

"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes.

However, I don't blame my parents.
First off, I'm a woman, and as we all know NOW is that adhd often, not always, but often, presents differently in girls than in boys. 

I was shy, quiet, sensitive (like I cried almost everydaynin school when the boys teased me or when I got angry, and they of course found it even funnier so that kept on), I daydreamed alot and later, as I grew older, my grades was just below average, I didn't struggle hard, I was floating by, except for math. That was hard. 

And I could never score well on tests, but give me a creative assignement or an essay to write and I mostly did well.

No teacher picked up on my Inattentive Adhd either, because I believe it wasn't thqt far studied on, and as we've heard time and time again, Adhd was mainly studied on boys, boys who acted outwards.

Anyway, I digress, I was diagnosed 2 years ago, at 38 years old.
Today we have all kinds of information  at our fingertips, it's easier for us today to find out what something might be, when we find something avout ourseöves thqt may be wrong (pain, incessive cough etc etc) and then once we've found out wha tit might be, we can take it to the next step and ask for an evalution, this was not so simple 30 years ago.

I try not to think too much about it, though I do believe thqt my life could've turned out much differently IF I had been diagnosed earlier, not even needed to be as a child but maybe young adult...Cause, adult life is the worst when you need to keep yourself accountable, and somehow also make a living while you also try to keep yourself together...

Right now, I have medication and the biggest change it has done for me, is to keep me awake and alert at my job, I don't feel like it is useless and a drag anymore, and I don't feel constantly tired. 
But there are other aspects that the medication can't help.much with, things that I need to force myself to do, or have help from others (body-doubling)."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I try not to think about that, it’s the top question in my head"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Hell yeah
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Diagnosed right about 35. More than meds, I wish I woulda just known. Spent most of my life thinking I was just a colossal screw up, juxtaposed with being one of the hardest working and most capable people I know. 

Don't get me wrong, the meds are a godsend, there's a good chance I woulda had to quit my job without them.

 But they don't fix everything. And they certainly do very little to address the negative self talk I developed, to make sense of my unconventional patterns.

If I could send anything back to younger me, it would be a big bundle of the ""not everyone struggles with this as much as you do,"" ""it's not your fault,there's a reason you're like this "" and "" don't measure yourself against everyone else"" thoughts, rather than the meds."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes, I could have achieved a lot more earlier on. I wish I had my emotional development to go with it too, that came from therapy later in life and would have had me choose the right people in my life and be happier earlier.

Saying that, my late diagnosis and troubles I've been through in life have lead me to where I am, who I'm with and what I have today, which I wouldn't trade."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",My life wasn’t hard by any means but it could have been SO much easier.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I’m 39 and diagnosed at 37. I would have mainly wished to have been diagnosed earlier, I would have been far more forgiving to myself over the years had I known my shortcomings/strengths and how to work with them rather than against. 

I would have tried medication for sure, but I think a diagnosis in primary school or earlier would have been more than half the battle, at least in regard to my sense of self in the many years that followed."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes. It would have solved a lot of needless suffering and helped me make better decisions and set myself up for more success, sooner."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","100% yes. 


That AND that society was more understanding of mental health and invisible disabilities, but if I have to pick one, I'll take meds/techniques earlier. 

If only to help me navigate that alone instead of a compounding thing to tackle, added to the daunting list of adulting items."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Of course duh😭
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","… this really helps. I’m not (>35) but it helps to know that no matter when in life it gets done, it still helps, I’m looking forward to finally getting diagnosed."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I was just diagnosed at 39 too and will be on medication soon. Did you feel like this before you took medication? I can already feel that anger at the adults who should have spotted this as a child, and I'm sort of waiting for that ""emotional first day on drugs"" experience you describe where it all becomes very real and reality hits as to what you've really missed out on."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",100%. I was diagnosed at 40. My childhood was hell between school and my home life. Being medicated would have made a huge difference in my quality of life.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","34, so just shy of your age bracket. But yes, I was diagnosed 1 year ago, wish I was diagnosed and had help with this 2 decades ago."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","No. Actually Yes. On second thought, maybe."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I haven't had medication, so I'm biased. But I am currently glad that I learned to function without it, because I see other people with ADHD whose lives go crazy when they don't get their prescription filled. I'm not saying that I won't get medicated in the future either; it just seems like having the experience of suffering this way will make it easier to survive issues in the future when they come up."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Don’t be angry for what you can’t change be grateful for what you can


You sorted it out, job well done. You deserve to be happy"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes. I can only speculate how different my life would have been had I been properly diagnosed and medicated when I was younger.

My life is in an OK place right now, but getting proper care and support would have prevented at least some of the problems I've had."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Absolutely yes.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Hard to say but I likely would have not dropped out of Law School. No regrets however I do know that things would have been different but not necessarily better or worse.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Don't blame your parents if they simply didn't know.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","i had such severe adhd that my school insisted i get tested (which was rare for girls back then) and i scored the lowest my psychologist had ever seen at the time. i feel like those are the cases that were recognized back then and the disorder itself wasn’t fully understood or researched (still isn’t). 

but from my understanding - being diagnosed later in life usually has a mourning period. you have to grieve who you could have been if your parents took the time and invested in getting you assessed, medicated (if need be) and accommodated. it can be quite sad. we have to remember a lot of neurodevelopmental disorders are genetic so parents often don’t think their child is struggling with anything because it’s all they’ve known as well.

i will say that the research back then was sexist, and ablist. when i was a child, you could only be diagnosed with one neurodevelopmental disorder. they didn’t believe one could have adhd AND autism for example. they wouldn’t even bother checking once you had one diagnosis. once i was diagnosed, any and every symptom or struggle of mine was immediately viewed as a side effect of my meds. my anxiety, ocd and depression weren’t even acknowledged or addressed. 

just know that it’s never too late! you can always go back to school and invest in yourself! and know that you’re valid in feeling upset over this!"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I'm not sure about medication, but I definitely wish I'd been diagnosed and been given some organization/studying strategies to help. (I'm not sure they would have given that in the 90s without requiring me on meds first.)"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I figured out I had it and OCPD at 21 years old, and I only found out because all of the issues I was ignoring + some familial neglect came back to bite me in the ass for the worst 4 year long depression I've ever had, ruining my college experience. So I can't imagine finding out at 35"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Like a lot of people, I had a mourning period. I was diagnosed at 30. I had failed so many projects, fired from a couple jobs because of stupid mistakes and judgements. I was depressed and suicidal.

But then, where I am now, my current lot.... Would have been vastly different if I had been medicated from the get go. Would it have been better? Maybe. Different, yes. But I like where I am now. I have a decent job with good co-workers. I have a loving soon to be (2 weeks!) husband. I'm actually working hard on a project in my spare time that I've been working on for a year, and expect to take *ten years* to finish. 



I don't think I would have met my partner if I'd had a different path in life. I wouldn't be in this exact place with friends and family I love. 

So yes, it would have been nice to have been diagnosed sooner. But I like what I have now, so I don't regret it."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes, I sometimes wish I'd been diagnosed and medicated in undergrad. It would have changed my career path completely. I often went the path of least resistance because I had no idea how to set goals or build things up incrementally. If something was challenging, I just stopped doing it. I feel like I squandered my time at university.

Diagnosed at 32; will be 35 soon."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","It would've been nice to have had the option, just to see what impact it would have had on my younger self."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes.  Would have cut my coffee bill enormously.

I didn't feel anger torward my parents for this. ADHD wasn't a diagnosis back then.  I do feel anger about he neglect and abuse."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","If not medication, just knowing why my brain was doing what it was doing would have been huge."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Uh yeah.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes. It could have changed my entire life. I was angry for a while to be honest, but I understand it wasn’t well known, accepted, or understood much back then. We all just thought ADHD = hyper boys. 

Still.. probably would have amounted to a lot more in life had I had been validated, medicated, and educated in those developmental years."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Would have been nice to have been diagnosed and medicated so I didn't have to be an alcoholic for 2 decades.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",I could have finished my 2 year degree in 2 years instead 12!
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes, 100%!"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes, feel like I missed making so many memories as I’m really in the moment now."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Not diagnosed until 61. I was peculiar but lack of meds was not a problem until I got ex military boss
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",I’m not sure. I say that coming from having the privilege of many conditions that benefited me. How severe my adhd would’ve been without them I’m not sure. Too many to list them all but: homeschooled for middle school so one on one attention and untraditional schedule where I could learn anywhere with any accommodations and as many breaks as necessary. Both parents had some kind of adhd and/or autism so they just thought I was not out of the ordinary and didn’t get much negative feedback growing up. Etc etc. I benefited in my environment from being able to grow some skills without meds but the downside is some of my reliance was on my anxiety. Also I dipped into depression when I went back to school and realized I was not “normal” and ended up being bullied. I wasn’t sure why I wasn’t accepted or how I was different just that everyone else seemed to have a script or set of rules I didn’t beyond socialization stuff with homeschooling. I know meds would’ve helped my anxiety and depression. But everything I went through helped me in one way or another. Im conflicted.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","For me, it wasn’t so much for the medication as it was an explanation and vindication. The thought and feeling that you could partially forgive yourself for the years and years of being told that you weren’t putting in enough effort and thought yourself as lazy."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",100 percent I do ! I just wish I’d known what was going on in my head. And meds would have absolutely helped.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes. All of the yeses.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I was diagnose in 40s , but there’s the rub…. I was actually diagnosed like 7/8 but
My mom did let me get medication bc I would end up addicted and her cult said it’s the demon of mental illness 😖 🤦🏻‍♀️"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Simple answer to your title question: yes!
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I wish I was diagnosed before college. I got straight As in the classes I loved and Bs and Cs in my other classes. I had the whole ""you're lazy"" syndrome going on."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","This was my experience when I started concertta. But now, after few weeks, I would say no. My life was amazing, I’ve lived in 8 countries and even tho it was not easy, it was fun and I learned so much. I don’t want to think about the past, I can’t change it."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Depends on how much younger. 
If I would have been diagnosed as a child, it would have been extremely shameful on me and my entire family as I grew up in a conservative evangelical Christian home where mental health was never considered as an option.   I don’t think my parents would haven given me the option to even take meds for a mental health disorder.  Or if I had been on meds, living with the shame of a ‘mental health disorder’ would have induced a whole new trauma. 

In my 30s and now in my 40s, then yes, I would have wanted to be on meds.  I had now become much more self aware that maybe my brain is not normal, yes, I would have been able to save some turmoil in the past decade."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yep. Not sure the meds that were available when I was a teen would’ve worked but I would’ve liked a chance.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","First I thought it but then, I remember I went through lots of negative experiences and learn what I don’t want so I know clearly what I want. It made me stronger and also, I am happy where I am on my path."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes ...my life and career and (past) marriage would had been very different...and better
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I was diagnosed nearly 2 years ago at 29 and I grieved for the life I might’ve had if my ADHD had been diagnosed sooner. I also feel like my mental health might not have ended up in such a dark place as I wouldn’t have had certain negative thoughts about myself that being undiagnosed brought about. I also grieve for the effect being undiagnosed had on relationships with my family, my dad in particular, and I feel that some of those scars now run too deep to ever get back to a tension-free relationship.

I was showing clear signs of ADHD from 5 or 6 years old, maybe even earlier, but it was just deemed to be a difficult stage because I didn’t like my teacher and nothing was ever investigated, especially since, back then, they thought only boys could have ADHD. It’s made me feel a lot of resentment for those around me who **could have** and **should have** pushed more to get to the bottom of my behaviour"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes! I try to not look back at regrets or wasted time as life has been pretty good but the suffering was another level. Particularly late teens/early twenties. I also wish GP’s at that time could have been more thorough
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",i was diagnosed at a young age but my parents chose not to medicate and i really really wish they had because now its borderline impossible for me to get medication and i think a lot of my life so far would have likely turned out different than it has
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I haven't even gotten to try meds yet, but just knowing \*why\* I had certain behaviours, or \*why\* I was predisposed to addiction, honestly would have help me develop better coping mechanisms far sooner than I did."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes, my whole life would've looked different. I was in the dark for almost 37 years before I got diagnosed a few months ago. My son is being screened as well. I will NOT let him go through life feeling like I did. He's on the spectrum and takes zoloft for anxiety and depression, but I'm thinking there's overlap. Because I struggled terribly, I do everything I can for my sons mental health and my own."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Omg yes
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes I lost my job my wife and life due to ADHD wish I would have been medicated years ago.. Getting back on track now
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",I just wish I knew I wasn’t crazy.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Dude. At this point to be honest. 

I sit next to my wife, holding her hands and I’m thinking that I need to end it.

Many docs said I can never become the musician I want to be, because I can’t study to the point of my ambitions. I can’t develop the habit of working out. Poor social skills, high anxiety. So much has been robed from me by non medicated adhd.  

I’m on burn out from work right now so it’s easy to list only the bad things and stay negative. However I’m doing the work and seeing specialists. But my heart is giving up ever so slowly which I told one of them."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Absolutely 100%. Life would have been vastly better.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",yes. the earlier the better.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Absolutely. I struggled with terrible anxiety all of my life, but once I was diagnosed and put on meds, my anxiety improved so much. I also have bipolar disorder, and although my bipolar has remained the same, I feel so much better without the weight of all of that anxiety."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","In a strange way......no.  I feel that I was very immature and wreckless as it was.  If I would have received treatment then.....although it would have helped me I feel I would not be as humble as I am now.  Power and knowledge can corrupt so to speak.  Pride comes before the fall.


I also have had some powerful encounters with the LORD Jesus that have really shaped and changed me. Not looking to argue over this but making a sincere statement.


If this medication continues to improve my performance and such then I also need to remember where I was and how hopeless I felt when I see others struggling or they need a hand to reach out and pull them up with kindness, patience and understanding."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Pretty sure my life would look a lottttt different if I had been. Diagnosed at 33.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Diagnosed and medicated at 33.

Goddamn I did undergrad and grad on hard mode. I could have done so much better as an undergrad, and only got through grad school by being in perpetual panic mode.

Would not have had the reputation for being a space cadet for so much of my life."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","My anxiety and depression had bigger effects on me until I got into college. I would have loved to be diagnosed instead of being told to calm down. Once I got my depression wrangled, the adhd/audhd reared its head and caused trouble in my professional life."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes and no, the Problem is 30 Years ago, they where not treating Children with ADHD all to good.

They where havily overdosed untill they where poor little Zombies/Söldner , just to a point where they where easy to work with instead of feeling well. 

And so i desided it was probably for the greater good that i was diagnosed so late, and not beeing treated ""right"" 
I was loved , deeply loved and had a lot of freedom in my childhood it could have been way worse.

(But YES of course if i had the option i would have been treated right with medication in my childhood, but it is not to unlikley that i would have been treated Badly!)"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes, but everything that happened before in my life led to the children that I have, and I can’t imagine changing a single thing in the past because of them. Forward is the way!"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I wish I had tried it when I was younger, and learned about how it affected me - it's taken lots of trial and error to find the right balance, and so starting that younger would have been really valuable (even if I didn't stay on it long term)."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes AND also, doctors didn’t even know that much ADHD to begin with. As a teenager I did see doctors, then as a young adult (early 20s) then as an adult (30s). It was always misdiagnosed as other things (mostly depression and anxiety). I am a woman so that also plays a part in biases against me in the diagnosis process (which at the time, most of the medical literature for ADHD was centered around young boys). 

So it was a late diagnosis for me too."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes. 43 here. Like literally my entire life would be different. I always felt so different than everyone and didn’t know why. 

My current meds help with work focus, social, house stuff, etc. I feel like a functioning adult. I sometimes get sad when I think of the wasted potential of my 20s."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes and no. I'd have probably been more successful career and money in the bank wise. 

Buuuut, I really like my life and the experiences I've had! I'd say I'm fairly content and wouldn't want to lose any of that I have now."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes to meds plus some therapy/counseling o help understand the ""outsiderness""  and learn some ""work arounds"" for better success in school and relationships."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes-without a doubt. It would have changed my life in a number of positive ways.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes and no.
I'm 50. I've tried every ADHD medication and nothing seems to work. Anti-depressants are, well, depressing. They give me terrible headaches or extreme apathy. 
I didn't care about valentine's day or my wife's birthday shortly thereafter. That's when I quit it.
What I wish is that my dad believed more in therapists and I had been given help that way.
In addition, those ADHD days pre-smartphone gave my creative outlets free reign. 
I created a lot of artwork, wrote, directed and acted in lots of theater.
I don't think I'd have been capable with so much time wasted scrolling."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes 💯
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I had the same reaction but I'm glad I didn't dwell it on for very long. I blamed my parents and my schooling also but they just had no idea back then so it's no one's fault. I got diagnosed about a year ago and I'm 39 now. I now think I would have preferred to be diagnosed back then but who knows how these medications affect a growing and developing brain. For me, it's either getting diagnosed early or not at all.

Think of this as you now have superpowers that you have to learn to control, don't waste time on the past as it was mostly out of your hands anyway. It's never too late, I was only yesterday googling Psychology degrees."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Diagnosed at 39. No, I don’t wish I would have gotten the diagnosis earlier. It derailed my degree but I was still able to network and managed to have a pretty good career, thank goodness software engineering is not yet 100% based off credentials."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Diagnosed 38 and 100% wish I had been on meds in school
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I’m only 22 but got diagnosed a couple of months ago. My life would be completely different if i hadn’t been misdiagnosed as bipolar for 6 years and depressed since childhood. I probably would’ve graduated college with my best friend in May,  but instead I’m restarting now."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I was taken and diagnosed at 7 but my parents refused to medicate or treat me. At 18, I started seeking treatment but it was a rough ride of gaslighting doctors and was finally treated at 35. I understand the frustration but you’ve been an adult 21 years. Why did it take you this long to go in?"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I was diagnosed at 41, and oh dear God in heaven, yes I wish I had been diagnosed and medicated when I was a kid"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","The real question is: do you think you would have understood the weight of it back then? Or do you think you would have fully appreciated the diagnosis earlier not knowing how much harder life is without it? 

When things happen this way it's fair to grieve, but it's important to remember that you wouldn't value what you value now without this experience. 

Instead of looking back on how much easier your trek could have been, look forward to how much easier your trek can be from here on out. 

The pain and grief goes away as you learn to appreciate where you are in life right now."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Every day.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","It's only a weekly thread.

I find this to be quite a bit of a stumbling block when trying to work with people that are skeptical about treatment.  Showing people the results with early intervention just makes them feel resentful.  It's better to not dwell on it, and just focus on where you are now."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",As others have said it would have changed my whole life.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I remember being told by so many times, “You’re so smart.  All you need to do is pay attention.”   Nowadays, these people bust your chops for relying on drugs.  

I’m in my 60s, l started using meds in my 30s, and they help.  MYOB."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes, absolutely. I would’ve fulfilled a lot more of what I know I’m capable of"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Trying to avoid the masturbatory ""what I could've been"" internal monologue is often a struggle."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",10000% yes
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",No I wish I was understood and given better tools
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes 👍
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes and I think my life would be different. Namely, I wouldn’t be so burned out."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I wasn't quite that old but I got diagnosed at 22 and since I was then able to eventually go back to college and graduate with a 3.8 GPA when I graduated highschool by the skin of my teeth and a teacher letting me bend the rules, I often wonder what I could have done with my life if my entire formative education wasn't a waste.

I wound up with a very nice life in the end but not having to fight through the years of anger, frustration, and self doubt that still haunt me 20 years after my initial diagnosis would have been pretty neat."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes, 100%"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Absolutely.  I feel I would be more successful.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Fuck… YES
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","During grad school? Yes. Younger than that, I doubt it would've been needed. I think just knowing I had it and understanding how to properly deal with the symptoms while I was in my teens to 20s would've helped a ton."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","No, but girls (and most boys) weren’t diagnosed or medicated when I was young (70s/80s).  I’m glad my parents didn’t chase me around asking if I’d taken my pills."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",42 m I'm still waiting for my diagnosis but I am 100% sure that I have ADHD and that would be a hard yes.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Those emotions sound familiar. 😅 I think most of us who are first diagnosed as adults go through something similar. I went through about a year and a half of trying out all of the hobbies I had never been able to do as a kid. 

Welcome to your new and improved life, my friend."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","No… don’t want a bad heart or the dependence on the meds. However, I am worried about developing dementia."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Totally. I mean, in general I wish I had known, I might have applied other strategies as well to cope better and would have done more with life."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",No. Ritalin was so terrible for me if they'd put me on it I think it would have ruined my life. I'm glad I didn't have access to meds until adulthood when I was able to assess their functionality myself and make my own choices.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I wish I knew, that would have been the best with medicine added."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","More than anything, mostly. Within reason - yknow"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes. This is a very common experience so know you're not alone. Tons of similar posts and they all basically have the same comments. Make space for the grief and try to focus on what you can do now. Sending hugs
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","No. While I would be in a very different place, the humility of failing and the resilience/perseverance it's taken to be alive and able to have very very little and wake up thrilled with every day is something I would have never found in a more conventional path. I feel that the world failed people like me by letting us fall through the cracks, and not being there with a hand when people stumble. That said, there were persons that were there when I needed them to be. I am ok now. I can give the back to the world and be the change I want to see. I wouldn't have had the drive to learn about my rough spots and find ways to smooth them out. It's hard to have empathy when you're hurting all the time and don't know why. ADHD isn't a hindrance if I don't choose to let it be, my life wasn't ""wasted"" if I don't view it that way. I have learned, I have taught, I have been, I have experienced. Medication would have been something I used to avoid doing the work as a younger more arrogant person."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","100%  it would have been life changing for me personally. 
I have had the most unconventional life. 
When all friends and family have there shit together and good jobs coming up 50 years old. 
Where I have worked since I has 15 in night clubs after finding my dad dead. 
Them got booted out of my home for been naughty and went to live with my nan. 
I thought with that with me dad and then falling out with my mum who’s a bit crazy anyway. 
I had a fall age about 7-8 where I feel on a sort and split my skull open and knocked myself out. 
Was in 2nd to top class in school but failed all my exams or just never turned up for some. 
School in the 80s in liverpool was crazy anyway. 
No wonder my dyslexia and adhd was not even a word back then. Then my sister died in frount of my eyes me age 22 her 31. 
Good job I had a kid that got me though that as it took 16 years to even talk about her. 
So with that 20 year relationship with 3 kids 
Ended. Then had a 10 year relationship. 
Now everyone thought I was a bit mad. 
I thought I was different from everyone to. 
Me my family friends have always just laughed at my funny way. And got away with so much with humour.
Just if I would have known 
And all around me had known 
Things would have been a lot different in my life. 
As me and around my would have had a better understanding of me. 
Reading all about adhd 
I thought it was just naughty hypo kids that’s it. 
I wish I would have been medicated younger 
And been able to concentrate. 
I have learned a million skills and mastered none. 
Took up pairing this year doing a wall mural 
Taken a few months. And never painted before done a massive lions head , birds , flamingos 
Flowers , plants. 
But as with everything eles. 
Not one of them is finished nor am I sure they ever will be.  
But looking back. 
It’s was the end of my relationships and don’t blame any my ex partners. 
Am a pain in the arse , I don’t shut up , I would write a list here of the stupid way my brain works. It does my head in. 
But I have had a good life and can not complain 
A bit of a mad life. 
As worked night clubs from age 15. Then from 22 after me sister died. Worked the Hackney taxis. Woking outside pubs and nightclubs for 20 years. And just seen everything you could imagine. And went through everything you could imagine some great some not so.  
But covid from me working on the bat man film in liverpool till the day covid hit. 
Has wreaked my life. Normal life until covid hit. 
Now have sleep apnea I never knew I had. 
Waiting to be assessed for asd. Found out I have ptsd. What’s happened in last 4 years is a story in its self. 
But my life would have been easier to know I had all this 🤷🏻‍♂️. 
Does the medication work ?  
As listened to that many podcast , health shit of last few years. I don’t trust pharma"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","i just turned 25 this year, so not quite the age range ur looking for, but i just wanted to say if i was medicated in highschool i could have been valedictorian lol. i would've gone to college, maybe actually had a career i was interested in. but because i wasn't, i couldn't even tell you what i would go to school for. i have interests, and would like to have a degree of some kind, but with me fully financially supporting myself it seems like more stress than i could afford right now. my main gripe with only JUST becoming medicated in the last year is that my work performance has absolutely skyrocketed, but i'm still trying to make up for the lack of work ethic i've displayed in the 5 years i've had my job. it has 100% improved my life in ways i never would have imagined and i only can wish now that i felt like this as a kid. little me could have done so much more if people just tried to help me"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes and no. 

Yes, because I could've avoided years of depression and nonexistent self-worth had I started medication before I went to college. That's when everything fell apart the first time. I could've had a career. I could've been financially responsible. 

Instead, I spent 20 years feeling like an abject failure of a human because I could never get my shit together. 

The no is because of my kids. If I'd been medicated earlier, I wouldn't have been where I needed to be in order to meet my husband, and my favorite people on earth would never have been born. 

When I think about it that way, I wouldn't change anything about my past if it meant living life without them."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",I am similar age and not yet diagnose because I am afraid to see someone in person and also cannot take off. How did you get diagnosed? Online or in person? I wish I had been evaluated as a kid but people thought adhd was the sterotypical misbehaving hyper kid who had issues in school back then so no one noticed.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes. I was. I was alienated, so I took myself off of it. Then told myself I wasn’t being strong enough. 

I got medicated - 38… now unwinding the self inflicted trauma."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Absolutely.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","In the same boat friend, lil bit younger though 
I'm 32 and currently trying to find a reasonable Dr.
What worked for me with all the dredged up feelings from the past is that you can't get hung up on that. You got to think about now, The way I've approached managing the anger and resentment is it's not their faults, they didn't know, they wasn't properly educated on ADHD. They did the best they could with the knowledge that was available to them.
They cared, they just didn't have the proper tools available to them to help you.

"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Help me please! I badly want to have official ADHD diagnosis but I don't know where to start. I live in Northern  BC Canada
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes, definitely. It was a night and day difference when I started on Vyvanse. I was happy to finally feel like a functional person. And then I was angry that I didn't get to feel that way until I was 40 because the signs were dismissed and ignored when I was a child."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",I just wish I had known at all. Just knowing and some strategic learning would have sent me to the moon (my grief of lost potential will never EVER go away).
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","As an unpopular opinion, no, not really. But I also don't tend to think much about the past.

I did fine in school up until college. I made a lot of poor impulsive decisions that definitely sent my life on a different path than it would have gone had I been medicated. There were some pretty intense consequences at times (but hey, how many people can say they know what solitary confinement is like?!) But, in general, I learned a bunch of coping mechanisms to deal with being me and I like who I am now.

I have a prescription, it definitely helps with a lot of tasks, especially if I don't want to do them. I've found that, *for me* (and I cannot stress enough how this is a personal anecdote and probably doesn't apply to others), I perform better on non-creative tasks when medicated, but I tend to get hung up on minor details and miss the big picture when trying to solve problems that require more creativity.

Ultimately I don't like taking medication long-term in general, so that's just my own weird personal hangup. I would bet most people with ADHD have *much* better lives medicated than not. But what's most important is you find a solution that works for you. For some, that's medication. For some that is CBT or learning different coping mechanisms."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes. But for me it is not much about the medication but about the ability to access pertinent psychological advise and counseling (given the chance that medication sometimes do not work). I feel that the amount of trauma and self hatred could be much less. Hope I’m explaining myself and making sense. But yeah, after medication know I know that I’ve taken the fault for so many things that I should not have to, specially being a kid."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I was diagnosed in year 5 but my mother didn’t want me to go one anything because in the early 90’s it was controversial. 
I was re diagnosed 2 months ago and have been so focused since. I complete my work in a few hours and manage to do a lot of projects. 
I believe if I was diagnosed again earlier and took control myself, I would be more successful and would have had a better idea of the direction I wanted to go. 

But in no means has my life been bad. Harder but not bad at all. I am content where I am."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Of fucking course … I’d be a rocket-surgeon
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Definitely but TBF to my parents they could not have known, when I was young only ""naughty boys"" were assessed for ADHD, I genuinely don't remember a single girl who was even  thought as possibly having ADHD.

When I took my first concerta I cried at how much easier life could have been."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Life’s a crap shoot baby. Maybe you excelled or maybe not. There’s far too many things happening to be bitter/pissed. Look at it this way, you’re mad you didn’t figure all this out/get medicine at 20 right?  Well think about how mad you’re going to be if you look back in 20 years with what you know now and didn’t take advantage of it.   Now go take that legal speed and do something good with it!!!"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes! I was diagnosed at 45 and thinking back if I was diagnosed earlier I would of followed through with my college degree and had a job I truly wanted and loved, I settled for whatever fit me before I knew I had adhd"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes. And i started going for therapy when i was 14 because my parents knew they didn’t have the skills to deal with whatever was wrong with me. I started seeing a psychiatrist in my early 20s and was diagnosed with depression. On one hand i feel very let down, on the other hand I mostly talked about how depressed I was not the lack of focus, starting things and never finishing, getting into hobbies and spending a small fortune on the best equipment because it was going to be my new favourite thing (that I’d do 2-3x). I figured it out myself after asking my doctor for Vyvanse for my binge eating. Within three days I had organized piles of stuff that had been sitting for months (if not based on the dates of receipts etc). I started using the whiteboard that had hung on my fridge for months. Being a procrastinator that never finishes things is really depressing. Have life decisions made by default because I was frozen by indecision is depressing. The worse part for me is the social rejection which the meds don’t help with that much but at least I can recognize it and process it instead of bawling my face off over nothing. 

Apparently I still haven’t figured out how to stay on point. So yes very angry. Instead of numerous credits in various subjects I’d likely have finished my degree and be in a much better spot. I could quit my fucking job because I’d be able to get a better one instead of being stuck in a place I hate"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Can’t turn back the clock. Much more info now than back then. You cannot blame your parents for your life. Go forth and conquer.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Oh God, yes. I would've done significantly better academically, made better career decisions and not burned myself out so many times."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",YES.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Idk yes and no. Like everything happens for a reason. Yeah like where would life be if I took it earlier? Could be good could be bad. I’ll never know. But we can just learn from those moments from when we were younger in a different light now. Like instead of a crutch use it as an advantage going forward. You accomplished what you did up to now battling this disease without any help. Who knows what you’ll accomplish now while helping yourself.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",A resounding hell yes.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",100%. My life would be completely different
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes but honestly I have so many other issues compounding, what would have been helpful would have been meds AND therapy. I think then I would have had much better relationships rather than anxiety, self image issues, irritability, and learned passive aggressiveness (thanks parents) basically sabotaging friendships as well as opportunities for new friendships.

I always did well academically and in my career, but I do wonder how far I could have gone if I'd been able to concentrate better and not procrastinate. For context, diagnosed just last month at 37."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes but I can't blame my parents. My mom especially. She was also diagnosed with ADHD
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Absolutely! I could have conquered the world.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","No and I can't blame my parents for not recognizing it - especially because it wasn't something common for girls to ""have"" back then. I was also labeled strong-willed, difficult, etc. and I'm still strong willed. That determination and stubbornness got me through two degrees and part of the way into a PhD (I was dx during the second year of my PhD program). 

There's no sense in being angry over what could have been - that changes nothing about now. All the diagnosis did for me was help me understand why I am (and have been) the way I am. I don't dislike most of the attributes associated with adhd (the exception being my terrible time management and lack of desire to do anything I find even remotely boring which can be a lot of daily tasks)."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Diagnosed at 50. Yes.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I was diagnosed with ADHD last year when I was 37. I’m so curious what would have happened if I had been diagnosed sooner (during my last job, that was my degree that I feel like I failed). I often wonder if I had been medicated during that job, where would I be now? But oh well. And I’m happy now. Medication has been life changing!"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Life is hard.  We’re all just struggling to make it through the best we can.  My mom tried, but even trying myself, I didn’t get diagnosed until about 25 years old.  it was only after we tried every SSRI and Benzo in the book, and having my new boss open up to me that she was taking concerta and was telling me because she saw a lot of similarities between us, that I was able to ask and try a stimulant.  Otherwise, I still might not even know.

I don’t know who needs to hear this, but I’ve been on stimulants for 15+ years….I’ve been doing some genetic research lately, and found that taking NALT (or L-Tyrosine) has SIGNIFICANTLY helped reduce my ADHD symptoms and emotional sensitivity; to the point that I’ve reduced the amount of Vyvanse I am taking (Vyvanse has been my ride or die for 5+ years).  I also take phosphataditylcholine with it and it helps as well."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",I guess it would have been different but I genuinely have no clue
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","No. I was diagnosed as an adult and with the medications they put me on at the time made me worse, not better. Though I wish I had the classes to help me out, but there is nothing for adults other than pills."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","For sure. I was diagnosed/went on Ritalin at age 23-24, it was truly life changing. I'm slightly (only slightly) wary at the idea of taking such meds as a preteen, but certainly wish I had a competent/helpful PCP (pediatrician) that would have treated my ADHD back in high school."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Only a bit maybe? As a kid, I had NO problems till I got to college. And then I'm not even sure my problems were adhd related or just me being a kid with way too much freedom on my hands. But I went through some REAL dark shit between 2014-2019,and I thought it was all depression and anxiety but now I think it was exacerbated by the adhd, and therapy and medication for all three would have made a world of difference (my depression and anxiety wasn't even treated at that point. Honestly I could have benefitted from being hospitalized, even). Would have been literally life changing."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",I got diagnosed at 25 and I definitely wish I had atleast gotten help during high school. I could have better lived up to my potential.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","yep, easy"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yea
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Absolutely. I had to dial back on this particular line of thought because of how many things could have potentially turned out differently. It was triggering a grief response that took some time to come to terms with.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Hell yes.  Would have been quite significant.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",I got diagnosed at 59. Your story of disappointment after diagnosis and medication is almost identical to mine. I'm 62 now and still angry at my folks for all the opportunities I missed and all the violence and abuse I suffered while growing up because of it.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Absolutely. I’m still mourning what could have been.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yea and no.  Sure there’s things I that would have been different.  I would have probably done better at school. But I wouldn’t be who I am today without my past. I hold no resentment towards my parents it just wasn’t known about living in the middle of nowhere when I was a kid.  In saying that I had a spontaneous fun life 😂 I’ve felt it’s affected me more now I’ve “settled” wife house kids etc.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",100000%.  Its why I never stopped testing.  I had to be tested 3x before I was finally dx.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?", Absolutely
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",I feel that it would have changed the trajectory of my life and I’d have a career I enjoy more.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Fuck yes.  Just the annihilation of my anxiety alone was fucking amazing.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes and No.  I was diagnosed at 40, and certainly had a lot of struggles with behavior and mental wellness up to and through my 20s, but I also think many of those struggles made me a stronger person as I learned how to compensate and deal with challenge.  While I got my degree, I surely could have done a lot better with grades and eventual job prospects, but I also chose the hardest courses whenever it was my choice.  I ultimately got to the 'good jobs' through the hard work of proving yourself and sticking through the tough times.  Sure, maybe I would be 'further' in my life had I been medicated early, my teachers certainly would have been happier, but this is just one more of those shoulda-coulda-woulda scenarios, of which life will present many.  Being angry at someone else for your life's outcome is completely useless and a waste of energy.  Your own decisions always have an exponentially larger impact on your life, than other's decisions, disability or not."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Absolutely. I spent my entire life being called lazy, difficult, stubborn, over-emotional, etc. etc. while simultaneously being shamed because ""You're so smart/bright/talented why won't you just try/focus/apply yourself."" I wonder if school might have been more bearable; I've always loved to learn but actual school was just... soul crushing. I wonder what other paths my life might've taken if I hadn't struggled so much academically and socially. I also wonder if maybe I could've avoided developing some of the bad habits that make my life difficult now, the impulsivity, over eating, over spending, the complete and utter lack of executive function. I'm sure I would've still had faults and struggles, but maybe they wouldn't have been quite so overwhelming."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Meh, me consistently fucking my life up through procrastination and impulsivity got me to the happy place I am in today. I would have never met my wife or had nearly as many rad experiences."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yeah. I would have completed high school, not failed out of my first semester of college, and likely would have been a completely different person. Took me 10-15 years to find my path again. The ADHD diagnosis was actually the last part of getting my life together that I did. I managed the rest basically unmedicated. Possible, but not fun."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",It is very likely that one (or both) of your parents have ADHD as well if you have it. Plus awareness has changed drastically over the years. I was not diagnosed until I was 20 after I melted down in college without forced structure. I also think it’s important to remember that even though medication does help (especially at first) that it’s not at all a cure - things will still be harder for people like us medicated or not.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes, 100 times, yes. I am only a few months post diagnosis and medication. I cannot tell you how much more mental stamina I have, I am able to find words easier without staring at someone like my brain stopped ticking. I am able to sit at my desk and be fully interested in what is in front of me. I am proud of myself for struggling and pushing through, but it is so nice to be able to not have to expend all of that mental energy."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes, would have been able to think clearly and prioritize my life"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes, but thinking about it is a waste of time and energy."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Absolutely wish I was medicated earlier. All of my coping mechanisms are slowly dwindling and being replaced by healthy habits now that I have my Rx.  The quieting of the ruminating thoughts has helped in so many ways and I was able to get off 2 of my other meds due to the adhd meds. Feels good man.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes and no. No because I wouldn’t have chosen my husband if medicated and I would have never had my 2 amazing children. Yes because I burned out at 30 and spent a few years struggling to get my footing again think there was something seriously wrong with me after a stream of unsuccessful jobs in the startup scene and lack of stability I was able to provide myself.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Wishing something had happened in the past just fuels depression and resentment. I know what you are getting at, maybe it might have helped but honestly as I don’t know what it’s like to be on meds for adhd I have no idea what I could have achieved. 

Even being off meds I have been lucky I guess."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I was diagnosed at 30yo.  Don't be angry.  You can go to school now and get your degree.  You can lead a better life now. 

When I was a kid people didn't know about ADHD.   Don't blame your parents for what they didn't know."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","44M diagnosed at 42. I had the same feeling initially but once I thought it through and spoke to my parents, they barely understand ADHD now, let alone 30/40 years ago."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","No, wish I'd been on therapy though.




I started meds along with law school, and so It gave me a boost to skills I already needed to have. 


So I think I partly managed to learn to get shit done without meds....


Actually now I think about It, yeah, I do regret it, my childhood could be a lot easier"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Grieving the loss of a life that could have been is a part of the process. I got diagnosed at 46. Lost so much in terms of relationships and career. Big sad. But already I've been able to use my dx to self-advocate against attempted constructive dismissal in my workplace and tbh my bad experiences as a result of being undiagnosed and untreated have given me wisdom that is still useful even now.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I think many of us, especially females, were not getting rightfully diagnosed back then. (I’m Gen X. )No one would ever think that little girls would have ADHD because we didn’t exhibit the hyperactivity symptoms like the boys would. I got diagnosed very early, but they didn’t really do anything about that either. My parents put me in a private school with smaller classes to help with my attention and focused and so my teachers would have more times to help me, etc. but no medication ever. That makes me a little mad because imagine how much better my life could’ve been had I had that? But there were other issues going on in my family that was likely the cause of me not getting the proper care at this time.  I wish I could’ve gotten medicated for this earlier because I had so much trouble in school and even jobs in adulthood due to executive function issues.  I also have autism, which is a recent discovery, so trying to get everything worked out, but it’s hard.. I’ve been struggling with severe anxiety and depression issues for the past two years or so and it’s been incredibly difficult as far as adjusting to medication, etc., and trying to deal with all this stuff triggering my anxiety at the same time. I’m working with my psychiatrist and therapist in the hopes that we can find a good balance soon."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",YES.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","yes, im 56 and the entire educational and mental health system failed my generation"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Just ""diagnosed"" at 41. REALLY wish I was diagnosed earlier. Feel like I've squandered 99% of my potential."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yeah, I would have stood up to all of my bullies. I don't know if any of the other guys can relate, but it is not a good feeling to run out of concentration in the middle of a fist fight."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Would have been a game changer. I get so emotional about it if I think about it too much 

(⁠ ⁠⚈̥̥̥̥̥́⁠⌢⁠⚈̥̥̥̥̥̀⁠)"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Same... diagnosed at 38, F. I struggled and persevered so much as a young girl and into my teens and early 20s, when I was diagnosed and treated for MDD. I dropped out of my art degree in 2nd year due to this depression and sense of extreme mental exhaustion and social awkwardness that so often happens when you're on the spectrum. 
My parents loved me, no doubt. But they're fucking oblivious to anything really. Me, being a people pleasing girl when I was little, didn't want to upset anyone or rock the boat with my behavior, so I masked to the extreme, being super shy socially, and ""doing well"" and excelling in the stuff that interested me. Until it didn't.  
If I were medicated, or even diagnosed as a child or teen, I have no doubt that my life would've been different. Hopefully in a positive way. Being properly medicated and not focusing on depression as the main diagnosis. It was and is, a result of untreated, pretty intense adhd that I hid my whole life. I do resent my parents for obliviousness & not seeing anything odd in me. At the same time, I often dwell and grieve who I could've been, rather than being grateful for the life, and sons that I do have."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Meds didn't work for me so. 🤷‍♀️
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I got lucky and went through life okay-ish. I just really liked computers and manages to stumble through school. I'm not medicated currently but partially because my heart really didn't like the meds but also because I noticed that on meds I lose so much of what I thought was me but seems to be the ADHD that I don't recognize myself as a person. So even though I didn't need it to get through school and have a good life, I think I would have liked myself a lot more if I was medicated in school just because I would have known what is ADHD and what is personality."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Don't be too hard on your parents. I wasn't diagnosed until I was 45. Having a higher IQ than average I'm sure made it hard for my parents to notice the issues I was having, I didn't know anything about it, schools in my time didn't really seem to screen for it. It is what it is. It doesn't matter if I would have liked to be diagnosed and on meds sooner in life, it isn't possible and it's a very useless exercise. It will get better."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I think all of us who are late diagnosed go through a mourning period for our younger selves and all of the paint we went through and the mistakes and missed opportunities along the way. Over time it gets easier. 

I console myself with the fact that, as a your girl with inattentive ADHD, it is likely that even if my parents did take me to see a doctor I probably wouldn’t have been diagnosed."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","As someone who is still unmediated, yessssssss"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I can certainly run a thought experiment in my head where it would've interesting to see which of my decisions were really ""me"" and which were ADD.  Would I have dropped out of college?  Maybe not.  But I am so in love with my love now it's hard to imagine wishing it at all to have gone different."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes, I do. I am also 39 and was diagnosed this year. I have so much regret and anger about my past. I am having a difficult time moving forward. I"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yup, feels like I wasted time ."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I only got dx’d last week so currently awaiting titration with some trepidation. Lots of others have described the positive impact it has had on them and I can barely let myself hope it will work for me. One thing for sure is that I’m not gonna go down the road of lamenting what could have been because it wasn’t, in the end. I did all that stuff when I got an autism dx five years ago."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",I was just medicated in .... Uh different ways
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes. Primarily because I'd probably still have my dream job.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes but honestly I’m so relieved to finally have an answer as to why I am the way I am and that a tiny dose of Amphetamine could turn me from world class flake plagued by crippling anxiety to person who can finally more or less adult at 56 years of age that I don’t waste too much time obsessing over what could have been
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I learned when I was right around 37.

After a few medications, I went with Adderall XR’s. It definitely helped me through a very tough time.

Currently unmedicated…. Mostly due to costs and insurance issues, but so far working through it without the wheels falling off…. Although I know that medication is a critical thing for many.

I do wish I knew I had ADHD as a kid, but I’m not sure if medication would have helped me then. Knowing more about my condition, I think I may have let it define me in a way I’m not as an adult.

So… I both wish I knew I was ADHD, but am glad I wasn’t medicated as a kid. I realize this makes no sense 🙃"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes. Diagnosed at 57, thinking about all that wasted energy. I could have taken on the world if I could have focused. As it was I got blah grades even though I enjoyed learning. Exams were the most stressful thing ever, hey you that can’t remember things, let’s give you several tests that will influence everything you do from here on. Oh by the way you have to remember things and write them down for us. It’s like asking someone with a broken leg to run a marathon."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",The grief is 100% real.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes absolutely, life altering for the better in every way.

I did not get my Engineering degree until I was 26.

Was kicked out of college for having a 1.5 GPA, right before I was diagnosed and put on medication.

Wrote a letter to the dean was allowed back in but on academic probation. Then I graduated with a 3.5.

Being diagnosed saved my life.

ADHD drastically derailed my career. A career I've been passionate about all my life. I knew since I was little that technology and engineering are my passion but ADHD got in the way.

Now, I'm one of the top engineers at the biggest hospital in the state and I can manage and use my ADHD to my advantage."

"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Life was hard, and frustrating, and at times very, very painful.
But it was also absolutely wonderful, both in spite of and because of functioning differently than societal standards.

Grieve the life you could have had.
Embrace the one you do.
Grow into the one you will."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","i'm still a youngish teen, and my parent is unsure about medicating me. i wish i had medication for this. it's so hard to get through days. she says that just because i've been diagnosed with adhd i don't need medication, after all my grades haven't been absolutely horrible, but she doesn't understand how hard it is. i wish i knew what it was like to be able to think properly without losing my train of thought and my attention and focus multiple times per minute. hopefully i can medicate later in life."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Oh, yes. Undergrad for me was a hellscape. Graduate school has clicked in such a different way… and I’m not even currently medicating. Just understanding my impulses and exec dysfunction, and having apt coping mechanisms has been life changing. I wish I’d been lucky enough to have this same skill set as a child."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes. All the time.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes.

It feels like 30-40 years were stolen from me.  I do not think I can ever let go of that rage, anger, and disgust with the medical community.  It literally caused traumatic neurological pain when I realized what they had done (had not done).  I am still furious, daily - 2 years later.

Mid 50s now and so little life left to achieve what I could have...

I have to manage myself to avoid decking the next Doctor that dismisses it or acts like it's not a big deal they STOLE 4 DECADES from me.  In the end, I prescribe my own meds and told my doctor he was going to comply.  He did.  He is still clueless as to how to manage it and the therapist he referred me to was an inexperienced intern who wanted to find PTSD that I did not have, in me...

I have ZERO FAITH in the medical community.  I still feel like I am on my own.

GRRRR, still angry.  This post made me angrier."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I was diagnosed at 31, but meds didn’t actually help me, so I’m not really wishing I’d been on them sooner 😔."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes, but I’m damned if I am going to dwell on anything I can’t change, when I can avoid it. I’m too old for that crap."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes. Got diagnosed at 39 and almost 40 now. My life would be substantially different. 

I am angry about my parents never doing anything about it for my first 18 years with clear issues that could have been addressed.

But also anger at my therapists and psychologists I've had over the 20+ years I was in and out of therapy and not once did they say ADHD. No one mentioned medication. They could have helped me when I was clearly asking for help for ADHD even if I didn't know what that was."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","A really RRREALLLY unpopular opinion but… no.

That probably wouldn’t have always been my answer but at the age of 42, I’m not angry or bitter or sad or resentful.  

I am okay with all then easy things that ADHD made difficult because it also made a lot of difficult things easy for me."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Absolutely! I still mourn the death of who I could have been.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",No
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Unfortunately no. I have autism on top of my ADHD, which can make you more prone to side-effects, or make it so the medication just straight up doesn't work. My psych thought it'd be a good idea to start me on a child-sized dose to see if my body could tolerate it, and I didn't even last a week...

I stopped taking the medication, then coincidentally had to get my wisdom teeth out shortly after, so I'm waiting till I've recovered more to check in with my doctor. Might try halving the dose, or try a different medication entirely, I don't know yet.

It would have been nice to have support as a kid, but I'm glad I'm only trying medication now. As a kid, I wouldn't have been able to communicate those unpleasant side effects, and I can only imagine how much worse they would have been when I was smaller. I like being able to have agency over something like this."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","💯. Every day. I don’t know how I made it through nursing school unmedicated… but at least I know the cycle now stops with ME. I recognized the ADHD symptoms in my daughter and have gotten her evaluated, medicated and talking to a therapist so hopefully she NEVER feels the way I do… It’s still really hard for me every day, though. Medication helps me focus, but not what to focus ON, and it’s hard to be the good example I want to be for her because I’m still such a mess myself. I’m so glad you got the diagnosis you needed, and I hope your life only gets better from here ❤️"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Everyone you just said is me and I’m 39 just diagnosed
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",The short answer is yes….for so many reasons
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes. It would have changed my life for the better.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","For me, I am a 27 female and when I was 26 I saw a psychologist to get tested.

Unfortunately, I went through the whole process, and when I was supposed receive my final results, my health insurance expired and I was unemployed at that time and was unable to renew my insurance. The doctor I saw also left the company..so I’m f’ed to put it short. *also, so ADHD of me to go months without being able to renew my health insurance because it feels like such a long and hassle task*

My parents have always been very against doctors, and my whole childhood my parents would never take myself or my sister to the hospital unless we were dying. 

My dad, who myself and my sister mostly lived with, would always say that doctors are quacks and they don’t actually care, they just want money. Hence why I didn’t seek an official ADHD diagnoses until later in life. 

I have guilt. I question if I even have it. I’ve never seen my results from my diagnosis, but I’m 99.9% I have it.

It’s normal to not seek help until you’re older"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Oh my dear God, I was diagnosed with ADD at 31 and started medication. Everything finally made sense. I had multiple arguments with my husband about normal marriage/couple things that, after diagnosis, we discussed and understood. 

I barely finished my master's degree, which was an absolute nightmare. I love studying and researching, but many aspects of my job stressed me out, and I didn't know why. I wish I had been diagnosed earlier; school wouldn't have been a nightmare, and staying in touch with people wouldn't have been a chore.

After starting medication, my thoughts are better organized, and I can think on my feet, responding to arguments and debates with reasonable points. I must admit, I'm sad about the years without diagnosis and medication, and sometimes I think about what could've been better. But it is what it is. I can only be better moving forward 😌"""
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Medication was the least of my problems as a child. Would it have helped? Maybe. But what it would have most helped me was to not be in a toxic abusive environment
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",I just started Vyvanse 3 weeks ago and I definitely wish I would have started in high school. I bet my life would have taken a much different path.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Been there done that. I was diagnosed at 46.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Honestly, I wish I was medicated starting in college. I wasn't diagnosed until I was 34"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes, gods yes, life would have been easier, not just because of the medication but because I’d know it’s not because I’m lazy, rude, incompetent, spacey daydreaming idiot.  Maybe I wouldn’t have quite as much trauma to heal from."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes. My aunt thought I was adhd when I was 7-10. Mom thought no. Started medication in my forties. Not to mention controlling the poor impulse control, if I knew how the adhd mind worked it would have saved me a lot of pain when I didn’t ‘work’ the way others did and thought something was wrong with me. I had an mri and thought I had early Alzheimer’s because of my short term memory problems. Nope, adhd."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yeah I probably would have stayed in school.  Probably would have never become addicted to things I shouldn’t have been.  I never would have self medicated.  Somehow I made it, but not without massive speed bumps."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Couldn’t agree more. Makes me sad every time I think about it. I too was only diagnosed in my 30s…
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Oh my god yes. I was diagnosed this year at 43 after a lifetime of wondering what the actual fuck was wrong with me. Why couldn’t I achieve the same things as my family/friends were, why couldn’t I finish anything I started, why a life time of self medication and addiction, and many more questions of course.
Even just being diagnosed would have helped me in my life exponentially with or without medication. 
The only reason we even got here in the end was that my eldest son was diagnosed, and after looking into it for the first time sent me down the same path. None of my mates that have none me for 2/3 decades were at all surprised.
After my mental health began spiralling at around 40, and then starting medication, I mourn for the life I could have led after finally experiencing what a quiet brain sounds like."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I had that feeling. Got diagnosed around 30. It made my struggles in school make so much sense. College was hell for me especially. I had so much freedom and could not buckle down. So many extremely late nights screaming at myself to just get started on homework. I found out that my parents were told by multiple teachers they thought I had ADHD but my parents just brushed it off, believing the teachers were lazy and couldn't handle their students. I could have been in control from elementary school on, but instead I just dealt with feeling inadequate. All of my siblings doing so much better in school, while I couldn't get past C averages. Parents joking that they wouldn't believe I graduated high school til they saw it in the program. Feels great!"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes, but I mostly wish I even just had the diagnosis. I wouldn’t have grown up thinking something (everything!) was wrong with me. My diagnosis (at 40) was so validating but I went through a few months of pretty deep grief for little girl me."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",I’m curious why you have anger towards your parents? You could have gotten help on your own  21 years ago when you turned 18.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes and I'm still in the anger stage about it. I would have had a much more comfortable life, would have achieved so much. I'm not mad at any person, just shaking my fist at the sky. It literally wasn't possible for me to be diagnosed when I was younger, as it wasn't a diagnosis for girls when I was young. 

So mad though."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","You've just spelled out my entire life from my childhood to my adulthood today. I'm 37 now, being medicated for ADHD with Ritalin at first but now with Concerta, and wished so hard that my parents did something earlier.

But I also realised that when I was young, ADHD may not have been easily recognised as kids will always be kids - active, boisterous, moody, etc. Also, I doubt my parents were exposed to anything remotely related to ADHD and so may not have noticed the symptoms in me. I do still wished I was diagnosed earlier and I would have had a different life. I can't fault them for not noticing this earlier.

The one I would blame is my uncle from UK. He noticed it but said nothing about it. Now that he knows I am officially ADHD, he says things like I knew it, or see, I was right. Yes, all that could have helped me better in the past!"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",I think school would’ve been a lot easier to get through. I would fall asleep throughout the day so frequently I couldn’t get a lot of things done. My medication keeps me awake and aware but if I was in school it would’ve really helped a lot.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes. Maybe not as a child but for sure as an adult. 
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",I don’t like being on meds now
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I do wish I was diagnosed younger, but unfortunately things were different back then. School was easy for me so obviously I couldn't have ADHD according to 1990s standards. I probably wouldn't have created so many bad habits, coping mechanisms, and wouldn't have had to mask so much. Perhaps I wouldn't have developed severe depression anxiety and borderline personality disorder. 

But while I wish I were diagnosed earlier I don't blame my parents. They were basically small town/country folk that moved to the suburbs and had a kid who showed signs that they didn't know meant ADHD but did well in school. All I can do now is stick to my meds, get sleep, and get therapy to help break my bad habits. Also with the knowledge I've gained, I can help my kid if he starts to show signs and even spread awareness among my social groups."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yup. Still getting over the fact I wasn't. It's been 2+ years.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","No bc I would’ve been like 70 lbs in high school if I had been medicated. Grades would’ve been amazing, though."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes. No doubt whatsoever.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","No, but I'm not on meds 10ish months post diagnosis (in my early 40s) so I don't have a gauge how that would've impacted things. 

I do wish that I'd known I wasn't broken, too much/not enough though. And I wish someone truly saw me & offered concrete supports. But at least I can advocate for my own kids with ADHD and help them navigate things, so there's that."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Everyone diagnosed as an adult goes through these stages of anger and grief.  It helps to have a therapist for this.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes. Diagnosed at 48.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","""From my perspective, as someone who was diagnosed at a very young age (seven) and was medicated with Ritalin I  don't particularly like  medication. Every person is different, and I would much prefer if someone showed me how to work around my ADHD rather than drugging me because many of those medications, especially at a young age, can have side effects such as tics, impulses, depression, and insomnia. Sometimes, children can also be overmedicated. When I was going to high school, my parents put me back on medication, and it was so powerful that I started drooling in class. I felt as if I were in a vegetative state. But as I mentioned before, each person is different. This is just my perspective."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I slept on average 3-4 hours a night for 47 years. Now I’m medicated, I sleep properly. But everything was always an uphill battle of exhaustion. I self medicated with alcohol and drugs which made me even more tired. Plus I would binge on salty foods. I’m much healthier now I’m medicated, less impulsive and a lot more willpower."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes, it would've been a different life had I been diagnosed earlier. Just got officially medicated last week at 39 myself.

There's just one hitch... I actually was diagnosed back in high school after being recommended by the school. I didn't know this until I hyperfixated on getting myself tested, and wanted to make sure I had all relevant information for my upcoming psychiatry appointment. I managed to go on Google Maps and ""walk myself"" around the area I knew I'd been tested at until I was able to read the sign in front of the building, use the WayBack Machine to find their old website, then search LinkedIn for this now-retired ADHD Educational therapist, who just so happened to still have my records.

My family told me I ""had a small memory issue, but was too smart for ADHD and I just needed to focus myself and stop being so lazy.""  This mantra lived within me, that I was just being lazy, for the last 20 years- I can't tell you how frustrated I am with my parents.  I got the therapists official notes and report from 20 years ago and it very clearly diagnoses me as ADHD as fuck. 

I'm still having a hard time understanding how my Mom was able to get mad at me and give me endless shit for all sorts of different stuff over the years that was just untreated ADHD that she clearly knew about and chose to hide. We haven't had that conversation yet, but it's not going to be a fun one."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes, diagnosed a few months ago in my 50's and it's been a little rocky adjusting medications."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I was diagnosed as a kid, but also pretty abused at home. consequently I had a lot of issues in school.

My mom tried to get me medicated twice, but more as a disciplinary move than anything else. Pretty gaslighty. Both times lasted a week or so before I was hiding pills in my mouth and throwing them out. 

I finally got medicated for me in my 30s and it’s been HUGE. The first week on Ritalin was light a fucking bat signal— my emotional regulation issues have always been significant and to have them switched off like a light?

Life changing. Literally."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",I'm 41 and still trying to find a doctor to diagnose me 😭 my whole life is such a struggle
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I was diagnosed at 35. I always fell asleep in class, but passed every test.

I would read in class and ignore the lectures in high school. 
I would look at the same problems in math and figure them out without instruction.
I completed tests without a graphing calculator quicker than kids with a calculator. 

I didn't have insurance as a kid so it was never an option for me.
I cant help but feel frustration at that because I skimmed by and passed everything effortlessly, but never pushed to challenge myself. 

I could have achieved more but was too busy getting distracted by the interest de jour. 

I cant change that now and oddly enough the reason I was diagnosed was because my wife noticed traits between our kids and myself. I went in did the test and was told. Started medication and suddenly it was like being in the eye of a tornado but with everything slowing down so I could pick out all the details."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Honestly. It depends on what kind of meds you’re working with. Some work and some don’t. I wish I was diagnosed sooner so I had a better understanding of what I was going through. But regardless of being on meds or not parents are no help for me. They either tell me to get on meds or tell me to get stronger ones even if I explain what I’m going through and why. Just depends on your environment. Honestly I just focus on how to better my life and better understand it now.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",My entire life would be so different had I been medicated then. No doubt I wpuldn't be sleeping all day because I can't stand the pain and loneliness. 
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Probably wouldn’t have been a good idea because I drank the last half of high school and experimented with other drugs. Pretty sure I would have abused it.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Diagnosed at 26. I had my suspicions for couple years but it’s at that age that I could finally muster enough money&time&courage to do the first examinations. 

yes a diagnosis just couple years earlier would have been nice. But even at that point my problem was not limited to adhd - I needed therapy, better communication skills and boundaries. Being diagnosed with mental disability is in itself a catastrophic event that requires trial and error to maneuver around. Medicine alone wouldn’t have solved everything. 

I know I had been trying my best everyday considering the circumstances & it‘s not like there were other options. So I just strive to do better each day."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Man, I was 8 when I was diagnosed and my parents decided NOT to medicate 😭
Furthermore, I didn’t realize all the trouble I was having in life was bc of adhd and it’s not just about being able to focus on a textbook. I was 38 when I finally started making some positive changes for myself 🥰"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes, 1000000%. I have deep-seated self-esteem issues and some really bad procrastination / anxiety due to all the times I didn't do something I should have done or wanted to do."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Hey! Welcome to diagnosis land! Welcome to “ohhhh now xyz makes sense” land! Welcome to “what if” land. 
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I was diagnosed at around 10 but only took retalin for a year and hated it so I stopped now 27 I decided to take meds again and got prescribed adderal and I’d say it’s life changing! Now I have a routine , my hygiene is the best it’s ever been and I feel very productive for instance every morning I eat take the pill and wait 40 minutes and go for a walk without hesitation  and my head is so clear when I walk . On weekends I don’t take it and I’m so slow and lazy and It takes me 2 hours just go push myself to go  ,and once I’m out my mind isn’t clear , even though I’m not thinking about anything . my blood sugar is waaay better because of this (t1 diabetic) and I’m extremely organized now."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Oh absolutely. I wish I'd even KNOWN I could possibly even have ADHD at all when I was younger. I grew into a drug addict trying to self-medicate for most of my life from my teen years without even knowing that that was what i was doing. I have never been able to hold down a job, a relationship, anything w any sort of consistency, I grew up thinking I was just an absolutely useless and crappy human being bc the things that my friends and family found so normal and easy were just so HARD for me to do and be consistent w. Turns out all that time I just had ADHD and was wired different and could have saved myself so much trauma if I'd have just know to approach things differently, never mind if I'd been able to have access to medication as well. 

Wow ... don't even want to think about it, honestly, that's a whole lifetime I'll never get back and there's not much I can do about that now. It's about what I can do going forward and for the future now, another lifetime that I hope will be a lot better, perhaps more peaceful at least lol."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes, I got diagnosed at 29, and I'm now 31, and in only 2 years I have witness how much potential was wasted in my years of struggling with ""being lazy"" and ""unfocused"". 

I even got my Master's degree while I was undiagnosed. When I look back to all my years in school, I feel like I could have avoided all the suffering and the feelings of worthlessness I experienced, if only I was given the right tools to succeed.

Even if you chose not to be medicated, just knowing that you have ADHD or any other disorder will help tremendously in getting the correct resources you need to be able to overcome your situation."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I was diagnosed when I was around 16. The psych recommended meds. My mom said, “Absolutely not”. I don’t blame her entirely, because I guess my brother was on Riddalin (sp?) years before and it “turned him into a zombie”. I wish she would have at least let me try it out first."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",I'm on a mix of guanfacine and elvanse. It's not good for your heart. My bp is a lot higher and my bpm is way up too
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Was diagnosed at 38 and yes, I can’t believe all the unnecessary struggles I had throughout my life because of my late diagnosis it. I had some benefits but I just never knew the things I was feeling or thinking were because I had adhd. I cried when I was first diagnosed - it was so eye opening"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Desperately so.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes.
Especially for college, and when my anxiety got really bad as I got older. It would have changed and helped a great many things."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I actually don't know.

I was an academically bright child. But my achievements were a bit erratic. I would excel tremendously on some subjects (math, language & literature, history, biology, geography, accounting) - to the point of representing the school in numerous competitions - but also fail miserably on some (chemistry and physics) - to the point that it was contemplated that I stay behind.

My teachers always commented how bright I am but distracted. To this extent, it sounds like had I been medicated early it might have been great. Maybe I would excel wonderfully in the corporate world (not doing bad but leaving that world now - my rebellious streak couldn't stand it anymore).

But I also suffer from CPTSD. Whatever neglect and emotional abuse my caregivers committed would not go away with medications. Jessica McCabe of How To ADHD has been medicated since she was very young but was never coached on how to manage her life with ADHD. She seems to be on a good path for her life now but she had talked several times on her struggles with ADHD *while being medicated*.

Don't get me wrong, I am currently medicated and a staunch proponent for getting the appropriate treatments, whatever it may be for the individual (meds, therapy, coaching, a mixture of all at a particular ratio, etc).

But I'm just questioning myself and trying to reflect, what difference could getting medicated early do to me? And would it be for the better or just different? This is of course besides the fact that, to this day, mental health is still a stigma in my home country. There was little possibility I would have been referred to an expert, let alone diagnosed and properly treated. I'm quite lucky that the country I'm residing now (and trying to get citizenship of) has good health coverage and some semblance of mental health awareness and care."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","1000% yes so i can at least achieve something solid for myself, now i feel too old to grind"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","To give you an experience on the flip side.

I was diagnoses when I was 6. My father had already one child before me with ADHD, so he quickly saw the sings and got me tested.

I got medicated retalin according to my weight.
But got socially isolated, timid, withdrawn, ate less and got a stunted growth.

The 'average' medication recommendation ended up being 3 times more than what I actually needed. 

As an underage, now timid boy, I did not know how to speak up, just completely accepting the diagnosis and recommendation of older individuals.

when I was 16 I started cutting the pill in half or skipping it, when I was 18 I got half dosage approved from the doctor. When I was 21. I started taking only half of that. And I was still focussing and more functional. 

Only at 26 I made a daring change to dexamphetamine (adderall). Which was the drug I should have taken at the beginning.

And now I am focussed and functional.

I understand the anger. But being diagnosed young, makes you also susceptible to wrongfull diagnosis. 

It took me 20 years to get the right drugs. Because when starting the drug I was too young to protest and afterwards my social development got insanely stunted, and I'm sure it affected my height.

Not being diagnosed until your age seems like hell. I hope my sad story can make you less sad about yours."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Would have saved me 10 years💀🤣
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Diagnosis at 38 years old. Do I wish it sooner? And what would that be for? I would like to take medication right now, but this shithole country I live in has nothing! No medication! only fucking strattera..."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Diagnosed at 42. Yes. It would have changed my life.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes!
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","yes probably. diagnosed at 35, I've broadly found medication too difficult to adapt to later in life because I had developed many non-medicated coping mechanisms."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I was diagnosed in my late 20s, and I'm 34 now. I've kind of inconsistently been on medication since my diagnosis for various reasons, primarily because I'm just uncomfortable being on medications long-term. 

But I do wish I was at least diagnosed *and understood* as a kid. I feel like it wasn't really being talked about or diagnosed when I was in grade school, or at least I wasn't really hearing about it until high school. And I don't think IEPs or anything really existed for anyone outside of the special needs classrooms. Ignoring the fact that I grew up poor, even if we had the money, my parents would not want their kid to be ""labeled"" in any way.

I was a straight A student...until I wasn't. High school hit and suddenly I wasn't the ""gifted"" student anymore. I couldn't wrap my head around the material, and couldn't articulate the right questions to try to get help. I spent HOURS sitting at the kitchen table, sometimes outright sobbing, because I WANTED to do my homework, but I just couldn't force myself to do it. It's so hard to explain to someone who hasn't experienced the literal inability to do something so basic.

It would have been so nice to have someone help me develop more tools for successful learning and studying, and I feel like that would have translated into more success as a working adult."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes a failed school
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I'm not entirely sure? I would think the development of good coping mechanisms in the absence of medication until medicated is a life lived having lifted weights heavier than everyone else.

Then you get medicated later in life and your knocking everything out of the park strating a thread such as pond ring this totally excellent question wondering if life would have been different had you been medicated earlier in life.

My hyperfocus passion is I.T. and the shit I have done in this field with very little prior knowledge in the absence of medication, is surprising to me and I'm sure it surprises others. If I'm tuned in, I damn near aquire the knowledge extraordinarily quickly."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",These posts are so funny man. Who would say no
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","yes, big-time, because I had no idea how bad it really was and still is. I would constantly do OK and middle school with grades and then I got the high school and I just hit the floor like I could comprehend the material. I could understand what we are doing, and to certain extent concentrate, but could never really focus on exactly what we were doing, regardless of the class, even if it was something that I was passionate about. It wasn’t until I got tested about seven or eight years ago that confirmed the diagnosis of ADHD. It wasn’t until my current and soon to be former APRN of psychiatric medicine, who is retiring soonin September to get me on Adderall 20 mg extended release that has made a world of difference in my life and I’m still struggling a lot with that but having a regular therapist outside of someone who prescribes that allows focus to be found in a productive way."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Diagnosed at 68! So much grieving over how different my life would’ve been. I can’t fault my parents because they, too, were undiagnosed and unaware. I leaned from them to manage my “symptoms” with alcohol and cigarettes! 

All I can say is once I grieved my loss, and accepted my limitations, I feel vindicated. I did the best I could growing up “feral”. 
On medication now and at peace with my life."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","No I’m glad I wasn’t on drugs for my early 30s I got diagnosed after I went to college 2nd time. I studied art which made me masks lot of my symptoms as ditzy or day dream or messy when in reality I needed to learn schedule and structure and- mindfulness therapy.

I learned a lot of coping mechanisms just developing them in my own. It’s still very hard it doesn’t get easier. 

There are days when I’m super depressed but also days when I’m like whatever I’m doing my best so fuck it. 

My parents didn’t know any better either but they tried. I think everyone in my family has it a little bit. That’s why for a lot of them formal schooling is hard.

I just found a Subject I absolutely loved- unconditionally and without hesitation went for it. It was actually better that I didn’t know there was something amiss with me. 

Since I didn’t know- I also didn’t have self blame. Or as harsh inner critic. So I just wandered and tried a billion things."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yeah, I would have been a lot smarter and would have probably  graduated college by now"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","This is a very normal thing to feel, i think we all mourn what could have been, all the suffering we had to endure in vain. I have come to terms with it though. I recognize that i got the diagnosis at all along with medication is an improvement in my life."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Definitely. Many things about my professional and my personal Life (partners etc.) would have been positively impacted.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",[removed]
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I’m not sure if this is because of the medication, but I’ve had huge problems with getting out of bed lately, after 1.5 years on adderall. I’m groggy and I’m lazy and I simply can’t cope. I don’t know  how I would have coped as a child, I think I would have exploded with rage if my parents tried to force me out of bed in that state.

For me I think behavioural changes from the diagnosis would have been more helpful, but I can appreciate that I’m not usually an extreme case and I get by day-to-day OK, if a bit late to everything."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","That’s how old I was when I was diagnosed with ADD ( what it was called back then -  40 yrs ago). It definitely caused a lot of unpleasant incidents. Erratic grades in school. Got in a lot of fights. Was called the little monster by my older brothers. Then in college I’d forget classes I had registered for. Imagine taking a final exam for a class you never attended.  No cell phones either. If you aren’t home to get a phone call you’d miss it. I forgot a few girls I was going out with. Yeah or I really liked. Ran into her 9
Months later w a new boyfriend. Asked me what happened. I didn’t  have an answer. I forgot I knew her.  I couldn’t keep track. Forgot dates of jobs and lost them. Lots of temper tantrums and severe alienation. I spent about a decade with nary a friend. I broke out of it by studying acting. I had been antisocial. When I hear the complaints of ppl with ADHD now they seem  so minor compared to a world where Adhd didn’t exist as a recognized disability. No Ritalin. So many  lost jobs and opportunities. Lost friends. No help understanding or learning.  I was dyslexic to boot. I remember when they changed it from add to ADHD. When I was a child they said I was hyperkinetic or hyper-tense. I forget. I always got bad grades in cooperation if you can believe they had grades for that  back then, but  they did. I got in a lot of trouble. My dad was adhd. Terrible temper. Always angry and threatening."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes! I was diagnosed last week, I’m in my mid 40s. My life has improved since. Just knowing what’s going on with me has made our home life so much better. I have more patience with myself now and even hubby is doing better now that he knows I’m not constantly screwing things up on purpose. It’s made him a lot more loving too. I wish I’d been diagnosed when my GP tried the first time when I was 14. It’s taken me 30 years to find a doctor who could truly help me. I’m not the same woman he met and married, I’m a more improved version now. Less jumpy, more calm and quirky AF. The diagnosis has completely changed my life, I wish I’d gotten it much sooner"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes even though I was tested twice once as a child and once as an adult I was not put on meds. Now I’m on vyvanse and I feel so much better! I’m so sad for the life I could have had.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","How do you expect your parents to know better when you lived over 20 years as an adult, who is more tech savvy and has the internet underneath his fingertips, yet it still took you this long to suspect you might have ADHD?

Medication does improve things, but there are plenty of people with ADHD who also do not have degrees. And plenty of people without AHDD who do not have degrees and their life was very similar, worse, or better than yours.

The mentality you have right now is in my opinion toxic and not good for you. If anything, be excited that now you can pursue whatever degree you want. You've been living life on hard mode and struggled, and now supposedly it should be easy mode. Nothing is holding you back anymore, so look forward.

Good luck."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Not for me, I like to think the resilience, discipline, and the drive from repeated failures and living a tough early life would not have been able to come into play and shape me into who I am today had I been diagnosed/medicated. I understand not everyone’s experience is the same. This is mine. Now being medicated consistently in my late 20s, I get the best of both worlds. The skills and character I built up to this point unmedicated, to now the focus and drive into navigating my adult life and still having an a opportunity to run a successful business that I could only fathom as a dream at the time. I’ve learned to cultivate that dream into a reality, hopefully looking for success. If not I can at least say that I tried, something that I can confidently say I would not have done had I been medicated. I would’ve most likely just followed the straight and narrow path of a degree and a 9-5 (not saying there’s anything wrong with that) but I’m one class away from transferring to a 4 year and completing the necessities of obtaining a degree in a study of my choice. That’s my “back up” plan at this point, if the ship does in fact sink. But who knows, I say all this now and maybe had I been medicated since childhood things would be in an even better shape. I’m not a fortune teller unfortunately. Just my experience. I believe in fate as well as being able to control the direction of where my life goes. That doesn’t cancel out fate however. I can be thriving beyond my wildest dreams for a couple years and it all coming crashing down leaving me in an even worser position than before… you just never know…"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",100% yes.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I don’t necessarily wish I had been on meds, but I DO wish I had been diagnosed earlier. I felt like I was swimming against a current my whole life that everyone else didn’t have to deal with. I think if I had been taught the coping skills I have now, my life would’ve turned out very differently."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I was diagnosed at about 26 (I know, younger than 36+) but yes. It would've really helped me during school, friends, communities, university, and mental health. Looking back I can see why I was more outcast, or why my failures failed. Think I would've had a more successful life & more self-esteem sooner"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Wow,,I feel so sorry for all the people in this post who have been diagnosed so late in life.

"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I think that may have helped, yeah. I drove myself to damn near madness a few months ago(diagnosed 2 weeks ago, at age 44)

"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Not really. I am happy with where I am in life (39f) despite knowing I could have achieved more (graduated college for example). I found my own way and am proud of it.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","No one ever believed me when I said I had ADD bc I was a straight A student.

"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes. A thousand times yes.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I was diagnosed at 30, after having completed K-12 education, plus paramedic school and nursing school. Looking back, I think I would have had an easier time studying at least in nursing school if I had been medicated for it. I did really well in K-12 school, but I can definitely see where a lot of common ADHD traits were present (I lost a lot of notes and assignments, procrastinated to the last possible second on almost everything, was very disorganized 99% of the time, etc) but because I was a nerdy, teacher's pet, I got given a pass by the teachers a lot of the time where other students might not have been given the same grace. I'm proud that I was able to overcome the adversity of having the struggles that I do and still ultimately succeed in nursing and medic school, but I definitely encourage anyone who hasn't been evaluated for it, who thinks they even \*might\* have ADHD to get evaluated and get the supports in place that could help them succeed (like medications and extra time for tests) if they're going to undertake something big like a nursing or medic program."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I would not be the person I am today if I did not have the experiences prior to be being diagnosed at 42. However I think that it would have made many things clearer to address.. like it was not just depression or anxiety…or I was not just always overly sensitive…
I think it shows that lack of understanding and empathy at times with medical professionals. There was criteria for ADHD diagnosis that I felt they emphasized in certain populations, but then in others completely ignored."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I could have been a doctor.

Or bought a house.

There’s no way I have kids in this version of my life, but the version I am medicated? Definitely an option."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes 10000000000%
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","God yes.   

Everyone in my life failed me as a child. Parents, teachers, doctors; NO ONE thought for a second that there might be REASON for my (sometimes extreme) behavioral issues.
If SOMEONE had realized what was going on and I had gotten some help then, I could have had a much different life today.   

My biggest regret was that in spite of always being the smartest kid in class (I argued a math point with my eighth grade teacher and won), I never pursued a university education. I always got the grades by acing my tests but project work, group work, and especially homework I consistently under performed and I was heavily criticized for it. My sixth grade teacher even told me (in front of the whole class mind you) to ""drop the absent minded professor routine"".

If I'd had gotten the support I needed back then, I'd be Dr. Goodchild, PhD today. Probably physics or pure math, maybe computer science. Instead, I settled for community college in computer engineering and graduated as a technologist. I ended up in an unremarkable career in IT that eventually crushed me and sent me spiraling into depression that I'm just now starting to get under control."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","ABSOLUTELY!! We can't change the past but I 100% agree. I too struggle to not dwell on my past and any relationships that my ADHD may have ruined had I just known I suffered from anxiety and ADHD. By the time I realized it, it was too late to save my relationship and I think it might eat at me  for the rest of my life."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","For me, no. Meditation is one tool to help you but it's not a cure all. When I was younger I didn't know about executivee functions. I developed so many coping skills and work arounds when I was younger and wasn't medicated. As I have gotten older my adhd has definitely gotten worse. I don't know if it's because of social media or a heavier stress load or hormones but it definitely got worse. I'm grateful I have the coping mechanisms I developed when I was younger. Now that I know about executive functions, my coping skills now make total sense. One example is I've been body doubling since high school and had no idea that's what I was doing. I just knew I wouldn't get through my classes without a study partner or group."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Not that old, I was diagnosed at 30, but I struggle with this question.


On one hand, being diagnosed as a kid probably would have made my life so much better. I would have done way better in school, probably went to a way better college and not taken 7 years to graduate. I probably would have stuck with my path to becoming a lawyer and probably would be a bit more financially stable since I wouldn’t have started my career so late and in a higher paying field.


On the other hand, I’m pretty happy with my life now. I moved and got to experience life in a big city, I enjoy my career, and, most importantly, i met my fiance in the new city.


So, if someone offered me a Time Machine to go back and get diagnosed at 10 years old or something, but I’d never meet my fiance, my answer would be a firm “no”"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I’m 22 but I’m in my last semester of nursing school. I did high school without many struggles so I had no idea what was coming for me when college came around. Before college the most i had ever studied for a test was maybe a couple hours the morning of. The first couple semesters weren’t too hard, I didn’t change my (lack of) studying habits and I was struggling a bit in some areas but still making it. Then I hit the second semester of nursing school. 4 classes, lab, check offs, exams, clinicals….. I could NOT keep up. I failed and retook a couple classes, and then finally moved up after taking one class 3 times because I genuinely couldn’t pay attention to a class I didn’t care about (OB). I’m finally in my last semester and after my first 100 question exam I knew I had to do something. I barely failed it, but i could FEEL myself just completely losing all focus at about 35 questions in. I had a pediatrician tell my parents that I “probably have ADHD but won’t diagnose because I don’t like giving these meds to kids”. Always did good in school so nobody really cared to look further into it. Went to the doctor like two months ago, got put on adderall, have been doing better than I ever have. IN MY LAST SEMESTER. I struggled so hard to get here, and i literally didn’t have to. (have also been dealing with unbearable fatigue and have been going to doctors for 3 years trying to figure it out. they have all associated it with my POTS and said not much we can do sorry. the adderall has made it so much better, I cried the first day I took it bc I could literally feel a weight being lifted off of my body)."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","OP i'm 37, got some kind of diagnostic about 30 years ago.
I'm also Asperger (diagnostic at 18), anxious ect

I also take ritalin, try a lot of them.

Nothing is magic 
I'm not sure if it because I had an early diagnostic, but I read some of you with your medication and it seem magic. 

Ritalin an such are just like a pair of glasses, hear that many many years ago never fully understand it until 2 year ago when I decide to got glasses bc of too many computer screen hour. It will help you but it just a support. 

Would you have a degree ? i don't ! It take me 6 years to do 2/3.... Didn't want to do it at the end. 


 it was very rare at ""our"" time to talk about ADHD. 
It become more common +/- 15-20 years ago. It would still be a ""late"" diagnostic for you

Angry at you parent..maybe it ok...if they know about it and refuse to go see a doctor.. To confirme it."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Diagnosed at 35, but didn’t get the proper meds until this past ~year. I try not to focus on what could have been. About being diagnosed, but also generally about most things. I keep that as a mantra for my life and it’s served me well. (Thanks, Lion King)

Ultimately, it doesn’t matter, because we can’t change the past. We can only focus on what we can control. And what you have ahead of you is a whole lot more control than you’ve ever had. So focus all of your energy on what you’re able to do now and all of the exciting ways your life is going to change. 

As for my parents, I don’t hold a grudge. You remember back then, adhd was not really well known or understood (and still doesn’t feel that way today in a lot of ways). I have never looked at it from the lens of them not caring, just not having the tools from education, society, or medical professionals to be able to help me or even know there was something wrong. I hope you can find a way through that as well. 

And despite having had a lot of negative experiences that shaped me growing up, that probably yeah, could have turned out much different, I am who I am now because all of that. I learned a lot of ways to take care of myself and be resilient, and even if I shouldn’t have had to do that, it serves me well now. 

It’s natural to feel angry or lament the what if’s, so it’s ok if you don’t feel the same way I do. But I hope my perspective helps, if not now, then someday.

Edit: fixed some tangled, early morning out of order thoughts lol"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","No, because I managed to have a happy meaningful life without the meds.  I am glad I got diagnosed when I did, (age 70) and the meds are incredibly helpful in my current situation, where I caregive for a sick spouse, and he needs a very quiet routine, and has a complex medication schedule.  If I accidently skip my ritalin, I can't get it done without mistakes.  I am afraid that if I had been diagnosed, I wouldn't have created a life around my strenghts, and I would have made more money, and gotten along better is jobs I hated, and I wouldn't have been forced to figure out how to make a living as an artist.  I've had a great life, period.  I am 74, and I guess I have come to terms with any regrets.  I think the biggest thing I have learned from being an undiagnosed ADHD person who had to figure out how to deal with our society as it is, is do not judge others.  And don't be an asshole, we are all doing the best we can."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I managed to ace through school, probably because I had a punishing physical schedule of and hour cycling before school doing my paper route, then cycling to school, drinking coffee, exercise at school then cycling home and probably an hour extra physical after school - walking, ball games, skating, etc etc.. I just about kept myself on track, with all the classic report phrases about applying myself and being distracted. With the right teacher and some interesting subject matter I could hyper focus and fly - sometimes top of the class. In fact I was the star pupil for the subject I then went on to university to study.
Things unraveled once there however, and I couldn’t ever find a way to regulate myself other than heavy drinking and with the change in immediate emotional relationships, poverty and a very poor diet, I soon found it impossible to organize my studies and concentrate on my work for more than 5 minutes, even though I could hyper focus some of the time and I enjoyed the actual learning about the fascinating topic.
It all came to a head when I couldn’t pay rent or eat and study for the final
exams. I went on a bit of a sabbatical, abandoned all my friends, my rented house with all my stuff and just walked away into a new life for a few years, no fixed abode, crashing on couches and partying for years. It was brutal in terms of not being able to earn money for comfort and planning and food, and eventually I got an admin job and could get enough coffee and exercise to just about keep hold of it. I did this until I was 30 then learned to build websites- hyperfocus, coffee and working at home.
That was 25 years ago and not until 7 years ago did I even have any real knowledge of adhd. As soon as I got medicated it was like I had stepped off a very wobbly skateboard that had been lpermanently attached to my feet.
It was very clear to me how other people from all the previous walks of life I had been through could plan a goal and stick to the small steps required to get there. And so off they had gone with their degrees and many of them are in very lucrative and senior positions in industry. People I know I had kept up with or exceeded at college, but who had been able to organize themselves and work hard. And well done then, I couldn’t be happier.
But there’s a good part of me that is looking back at 18 year old me, across the gulf between us that were essentially lost years, and shrugging at him as I recall the dreams I had when I was starting out.
All to play for now though :)"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes! Especially in college.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Absolutely. I was in and out of college so many times. Took me forever to figure out how to get my homework done. Got diagnosed two years after graduating. Lots of people go to college for 8 years…
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes x1000000
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","hard to say - i was diagnosed, which lines up with my experiences, but none of the medications did a damn thing for me.  The only thing that has ever worked for me I stumbled on, which was basically using a small amount of that Colombian white powder - focus, concentration, determination, etc....all just lines up. Funny i never liked it for partying - but alas can't use it cuz you know...

I wish stuff like Adderal, Ritalin etc had the same effec.

I wish you good luck- now you have new days ahead of you!"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes!
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I have my assessment this weekend, it’s been 4 years in the works but it’s finally here. Since I looked at myself as potentially having ADHD, my life has changed entirely. How I look at myself and treat myself is very different. At first I didn’t even want a diagnosis because I didn’t like the idea of being medicated “changing me” but as I get older and deeper into a career that I love, have more responsibilities than more than just myself, somehow own a home etc, it seems like the wisest idea to set myself up to succeed while I still can."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes absolutely. It would’ve stopped all the noise and I could’ve reached my goal
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I have been through the same thing,  and I have more than just ADHD. My school tried to convince my parents that I had some kind of learning disability, but they dismissed it and told me I was just lazy. Later in my youth I got into legal troubles,  a lot of hard drug use and have also developed MDD and PTSD . My mother passed away 3 months ago and I do feel bad , she had a stroke and as much as I resented her for my upbringing methods I still miss her and realize how short are time is here and that we are all human , we make mistakes and not all things are worth holding onto resentment over ..."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I'm wondering.

It's hard to imagine all the roads that life could have taken ""if [...] "". I bet I would have done the same stupid things.

I would have appreciated being diagnosed and medicated Before having a kid... It would have made some things easier."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I was diagnosed at 30, 37 now. I was angry at first, and in some ways lament at the life I think I could have had. But the fact is, before I was diagnosed I was led by my passions completely (for better or for worse) and I am so proud of her for all that she accomplished. I lived hard because I felt it all (and had no emotional training other than to be quiet), and despite it, I am grateful I met so many parts of myself along the way. 
Could I be more together with my emotions, dedications, and life had I been diagnosed earlier? Heck yes! But where I’m at, there is wisdom in my experiences I don’t think I would have been able to reach otherwise. I’m just happy I am still alive lol 
I don’t know if I would know myself as well as I do if I didn’t begin my relationship with medication later in life. In considering (and hoping) that I still have a lot of life to go, I think I found my diagnosis at a good time in my own relationship with myself."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes. I think my childhood would’ve been less traumatic. I would remember more of it, for sure. There’s sooo much I’m picking up the pieces of now… the unmasking is so painful. Audhd here."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes. Would have helped a lot. School was pain and I think it's a bit miracle I did not turn alcoholic.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I do. Of course, I also wish I'd been told when I was younger. My mother found out when I was a child, and never said or did anything. When I was officially diagnosed at 42 - after my own pursuits - my primary doctor said that he knew because it was already in my medical records. Had I known sooner (even as a kid), I would've pursued medication (ongoing therapy, at the least0."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Oh yeah!! I feel this 💯 after starting therapy with amphetamines.. I wish I would have started sooner, would have been such a better student.. but I'm sure yours like mine were trying to do their best! Mine tried to get me into therapy but I never made any progress."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",No because meds have been disastrous. They only work for 70% of us. I found out when I was 63.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Probably not, tbh. My poor brother was diagnosed at 9yo and put on Ritalin for four years; it made him incredibly depressed and was one of the most difficult and disconnected times for our family. This was the early '90s so Ritalin was all they threw at it, and I myself responded badly to stimulant meds when we tried them in my mid 30s. 

Am now on a combo of Zoloft and Wellbutrin which helps me manage my symptoms better than anything else I've tried. Tackling the chemistry of emotional dysregulation first helps me be objective when working through (and reacting to) executive dysfunction, time blindness, etc."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes a thousand times yes
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes! Last few years would’ve been much more easier lol! 

Just got diagnosed last month, 39 years old… 20mg/day Vyvanse and it’s completely changed my dad to day life and outlook! Wish I was diagnosed years ago!"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes and no. 

I got diagnosed at 40. 

Before the thought of ADHD had come to me, I thought I was just a late boomer. I did learn coping skills -- very slowly and painfully -- and developed a lot of little life hacks that are pretty similar to typical ADHD advice... Now that I'm starting meds, I'm well at up to really take off. Pills don't build skills, sure, but now that I've got some skills from the school of hard knocks... I'm ready to be turbo charged! 

My hyper focus and quick thinking in emergencies has served me well pre diagnosis."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes, I had 18 jobs in 10 years after leaving school, got meds, been in the last 2 jobs for the past 13 years.

I still can't focus enough to study, I've failed many times because I can't focus enough to finish assignments, and really scared to spend more money to learn what I love.

I can't blame my parents, they did the best they could with the information they had available.

Be sure to remember that people behave based on their experiences and beliefs."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I felt this way at first. But the past is the past. I wish I was on meds now. My doctor took me off them when I had a bad experience with antidepressants. Honestly, I've not gotten anything done since. Totaled a car cause I wasn't paying attention to the road, lost a good job, and started washing dishes at a local restaurant. Life is kind of a mess with ADHD for sure."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","To be honest ....

No .... 

I went through hell and back through my rawest and purest emotions .... 

Would I repeat .... If I have to but not recommendable

But if I have to be there for another family member .... I'm now prepared to be their ROCK or PILLAR of support"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",I honestly felt so much anger when I was diagnosed because of how different my life could have been if I was diagnosed before 25. I struggled in school and teachers always made me feel stupid and told me “you just aren’t applying yourself”. I loved learning but I literally couldn’t focus and always ended up sitting in the hallway because I didn’t “get it” or got frustrated. I’m absorbing all the knowledge I can now and making sure no adult or child feels the way I felt back then.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes and no.

I wish I had been medicated in college. I’m glad I wasn’t in graduate school.

I wouldn’t have been as successful as I am without nearly failing out of graduate school. I learned what I did not want to be during those couple of years. Graduated, but basically lost all respect for anyone who taught there because of how they treated what I now know to have been effectively a disability.

Glad I wasn’t medicated in high school. Without using rage as a coping mechanism for getting things done, I might have stayed in my hometown instead of getting the hell out and going to a Top 10 college."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",51 before diagnosis… they would have changed my life if I’d been diagnosed in college
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Medication might have helped, yea...

But honestly I think therapy from like age 12 would've done much more for me xD I've been in therapy for 2 over 2 years now after depression and burnout and I'm still not properly back up on my feet. Medication only helps so much."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Of course, but what can we really do. Look forth, salvage what you can."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes. The things I could have accomplished/avoided... I don't even want to think about it.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Oh yea. They told my dad I had something when I was 7. I got meds at 39. But the past is the past no do overs. I just wish I had better coping skills. I had decades to could have gotten real help. 

Move forward my friends move forward"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","ABSOLUTELY. I was 47 and well into perimenopause when I was *finally* diagnosed... so even though I was almost immediately medicated, it did next to nothing because my estrogen levels were already flailing.

I would LOVE to know what Adderall or Vyvanse are actually capable of doing for me, and I would have LOVED to have some relief before I painted my whole life into a corner. 😫"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Getting diagnosed and medicated really helped me work more efficiently. Like the mode change from Hard to Normal ;)
I don’t think I really needed that as a kid or a teen - I did good, have lovely supportive parent and In hindsight- very good teachers who kept me engaged and interested and I didn’t need to mask as much."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes, wholeheartedly. I would have likely been able to finish my degree two years faster at *least* and be *significantly* less in education debt; my finances, a lifetime of bad coping strategies that I have barely dug myself out of? Yeah. I can't say I'd own a house, but honestly I might even have a condo instead of a studio with no real kitchen. Better relationships with my family, friends, ability to *keep* friends, fewer problems with binge eating...

Yeah.

I really fucking FUCKING wish that I had been on meds when I was younger, and it was a longer grieving process after diagnosis than I would have liked dealing with the... 'how did no one *notice*. How did they not see how fucking badly I needed help.' (I understand the reasons, this is a rhetorical question as I've dealt with it now, but.... being able to understand something intellectually and make peace with it are two VERY different things)"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Diagnosed with ADHD and given medication at 43. Diagnosed with autism at 44. Still on ADHD medication. Medication earlier on would no doubt have helped. 

But more so receiving the diagnoses. Having some kind of framework for understanding myself and what was going in any aspect of life. Why and how I function the way I do. A framework that did not begin and end with “I’m broken and cannot be fixed”.

Yes. Correct meds earlier on would no doubt have helped. But more so the diagnoses."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","52. My life is a smoking hole in the ground, but hey, at least I know that 95% of it wasn't my fault. 


Here's to late middle age, my new start in life 🙄"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Don’t be so quick to fault your parents. My parents DID take me to a psyc doc (this was in the 80s), I was diagnosed, put on a special diet, and I was prescribed Ritalin, at a very low dose. The first round of meds didn’t work. Dr increased the milligrams, still didn’t work. This went on for 3 months. After the 3rd month, my parents thought that I would eventually become an “addict” and I would “grow out of” my ADHD. I’m 51 years old. I’ve had some struggles. I was re-diagnosed and prescribed meds, 15 years ago. It changed my life! ADHD and the awareness, to this very day, STILL does not get the exposure it needs. My parents weren’t educated, especially when it came psychology. We have better technology now vs. back then, 
but people still don’t take ADHD seriously. "
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yep. The part I didn't realize was ADHD-driven was the emotional dysregulation, so I've been a basket case most of my life when I didn't have to be. I'm the most emotionally stable I've ever been, and the diagnosis led me to DBT as a therapeutic technique. I wouldn't have known it was a thing, and I probably wouldn't have been able to implement the strategies as well without meds. It's all helped tremendously, and I feel like my life would have been MUCH easier if I'd had support for this earlier. The rest of my troubles I can mostly mask, compensate, or strategize into submission (at least long enough to get something done), but the emotional control was the missing piece."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Diagnosed at 40, and it explained a host of past experiences.  Would have probably changed my life in a huge way for the better if I had the diagnosis at a younger age, but it wasn't well known.  I'm 61 now and I struggle with it no less now, even though I take medication.  I can't blame my parents, since my dad has it and he didn't know until after I found out I had it.   

ADHD was and still is very poorly understood by many who were/are responsible for diagnosis and treatment and many a psychiatrist that I interviewed to help me get meds had less knowledge than I did.   The symptoms supposedly vary by individual, but I know that I'll never ""cure"" (escape) mine because it is just how my brain functions.  God, how I wish my brain's executive function was normal, but wishing it won't make it so.  If there's a rabbit hole anywhere in the area, I sure as hell will find it.  

Oh, and the med side effects!   Nausea, jitters, and anger.   I learned Madderall is a slang term for a reason, and though I thought it was working for me and I was finally getting things done, I didn't know that my personality had changed dramatically.  When my wife told me I was angry and short tempered all the time, I thought she was crazy.  Then I asked some others, and sure enough, I had started acting like a king sized Dick.  Ask your loved ones to tell you if your personality changes, because if they think it's not safe to do so, they might just decide to avoid you.

I finally have the experience to know when I can wait before taking my Concerta so that it works when I need it to, or to have an extra dose or half dose when I know it's not going to last, but that experience was hard won.   I have empathy for anyone going through the ADHD maze for the first time because I know how much time I've devoted to overcoming it and understanding how it affects me, and yet I still continue to have to work at it all the time.  I would've liked to have had some help in high school before I developed a million bad habits."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I think this is a fascinating question and something I’m really struggling with myself. 

I’m 39 and just been diagnosed and finally started treatment. The experience has been profound and made me reflect a lot. On the one hand I’m full of regret about unmet potential but on the other hand I’m wondering what I would have missed out on if I got treated earlier. 

For example, I gave up a career in academia because it just did not work with my ADHD symptoms. I felt very sad at the time because I love science but knew the amount of effort that it would have taken to overcome my weaknesses (restlessness to jump from one topic to the next, inattention to detail, procrastination, poor focus, etc) would have been awful for me. Now on the meds, I can’t help but think, what if… 

That said, in pursuit of stimulation I followed my heart and did largely what I found interesting. In academia I was more creative than my peers. After leaving academia my pursuit of stimulation has culminated in a job which I really enjoy, find rewarding but would never have got to if I didn’t allow my ADHD to guide my decisions. It probably isn’t the “best” I could have achieved in my career but equally it’s unique, varied and interesting.

In terms of my personal life my biggest regret is not sticking with interests and hobbies but jumping from one to the other and when the hyper focus ran out just ditching it. Again, part of me wishes I’d stuck with something to see how good I could have been. The flip side though is I jumped around a lot and got a decent exposure to a range of things which has broadened my life and I don’t know if I’d have got this if I’d been medicated sooner. 

There are other examples but these give you an idea of the conflict I’m wrestling with. I could definitely have “achieved more” on treatment but what would I have missed out on?"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes!
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes. I really really do. And therapy.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes 31M on stimmys for 2 months now and 100% wish I had these when I was a kid. This is life changing in ways that only people on this thread can comprehend and so much of my life would have been better if I could function
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","What angers me are parents today that have kids that  very obviously have ADHD and they categorically refuse to get them diagnosed and medicated because I know how that child will feel as an adult when and if they finally get medicated.  

To answer your question more directly, yes... I compared the feeling I had as Grief. Greaving the life that could....  That was a very sad day for me... (Diagnosed at 41)"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",That medicine is no good for any of us. 😡
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","You can go to school now. You are an adult. Stop blaming your parents, they did what they could with what they knew."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes. This is why I’m having a super hard time with current parents tiptoeing around getting meds to their kids. 

I get the fear and sense of responsibility, but they are missing the utter despair and self loathing that a life unmedicated can bring. And if they could see what that feels like and looks like, I bet all parents would put their teenagers or young adult kids on meds asap."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Diagnosed at 36 and yes absolutely. It could’ve helped me a lot. But not bitter. And mostly proud I accomplished what I did without being diagnosed / medicated.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","If I were diagnosed in 4th grade—this was parochial school in 1984, so it was never likely on any timeline—and given the medicine then?

I’d be in charge. Maybe not in charge of EVERYTHING, but I would have a little piece. I would be a respectable man. 

Yes, I wish it."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Medication has been life changing, but I think the knowing what’s happening with my brain has been the biggest help. If I’m having paralysis, knowing that it’s ADHD and not my being worthless and lazy has helped me power through the inertia. 

Being kinder and more understanding to myself makes me a much kinder person."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yes, it would have been so much help. I really see the difference with my children who both have ADHD. On their meds they can accomplish so much. Forget a day or two and nothing gets done and the emotional deregulation is off the charts."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes!!!
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Without a doubt.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Absolutely!!!
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Absolutely yes, diagnosed less than a year ago and only a handful of months away from 39. Primarily inattentive so I think it would have been really hard to catch back then looking back. Especially considering I all but knew myself when quarantine hit in 2020, but still fought it until recently. No blame or negative feelings towards my parents as they were and continue to be amazing. In fact a lot of the constant, little supports they always gave really kept me as grounded as I could be.

I was a pretty well above average student, but where everyone around me thought I made it look effortless it was anything but that. I can't tell you how I loved hearing if I would really apply myself, I could meet my real potential. Meds would have been amazing when college came along as all those routines got blown up with the freedom college brings, but I did more than good enough. It took recently going to grad school and all those years of experience to make the change and I wish I would have sooner.

I am happy with the person I am and where I find myself in life and I consider myself lucky this is the case. That said I still grieve not what could have been but things like the fact that I don't really celebrate my success like others do. Its just a relief that I handled any big task and then promptly move along. Other than when its just my wife and me or maybe 3 select friends I wonder how much of my personality is really ""my,"" personality and how much is just what I feel like the person I'm around wants or needs. I'm happy that I've seemingly gotten to the point where I'm free of the stress I put on myself due to my often overamplified perceptions of others, but I'll never get the time it took to get here. These are the things that make me wish I knew another path was there to take."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Without a doubt. It’s one of my greatest regrets. I was diagnosed at 7, but my parents didn’t believe in medication, so my chance to have a fairly normal life died that day."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Dear god yes. I cannot believe how much I struggled and didn’t understand why because I was always told I was “smart.” I dropped out of college so many times. Always overwhelmed. Medication and even just general knowledge about how my brain works would have been life-altering. I honestly cried when I first realized how hard life had been when it didn’t need to be.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","From a career perspective I wish I'd had meds as a child/teen so I could get qualifications and go to uni which I most definitely need to progress. But I actually don't want anything to change. My life has unexpectedly turned out pretty great. It's kind of like I don't know what I'm missing so as far as I'm aware, this is even better than it could have been."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Hell yeah… might have avoided the unintended kid, the divorce, the stroke… there’s been too much impulsive, unnecessary suffering."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Yes. My life would be drastically different. I’d be much more successful.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Diagnosed last year at 50. No, no meds at all. I just wish that my parents and teachers were aware of it. It wasn’t something even talked about in the 1980s. It became much more known just after I (barely) graduated high school in 1990.

Instead of being labeled as ""lazy"" or ""has potential but doesn't use it"" or ""really smart but a major discipline problem"" the adults in my life understood what was going on under the hood, so to speak, would have helped my struggles and self-esteem.

Luckily, I was able to spot identical symptoms in my 7 year old son in spite of his naysaying mother. He's on a path of help with a doting dad who understands him and what he's experiencing. He won't be medicated."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","As someone who WAS appropriately medicated from a young age, I can confirm it WAS life altering, and amazing. My mother said that the first time I took medication (age 7) was the first time she had a FULL conversation with me. I was still a weird kid, but now I wasn't rearranging the classroom chairs and desks because I HAD AN IDEA, and I could focus through an entire math worksheet. 


My friend was at her wits end with her daughter, the pandemic really derailed the early intervention that she would have had access to years earlier, and finally has her daughter on medication and everyone (especially the daughter!) is so much happier, relaxed, etc. Emotional regulation is much smoother, impulses less violent, she is MAKING FRIENDS and her reading level is SOARING. I cried with her, we're so grateful she has A CHANCE to grow and learn in a more typical, less struggle-filled manner."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Diagnosed at 66. What a dif.

"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",“Hard Mode” is such a good way to describe it.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","My kid’s psychiatrist said to his Dad, who needed a lot of convincing, pretty much the exact same thing. “Why would you set up your child to have to always work in hard mode? It’s not character building, it’s kind of cruel.”"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Same with me. I was moved from one SSRI to another for 10 years. The Dr's never believed when I told them that the meds did nothing.

Got diagnosed as bipolar at 25 then ADHD at 35. Vyvanse has fixed basically every problem I had with depression. It doesn't exist at all at this point in my life with Seroquel at night and Vyvanse in the morning.

Having said that, I like the person I am today. I prefer to believe that going through all that was how I have such an intricate understanding of myself. I still get manic every now and then but I notice it now because I lived with it so long. If I was treated properly in my teens I don't know that I would notice it the way I do now.

With Vyvanse, I have actually been able to take my Seroquel dosage down. I can't explain why it makes sense but I know it has changed my life for the better.

Edit: To add to this video games really help me when I get stuck in a thought pattern. Super Kirby Clash has become my go to. The matches require my full attention and they only last about 5 minutes. After 15 minutes that thought I couldn't get rid of is gone. It works every time."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I've been calling it Prestige Mode. There's been so many instances where things could have easily turned out poorly. I was just diagnosed two months ago, medicine a month ago. I'm 45."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","This, this right here is exactly how I described my life to other people after starting meds. I had just never realized it until I had something to help me. 

Also I'm very glad you went back and tried again and found something that worked for you!"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Initial bad experiences with meds caused me to wait 16 years to get evaluated for real. I feel your pain.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Dx at 36. The grieving process, as it were, went by fairly quickly. Even 2+ years on I'm still experiencing moments of wonder that I can do the thing. 

As they say, the best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago. The second best time is today.

Or: only assholes have perfect hindsight"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Same here. I gave up looking for a medication that doesn’t make life worse. Knowing would’ve been enough.

"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",This one right here
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",This is how I saw it initially as well. I was able to reason almost immediately that how could my parents have done any better when the medical community itself knew so little about inattentive ADHD and how it presented in women?
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Absolutely the grieving. I was diagnosed at 43 year. I felt so much grief. Being called the naughty kid. Struggling to maintain friendships. Just basically always being told I was difficult.  So much blame  and shame piled on my young self. 
Luckily I’m quite intelligent so managed to go back to school and uni and post grads etc after dropping out of high school. My psych kindly said to me that it all requires so much kudos to me cause I had to do that all on my own when everything would have been so so hard for me. 
Goodness life could have been so much easier.."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I agree. I'm 56 and just got diagnosed and medicated a few months ago. I've been much more productive at work lately. 

I wish I had known in college."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",I am also 54. I have all of my school reports…every teacher commented on my inability to pay attention. I need to get a formal evaluation. Was it expensive?
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I'm 59 and undiagnosed. I can't imagine being angry at anybody but if (as someone smartly said above) it switches life from hard mode to easy mode, I'll be excited to see what I can achieve.

I've never been a success at anything. It's like I'm wired towards expecting failure based on all the evidence that's gone before. I tried my heart out at school and got 'O' levels through sheer determination to please my dad - I'd spend forty hours a week in school holidays and 20 hours a week when at school just memorising the things I needed to. 

Even then I only scraped seven passes. All my mates got ten and at much better grades with far less effort. 

'A' levels were beyond me. I assumed that I was just a bit thick. Memorising information is not necessarily understanding information. I gave up at 16, though I did three years further education, and to my family I was a waster.

I'm called an underachiever by my bosses at work. Some say that I should try to better myself but to what end? I don't like pressure, deadlines, responsibility for others, learning anything new, groupthink managerial bullshit, competing, back stabbing and everything else that goes with the positions above me. So many of them are narcissistic.

I'd love to be correctly diagnosed one day and land on the right medication and learn beneficial lifestyle alterations for where I'm at. Perhaps medication isn't part of the solution for me but it would be interesting if something gets 'unlocked' and I achieve something before I die as a result.

Being able to play the blues harp would do me. I've spent thousands of hours trying down the years but just cannot play from the diaphragm or tongue block. My brain just cannot move on from the errors it is familiar with.

I did once play the synthesiser brilliantly in front of a witness whilst high on mushrooms. I hit the right notes on both hands and just felt the music, making a tune up as I went. She wasn't high and assumed I had a hidden talent, even jokingly telling me to stop showing off.

The next day it was back to three blind pissing mice."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",How did you move forward? I'm almost 32 but struggling with resentment
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",This is a good point. Teachers should have cared more
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","When I worked at a school, I found out that teachers aren’t allowed to ask parents to get their kids tested for ADHD and learning disabilities. Apparently, doing so puts the school on the hook for paying for the testing because of some kind of legal rules? (Which kind of doesn’t make sense considering that school psychologists are a thing.) Teachers could tell parents more vague things like “your child seems to really struggle with  paying attention,” and then, if the parents brought up ADHD testing themselves, the teacher could discuss and suggest it. But the parents always had to bring it up."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","My 2nd grade teacher was the first/only person (that I know of) that suggested to my mom I should be evaluated. My mom didn't think I had a problem so she never had me seen. I think it was a cultural thing for her that she didn't recognize the signs and thought my teacher just didn't like me.

But having just been dx and medicated 6 months ago at 33, I can't help but wonder still how much easier, more normal, and more productive my life could have been. I'm still considered ""successful"" since I have 2 bachelor degrees, graduated with honors both times, and have a good job, husband, and a kid, but I've struggled every single day of my life. And knowing there was a chance I didn't have to, it's always going to sting a little."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Meh…my teachers knew. Told my folks. They still did nothing.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Heavy on the cringe. The way my adhd exasperates my anxiety and leads me to making dumb choices because of my lack of linear thinking without meds.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Don't blame my parents either. During the late 70s and 80s girls just didn't have ADHD, especially if they did really well in school and could sit in their chair quietly. I have excellent inattentive ADHD (actual  have inattentive and hyperactivity) allowing me to zone out and be wherever I wanted to be. I was smart enough to figure out what I was supposed to do on my own  so there were no scholastic red flags.I was the silly kid with my head in the clouds and forgetting important stuff like their softball mitt, jersey, or cleats for the game. Haha so silly the coach assigned two other players to come to my house to make sure I was packed. I was 18. Nobody thought this might be an issue real soon when I was an adult.

Like you, I grieve for the younger me."

"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I know what you mean - I feel if I had been on meds much earlier, I would have had a completely different life outcome!!"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","32, diagnosed at 29 and this is my take too. I hate how hard life was for me and I remember melt downs not understanding what was wrong so that hurts. On the flip side, I know people who have been medicated since childhood and they have zero coping skills for anytime they’re off meds. In a perfect world that would never happen, but I’m grateful to have learned the “boot strap” way of survival"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","The great news is, studies indicate that even in adulthood, taking the meds may have a neuroprotective or even neuroenhancing effect. Dr. Barkley did a great video on this recently.

"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","No reason to stay angry, you will be the only one to suffer. Make peace with your past by building new memories of joy. Set boundaries for yourself and others and forgive our parents generation as it was not a widely discussed or diagnoses for their generation and timeline. 

We live in a time where information is readily available, changes and gets re-written or updated constantly. Your parents were likely born somewhere around 1940 or so they were born into a timeline that didn’t have todays information. 

Be kind to yourself, and live those next years for joy, love and happiness for you."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Also, my parents still don’t think I have it and I’ve basically been NC with them for over a year now due to their narcissistic tendencies.

"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",Ngl that makes me a bit jealous haha. I went to the doctor when I was 21. I feel I would’ve avoided a lot of trauma and stress had I been diagnosed sooner.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Oh man, the ""totally rearranging the entire workspace cause I have an idea!"" hits way too close to home. The clues were there by like... 10 years old. Didn't get diagnosed til I was 32."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Yep, I know a kid who was unstable and occasionally violent. Now they're lovely, have completed Calculus about 2 years earlier than their classmates, have a maker side business and are headed into engineering. Probably Aeronautical or Nuclear. 

Kids these days, man."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","This is really good to hear. I started medicating my son when he was 9 and it took me a long time to get there. He’s 11 now and I still feel guilty but I’ve always let him know it’s his choice and he typically chooses to take it.

He had a really hard time in school and it has helped a little bit socially but not that much. Next year is middle school so I am hoping a new school and some new people will be a fresh start for him. He takes 10mg adderall one time a day, I feel like that’s a lot but the doctor said he could try 15 mg. His dad (my ex) was forcibly overmedicated as a child so he is pretty against it and has said a lot of things to my son about how he doesn’t need to take medicine to be better or that he is fine the way he is. It has not helped my mom guilt but seeing the improvements in his understanding of things and watching actually understand some of his math homework is pretty amazing. 

It is nice to hear you say you appreciate the medication, I hope my son feels the same way when he is older too."

I used to have mental burnout at least once a year and collapse in on myself. It would end up having to take a few weeks off work to recover, luckily my work understood and supported me. 

Since starting meds a couple of years ago I've not had any time off at all and am about to start a PhD. It's just shocking how different it is."

"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Holy shiz, I WISH my parents or Child psychologist said this for me. They were adamant that the drugs would just make me feel like a zombie, or an addict or miss up my brain.  Even without taking any meds I already feel like all of those now. One of my parents still don't realize my ADHD is still fucking with my life and the other seems only half awake to realizing I got years worth of burnout at the age of 20."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","ngl, this is a heavy resentment I still carry and am working through with my parents.  
They resisted all of it my entire childhood, despite many signs and many people mentioning it about my behavior.  

But we are just echoes of the traumas of our parents, so we never asked for help, never admitted there was a problem we couldn't handle by ourself. It fucked up my parents, it fucked up me and my sibling...  
I am working through it *now*, finally. But It still feels like I should carry resentment for not seeking a solution and avoiding admitting a problem for so long.  
I can *see* how my life would be so different, how many times what I thought was ""normal"" inhibited me."

I AM mad at my mom because I was brushed aside because I was so afraid of being hit by my mother or step father I held all emotions in. I was more emotional and not violent. My sister was violent"

"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","For me, I had to do a lot of therapy to deal with C-PTSD from childhood trauma and neglect.

My 29 year abusive marriage added more trauma. 

I left in 2011, but it took lots of therapy for me to heal.

Once all the crap was out of my life, my ADHD symptoms were so obvious that I had to get asseseed.

How did I move forward? By giving myself permission to get as angry as I want about my circumstances, but I had to get it put in a positive way.

So, I had a lot of angry dance parties in my living room.

When I exercise, I let my anger come out as strength. As long as that angry energy helps me to better myself, I am ok with it.

I still have dance parties in my living room, and I no longer get angry.

I reasoned with myself that to carry resentment that goes nowhere (my parents are dead and my ex is nowhere near me, only prevents me from moving forward.

As a child, my anger turned inward and I developed depression.

Now that I have answers, I am not wasting anymore time.

I don't know if that makes sense to you, but I decided that I have been in the anger phase for too long.

I have my meds and every day, I am grateful that I can function well."

Could’ve saved a lot of time and money and stress, you know?"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","And then the theres me lol . First year on adderall with 15 was great until i started to abuse them from  16-18.

 Also made me way more anxious.  So while i do agree that meds can be helpful it def isnt a life saver for everybody.

What helped me the most was maturing plus psychotherapy and meds IN combination. 

Meds on its own was like having a car but not knowing how to drive."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","You know, I look around at my late-diagnosed friends and almost all of them have a negative internal monologue of ""I'm so lazy, I'm awful, what's wrong with me, why can't I do it,"" AND I DON'T HAVE THAT because I KNEW what was wrong with me. I KNEW why I was impulsive. I KNEW why I was different. I KNEW why I was ""lazy."" It made a HUGE difference in my self-esteem and self-worth and self-image to KNOW. 


Now, my understanding of the disorder was still that as it had been explained to me at age 7, so I needed updating on more advanced concepts (body doubling, time blindness, ""object permanence,"" etc) that would have been helpful tools to know about as I grew into an adult.

"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I’m right there with you. Working through it is taking me a lot longer than I thought it would, but I’m just recently starting to reframe it in a way I can move on from. In my case my mother is the classic example of an undiagnosed, high achiever, with a  good dose of high functioning rage and alcoholism. She’s also funny, smart and caring. She also criticized me to within an inch of my life, on the daily, and still does. She refuses to believe that she may also have the same issues that I do, so I realize that her projected fear & confusion comes out as this nasty constant criticism of me. My parents are also moving quickly towards the end of their lives, and I really want to find peace in my relationship with them. Their complete denial of my reality is still tough, but my time is running out. I’m sorry that you’re dealing with this. It’s been one of my hardest issues to deal with and I know how tough it can be."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Started with Vyvanse. I switched to Adderall because it costs less but it made me feel anxious and I went back to Vyvanse.

The thing that is weird is before I had a script, I probably would have abused it but I am very responsible with it. Because it is in powder form, I take about 1/4 of it at a time. Some days I'll need the whole 40mg and some days I am good with ~10mg. It just depends on what I am doing. My Dr knows this and he is OK with me using it this way."

Dx at 21, settled into the right medication at 23, then immediately completed grd 12 University chem online in 3 months (finished with a 90!!) So i could apply to and start BSc of Agriculture this past January. 

Out of highschool i went to art school, then took a gap year, then medical laboratory tech, worked for a year and a half.

I loved science but never thought I'd be able to do it. In grade 11 i wanted to do biomedical engineering, but everything was so hard (and i nearly failed physics) i decided science wasn't something i could ever do. But now that I'm properly medicated, I'm realizing I'm actually a genius and I'm gonna be a scientist!!! A month ago i had the realization just hit me, like ""holy shit, I'm actually literally gonna be a scientist, it's really happening""

I would've been so much happier and way less disassociated in highschool if I'd had access to medication, i wouldn't have lost 5 years to trying to figure myself out, i could've gone straight into a stem degree and have my bachelor's by now, like all my peers do"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",That's a great analogy! So happy that you now have the peace and direction needed to make your life more stable and fulfilling.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",What meds do you take now? As a engineer by day & musician by night i sometimes feel like adderall IR is a blessing & curse.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",I have that exact inner monologue. It’s almost always negative and nearly word for word of what examples you said lol
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I get it and empathise. 
Please go back to your doc and ask them to find one and book you in. Or seek help from a hospital social worker to sort it. Or hire someone on Fiverr to go with you and then book with you.

Did the psychiatrist  / pharmacy who diagnosed and  supplied the meds not keep records? Would your health fund have such?

"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",I love that he thanked you.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",This made me tear up. Love this for you
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",I'm sorry that your life was shitty as well. I hope that you are in a better place. ❤️
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I’m in Australia. My kid has 19 in his class. Experienced teacher. His last class was 21. Neither teacher picked it up. 

They don’t spot it if it when it doesn’t present as bouncing off the walls. 

I’ve sat in my daughter’s kindy class. Kids are clearly adhd. Teachers don’t see it. They think these kids are naughty. 
Bottom line; they’re not trained to spot conflict seeking. "
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","I agree. Im trying something new next week so im looking forward. Im just sounding very negative because It’s also the truth. 

But ill try focusing on the fact that im doing the work and thats positive"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","Vyanse. 20 mg . The problem is that too much detaches me too much from my core personality and  makes it difficult too access my emotions/ emotionally regulate well. So i  do 20 mg vyanse 3-4 times a week. And 3 offdays so i dont have mood swings/ detach from my core personality/ have mood swings.

The rest is structure and coffee ( not too much so i dont get depeandant and develope a tolerance). Commiting to a routine and habits habit habits. This is so important. If you commit to a routine so many things are easiet even if youre off meds"
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","It makes me weepy thinking about it. It was a long, hard, road to get here. I never thought facing ADHD would be the thing that put us on a better path. It’s what caused huge strife for the last 5 years. I have to admit I found a top notch ADHD specialist who was very good at explaining things and debunking lots of common misinformation without putting him on the defensive."
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?",It’s different in the US. I had bigger class sizes in elementary back in the 90s. Sorry that’s your experience.
"For those diagnosed later in life (> 35), do you wish you had been on medication when you were younger?","How did you realize your core personality & emotions were detached while on medication? This is  interesting concept to consider measuring/monitoring. 

I feel the opposite on medication that i become a better person in every way, but certainly my old lethargic, “willing to always follow others”, more chill childhood comparison exists. I am a much more engaged talkative person when medicated and i certainly feel dependent on it for difficult projects or tasks which maybe i should be concerned about. 

Routine habits are very much a struggle depending on ups downs of social groups / Band progress 🎸 etc"

"Please describe the ritalin ""zombie effect"".","I've been on Ritalin for a month now, and there is no zombie anything going on in my brain. I'm alert, focused, and I don't procrastinate when I'm on it. I can still write poetry. If I do just sit down and relax, my mind is quiet and I just don't feel uncomfortable the whole time.

But everyone is different"
"Please describe the ritalin ""zombie effect"".",Sometimes people who have zombie effect is because they aren’t resting properly and the medicine just pushes them to be able to function but they are exhausted and need rest 
"Please describe the ritalin ""zombie effect"".","Academically good. Emotionally, slightly unpleasant.

Edit: you'll do well in your work, but won't enjoy it lol"
"Please describe the ritalin ""zombie effect"".","The zombie effect isn't unique to Ritalin and it's exactly what it sounds like. Emotionally dead unless *properly* provoked and altogether kind of a dull thoughtless trance. You'll still get things done, but like that other person said it won't be an ""enjoyable"" experience. It's like being on autopilot to some extent. I backed off my dose when it randomly started doing that to me. I started high but think the healthier I became the more effective the meds were, was depressed when I initially started on meds. (don't take this last sentence as fact, it's just conjecture on my part)"
"Please describe the ritalin ""zombie effect"".","I felt this as a kid, maybe 10, and after a few days refused to take any meds for 28 years.  This was a mistake and college and much of the rest of my life would have been better w/ some help.  Maybe I just needed a lower dose or maybe a different medication altogether but I was stubborn and my parents didn't push it too much.  Now I see my 7 year old having much of the same struggles and sometimes It's kind of hard to watch.  We're working on getting her diagnosed."
"Please describe the ritalin ""zombie effect"".","You might get this with Ritalin if you're over-medicated.  I got this when I was taking 54mg Concerta, which was too much for me.  Basically, it was really easy to focus on work, but very difficult to socialize.  If someone came over to talk or ask me something, I would just kind of stare at them.  It was like I was so in the zone that it was difficult to talk.

EDIT: Just to be clear for OP, I think both the methylphenidate and amphetamine based stimulants are great options and I wouldn't want to scare you away from either, but they have their strengths and weaknesses.  If you're in school or having a lot of trouble with a boring, busy-work job, I'd say Ritalin all the way.  The ability to focus on the work for me was just better.  And when I wasn't on too high a dosage, I was able to talk and socialize just fine.

For me, the amphetamine based stimulants (like Adderall or Vyvanse) are sort of the more well-rounded option.  They help in all aspects of my life but I'm not as laser-focused on the work.  But I still get the work done, so it's not an issue.

Also, I just started taking guanfacine (Intuniv) and I gotta say it helps me way more than I thought it would.  It tamps down on my impulses and leg-shaking and also is the best anti-anxiety medication I've ever taken and isn't even indicated for anxiety.  Guanfacine is a non-stimulant, so doctors are less worried about prescribing it.  It's not as effective as the stimulants, but it's something you might look into."
"Please describe the ritalin ""zombie effect"".",I don't have this effect but sometimes when it wears off I feel groggy and unfocused
"Please describe the ritalin ""zombie effect"".","Hi. I take Ritalin at a very low dose ( max 7.5mg in a day atm in divided dosws) and it works great.

When I have taken more than 15mg in a day I feel...very unpleasant.

I obviously can't prove this but I often think ppl are just taking too much for their individual systems. And doctors don't even think that's possible ( that such a low dose might be effective). This ( med sensitivity) is common for the AuADHD ppl I know.

It's such a common thing that I personally think it should be a flag for looking into possible autism in ppl who react weirdly to meds. Just my personal opinion.

But secondarily and just practically, I think it should also just be protocol, especially with anyone who has had adverse or unusual med responses before, to try very low doses and totrate up to the sweet spot. Everyone is different and I think at least some ppl give up on meds because that approach isn't routinely tried.

My tow cents. Which all amounts to- I hope you ah ea flexible minded doctor. They are worth their weight.

Good luck OP🌱"
"Please describe the ritalin ""zombie effect"".","I have used it before, but nowadays using long release.


When dosage too high, I kinda feel... absentminded in a weird way. Like the world is warped around me or something. It's a bit like some shows portray after a flashbang I guess? That feeling of everything being far away.


Right dosage? I still feel like me! Everything just works better."
"Please describe the ritalin ""zombie effect"".","The reading materials I got from my psychiatrist covered what to expect from Vyvanse and how to identify if the dose is high or low and also for ritalin and other medication options, stim and non stim. According to the information provided the zombie effect means the dose is too high."
"Please describe the ritalin ""zombie effect"".","I have been on Ritalin/Concerta since January, no problems."
"Please describe the ritalin ""zombie effect"".","For me it wasn't really feeling like a zombie, but having a straightjacket on mentally. Never used it again after that."
"Please describe the ritalin ""zombie effect"".","Been on Ritalin for 1 year now.  
It works pretty well for me, I'm more focused and I don't procrastinate things. I'm also able to stay calm and organize my activities when I have A LOT of work/chores to do.  
That said, I also take anti-depressant/anxiety and mood stabilizers (but they were doing nothing for my ADHD before adding Ritalin to the mix).  
Sometimes when I take Ritalin in the morning but haven't slept enough I start to feel sleepy a few hours later, even if I don't feel tired because I'm under stimulants. This and the occasional higher heart rate/blood pressure (nothing dangerous at all) are the ""worst"" symptoms I have experienced in this year so far. I don't know if this is the ""zombie effect"" but it happens only if I didn't get enough sleep."
"Please describe the ritalin ""zombie effect"".","I just started ritalin (in combo with strattera), and it is the best prescription drug I have ever taken. Focus up, mood has been feeling better, reasonably more social, all I ever wanted from a medication. 

The biggest side effect, however, is that in super drowsy. It lasts throughout the day, and I'm trying to find a balance with my tea intake. About as close to zombie as it comes. Haven heard of what you're describing otherwise 

That being said, I have tried 5 different adhd prescriptions before this (strattera, guanfacine, adderall xr, Vyvanse, adderall ir, in that order) and ritalin is by far the best I've taken. All the rest had side affects so severe that they outweighed any benefit. Hell, most made my adhd worst. Adderall, for example, made me focused, but on whatevers put in front of me. Got super distracted for hours on end. Worse than no focus at all. And that's aside from severe increase in anxiety and depression, plus losing almost 20 pounds in 2 months (I was weighing 125 as a 5,10 21y/o male. Not good). Needless to say, I was probably far more of a zombie on adderall compared to my ritalin drowsiness. 

Of course, I've heard ritalin and adderall can be reversed in benefit/risk for some people. Ritalin can fucking suck, while adderall is great. No way to know what you are until you try both for yourself (under doctors' guidance, of course)"
"Please describe the ritalin ""zombie effect"".","I have this a little bit when i'm overmedicated. It feels like i'm hyperfocused and can't stop. Any distractions aren't interesting and are ignored. I stop feeling things in a lot of ways and just focus on what's in front of me. It's incredibly calm which feels a bit uncomfortable. And it feels like i'm a robot just doing my work and not really thinking. There's no space to drift away in thoughts to think about anything else or other ways of doing what i'm doing. It's quite clinical like i'm a robot that just does what it's told. To me it feels like my gas pedal is stuck to the floor while being the calmest i've been in my life. 

It's not terible as it's incredibly productive. But it's hard to control. The reality is that i like to have my thoughts drift a bit. I like it when i get a break and think about something else. It's human to need that. When i'm overmedicated however i'm just focused on what i'm doing and nothing else. And i'm not interested in anything else either. Which often results in me getting stuck in a hyperfocus i can't stop. Which kind of stops me being a person and that's very uncomfortable."
"Please describe the ritalin ""zombie effect"".",I took it for a while. The thing about zombies is they actually are VERY focused! They have exactly one thing on their minds. That’s how Ritalin felt to me. I felt sad and dull.
"Please describe the ritalin ""zombie effect"".","Some medications did this to me. I spent a LOT of time in ""zombie mode"". Would not recommend. 

In my case, it dulled all of my emotions to the point of feeling like a trance. Most things just felt ""meh"", and anything that required action would be approached as non-confrontational as possible. Always content to just sit around and not talk to people, perhaps think about the color gray while staring off into space. When people do come up and talk to me, I may genuinely want to converse and make friends, but it takes extreme effort to *appear* genuine. Sometimes it feels like the sociable part of my brain has utterly evaporated, and I could only meet conversations wuth terse, short responses.

It also gave me ""resting bitch face"", as in I was frequently told that I looked very angry or very depressed all the time, when I just felt neutral.

But, I was good in school at least. I was also lucky I had a good group of friends who knew me for who I actually was, so I wouldn't have to worry about being misunderstood. 

Again, wouldn't recommend unless you are desperate for meds."
"Please describe the ritalin ""zombie effect"".","Adderall made me feel like a zombie. Ritalin/concerta doesn't. Its like i'll sit there for hours either doing nothing or barely making progress on what i am working on. Like genuinely loose track of time and then i realize its 2 am and i haven't eaten lunch. That was with too high of a dose. 

Titrating the dose down helped a ton, but concerta doesn't overstimulate me"
"Please describe the ritalin ""zombie effect"".","been on it a couple years. Compared to not on everything is very chill mentally to the point of being a bit boring... I guess that could be zombie ish... 

Nice to be more present to enjoy the moment tbh"
"Please describe the ritalin ""zombie effect"".","My daughter complained about this on her first dose of Ritalin. She's 7.  We talked to the doctor and they suggested a lower dose but longer acting Concerta version.  She's happier so far on that.  

Caveat, we are 3 weeks in on the medication trials.  Her doctor is VERY attuned to side effects and talking directly to my daughter, which we very much appreciate.  If the Concerta continues to be low side effect and my daughter's teachers continue to notice improvements at school, we will be good.  However, if there isn't enough focus or we find other side effects over time, we will try other meds.  

Note: even on the Ritalin dose that made my daughter feel like a zombie and sleep extra, she was far more herself.  She was back into art and creating things like she used to.  There was more art in the two weeks she felt like a zombie than there was in the last year.  It was so amazing to see."
"Please describe the ritalin ""zombie effect"".",I feel like a zombie when I'm out of my medication.
"Please describe the ritalin ""zombie effect"".","Pretty sure there are two reasons:

1. You can finally relax, and you'll thus get tired

2. Your dose is too high and you'll freeze"
"Please describe the ritalin ""zombie effect"".","When my dose was too high plus i was still drinking my full coffee routine, i was an absolute zombie. Max brain fog plus constant headache had me just zoned out on autopilot. 


I cut back on both caffeine and went to a lower dosage and that helped a lot. Someone else mentioned the lack of rest which is kind of my main issue now. "
"Please describe the ritalin ""zombie effect"".",This is a myth from kids taking too high of a dosage so their parents don't have to deal with them being kids. On the right dosage you should see no change in your personality whatsoever.
"Please describe the ritalin ""zombie effect"".","Everyone's going to react a little differently to different medications. I've never had a ""zombie effect"" from any stimulant medication. In fact, it mostly makes me feel a little more upbeat and positive because I feel more in control of my day.

I was actually diagnosed in the '80s and the first medication they put me on was desipramine, which definitely made me feel zombie-like. I'm not sure how common that medication is nowadays, but it definitely was not good for me."
"Please describe the ritalin ""zombie effect"".","I felt like I was just existing and getting through things to survive. On Adderall I feel motivated and proud of what I accomplish, actually happy to live and be productive."
"Please describe the ritalin ""zombie effect"".","On generic Adderall so I can't confirm it's exactly the same but I've had 2 distinct zombie effects.

1. When I first started I wasn't used to the quiet in my brain so I would completely zone out and disconnect if there wasn't a task in front of me. I'd stare out the window and completely ignored that the phone was ringing or that my coworker was even in the room, let alone talking to me. Scariest instance happened when I was driving. I ran a red light and I snapped out of it when someone laid on the horn.

2. More common issue is the crash after. I work 8-12 hours days but if I time my doses right I only get about 7 hours of benefit (if I take my last dose too late I won't sleep). By the time I get home I have no focus, the world and even my thoughts are too loud so I'll sometimes sit in the quiet until it's time for bed"
"Please describe the ritalin ""zombie effect"".",I find when I take it I'm very sleepy and out of it for an hour or so. Then it's ok for the rest of the day. I plan ahead and take it before I need to do anything so it can settle before I have to be responsible or alert.
"Please describe the ritalin ""zombie effect"".","I think people reffering to the mood stabilisation. It really dulls your personality at in my case and im just locked in.

Some people react to ritalin better than others.

My experience was not good but elvanse was great"
"Please describe the ritalin ""zombie effect"".","Many years on 20mg, 2x day.  No zombie here.  Though one of my friends takes it at night so he can sleep."
"Please describe the ritalin ""zombie effect"".",That makes sense to me.
"Please describe the ritalin ""zombie effect"".",Yep. Same for other adhd meds. I only get the “zombie” effect late in the day at work (around 9-10pm). My body/brain was tired hours prior but is just being propped up by the meds.
"Please describe the ritalin ""zombie effect"".",This !!!!
"Please describe the ritalin ""zombie effect"".",All stimulants for me
"Please describe the ritalin ""zombie effect"".","You know what? I had somewhat of the same issue on it. My dose wasn’t even that high, but I recall like trying to ask someone something and just blanking out. The words literally just ran off and disappeared. Or when people tried to ask me something I just struggled to come up with stuff to say. 

Otoh, I never have this issue with any of the amphetamines, ever. It’s way easier to think and talk on them. I am not sure what it is. Like, due to the way the meds work? It’s so interesting to come across someone with a similar issue.

Also, I would like forget to get up and do something else on them. With the amphetamines I can remember to get up, get water, clean something, and just like remember to do other things. Not with Ritalin so much."
"Please describe the ritalin ""zombie effect"".","Thanks for your input.  So, while you are feeling this, in a way robotic and not thinking, yet productive, do you think that you are still able to learn new things, or only execute/practice what you already know? The last is automatic, the first requires active effort and cannot be automatic because learning is actually creating new connections in the brain and saving new information there.

Asking this specific question because I am still studying and not yet at the point where I could just automatically  execute my knowledge."
"Please describe the ritalin ""zombie effect"".","Thanks for sharing! 

The last part I have without any drugs when I have had to perform. E.g, after a stressful meeting, exams etc. My GP thinks I stress myself too much and must rest more. Perhaps it's the same with you: you just have depleted all possible mental resources you had and overworked yourself?"
"Please describe the ritalin ""zombie effect"".","I'd actually be a lot better at studying just not feeling anything about what i learned. So it kind of depends on what you're doing programming for example is not a problem but psyschology and philosophy might be more problematic. It's more that i get so laser focused on any task at hand that i forget to think or feel about anything else (including people, feelings and other things i need to do). I get kind of a tunnelvision.

I still work/learn well and honestly a lot better and productive. I just lose the interest in being human basically. Which also isn't great when the medication starts to wear off and suddenly all of the emotions and thoughts come flouding in. It feels like there's a bariere there that comes down when the medication wear off. 

All of this for me was fixable by just lowering my dose just so you know. Finding the right dose made me be able to focus while still engaging and feeling my feelings.  It's just that this happens when my dose is too high."
"Please describe the ritalin ""zombie effect"".","You're not wrong however I've been in this career for nearly 14 years, I've only been medicated for the last year. The burn out for sure hits me harder after the meds wear off than before I was on them but my overall performance is improved since being on medication. Meds are by far a life improvement.

I kind of think of it like when you're driving a car. You only have so much gas in the tank right? The harder you push down on the peddle the faster you go but the faster you burn through your fuel so you likely won't get as far. It's not a perfect analogy since my brain is the equivalent of a 97 Honda Civic with a million miles on it but i think my point come through?"

Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"This is why you don't tell people unless you trust that they'll understand.  
People have such weird ideas about meds and think our meds are addicting, they're not, unless you find yourself ""addicted"" to functioning in life I guess? lol

It's a shame but it's not worth it to discuss with people, especially if they come from a culture where any sort of mental health issue is stigmatized. They don't want to understand it."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"People will always have their own experiences and perspective, just hold onto your own. Theirs should not matter if you hold your own perspective close. 

As for receiving unwanted lectures, just be blunt. You do not owe anyone to listen to them and just take it. It’s unfair towards yourself. Definitely when the standpoint is one from someone who abused them against someone who takes it and seemingly needs it, those are two different points on the spectrum. 

Just my two cents"
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,honestly who gaf what other people want? do what works for you and your life
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"There’s just a stigma that’s stuck and won’t shift. Whilst amphetamine medication is still around (Adderall) and is in the Central nervous stimulant drug family like methylphenidate they’re wildly different drugs. But stories of adderall addiction just stick around.

SSRI’s don’t get near the same reception and they can be even worse than Adderall. It’s super frustrating. Rest assured most of this community is happy for you that you got your diagnosis and meds are working."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"I am happy for you because I have a loved one successfully medicated.  Years ago when she was in high school, the kid who couldn't settle down and do work for her AP courses was suddenly at a table working right after school saying, ""Remind me how good this feels"" because she was focused and engaged"
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"The absolute worst for me is when it has nothing to do with the “dangers” or effects of the drug, just a belief. I’ve had people tell me that taking medication is wrong because my ADHD is a gift from god. Nothing against religions or anything, just the “mental health/mental illness isn’t a real thing” people, whether it’s a religious or just a personal belief. Or people who just think of ADHD as people with lots of energy who can multitask."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"I was diagnosed early in life but went untreated because of social factors and military service. Barely graduated high school. Going untreated held me back. Eventually I was Honorably Discharged after 8 years of service. Went to work and struggled without a structured environment. Lost jobs, did extremely dangerous things because I lacked impulse control. 
Eventually had a mental episode from some F'd up shit on deployment and personal issues. My doc helped get the ptsd in check, then worked on the rest. I went to college and graduated with honors. I almost cried because I felt worthless my entire life and learned it wasn't true. 

Treatment is exactly that. Nothing more. You will have good and bad days. Take your meds correctly, respect the possible dangers and side effects, learn who you really are. Tell your detractors to pound sand."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,“Until you get your medical license I’m going with what my doctor says.”
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,This reminds me of when a man tried to tell me depression isn’t real and jsut get off the couch. People who haven’t experienced adhd or depression do not understand. They just want to chalk it up to us being “lazy” and shouldn’t need medication to function. I’m glad you got on a med at 21. I’m 34 and just got diagnosed a month ago. I’m on Methyphenidate ER (Concerta) and it has truly made such a difference on my life.
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Judgy people want to feel morally superior. Many meds can be abused, but we're taking them properly. So those people can sod off."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Stop telling people. Sadly part of being ADHD is realizing we talk way too much about ourselves and generally people aren't as interested as we'd like. Also people who are down on meds are stupid and often toxic. It's just not worth trying to convince people to be happy for you.

I on the other hand will congratulate you on finding meds that work for you!!"
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"I’m almost 40 and just diagnosed last year, I share that I’m medicated often to reduce the stigma of it with whoever I share that with… I was not this confident and “no fucks given” at your age though. YOU know your truth, and how much better your life is with it. Feel free to only share with people you feel safe with, it’s your business. It really does help many people and I’m so glad it is helping you!"
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"It's great to hear that you're feeling better with your medication. I experienced a similar situation when I started my first prescription; not everyone understood how it helped me. It’s important to remember that your health journey is personal, and finding what works for you is what truly matters."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Gosh it's nice to hear someone else who feels exactly the way I feel about my functioning and my very strong resistance to the idea of skipping my meds. I know it doesn't answer your question, but it just feels really validating to see someone else expressing the same joy about their diagnosis. I was 36 when I was diagnosed and I had had 35 years to get down on myself because I just couldn't get things done like other people. I am literally better at everything now. Everything. 

People who don't have ADHD don't understand what the meds do on the inside. They can't see us fighting with ourselves to do the thing, or not interrupt, or look away."

“if you find this medication addictive- it’s clearly not made for you, that’s why it’s a controlled substance” 

“yeah, well i live in this body- and i’ll make the choices, thanks”

and my favourite (because people assume i’m actually taking them seriously, it’s so funny and also workplace appropriate)

Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Because they don't get it, people are generally against meds for stupid reasons.  For some people on here Ive read them saying their Meds are life changing and necessary for them.  For me I cant say that as of right now.  It is annoying that people act like the meds are bad to take, when I told one of my friends about meds she said something about ""we can see if you need them"" I didnt like that because the need is very apparent."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"I think one of the reasons, something I experienced myself, is peoples attitude to your medication. There are times I’d forget to take my meds, go into school, see a special needs teacher, after a few minutes I’d get the “have you taken your meds” question. I’d say no. And there was a look of annoyance and dread on their face. I got the same with my family and friends. Like the only way they could manage me and like me was on my medication. Sorta felt like they liked my medication and not me. For a while I became very resistant to taking my meds. In my own time I found a better connection to my meds and now I’m so happy admitting grateful that I have them"

Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"You see when people abuse adhd meds who don’t need them, they can be addicting, and dangerous and bad for you, but if you actually have ADHD, and you take your meds like you are supposed to, oh guess what, it just fixes you and you go on with life like a normal human being…what’s so wrong with being normal? 
It’s like people around us tell us to get help, see someone, talk to someone, get meds; only to turn around and shame us for doing so after the fact."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,People are stupid dont listen to them. There is some strange thing people believe that mental health is something that you shouldn’t need medication for that it’s a moral or personal failing of some kind and they don’t want to see people “addicted to drugs” cause that’s a moral failing to. There is a disconnect in that logic cause the brain is an organ that can have problems just like an eye or a pancreas. The only difference is they don’t lecture people on the dangers of glasses and insulin. It doesn’t make anyone less of a person to take meds for mental health things especially when the meds actually make people function. Don’t listen to them do drugs…. The correctly prescribed drugs that is
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Honestly, I have felt the difference with taking it. That is a discussion between you and your doctor and you have the right to choose. My provider actually told me something interesting, these meds work differently for those with ADHD versus those without, and honestly only you know your lived experience. If someone proves to not be safe I just don’t talk to them about it."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Because people think that people who take it all act like they and bunnies on speed and don't realize that if you actually need it, it doesn't do that to you. It just helps balance the mind for awhile so we can be more productive."

Why are so many people against me taking meds?,People have stupid superstitions about meds.
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,So would they think glasses are addicting to people who actually need them to function? Or insulin to diabetics? Or any other medication for a debilitating condition?
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"There is a lot of misunderstanding about ADHD. They don't see it as a true medical condition. Would they get mad at someone for taking blood pressure medication, or insulin? Of course not. They think if you need medication you must just be lazy, or aren't trying hard enough. 

Personally I wouldn't tell anyone. They don't need to know. Just go on and live your best life."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Honestly I think that because it’s so hard for people without ADHD to understand what it’s like, they feel like we should be able to function like an average person already anyway.

Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"I don't talk to non ADHD'ers about my meds for this exact reason. Besides my family, I don't say which med im on. 

Most humans are walking around regurgitating some scary story they once heard. They haven't read the peer reviewed studies. They haven't looked at brain scans of humans with ADHD with and without medications. They're truly uneducated and spouting off at the mouth. 

I had to learn how to take what some humans say with a grain of salt. They're unaware of the impact of their babbling bullshit. They're unconscious of another humans immediate discomfort. They might be a nice enough human, but they lack the empathy to open their mind to understand how debilitating ADHD truly is. 

I'm guessing someone else said this, but be careful who you tell you have meds, scum bags will steal them, and some will hound you for them.  

And my unsolicited advice, add therapy into your regimine. 

For me, at first, being diagnosed and medicated seemed like a cure. But once I educated myself on ADHD more, I realized I would never be cured of it. And since my brain was functioning for the first time, I inevitably burned myself out. So I had a rambling cry fest in my drs office. He suggested a specific therapist and a med increase. Long story short, going undiagnosed for so long leads to lots of good coping mechanisms but also unhealthy coping mechanisms, and I'm working through those in therapy.

Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"They're either projecting their own issues with the meds on you, or it's a feeling a fear that you're getting a leg up over them by using a ""limitless"" style drug.

Projection!!!

People have huge misconceptions about the health risk of stimulant medication, and almost no knowledge of the health risks of untreated ADHD. 

It would not be an approved treatment if those factors didn't balance substantially in favor of their being less risk generally in medicating vs. not.

I like screwing with people. I tell them I take amphetamines everyday. They won't believe me for a few weeks. 

When they do believe it if they get real concerned I ask them what they know about it. If they get condescending ask if they learned that from a psychiatrist or from some random on a podcast or talk show.

My favorite is when they say it's meth, meaning meth-amphatamine. That is a rare prescription. Adderall is amphetamine.  
I say ""no way show me.""   
They either know a little about chemistry or they think they've got me when they find something saying it's amphetamine.  
""here see""

""lets say it is super addicting and I get addicted to it. For somebody with ADHD it's still shown to increase my quality of life, improve my relationships, improve my work performance, and reduce all cause mortality when taken most everyday.

Yes I know that the drug we use is addictive to people who don't have ADHD, but that's because their brains are different! They don't need that extra chemical in their brain, we're just trying to get back up to baseline for crying out loud. 

I've just recently been diagnosed about a year ago actually and I've just recently started medication.
It cracks me up that this crazy stimulant makes me want to go to sleep. It's nice though because most the time I can't sleep. 😅

I read that you are in Germany and I am in the US where it is a lot more accepted but still there are people who argue that meds are bad and unnecessary. I simply tell them that I have been on them for 16 years and they are a very necessary part of my life. They are the reason I have been able to accomplish all that I have.

Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Essentially people just know it from the abuse of it. I’m an elder millennial and abusing ADHD meds happened quite a bit in the aughts in late HS and early Uni years. They were even used as storylines of popular TV shows back then (Felicity Huffman’s character in “Desperate Housewives” comes to mind.) My formal diagnosis came at age 40 and I started meds, but even I found myself having to fight my own presumptions about it because of the media and stories from youth of actual ppl abusing it.

Funny enough, if I had ever taken it illegally I probably would have figured out I do have ADHD sooner when it did none of the symptoms non-ADHD describe when they take it.

Don’t worry about others. When you have ADHD the med does the function the way it’s meant to, other people don’t understand (esp ones who have abused it) because their perspective of it is seen through a narrow lens. They just don’t understand (and choosing to not understand because they aren’t just simply asking you) what the med does for someone with actual ADHD."

Stop sharing this with others and don’t tell anyone else! I’m glad that you found something that works for you but it’s not anyone else’s business. If anyone asks you about it, I’d just say that you’re working with your doctor to find what’s best for you and don’t have anymore."

My sister doesn't take any stimulants because of an addiction history and her choice to not tempt herself. We each do what works for us. ADHD is something the medical field is only just starting to get a better hang on in the past couple of decades and that understanding still has a long way to go. It will be much longer for it to enter the general social consciousness. Invisible disabilities like ours are hard for people to understand"
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Honestly, ignorance and uniformed judgement. Maybe a bit of jealousy? Probably some pseudoscientific wackiness here and there.

It’s noise you can tune out. You don’t need to tell anyone you don’t want to, and you don’t need to take anyone’s ignorant reactions seriously."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"I was off meds for about 6 months, everything fell apart because I didn’t have the systems in place for it to be sustainable. Oh and I gained 40 lbs. 

I just started back on meds and I thought it would be better but it’s so much worse. 
My dose is too high but my doc said to hang in there and the anxiety and depression would start to become more manageable… // I called today and started crying explaining the torture. // I feel like my chest is tight/ I can’t breathe. I have tingling and numbness in my hands and feet, I feel like my heart is pounding out of my chest, I’m angry and irritable and anxious. I feel constantly like I’ve done something wrong. Anxiety and overthinking are my constant companions. I have a stress rash on my chest and temples. I can’t remember to drink water or eat because everything else around me that’s been neglected for far too long is more pressing. 

Meds are a double edged sword. You’re damned if you do and damned if you don’t. Choose your poison. 

It’s really the world that’s fucked.  But hey- we live here."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,Also- had to call 4 pharmacies to find one that had the medication I was prescribed in the US. The shortage is brutal.
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"i just don't tell people what the medication is for. ""hey i need to take my medication real quick, be right back"" ""oh what for? diabetes?"" ""no, just something to manage my conditions that otherwise impact my daily life"". when i say it's for ADHD they start trying to guess what i take so i dont even mention it's for ADHD anymore lol

it's so frustrating that the stigma around these meds... came from people who didnt need it the way we do, irresponsibly abusing it. like yeah it's gonna do weird things to you if you dont have ADHD??? like whats next, you gonna tell a cancer patient they should quit chemo because of what it does to a body without cancer? 😭

my favorite was when id mention i take it.. and the other person would be like ""OMG 😳😳 i used to buy some of those from my friend in college, i took them at a party and the next day i finished my exam in 20 minutes and still passed"" yeah bro.... totally why i take it... not like it just makes me a normal person or anything... lol. but way funnier response than the usual ""whatttt why they make you take that you will become meth addict 😢😢😢"""
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Just tell them fuck off.  I am happier than i have ever bern, my life i am finally getting my life  in order and you want me to stop the one thing that helps.  Fuck off!

Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Social media bombards people with disinformation. People believe ADHD treatment is prescription meth, and the doctors are making money off of a junkie's addiction. Plus the job culture of America is getting so bad. People are expected to work more than ever to make up for short staffing and you are expected to 'just wokr harder.' They see ADHD as a made up excuse.

I got ADHD but I can't even get treatment because I don't make enough money to afford it. Those that know they can't afford it just don't bother looking into it."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,My family used to tell me I didn’t need meds. I told them flat out if I wasn’t on meds I’d be dead by now. That shut them up pretty quick.

""Oh, drugs make you high and then you get addicted"" - bro, most of us are on a super low therapeutic dose that wouldn't make you high to begin with!"
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,Im very defensive of the usage of psychopharmaceuticals. I really wish I'd started them sooner. Maybe then I would have actually studied in college and figured out a career path. The people who try to scare you from them are usually people who don't have your kind of mental struggles and don't understand what the medication is doing to you.
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,Tried to explain nicely but apparently anything but a full-throated endorsement of meds isn’t allowed. I’m toxically positive. I’ll see myself out. Please don’t any of the pro-Pharma tweakers try to follow me.

Congrats dude! while meds ain't for everybody, they’re great for so many people.

Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"I think there is something in human nature, about not liking change.

There is this weird power dynamic among people, ofc not all are like that, but most get a bit jelaous that you are actually turning your life around in a big way. Ofc, there is a stigma too..."

Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"I hear that, I really don't talk to many people about it, unless they ask.  I get the typical 'i wouldn't want to have to take drugs everyday' from people who take lipitor every day because they can't stop eating like shit..."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"As other people have said, don't tell people. 

I personally hate meds. Having to deal with the healthcare system just makes life so much more complicated, and I didn't like any of the meds I tried

Only you know what's best for you and you have to figure that out on your own. It is kind of lonely, and certainly frustrating. But that's life for people with chronic illness"
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"I'm glad it's working for you. 

I was on Ritalin and adderall. I don't really like the way it made me feel. It's great in that it allows me to focus for extended periods of time, but the crash was brutal. I was just expecting to be tired, instead I felt depressed and worthless and like crying all the time. 

Doctors I've worked with basically have a stimulants or we can't help you approach. 

Tbh, I haven't really figured out what meds do or don't work for me. I'm a bit scared of them now though as I've struggled with depression my whole life too.
Opened to suggestions if anyone else has had similar experiences."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"The stigma around ADHD medication just being ‘speed’ or ‘meth’ probably. 
If somebody asks me I’ll do my best to explain it to them but you can tell they never really get it. 
‘What does it do for you and why do you actually take it’ is such a broad question to begin with so whatever. Otherwise I just don’t really bring it up in conversation, it’s my business if I need a couple of pills a day to act like a normal functioning adult not theirs after all. 

Just remember you  don’t owe anybody an explanation for anything, it’s your health and wellbeing and unless they’re your doctor they can fuck off"
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,People don't really know what they're talking about. Literal doctors are still trying to accept that it's more than a bad kid phase.

Meanwhile, take your damn meds and live your best life. 👌"
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Those type of people probably heard how it's like "" speed"" or "" meth"" and is addictive for those who abuse the drug on its own. 

I've been on 2 types of adhd meds myself and never felt addictive to it. 

If people ever try to say. Explain the science be hind it if you wanna fight it. Or even say ""oh damn you know this as a fact? Cause my experience is a positive one. Me and my doctor are seeing great results with no negative symptoms."""
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"because so many people are ignorant on the chemical makeup of the drugs, and dispelling that misinfo isnt really a priority. statistically your coworker the next cubicle over hears alarm bells when they hear about legal stimulant drugs. they'll see an infographic of the chemical structure of meth**amphetamine** and meth**ylphenidate** being only slightly visually different and freak out.

No. Probably not."

Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"To people who do not have adhd, the medications are all that; stimulants,  addictive, bad etc. Awesome thing is, they are also highly effective at managing symptomatic adhd. Find a few supportive friends and keep life simple. Don't disclose it to everyone to share their ill-informed and unqualified opinion. Presumably you are under a specialist and have a prescription. You don't owe others any explanation. I am sorry this has been your experience."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Bias based on bs values. Don’t tell people. It’s none of their business. 

If people say they think you shouldn’t be taking them, ask them where they got their medical degree."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"yeah, ... stop telling people your business unless they absolutely must know for your sake and safety, i.e. GP, or some other doc. Family and friends dont need to know unless you need their help and theres no way to avoid. If they ask you why you didnt tell them, just tell them about the prescription hemmorhoid cream you got and how it is used in full detail, and remind them that they dont need to know everything about your medical stuff,  just whats important. And if they offer opinions, politely decline and tell them you have your own and those are working just fine for you. 

Honestly, let your success speak for you. the same as with weight loss, everyobe is jealous, and will smile at your goals, but tear down your methods. You are doing this for you. You dpnt need tbeir permission or approval. Loving yourself enough to know whats good for you. You dont need their negativity, so dont go fishing for their approval cuz its 50/50 whether they'll bite or you end up with a soggy boot of disappointment."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Everyone has opinions on meds, mostly bad opinions. Dont listen to them. It’s not their body."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,I’ve taken to bringing up the chemical imbalance that adhd is and how stimulants have been proven to improve symptoms. I’m surprised by how few people understand or really internalize that. You wouldn’t give somebody with type 1 diabetes a hard time for taking insulin. But maybe brain chemistry just feels like magic or something.
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,The people who judge you because of taking meds to help treat your adhd symptoms are people you need to tell to GET f$&?!@“.
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"I am 21 too and the same meds as well (concerta a.k.a Methylphenidate XR). In my country people don't even associate it with methamphetamine and yet they always have some negative stigma around it. 

According to them just doing some meditation would fix everything lol. That's why I don't tell them jack shit. You cannot expect someone to understand something that they cannot possibly experience or see the actual effects of. They're sympathetic to pain killers cause they can see how much a dude with a broken foot must be suffering.

However, they can't even imagine how much someone with a broken brain suffers even if you give them a vibrant description cause all they can relate it to,  is their own laziness."

Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"13 years of moderate anxiety and severe depression i went through all the steps without medication mainly antidepressants which the doctors were trying to push me to take but I'd seen to many people with limited or no success. I finally get my diagnosis and accept medication after years of self medication with various substances and a science degree background I was fairly clued up on the mechanisms of the medication they offered me and do understand the negative physical effects they can have, but my inner peace take priority over that now I know how well it works. And the whole medication thing comes with a stigma anyway the way I look at it is I function fine without it but not in a society that's been created by those who stigmatise medication. people who are inherently different are medicated to cope or to become what society wants them to behave like. (Of course, this applies mainly to disorders where the person still has autonomy or is high functioning. I'm not undermining the need for treatment and I'm happy I have it)"
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"America in particular has a very unhealthy attitude toward mental health and taking prescription medication. But *especially* taking prescription medication for mental health reasons. We basically still have this pervasive belief that we can just ""bootstraps"" our mental health, and that somehow our brains are entirely divorced from the rest of our biology. 

These people do not understand that our brains are run by hormones and chemicals and tiny electrical zaps that convey information and it's a very delicate system where even the tiniest imbalance of any of those things means your brain behaves in a way that makes life harder for some of us because the rest of the world doesn't work the same way.

It's also honestly super weird considering how many commercials we're subjected to constantly are the drug manufacturers pushing shit at us we didn't even know we needed to be worried about...you'd think Americans would be more receptive to people using prescription meds, considering."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"I’ve been taking medication for seven years, but I recently stopped, and it has brought on the worst time of my life. I feel lost, disconnected from my emotions, and like I don’t know who I am anymore. I’m constantly experiencing panic attacks and other overwhelming feelings. It’s as though I’m feeling everything I’ve avoided all at once, and it’s destroying me to the point where I feel like I need to go back on the medication.

For me, medication just numbs emotions—blocks them. But when you try to live without it, everything comes crashing back. in my case, it turns me into something robotic—happy for a short time, until I need to take more and more."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"I am somewhat in the same boat. My wife has a negative attitude towards medication “you don’t want to be relying on meds”. She also says “you can’t use adhd as an excuse” and flipped out at me if I did something (or do not do something) due to my adhd. Adhd sucks, you can never win."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Every person that im *required* to tell for work and licencing inevitably tells me they ALSO have some kind of issue and you just need to focus. Or that I shouldn't want to be on medication my whole life. Or some other fucking platitude.

I just tell them I'm telling them because I'm required to by law. I'm gonna get medical advise from my psychologist and psychoanalyst."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"A lot of people are like that with meds in general. So many people have the goal to be on as few meds as possible instead of having the goal to be as healthy as possible or to feel as good as possible. It seems to be especially true with medications that people think are over-prescribed (antidepressants, stimulants, anxiolytics, pain meds, weight loss drugs, etc). Just remember that everyone has autonomy to make the best decisions for themselves about their body and medical treatment. If someone would rather feel worse and be on fewer meds, they can do so. If you'd rather feel better and take meds, you can do so. When people try to give me advice like that, I say something like: I'm sorry, I wasnt asking for advice. I'm really satisfied with the treatment plan my doctor and I developed for my particular situation. But thanks for sharing your experience! I'm glad you found a solution you're satisfied with, too""."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,Just ignore them. I had the “health nuts” tell me how bad they were and that they’ll shorten my lifespan. I think being 90 pounds overweight and not taking care of myself was way more detrimental to my health than being on medication. Don’t let those people get to you and just be happy for you and proud of yourself for going through the process and improving your life.

Why are so many people against me taking meds?,Stop telling people 🤷🏼‍♀️ They aren’t entitled to that information just because the know you. Who cares what they think? This is your life and you only get this ONE life. Do what you need to do and tell them their opinions aren’t welcome.
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,Tell people there's a difference between abusing drugs you got on the street and taking your medication which was prescribed by a doctor tbh.
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"I personally think it might be addictive if you don't have a medical reason to be taking stimulants. But for people with ADHD, I don't think it is addictive at all. 

I don't know why people are so bothered by people taking meds for a diagnosiable disorder that has nothing to do with them. These are probably the same people that get annoyed when unmedicated kids act out and say things like why can't they just behave.

I still advocate for medications for people but some days I find it so frustrating dealing with it myself. While I do so much better on medication, the hoops we have to jump through to get the medication makes me wonder if it is worth it somedays. Like I am already harassed by my doctor, do I really need some random stranger giving me a lecture on adhd meds too?"

Why are so many people against me taking meds?,I was diagnosed ADHD but didn't get medicated till years later. But I would tell people that had ADHD and that's why I'm so fidgety. Once I stated that I noticed people not being as inclusive & made me sort of an outcast. Once I got medicated I decided not to say anything about my ADHD due to the stigma as well as people asking for my meds. It's sad that you gotta be an outcast and I understand how you feel.

Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"I have adhd too, and I agree meds help times a million. Unfortunately I also have substance abuse problems, and I used to double or triple my dose for the day because it made everything I did feel so awesome, but after a few months of that I realized how it wasn’t worth it because I would be non functional for the two weeks that I had run out of meds. Now I take one a day and seriously it helps a lot, burnout no longer exists, and I’m able to complete tasks with less effort! A lot of people who are against meds are either worried you would abuse them, or they are jealous that you seem to have found the answer to all your problems. The best thing you can do is either ignore them, or reassure them that you take them as prescribed, and they help you feel like a normal person should."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"As others have mentioned if it’s not pertinent to the conversation I would keep that to yourself, depending on what medication you take people are going to assume that you’re doing it for the drugs it’s not real yada yada yada blah blah blah blah blah, it’s no different from riding a motorcycle everybody knows somebody’s second cousin‘s third wife knew somebody who died in a motorcycle accident, whatever I guess the point is share what you want , people are gonna have unsolicited opinions about things they don’t understand so that they don’t appear stupid. They literally just parrot back what they hear on social media and the news without any original thought behind it."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Hey I'm 21 too , taking the same thing, and I'm so proud of you. You saw a problem and by yourself took the steps to increase your quality of life. That's all adulthood is. When I was younger I was all about being open minded and listening to different opnions but now that my frontal cortex is more developed I'm way more discriminating. Its not bad or ignorant or stupid or unkind or disrespectful to immediately disregard what someone said. People do it alllll the time."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"I personally find 2-3 major reasons for this attitude toward psychiatric medications. 

1. General ignorance and believing that any drug use is bad, usually based on an abuser they know or stories they’ve heard.

2. Personal experiences. In my case, my father has ADHD and was prescribed Ritalin when he was 7. My grandmother said it made him a zombie. While I don’t disagree with that, my father is severely in need of some medication and I watched him struggle my whole life. Now that I’m diagnosed, it’s even more apparent. I’m sure lots of people try one drug, have some negative side effects and choose to write off all drugs.

3. Pure human jealousy. It’s nicer to believe that people close to us would only wish the best for us but sometimes it’s not the case. Some people might notice you doing better in life, maybe better than them, and they try to discourage the very thing helping you.

Edit: spelling"
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Do what you want, its your life of course.

I hate it a lot, we have many flavour of human but only mediocre grey is allowed space it seems as its the easiest to control. 


This will either change to give different minds more space or get worse if we can, for example, destroy any unwanted neurological differences before birth. I rather do drugs for fun and self exploration tbh, not to fit in a system shaped around viewing you as a statistic. But if no different paths that suit you better are in sight i am very understanding of wanting to make it easier to fit in, for your own good in a unfortunate way.

You’re literally disclosing confidential information to people who have no education or knowledge in your diagnosis. No one is expected to understand how a mental/neurological/physical condition affects us because it’s not their experience. 

You don’t need to “prove” to others how stimulants improved your life. Or even that stimulants are good for people with ADHD. Don’t expect people to agree with you on this subject as it’s highly misunderstood and still vastly stigmatized. 

Just enjoy your improvements in your own. It’s about seeing the amazing changes your medication has done for you, and that’s a tremendous celebration on your own. I’m happy that your medication is working because stimulants are a true blessing for us ADHD folks!"

Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Yeah unfortunately this is something I’ve generally learned as well. There are some people close to me who I trust and I’ll share that info with them, but otherwise I find it’s just better not to tell anybody. I’m slightly more open to sharing that I have ADHD, but even then it depends a lot on the person.

Especially in the workplace - I have been very reluctant to tell anybody at work that I have ADHD or take meds for it. It’s a bit of a double-edged sword; I think if I had a manager I really trusted then that info could help how they think about delegating work to me, but I’m generally pretty skeptical overall about sharing any sort of medical info that could be stigmatized with an employer unless I have to."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Yeah most people are either going to judge you or try to bum adderall off you, in my experience."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"This. Just don't tell them. I got diagnosed and started medication as soon as possible. Took 1 year to get the right med and dose. I didn't lose a word about any of it. But I got things done, gained confidence, and started taking very little chatter to heart. Don't tell anyone. Take the meds, live your life. Perhaps, once you have someone you really love, she/he can know your secret. That's it."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,The most positive feedback I got was - ok once you have it under control you can stop else you might get hooked.
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Yeah, i guess i have to learn that the hard way. Even my closest friend is disapproving (or at least not happy) with me taking my meds, because she had a hard time getting off of Stratera antidepressants. Idk what mental gymnastics contest is going on in my social circle. and thank you for the kind words!"
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,^ This. Not everything is for everyone to know.
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,Agreed. I find it odd that people volunteer this information to others. No one needs to know about your personal health. I’ve told literally one person and the only other person I still feel the need to tell is my other parent. I would never want to share it with anyone else.
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,Sage advice. Applies to a lot of things
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Yeah I agree with this. Stop telling people, they’ll only criticize you for it. 

I can come across as socially awkward at times, and I believe that doing so exposes a vulnerability that people take advantage of. This gives them the justification or reasoning to tell me how to live my life and yours. 

I encourage you to respect yourself enough to not subject yourself to that kind of treatment. I send this with love man."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,GOOD ADVICE!
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Yeah, and then they'll just hit me with some ""but...but.... long term effects!!"" bs."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Yup and Ritalin also won't show up on most drug test because of this but Adderall might. Because they check for part of the composition of Adderall which isn't shared with Ritalin.

Ritalin iirc is the same ingredients in concerta though."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Okay didn't know that! Thanks for letting me know. Adderall isn't legal in the EU and so i never had any contact with it, just picked up what i heard online. Edited the Post!"
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Germany. I think the stigma comes partially from the meds used on younger kids. I remember growing up, my mom was talking badly about a boy in our neighborhood for getting ritalin. She described it as if a lively happy active boy turned into a zombie."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"I come from a culture where mental health is really stigmatized and even though I live in the US, the people around me still hold on to prejudices and stigma so getting factual and truthful information is difficult for me because I don’t know what is right or wrong."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"I just repeat to people that I feel much better on my meds and my doctor says they are like glasses; I will need them my whole life (although he did note that as I got into my 60s-70s and beyond I might need less). My doctor has been practicing medicine for 50 years. He retired from being pediatrician and became a specialist in adult ADHD after he saw a need. Pretty sure he knows more about this than someone who abused an ADHD drug as a teenager. I simply repeat myself when people try to convince me. Never underestimate the power of simply saying ""That has not been my experience"" blandly."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"i think i just need to hear someone approving of me doing better. I fought so hard for the diagnosis and i can't share my joy with the people around me, kind of bums me out."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,I take Adderall and although I only talk about it with people I would discuss my private medical information. If I heard someone speaking negatively about mental health medications I doubt I would be able to refrain from letting them know how misinformed they were.
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Ugh, that's the worst because the majority of the time, they don't have that themselves. Again, this is when you fight crazy with crazy. Hit em with ""yeah, that's what my buddy with tuberculosis said, he wasn't a people person and randomly coughing blood was a really effective way to communicate that he was an introvert.. I miss him sometimes"""
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"ADHD is only a gift if you live in the forest and need to be able to be aware of everything going on at once and also mentally tracking miniscule changes to local environment that could indicate danger. 

Yes Karen, it's a gift from gawd that I can smell the rain before it arrives as if I couldn't tell by looking at the damn sky. It's a gift from gawd that I can watch my house get progressively dirtier, but I can't bring myself to clean until it reaches a breaking point. My magical ADHD powers won't stop me from wanting to sleep for 18 hours a day to avoid the sensory overload that comes with raw-dogging modern life...but you know what Karen? I've found that with drugs, all things are possible. I can clean my house. Before it gets overwhelming. I can stay awake longer. I can do tasks, and it's not the end of the world."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"I wish I could like this more times!! I had to tell my MIL this sooo many times with my son, even though both of her sons have been diagnosed with it, myself, and several other family members. She even told me BIL that they needed to have his step daughter tested and put on meds after giving us so much crap. 😑"

Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"you get it! I don't want being forced into silence. I want to be able to share things i feel are fine to share. Thanks for the kind words, i hope things are going wonderful for you as well!"
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Yeah idk I don't think I specifically said I was medicated, but I definitely gave a presentation (in front of lots of senior leadership) at my corporate job as part of an internal development thing and said I had ADHD. 

I definitely made it relevant to what I was presenting on (resources to guide and organize the new hire experience) but I haven't had anyone hold it against me. And I don't think me mentioning I had ADHD in this presentation, was any stranger than another guy mentioning his daughter had downs syndrome in order to talk about encouraging volunteerism in his presentation. 

🤷🏻‍♀️ Tbh my talking about creative thinking + working harder to be organized and create systems to work with as a result of my adhd probably helped me get the next immediate promotion at work. Mostly because my boss wanted someone who could be creative, think outside the box, would deep dive (hyperfocus) on things, etc lol. Being like ""I'm not naturally organized, I had to *make* systems to be organized in, I work harder at it."" helped too. 

I don't share in job interviews, but I also don't care if people where I work know or see me taking a pill out of a pill bottle."

Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"No. It’s because they genuinely care. I had this same thought process before I quit meds. Was on for 12 years and it didn’t fix a god damn thing once I was off because I didn’t do the work to help any part of me. I feel passionately about this topic because I am now the best I’ve ever been because I learned to love myself and make changes to my life to help w my adhd. In order to live a fulfilling life w out constantly putting myself down for my adhd. That life sucks. Or say you run out of meds and you have to make excuse after excuse, to your employer, your partner, whoever. No. Stop making excuses and start working on your shit to self acceptance and love. Surround yourself w people who know how you are and accept you. Create a career for yourself where you can excel. Because trust me, there’s one out there for you. Hyperfocus is a gift. "
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"While I agree with you, there’s irony in the fact that getting an ADHD person to remain consistent with such a regime… would more often than not, benefit from the aid of medication to successfully achieve those consistent tasks.

It’s a damned if you do, damned if you don’t situation *for some*.  I understand that discipline comes into play… However, being punctual and consistent with routines can be quite the obstacle when everything is a distraction."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"My God! Thank you for saying your stimulant helps your depression. 🙌 I swear my med management nurse acted like I was the only one who ever said that my stimulant helps my depression. I felt so alone, and maybe she was thinking I was becoming a “user”. I basically said, “Lady, I just want to feel like a normal, semi-productive human being everyday. If it helps my depression, too, all the better.” I take my meds exactly as prescribed. But when I miss it for more than 24 hours (forget to go to the pharmacy to pick it up), I sink into a deep hole that feels endless."

Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Oh believe me, they very much do lecture people about pain meds after surgery, if they can even get them anymore. As someone with both ADHD-PI, as well as severe chronic pain, I see people starting to face the same awful stigmas now with stimulants that people who need opioids, for any reason, have faced. The DEA is starting to come for stimulants now just like they did opioids, and it's so f*cked up that they're even allowed to do it."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"My friends have heard me sob multiple times about how much i hated my ADD symptoms and saw how hard it was for me to get my diagnosis and meds, and now they expect me to return to that.

Why are so many people against me taking meds?,When it's extremely hard to get our meds anyway 🙄 we can't just give them away unless we accumulated an emergency stash (like I had covid late last June and I couldn't take my adderall so I piled up some) and I only gave one to my dad who doesn't get immediately addicted to them if he takes one or two due to self-restraint..just needs them to focus on driving long distances like driving in Los Angeles when he helped move my youngest sister back home to Phoenix. I wouldn't give them to my bf since he has an addictive personality and I'm afraid of him stealing my meds. He has yet to set up with his own primary doctor though so he would have to get his own script.

Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"I think that may be true for some children. 

I read that since kids’ brains are malleable, and ADHD is a “wiring problem”, a child can take meds and go to therapy, over time, their brains will “rewire” themselves, and they will be “cured”. But for adults, our brains are done changing significantly, so we must remain on meds and constantly practice the exercises and coping mechanisms. "

Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Agreed. Learn good habits and rewire your brain for a few years, taper down to smallest dose if possible.  I stopped taking from ages 28-32.

Why are so many people against me taking meds?,[removed]
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Adderall is dextroamptamine-amphetamine and Ritalin is methylphenidate HCL. Both in the class of central nervous system stimulants, just different receptors in the brain for each. Ritalin is faster acting with a shorter half-life, but similar in effect to Adderall enough to understand your equating. Very different drugs, however. Congrats on functionality, though. It's certainly a miraculous feeling."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"I'm from 🇪🇺 (Belgium) 

Adderall, or rather dexamphetamine, isn't illegal. At least in Belgium. There are no commercial meds available, but the pharmacist can always prepare  it ""off label"" for you.

It is second choice though compared to Ritalin (methylphenidate).

Ritalin is (almost) free though, while off label preparations can cost waaay more"
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,That’s sad Adderall is a life changer miracle drug. Not everyone gets the same results but it’s insane how few side effects it gives for how much I get. Usually with anxiety and antidepressants if it works well it  comes with debilitating side effects and if it has almost no side effects the meds don’t change anything. Aderal fixes my ADHD and my binge eating issues with the only drawback being I forget to drink  water.
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"OP, for context, concerns about children becoming zombies tell me that the cocktail is wrong.

If you need another way to tell people to fuck off when they begin bringing up said children, tell them to think of it like caffeine- One cup of coffee creates one experience, while chugging a quad shot produces a very different experience. It’s about trial and error and the balance, and the people who it is up to are the patient and the physician- No one else.

Be cautious about people who describe children medicated with Ritalin as zombies. If it calms them down, then it’s probably working as intended. If it excites them too much, it’s not working, and that is a conversation for the patient and the provider. 

Those close to the child who dislike the stability these resources provide likely do not actually have the child’s best interest in mind.

Consider what kind of person knows that their child is struggling with a developmental disorder and take offense to that child being treated effectively and experiencing a better life.

I hope this helps, and enjoy telling everyone else to fuck off. Go be awesome.

*Edited for typo"
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Hi low land neighbour here. Lots of kids used to get too high of a dose back in the day. The old protocol was to start a high dose and than adjust to lower dose. And that came with many negative side effect and experiences from the onces taking it and their social cirlce. Now the recommend protocol is starting from a lose dose and build up to find the perferred dose. Unfortunately there are still some psychiatrist that still use the old protocol on kids. 

Also one part is simply lack of knowledge. A simple conversation takes away a lot of that stigma"
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,">it'd be better if i stop and rawdog life again or something

Work=moral goodness.  You live in a protestant, calvinist capitalist society, its bad in Germany and downright horrific in parts of the USA (because you guys kicked the radicals out and sent them here), but a lot of resistance to psychiatric medicine boils down to calvinism formulating morality as (and this is an extreme summary): if you're good, you work hard and waste no time on earth, and if you're bad or lazy or morally deficient, you reach for worldly crutches which are tools of the devil."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Yeah that is a common complaint because back in the day most doctors were severely over prescribing the amount of ritalin to give kids. Based on today's dosages all the ""zombie kids"" were way above what is given out now.

I've read anecdotes about how this is related to the fact that a lot of people wanted kids to fit the narration of ""seen and not heard"", and while I would agree with that I doubt you'll find much documentation on that portion of it."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Many years ago, when ADHD was first being recognized as a thing, there weren't a lot of options available for medication, and the medical community wasn't very sophisticated in how to use them. There are a lot of horror stories of kids being turned into zombies, or getting dangerously underweight, back in the day. 

Today, there are many more options, and doctors know more about how to use them effectively, and if you were turning into a zombie you'd be the first to be aware of it. 

The truth is that every prescription medication has downsides and risks; that's why they require a prescription. The prescription is a statement from a medical expert saying that the benefit to you from this medication is greater than the risk, based on YOUR specific medical condition and history. Whatever someone may have heard about someone else is irrelevant to whether this med is good for you. They have no useful information to contribute that you and your doctor don't already know."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"We got your back bro. Meds were literally life changing for me.

Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Absolutely agree, the average person has no idea just how life changing that medication can be to someone and many more don’t understand what ADHD is, what it can do to people and why stimulant medication is often the preferred, best and safest route. Sadly they hear stories in the news and that’s all that sticks… sure drugs like Adderall can be addictive but sometimes even controlled, prescription drugs get misused and or don’t agree with people. I think it all comes down to some people just don’t actively try to better themselves through gaining knowledge or understanding of things they know nothing about but just take what they hear as gospel.

I mentioned the SSRI comparison because they’re weirdly more socially acceptable yet having had a comedown from SSRI medication in the past, I can say that getting hooked on them is a far greater risk, the dependency stems from what not having them does to you not what having them does if that makes sense. It’s not something I ever wish to experience ever again in my lifetime but I still see that people need them and I’d be happy for anyone I knew if it helped them!"
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Are you in the states? Some psychiatrists will just ask you some questions and have you fill out a form and they’ll start prescribing you meds. For an official diagnosis, you need to get psychiatrically evaluated, which can be done with doctors that specifically only do evals or you can try a psych dept of your local university. There can be a long wait for this process, and it can be expensive. It’s stupid, for sure."

Why are so many people against me taking meds?,I 100% get it. But an unhelpfully large percentage of your friends and loved ones are still going to tell you this type of shit. I'm very happy for you by the way it's an amazing feeling to know that there is a way to fix things.
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Exactly, it's the same as any other medication. Just because your life is better with the medication which drives you to continue to take it doesn't mean you're addicted. But some people do"
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Sharing is caring, just share with the ones who care !"
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,Thanks for the validation- that’s really kind of you to say. Once I have insurance I think I will definitely check out some alternative options for docs if I don’t get it figured out by then. I think they might try me on a different medication.
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,My apologies then :)
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,In my experience both are.
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,Maybe I just like my privacy more than most but over sharing my medical issues is NOT a side effect of my ADHD.

Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"not really , because being on meds turned me into zombie , no social life , no more hobbies , i just kept going to work then home thats all , jeez i didn't even go to get a haircut. I am hesitant to try another med at this point."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"It depends per medication.

Ritalin for example improves the chances of heart issues & heart diseases (which in general is more common for the ADHD medications)

If you are a kid it can also stop or slow down your growth.

One of the things Ritalin also causes (among more medicines) is the dry mouth issue which in turn causes teeth issues (which I've had personally unfortunately).

Most (except heart issues) problems are definitely fixable like the teeth one, it really just requires more attention to it in contrast to people who don't take it."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Yeah man like i said, everyone should make their own decisions about it. Not the people around you.

Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"See, and this isn't always the best way. me and my team are ALL ADHD or AuDHD and for all of us, the ability to unmask at work and just be us and play to our strengths while shoring up each other's weak points is AMAZING. Every single member of the team is all ""bro, i've never worked somewhere like this, this is amazing.""

It all depends on how good the trust is."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"It’s not true that HR isn’t on your side. HR is on your side when it comes to mental/physical disabilities. They’re supposed to adhere to ADA regulations and it’s against the law if they don’t. I disclose my disabilities to HR in every job I have so that I can receive the accommodations that my doctor recommends in order to perform my job at the same capacity as everyone else. 

It’s against the law for HR to disclose any personal information to your managers, too. All they can tell your manager is to adhere to your accommodations. If your manager doesn’t, they get fired. 

There’s absolutely no way that HR can go against you for disclosing your mental/physical disabilities.  The ADA protects people with disabilities in the workplace, school, and beyond."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,">I only gave one to my dad who doesn't get immediately addicted to them if he takes one or two due to self-restraint..just needs them to focus on driving long distances like driving in Los Angeles when he helped move my youngest sister back home to Phoenix.

Why are so many people against me taking meds?,The unfortunate reality of oversharing as a symptom 😅
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"If you are asking me- I say it’s up to you. 

Given each persons uniqueness on the spectrum - given unique life situations - given unique medication - each has to find what works for them. 

I was slightly sarcastic when I said “the most positive feedback”  - because others were way darker - questing the diagnosis, the pharma industry, my morality & ethics."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"You aren't ""hooked"" on it, they're implying you're *addicted* to it, like a junkie. If you take prescription medication because you *need it to function* then you are not ""hooked"" on your meds."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"I see your point regards the reduced neuroplasticity. 

For context; 

- I got diagnosed pretty late in life - which now I understand why it was chaotic / abnormal with high highs and low lows  in many areas.

- I recently l started Vyvance 30 mg and feel a slight positive difference.  

- Hence was glad  to be made aware of the fact that I could / should leverage this ability to be “mind-fog” free  to build better habits - knowing that habits stick very well for me and for most on the spectrum. 

- will it work - not sure, but hope is a good thing. 

When I said that was  most positive comment I was sarcastic  - others were way off - like, 

- “ ADHD is  a fabrication of the pharma industry, just get disciplined” 

or

- “You  just need to be practicing your faith diligently,  to find peace &  wellness” 

Or

- “ How come none others in the family  have this challenge, your just morally corrupted”"
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Actually, research shows that only 10% of kid's get ""cured"". The meds will only make the brain mature, but the ADHS stays for the remaining 90%...
As a late diagnosed adult, you can fetch up the brain-maturiy by high enough medication."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,That was the most positive of all others 🤣
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Don’t know, I just liked it because it was accepting & not  offensive as some of the others."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Or just take the drug and keep taking it because it helps. I don't know why you think you should taper off a drug that's working for you. Listen to your doctor and read the double blind, randomized trials. If you're having side effects or it's too intense then sure, manage your dose, but telling people they have to minimize their drug use is the same kind of weird moralizing the OP is complaining about."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"ADHD is “on a spectrum”, like other mental conditions.  It isn’t like COVID, where you can have a Pass / Fail test, and you’re either sick, or you’re not. 


So, some people may have a more milder case of ADHD than others. 


And just like some people respond well to Adderall but others don’t and respond better to Ritalin, etc, for some going to therapy or developing your own system works, but others still require meds no matter what. 

Like how some people only needs reading glasses, others should wear them 100% of the time but don’t and others are effectively blind without them. "
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Thank you for sharing fhat perspective. 

Gueas it makes sense, especially because ADHD brain has a strong endocannabinoid circuitry - which helps to maintain habits - good or bad. 

Just a matter of leveraging the medication to form the good habits, & wean off the bad - without the need for extrinsic motivation."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,Yeah i don't mind becoming reliant on them? Without them i don't function and i'm a mess? So yeah? Hopefully i take them often i want to enjoy living lol
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"There are also multiple studies showing that stimulant medications gradually rewire ADHD brains in positive ways.  The longer you use them, the better your brain gets at doing the things the meds have been helping with."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Fascinating! Being in recovery, I’ve also found that being medicated has helped me stay clean and sober (going on one year now). I now truly believe that my substance abuse issues are related to genetics as my father was an addict and mother has ADHD herself. I realize now that I was desperately searching for a way to “feel normal”. And I’ve found that many friends in recovery have clearly gone through life with undiagnosed ADHD (plus other stuff and trauma), which enabled them to seek relief in other substances. People with ADHD are more likely to have substance abuse issues as well, and hence, live a shorter life. It would be great to have some sort of pamphlet with actual facts like such to combat toxic stereotypes."

Why are so many people against me taking meds?,That's wild to me. What genius decided to start on a higher dose and work down? That's mental!

Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"If you tried on a pair of shoes that were too small so they hurt your feet, made it hard to walk, gave you leg cramps, etc, would you just never wear shoes again, or would you try on a different pair to see if they fit better?"
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,I’m sorry to hear that :( sounds like me before I got on meds. Hope you find something that works for you
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,If you dont have heart issues or high bp before meds the risk is minimal. My bp got better after starting meds due to not having sky high cortisol from stress and being on edge 24/7. Im alive today becauce of treatment for the diagnosis and would gladly die a few years sooner from heart issues when i get older if that means beeing able to live and enjoy my life until then. My belief is that severe adhd is almost impossible to deal with unmedicated.

Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Hey, legally then, at least they can't fire you for anything related to the ADHD. It's a documented & diagnosed disability covered by ADA"
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"It definitely depends on who you work for. I’m AuDHD. I think it would be interesting to work with all adhd or AuDHD. I can say that I would not trust any of my past employers with my disabilities. Unfortunately, I’ve not worked with the nicest companies even if they were a well known corporation or a small private business. With one small company, I had to say I was diabetic to even get a break for lunch!! I wanted to say “Yes, I need to eat just like my coworkers” but I also needed a break from the overwhelming drama and chaos."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"While this is all technically true, two things to note:

1) The ADA only applies in the US.  Many other jurisdictions have similar things, but the legal does and don't vary.

2) In order for the ADA to be enforced, you have to be able to prove the violation, which is typically very difficult.  The larger the corporation and the more regulated it is in other areas of the company, the more likely they are to strictly adhere to other regulations such as the ADA.  Mid-size corporations in fields that aren't heavily regulated, HR is just as likely to be weaponized in regards to the ADA as they are to adhere to it."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,HR is not on your side - sorry their job is to optimise the work force that’s all
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"HR can't do it *directly*, but don't be surprised if when some thing 'unwanted' comes to light, disability or protected trait they don't like or just them *not liking how you make you sandwiches*, suddenly every single thing will be under a microscope.

They won't fire you because you have a disability or because you're \[\]sexual, they'll fire you because of attendance issues or your job being made redundant (in 3 months there'll be a job posting with a different title and the same duties), or someone will manufacture some hearsay bullshit and HR will take their side because they were looking for an excuse."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,Everyone needs to pop some stimulants while driving in that mess anyway 🤣🤣🤣
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Yes I am. I'm hooked. Like a junkie. I get withdrawal symptoms if I stop, like a junkie. Also, that's perfectly fine and if I have to stop I'll get through the withdrawal and no longer be hooked. 

You've missed my point entirely. Stop pretending that addiction is inherently evil, stop demonizing people who struggle with it, stop pretending you're any different."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"""ADHD is a fabrication of the pharma industry, just get disciplined""

Oh, the Irony!  Discipline...
I Got good grades on my own.
The Only one of my siblings to make it to Uni, and finished
The Only one who can claim to be Bilingual, working on tri.
First of Fam to live outside the country
Best credit score of fam
Searched for and purchased own home. 

 Im the token, Im the smart weirdo, the running joke, the novelty, the trophy child to brag about, the one to be seen but never listened to. It took so much discipline to try to be the good at everything, vuz thats what was expected, but nobody understood all the extra work I put into it.  

And I know my family's opinions on mental health by the humour and opinions they share when no one is around to be offended. I know better than to share my "" weaknesses"" with them. They love me, in their own way, but they also know how to hurt me. My Armour is that I run circles around them, Im confident in what I know, and I dont let them know who I really am, cuz they dont like that person, and I dont need them to. 


“ How come none others in the family have this challenge?""  
Once the nieces and nephews started coming, I was the one they enjoyed spending time with because I didnt have to yell or threaten to get compliance. And when they started getting diagnosed, no one made the connection of why I wasnt like the other adults, or why I knew about alternative adult-child interactions when I had no kids of my own. They still cant appreciate why I think/do things differently, and they never will. Theyll just point to my sucesses and 
say how I managed without diagosis and meds, not realizing I survived despite and often because of the undiagnosed situation that is Me. 

But, I dont expect them to understand or empathise."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,I hadn’t had a genuine deep belly laugh unless I forgot to take my meds. Humor is so important to me and laughing is a delightful side effect of ADHD. Unpopular opinion on this page for sure :)
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,I wondering if my dose Vyvanse too low. Will discuss with my provider but I have forgotten to take it a few days and didn’t notice much difference.
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,Appreciate you hearing it out!
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Oh yeah, that's what I'm referencing. Use your meds. I had the ""Reliance"" conversation with my Bio sister and it's like...... Bitch, your kids wear glasses and you self medicate with booze, I don't want to hear it. I of course didn't say it like that but pulled out all the stops of You tolerate and encourage the use of aide for the disabled. Please stop trying to treat what my medical professionals say I need to help me differently."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,Hey that's awesome about your year of sobriety! I'm proud of you!
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,Congrats!
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Lmfao get your panties out of wad, nobody copped an attitude with you Jesus. Meds must’ve worn off already didn’t they?  Yeah I’m glad I can keep personal information just that, personal. Learning to filter is very beneficial and you end up not setting yourself up for failure and disappointment."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"No for sure i see your point , I tried adderal too. Besides meds its more of a problem of depression and anxiety with me, being on concerta(less adhd symptoms made it my other mental issues more obvious) , Also I was burnt out due to job and stuff perhaps i should try getting on lower dose or different meds and give it a go again"

Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"In some cases, no they’re not. In other cases, yes they are. I have always had positive experiences when it comes to disclosing my disability to employers, and I’ve never been in trouble for telling them that. I still have my job.

If you see it that way, then that’s you. But my experience is different from yours. Sorry!"
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"Exactly!! The moment I told my employer I got diagnosed with ADHD and required work accommodations, they immediately put me under a microscope. My manager would write me up for all kinds of bullshit. From being 3-5 minutes late, staying past my clock out time, not taking a full hour lunch, to not communicating with my fellow coworkers. When clearly I did, the EMR system we used would show if the other person read your message, well in this case it showed that that other employee read my fucking message. The manager had the fucking AUDACITY to say, ""well you don't really know if she actually read it!"" Like what the actual fuck!?! Within a month, I was fired."

Why are so many people against me taking meds?,"that's not an opinion at all, that's just something that happened to you. you're getting downvoted because you're vaguely extrapolating your experience into general advice for everyone."
Why are so many people against me taking meds?,Vyvanse or lisdexamfetamine is dextroamphetamine (the stronger isomer of amphetamine) that is cleaved with a lysine molecule so the bioavailability of the dextroamphetamine once it's metabolized is hindered by the lysine so 30mg of vyvanse is like 10mg of dextroamphetamine. Just FYI
