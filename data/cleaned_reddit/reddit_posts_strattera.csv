This is vague, but since I've started Strattera:

1. I have been able to be more consistent with discipline with my kids - which has led to better behaviors, bad habits leaving.

2. My coworker who still drives me nuts, drives me significantly less nuts because I've been able to draw boundaries.

3. I had some issues in my marriage (HUGE issues) that resolved.

4. I used to drink alot of liquor and wine, and I am now almost 10 days quit, and don't feel like I need that dopamine hit anymore.

5. My relationship with food has balanced out, normalized, and I don't feel like I can't control myself around food. Another dopamine issue.

Idk if this would help, but I stayed the course and things actually got better when I finally levelled out.","i am the same way honestly i have a bit of a short fuse and i get really overstimulated very easily i feel like taking that medicine showed me how big of a mess my life was

If wellbutrin is not enough, then introduce a stimulant dose for combination therapy. Wellbutrin has blood pressure lowering effects, so you will not encounter the same problem.

You can try cutting out all processed food and all meats, eggs and dairy for a while. Whole food plant based is a diet used to treat heart diseases and plaque in the arteries. You can check out the documentary What the Health.

Over the previous Jan-October I went from 25 to 50 to 75 as my body adapted. Found it was perfect for a bit at 50 and then was overcome with anxiety and depression- not too severe but negatively impacting my day to day. I upped it to 75 and the depression was so much worse. Got off and I think the issue was 50 was already too much but didn’t impact me until it has built up in my system after around 2-3 months. I wish I had gone down to 40 rather jumping up to 75 but I didn’t realize what was going on. I thought it wasn’t working because I had adapted too quick to the dose. I got off on halloween and woke up the next day no longer feeling depressed. Have been so happy and motivated since. Strange since the first 6 months I was on Strattera, it most definitely improved my mental health and worked as an anti depressant. I struggle with fatigue and it was no longer there. I could get so much done in my day to day and generally felt so much happier 24/7. It made getting through my shifts easy and my work ethic was incredible. It also helped with hunger cues and no longer was binging at night. I used to smoke weed 24/7 for a few years and then only at night by the end but Strattera immediately caused me to lose interest in it as I didn’t crave the relief anymore. While it made me happy and focused, it isolated my anxiety so that was there but manageable until about month 7. By August my sleep was just fever dreams and I was waking up more tired and stressed than before going to bed. Aside from that the nausea was impossible to deal with by the end.

strattera,"It's not likely to do anything for POTS and might make it worse. I personally take it for ADHD and have not noticed worsening of my POTS while on it (except for the initial two weeks or so, but the side effects went away) but here's a study about how it often can make it worse: 

[Effects of norepinephrine reuptake inhibition on postural tachycardia syndrome](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24002370/)

> Conclusion: Norepinephrine reuptake inhibition with atomoxetine acutely increased standing HR and symptom burden in patients with POTS.

other forms of dysautonomia could theoretically benefit from it. here's a paper on the use of low dose atomoxetine in patients with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (which i guess makes sense because it's known to increase blood pressure):

[Efficacy of atomoxetine versus midodrine for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.50968)

however, here's another paper discussing how this property can mean that it can also cause hypertension (high blood pressure) in those with impaired autonomic function:

[Norepinephrine Transporter Blockade With Atomoxetine Induces Hypertension in Patients With Impaired Autonomic Function](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/hypertensionaha.107.089961)

> Atomoxetine, a selective norepinephrine transporter blocker, could increase blood pressure by elevating norepinephrine concentration in peripheral sympathetic neurons. This effect may be masked in healthy subjects by central sympatholytic mechanisms. To test this hypothesis we studied the pressor effect of 18 mg of atomoxetine (pediatric dose) in 21 patients with damage of the central (10 subjects) and peripheral (11 subjects) autonomic nervous system.

it's complicated. ask your doctor.","its not likely to do anything for pots and might make it worse i personally take it for adhd and have not noticed worsening of my pots while on it except for the initial two weeks or so but the side effects went away but heres a study about how it often can make it worse

strattera,I definitely decrease’s overthinking one thing you have to do with mental health is you have constantly reshape your inner monologue. You inner monologue caused by parenting or childhood environment is root cause of most mental health disorders. You need to take medication to slow down those overwhelming thoughts and constantly reshape your inner monologue it takes years of practice to undo what your personality has become as a child since its easier to form those connections in early years. You go back to default mode which you have to constantly actively fight from conscious mind. Because be now its like iceberg the part thats shows up is your conscious self but part thats hidden your unconscious mind is running all these monologue in background so you have to actively beware of those and reshape that.

strattera,"It definitely depends on the thing you’re buying. With Metamucil being just a simple psyllium husk I don’t think it matters. But when it comes to generic medications apparently it does matter despite what I was told my entire life. My buddy was in PA school and did some massive research paper on generics. With brand name there is better quality control and they can often have patents on the release mechanism of a drug. Generics have to find their own release mechanism and have fillers, both of which can cause a medication to have an adverse effect on the patient. Not only that but the chemical chains of a generic can sometimes be flipped which makes them “legally correct” but can also cause them to be ineffective.

My insurance through my work has many barriers in place that do not allow me to circumvent the extreme cost of a brand name drug. I think the only way to get the brand name at a reasonable price for me would be if they ran out of generic and had to substitute. I can’t even have my psychiatrist order it with a DAW-1 code to avoid the cost. My stimulant still ends up being over $300 for a month.

So just jump to the therapeutic dose and wait out the side effects and be at the therapeutic dose instead of dragging it out and adding unnecessary adjustment times. 

I work in psychiatry (nurse) and the guidelines for antipsychotics and antidepressants are doing the same thing- we used to go up really slowly but then people were just sick still while waiting so long to get up to a dose that helps. They noticed in people who were very ill that people rushed treatment on were having adjustment periods the same as with lower doses but then getting better sooner because they were at therapeutic dose the whole time- so as more testing and experience is being done, meds that don’t have very severe side effects, basically you’re just checking for allergies or side effects and then diving in!

Its been higher, but Ive managed to lower it slightly with a lot of walking and working out. I expect I'll be able to lower it further over time with staying active. 

I wear a smartband and monitor my heart rate throughout the day, and its pretty wild to see the big jump. During more active parts of the day my heart rate hovers between 85 and 115. When the medicine kicks in, its not uncommon that my heart rate jumps to 140 for a short while then falls back to more normal levels. My heart rate also spikes much higher now when working out and I need to take slightly longer breaks when lifting weights because I get out of breath easier.

Ive generally seems an increase in heart rate at each dose increase, and its fallen down a little after a couple of months. 

Its all pretty normal according to my psych, as long as blood pressure is in the normal range.","my resting heart rate went from  to about  which is very much in line with much in line with the average expected increase that studies report its been higher but ive managed to lower it slightly with a lot of walking and working out i expect ill be able to lower it further over time with staying active 

i wear a smartband and monitor my heart rate throughout the day and its pretty wild to see the big jump during more active parts of the day my heart rate hovers between  and  when the medicine kicks in its not uncommon that my heart rate jumps to  for a short while then falls back to more normal levels my heart rate also spikes much higher now when working out and i need to take slightly longer breaks when lifting weights because i get out of breath easier

strattera,"It’s a good question, I think it’s also worthwhile asking who also drinks a cup (or more) of coffee whilst on the medicine during the daytime.

strattera,"I don’t want to speak out of turn against what your doctor has advised you, but this just sounds like a way to extend your side effects. A lot of what’s online about this is that you don’t need to taper off in the same way you do with other medications you may be likely to have tried. I certainly wasn’t told to do this.  But if you’re going to do it, and of course I don’t advise against it since it’s what you’ve been advised to do by the person in charge of your care, I think the best thing would just be to make sure you take it easy and don’t put too many demands on yourself during the days that you’re tapering off. I know that may be easier said than done and you may have nonnegotiable obligations, but it would be my main thought on it.

What are you planning on switching to (if anything). And do you know if that medicine is likely to raise your HR?

Did you doc (or you), check your blood pressure also when Strattera was taken and in your system at fuller strength a few hours later, cause I’m sure that would be up also. I’m just not sure what meds don’t bring HR and BP up slightly.
