concerta,"The easiest way to find out is to ask if you can move up to 36mg.  Might work, might not.

But in the meantime, look for changes in your routine.  Starting university is stressful, structureless and anxiety-inducing and it's no doubt caused significant changes in the exact things that affect how methylphenidate works.

Compared to last summer:

* Are you eating as much as you were?
* Are you sleeping as much and as well as you were?
* Are you staying as hydrated as you were?
* Are you exercising as much as you were?
* Did you increase any other kind of stimulant, like caffeine or nicotine?

concerta,"These are probably questions for your kid’s doctor.

It sounds good that you’re screening him in case of other health concerns.

As for additional meds, I think strattera might be an option. Maybe wellbutrin or intuniv. Not sure if any of these are okay for kids though. 

Also some people experience a significant difference in brand name concerta vs generic. It can be a real thing with this med. Seems to depend on the specific generic and also the specific person. Caution, if you google, you may find horror stories of people swearing the generic is straight garbage. It’s not, please take that with a grain of salt. Truth is some generics work perfectly great for some people, myself included. But, it is true that some generics do not work as well in some bodies. So, it’s possible that brand name could work better for your son. 

If you’re looking for other things to think about, here’s a list of random things to consider. Overall you are the parent and you know your kid best, this is just a list to brainstorm with. 

It is okay to get a second opinion and/or see a specialist.

If medication is through a general/family doctor, consider if seeing a psychiatrist with experience with ADHD might be of benefit.

Consider if therapy (like talk therapy) might be of benefit. (If your insurance covers it, there’s not much downside in trying it out imo.)

Consider if other support services might be beneficial: Adhd support groups, organizing help, school tutors.

Consider nutrition: particularly protein and water. An easy way to check that box as an adult is to have a protein shake at breakfast. Not sure if kids can do that. If not maybe even just a glass of milk? Greek yogurt? Smoothie? Especially if they don’t currently eat breakfast, or eat simple carbs like poptarts. Protein seems to help (I think it contains construction materials for dopamine) and water is needed to help the pill absorb best.

Consider if exercise might benefit & if it’s possible add some in. Exercise is supposed to be beneficial for a ton of mental health stuff, physical health stuff, and ADHD in particular. (People with ADHD may fidgety or be hyperactive because movement can generate dopamine). Perhaps get the whole family involved so it doesn’t feel like he’s being “punished” with exercise. Or maybe there is an older cousin or uncle who might take him under his wing at the gym etc. 

Consider if either parent(s) or sibling(s) might benefit from being screened for ADHD, as it has a strong genetic component. 

Consider if medication break(s) might be beneficial. For both tolerance and overall health (I think height can be slightly impacted long-term).

Consider that he’ll be hitting his teens in a few years, and might be more interested in building muscle or playing team sports or whatever teen boys get interested in these days. 

Along with, hitting his teens in a few years, comes with bigger emotions, school responsibilities, social navigation, etc. So starting to work on skills with a therapist etc beginning now might really have a big impact especially as the years go on. 

“Pills don’t make skills”. I’m a big believer in medication, but I’m also a believer in non-med supports and strategies. My opinion is they are two separate halves of a whole. I don’t think any amount of therapy or homework strategies can replace meds. But I also think there is a very real place for therapy and deliberate skill building and strategies.

Medication gives me the ability to use a lot more “tools”. But I still gotta learn about the tools, how to use them, and then actually use them. Meds without skills are like working arms but not having a hammer (or having a hammer but not knowing how to use it). Can’t get the nail in. Therapy/skills without meds is like having a great hammer and knowing exactly how and when to use it, but having no arms or t-rex arms or arms that don’t really work. Still can’t get the nail in. Need to have good arms & a good hammer to get stuff done. That’s what I mean by two separate halves of a whole & that one doesn’t replace the other. 

Sorry for this got too long. Good luck!","these are probably questions for your kids doctor

it sounds good that youre screening him in case of other health concerns

as for additional meds i think strattera might be an option maybe wellbutrin or intuniv not sure if any of these are okay for kids though 

also some people experience a significant difference in brand name concerta vs generic it can be a real thing with this med seems to depend on the specific generic and also the specific person caution if you google you may find horror stories of people swearing the generic is straight garbage its not please take that with a grain of salt truth is some generics work perfectly great for some people myself included but it is true that some generics do not work as well in some bodies so its possible that brand name could work better for your son 

if youre looking for other things to think about heres a list of random things to consider overall you are the parent and you know your kid best this is just a list to brainstorm with 

it is okay to get a second opinion andor see a specialist

concerta,"I guess it would be better to take the same dosage, and take a booster dose os Ritalin IR at the end of the effects (He being a kid and maybe couldn't describe very well where the meds seems to wear off); Also, you're the parent, you should control his diet - he actually can eat as much as he want, if the food isn't highly caloric dense.

	•	This adjustment allowed me to lower my Concerta dose to 54mg and add 10mg of Ritalin in the afternoon.

I do have my one daughter on it who is 17 but she had to go to a psychiatrist because with her ADHD anything that she went on it caused her anxiety and depression to go absolutely nuts and so she could not do a stimulant. 
So he sees paediatric doctor (child specialist) especially every three months and not just a family doctor. (In a sense it’s his family doctor, it a practice with four other paediatricians) he does have four older sisters, three of which have been diagnosed with ADHD as well as ODD and SPD, which he has also been diagnosed with. His sister is in the process of being diagnosed with ADHD as well. She was just more of an inattentive type that sadly with the others I missed. 

As for the medication itself, he will only prescribe the Concerta namebrand. He will not prescribe the generic. So that’s a plus. 

I do appreciate the talk therapy. He does see someone I looked into that just recently because my ex and I separated, and they were young, but I realize that sometimes, even though they were young, they still needed some sort of guidance that I was not able to give them.  The one that they see, she does deal with the nervous system and tries to get them to understand their own nervous system and why their bodies react the way they do, especially having ADHD! 

I will try and figure out the breakfast part ! I work about 45 minutes away before he leaves for school so I don’t know exactly what he has for breakfast half the time or if he has breakfast! so if I give him a protein shake before I leave hopefully that could help! We have talked about portion control and not in a bad way just how it’s OK to have all foods just we need to balance it with our proteins and vegetables/fruits etc. 

The crazy part is with him he is pretty active . Don’t get me wrong. He does play on his video games, but we do have a park in a basketball court and a soccer net behind us and he’s always outside. And he does play sports in the summer, the winter is a little bit more tough for us here in Canada he’s not really into hockey lol But he does like taking the dogs for walks. 

Medication breaks - this one I don’t really give it to him in the summer. There are days that I do days that I don’t. in the winter time I tend to every day while he has school he definitely takes it, on the weekends if there’s something I need him to be able to focus he will take it but most weekends he doesn’t take it.

concerta,"A few things I would recommend:

- Always eat first thing in the morning - even if you’re not hungry (before you take the medication) and make sure it’s a filling breakfast with plenty of protein otherwise you’ll struggle.

- I find exercise a very good way of combatting the eating thing (although I try never go shopping after a gym workout as I just want to but the shop I’m so hungry - again might just be me). 

- Exercise during the day and wind down techniques at night could also help with your bed time routine and it could help you get a decent nights sleep - things like reading before bed, no electronic devices an hour or two before bed, maybe some mindfulness or yoga etc…

- If the crash is rough then maybe ask your doctor about an instant release methylphenidate tablet you can take when you fell like you’re crashing (I took this for a while but found eventually that I didn’t need it).","a few things i would recommend

concerta,"Most of us struggle with it.  There's no cheat code. You just have to manage it.

One thing that really helps is a HUGE breakfast full of protein.  Pack as much nutrition into it as you can, because it's the last meal you'll WANT to eat.  Figure out what doesn't make you nauseous and eat a lot of it.

Then at dinnertime, you just gotta do some math on what you ate, figure out what you're short on, and eat it.  Nobody's going to do it for you, especially if you're a woman.  Men get past this by having wives who will feed them like literal children, but that's never going to work for you.

I will say this, though... It's highly likely that your lack of eating is why you're needing such a high dose of methylphenidate, and most certainly causing the bad crashes.  This drug needs to be fed to work properly.

- Making sure I eat whole foods with high protein and fiber content. So won’t waste meals on ultra processed garbage.
- Take supplements. Aminoacids, vitamins and antioxidants
- Have lower doses (36 and 18) for lighter days that allow me to increase my caloric intake

concerta,"Despite my Dr pushing me repeatedly to go up I've never tolerated more than 18mg. It's the baby dose and it doesn't ""fix"" me, but ask yourself if you're actually broken before you take high doses of meds. 

Our brains work how they work and stimulants kind of just mask the difference. It has downsides as well and you can lose your strengths. 

I did my PhD entirely off my meds and honestly it was better because I followed my rabbit holes. I hyperfocused. I didn't read my mail or make my bed or anything of that junk but I enjoyed what I was doing and finished in 3 years 3 months with a good publication set (many people go 5, even 7 years). 

I take the baby dose so I can get all of the boring stuff done, but it's getting easier and easier with more tech. My bills are all auto paid. My email inbox is prioritised and even reminds me when I haven't followed up yet. I can speak reminders to my phone in the 2 sec they are in my brain. Alexa shouts things at me. My phone will even tell me based on traffic when I should leave for an appointment. Basically you can have AI executive function these days. 

I would look at whether *you* want the things that high meds bring or whether it's some expectation pushed on you. Are you unhappy and struggling with your ADHD because of you or because of old fashioned expectations in society? 

I do think the tide is turning and it's more and more ok to ask others to meet you half way. E.g. even a decade ago I would never have told anyone I had ADHD. Fast forward to 2022, I told my boss a couple months in about it and explained how I experience certain things. 

At some point, he had a mild complaint from a person we were working with about me interrupting with questions a lot. I'm doing machine learning and mathematical modelling and I have a lot of questions and my ADHD makes me blurt them out sometimes (again tech helps because when it's online I can turn my microphone off and nobody hears me blurt out questions and I then remember to write them down and wait instead). 

Anyway, he explained to this person that I am very engaged in the work and excited and very thorough and those things are strengths and he would ask me to do my best not to interrupt, but he asked her to consider the fact that I'm not changing the subject but rather really excited and interested in what she's saying.  He explained I was aware of my tendency and that I try to control it, but if I don't it's because  I really want to work with her to solve her problem. He didn't mention ADHD because he didn't have my permission to. He told me about this in a private meeting.  After that, I tried really extra hard and she genuinely seemed less annoyed when I lost control and the project ended up winning awards. If I drugged myself up to the point where I couldn't stomach anything but candy, I wouldn't have interrupted but I also wouldnt have had all of the ideas that made the project really successful. 

I would say try a much lower dose, set up your AI executive function and see if *you're* ok being you. And if people around you aren't ok with it, ask them to adjust their expectations half way.","despite my dr pushing me repeatedly to go up ive never tolerated more than mg its the baby dose and it doesnt fix me but ask yourself if youre actually broken before you take high doses of meds

If I take Concerta 36mg around 9am I start feeling that way around 3/4pm if I haven't taken my booster, generally what's happening is that the medication is wearing off and your body is rebounding, for me this increases my blood pressure, heart rate and I end up getting anxious for a few hours, I take 20mg Propanolol to help with that and its been working great for me, I'm still not sure if I want to stay on Concerta, I have a doctors appointment soon to get results from my cardiologist to see if I should continue the med or not because without Propanolol my heart rate can stay 110bpm+ for hours on end 

I still can't figure out what induces it or what affects it, sometimes it happens after I eat because my body has to work harder, which as a result makes my heart beat faster which induces anxiety - then again this is just my theory

concerta,"Just typed out the longest response and accidentally swiped away BUT, experienced this when I first started Concerta almost a decade ago. My doctors recommended the following: upping your water intake 2-3x normal (or the recommended amount, if you don’t drink that daily) for the first two weeks, and then be sure to actively monitor your hydration moving forward. And be sure to force yourself to eat a sufficient amount, which can be tough when you’re starting so small amounts throughout the day are good too. This worked for me to get adjusted to the medication.

When the chest pains start, try taking an NSAID + GasX or Pepto with 16oz of water. I still have occasional episodes of this (once a year or so), and in working with my med team found this combo to be effective.

I love all that, that’s not fair 😓. And I haven’t been going to the gym nearly that much. But I started listening to this advice a few people gave me: 
Don’t be so hard on yourself.

When a task gives me anxiety that’s when concerta really helps, I can just do the thing and see that it’s not that bad and every time it gets easier because my brain sees that there was nothing to worry about. When I don’t take concerta I panic inside about tasks or conversations or what every dumb things go through my head that are big at that time but inconsequential in the long run.","i hate that feeling of anxiety lingering around when there is no reason for it my cousin will like stand up and kind of bend in half to flip her head upside down and come back up she says it helps im not sure sometimes i ignore it sometimes i try different things  cold shower hot bath change clothes wash face move to a different room go outside eat carbs or comfort food not my best attempted solution chew gum or lay down and decompress sometimes its sensory like my pants are too tight im uncomfortable or my skins itchy but im busy so i dont directly notice

concerta,"I know what you mean with the fuzzy feeling, the way I experience it and the way my doctor explained is that this med sort of quiets your brain down a lot in order for you to focus on important things. She told me this because I was concerned why I was falling asleep a few hours into taking it. It’s because I was so calmed by the medication (and I wasn’t getting enough sleep at night) that it made me settle down to sleep. 

As far as feeling if the medication is working, it’s pretty hard to tell. I don’t take it every single day, only on days I work or have a lot to get done. You will notice a difference in your productivity. If I take my concerta and I’m just staying home, I will start deep cleaning things. When I first started taking it the efficacy seemed to wear off after a week or two on a smaller dose. It got better when I increased my dose. 

Another important part about this medication is the timing. I’m sure you know this but if you take it too late you will be up all night, too early and it won’t last throughout your day. You just need to find your sweetspot time and this should makw the “crash” more manageable.","i know what you mean with the fuzzy feeling the way i experience it and the way my doctor explained is that this med sort of quiets your brain down a lot in order for you to focus on important things she told me this because i was concerned why i was falling asleep a few hours into taking it its because i was so calmed by the medication and i wasnt getting enough sleep at night that it made me settle down to sleep

concerta,"heyyy :) I was on 60mg Elvanse but I actually completely stopped taking it since around May(?) due to how bad the crash was (was starting to get depressive thoughts), I don't know if that will affect tolerance or not, Elvanse only lasted 5 hours tops for me, I'm hoping Concerta will last longer

I only got my official diagnosis last Monday (finally 😭) and that's why I'm starting Concerta now, yesterday I messed up cause I got the generic version 💀 so today is my actual first day of taking it

I definetely think the dose is too low for me (18mg) because it's barely doing anything but I can tell that the side-effects will probably be less harsh than with Elvanse, even when I up my dose, because I'm only feeling bad anxiety (I already have anxiety issues so I think any meds will make it bad), not as bad as with Elvanse, and some really mild nausea and headache, which is definitely being worsened by the fact that my eating and hydration habits have been absolutely abysmal and I haven't worked out in months

concerta,"Yeah for sure, I have a tendency towards anxiety for sure but not enough for an actual diagnosis so our circumstances are different. I started on 18 mg for a week and at the end of it I was undecided whether I should continue on meds or not at all. The positives and negatives were about even at that stage. On the plus side, I was productive and felt positive for half a day but on the other hand I had trouble sleeping , was emotionally flat, felt like a zombie when I took a break and felt like I was veering towards anxiety once of twice.
Then I took a break for a week and went back to 27mg and had much better results. Who knows why? Maybe because I took a week off, or because the dose suited me better or my brain had become used to it? Anyway it was a more or less a totally good week, no real side effects except maybe a bit more difficulty falling asleep. 
I did not think I was going to be one of those people who had such success but here I am. Touch wood. Hope it continues like this. 
I’m sure you are well aware of all these things but do make sure you are fully fueled up in terms of food, even if you don’t feel hungry, drink plenty of water and make sure you are sleeping enough. I really believe these things can influence the effect of the meds on you enormously but I’m sure you have heard all that before. 
I hope it works out for you!

Yeah it was awful, I struggled SO BAD with executive dysfunction, and I had a reduced course-load and accommodations, except I didn’t know I had ADHD, so I didn’t have all the accommodations I needed. Even with the reduced course load I was struggling to start and complete assignments and it would pile up so quickly and I would be smothered. Its a course I LOVE too but that didn’t make a difference for my lack of motivation and such. I also have seizures and tics that are brought on my stress and fatigue so those got SO bad and my health just plummeted. Once I got my ADHD diagnosis and the recommendations my psychologist gave me I was like holy shit. So much of that struggle was ADHD and I had NO IDEA for my whole life 😭 But now I can finally try medication for it, and Concerta may not be working properly right now with the side effects but even the positive effects it gave me shows me how much potential meds have. Definitely gonna look into other meds but I’m relieved to have this option now!","thank you

Hearing others experiences and such really helps me with the anxiety part of it and helps me feel less alone, so I appreciate it a lot. ❤️

Yeah I have heard about staying hydrated and eating well, I unfortunately haven’t been eating well with the loss of appetite and it’s probably having an effect on the meds for sure.

I’m on day 4 now, and honestly the only main side effects now that I am noticing is a strong full body fuzzy feeling, and anxiety/nervousness, and for some reason, brain dog and lack of concentration. I have noticed the positive effects seem harder to tell if they are working anymore, as I’m more foggy and honestly really having trouble thinking entirely. Other than that, everything else is fine, but I honestly don’t think this med is working for me at this dose or this med at all. Although, I’m only day 4, so its hard to tell, and things may level out. 

I see my doctor again this Thursday, so I’ll see what she thinks! For now I’m gonna keep taking them and try and focus on eating/drinking enough and monitoring my symptoms.","thank you

concerta,"Just on what you were saying about concentration and brain fog etc.I found (especially during the first week) that it helped with concentration but only for one thing at a time. So I found it best to try to get on with things/projects/assignments/whatever that I had decided to do in advance.  Everything else went out the window but I was able to really make progress with those single things.  I even got quite forgetful which I’m not usually. I guess my brain was just focusing on the ONE important thing. This has gotten better in the following weeks and I am not so one track now. 

Just to reiterate… food, rest, water are essential. Even if you just have a bite of something every two hours?

concerta,"Hello! I was diagnosed last year around this time when I was 51. Talk about mind blown! It was weird to reframe my entire personality with the new knowledge that explained many of my quirks. All my life since old enough to remember I’ve been beating myself up internally and deliberately avoiding many situations and experiences because I never felt worthy…

Maybe you can relate? It was a really weird couple of months after starting treatment and going back through core memories and understanding them totally differently.

I started last December on 150mg slow release Wellbutrin, which isn’t supposed to be for adhd but many psychs have had good results prescribing it. I was also prescribed 5mg of Ritalin twice a day, but ended up stopping that a few months in becuse I felt the Wellbutrin was doing enough (spoiler alert: it wasn’t)

Wellbutrin isn’t a stimulant, but it sure feels like one to me. The first few weeks were amazing, and often called the ‘Wellbutrin honeymoon’. I tried increasing to 300mg and I’ve read that 450mg is often used for adhd. 300mg made me feel uncomfortable and I felt much better dropping back down to 150mg.

But then I started reading adhd groups and saw that a lot of people had great results on concerta. It’s a little expensive here in Thailand - around $3 per pill, but I decided to try it and was given 27mg to start on. That was around 3 weeks ago now, but here are my experiences - good and bad.

Bad
- Constipation and irritable bowel syndrome type symptoms. 
- Total lack of appetite. I need to force myself to eat and food is just so unappealing… this is VERY unusual for me and I’ve been obese most of my adult life. It got to the point where I was just having coffee and some cookies for breakfast and then some yoghurt with fruit around 8pm. That’s compared to my previous self, where I would plan out the entire day around food and be thinking about the next meal while I was still eating!
- Insomnia. This is a big one for me… if I don’t take it before 10am then I’m often up till 2-3am the following morning. Hopefully  this goes away with time.
- ‘scatter brained’. Some days I feel like I’ve been busy all day but got nothing done! Also making a lot of really stupid decisions and mistakes, but this is getting better as I’m more mindful of it. I will walk into a room and have zero idea why, and this happens a LOT more since starting Concerta.
- Time blindness. This is another weird/new thing for me. My internal clock is totally off.. I will be doing something that feels like a long time, but it’s only been 10 minutes - and vice versa.

Luckily I am self employed, so I can get away with being scatterbrained or using time poorly. I’m not sure how good I’d be handling this if I had a full time job.

Good
- Less appetite is a good thing for me, and I’m kind of grateful that I’m breaking old habits and rethinking my relationship with food. I’m making much better decisions around food and when I do eat it’s healthy stuff. This ties into the increased confidence and self esteem. I WANT to eat better now. 
- Much better overall mood. The constant internal chatter is still there, but it’s more often positive and I even catch myself giving praise. Again, after 4 decades with almost zero self esteem - this has been wonderful.
- increased confidence. I’m in a pretty crappy marriage and felt trapped before and resigned  to the fact that this was all I could hope for. My internal dialogue has totally changed in just a few weeks. Now I’m feeling more empowered and optimistic.
- I can watch an entire movie!!!! I could only do that in cinemas before. The same with watching tutorial videos etc. 


Overall the pros far outweigh the cons and I’ll definitely be continuing this medication. I just need to sort out the constipation and insomnia issues. Good luck to you - I had the same concerns before starting, so I hope my reply helps a little.","hello i was diagnosed last year around this time when i was  talk about mind blown it was weird to reframe my entire personality with the new knowledge that explained many of my quirks all my life since old enough to remember ive been beating myself up internally and deliberately avoiding many situations and experiences because i never felt worthy

maybe you can relate it was a really weird couple of months after starting treatment and going back through core memories and understanding them totally differently

i started last december on mg slow release wellbutrin which isnt supposed to be for adhd but many psychs have had good results prescribing it i was also prescribed mg of ritalin twice a day but ended up stopping that a few months in becuse i felt the wellbutrin was doing enough spoiler alert it wasnt

wellbutrin isnt a stimulant but it sure feels like one to me the first few weeks were amazing and often called the wellbutrin honeymoon i tried increasing to mg and ive read that mg is often used for adhd mg made me feel uncomfortable and i felt much better dropping back down to mg

but then i started reading adhd groups and saw that a lot of people had great results on concerta its a little expensive here in thailand   around  per pill but i decided to try it and was given mg to start on that was around  weeks ago now but here are my experiences   good and bad

bad
  constipation and irritable bowel syndrome type symptoms 
  total lack of appetite i need to force myself to eat and food is just so unappealing this is very unusual for me and ive been obese most of my adult life it got to the point where i was just having coffee and some cookies for breakfast and then some yoghurt with fruit around pm thats compared to my previous self where i would plan out the entire day around food and be thinking about the next meal while i was still eating
  insomnia this is a big one for me if i dont take it before am then im often up till  am the following morning hopefully  this goes away with time
  scatter brained some days i feel like ive been busy all day but got nothing done also making a lot of really stupid decisions and mistakes but this is getting better as im more mindful of it i will walk into a room and have zero idea why and this happens a lot more since starting concerta
  time blindness this is another weirdnew thing for me my internal clock is totally off i will be doing something that feels like a long time but its only been  minutes   and vice versa

luckily i am self employed so i can get away with being scatterbrained or using time poorly im not sure how good id be handling this if i had a full time job

good

concerta,"Welcome to the club.

Yes, impostor syndrome is a real thing. The thing is, the treatment worked. Whatever it is that you may have, likely ADHD, was clearly helped by this treatment. And no psychiatric diagnosis is set in stone, as the brain is quite literally the most complicated organ in the universe.

  
Yes. This is how it works. Concerta won't do your work for you. It just makes it not feel excruciating for our different brains. This is also the start, and there is somewhat of a ""beginning euphoria"". But, the effects don't go away when the euphoria goes. You'll still function. The quiet is the best part. When i first started, i spent four hours bawling my eyes out because i had never known what quiet was in my brain before.


Yes, it is completely normal to not feel any transition. ADHD medication, unlike actual drugs, is very subtle. Especially extended-release formulations. They kick in and wean off gradually by dropping down. As you go longer, you may form some degree of tolerance, which is normal and can happen to anyone. After all, 18mg is the starting dose, and is usually little. Most settle around the 36-54mg mark. You take the pill with a full glass of water \[IMPORTANT\]. It starts kicking in in as little as 15 minutes, where if you try to sleep you won't be able to, and the full effects come on at around the 40-50 minute mark. The pill stops releasing at its peak at about 6-7 hours in, after which for another 3-4 hours your body does the rest, slowly eliminating the compound as it starts to wear off. After it's worn off, you may feel tired, your symptoms slowly come back (much like a normal person, you can't focus at the end of a long day), you get hungrier and you feel more tired.

Please don't blame yourself about the ""drugged up for being lazy"" part. We don't know what ADHD really is, we just have some sort of a general idea, and we know that throwing dopamine at it works. It's a disorder characterized by a vehement refusal of the brain (in most cases) to engage with things it doesn't find in the NICU criterion, that is, Novelty/Challenge/Interest/Urgency. Of course, this is just the tip of the iceberg, and there are many things you will learn about your new life on medication. It is normal.

In any case, read around the sub, and welcome :)  
We've been in your shoes, and still are. I'm also 22 and about to graduate in Electronics and Communications Engineering in a top 50 university, something i would not dare dream of unmedicated. This is to point out that things from now on will change very fast, as you start to fully absorb the concept of what i would confidently call a new life, now that you can actually work towards what you want.

# Some tips:
### Eat well.
Stimulants suppress appetite. Make sure to eat well and eat enough. Stimulants can't stimulate if your brain is running on fumes.

### Sleep well.
Sleep at the same time, wake up at the same time, and sleep a good amount. Your brain needs to replenish its' neurotransmitters.

### Take the pill at consistent times.
Taking the pill at the same time every day (or close) helps keep the time gap between doses consistent, reducing the likelihood of developing a tolerance.

### Exercise.
Exercise helps you feel good, look good, and it increases a lot of your neurotransmitters. I consider it my second medication.

### Stay hydrated.
Seriously. Stimulants make you pee like crazy. Dehydration can cause brain fog and irritability, and generally sucks.

### Take your vitamins and minerals.
It helps to not be deficient in things. Especially iron, B vitamins and magnesium.

### Create a routine.
Break things down in chunks, establish a routine and do everything step by step. Don't get trapped in the urge to do everything at once. Learned habits and learned procrastination are something you'll need to work on breaking now that you are medicated.

concerta,"Thank you so much for your comment, it reassured me so much. I didn't expect the medication to just get me out of bed and make me do stuff, but I was still fascinated to see how easy it is when I think about how I want to do that and actually do it right at that moment. I didn't cry the first day, but I was so in shock at how much can be done in a day when you can just function normally. I've experienced moments of quiet brain before, it was not continuously noisy inside, but instead most of the time and I rarely caught myself having 0 thoughts. But now, experiencing a full day of quietness was honestly so life changing, I didn't even realize this is how most people are!! I thought everyone has a song constantly playing in the back of their head amongst other thoughts and that the moments of not thinking about anything were rare for them as well.

Indeed, at the end of the day I feel tired, less focused and motivated, much like I felt before. I guess what I don't notice is when my brain starts getting noisy again, but I definitely notice it right before falling asleep (though I've always kind of liked daydreaming about a lot of stuff before bed). 

I too am an engineering student by the way :D This is my last year of Computer Engineering at one of the top universities in my country and it's been pretty hard the entire time I've been here (went from an average to top student in high school to ""just barely making it"" in college). I really hope I can turn things around this year though. I can't wait to see where I'll get from now on, I'm very excited for what's to come :D

I want to say thanks a lot for the tips too. Thankfully, I have no problem with eating well since I've been working with a nutritionist this year and I can finally say I have organized my meals. I still have some issues with sleeping (but I'm getting there too) and a very big issue with hydration. I'll try to remember taking the pill with a big glass of water instead of the little gulp I've done the past couple days and also I'll try waking up at about the same hour everyday, I didn't know that not taking it at the same time daily could lead to a tolerance. Is it true about tolerance resetting when not taking it for a few days?

Overall, thank you so much for the support! Happy to be here :)","thank you so much for your comment it reassured me so much i didnt expect the medication to just get me out of bed and make me do stuff but i was still fascinated to see how easy it is when i think about how i want to do that and actually do it right at that moment i didnt cry the first day but i was so in shock at how much can be done in a day when you can just function normally ive experienced moments of quiet brain before it was not continuously noisy inside but instead most of the time and i rarely caught myself having  thoughts but now experiencing a full day of quietness was honestly so life changing i didnt even realize this is how most people are i thought everyone has a song constantly playing in the back of their head amongst other thoughts and that the moments of not thinking about anything were rare for them as well

concerta,"Not taking it at the same time everyday is not proven to contribute to tolerance or anything, but from a strictly scientific standpoint, it would be the best to try to take it as consistently as possible, because the recovery time between each dose would be consistent. Think of it like your brain ""recharging"". If you take it too inconsistently, you may end up with less ""time to recharge"" and that can build up.

  
Also, yes. In my personal experience at least, not taking it for a few days does increase effectiveness a lot for me. I prefer skipping weekends if i dont have something to do.","not taking it at the same time everyday is not proven to contribute to tolerance or anything but from a strictly scientific standpoint it would be the best to try to take it as consistently as possible because the recovery time between each dose would be consistent think of it like your brain recharging if you take it too inconsistently you may end up with less time to recharge and that can build up

concerta,I take 18 mg Concerta and I’ve been on that dose for a month.  This month she upped my dose to 1  18mg x2 a day.  I felt like it was wearing off really early leaving me feeling a bit scattered in the early afternoon.  So I will be taking the other 18 mg around lunch time.  Don’t expect anything huge as far as a feeling with 18mg.  It’s really subtle and easy going.  It’s not like a amped up feeling like most drugs for ADHD Atleast not a 18 mg.  That’s just my opinion because I’ve taken others like Vyvanse and Adderall.   Concerta is different in the way it releases in your body.  So just be patient and keep a journal of how you’re feeling and be sure to stay hydrated and report any concerns with your doctor.  Good luck!!,i take  mg concerta and ive been on that dose for a month  this month she upped my dose to   mg x a day  i felt like it was wearing off really early leaving me feeling a bit scattered in the early afternoon  so i will be taking the other  mg around lunch time  dont expect anything huge as far as a feeling with mg  its really subtle and easy going  its not like a amped up feeling like most drugs for adhd atleast not a  mg  thats just my opinion because ive taken others like vyvanse and adderall   concerta is different in the way it releases in your body  so just be patient and keep a journal of how youre feeling and be sure to stay hydrated and report any concerns with your doctor  good luck,[]

concerta,"By 18 mg i wouldn’t be concerned. I recently started with 27 mg and it doesnt feel like much, i just feel calm. It can increase your hertbeat a little but its very normal. And my brain feels just silent for the very First time in my life. If your anxiety is induced by your ADHD then you may also feel a little less anxious. I am, but it’s not completely gone. It made me also a bit sleepy and a little brain fog but it gets better as your body gets used to the medication. The thing is also you have to find the right dosage for you which may be tricky,  most people start with 18 or 27 mg and increase the dosage gradually. I would recommend that you take notes about how you feel so that you have something to talk with your psychiatrist the next time.",by  mg i wouldnt be concerned i recently started with  mg and it doesnt feel like much i just feel calm it can increase your hertbeat a little but its very normal and my brain feels just silent for the very first time in my life if your anxiety is induced by your adhd then you may also feel a little less anxious i am but its not completely gone it made me also a bit sleepy and a little brain fog but it gets better as your body gets used to the medication the thing is also you have to find the right dosage for you which may be tricky  most people start with  or  mg and increase the dosage gradually i would recommend that you take notes about how you feel so that you have something to talk with your psychiatrist the next time,[]
concerta,"I totrated from 18mg to 54mg which I'm staying on. One thing I'd say is be patient it takes a while to get used to although you may not feel much from 18mg but trust the process and work your way to your optimal dose slowly they start u off slow for a reason. I rushed when I was on elvanse and lost 2 stone and got severely depressed hence I switched to concerta which I find gentle and less of a hit when I take it and less of a come down. 

That being said u may crash its normal, so work with it and take some downtime around that time of day ie don't give yourself loads to do when u need to rest. 

I found it took a month for the tiredness to subside... it hit me hard on the first day of 18mg I had to go nap but like I say give it time side effects do settle its hard when u have adhd as your impatient but it's certainly a journey. 

Make sure you eat even if your not hungry. 

Concerta made me really agitated in the first few weeks again that's settled but I've also learnt medication is only half the battle you need to do the work for it to help ie plan your day the night before, don't be hard on yourself, eat, drink water even if you don't want to. Allocate self care time ie a bath and time to rest 

Obviously and I'm sure this won't happen but if you have serious side effects call your doctor- listen to your body and i have found now that I don't feel medicated like I did at the start so things ARE settling down
