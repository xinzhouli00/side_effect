qelbree,"Tapering off qelbree. Advice?  My doc put me on super low dose strattera to help taper off qelbree. It worked perfectly. 

I was on 200mg qelbree and started taking that every other day and 18mg strattera the other days. Then after a couple weeks I stretched it to two strattera then 1 qelbree. And when that was ok I went 3 days then forgot I had 1 qelbree left and took it last night. Basically tapered over a full month plus a bit. No problems at all. 

My ins never covered it and they majorly changed the coupon so it’s useless for people without insurance now unless they have $200/month laying around.","tapering off qelbree advice  my doc put me on super low dose strattera to help taper off qelbree it worked perfectly

qelbree,"Tapering off qelbree. Advice?  I tapered off of 100s over a month by opening the capsules and doing my best to divide the little dots into half and quarters.  I had a low grade migraine 2 days after taking my last dose of the quarter amount.  It only lasted about a half day.
Before tapering off though, I found that taking a Nurtec (a prescribed migraine medication) really helped.","tapering off qelbree advice  i tapered off of s over a month by opening the capsules and doing my best to divide the little dots into half and quarters  i had a low grade migraine  days after taking my last dose of the quarter amount  it only lasted about a half day

qelbree,"Qelbree and caffeine? Before starting any meds, I normally consumed half a pot of richly brewed coffee a day with no ill consequences. 

When I first started on Qelbree, I was having manic episodes (absolutely not normal for me) and severe insomnia for the first two weeks.  After reading about the caffeine interaction, I cut out coffee entirely and those side effects went away and I was able to sleep through the night again. 

Remarkably I had no withdrawal issues from cold turkey-ing caffeine either. 

I'll have a small cup of coffee on the weekend now, 3 months later, because I love it so much, but I can tell I shouldn't drink more as my heartbeat gets irregular. 

From what I've read your ability to process caffeine and melatonin slows down to about 25% of normal depending on the individual.","qelbree and caffeine before starting any meds i normally consumed half a pot of richly brewed coffee a day with no ill consequences

qelbree,"Qelbree and caffeine? It slows down your bodies ability to process caffeine. Significantly. So a coffee in the afternoon and you’re basically fucked for sleep lol. I used it as a chance to significantly reduce my coffee intake and will work to probably do decaf or none in the foreseeable future. I used to have 2 coffees a day and now I have 1 but I also don’t feel the need for the coffee as I can control my focus much better on this med.

qelbree,"Is anyone having a good experience? I made sure to share my somewhat positive post yesterday in this subreddit. I've only been on it for a few days at 200mg but I'm noticing some positive effects. Context, I also haven't tried true stimulants before, so having any actual ADHD treatment feels wonderful. 

Upping 200mg every 5 days feels like an extremely quick timeline, and from my understanding 600mg is the max dosage. Drugs.com says ""Dosage may be titrated in increments of 200 mg weekly to the maximum recommended dosage of 600 mg once daily, **depending on response and tolerability.**"". I know I sure wouldn't be able to say how I'm feeling until the side effects go away and I feel stable for a week. 

One thing to note is that qelbree is considered a non-stimulant because it is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, and doesn't manipulate dopamine like stimulants might. It should be treated more like an antidepressant than a stimulant, and you will get some nasty side effects if you suddenly change dosage or stop taking it. That's probably why your doctor said it needs to ""build up in your system"", although the half life is only 7 hours. 

Personally I'm upset your doctor didn't seem to do their research or inform you better... But that also seems to be the theme since it is a newer drug.","is anyone having a good experience i made sure to share my somewhat positive post yesterday in this subreddit ive only been on it for a few days at mg but im noticing some positive effects context i also havent tried true stimulants before so having any actual adhd treatment feels wonderful

qelbree,"Qelbree destroyed a month of my life My doctor is actually my psychiatrist. Is that more precise for you?

My discouraging people to use Qelbree isn’t based on the side effects of the drug but based upon the side effects of withdrawal, which make it impossible to discontinue it immediately once it becomes clear that it’s an issue.

qelbree,"Constant feeling of being on edge/ anxiety/ depressive thoughts Coming from a person with lifelong anxiety, and recent chronic GI issues and mental health diagnosis:

I get the impression that it may be more helpful to treat your anxiety/depression before your ADHD. It sounds like you're having a lot of intense symptoms that need to be taken seriously, and ADHD meds will often aggravate anxiety. 

I've also learned a lot through therapy: breathing exercises, prioritizing my most critical needs and finding accommodations, reframing my thoughts. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is where most people start, but trying different styles of therapy was helpful for me. Internal Family Systems is a newly popular one that I tried, I like the idea of it but not sure about my actual therapist. Trying multiple therapists until you genuinely feel comfortable is important IMO. 

Last recommendation is to look into short term disability if you have access to it through work. It's been extremely helpful for me to focus on my health without any extra stress.

qelbree,"Just Took My First Ever Dose Of Qelbree  This isn’t like stimulants for ADHD where you’re necessary going to “feel it” it’s more like an antidepressant where once the medication levels off in your bloodstream is when you get the full effects. That being said SNRI’s do have a slight “stimulating” feel when I first take them. It happened with this and when I used to take Cymbalta for major depressive disorder. That effect goes away after I adjust to the medication though. 

Also for side effects, just a slight headache the first few weeks. Dry mouth that has improved over the time I’ve been on it (3 months or so). There was that slight “stimulant” effect that wore off after a week or so.

Also, for me, the interaction with caffeine seems to have gone away. I can drink coffee/energy drinks and they affect me the same as they always have.

I’ve also missed doses and never had any of the migraines or sever withdrawal symptoms some people seem to have. 

Good luck!

Edit: Forgot to add how well it works! lol so I’ve been on every kind of ADHD medication they make. I haven’t tried one since I gave up around 2002 when straterra didn’t work for me and I can no longer handle the side effects of long term stimulant use.

qelbree,"Med Combos? I had a weird and interesting experience with Adderall and Qelbree. 

I took Qelbree for the first time ever yesterday and immediately noticed some benefits. People have been saying it takes a few weeks to feel anything but I immediately noticed a difference although small, but it came with side effects.

The biggest issue was insomnia like others. Feelings of restlessness and discomfort staying still, dry lips and a bit of nausea.

Anyhow the insomnia was so bad I was up till 7am unable to get any ounce of sleep tossing and turning. It felt like my body was unable to relax because of the meds. Anyhow I decided I would take some Adderall from a prior prescription because I needed to get to work since it was already morning. The plan was to power through until the night since I was still unable to fall asleep.

After taking the Adderall what was weird was I felt more relaxed, so I tried to take a quick nap. I ended up sleeping for an hour and it was a very relaxing sleep, one of the best I’ve ever had. 

I was also very surprised I could fall asleep on Adderall because I normally would be wired and unable to do so. Furthermore after taking the Adderall my constipation seemed to almost fade. 

Idk the science behind the two drug interactions but my layman guess is it has to do with the added dopamine from Adderall which Qelbree doesn’t actually provide as it only regulates norepinephrine and serotonin. 

But taking Adderall seemed to lessen the side effects of Qelbree. 

Given it’s only been one day though I feel like there’s not enough data and I might test this further. But I will say that I did feel a very rapid change after taking the Adderall, feeling more relaxed and less anxiety while on Qelbree alone I felt very tense and heightened anxiety. 

Maybe this is only an isolated one time thing but if I find out more I will make a separate post about this.","med combos i had a weird and interesting experience with adderall and qelbree 

i took qelbree for the first time ever yesterday and immediately noticed some benefits people have been saying it takes a few weeks to feel anything but i immediately noticed a difference although small but it came with side effects

the biggest issue was insomnia like others feelings of restlessness and discomfort staying still dry lips and a bit of nausea

anyhow the insomnia was so bad i was up till am unable to get any ounce of sleep tossing and turning it felt like my body was unable to relax because of the meds anyhow i decided i would take some adderall from a prior prescription because i needed to get to work since it was already morning the plan was to power through until the night since i was still unable to fall asleep

after taking the adderall what was weird was i felt more relaxed so i tried to take a quick nap i ended up sleeping for an hour and it was a very relaxing sleep one of the best ive ever had 

i was also very surprised i could fall asleep on adderall because i normally would be wired and unable to do so furthermore after taking the adderall my constipation seemed to almost fade 

idk the science behind the two drug interactions but my layman guess is it has to do with the added dopamine from adderall which qelbree doesnt actually provide as it only regulates norepinephrine and serotonin 

but taking adderall seemed to lessen the side effects of qelbree 

given its only been one day though i feel like theres not enough data and i might test this further but i will say that i did feel a very rapid change after taking the adderall feeling more relaxed and less anxiety while on qelbree alone i felt very tense and heightened anxiety

qelbree,"Switching from a Stimulant because of having OCD too… Yes. I started on Bupropion 150xl (it's an NDRI, but is similar in chemical composition to bathsalts, a synthetic stimulant) as a mild relief to my ADHD/ADD but only gave me dopamine while still easily getting distracted, potency is very low and gradual.

Now I'm off Bup and on qelbree 200mg for 2 weeks, I'm still metabolizing the Bup out of my system and Qelbree relieved a few of my symptoms slowly over the days.

qelbree,"Advice on switching from Qelbree 200mg to Strattera?  I am experiencing the insurance issues with Qelbree. I am so upset and angry! I tried other medications before Qelbree to no avail. I went through all the things with Qelbree. The nausea, vomiting, extreme fatigue, sleep issues because I was told to ‘hang in there and stick it out’ because it’s a good medicine. 
I finally got adjusted to 400mg and bamn insurance stopped. I had 3 Rx’s filled, this was my 4th. My insurance company never notified me and of course I was out. The insurance company wanted me to pay $652 for a 30 day supply. I was livid. After many phone calls, failed attempt at using the Qelbree coupon(my insurance denied it),and tears, I paid $152 for a 7 day supply. It’s insane to me that an insurance company has the power to decide my specific needs. INSANE! With zero notice. Another bullshit pharma move. 
No generic, you’re approved by insurance until you noticeably feel better, it’s a must take daily medication, and coming off of it is not easy. 

I’m weaning myself off of Qelbree. I went to 200 for a couple of days and now I am 5 days into 100mg. 

Tomorrow I meet with my psychiatrist-Telehealth- who I don’t think really gives a crap. It’s the same standard questions every time, followed by a dosage adjustment and see you next time. 
I’m going to tell her I’m done with all this BS. I’ve been working on my ADHD journey for many months. All this time, money, physical and mental toll to get to a point where I felt good! To be shot down by insurance and play games.

qelbree,"Teenage daughter, possible Mania? Hey! I can offer perspective from a 20 year old who was VERY similar when I was her age. Wild hormones and dramatic & over-the-top reactions to things are super common in teen years. It becomes problematic when it starts interfering with daily functioning (school, her friendships, sleep schedule, physical energy levels, eating, etc) for extended periods of time. If this is the case, my #1 recommendation is to get her a good physiatrist & therapist. The psych NP you’re seeing is likely trying their best, & may or may not be the right fit, just pay attention to those details. I’d also highly recommend starting therapy for yourself as well, dealing with a kid’s mental health issues can really take a toll and you deserve support too. I won’t lie to you, finding the right providers and meds is a lengthy and exhaustive process, listen to your daughter’s concerns & if she truly feels something isn’t right try something different. Take this with a grain of salt because there’s a chance your daughter is just facing normal teenage outbursts.

qelbree,"Lack of motivation Hi I’ve been on Qelbree for 2 years now. In my experience it does take a while like a month to build up and take affect. Each time I’ve increased my dose it take weeks and weeks to notice a difference. 

I am experiencing lack of motivation lately but have contributed it to my peri-menopause hormones (lack of estrogen) and hadn’t thought about the medication.

For the most part Q helps me finish things and go the distance to get stuff down, but I do still struggle at work at the desk with all the tasks and have to push myself to organize and strategize to get stuff down. . 

But also, with my adhd before Q I was hyperactive and driven by a motor all the time so I was used to a huge natural push forward to go, be, do and build. So it was chaotic but I was productive. (Maybe not in the right areas or on the right priorities though lol)

The meds calm our minds down.

qelbree,"Weekends off Qelbree Unfortunately this isn't really that kind of medication - Adderall wears off at the end of the day and tolerance breaks over the weekend are even encouraged, Qelbree builds up in your system over time to work. You've only been on it again for a week, so I wouldn't look at the one weekend as indicative of how it'll always be as not much has built up in your system.

Fwiw, I started feeling like ""myself"" again about a month in, just less scattered. If you need to feel a bit scattered to feel like yourself, this may not be the right medication for you","weekends off qelbree unfortunately this isnt really that kind of medication   adderall wears off at the end of the day and tolerance breaks over the weekend are even encouraged qelbree builds up in your system over time to work youve only been on it again for a week so i wouldnt look at the one weekend as indicative of how itll always be as not much has built up in your system

qelbree,"Weekends off Qelbree This drug increases norepinephrine levels in your body. One effect of norepinephrine is to constrict your blood vessels, including the ones supplying blood to your heart.

Stimulants do this too, but they have been studied for safety in the ways that they are used. Qelbree has not been studied for safety when frequently stopped and started, so it's safety when used in this way is not know.","weekends off qelbree this drug increases norepinephrine levels in your body one effect of norepinephrine is to constrict your blood vessels including the ones supplying blood to your heart
