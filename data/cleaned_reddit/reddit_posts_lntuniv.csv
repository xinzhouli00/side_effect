lntuniv,"Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience? I've had an overall very positive experience with guanfacine. It took about a month for me to notice any changes in focus and motivation, but now its completely changed my abilty to get things done. I used to procrastinate endlessly, now I can break projects down.

I've been on for over a year and it hasn't had a noticeable impact on my libido. It has definitely helped my anxiety, in similar ways to what you described in your update.

Highly recommend taking it about an hour before bed if you don't already, it helps me sleep at night and I still get all the benefits of the extended release the next day.","adult guanfacine erintuniv experience ive had an overall very positive experience with guanfacine it took about a month for me to notice any changes in focus and motivation but now its completely changed my abilty to get things done i used to procrastinate endlessly now i can break projects down

lntuniv,"Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience? I personally had a negative experience with guanfacine for a few reasons. It can lower your blood pressure, and for me that made me EXTREMELY tired and dropped my BP into the 40s at some points. Its impulse control methodology basically makes your reward pathways less responsive, and for me that made me extremely unmotivated and depressed in a way I had never felt before. I took guanfacine for two months & am diagnosed with ADHD and PTSD for reference. I thought maybe these side effects would go away with time, so I took all the pills prescribed to me. As soon as I got off them I started to feel better and got back on Adderall. 
There are some people on Reddit with positive experiences, including people who couple guanfacine with stimulants! :] I hope it is a better experience for you, and if not then I hope hearing my experience makes you feel less alone. My doctor did not go into the details on side effects for me so I was pretty blindsided by it.","adult guanfacine erintuniv experience i personally had a negative experience with guanfacine for a few reasons it can lower your blood pressure and for me that made me extremely tired and dropped my bp into the s at some points its impulse control methodology basically makes your reward pathways less responsive and for me that made me extremely unmotivated and depressed in a way i had never felt before i took guanfacine for two months  am diagnosed with adhd and ptsd for reference i thought maybe these side effects would go away with time so i took all the pills prescribed to me as soon as i got off them i started to feel better and got back on adderall

lntuniv,"Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience? My psych prescribed 1mg for a week then 2mg the second weak onwards.

lntuniv,"Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience? Around a year ago, I took Tenex ( instant release ) at .5mg (was given 1mg but I halved them) with dextroamphetamine 3 times daily. I would then take 1mg 1 hour before bed.   


At time time I was trying many anti depressants as my depression was worsening, and I wanted a low does during the day because I didn't want any of those 2-4% side effects I had read about.   


However within a month even at that low dose, I think it really helped, sadly I had to stop taking it because of some interactions with an antidepressant I tried, and I just now am attempting to resume use.   
I had no luck with antidepressants, but eventually tried ECT, and it was vey successful, so the first thing I am going to try is ER at night with my current ADHD medicine (Lisdexamfetamine)  


I will also be trying my IR routine, with 3 a day dextroamphetamine to see how it works after ECT, as before I think depression really stiffened of the benefits that Guanfacine gave to aid in the fight against ADHD.   


I will update what I find out, but I can say, I would of absolutely lost my job at once point if not for the combination, I ultimately lost my job on a ""leave to deal with insomnia from the worsening depression"" because I didnt check my snail mail. (Walmart.. yeah Ill rat them out)  


However, that was a blessing in disguise, because while it took nearly a year, I do not believe I would of been able to afford ECT without state funded healthcare. I am very optimistic about my future now, including the potential benefits of Guanfacine now that it doesn't have to fight the anxiety and nervous ticks of my depression.  


TLDR, Guanfacine is worth trying, even if it doesn't work for you, just titrate off of it slowly as it has some pretty crazy side effects even if you don't think it's working, oh look something shiny.","adult guanfacine erintuniv experience around a year ago i took tenex  instant release  at mg was given mg but i halved them with dextroamphetamine  times daily i would then take mg  hour before bed

lntuniv,"Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience? My doctor started me off at 2mg right away so I got hit with the low heart rate, tiredness, and dizziness right away. It wasn't quite as bad as what you're experiencing though.

I'd say watch your heart rate if you can and try to drink a lot of water and caffeine to help while your body adjusts. I also found that b12 supliments helped.

I'm breaking out now but it's more along with my cycle as usual and I don't know that these meds affected that.

It did take about 3 weeks for the tiredness to go away.

This drug does wonders for emotial regulation more than anything else, I've not gotten into a depressive state since I started taking it which is something that happened often before. I also feel like I'm less under water with this. It doesn't really help with motivation but it does help me not get distracted by nagging thoughts and feelings.

If you can push through the tiredness I think the end result is pretty good.

I've had two instances of emotional upheaval in the past week that normally would have sent me to a very dark place but on this drug I'm able to acknowledge that bad things happened and deal with it rather than crying in my room for a week with a tub of ice cream.","adult guanfacine erintuniv experience my doctor started me off at mg right away so i got hit with the low heart rate tiredness and dizziness right away it wasnt quite as bad as what youre experiencing though

I think because my diet is pretty bad in terms of not eating enough that it’s probably making things a lot worse.
Last night I only took 1mg instead of 2mg and today although I still feel pretty weak it’s way less extreme than it’s been.

My heart rate is usually quite high so it’s been in the low 60s to 70s now with the occasional dip below 60. I check my blood pressure once a week too.

lntuniv,"Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience? I saw a post from you from a few months ago where you gave quite a praise to guanfacine. I'm really curious if you think that was placebo, or if the effects were truly there but waned (extra curious about the perfect pitch). Could it be that you titrated too quickly? It seems that there is little agreement among doctors as to what the dosages and titration schedules should be (a natural consequence of the lack of FDA approval for adults, I guess). I'm wondering if it takes longer to build cumulative effects than people realize and titrating too quickly results in good effects at first, but then the dose becomes overwhelming.

I'm on 3mg myself at the moment, titrated from 1 and 2 over the course of 3 weeks. Had a very good effect at 1mg that disappeared, but I think it's coming back at higher doses (I'm now second-guessing whether I'm just starting to feel the cumulative effect). For now, it actually seems to help with the gym, I set a couple of PRs on it already and feel more energized.

lntuniv,"Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience? Yes!

So I'm not feeling as tired anymore, that sort of subsided. My heart rate still drops pretty low at times (low 40's) but I guess my body is getting used to it because it doesn't make me as sleepy as it did before.

I do take some b12 and drink tea but I have a history of deficiency with b12 and I don't drink tea excessively. I'm really not great at drinking enough water and I really need to work on it.

As for positives it's taken my doom spirals away, I had an upset two nights ago. Something like that in the past would have put me in a very dark space for at least a few days but I was able to pull myself together and leave it behind. It feels weird in a way like it wasn't hard to move past it at all so it almost doesn't feel like a triumph even though it really really is, it just felt, natural.

I don't have as much task avoidance but I still do struggle with it. I'm going to see about starting on Concerta again to add a stimulant to it, Concerta had made me depressed within 3 days of starting it and even though I could get stuff done it wasn't worth it. I'm thinking if the intuniv helps with the doom spirals so much it might counteract the depression the Concerta sets in.

The thing I was most worried about was lessening of feelings/emotions because people talk about that a lot. I think it's misleading, because I still have all of my feelings but they are no longer distracting me. I don't get sad or annoyed or excited or turned on so much that I can't focus on anything else. Those feelings are still there it's just that I can control them rather than letting them control me.

I see my doctor next week so I'll talk with her about the Concerta and my heart rate but it's going pretty well. It's not a miracle drug but it does help.","adult guanfacine erintuniv experience yes

I started 1mg last Tuesday 3/26 at 8PM for the first time in my life. I knocked out to sleep within the first 20 minutes of my 1st dose. The best nights of sleep I’ve had in months.

Wednesday morning, I woke up without brain fog. I was rather mellow. No physical anxiety symptoms. I still had a panic attack and melted down later that evening due to a trigger. .

Thursday morning, I woke up without brain fog. I was rather mellow.  No physical anxiety symptoms. I had a meltdown due to another trigger. It was resolved within an hr when it typically takes hours.

Friday morning, I woke up without brain fog. I was rather mellow.  No physical anxiety symptoms. I was able to think logically due to the racing thoughts stopping. I was able to manage another trigger well enough to prevent a meltdown or panic attack. It was a good day.

This morning, I woke up without brain fog. I’m rather mellow.  No physical anxiety symptoms. I was able to clean my bedroom for the first time in over a month. I can stay still while I’m typing this to you. It’s a good day. :)

I was instructed to take it at bedtime but asked if I could take it in the morning because I am not reliable with consistently taking meds at night. I was told I could so long as it doesn’t make me drowsy or fatigued. Guanfacine ER helps with my emotional dysregulation/rejection sensitivity which is what I was hoping for when trying it.

lntuniv,"Tried guanfacine (Intuniv)? Please tell me what you think Cross commenting this here for anyone looking for info. I believe it answers the questions you asked as well :) 

I’ve been taking this med, 1mg, every night for the past four days, and let me tell you, it has been a complete game changer for me! It’s amazing how quickly I’ve seen results—sometimes I have to check in with myself to make sure I’m not just imagining the changes 🤣. The difference has been incredible! I have had 0 side effects at all, no drowsiness, no sexual side effect, no blood pressure issues. I guess in that sense, I’m lucky, as I’ve seen quite a few people who have had not so great side effects.

Over the weekend, I accomplished so much more than I ever thought possible. I actually did things like used a dish and put it right in the dishwasher, or washed it—what a concept! I got out of bed, made it, brushed my teeth without a second thought, and even tossed my clothes directly into the hamper instead of letting them pile on the floor. I found myself tidying up everywhere I went, and I even washed my car!

It might sound a little over the top, but I promise, I’m not a messy person; it’s just that I’ve always struggled to push myself to tackle tasks I didn’t enjoy. This medication has really flipped a switch in my brain, and now those thoughts don’t even cross my mind anymore. It’s not like oh I’m excited to pick up after myself or excited to wash the car, shit even leaving the house for mundane tasks became an extreme effort. Instead of being excited, or putting things off, I just….did them. I knew I wanted to wash clothes, or didn’t want dishes in the sink, so I just did it.

Honestly, I never expected this kind of impact from the medication, and I wish I’d discovered it 20 years ago! The only other medication I take is Adderall 15mg, which I’ve used since childhood, but this new one has blown it out of the water when it comes to helping with executive dysfunction. I can’t wait to see how this week at work goes!","tried guanfacine intuniv please tell me what you think cross commenting this here for anyone looking for info i believe it answers the questions you asked as well

lntuniv,"Tried guanfacine (Intuniv)? Please tell me what you think Hi there! 

Sorry for the delay on an update, I’m still taking it and it’s still doing wonders for me. 

Alrighty, I’m currently bumped up to 3mg. The fog is definitely gone at this point. Instead of perhaps 4-6 fleeting thoughts or movements at a time, it’s gone down to 1-2 fleeting thoughts and movements. I don’t think it will fully go away, which is fine. I like that part of my personality. 

I’m not stoic, nor robotic. I’m still myself, bubbly personality & slightly squirrely. I can think clearly enough to notice what’s occurring with physical and mental symptoms of anxiety to help problem solve. The overwhelming ADHD overstimulation has reduced, it takes a lot to overwhelm me. (If my needs are met, no vulnerability) I still will not feel well if I haven’t gotten a good nights sleep or eaten. 

It’s something I would recommend. It may be a combination of all of the medication, such as Wellbutrin. I may bump to 4mg if I find work focus getting difficult. It’s typically taken at night, and will knock you to sleep within a half hour. Which is great, helps with evening anxiety.","tried guanfacine intuniv please tell me what you think hi there

lntuniv,"Tried guanfacine (Intuniv)? Please tell me what you think Thank you for this update. I am on Vyvanse 30mg and feel like I might want to try this or Wellbutrin in conjunction next. Not sure why I am always so hesitant to try things, maybe because both Wellbutrin and guanfacine stay in your system and have to be taken every day? I don't exactly know what I'm worried about but it's nice to know that there are options other than increasing doses for stimulants, which I'm not sure I want to do.

  
The overwhelm and overstimulation issues are quite big for me still. And that sounds lovely about it helping a touch with fleeting thoughts.

lntuniv,"Guanfacine as an adult - what are your experiences? Update from me...

For the first time I got what others were talking about : a kind of clarity.  I don't really like that analogy because it doesn't help people with no experience of it...I get that now.

And that's not necessarily a good thing.

It's not clarity because there's no fog.  What it _is_ is my thoughts being changed from nervous, always-looking-over-their-shoulder, kind of like something like a meerkat might be, to a cold-focused-surety.  Like my thoughts have an iron core that I can grip, that has strength. More like an elephant that takes no crap - it doesn't recognise the meerkat.

The difference is between thoughts that always seem to be on the alert to be wrong, or for the next thing, or just ready for fight or flight versus concrete.

So why is it not a good thing?  Because it was fleeting.  About 1 hours worth after my first (1mg) dose, and hasn't reappeared since.  It gives me hope, and it's a feeling I _remember_ having, but decades ago.  It also reminds me how far away from that I actually am.

Going from 2mg to (hopefully) 4mg next week, so I'll update as and when.","guanfacine as an adult   what are your experiences update from me

lntuniv,"Guanfacine as an adult - what are your experiences? So it's been over a month - I'm now on 4mg/day.

I think it's getting better.  I think I prefer it to straight Vyvanse & top up stimulant.

__ But__ I think I'm an edge case, or at least not quite ordinary, even in non-normal circles.  I'm going to ask for another bump in Guanfacine dosage, and also a top up Dexamphetamine, albeit smaller than before.  I'm now noticing the Vyvanse crash more than before, and it seems to hit much harder too. At 7pm on the dot I could fall asleep every day.  Unfortunately I'm still at work then, and with a 100 mile drive home - that has caused a few extended naps in car parks.

I really notice when I'm not on meds now (forget to take them), so they must be doing more than before!  Plus when the 'crash' _does_ come it's actually helpful.  If I don't take my meds it feels like I sleep worse as my mind just _won't_ shut up and then I won't go to bed as it'll wake the wife with me tossing and turning, but if  not in bed then I end up doing something, anything, and then I'm distracted and don't notice time and it's 4am and I'm still not tired... 🤯🤌🫣🤷🤦","guanfacine as an adult   what are your experiences so its been over a month   im now on mgday

lntuniv,"Guanfacine as an adult - what are your experiences? I asked him xD 

(I'm seeing a psychiatrist btw, and doctors here can't prescribe it because Ireland's healthcare system is still stuck in medieval times apparently, doctors here are also severely under-trained to deal with ADHD, my psych told me he'd have patients that come in that never even got to try half the things I did because doctors refuse to prescribe them, which is a joke in itself - I'm fortunate to have a better GP than most)

Also like I mentioned, I couldn't sleep on any other medication.

Ritalin was fine, I didn't like the sharp start and stop feeling of it working or not. It's OK and it's super cheap.

Concerta xr gave me heart palpitations no matter the dose, wasn't a fun time, stopped very quickly.

Atomoxetine was OK, again sleep issues, and some other urinary issues too, it felt like there wasn't enough pressure for me to pee at a normal pace and Id pee slower because of it. I stopped because I didn't sleep properly for 2.5 months. 

I was getting irritable from lack of sleep etc. All of these things made me pull the plug. My GP prescribed me sleeping pills I said I'm not going to depend on sleeping medication because of Atomoxetine. (good thing I didn't, once I recovered from lack of sleep and read up on cognitive side effects of long-term use of sleeping pills I shit myself) 

Guanfacine sleep issues are different, yes I wake up more often than not, but, I'll fall back asleep more often than not. Long-term this isn't good because you/I need prolonged uninterrupted sleep. However, I still feel rested. So I'm hoping this goes away.

Vyvanse gave me no side effects besides sleep issues, what it does is help with establishing a solid baseline, it has a consistent effect, Ritalin and Concerta don't work like that. However, even on Vyvanse I still don't care to move regardless, it helps with some things. 

Such as I was able to finally start exercising regularly but work and video games were still a drag. I want to work or play games, but I've no appetite for them.

Guanfacine enhances stimulant effects (as a side note), it was the missing piece for me. (I read research on it and thought it was what I needed, and I was right) 

I can just work when I want or need to, I can play games when I want to, I can stop when I want to etc, I have got an easier time pulling thoughts out of my head especially in more cognitively challenging conversations, albeit this may be an autistic trait, I'm getting assessed for that too soon.

Having said that, and guanfacine sleep issues aside, it works better on its own than Vyvanse would on its own for me, however, I can take both and have great results from it (especially since that I'm on a low dose of Vyvanse and have no interest in taking more), minus the sleep issues from guanfacine as of now ofc. My insurance (which I pay for) covers the cost and I'm saving money regardless. 

The biggest thing about this combo is I feel the same, it's very subtle and works, I don't feel overconfident like I did on Atomoxetine or head over heels happy as I did or Ritalin before I'd crash.. 

Hope this answers your question more or less.","guanfacine as an adult   what are your experiences i asked him xd

lntuniv,"Guanfacine as an adult - what are your experiences? That's actually a lot harder to answer than I would like.  For any number of a dozen reasons either,  singly or combined, I'm rubbish at sleeping. Whether that's due to ADHD, work pressure, whatever, I rarely get more than between 3 and 4 and 1/2 hours sleep per night.

That makes your question much more difficult.  It's very possible that when I am feeling tired or sleepy, or my eyes want to close, that could be by natural as I'm not really getting enough sleep, it could be a a by-product of me not being on a second dose of stimulants per day, it could be be that the effectiveness of the medication in making me less anxious etc actually has the effect of of allowing me to be tired if that makes sense.

Long story short I think I am feeling more tired now when I am in meds, but I don't know if I can put it down to the Guanfacine. Although, when I remember, which is 30 to 60% of the time, I do try to take the Guanfacine at night, about 10pm, just in case.

On balance I think that I I'm choosing to act as though it does make me sleepy, because why not? It's actually a question I didn't ask at the time, although the thought did run through my head, which is is why shouldn't the standard practice be to take the Guanfacine  at night if it doesn't act like a stimulant?  Is there a mechanism that I don't know or wasn't explained to me?

Sorry my friend, I wish I could make it simpler it clearer, but at least with this but of brain-fart you may at least be able to set a benchmark for yourself.

Hope something in that ramble is useful to ya!

lntuniv,"Guanfacine as an adult - what are your experiences? That's the weird/annoying thing with Guanfacine, at least for me:. I kind of don't notice it.  It doesn't work like the normal stimulants for me.  It doesn't have the obvious up and down/ on and off effect.  I couldn't tell you that it's obvious if I have or haven't taken it.

lntuniv,"Adderall + Guanfacine = GOAT I’m super late to this thread, but I figured I’d let you know it gave me some hope today! I had a similar experience with Adderall on its own due to being an ultrarapid CYP2D6 metabolizer, i.e., my brain blows through 15-20mg of Adderall IR in 2 hours. The last few months have been absolute hell trying to find an alternative that plays nicely with my various psych and neuro meds. I also have daily migraines with chronic fatigue, depression, anxiety, and PTSD, so there’s a whole mess of stuff going on in there. Dexedrine worked for a short while and then did almost nothing, Vyvanse absolutely wrecked me (I suspect in part because the dose was too low), Ritalin and Focalin were unpredictable and awful, Strattera made my limbs tingle, and half a dose of Provigil put me to sleep for 1.5 days. Concerta actually did an ok job of slowing down my brain, but it did nothing at all for my fatigue, so I was basically laser focused on the inside of my eyelids all day.

It’s been hard not to give up hope. Switching back to Adderall has helped me get back to a mostly functional fatigue level, but the mood boost, improved working memory, focus, and clarity are gone. I’m starting guanfacine tonight. I’ve been nervous about it, but your post makes me feel more optimistic.

Second week I was on 2mg and kinda the same thing, just elevated a bit. But I was getting accustomed to it and not really getting sleepy - and the nightmares went away. Though my sleep was a little wonky still.    

Third week I bumped to 3mg and made it like five days before I went back down to 2 lol. I already had lower end blood pressure and 3 was making me feel like I was genuinely gonna pass out when I’d stand up. And my hands were getting tingly / numb. I was a little loopy on it, my mouth was insatiably dry, and I think it was more than I needed realistically.

lntuniv,"Adderall + Guanfacine = GOAT Thanks for asking! I haven’t really settled in yet, but there’s a definite improvement. It’s a million times easier to stay calm. My therapist put it into words really well: “You have time to regulate your emotions before you start trying to problem solve. Stopping activities has been somewhat easier, though it varies from day to day.

The only real issue I’m noticing is that my energy is unpredictable. I had to stop taking my insomnia med (Quviviq) because taking both before bed made me feel super sleepy all day, even with Adderall. I had a few good days after that, but I think my sleep being thrown off has slowly made the guanfacine less effective at managing my executive dysfunction. It’s hard to tell because fatigue + ExD usually manifests (for me) as “I’m too tired to move so I can do the thing” rather than “I’m just not getting up to do the thing” (also part of why I was diagnosed so late).

The other thing that makes it hard to tell is that Adderall can be hit or miss for me with ADHD symptoms and fatigue. The effects are variable enough that I’ll probably need a larger than usual sample size to determine what’s guanfacine and what’s just my body’s weird shit du jour + Adderall not doing its thing. It’s a bit of a crapshoot whether I’ll feel like a human or just I’m be to stay awake, and feel like most people feel after a long day. At least I’m calm and sleepy! I’ll probably also know more as I titrate up. I’m taking it slow because increasing from 1mg to 2mg made me suuuuper sleepy. I scaled back for now because I have a big weekend of work stuff, and I’m still calm and sleepy, but I don’t feel like I need to take a nap constantly. I’m going to try again next week, but I think I’ll take it earlier in the evening instead of at bedtime. I’m curious to hear if anyone else takes it at a different time. I’ve come across the odd mention here or there, but I haven’t found much detail.","adderall  guanfacine  goat thanks for asking i havent really settled in yet but theres a definite improvement its a million times easier to stay calm my therapist put it into words really well you have time to regulate your emotions before you start trying to problem solve stopping activities has been somewhat easier though it varies from day to day

the only real issue im noticing is that my energy is unpredictable i had to stop taking my insomnia med quviviq because taking both before bed made me feel super sleepy all day even with adderall i had a few good days after that but i think my sleep being thrown off has slowly made the guanfacine less effective at managing my executive dysfunction its hard to tell because fatigue  exd usually manifests for me as im too tired to move so i can do the thing rather than im just not getting up to do the thing also part of why i was diagnosed so late

the other thing that makes it hard to tell is that adderall can be hit or miss for me with adhd symptoms and fatigue the effects are variable enough that ill probably need a larger than usual sample size to determine whats guanfacine and whats just my bodys weird shit du jour  adderall not doing its thing its a bit of a crapshoot whether ill feel like a human or just im be to stay awake and feel like most people feel after a long day at least im calm and sleepy ill probably also know more as i titrate up im taking it slow because increasing from mg to mg made me suuuuper sleepy i scaled back for now because i have a big weekend of work stuff and im still calm and sleepy but i dont feel like i need to take a nap constantly im going to try again next week but i think ill take it earlier in the evening instead of at bedtime im curious to hear if anyone else takes it at a different time ive come across the odd mention here or there but i havent found much detail",[]

lntuniv,"Guanfacine for adults?? Cross posting this here in hopes it’s helpful. Found the thread while googling and I’m sure others will too :) 

I’ve been taking this med, 1mg, every night for the past four days, and let me tell you, it has been a complete game changer for me! It’s amazing how quickly I’ve seen results—sometimes I have to check in with myself to make sure I’m not just imagining the changes 🤣. The difference has been incredible! I have had 0 side effects at all, no drowsiness, no sexual side effect, no blood pressure issues. I guess in that sense, I’m lucky, as I’ve seen quite a few people who have had not so great side effects.

Over the weekend, I accomplished so much more than I ever thought possible. I actually did things like used a dish and put it right in the dishwasher, or washed it—what a concept! I got out of bed, made it, brushed my teeth without a second thought, and even tossed my clothes directly into the hamper instead of letting them pile on the floor. I found myself tidying up everywhere I went, and I even washed my car!

It might sound a little over the top, but I promise, I’m not a messy person; it’s just that I’ve always struggled to push myself to tackle tasks I didn’t enjoy. This medication has really flipped a switch in my brain, and now those thoughts don’t even cross my mind anymore. It’s not like oh I’m excited to pick up after myself or excited to wash the car, shit even leaving the house for mundane tasks became an extreme effort. Instead of being excited, or putting things off, I just….did them. I knew I wanted to wash clothes, or didn’t want dishes in the sink, so I just did it.

Honestly, I never expected this kind of impact from the medication, and I wish I’d discovered it 20 years ago! The only other medication I take is Adderall 15mg, which I’ve used since childhood, but this new one has blown it out of the water when it comes to helping with executive dysfunction. I can’t wait to see how this week at work goes!","guanfacine for adults cross posting this here in hopes its helpful found the thread while googling and im sure others will too

lntuniv,"Guanfacine for adults?? I was on guanfacine a few years ago when I was close to your age and in college. I didn't notice any difference until one day about 2-3 weeks after starting it, and I realized I was sitting down and consistently making quality progress on homework for hours. At that point in my life, I had never been prescribed controlled stimulants for ADHD, so guanfacine was the most helpful medication I'd ever been on.

The impact did trail off several months later, though, and I didn't ever feel the same symptom relief as those early days even after upping my dosage. I didn't have any negative health side effects whatsoever, so I hope that helps ease your health anxiety a bit.

lntuniv,"People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them My(39f) mother(Bipolar or bdp narcissist) snorted and shot up my medications when I was growing up. She'd make me fake intense symptoms to the doctor to get increases and tried to swap out the afternoon dose the school nurse got with fake ones. She got a police visit for that one. 

I was being medicated around 4 or 5 years old with Ritalin. But it was rare until I was in Jr high that I got my meds consistently. 

I ended up missing the near entirety of 5th and 6th grade due to my mother's mental health and drug problems. She'd make me stay home with her because she dropped out of school when she was in 6th or 7th grade herself and was jealous of the idea of me getting more than she did. 

Thankfully I moved in with my grandparents and got a routine for the first time in my life.

I now have a bachlors degree and own my own IT firm. Highest level of education or career success anyone in my family has had. 

I've got a lot of CPSTD due to my childhood. I feel guilt and disgust at times due to taking the maximum dosage of adhd meds allowed. I feel like I was tricked into needing them. I see a psychologist every three months and a therapist weekly for the last two years and I still can't shake this feeling I'm faking my ADHD. That I'm a drug addict for needing them. 

I've gone off adhd meds twice for a year or so and both times my life fell apart. Almost flunked out of college and the other time barely held on to my job/could function. 

Even on the maximum dosage (40mg adderal XR atm) I'm struggling with executive function most of the time. I have to get 8 hours of sleep, I have to workout, I have to not eat junk or I just become a mess. I live alone and have no real routine or structure which is a huge part of managing adhd. In my childhood, I never had clean hung up laundry or clean dishes. It was all just dealing with chaos one thing at a time. 

When I do get my kitchen clean, desk cleared, and laundry put up I feel like I can actually breath and think clearly. 

Anyways. Got off on a tangent.

lntuniv,"People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them Oddly enough, when I was in college... everyone and their dog was handing out Adderall for finals. I said no but I kind of regret that. I might have figured all of this out sooner. Lol I just have never been a person to take pills unless I absolutely need to. (Would have been nice to know that was a need to situation). 

However, people wanting to get high or be super focused will earn nothing but ire from me. I know that ADHD is different for everyone, but without my medication...i quite literally cannot function. I cannot get out of bed. I get overwhelmed and I can't do anything from my job to eat to taking care of myself. And some asshole.who just wants to feel high will ask to take that away from me?! No! Money or no money. People without ADHD really take for granted their ability to do simple tasks and just live life. So they can fuck off. 

If someone truly believes that they have ADHD and wants to try something before they go through the process of getting tested, then I'm usually cool with giving them 1 of my 5mg IR boosters I take mid day.

I don't have to keep my meds locked up but would if I had to. Your guanfacine thing is genius. Because for me, guanfacine is a booster I take at night to help me sleep and it really helps the Adderall work better. Real ADHD sufferers will understand why that stuff is so freaking gangster.

lntuniv,"People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them I'll give you two answers, one long and one short. 

Short answer is I have ADHD and it felt good.  

Long answer is, I have ADHD and it was often euphoric, gave me a good bit of energy, and allowed me to focus.  The focus is the most important part for me, with inattentive type.  

I know some people don't experience much euphoria when taking their normal dosage, but keep in mind I was taking WELL above and beyond the maximum therapeutic dose. It was also ""street"" adderall, and while it certainly looked exactly like a legit pill, I have no way of knowing if it was real. The average max is 40mg a day, with more severe cases requiring 60mg.  As far as I can tell with what reading I've done, 60mg is the hard cap.  No one will prescribe you more than that.  The amount I was taking was completely unsustainable.  It would likely have killed me eventually. (90-120mg a day)

Another question I get asked often, especially by people who don't have ADHD, is why didn't I just get diagnosed?  Well, I have ADHD.  Committing to appointments and long term planning is notoriously difficult for us.  I suspected I had ADHD since around 6th grade, but I also had a few other severe mental disorders during by pre-teen and teenage years.  Any symptoms I had that could be pinned on ADHD were easily masked by the severe depression and anxiety disorder.  

I was seeing a therapist when I 25 that would have diagnosed me and given me medication.  I told her about my history of crystal use, and despite how much I liked the euphoria, the main reason I used it is because it allowed me to focus.  I declined it, because I assumed that medication would be prohibitively expensive to someone who didn't have insurance and could barely afford the weekly therapy appointments as it was.  I am not ashamed to say that, especially compared to how much I was spending on street adderall, it would have been far less expensive than I thought.  I regret not getting diagnosed then, but it is what it is. 

I've been on my real medication for over a year now, and I haven't touched anything illicit in over two years.  I also don't drink much anymore and only use the grass a few times a week.  I also don't abuse my meds and have no desire to do so.","people asking for your adhd meds or even outright stealing them ill give you two answers one long and one short

lntuniv,"Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it. I share your frustration. I suffered through 31 years of intense, undiagnosed, untreated ADHD. Took that long to get a psych eval because I was raised by a religious fundie dad who thought psychiatrists are all quacks, psych meds are poison, and any kind of mental health condition short of schizophrenia was just an excuse for the behavior of weak, undisciplined, morally inferior people.

When I finally went to a doctor and got the diagnosis, it contextualized literal decades of embarrassment, shame, brain fog, social anxiety, and low self esteem (largely due to the fact that it took every ounce of my mental energy to complete basic daily tasks that my peers appeared to handle effortlessly.)

Now that I'm on medication, it's made a massive difference in my quality of life, BUT I've gone through four different prescribers in the past three years before landing on my current doctor, because apparently having a prescription for stimulants at the age of 33 automatically makes a lot of doctors and pharmacists assume that you're just an addict. I've had doctors grill me multiple times about my (mostly non-existant) recreational drug history, refuse to fill my prescription without me giving a drug test (despite the fact that I've done nothing that even appears to be suspicious), the last one tried to take me off of tge only medication that's ever made a difference in my symptoms, EVERY TIME I had an appointment with her. 

The last straw was when she decided to (without consulting or even informing me) only fill three weeks worth of my meds instead of a full month, causing me to run out of my medication halfway through a week-long family vacation in a different state, the last three days of which were spent in a miserable, incoherent fog. She failed to return my phone calls for two weeks, and when she finally did get back to me, she informed me that she ""thought that I wouldn't really need the full month's scrip, since I was on vacation"". She also tried to use the fact that I called her several times and left her a sharply-worded voicemail inquiring about why I hadn't received my full prescription, as evidence that I ""had a problem"" and shouldn't be on stimulants. 

Luckily I found a much better (and less ideologically motivated) prescriber after that, and things have been better, but fuck. There is SO MUCH ignorance and stigma around having this condition as an adult. Seems like more than half of people (including doctors) don't really believe that adult ADHD is even a legitimate condition.","having adhd feels embarrassing now because of the hype around it i share your frustration i suffered through  years of intense undiagnosed untreated adhd took that long to get a psych eval because i was raised by a religious fundie dad who thought psychiatrists are all quacks psych meds are poison and any kind of mental health condition short of schizophrenia was just an excuse for the behavior of weak undisciplined morally inferior people

lntuniv,"Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it. What about the people that grew up in an environment where mental health wasn’t really a thing? And it wasn’t until lurking subs like this one that they finally started to put the pieces together and ask questions and dig a little deeper to try and understand the disorder and in the process of doing so realizes they display almost all the symptoms and as a result decide to make an appointment for an evaluation to get a diagnosis because they’ve gone their whole life as unstable mess but convinced themselves that’s how everyone else was too and that, and that that was just how it is. I can definitely understand where your coming from though, but for some people if it weren’t for more awareness they might have never even considered that ADHD might affect them. I don’t have my diagnosis yet but I look forward to getting some help.

How many times do you need to walk into room and forget what you were going to do/ what you were doing.

lntuniv,"Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it. it's definitely tough because on one hand, the increase in visibility of first hand accounts of ADHD is what led me to start researching it myself. I went to therapy off and on through my life as well struggling a lot in school and spending plenty of time in the guidance counselors office and never once had the idea even been floated. And I had always had that common misconception that ADHD is something they diagnose kids with for behaving like little kids and not little adults. Seeing people talk about how it has affected their life outside of hyperactivity (and often excluding hyperactivity) really resonated with me and I can't overlook that it was a crucial step towards seeking a diagnosis and treatment. 

Anyway, on the other hand, it definitely has led to a lot of oversimplification of ADHD and its applicability to literally any behavior. I think I can understand the impulse to ascribe so much of your behavior to ADHD, because for me that discovery to diagnosis process was a near constant ""OH SO THATS WHY I."" so naturally you want to apply to to so many other traits. I don't think there's anything wrong with self examination and wondering how certain traits relate to ADHD. I think a lot of times people mistake caused by/symptom of for exacerbated by. And then on the internet there is a tendency to imply some kind of universality to your own experiences. Some may think to add the disclaimer that they are only talking about themselves, but I think a lot of people forget that step and go straight to their word as gospel. 

Personally, I would rather search for ADHD advice and see people with ADHD (wherever they are in the diagnosis process) talking about their experience, versus what is still far more common which is advice aimed at parents of ADHD children. as though the only impact of ADHD is on the people who have to deal with them, and not the person themselves, and that it only affects children.","having adhd feels embarrassing now because of the hype around it its definitely tough because on one hand the increase in visibility of first hand accounts of adhd is what led me to start researching it myself i went to therapy off and on through my life as well struggling a lot in school and spending plenty of time in the guidance counselors office and never once had the idea even been floated and i had always had that common misconception that adhd is something they diagnose kids with for behaving like little kids and not little adults seeing people talk about how it has affected their life outside of hyperactivity and often excluding hyperactivity really resonated with me and i cant overlook that it was a crucial step towards seeking a diagnosis and treatment

lntuniv,"Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it. I feel this hard. I think the problem is closely associated with amphetamine culture and abuse in Uni.

People think it’s a joke or don’t understand how we cognitively function different and can’t control our focus. It’s hard to understand how someone can view the world differently… and we just attach labels to ourselves to explain lapses in understanding. It’s like the tip of the iceberg - people see the tip and go “wow look how small that is” and laugh it off without looking in the water.

I had a guidance counselor who told me my good grades / test scores (1560 SAT / 36 ACT) were just because I was on medication and I wouldn’t make it in the real world. He then didn’t submit my test scores to my college. The perception that we are using drugs as some sort of performance enhancing drug to get an edge on everyone else is pretty common.

Also the misappropriation of ADHD casually (most cognitive disorders really) makes it worse. A rowdy kid who may just want attention or is out bursting is casually called ADHD. Or if friends can’t focus there’s a lot of “oh yeah I’m so adhd too”.

I find this a lot with my autoimmune disorder - and any experience in life. If people haven’t experienced it’s hard for them to conceptualize the full scope of the impact of these things. I’ll talk about my RA and the response is usually “oh yeah my hands totally get sore after a long day”.

That’s why having real discussion and compassion and openness with these things are so important.","having adhd feels embarrassing now because of the hype around it i feel this hard i think the problem is closely associated with amphetamine culture and abuse in uni

I think what a lot of people don’t understand is that ADHD was not something that was easily diagnosed for some of us back in the 80’s and 90’s because in the past, a lot of providers looked for the extreme symptoms.

I'm not being critical, I just observe that maybe you're panicking a bit with your situation?  Which is fair enough. ADHD is difficult! I just encourage you to try to be patient and kind with yourself (which is also difficult!) and with those around you, who probably don't/can't really understand what life can be like for you.

I take vyvanse 70mg and occasionally have to top up with 5-10mg of Dexedrine in the afternoon. I was lucky and hit on the right medicine for me straight away, but from what I understand, it can take time for different individuals to find the medication that works for them, so don't give up. Perhaps 20mg is to low a dose for your tolerance? Hopefully you can discuss and explore these possibilities with your Dr.

As far as tiktok goes, I would just ignore it and focus on more helpful ADHD related material. I strongly recommend checking out the [Hacking Your ADHD ](https://pca.st/podcast/fa829090-cc14-0137-1e16-0acc26574db2) podcast. Although I was medicated for 2 years, I don't think I really appreciated or accepted what it really means to have ADHD until I started listening. It's really great.

I appreciate the awareness of ADHD that is growing in many (anglophone, at least) countries, and that the TikTokers may have played a part in that. But the crassness of using and styling your ADHD as a vehicle for some kind of fame or money making is inauthentic, annoying, selfish, lacking in self awareness, creates unnecessary cynicism and generally becomes more and more counterproductive for people with ADHD.

My inattentive ADHD is mostly inattentive to myself because I'm the last to know. Im also autistic myself so yeah my ""self read"" is extremely low. 34 years old my ways of coping just broke after covid and having kids, I thought I was crazy.

And sure, the key is frequency, and I'm sure there's some faking it for attention. But it was an amazing starting point for me.

Saved up and went to a private psychiatrist, said its fucking obvious i have it and have always had it. Checked my school reports, talked to family etc.


Medical misogyny is incredibly real. Gatekeeping information is incredibly real. Communities of frustrated and lost people who just got diagnosed and are passionate about educating people are real. Self diagnosis is real-not watching 5 tiktoks and self diagnosing, but sparking the focus to do science backed research into credible sources, yes. That's valid self diagnosing. I knew by the time I went to the psychiatrist it didn't matter what he said, I had it. And treating myself like I did and using tools like I did actively helped me. And now it's official I hope meds can really help more too.


It's not that I haven't struggled. I really have. I've been to some incredibly dark places,frequently. I was actually quite comfortable suffering and directing the brunt of everything internally and at myself, but it's when I started to effect my kids that I sought help.

Fun fact:

A lot of this is due to COVID. During COVID, many barriers to access medication/forms of therapy were lifted in order to make remote access easier and more accommodating. So these companies popped up and started pushing pills, telling everyone they may have adhd for the smallest, dumbest reasons.

And now due to that and other reasons, theres a shortage of adderall. 

I was diagnosed at an extremely young age. Meds made me wanna kms and i did try in 4th grade. People now just say they have it because they watched a stupid tiktok designed to go viral, or they got curious and went to one of these virtual-meeting “psychs” capitalizing on loopholes who wanna push pills for $. 

If you want to know if you have adhd, go to a fucking real doctor. They will straight up TEST YOU. And any good psych doesnt wanna give you fucking schedule 2 drugs, so they’re not going to just let you slide in a lot of cases. 

People glamorize it. I have to take my embarrassing little task/goal whiteboard if i have guests and mute a billion reminders on my phone if im out and phone not on silent. I take twice as long as anyone to do anything.

Shit sucks.

Social media/phone use causes a mild form of ADHD but unlike the real thing, minimizing SM/phone use will make these symptoms go away.

However, I am not one to discount someone's lived experience if they don't have the funds, the time, or the executive function to obtain a diagnosis. 

Many women struggled for years not knowing they had ADHD because their symptoms don't match the stereotypical male symptoms. Folks vlogging about it on tiktok has created more conversation around it, which will hopefully lead to more research and more solutions for everyone. 

And just like with any trend, there's going to be moochers hopping on the bandwagon to gain followers or whatever. I think folks that truly struggle with ADHD scroll past those ones pretty quickly - they're usually not even accurate. 

For me at least, the trend has made it more comfortable for me to discuss it with others, including my employer (who's been awesome about it).

Like I feel like I'd be better off being single because my husband does so much for me and I don't have the energy to even put away the laundry he washes, or unload the dishwasher after he's loaded and ran it. At least if I was single, I wouldn't have to worry about him and how my need to disconnect from everything and shut down for an extended while would impact him.

Anyway, I definitely think I have inattentive ADHD, and I went in for a consult this past week and have an appointment with an actual psychiatrist at the end of August (3 months after my initial Convo with my PCP ...yay for the mental health system). While I was there I filled out a WURS, and after I turned it in, I looked up how it's scored. I'm 100% certain I will be diagnosed. I'm hoping meds will help me feel a little more centered and in control of my life... But I wouldn't have ever suspected ADHD if it hadn't been for the current hype.

... It is annoying though that my mom shrugs it off because I wasn't hyper (even though I've explained inattentive ADHD to her), and my coworker says ""all teachers have ADHD because we have to split our attention and make a thousand decisions a day"".. like no. You are not crippled by it. You don't need to take a nap some days before even attempting to drive home. You can go home and do things where I have 0 energy and can't accomplish even basic house cleaning during the school year. I'm 34 and can't imagine having kids because I can't even take care of myself. I can't wrap my head around how some people are teachers, parents and have time for a life or things like volunteering.

Long rant, but I hate posers of any type and am annoyed at all the people crying ADHD, but I sure am glad for the attention these videos are bringing because I'm definitely starting to understand myself better and I'm hopeful for medical help so I can have some peace of mind.","having adhd feels embarrassing now because of the hype around it i understand your frustrations but im glad for the videos i dont have tik tok but ive seen a few on fb i had  idea that inattentive adhd was a thing ive been feeling so overwhelmed especially lately because i cant adult im always running late i cant keep organized i forget about  of my meetings and deadlines yet i keep being given more responsibilities my anxiety and depression has been off the charts because i feel like i cant juggle everything and its ruining my life and making me feel like failure of a wife like i feel like id be better off being single because my husband does so much for me and i dont have the energy to even put away the laundry he washes or unload the dishwasher after hes loaded and ran it at least if i was single i wouldnt have to worry about him and how my need to disconnect from everything and shut down for an extended while would impact him

lntuniv,"Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it. I get how it can be annoying, but it's not exactly the tiktoks fault (even though it does seem like it).
Before the recent awareness of ADHD on social media, I wouldn't be diagnosed. I definitely wouldn't have accepted my other issues were comorbid Autism either. Heck, my mother was diagnosed back in the 80's and she still tried to deny it was true for herself or me because of the old stereotypes. The tiktoks shed light on the wide diversity of profiles, and that's why they end up being so diversified and more ""neutral/good"" leaning than showing the struggles. Nobody wants to think something is wrong with them, especially people who have been shit on their whole lives for their undiagnosed (or diagnosed) ADHD.

The research shows it's still underdiagnosed even given the recent surge. People just dont want to accept that this neurological condition is ACTUALLY a normal and common condition of the human experience ~ and so the uneducated blame tiktok for what is actually a long-standing combined ego+lack of research issue in Psychology. 
For sure it is hard to function as someone with ADHD (and other comorbid issues that are common for us)...but it gets easier as you gather knowledge and confidence.

I've been in that headspace where I was severely depressed, to the point of meltdowns because I felt useless and a burden to others. I was struggling with managing everything in life and even questioned if I should be pursuing my degree. The solution took a while to sort out mentally and logistically, but I just doubled down on accepting my ADHD and either negotiating or forcing (lol) others around me to accept ""IT IS WHAT IT IS"". It's not my fault if others try to enforce unrealistic expectations in face of me trying to communicate.

Also, just as an aside ~ At 20mg you are still actually under the ""therapeutic dose"". I take 30mg Vyvanse (when needed, mostly for Uni or housework) and that is considered the ""mimimum"" to actually be in any way effective lmao (I dont take more because I also have GAD and it exacerbates my sensory issues too much). I'd definitely double check with your doctor why they are still putting you at a low dose...usually they only do that to make sure the effect strength is desirable and not causing any weird side effects ~ NOT as a regular dose to treat executive dysfunction.

lntuniv,"Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it. I fucking feel the pain at others making light of your condition. While I haven't been diagnosed, my life has been riddled with occurrences that strongly lead me to believe I have autism, ADHD, or both, to a minor/moderate degree.

I've been mocked and laughed at by family for things I've said and done that I couldn't help doing/made sense to me.

That said, I agree, forgetting something every once in a while does not ADHD make. But as others have said, I would much rather have the hype so there's awareness than not.

It's worth recognizing that there are a number of causes of ADHD symptoms, and not having frontline meds (which both guanfacine and adderall are) work just means that you possibly have a different underlying mechanism for those symptoms, and thus need different meds.

lntuniv,"Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it. I had a late life diagnosis. Managed to muddle through life until menopause and then wham. Told my dr I thought I was developing dementia or something. I was worried about losing my job. Couldn’t remember meetings, couldn’t organize myself, couldn’t make myself do things that were boring but necessary. When I filled out all the questionnaires and answered all the questions in person, and the dr said yup, looks like ADHD, I was a bit flabbergasted. But a lot of things made more sense - my inability to keep friends as a kid, my never being able to do homework until the very last minute, all the things I started and never finished, getting into debt for very stupid things, so many things. 


Took awhile to figure out medication dose because when I felt like it wasn’t helping, I just stopped taking it and didn’t go back for a few months. Ritalin did nothing for me. Vyvanse at 20 and 40 mg- mostly nothing. I was chattier on 40- like just a bit more willing to have conversations , not talking off people’s ears. When I finally saw my dr many months later, the dr said I might need a higher dose. 60 mg was the magic for me. Holy cow did it make a difference. I’m still time-blind and forgetful. But it’s like whatever was getting in the way of being able to do the thing I need to do is gone. I had no idea how much anxiety was a problem until after finding the right med and dose. Felt like I had taken lorazepam rather than lisdexamphetamine. 

Anyhow. I get what you’re saying about all the hype. It’s like people glibly saying they are OCD about something. It minimizes the real struggle. At the same time, I kind of like seeing some of it because it helps to know I am not the only person who has problems.

lntuniv,"Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it. Hey, my ADHD specialist told me that you need to get actual restful sleep in order for most ADHD medications to work; i was on Adderall as well and only noticed benefits the first week before things came crumbling down again. He, after looking at my diagnosis for sleep apnea, asked me if I've been using my CPAP. When I said no(because of ADHD and OCD making it nearly impossible) he told me that's probably why the Adderall wasn't working.

Especially if you snore, I'd recommend seeing if you can have a sleep study done. If your brain can't do it's thing at night, Adderall (apparently) won't do it's thing during the day. And sleep apnea is literally not breathing, which means your brain gets less oxygen at night. Which is harmful for so many reasons.

This is also a big reminder that I have to schedule another auto study or figure out with my insurance how to get another CPAP machine.

People will so often just assume you're trying to be quirky...and, it sadly predates tiktok. I'll be 30 next year and people were saying ""haha I'm so adhd"" when I was in secondary school.

To be fair though my colleague did initially get ""diagnosed"" by me. My sister is autistic, my closest childhood friend was, one of our other colleagues is, and this guy was ringing all the bells and apparently his doctor agreed. So sometimes it helps to be talked to by non-professionals to get yourself to consider going.

lntuniv,"Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it. This is why I don’t really talk about mine very often. If someone asks me then I tell them but otherwise I keep it to myself. What’s happening with ADHD now is the same thing that happened with Anxiety and Depression in the late 90s and early 20s. It’s been sensationalized and because of that, everyone walks around saying they have it when most of them don’t. I think the reason for this is because pretty much all ADHD symptoms are things that everyone experiences from time to time; so people think they have it because they experienced hyper focusing or time blindness or executive distinction. What they don’t realize it that it’s the the consistency and duration of the symptoms that distinguishes between having ADHD and just having the odd symptom from time to time. Hopefully this will eventually balance out but my biggest concern is the amount of people that are being prescribed medication for it that they don’t actually need. It’s creating a pandemic of amphetamine addiction that we won’t be able to meet the medical treatment needs to correct. And instead of people dealing with the trauma that came from 3 years of Covid Quarantining and Social Distancing, they are all just getting put on incredibly dangerous medication that they don’t need in order to cope.",having adhd feels embarrassing now because of the hype around it this is why i dont really talk about mine very often if someone asks me then i tell them but otherwise i keep it to myself whats happening with adhd now is the same thing that happened with anxiety and depression in the late s and early s its been sensationalized and because of that everyone walks around saying they have it when most of them dont i think the reason for this is because pretty much all adhd symptoms are things that everyone experiences from time to time so people think they have it because they experienced hyper focusing or time blindness or executive distinction what they dont realize it that its the the consistency and duration of the symptoms that distinguishes between having adhd and just having the odd symptom from time to time hopefully this will eventually balance out but my biggest concern is the amount of people that are being prescribed medication for it that they dont actually need its creating a pandemic of amphetamine addiction that we wont be able to meet the medical treatment needs to correct and instead of people dealing with the trauma that came from  years of covid quarantining and social distancing they are all just getting put on incredibly dangerous medication that they dont need in order to cope,[]

Sometimes having this weird little brain disorder is fun because I can crochet super fast ALL FUCKING DAY and LOVE IT (I also learn new hobbies or skills fast with what feels like no effort and I absolutely love that about myself), but usually… and that means most of the time, it fucking sucks. I am sailing that ship with you. This is not a “quirky” disorder. It effects every facet of life, to the point that most things feel like they’re challenging the very essence of who I am. We have to fight against ourselves, constantly, to fit in and function in the society we exist in. With adhd, existing is exhausting - never mind everything else we have to do so that the culture were currently in, doesn’t turn against us. 

I just don’t tell anyone but those who are required to know. My doctor, my partner, my son. Otherwise, what’s the point? My medication is stigmatized. My existence is trivialized and questioned. I would be told that I make all the wrong choices in life that *thats* why I’m like this, not because of any kind of neurological mis…wiring in my mothers womb that I had no choice or say in whatsoever. 

Having adhd isn’t ever something to fucking **want**, but if you experience it… acceptance is where it’s at. Education on adhd. The trend of it all right now is like other have mentioned, a double edged sword. You have people who think it’s cool and will pretend to have it, for whatever reason their unconscious mind has chosen. It’s caused even more people to look at us with discontent - But with that negativity, comes more awareness and understanding from the outside as well. And a lot of it.

You should probably read ""So I'm not Lazy, Crazy, or Stupid?"" It might go a long way to feeling better about yourself. The beating yourself up is so counterproductive to progress, you can't even imagine. Learning to love myself, ADHD and all,  made everything so much easier.

Anything else is gravy."" Writing down your tasks also keep them from ruminating around your head.

lntuniv,"Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it. I was diagnosed late but pre-TikTok/adhd online virality, just barely. I wonder if there actually was a noticeable uptick in diagnosis, especially for adults, prior to a lot of this content taking off? Like maybe a movement within the mental health/medical community to look for symptoms in their adult patients? My doctor completely floored me by diagnosing adhd but we were dealing with years of anxiety and depression that meds couldn’t touch. ADHD made sense to her and now I cannot believe no dr before her ever saw it. My doctors now are like lol yeah obviously. 

It is frustrating to have it treated as a trend, but I do appreciate the broader understanding I get by seeing other ADHD folks’ experience. I think the weakness comes from the anecdotal “do you do this? That’s ADHD!” 2 people with ADHD can have 2 diametrically opposed personalities, habits, etc. ADHD doesn’t make you messy or super organized, always late or always early, forgetful or extremely precise. The ADHD makes the executive function and processing in your brain not work right. How you compensate, cope, or mask to deal with that deficiency is going to look different and sometimes completely opposite in different people. So it’s helpful to me to see people who aren’t the stereotypical adhd “personality” because that can be validating as someone who went undiagnosed for so long.  But from the outside, it definitely comes across as every quirk, habit, or outright normal behavior is a sign of adhd and that’s pretty frustrating when it’s used to undercut the validity of your diagnosis.","having adhd feels embarrassing now because of the hype around it i was diagnosed late but pre tiktokadhd online virality just barely i wonder if there actually was a noticeable uptick in diagnosis especially for adults prior to a lot of this content taking off like maybe a movement within the mental healthmedical community to look for symptoms in their adult patients my doctor completely floored me by diagnosing adhd but we were dealing with years of anxiety and depression that meds couldnt touch adhd made sense to her and now i cannot believe no dr before her ever saw it my doctors now are like lol yeah obviously

lntuniv,"Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it. I just wanna say that the journey to finding the right medication can be very long. There's no single right solution for anyone and everyone's bodies react differently to medication. 

When I was first diagnosed, I tried about 5 different ADHD stimulants. They all gave me horrible side effects and weren't always the most effective. I stopped taking medication for about 10 years because I didn't want to deal with it. Just recently started up again, and my current doctor recommended doing a Genomind test. It tests your DNA against a bunch of pharmaceuticals and will tell you if a drug is effective or not, if you're at high risk for side effects etc. It even checks to see if you metabolize drugs quickly. 

It was really eye opening for me, because it turns out, that all those stimulants I tried before, none of them were recommended for me based on the test. So now I'm on a regimen of 3 different non stims plus some supplements. With exercise and good diet, I'd say my ADHD is about 65% - 75% managed. It's still not great, but I'll take it. Highly recommended the test if you're able to do one!","having adhd feels embarrassing now because of the hype around it i just wanna say that the journey to finding the right medication can be very long theres no single right solution for anyone and everyones bodies react differently to medication

I'm in highschool and got recently diagnosed. On 10 grams of focalin. 

I'll miss school assignments, test dates, NAHS meetings, ARD dates. 

It's embarrassing to explain that I didn't bring the project because I forgot it was due when it's written on all three boards of the classroom in big red lettering

I've forgotten what class I was going to between class periods and gone to the wrong class during the SECOND semester. That's one of the most embarrassing moments of my life. ""You've had the same classes at the same times for 6 months and you're going to the wrong class?? What are you, stupid?"" 

I've experienced ADHD paralysis (or something similar) in the middle of assignments. Something about stopping in the middle of an AP chemistry quiz unable to move your hand to write as you turn the gears in your head to figure out this subject with so many other thoughts clogging up your mind doesn't seem very efficient. 

I've cried because I NEEDED to get up and walk around, to move, to do SOMETHING but I was too embarrassed and locked my joints to prevent me from getting up which only made me start crying. I just start tearing up in the middle of spanish class before being given permission to go to the nurse. (I didn't go, I just came back after stretching my legs) 

And in my opinion, the worst part for me personally when it comes to school (not including personal life, I'll get to that) is the fact that I cannot for the life of me remember formulas or times tables. It does not stick with me at all. And that makes my AP classes all the worse because we don't get formula charts or times tables or calculators. Geometry was a nightmare of cheating for formulas and begging for calculators (thank god my geometry teacher understood my issue after trying to teach me times tables in NINTH GRADE and failing) I could've done great on my own with those resources.

At home my mom is convinced im just lazy and constantly berates me for it. I can barely find and keep a hobby which upsets me greatly when I'm bored and nothing holds my attention. I'm an aspiring manga artist because im good at drawing that style but its hard to draw when I want to, much less when it's my job. 

And tasks are always complicated. If the instructions aren't clear and detailed I seem to ALWAYS do it wrong. People say I lack common sense when I just followed the directions given to me. 

""Hey, go wash the dishes in the sink""

""Why didn't you wash the dishes on the counter and stove?""

lntuniv,"Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it. the stigma surrounding ADHD and the general populations misunderstanding of it, and the way it is treated, is miserable. 

I know that the post is tagged as empathy/support, but I am curious - did you titrate up and then back down to 20mg adderall or did doc just stick you on that dose and call it a day? your descriptions of your prior interactions with him sound like a similar experience to what I went through. Titration should really be the first thing you and your doctor work with when trying to work out ADHD medication and dosage and if he didn't do a titration and you feel it isn't working, you might just literally not be taking enough. **it is very possible that you simply optimize on a much higher dose than what you are taking**. I think especially for hyperactivity symptoms, higher doses tend to work better than what is needed to manage inattentive symptoms. Every single person responds to every single medication a little differently though, so its worth talking to doc about starting to **titrate dosage up to see if it helps, if you didn't already go through that process.** 

on a different note - even though I am currently in a good place with managing my ADHD on the day to day, I still find that oftentimes what hurts the most is not having a place to feel comfortable being me in. I am very large - 6'1"" and 220lb - and 99% of people I have ever known have an automatic fear reaction when I am upset over everything. Even my partner gets mad because I scare her when I am upset. I have never hurt a fly. never hit another person. I have never been violent in my life. When I am angry or stressed or sad, I have a tendancy to stomp around, slam a few doors, yell ""FUCK"" etc. It isn't directed at anyone or anything - but it is sometimes an unconscious behavior and sometimes I don't want to act that way but struggle to control it. I get especially frustrated because when my 5'4"" 120lb partner is pissed off and slams doors, huffs and puffs, whatever, nobody gets scared. my/her parents will think its funny, ask whats wrong, say ""haha, someones having a bad day"" but if I behave the same way everyone locks themselves in their rooms or gets all scared and concerned as if I my behaviour indicates that I'm any more dangerous in that state than she is. I am not. I just need to be pissed sometimes?? apparently im not allowed to be though.  

It seriously sucks because I'm not hurting anyone and sometimes I just really need that? I can't be on my medication all the time and for whatever reason, shouting the f-word and slamming a few doors seems to me like a better way to cope with my problems than drinking/MJ, yelling at my wife, fighting with people, hurting others, falling into a depressive spiral, venting/self loathing, etc. but this behavior is disruptive and scary and as such, I am simply expected to be different. 

I feel this way with a lot of things. Sometimes I just really need to be loud, need to slam something down in frustration, need to talk without interruption even if the other person isn't really listening and just decides to smile and nod. but nobody is okay with this or wants to deal with it so it can be really hard to find an outlet. When managing my symptoms I don't want to ""be better"" for other people, i want to be better for myself, and for my behavior that isn't harmful to myself or others, I wish that I could simply be accepted for who I am. unfortunately most people aren't willing to create or deal with that kind of an environment. 

point in this being - the way that I cope with this part of my adhd is to find a place to be me. I am very fortunate to have found a medication and dosage (concerta 36mg) that I respond well to, and which allows me to be different and function a little better during the times when I need to function well. I think that maybe this would be the first step for you if you haven't already gone through strategies to do so with your doctor. However, medication is not an end all be all solution, and coping with the sometimes more embarrassing parts of ADHD is and was, for me at least, a matter of finding people and places where it's okay for me to behave in ways that would be ""embarrassing"" in other situations. 

**TL,DR;** sometimes, no matter how embarrassing, you have to be you. while I find that my medication, therapy, and other strategies are very useful tools in managing my symptoms, **no amount of medication or masking will provide the accepting and liberating experience of finding a person and a place where you can be you without needing to worry about your behavior for a little while.**","having adhd feels embarrassing now because of the hype around it the stigma surrounding adhd and the general populations misunderstanding of it and the way it is treated is miserable

You don’t need a crutch for that” — I’ll have to repeat his words now that he wears glasses) and another friend tries to sound sympathetic but when a simple mistake is made he goes to that with a bit of condescension in his words and tone. Or hell, maybe I really am just sensitive to it— which I am, but still.

I completely understand what you mean. I got diagnosed about a week ago (took about 6 months), in part thanks to seeing a ton of relatable tiktoks with #adhd at the bottom which made me realise I probably had adhd or autism (I started suspecting 1.5+ years ago). A lot of them were about things like ahdh paralysis/executive dysfunction, switching tasks midway through and not going back to finish the first one, constantly forgetting things,...
So there are some good contentcreators who help spread awareness.
That said: the ones that try to make adhd sound like a ""fun quirky thing"" can bugger off :).
There are definitely some positives imo such as having like infinite interests, pattern recognition,... But it's not all fun and games.","having adhd feels embarrassing now because of the hype around it im relatively new to adhd and stuff so sorry if i say anything incorrectinsensitive or anything like that

lntuniv,"Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it. It’s exhausting. I wasn’t diagnosed until my sophomore year of college (2020) and it feels like nobody respects that it’s actually something has significantly impacted me; other ADHDers act like I just hopped on a train and shopped for a diagnosis, while non-ADHD people think I’m so “lucky” because they ~swear!~ they have it too but they “for some reason” can’t get a diagnosis.
Growing up I tried to open up to my mom about how I was struggling; she got mad when I forgot things, or was late, or didn’t get perfect grades, but she wouldn’t acknowledge how I was struggling. When I was old enough to know what ADHD was and I understood that it was possible I had it (esp. considering 2/4 other people in my family do) I told her I wanted to be evaluated for it. She said there was no way I had it, because my father and older brother both have it and they “act completely differently.” Spoiler: it’s because they’re more hyperactive while I’m more inattentive, and people also just think women can’t have ADHD. 
I was only finally diagnosed when I had the freedom to seek out a psychiatrist on my own. I was seeing her for anxiety but after a few appointments of hearing my symptoms and knowing my family history, she was the one who brought up the possibility of ADHD. It was such a relief to finally be acknowledged. 
I just wish that the disregard people had for how it impacts me would have stopped there. Despite my diagnosis, my mom still swears there’s no way I could have it, and so many of my peers just don’t understand and totally trivialize it.

After my diagnosis, my psychiatrist and I discussed my paying for this saliva test that helps assess your specific chemistry when it comes to considering medications. The test doesn't diagnose you. But it gives your doc insights into what is likely to work if you're diagnosed with ADHD, depression, etc. If I hadn't done the test, I know my journey with medications would have been a lot more frustrating. 

I thought I'd mention it because I hear your frustration. I realize that meds aren't a magic bullet, but they have made a big difference when combined with the shit ton of other habits and tools I adopted before my diagnosis.

Was even sent to another ""ADHD Specialist"" in Norway and was told that as I had no symptoms as a child I could not be diagnosed.

lntuniv,"Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it. This is how I feel. Filler people eat up so much space for every subject, there's no avoiding it.  I'm grateful that so many ADHD and Autism tiktoks are sharing the real side. 

I'm officially diagnosed ADHD so I guess I'm allowed past the gate.

I'm late 40s, well educated, but never had an explanation for why I've struggled with *everything* my whole life (outside of good grades). It took having two kids who don't even present the same as me to look into it. If my oldest didn't have combination ADHD with the external hyperactivity I still think I'd be in the dark.

For my age, inattentive ADHD, especially in girls with good grades did not exist. ADHD and Autism were cartoonishly represented.

Just being able to give myself some grace instead of constant shame and self loathing is worth it. I still do, but maybe a little less and I don't let others knock me down as much. And more importantly I'm working on helping my kids understand themselves like I never had a chance to.

lntuniv,"Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it. This  is me too, but interesting that I see the TikTok memes as similar to my childhood mental-health denying environment it that they seem to trivialize it at something everyone has. So, the mental health denial I experienced was ""oh, that's just normal to not sleep (like from infancy)"" or ""everyone is different, you're just different"". Leading to a lifetime of coping, burnouts, breakdowns, meltdowns, chaos, etc. But wondering how people actually get sh\*t done. I mostly kept it together until I had a full time office job I've been like ""I have no clue how people manage to work and do ANYTHING else"". And, I'd say this to people who would respond by looking at me like I was from another planet as though it was possible or even ""easy"" to do this. I don't get this sense of actually seeing or describing the real impairments that come with ADHD. It was only once I started reading ACTUAL scientific descriptions of ADHD that it started to click, because I just don't identify with someone that ""loses their keys"" or whatever. That does not actually describe what is happening inside my messy, messy brain. So, yeah, the social media descriptions just have the same feel as ""oh that's just a normal thing, isn't that different"" that I got my whole life.

lntuniv,"Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it. It’s a mixture of both honestly. When I was younger (about 7 or 8) my mom had me tested and she found out I had ADD. She didn’t believe in using medication to treat it, and I was so young I really didn’t know anything better and just went with it. She told me when I was older she didn’t need medications so she never bothered to help me with it. She still believes that to this day anytime she brings up “how my meds are going” because she still thinks this is something I’ll just grow out of at 30 years old. 

My TikTok FYP doesn’t really get flooded with ADHD content. It’s not that much at all actually and I usually only see a few videos a day on it. However, the videos I do see are always centralized in the same concept of “Here three reasons why you might have ADHD” and they have no credentialing to support their data. They list highly mundane activities that are mostly normal to the average person, or are completely inaccurate in what they describe. For example, a lot of them will talk about how organized they are. Organization is great! Is that the primary reason someone has ADHD? Not at all. Being organized is important for people who do have ADHD in the sense that, like me, if I don’t make lists or keep myself organized for chores or daily activities, I’ll be lost and it’s impossible to get on track again. But just saying “I like being organized” doesn’t mean you have ADHD. Then you see the comments are all “wow I had no idea I had ADHD, I’ve been very organized my whole life” and this starts the trend of misinformation. 

This post wasn’t meant to attack people for spreading information. It’s the spread of misinformation from people who use their ADHD for clout, or are trying to use their platform to diagnose people who aren’t licensed to do so. And then it makes people who actually do struggle with ADHD come off as if their issue isn’t real. Specifically why I said my coworkers tell me I’m autistic and just laugh. It’s hurtful and aggravating.","having adhd feels embarrassing now because of the hype around it its a mixture of both honestly when i was younger about  or  my mom had me tested and she found out i had add she didnt believe in using medication to treat it and i was so young i really didnt know anything better and just went with it she told me when i was older she didnt need medications so she never bothered to help me with it she still believes that to this day anytime she brings up how my meds are going because she still thinks this is something ill just grow out of at  years old

lntuniv,"Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it. No gatekeeping in this post at all. If you believe you have a disorder, you should consult a medical professional what I disagree with is those who find a minor inconvenience in their daily life that they want to assume is a form of either autism or having ADHD, and not the fact that maybe they just forgot to do something one day. 

Furthermore, non licensed laypeople on any social media platform should not be providing information to the public persuading them they have any sort of disorder. If people want to cope, they cope however they find is necessary. If someone shares information stating they have a degree of some kind and the information is valid, that’s different. This post is regarding the accounts who discuss their ADHD for clout, views, and provide false information in the process. It’s truly disheartening to see people discuss their ADHD in a way that is not actually ADHD and is instead something completely unrelated. 

Yes there’s useful information available almost anywhere to the public, but there’s also TONS of accounts created just to spread false awareness on what ADHD is. And this isn’t specific to ADHD; this goes for other neurological disorders and how it’s glorified to the point where it comes off the wrong way. That’s all this post is about. Not gatekeeping any information here. I want those who need help to get help, not turn it into a fashion statement.

ETA: I also work in an emergency department and see this for too often in the workplace. Most of the time when people come in with their diagnosis, it comes from a TikTok that is not accurate to the diagnosis they were hoping to receive. Some people that have had a headache for two days claim it’s a brain injury and demand to be seen sooner than others. Their source is usually either TikTok or a blog post written by a non licensed professional. We run tests, scans, and find nothing. We usually don’t see them again and if we do, they come back with a different issue unrelated to the previous one with the same sources that misled them in the first place.","having adhd feels embarrassing now because of the hype around it no gatekeeping in this post at all if you believe you have a disorder you should consult a medical professional what i disagree with is those who find a minor inconvenience in their daily life that they want to assume is a form of either autism or having adhd and not the fact that maybe they just forgot to do something one day

lntuniv,"Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it. I believe it is both overdiagnosed *and* underdiagnosed, depending on where you are and what demographic you're part of. Research in my own country show this at least. Boys are over diagnosed with the hyperactivity version but underdiagnosed with the inattentive version. Girls are generally underdiagnosed in both. 

My theory is that the increase in diagnosing ADHD right now, is mainly because of all the adults who went undiagnosed their whole lives and now are made aware. The increased focus on women's health, have brought the lesser noticed ""versions"" of ADHD, OCD, autism etc into the light, for both sexes. All those who previously were just ""chronically depressed"" or had anxiety for some rather unknown reason, have now gotten a lot of help and inspiration to fight more for their case and actually figure out what is wrong, instead of getting a ""pathological"" diagnosis, that is ""We have figured out that you are struggling but we haven't a clue why"".","having adhd feels embarrassing now because of the hype around it i believe it is both overdiagnosed and underdiagnosed depending on where you are and what demographic youre part of research in my own country show this at least boys are over diagnosed with the hyperactivity version but underdiagnosed with the inattentive version girls are generally underdiagnosed in both

My theory is that tech/social media *is* impacting general population’s attentional processing, people are noticing, and then identifying with ADHD because it uses some of the same descriptors. Not realizing that actual, diagnostic ADHD is not just a short attention span from too much tiktok.

Same thing happening with other disorders. Someone feels depressed for a few days and for good reason, identify with major depressive disorder, which has criteria of months of sustained depression. Or mild neurotic traits identified with OCD.

There’s overlap between the language that describes the traits and which describes the true disorders, but that overlap does not account for the stark contrasts.

we need quality mental health education in schools and its just not happening most teachers wouldnt even be able to teach the nuances",[]

lntuniv,"Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it. Yes...but there's a difference between a psychiatrist saying you don't have ADHD, and them refusing to even evaluate ANYONE for it.

I ran into the 2nd type, and I called 15 different shrinks in my area and NOBODY would give me (or anyone else) an evaluation.

I think that should be illegal.  What would the AMA say about kidney specialists suddenly deciding they won't evaluate people for kidney stones?  They know it's a real thing, that people suffer greatly because of it, there is treatment available that can be life-changing, but they refuse to help.

Fuck those shrinks.

lntuniv,"Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it. Same with me. My mom once said in my teenage years that ""ADHD is a comorbidity that occurs with autism"" and so I never thought of analyzing the symptoms. 5 years later I had a wake up call from all the situations, saw these symptoms and most of them matched, they existed in me as far as I can remember in my life. Got an uncle of mine to diagnose me (he's a psychiatrist, lives in another country, so I just called him up one day and asked ""what if it's true"") and it turned out to be real.

The day my mom knew it, she was broken as she couldn't understand how to get rid of it. The day I got to know was when I realized how I wasn't the mistake here, and how it's all something not so under my control, I couldn't believe how much lighter I felt that day.

But to get an official diagnosis to start medication, I had to do the same process, counseling services, PCP, psychiatrist. The first one literally said on a video call that ""well I don't see any symptoms when I see you, which can be described as ADHD, so I'm going to ask you to pay for a test I'll be giving, we can then continue the discussion"". Searched for another one who then did that in a couple of minutes that I met them and agreed to start with medication. 

> Like I’ve seen people be like “I went to 3 different psychiatrists and all of them wouldn’t diagnose me” like then maybe you don’t have adhd??

And I think most people don't realize this, but there are many other disorders that mimic ADHD, like bipolar. Impulsivity, depression and hypomania, with frequent concentration issues, that's basically the same symptom set. Some have both of them.

Doctors did not consider how ADHD affects people who aren't prepubescent white boys until recently and a lot of doctors are still very uninformed and go by outdated information.  Every Psychologist who's expertise is ADHD I've seen has said that the name is misleading and the symptoms listed in the DSM are very limited and lack nuance. 

Every other day you see a post of someone getting denied a diagnosis for dumb reasons (because they did well in school, they're not fidgety, I saw one person say their doctor said they couldn't have ADHD because they had a job?), people getting denied meds they've been taking for years once they switch doctors, sometimes even the SAME doctor will do this shit, or now how since we are in a shortage we have a million stories about how people feel judged when looking for the meds they were prescribed.

My doctors would just straight up change the subject and refused even evaluate me or refer me somewhere. Like yeah the Tiktokers are annoying but at the end of the day ADHD was never taken seriously it's just a different font now, instead of ADHD being the ""boys will be boys disorder"" it's now a ""tiktok attention seeking disorder"".

I feel like this sub sometimes underestimates just how unreliable the medical community can be for people with ADHD, the reason why there's so much misinformation today is that a lot of people just don't have support outside of online because doctors don't give a fuck. They don't know what it looks like adults, and I think a lot of them lowkey just don't believe its real.

lntuniv,"Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it. I do think creators online have a responsibility to recognize that their audiences, especially on TikTok, are primarily young people who are easily influenced. Especially if they have a large platform. Certainly it's not acceptable to present a short list of ""possibly"" ADHD traits in your video and assert that people DEFINITELY have ADHD if they experience them. Sometimes you can tell someone is not trying to be helpful, but just trying to generate more attention and clout.

But if medical professionals fail to take me seriously because people are spreading misinformation about ADHD online, I really just interpret it as a failure on the medical professional's part. It's absolutely infuriating that a person who spent an absurd amount of time and money to get through an education so they could diagnose and treat ADHD (among other things) might think I'm lying about my experiences because of idiot kids on TikTok. That my care might be impacted because my doctor was influenced by fucking TikTok makes me want to scream, to be honest. And that's on the doctor, in my eyes.

Same with your coworkers, too. If they minimize your problems or fail to believe you just because of some idiots online, many of whom are teenagers or very young adults, that's really just a reflection of your coworkers. That's not to say I don't understand the frustration, though. But I think the majority of these people genuinely think they have ADHD, and they're so used to recording and uploading everything about their life, but never stopped to consider that what they're doing could have real consequences.

On another note though, have you really noticed no change at all while on these medications? Not even slight clarity, or fewer concurrent trains of thought? That's really interesting, but I hope you find something that works for you soon!","having adhd feels embarrassing now because of the hype around it i do think creators online have a responsibility to recognize that their audiences especially on tiktok are primarily young people who are easily influenced especially if they have a large platform certainly its not acceptable to present a short list of possibly adhd traits in your video and assert that people definitely have adhd if they experience them sometimes you can tell someone is not trying to be helpful but just trying to generate more attention and clout

lntuniv,"Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it. It's strange that our experiences are so different, considering tiktoks algorithm is very specific it really pushes adhd content to me at the minute but I have seen maybe 1-2 people in dozens that I thought ""hmm this doesn't seem like adhd to me"". But like... I'm also not a professional is the diagnostic space and everyone's adhd presents differently.


Also, my psychiatrist said the dsm needs updating again to reflect some sort of comorbidities. While he couldn't use them in particular for the actual diagnostic criteria, he did tell me eating disorders, skin picking, overly self critical thoughts, and sensory overwhelm are extremely common in those with adhd. So if for example you see a tiktok talking about adhd and their disordered eating, someone without it might (correctly) think ""well that's not adhd"". Because it's not, on its own, but the DSM is so particular that many people might discount themselves, so it's a good baseline of other common symptoms (but not diagnostic criteria ones) to help people.



When you say, people who think they have a disorder should consult a medical professional, what that originally looked like to me was going to my GP, them googling a list in front of me, asking me 6 random DSM based questions that are very ablist and narrow questions in the first place, and saying I have a masters and don't fidget enough so I can't have it. It was only after enough exposure to seeing what common other issues among adhd people are, did I feel confident enough to advocate for myself and pay to go private, bypassing the need for my GP. And like... my psychiatrist also has adhd so it's not like education = no adhd. 



One common comorbidity probably doesn't mean jack shit, but when they continually add up and compound then yeah, you start to realise and do more research. Even without tiktok,the idea of doing your own research can be taboo to doctors, but i would not have been diagnosed without it, i would have just believed ""well they say i dont fidget so i guess im out, i guess im just shit/lazy that it seems so hard to do basic shit everyday"". Especially among women I do believe we don't have enough exposure, I don't care if there's a small bit of misinformation in there as well. Women are more likely to be missed in childhood and have longer time to develop comorbidities which compound and mask everything making it very hard to sort through. Random ass videos making light of things and showing things that aren't necessarily adhd on their own, but common to some people with adhd, can be very helpful.","having adhd feels embarrassing now because of the hype around it its strange that our experiences are so different considering tiktoks algorithm is very specific it really pushes adhd content to me at the minute but i have seen maybe   people in dozens that i thought hmm this doesnt seem like adhd to me but like im also not a professional is the diagnostic space and everyones adhd presents differently

""A spectrum disorder is a mental disorder that includes a range of linked conditions, sometimes also extending to include singular symptoms and traits. The different elements of a spectrum either have a similar appearance or are thought to be caused by the same underlying mechanism. In either case, a spectrum approach is taken because there appears to be ""not a unitary disorder but rather a syndrome composed of subgroups"". The spectrum may represent a range of severity, comprising relatively ""severe"" mental disorders through to relatively ""mild and nonclinical deficits"".[1]"" (Wikipedia https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_disorder)

Plus the DSM is a diagnostic TOOL. It doesnt show the reality in full ~ and experts in this field of research have stated as much. It needs another update already, even though they have been continually doing so because the research coming out has been completely shifting the view of ADHD (and other disorders). Like ASD, there is a similarity in the cause of the dysfunction in our brains BUT how that presents for people is VASTLY different.

I was diagnosed with adhd 20 years or so ago. Maybe longer. No one seemed to think it was anything serious or worth treating so I didn't do anything about it. Fast forward to lockdown and way more social media time and I happened to run across adhd twitter.

so he accused them and me for agreeing with them of being homophobic for not giving him stimulants that could absolutely make his anxiety worse 

having really bad anxiety issues myself thats controlled by both an anti psychotic and a mood stabilizer seroquel  lamictal tried to explain that to him that even with the heavy combo of stuff im on stimulants still can and will exacerbate said anxiety issues but nope im an asshole

lntuniv,"Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it. Heyo, psych student w/adhd here. In psychopharm we learned quite a bit about nicotine and adderall. With folks like us, there tends to be a big shift towards both drinking and smoking, but for different reasons.

Smoking nicotine is easy to understand, it's a CNS (central nervous system) stimulant and promotes dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin just like adderall (except we also discovered it to be significantly more addictive). 

Whilst drinking tended to have a more social or societal reasoning (especially since alcohol is a CNS depressant, which would otherwise make issues with adhd worse if it weren't for the addition of the norepinephrine release that also comes from it).

Alcohol is seen as a socially acceptable way of hand waving all the downsides or perceived effects of adhd and the ability to ""unmask"" ones own symptoms under a veil of ""oh they're just drunk/buzzed"" which when said aloud is quite depressing. Folks with autism also tend to suffer with alcoholism as well due to this too.

prescription medications such as adderall tend to be a way of turning folks away from the addictiveness of nicotine, caffine, and alcohol. This is done with the aid of supervision by a doctor or clinician to observe the effects different medications have on the person with adhd's body. Some medications like ritalin and adderall run the risk of jacking up certain people's heart rate or causing too much dopamine to flow through the brain that they lose their appetite. Sometimes doctors shift towards SSRI'S to target specifically serotonin in an attempt to see if just raising one chemicals level will produce the desired effect while reducing the side effect burden.

Suffice to say, prescription drugs are far from perfect. And if you have a doctor that doesn't listen to you, tell you the interactions the drug has with other chemicals, or even asks about your current diet (spoiler: acidic foods and carbonated beverages shorten and dull the effects of adderall, ritalin, and many other CNS stimulants which may be the reason OP doesn't get any effect out of any of the drugs they have taken) Then it can be excruciatingly difficult to trust them. However, prescription drugs for adhd also tend to last a lot longer, and if tailored right to account for your own personal profile (genetics, other medications, doctor-patient communication) then they can end up garnering longer lasting relief with a lower chance of addiction, or even a better medication overall that actually tackles the pharmacokinetics/dynamics of the issues that are causing your adhd symptoms.

Hope this helps, and remember: always ask the doctor for the interactions, diet, and pharmacokinetics/dynamics of how the medication you are being prescribed will effect you. There are a lot of clinicians out there that will forget, neglect, or have never really understood/learned about the prescriptions that they are giving you (college tends to teach to remember connections, not explore concepts. Which tends to lead to bad diagnosis and treatments. But there really is no where else to go (at least in the U.S.)😥).","having adhd feels embarrassing now because of the hype around it heyo psych student wadhd here in psychopharm we learned quite a bit about nicotine and adderall with folks like us there tends to be a big shift towards both drinking and smoking but for different reasons

lntuniv,"Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it. When I was maybe idk 19 I was lucky enough to get a brain scan done by my childhood psychologist (the guy that diagnosed me when I was 9) for the price of a normal appointment because… I guess he just like, wanted to do it?  Idk how that works but he had the equipment so both me and my brother got one done.  

Even before the results were analyzed, with him just watching the screen, he was able to see abnormalities indicative of ADHD.  I was just sitting there with the electrodes attached to my head, and in between him constantly telling me to “stop thinking” (apparently it only works if you don’t think, they can tell whether you’re thinking or not, and I found it very difficult to NOT think for more than 2 seconds at a time, but I digress) he told me a few things along the lines of

“wow, you definitely have ADHD!”

“Yep there’s the ADHD!”

“Wow, no wonder you can’t sleep!” 

The machine would also make a little ping every time I blinked… it was trippy.  

After the results were recorded and analyzed and put on a bunch of fancy colored charts the verdict was yes, ADHD, but a specific type of ADHD where I have excessive beta waves in the back of my brain (they are mainly supposed to be relegated to the front) (also it might have been the other way around idk but there were too many beta waves SOMEWHERE).  Another interesting tidbit, he told me that a colleague of his who had also reviewed the results pointed out a part of my brain and said “this person struggles with social skills.”  It was a part of my brain responsible for recognizing facial expressions or something.  My psychologist said it was “similar to what people with autism have.”  Well lo and behold when I was 21 I was diagnosed with autism by another psychologist.

lntuniv,"Anyone try Gabapentin or Guanfacine for sleep? Will trazodone can be used as an antidepressant. It’s also used as a sleeping aid. Anti depressants are very beneficial for helping depression and anhedonia. You just need to talk to your dr and say what’s working or not working.  As far as the sleep, though trazodone does wonders for me 
  
I take an antidepressant called Wellbutrin for my depressive symptoms.","anyone try gabapentin or guanfacine for sleep will trazodone can be used as an antidepressant its also used as a sleeping aid anti depressants are very beneficial for helping depression and anhedonia you just need to talk to your dr and say whats working or not working  as far as the sleep though trazodone does wonders for me

I'm guessing lack of sleep is going to lead to anhedonia too. 
I tried Wellbutrin but it didn't work for me. Though I did sleep better on it.

lntuniv,"Anyone try Gabapentin or Guanfacine for sleep? It sucks man. But just keep working at it. Took me a while to find the right medication. But I learned I have to be more upfront about what I’m feeling on the medication and relay that to the doctor. The doctor does not know my whole personality or how my body works. 

Sleep is very very important. I would address the lack of sleep ASAP because it’s probably affecting other areas of your mental health.  Actually, it sounds like it is affecting your mental health.  A good night sleep as you know is a game changer. 

I would call my doctor today or as soon as possible and see if they can prescribe you something to help you sleep. That is very important right now. I wish you the best of luck.
