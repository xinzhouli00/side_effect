Too much Paxil makes me numb and has sexual side effects. 

I also switched to adderall IR so I could control the length of dose better. Many days I have no need for the effects to last so long. I noticed the more I took and the longer I stayed stimulated, the worse the crash was.

adderall,"I‚Äôm new to adderall, just got my Rx for ADHD a bit over a week ago.

My experience with XR so far is that when I take it it feels more or less like the IR, and then around 4 hours later as it started to fade I fell another ‚Äúup‚Äù from it.

I have read that XR is composed of half beads that release more or less right away and half beads that release after about 4 hours. I have felt that there was another bump in effects in the middle, but what I‚Äôve read says it‚Äôs just two release times.

It seems to me that one could do their own custom tailored dosing with IR, like if your baseline dose is 10mg you could take 10mg in the morning then 3 or 3.5 hours later take 5mg, and then after another hour take the other 5mg. But I haven‚Äôt tried this and would definitely suggest running it by your prescribing psychiatrist first.","im new to adderall just got my rx for adhd a bit over a week ago

adderall,"First off, going from a 55-65 heart rate to 75 is completely normal and even expected on Adderal being that it‚Äôs a stimulating drug.  Adderall stimulates the release of neurotransmitters like norepinephrine and dopamine, which can raise heart rate and blood pressure. These effects can persist even during sleep, particularly if the medication was taken later in the day or if your more sensitive to stimulants.

I‚Äôve been on adderal as a kid and just got it prescribed to me again about 2 months ago. I have the same side effects as you. My resting heart rate before was around 75-85 but when I started taking adderal again it was commonly +100 just sitting it felt like my heart is beating too fast. I even went to the ER because I walked into work and used my friends Apple Watch to monitor my heart and it was 140 with no prior exercise, just standing there. Now, although my heart rate can still be high sometimes, it has gotten better and I have been less worried about it. I bought a finger heart rate monitor to keep an eye on it throughout the day. My advice would be to keep taking it as prescribed. Drinking plenty of water throughout the day and eating properly will cause less strain on your cardiovascular system. I almost completely cutout energy drinks from my diet also.  Heart palpitations aren‚Äôt too serious unless they‚Äôre accompanied with shortness of breath, dizziness, chest pain things like that. If your heart rate gets worse or even develops those side effects it would be smart to talk to your doctor to see if you could lower your dosage or switching to a non stimulant medication works better for you. 

Sleeping is also a hard thing. Once I started taking them I couldn‚Äôt fall asleep, for sometimes an entire night. I work nights with a roommate that works days so I take my meds right before work, and when I get off try and go to bed asap. Although I found that rewinding and taking more time for my body to finish breaking down the medication helps a lot. I tried melatonin and it works off and on. I would say try to time when you take your medication more early in the day. If you take XR the drug could be out of your system in 8-12 hours. On the other hand, if you take IR then it could be 4-6 hours. Rewinding, taking away screens before bed and eating before bed all seem to help me.

The best thing you can do is to keep monitoring it and if your body doesn‚Äôt adjust to it over time or if it is still concerning you definitely talk to your doctor to see what the best option going forward is. Wish you luck man!","first off going from a   heart rate to  is completely normal and even expected on adderal being that its a stimulating drug  adderall stimulates the release of neurotransmitters like norepinephrine and dopamine which can raise heart rate and blood pressure these effects can persist even during sleep particularly if the medication was taken later in the day or if your more sensitive to stimulants

adderall,It‚Äôs not as addictive for me for whatever reason. I started 6 months ago. You‚Äôll find that when you don‚Äôt have things to do you won‚Äôt even want to take it. Like during the weekends when you want to relax and not work or study like me. I take it in the morning before eating only because I feel it works better for me.

Vyvanse is similar to Dexedrine but it is long acting. Vyvanse also tends to work better for most people, there aren‚Äôt as many different brand of generics for it yet so I think the formulation is close to the brand name since generics have only been available for it since last year. 

Not sure l tyrosine would make much of a difference but it can‚Äôt hurt. 

Magnesium glycinate is great to take, also b6, well a good b complex. B complex injections are even better. 

Dexedrine can deplete the dopamine in your brain because it‚Äôs so strong. 

I take supplements and they really help, I tried nootropics but they didn‚Äôt help me. Just don‚Äôt take vitamin C or eat oranges right before or after take Dexedrine, I know it can interfere with the absorption of Adderall, so it might interfere with the absorption of Dexedrine too. 

I‚Äôd switch to Vyvanse if I were you. 

I hope some of this has been helpful. I‚Äôm no expert but I figured I‚Äôd comment since no one else has.

Dexedrine is the oldest stimulant medication that is still prescribed but it isn‚Äôt prescribed that often. It might be the manufacturer of the generic that the pharmacy gave you or it might be that it just doesn‚Äôt work for you.

I remember taking it, it ended up cancelling my sleep pattern. Said to take it before bed, end up getting up way too early because of it. So why magnesium?

B6 is ok. Fish oil on a consistent basis puts a wall for any brain fog. So I think fish oil trumps B6.

Tyrosine or theanine can help elevate dopamine or influence it. Just don‚Äôt take them higher than a gram and only sparingly. You‚Äôd end up low and buzzed out if you do, my experience atleast.. or take it if you know you‚Äôre going to get a well rounded nutrition for a whole week.

tyrosine or theanine can help elevate dopamine or influence it just dont take them higher than a gram and only sparingly youd end up low and buzzed out if you do my experience atleast or take it if you know youre going to get a well rounded nutrition for a whole week

nothing jumpstarts anyone i bet yourself as well with adderall how do you replenish your dopamine if theyre exhausted thanks for replying",[]
adderall,"I‚Äôve recently changed from IR to ER 
I‚Äôm on my second month in ER and for me ER works way better. I had a similar experience with ER with Concerta prior to switching to adderal IR and then ER.
My Dr asked to try the IR first and to see if we could manage my symptoms but I found the headaches after medication wore off to be unbearable. With the ER I barely have any side effects and no headaches. ER is a gradual release, I notice when the second portion of the dose is released. I don‚Äôt feel it as intense as IRs even with the doses being the same this could be because of the time release mechanism.","ive recently changed from ir to er

adderall,"Hi I‚Äôm not sure your age but I‚Äôve been diagnosed with ADHD and I feel that is was a late diagnosis for me.
I think there are a lot of common characteristics of ADHD but it does look differently in each person. As you said, I also felt like I never really struggled with it in grade school or academics for the most part. But, as I‚Äôve gotten older and tasks have been increasingly harder for me to do, it was undeniable to me which is why I was diagnosed a few months ago. I‚Äôve been done with schooling for a few years now and have been working FT for a while. 

I felt the same that you did and was really scared that getting diagnosed and becoming medicated would derail my career and my life. I will say being diagnosed and being medicated has drastically changed my life for the better. It is so relieving to be able to get my work done and actually feel motivated to start/complete tasks. 

If you do choose to get diagnosed and want to be medicated I will warn you that Adderall is highly regulated by the DEA currently (They call it a shortage but it‚Äôs really not lol). So it is much harder to get at certain pharmacies. There are times when I have to shop around and communicate to my psychiatrist which pharmacy to send my prescription to. It doesn‚Äôt always happen but I just wanted to give you a heads up.

adderall,"Hi, honestly it is hard to say for me. Growing up, I knew kids in my class who were ADHD and they were the type of kids that would be hyperactive and very disobedient. I always thought I could never be ADHD because I wasn‚Äôt like those kids at all. However, I know ADHD typically has multiple classifications: inattentive type, hyperactive/impulsive type or a combo. I feel I identify with the inattentive type the most. As I‚Äôve gotten older, I think it‚Äôs gotten worse. I find myself zoning out, not able to listen to verbal instructions/directions, and trying to do other tasks while someone is talking to me. (Sometimes i feel trapped and restless in certain conversations). It sounds like we have some similarities.  I think you and I may have a mild form of ADHD meaning we were able to manage it fairly well in our lives until certain obligations of adulthood and FT careers. Again, sometimes a professional diagnosis helps just for peace of mind even if you‚Äôre not looking to get medicated.

In the link below, blood serum pH (acidity or basicness) and the lower the pH the weaker the effect. This is why Tums potentiates Adderall, but if you raised the pH of the entire body the same dose might be hell and cause unpleasant things like tachycardia.
