Vyvanse,"Vyvanse Hair Loss I have four practical suggestions that won‚Äôt require you to give up Vyvanse (caveat: I have only tried the first three myself):

1) use bond builders like K18 leave in molecular hair mask, Olaplex No. 3, or Redken acidic bonding concentrate. (There are others, but I haven‚Äôt tried them. I alternate between these 3, and use one every other wash.) They will strengthen the hair you have, causing less breakage, which will make your hair appear thicker. The appearance of my hair began improving after my very first use, which helped  calm my anxiety. These will cost you  anywhere from $50 - $150 a month. 

2) Platelet rich plasma (PRP) injections. My dermatologist did a series of 3 treatments, spaced 4 weeks apart. I had great results. I have heard platelet rich fibrin produces even better results, but I haven‚Äôt tried it. The cost for me was $2500, but it varies by location.

3) Test your ferritin levels and supplement if low. Theres a prescription form of iron that your doc can prescribe. Your hair can‚Äôt grow if you don‚Äôt have sufficient iron.  Cost should be minimal.

4) Oral minoxidil. I have a prescription and will start soon. Both my dermatologist and endocrinologist highly recommend it.

Vyvanse,"non-breakfast eaters, what do you eat when taking your meds? The reason it is recommended to eat breakfast is because you need protein for dopamine and norepinephrine production. Specifically, you need tyrosine, an amino acid you derive from protein. 

If you have a hard time eating or want to do intermittent fasting, try supplementing with tyrosine in the morning. It‚Äôs very beneficial if you have low/no protein intake, as the efficacy of Vyvanse is restricted if there‚Äôs a low level of tyrosine available. 

Tyrosine will be created by the body from phenylalanine, but that metabolism doesn‚Äôt seem to speed up commensurately with Vyvanse trying to ramp up your dopamine and norepinephrine production. So directly increasing tyrosine availability is beneficial in allowing the drug to work optimally. That is, if you‚Äôre fasting. If you eat protein then there‚Äôs basically no need to supplement.","non breakfast eaters what do you eat when taking your meds the reason it is recommended to eat breakfast is because you need protein for dopamine and norepinephrine production specifically you need tyrosine an amino acid you derive from protein

Vyvanse,90% Sure This Isn‚Äôt My Dose Have you talked to your doctor about doing your 40 in the morning and then doing like a bump up of 10 or 20 mg in the afternoon.

But talk to your doctor about it because I told my doctor how I like crash and burn about 4 to 5 hours after taking my 20 mg. He said we could work up to doing 20 in the morning and 20 in the afternoon or should just take 40 in the morning I don't know which one I want to do because I feel 20 isn't enough but I'm on 30 and I still feel like I'm crashing and burning and so exhaustedly like by night time I am so tired I can't handle it It's so bad I can't concentrate I can't stay awake I keep falling asleep like I have narcolepsy or something and that was never how I was before Vyvanse I had sleep issues where I couldn't go to sleep I like the fact that it helps me be sleepy but it's almost too aggressive and it happens too early in the day.

Vyvanse,"90% Sure This Isn‚Äôt My Dose Ok I‚Äôve heard this comment more than you‚Äôve been saying so I‚Äôm going to be blunt about my thinking (and questions) toward the water titration. 
1.) it doesn‚Äôt logically (yes I still believe it works great for everyone that tries it) make sense why being prescribed 40mg for your focus somehow translates to 20mg in the morning suddenly working. I know why taking it spread out works‚Ä¶but how does 20mg give you enough focus in the day? 
2.) I don‚Äôt like not *knowing* the *exact* amount of medicine üíä I am taking. So I tried the water titration already‚Ä¶and I screwed up‚Ä¶well I felt like I did. There I was wondering exactly how much I took. My goal was 45mg to theoretically get longer than 40mg without the intensity of 50mg, and I felt like I took 30 or 35mg, it sucked. 
3.) I think long term and don‚Äôt want to do any more ‚Äúwork‚Äù every morning that‚Äôs more than just popping a pill in my mouth. And also, I work at home so it‚Äôs easy to leave my 2nd dose near, but when out and about, I have a water container I never leave home without so don‚Äôt want to mess with taking more things.

I went off those meds after I started dating a guy in high school. I wanted to be with him so bad, so we stayed together for 3 years. I cared about him immensely, but I knew that we had to end it.
After I graduated college, I got diagnosed with MDD (major depressive disorder). I saw another psychiatrist who prescribed me Vyvanse again. It made me feel like I could finally go out into the world and do everything again.. But because I needed meds and my family knew I needed help, I stayed home (in the place I grew up), and did the things I loved. I played instruments (I got a music degree), and I made TikToks. One person commented something negative, so I took that as a sign to quit making content on there.
I made YouTube videos when I was younger so I started posting my stuff on there. I wrote and produced my own EP, in a house that I was house/dogsitting at. I‚Äôm so proud of that work because it‚Äôs the most accurate representation of how I feel.
I started working corporate jobs again after that. I got a full-time job at a bank, and I had a REALLY hard time there. I found everything to not make any sense, no matter how hard I tried. I went through a long & difficult trial-&-error period of antidepressants (since I was already taking 60 mg Vyvanse).

But I worked with mostly men, and I‚Äôm biologically female, so I felt like I needed to quit. I then put my 2 weeks in, over email.

Vyvanse,"I'm thinking of switching to Ritalin...  Your dose is one of the lowest doses you can get; it goes up to 70. I am at 30mg for a few weeks or someshit now and i'm getting about 4-6 hours. I don't get a crash, I wish I did, but I do get the dry mouth. I just don't feel the extreme focus part after 6 hours and I start to become forgetful/stupid again.  I will be upping my dose soon probably because of that.

I do think that the vyvanse is working even though i don't ""feel it."" Because I can sit for a long time, calmly, and work for 6ish hours after the super focus part wears off. Which is something I struggled with, before that.

It's very possible the dose is just low. If you bring it up to your doctor they may have you take double dose, or two in the same day or something or just increase it. I'd just talk to them before giving up. You didn't really mention anything bad here to just give up on it like that. If you told me you were suicidal while on vyvanse that's a different story; but you only said good things, outside of the duration.

Put it this way, if you get your dose right and the effective duration increases, and you crash at an appropriate time, is it such a problem?","im thinking of switching to ritalin  your dose is one of the lowest doses you can get it goes up to  i am at mg for a few weeks or someshit now and im getting about   hours i dont get a crash i wish i did but i do get the dry mouth i just dont feel the extreme focus part after  hours and i start to become forgetfulstupid again  i will be upping my dose soon probably because of that

Vyvanse,"I'm thinking of switching to Ritalin...  How long have you been taking it? It's possibly it could be the dose is too low, but it's also possible it could be too high. üòÖ

My Dr started me at 10mg and it felt great at first, but I titrated up too quickly and I thought it was wearing off too quickly a few hours in. I was irritable and confused/disorganized, and hyperfocusing on the wrong things with little ability to tear myself away. I stopped taking it and switched to biphentin (ritalin) because I didn't like the irritability.

The biphentin was horrible for me. I felt like I was moving in slow motion and my body was so heavy. When I adjusted to that I thought maybe it was ok cause I was able to do some stuff with will power and not getting as sucked in to the wrong things. But before long my RSD got WAY worse and I was super depressed and self conscious.

I had a couple vyvanse left (10mg capsules) so I took one one day to see how it felt, now that I had felt the biphentin. I had the best day, so much energy and my confidence was way up! Second time around once I switched back I took it slower. And I noticed after a week and a half at 10mg when I went up to 20mg it was good the first day, but after a few days I knew it was the ""too much"" feeling again.

So I alternated between 10mg and 20mg each day until I adjusted to that (about another couple weeks) and then stuck to 20mg /day for a while. After a while I noticed it sometimes wasn't enough (I find intense cardio burns through it faster for example, and I was adapting) so I did the same thing with alternating between 20 and 30mg. I've been back on it for over 3 months now and I'm still at 30mg, some days only having 20mg if I feel I don't need the full 30 that day.

I'm using the water titration method now and it is SO much better!! I don't really feel the ""come-up"" all that much. I know when it is kicking in but it's more of like ok I feel like I can get up and start doing things and I WANT to! Vs the burst of energy I would get when I first started taking it, and when I had too much. I sometimes hyperfocus on the wrong things but I'm usually able to pull  myself away if I need to and I've been able to actually use a schedule! ü§Ø

With taking sips throughout the morning I find it feels so much smoother where I don't get the peaks in anxiety and increased heart rate, and it lasts longer because it is being processed over time vs all at once. Before this I was taking 2 capsules in the morning and one around noon. Now I empty 2 capsules into a marked waterbottle in the morning, shake it up, and drink a few decent sips right away. Then I sip while getting ready until I've had 10mg. The other 10 I will drink until around 10/11. Then usually I will add water and another capsule around 11/12 and drink that over the next hour or two, depending what I have going on that evening. I haven't had issues falling asleep so this way won't work for everyone but it does for me! I find I'm getting tired around the time I want to go to sleep.

So yea devils advocate lol since it affects everyone so differently I wanted to mention this possibility. I have seen many others commenting in this sub that they had very similar experiences of feeling like it was wearing off around 2-4 hours in and trying to up their dosage, only to discover it was actually from having too much. It shouldn't feel like a buzz/manic type thing like coffee, when I'm at the right dose I just feel good. Content, but able to do things without having to mentally berate myself or get an adrenaline rush from a tight deadline. Just... functional!!

Vyvanse,"I'm thinking of switching to Ritalin...  That's odd I find it lasts long for me. Like sometimes i notice isually even notice an everning boost. Maybe it's the way your metabolism/liver is processing it? I rea that magnesium hydroxate from Roland's can prolong amphetamine chemical? And yes, I noticed all those benefits too - even the anxiety reduction (which is odd since it's a stimulant)

But warn you if u switch to Ritalin, it may not be effective or may be anxious type of feeling or side effects etc. Ritalin is typically the most short acting stimulant, unless u consider an extended version like Concerta. Still taking a big gamble imo.

Have u suggested maybe requesting your Dr to prescribe a short acting adderall or dexedrine ""booster"". That request may get denied, but it's worth a try (if u feel comfortable with asking) .

Vyvanse,"I started a week ago after being diagnosed at 45 I thought my adhd was depression as well. I was chasing my depression issues on my own since my teens because I couldn't afford to go to a doctor, and I was afraid of antidepressants turning me into a crazy person.   I learned all the bullshit and read all the books about depression. I was constantly on this cycle of getting depressed and trying to claw my way out of it and know how to do it, for the most part. So I never got checked out.

I found out I had adhd when I was playing a game and YouTube autoplayed into a lecture about what untreated ADHD looks like (video is called ""The Shame of ADHD"") and they were literally speaking my life. I was fortunate to hear a part that grabbed my attention while focused on the game. After that I sat and researched it for a few months and sure enough that was my problem the entire time. I got diagnosed at 33, like 4 months ago.

I got super lucky, honestly. If I went into the doctor without the understanding from my research that I for sure had adhd, they surely would have put me on antidepressants and it wouldn't have solved my problem. And I would have gone through every antidepressant they have.  They assumed it was something else trauma/depression related.  They were offering me anxiety/antidepressant medication like it was candy. But when it came to the adhd meds, that was a nightmare to get done.

Vyvanse,"Drinking on Vyvanse Ive been on Vyvanse for about 3 months and this has been my experience; When I started Vyvanse I found my body kind of rejected alcohol even in small amounts. I have a very sensitive body, so different drugs tend to really affect me and cause negative side effects. At the time it would make me feel nauseous, more anxious, increase my heart rate and make me feel totally off, and so I took over a month off from having even a sip of alcohol. Fast forward to now, my body has fully adjusted to the meds and I find I can happily enjoy a night out with multiple drinks, and not have to worry about any side effects! If anything I find Vyvanse makes me feel less intoxicated and if I‚Äôm crashing, I might be more inclined to reach for more alcohol. Be very careful of this because it could be a steep slope. Always be mindful of how much you‚Äôre consuming and match it with water to make sure you‚Äôre hydrated. Personally, unless I have projects I want to get done on the weekend, I usually like to take Sat and Sun off from my Vyvanse to be able to rest.

Vyvanse,"Could a higher dose help the crash? Check the generic manufacturer of your Vyvanse every time you get it filled. Oftentimes people are very sensitive to the different manufacturers; this is particularly true of meds that act on the CNS and especially those that are extended-release it seems. Vyvanse's extended-release mechanism doesn't rely on gut pH like most others do, but it's still susceptible to variation between manufacturers. Pharmacies often change generic manufacturers from time to time, especially now that these stimulants have been in shortage. I suppose they're simply getting what they can get at this point.

A lot of people have complained about generic Vyvanse doing this and have switched to brand-name for this reason. It's a lot more expensive that way as insurance usually won't cover brand-name meds when there is a generic available. Some people are *somehow* able to get it covered though, but it's still slightly more expensive this way.

Adding a second dose of Vyvanse in the middle of the day could possible help with the crash. A higher dose might actually *worsen* the crash as your blood levels would have a lot further to fall from a higher dose.

Vyvanse,"Could a higher dose help the crash? You likely need to go up, yeah, if it feels intense give it 3-4 days to see how it levels out, as there's a huge difference between day 1 and day 7 of a new dose. If it ends up just not working out for you though, it's common to take a 2nd dose sometime around 5 hours after the first, which you can ask your doc about if your adhd symptom control is good on 20.",could a higher dose help the crash you likely need to go up yeah if it feels intense give it   days to see how it levels out as theres a huge difference between day  and day  of a new dose if it ends up just not working out for you though its common to take a nd dose sometime around  hours after the first which you can ask your doc about if your adhd symptom control is good on,[]

Vyvanse,"Could a higher dose help the crash? No, it won‚Äôt help. The crash will always come; an increase is just going to put the crash off for another week or two.but after that couple weeks, the crash returns.

Vyvanse,"Could a higher dose help the crash? Sorry if this seems obvious just checking, have you been drinking lots of water, had a high protien breakfast and good sleep? These are the 3 things that usually stop a crash. Also, have you cut out caffiene?

Definitely worth speaking to your prescriber to see if 30mg helps, if you feel it's too intense again you could always drop back to 20mg","could a higher dose help the crash sorry if this seems obvious just checking have you been drinking lots of water had a high protien breakfast and good sleep these are the  things that usually stop a crash also have you cut out caffiene

Vyvanse,"Could a higher dose help the crash? Could be the lack of sleep causing the crash, is it the meds that are keeping you up or have you always struggled with sleep?

How long ago did you cut out caffiene? The first couple weeks of caffiene withdrawal can be pretty rough I had heachaches and felt really fatigued.

Do always speak to your prescriber before going up a dose, it is pretty normal for people to need to go up a dose though.","could a higher dose help the crash could be the lack of sleep causing the crash is it the meds that are keeping you up or have you always struggled with sleep
