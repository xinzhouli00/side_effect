Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,"I've had an overall very positive experience with guanfacine. It took about a month for me to notice any changes in focus and motivation, but now its completely changed my abilty to get things done. I used to procrastinate endlessly, now I can break projects down.

I've been on for over a year and it hasn't had a noticeable impact on my libido. It has definitely helped my anxiety, in similar ways to what you described in your update.

Highly recommend taking it about an hour before bed if you don't already, it helps me sleep at night and I still get all the benefits of the extended release the next day."
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,"I personally had a negative experience with guanfacine for a few reasons. It can lower your blood pressure, and for me that made me EXTREMELY tired and dropped my BP into the 40s at some points. Its impulse control methodology basically makes your reward pathways less responsive, and for me that made me extremely unmotivated and depressed in a way I had never felt before. I took guanfacine for two months & am diagnosed with ADHD and PTSD for reference. I thought maybe these side effects would go away with time, so I took all the pills prescribed to me. As soon as I got off them I started to feel better and got back on Adderall. 
There are some people on Reddit with positive experiences, including people who couple guanfacine with stimulants! :] I hope it is a better experience for you, and if not then I hope hearing my experience makes you feel less alone. My doctor did not go into the details on side effects for me so I was pretty blindsided by it."
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,"My psych prescribed 1mg for a week then 2mg the second weak onwards. I’m on my second week now and the body weakness, dizziness and lack of energy is unbearable. It’s so much effort walking up and down the stairs. Sometimes when I stand up my heads spins and my vision gets blurry like I’m going to pass out.
Also started breaking out but that could be because my skin care routine has lapsed.

I’m trying to figure out if the potential benefits are worth how I’m feeling now."
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,"I’m glad I found this thread! How is everyone who’s started it feeling now? 

I’ve been on guanfacine for about 6 weeks now and I’m really struggling with fatigue still. Walking up and down the stairs is hard and I can’t go a day without a nap. I have the occasional good days but they leave me wiped the day after. I even passed out from dizziness last week, and that’s after being reduced for 4 to 3 tablets. I’m almost ready to throw the towel in. Does it get better?!"
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,"Around a year ago, I took Tenex ( instant release ) at .5mg (was given 1mg but I halved them) with dextroamphetamine 3 times daily. I would then take 1mg 1 hour before bed.   


At time time I was trying many anti depressants as my depression was worsening, and I wanted a low does during the day because I didn't want any of those 2-4% side effects I had read about.   


However within a month even at that low dose, I think it really helped, sadly I had to stop taking it because of some interactions with an antidepressant I tried, and I just now am attempting to resume use.   
I had no luck with antidepressants, but eventually tried ECT, and it was vey successful, so the first thing I am going to try is ER at night with my current ADHD medicine (Lisdexamfetamine)  


I will also be trying my IR routine, with 3 a day dextroamphetamine to see how it works after ECT, as before I think depression really stiffened of the benefits that Guanfacine gave to aid in the fight against ADHD.   


I will update what I find out, but I can say, I would of absolutely lost my job at once point if not for the combination, I ultimately lost my job on a ""leave to deal with insomnia from the worsening depression"" because I didnt check my snail mail. (Walmart.. yeah Ill rat them out)  


However, that was a blessing in disguise, because while it took nearly a year, I do not believe I would of been able to afford ECT without state funded healthcare. I am very optimistic about my future now, including the potential benefits of Guanfacine now that it doesn't have to fight the anxiety and nervous ticks of my depression.  


TLDR, Guanfacine is worth trying, even if it doesn't work for you, just titrate off of it slowly as it has some pretty crazy side effects even if you don't think it's working, oh look something shiny."
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,My son started taking this in May. Upped dose from 1 to 2 after a month. I think he’s doing really well on this. He’s more himself than on the stimulants. I may just try him on only this for the school year and see how he does. He seems more anxious on this than the stimulants though.
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,Thank you OP for posting your experience - I have similar challenges and needs. My psychiatrist just prescribed me this plus a ginseng supplement. Your feedback is super helpful!
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,I don’t have an answer but am curious the response. Similar situation although I am a 34f trying to start an adhd medication for the first time. This was brought up as an option.

Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,Following as I'm due to start this week too!
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,[deleted]
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,Do you take the extended release version or immediate release? I’ve noticed a big difference in Tenex vs intuniv
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,"For me, the side effects made me irritable and sad.  So I weened off it."
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,Omg this is what’s happening to me; starting month two tomorrow and I have had a headache because my bp is so low. I have no motivation and never want to get out of bed. I have 6 weeks left in my bachelors program and have had desire to do any work. Like I can’t retain anything I read and instantly start to fall asleep when I read! It’s awful! (37/f here)
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,"Thank you for your input!

I'm only on day 2 so far so I'm not really sure if I'm noticing anything though I am keeping an eye on my heart rate. My average resting heart rate is 56 and yesterday it did get to 45 but that could also have been a glitch in my watch as it happened only once. I am watching it though.

I'd really love to be able to get Adderall again but it's just not possible right now, I see people have found success on the combo of Intuniv and stimulants and I have an appointment with my doc at the end of a month on this med. So I'll stick it out and see what happens."
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,"My doctor started me off at 2mg right away so I got hit with the low heart rate, tiredness, and dizziness right away. It wasn't quite as bad as what you're experiencing though.

I'd say watch your heart rate if you can and try to drink a lot of water and caffeine to help while your body adjusts. I also found that b12 supliments helped.

I'm breaking out now but it's more along with my cycle as usual and I don't know that these meds affected that.

It did take about 3 weeks for the tiredness to go away.

This drug does wonders for emotial regulation more than anything else, I've not gotten into a depressive state since I started taking it which is something that happened often before. I also feel like I'm less under water with this. It doesn't really help with motivation but it does help me not get distracted by nagging thoughts and feelings.

If you can push through the tiredness I think the end result is pretty good.

I've had two instances of emotional upheaval in the past week that normally would have sent me to a very dark place but on this drug I'm able to acknowledge that bad things happened and deal with it rather than crying in my room for a week with a tub of ice cream."
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,"Wo wo wo how much of this stuff are you taking??? I take 2mg once a day at night, taking 4 tablets seems insane! My BP was hitting 40 with just 1 tablet, I'm through the fatigue now and don't feel it at all anymore. I do kickboxing 3x a week."
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,I'm gonna start it on Monday and I'll update this periodically to let others know my experience. I was going to start it sooner but I'm going to be driving 3 hours to a wedding and the pharmacist told me not to start it until I'm back.
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,Well I took my first pill last night and don't feel much sooo I guess we'll see. I'm tired but I also got very drunk on Saturday at the wedding I went to and I haven't actually gotten drunk in several years so I may be tired because I'm older and a hangover is different in my 30's than my 20's lol
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,"Day 3! Very, very tired, and I'm not sure if my anxiety has been reduced due to the drug or if anxiety-inducing things just haven't happened in the past few days. So I can't really say it's doing much yet, as I'm only on day 3 it's really hard to tell."
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,Lol it's in the comment
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,It took about a month. If your only side effect is drowsiness I'd wait it out. The chest pains I'd talk to your dr about.
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,What differences have you noticed?
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,"Extended release, the other is not really meant for ADHD as its used for high blood pressure typically."
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,How long were you on it? Did you have any problems weaning off of it?
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,"This is sooo great to hear. 

I think because my diet is pretty bad in terms of not eating enough that it’s probably making things a lot worse.
Last night I only took 1mg instead of 2mg and today although I still feel pretty weak it’s way less extreme than it’s been.

My heart rate is usually quite high so it’s been in the low 60s to 70s now with the occasional dip below 60. I check my blood pressure once a week too.

I’m trying to stick with it as I really want my emotional dysregulation in check, I’m just mindful of the fact that I’m working so much slower at work now. Hopefully I’ll get similar results to you and it’ll all be worth it 🤞🤞"
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,"3mg, I was up to 4 but I felt unable to drive at that dose, let alone anything else! That’s good you’re able to keep up exercise on that dose! How long have you been on it?"
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,How about that update?
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,"> state funded healthcare. I am very optimistic about my future now, including the potential benefits of Guanfacine now that it doesn't have to fight the anxiety and nervous ticks of my depression.  
>  
>TLDR, Guanfacine is worth trying, even if it doesn't work for you, just titrate off of it slowly as it ha

I believe there are strong contraindications of consuming alcohol while on guanfacine."
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,Any update?
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,Which one is which?
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,Abt 1-2  maths
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,"If you're used to a higher heart rate I'm sure this definitely feels more exhausting for you! My average resting heart rate (according to my Samsung smart watch) is generally 56/58 this med has dropped me into the low 40's but it's definitely better now.

I have a pro athlete heart rate with a curvy girl body lol"
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,"This is a fairly normal effect of guanfacine. This drug is an alpha 2a agonist, these drugs were (or in some cases still are) used for hypertension. I am a 210lb 5'9"" bodybuilder and I developed what looks like POTS on guanfacine! Luckily, it seems to be dose dependent. I was on 5mg, but now down to 1mg, and I plan on getting off completely. In the beginning it seemed to help a little with something, though I am not really sure what - hard to put my finger on it. But the weirdest part was, guanfacine worsened my already poor sleep. Even if I took it in the morning. Everyone is different, so listen to your body! I didn't feel 'good' in the gym again until I really got <2mg. I had no idea it was affecting me that much. I even went to a neurologist and rheumatologist for these weird things going on, and the neurologist was the one who made the connection between my body symptoms and the Intuniv."
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,"I'm aware, which is why I did not start taking them until I was home after traveling back from the wedding. I was tired from the wedding more tired than 3 hour travel should make me the next day. I did drink at the wedding so I was thinking maybe that attributed to my sleepiness as I didn't want to blame the pill after only one day."
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,"Well this is day 9 and I'm less tired the lowest my heart rate hit was 41 when generally 53 is my lowest and my average is 56.

I haven't really felt anything positive yet, I'm struggling a lot with task avoidance like a lot right now.

Reviews that I've read say that they were glad to have stuck with it so I'm still holding out hope things could get better!"
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,Updated!
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,"Yeah I had to adjust my watch to stop going off when I was at 100bpm and reset it to 110bpm

😂 curvy girl bodies unite!! ✊"
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,"I saw a post from you from a few months ago where you gave quite a praise to guanfacine. I'm really curious if you think that was placebo, or if the effects were truly there but waned (extra curious about the perfect pitch). Could it be that you titrated too quickly? It seems that there is little agreement among doctors as to what the dosages and titration schedules should be (a natural consequence of the lack of FDA approval for adults, I guess). I'm wondering if it takes longer to build cumulative effects than people realize and titrating too quickly results in good effects at first, but then the dose becomes overwhelming.

I'm on 3mg myself at the moment, titrated from 1 and 2 over the course of 3 weeks. Had a very good effect at 1mg that disappeared, but I think it's coming back at higher doses (I'm now second-guessing whether I'm just starting to feel the cumulative effect). For now, it actually seems to help with the gym, I set a couple of PRs on it already and feel more energized. Did you feel that way at the beginning at all?"
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,"I just got prescribed it and I’m so scared to take it. I have 6 kids under 12, that I have home with me. So I’m afraid to be too tired to take care of them 😖"
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,Still going well??
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,How did the side effects you've detailed here end up changing (if at all)?
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,"You're absolutely right, and frankly I think my body might have just gotten used to it.. Or the sides came on slowly. I'm not so sure!! But both (good and bad) were very much real"
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,"Yeah im sure that will be hard, maybe start it on the weekend when you might have some help. Make sure you drink a lot of water because my mouth and nose dried out until I really upped my water. I also have issues with B12 so I've been taking supplements and that also seems to help with the tiredness.

I know it's scary I'm still nervous about it it not helping at all but other reviews say that it works well after a few weeks. Not everyone but that's what the people who say it works say."
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,"Yes!

So I'm not feeling as tired anymore, that sort of subsided. My heart rate still drops pretty low at times (low 40's) but I guess my body is getting used to it because it doesn't make me as sleepy as it did before.

I do take some b12 and drink tea but I have a history of deficiency with b12 and I don't drink tea excessively. I'm really not great at drinking enough water and I really need to work on it.

As for positives it's taken my doom spirals away, I had an upset two nights ago. Something like that in the past would have put me in a very dark space for at least a few days but I was able to pull myself together and leave it behind. It feels weird in a way like it wasn't hard to move past it at all so it almost doesn't feel like a triumph even though it really really is, it just felt, natural.

I don't have as much task avoidance but I still do struggle with it. I'm going to see about starting on Concerta again to add a stimulant to it, Concerta had made me depressed within 3 days of starting it and even though I could get stuff done it wasn't worth it. I'm thinking if the intuniv helps with the doom spirals so much it might counteract the depression the Concerta sets in.

The thing I was most worried about was lessening of feelings/emotions because people talk about that a lot. I think it's misleading, because I still have all of my feelings but they are no longer distracting me. I don't get sad or annoyed or excited or turned on so much that I can't focus on anything else. Those feelings are still there it's just that I can control them rather than letting them control me.

I see my doctor next week so I'll talk with her about the Concerta and my heart rate but it's going pretty well. It's not a miracle drug but it does help."
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?, I couldn't function for work and had to stop the meds
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,[removed]
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,Does the guanfacine help you with anxiety/panic? Looping/racing thoughts? Does it help you sleep?
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,haven't had a consultation yet
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,"Um like I said those thoughts are still there they just don't drag me down to a dark place. I was panicking about something at work going wrong but it didn't have the same weight it would have had before if that makes sense.

Honestly it's so bizarre because I didn't give looping/racing thoughts a second thought. Until you said it I didn't realize that that had lessened. I'm trying to think of the last thought loop I was stuck in and I honestly can't think of it. I know I've been stuck on things before  to the point of repeating a word or a phrase over and over, that wasn't frequent for me but it did happen and now I can't think of the last time it did.

This drug is so weird because you don't notice things that slip away, like racing thoughts, or like doom spirals, or anything, they just quietly slip away like they never existed and you don't really notice it until someone asks you to think about it.

As for sleep, I'm not sure if it helps or hurts, I try to stick to a schedule so I can sleep and it's still OK. Could be better."
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,Thank you for answering my questions. I’ve been going back and forth on whether or not I should try this. I’ve tried propranolol and Clonidine and both gave me such terrible side effects that I couldn’t keep taking them. Hoping guanfacine is better since it’s more selective and tends to have less side effects.
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,"Thanks for your replies :) I'm on day 8 now. Had to switch to taking them at night because they made me so drowsy during the day, I had accidental long naps on the first 3 days 😅"
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,[deleted]
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,"what did propranolol do and also separately, what did clonidine do to you?"
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,"I am!

It's to the point where I honestly can't tell what it's doing ya know? I can't remember what it was like before I had it and what it might be like without it.

I'm in the phase where I'm wondering what it would be like if I stopped. Even though I know I can't do that because its probably working even though it's not obvious anymore.

So nothing really exciting to share. Maybe I'll realize it's actually doing what it should soon. This summer has been very hectic and extra stressful so it's hard to say."
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,I’m starting this medication this weekend and I’m a little worried about weight gain. I gained almost 40lbs on Prozac and I’m switching to this. Did it make you gain weight? Or have you stayed the same?
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,"I've been at the same weight for about a year, so I don't think it affects weight."
Adult Guanfacine ER(Intuniv) experience?,"That’s good to hear, thank you!"

Tried guanfacine (Intuniv)? Please tell me what you think,"I have ADHD, Anxiety, Depression and PTSD. I have a history of alcoholism. I also take Wellbutrin and Vibrid (sp?)

I started 1mg last Tuesday 3/26 at 8PM for the first time in my life. I knocked out to sleep within the first 20 minutes of my 1st dose. The best nights of sleep I’ve had in months.

Wednesday morning, I woke up without brain fog. I was rather mellow. No physical anxiety symptoms. I still had a panic attack and melted down later that evening due to a trigger. .

Thursday morning, I woke up without brain fog. I was rather mellow.  No physical anxiety symptoms. I had a meltdown due to another trigger. It was resolved within an hr when it typically takes hours.

Friday morning, I woke up without brain fog. I was rather mellow.  No physical anxiety symptoms. I was able to think logically due to the racing thoughts stopping. I was able to manage another trigger well enough to prevent a meltdown or panic attack. It was a good day.

This morning, I woke up without brain fog. I’m rather mellow.  No physical anxiety symptoms. I was able to clean my bedroom for the first time in over a month. I can stay still while I’m typing this to you. It’s a good day. :) 

Needless to say, this has been the best meditation I have taken in my life. I never knew what it was like to function with a clear mind, without racing thoughts, and not overstimulated as easily. I will be bumped to 2mg on Monday. 

I’ll come back later with an update. :)

Good luck to you!"
Tried guanfacine (Intuniv)? Please tell me what you think,"I tried Guanfacine ER in addition to the Adderall XR I was already taking. I experienced side effects of constipation and countered that successfully with a daily probiotic. I was instructed to take it at bedtime but asked if I could take it in the morning because I am not reliable with consistently taking meds at night. I was told I could so long as it doesn’t make me drowsy or fatigued. Guanfacine ER helps with my emotional dysregulation/rejection sensitivity which is what I was hoping for when trying it. It unexpectedly helps significantly with insomnia.  
  
I wouldn’t say the drug isn’t worth bothering to try, but as a general rule I don’t make drug recommendations."

Tried guanfacine (Intuniv)? Please tell me what you think,"I have been on 1mg Guanfacine ER for a lil over 3 months while in drug treatment and it did me wonders I believe,
(Now I was diagnosed with ADD and NLVD, and tbh I think I'm not truly ADD but NLVD doesn't have any treatment options besides therapy. I think I tricked myself into thinking I needed a stimulant to be functional)
It was kind of the perfect environment to adapt to it, helped me receive and follow suggestions, notice my emotions, acknowledge them and move on with self development.  Notice visual cues and things I would have normally been oblivious to. 
It seems like on this stuff I can decide to do something and then follow thru with what I say no problem. Like I decided to quit smoking and did, got on the patch 
I decided to work out every other day and did, leading to everyday
I decided to do yoga every other day, then everyday, despite weird looks from others
It's a very subtle drug but I feel the changes it's helping me make will be permanent and not the crutch that stimulants provide"

Tried guanfacine (Intuniv)? Please tell me what you think,"Cross commenting this here for anyone looking for info. I believe it answers the questions you asked as well :) 

I’ve been taking this med, 1mg, every night for the past four days, and let me tell you, it has been a complete game changer for me! It’s amazing how quickly I’ve seen results—sometimes I have to check in with myself to make sure I’m not just imagining the changes 🤣. The difference has been incredible! I have had 0 side effects at all, no drowsiness, no sexual side effect, no blood pressure issues. I guess in that sense, I’m lucky, as I’ve seen quite a few people who have had not so great side effects.

Over the weekend, I accomplished so much more than I ever thought possible. I actually did things like used a dish and put it right in the dishwasher, or washed it—what a concept! I got out of bed, made it, brushed my teeth without a second thought, and even tossed my clothes directly into the hamper instead of letting them pile on the floor. I found myself tidying up everywhere I went, and I even washed my car!

It might sound a little over the top, but I promise, I’m not a messy person; it’s just that I’ve always struggled to push myself to tackle tasks I didn’t enjoy. This medication has really flipped a switch in my brain, and now those thoughts don’t even cross my mind anymore. It’s not like oh I’m excited to pick up after myself or excited to wash the car, shit even leaving the house for mundane tasks became an extreme effort. Instead of being excited, or putting things off, I just….did them. I knew I wanted to wash clothes, or didn’t want dishes in the sink, so I just did it.

Honestly, I never expected this kind of impact from the medication, and I wish I’d discovered it 20 years ago! The only other medication I take is Adderall 15mg, which I’ve used since childhood, but this new one has blown it out of the water when it comes to helping with executive dysfunction. I can’t wait to see how this week at work goes!"

Tried guanfacine (Intuniv)? Please tell me what you think,Fatigue is expected initially and should stop happening over time. Your psychiatrist should very slowly titrate up to avoid any severe fatigue. Like 1mg/month.
Tried guanfacine (Intuniv)? Please tell me what you think,"Oof.. 

Just out of curiosity, did you take it at night or on the morning?"
Tried guanfacine (Intuniv)? Please tell me what you think,I have not gained weight on this medication. I actually successfully lost weight due to lifestyle changes and did not feel that the guanfacine was a barrier in that process. Good luck!
Tried guanfacine (Intuniv)? Please tell me what you think,I take it at night which was suggested by my doctor. I have seen many others who prefer it at night!
Tried guanfacine (Intuniv)? Please tell me what you think,"This was helpful! Thank you :) If you had anxiety with your ADHD, did you find it helped you in that regard as well? I deal with a lot of overstimulation issues which leads to panic attacks -\_\_- All nervous system dysfunction stuff"
Tried guanfacine (Intuniv)? Please tell me what you think,"Hi there! 

Sorry for the delay on an update, I’m still taking it and it’s still doing wonders for me. 

Alrighty, I’m currently bumped up to 3mg. The fog is definitely gone at this point. Instead of perhaps 4-6 fleeting thoughts or movements at a time, it’s gone down to 1-2 fleeting thoughts and movements. I don’t think it will fully go away, which is fine. I like that part of my personality. 

I’m not stoic, nor robotic. I’m still myself, bubbly personality & slightly squirrely. I can think clearly enough to notice what’s occurring with physical and mental symptoms of anxiety to help problem solve. The overwhelming ADHD overstimulation has reduced, it takes a lot to overwhelm me. (If my needs are met, no vulnerability) I still will not feel well if I haven’t gotten a good nights sleep or eaten. 

It’s something I would recommend. It may be a combination of all of the medication, such as Wellbutrin. I may bump to 4mg if I find work focus getting difficult. It’s typically taken at night, and will knock you to sleep within a half hour. Which is great, helps with evening anxiety."
Tried guanfacine (Intuniv)? Please tell me what you think,"I was being monitored the first two weeks for BP. At first, it was dropping. We discovered it was due to the combination of this and Propranolol. Stopped that and it returned to average rate. 

I no longer use the propranolol as this handles a good amount of anxiety. Not completely gone, but it’s manageable now."
Tried guanfacine (Intuniv)? Please tell me what you think,"Immediately, but good results built up over 2-3 weeks. Didn't notice anything in mood."
Tried guanfacine (Intuniv)? Please tell me what you think,"I did titrate up slowly and yes I was told that it probably would go away, but the tiredness for me was to brutal"
Tried guanfacine (Intuniv)? Please tell me what you think,How long does it take to go away?
Tried guanfacine (Intuniv)? Please tell me what you think,"I dont really remember actually, I think in the morning, but I’m not sure"
Tried guanfacine (Intuniv)? Please tell me what you think,"Thank you for this update. I am on Vyvanse 30mg and feel like I might want to try this or Wellbutrin in conjunction next. Not sure why I am always so hesitant to try things, maybe because both Wellbutrin and guanfacine stay in your system and have to be taken every day? I don't exactly know what I'm worried about but it's nice to know that there are options other than increasing doses for stimulants, which I'm not sure I want to do.

  
The overwhelm and overstimulation issues are quite big for me still. And that sounds lovely about it helping a touch with fleeting thoughts. I've heard so many good things about Wellbutrin that it's ridiculous I'm still nervous about trying, and this is a blood pressure medication but my blood pressure is within normal range according to my GP. Still kind of makes me want to try both eventually - one at a time to see what the effects are of either. Anyway! Hearing other people's expeirences helps a lot so thank you for coming back to share!"
Tried guanfacine (Intuniv)? Please tell me what you think,still going well for you? I might start taking this as strattera has raised my heart rate quite a bit

Tried guanfacine (Intuniv)? Please tell me what you think,"For me personally, it was almost imperceptible the whole time. I’d say it took maybe a week or two for any figment of fatigue to completely wear off? I don’t remember very well though"
Tried guanfacine (Intuniv)? Please tell me what you think,"Most definitely! I’ve been bumped to 5mg and it will remain my dose. It’s taken along with Wellbutrin and Viibryd. 1mg in the am to help with evening.

I didn’t enjoy Strattera as well."
Tried guanfacine (Intuniv)? Please tell me what you think,ER
Tried guanfacine (Intuniv)? Please tell me what you think,"Correct, ER. I’m presently on my set dosage of medications. 4mg evening and 1mg in the morning. Im very happy with this set up and works well for my life functioning."
Tried guanfacine (Intuniv)? Please tell me what you think,Guanfacine worked best for the fog in my experience.
Tried guanfacine (Intuniv)? Please tell me what you think,"Everyone is different. Talk it over with your dr, clondidine is the other one. Give it time and know that being tired is part of it until you get use to it and even then, I am tired, but it helps my brain. Best person to know is you. :)"
Tried guanfacine (Intuniv)? Please tell me what you think,Cool thanks :)
Guanfacine as an adult - what are your experiences?,"Update from me...

For the first time I got what others were talking about : a kind of clarity.  I don't really like that analogy because it doesn't help people with no experience of it...I get that now.

And that's not necessarily a good thing.

It's not clarity because there's no fog.  What it _is_ is my thoughts being changed from nervous, always-looking-over-their-shoulder, kind of like something like a meerkat might be, to a cold-focused-surety.  Like my thoughts have an iron core that I can grip, that has strength. More like an elephant that takes no crap - it doesn't recognise the meerkat.

The difference is between thoughts that always seem to be on the alert to be wrong, or for the next thing, or just ready for fight or flight versus concrete.

So why is it not a good thing?  Because it was fleeting.  About 1 hours worth after my first (1mg) dose, and hasn't reappeared since.  It gives me hope, and it's a feeling I _remember_ having, but decades ago.  It also reminds me how far away from that I actually am.

Going from 2mg to (hopefully) 4mg next week, so I'll update as and when."
Guanfacine as an adult - what are your experiences?,So I’m in 2mg and have been for a month now. Helped my mood and drowsiness alot and has given me the energy to do things I previously felt impossible like social situations and crowds. One thing it hasn’t helped with is organization of thoughts. I’ll still go into a room 5 times and not do what I went in there for and will put things off until the last minute. Should I go for upping my dose or looking into an additional stimulant? Adderall made me very stressed out so I’m a little worried all stimulants will do that
Guanfacine as an adult - what are your experiences?,"I’m 8 days into taking it. My doc said to take it at bedtime because it also treats anxiety, which can cause serious drowsiness. Whelp…haven’t slept all night. Day 10 I’m suppose to double the dose.

Is it too soon to try to take it in the morning instead?"

I’ll keep you updated, good luck :)"

Guanfacine as an adult - what are your experiences?,How has it been after a month?  My doc just started me on it today.
Guanfacine as an adult - what are your experiences?,"Obviously ""not a doctor"",  but I'd try a different stimulant.  Ritalin did nothing for me, Elvanse/Dextroamphetamine does a lot.  What have you got to lose?"
Guanfacine as an adult - what are your experiences?,Any luck with some changes or sticking to the Guanfacine?
Guanfacine as an adult - what are your experiences?,"No!

I'm on day 8 or 9.  Doc told me to take it on the morning, _but_ of it made me drowsy to take it at night.

I think it would be reasonable that it would apply to you too?"
Guanfacine as an adult - what are your experiences?,I’m having the same experience… day three and a very hard time sleeping. I feel extremely anxious and have really intense stomach pain and diarrhea one night. It’s almost like a panic attack…. But less freak out I guess. Like a calm panic attack. Has anyone had an experience with this?
Guanfacine as an adult - what are your experiences?,"Have a look at [this article ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4706844/#!po=6.36792).  Methylphenidate (MPH) is one of the most studied co-medications (called combination therapy), so there's a _lot_ to read on there.  I found it hugely informative."

Guanfacine as an adult - what are your experiences?,Apparently guanfacine and beer don’t mix. You may have an extended hangover.
Guanfacine as an adult - what are your experiences?,Elvanse/ Vyvanse is amazing for Anxiety for me.
Guanfacine as an adult - what are your experiences?,"So it's been over a month - I'm now on 4mg/day.

I think it's getting better.  I think I prefer it to straight Vyvanse & top up stimulant.

__ But__ I think I'm an edge case, or at least not quite ordinary, even in non-normal circles.  I'm going to ask for another bump in Guanfacine dosage, and also a top up Dexamphetamine, albeit smaller than before.  I'm now noticing the Vyvanse crash more than before, and it seems to hit much harder too. At 7pm on the dot I could fall asleep every day.  Unfortunately I'm still at work then, and with a 100 mile drive home - that has caused a few extended naps in car parks.

I really notice when I'm not on meds now (forget to take them), so they must be doing more than before!  Plus when the 'crash' _does_ come it's actually helpful.  If I don't take my meds it feels like I sleep worse as my mind just _won't_ shut up and then I won't go to bed as it'll wake the wife with me tossing and turning, but if  not in bed then I end up doing something, anything, and then I'm distracted and don't notice time and it's 4am and I'm still not tired... 🤯🤌🫣🤷🤦"
Guanfacine as an adult - what are your experiences?,I ended up switching to concerta which has been really good for me :)
Guanfacine as an adult - what are your experiences?,How has it been effecting you in the mornings? Does it make you drowsy through the day or no?
Guanfacine as an adult - what are your experiences?,"Yup, no drowsiness, no side effects. Every medication I've taken makes me wake up at night, even vyvanse, however at 20mg it's fine and doesn't keep me up. Which is weird because I'd assume guanfacine wouldn't do that, I'll try it at night and hope it goes away because the medication is great for me."
Guanfacine as an adult - what are your experiences?,"I asked him xD 

(I'm seeing a psychiatrist btw, and doctors here can't prescribe it because Ireland's healthcare system is still stuck in medieval times apparently, doctors here are also severely under-trained to deal with ADHD, my psych told me he'd have patients that come in that never even got to try half the things I did because doctors refuse to prescribe them, which is a joke in itself - I'm fortunate to have a better GP than most)

Also like I mentioned, I couldn't sleep on any other medication.

Ritalin was fine, I didn't like the sharp start and stop feeling of it working or not. It's OK and it's super cheap.

Concerta xr gave me heart palpitations no matter the dose, wasn't a fun time, stopped very quickly.

Atomoxetine was OK, again sleep issues, and some other urinary issues too, it felt like there wasn't enough pressure for me to pee at a normal pace and Id pee slower because of it. I stopped because I didn't sleep properly for 2.5 months. 

I was getting irritable from lack of sleep etc. All of these things made me pull the plug. My GP prescribed me sleeping pills I said I'm not going to depend on sleeping medication because of Atomoxetine. (good thing I didn't, once I recovered from lack of sleep and read up on cognitive side effects of long-term use of sleeping pills I shit myself) 

Guanfacine sleep issues are different, yes I wake up more often than not, but, I'll fall back asleep more often than not. Long-term this isn't good because you/I need prolonged uninterrupted sleep. However, I still feel rested. So I'm hoping this goes away.

Vyvanse gave me no side effects besides sleep issues, what it does is help with establishing a solid baseline, it has a consistent effect, Ritalin and Concerta don't work like that. However, even on Vyvanse I still don't care to move regardless, it helps with some things. 

Such as I was able to finally start exercising regularly but work and video games were still a drag. I want to work or play games, but I've no appetite for them.

Guanfacine enhances stimulant effects (as a side note), it was the missing piece for me. (I read research on it and thought it was what I needed, and I was right) 

I can just work when I want or need to, I can play games when I want to, I can stop when I want to etc, I have got an easier time pulling thoughts out of my head especially in more cognitively challenging conversations, albeit this may be an autistic trait, I'm getting assessed for that too soon.

Having said that, and guanfacine sleep issues aside, it works better on its own than Vyvanse would on its own for me, however, I can take both and have great results from it (especially since that I'm on a low dose of Vyvanse and have no interest in taking more), minus the sleep issues from guanfacine as of now ofc. My insurance (which I pay for) covers the cost and I'm saving money regardless. 

The biggest thing about this combo is I feel the same, it's very subtle and works, I don't feel overconfident like I did on Atomoxetine or head over heels happy as I did or Ritalin before I'd crash.. 

Hope this answers your question more or less."
Guanfacine as an adult - what are your experiences?,"Yeah that could be true because I woke up the next morning feeling like a new man without even getting that great of a nights rest…it’s just I felt amazing in contrast to the “extended hangover” feeling…And now id say the guanfacine is working great on Day 7. I do have some fucking gnarly stomach aches tho, so that’s no fun. I’ll keep going with it because I got nothing to lose and the mental effects are awesome, but I’ll have to stop if stomach aches remain as shitty as they are currently"
Guanfacine as an adult - what are your experiences?,how long did it take you to start to notice the benefits of the guanfacine?
Guanfacine as an adult - what are your experiences?,"Be very cautious with guanfacine, it is a med originally meant to influence your cardiovascular system after all. It gave me super slow heartbeat and VERY low blood pressure in higher doses and started to negatively affect the effectiveness of Vyvanse too."
Guanfacine as an adult - what are your experiences?,Did you stop taking the guanfacine?
Guanfacine as an adult - what are your experiences?,"That's actually a lot harder to answer than I would like.  For any number of a dozen reasons either,  singly or combined, I'm rubbish at sleeping. Whether that's due to ADHD, work pressure, whatever, I rarely get more than between 3 and 4 and 1/2 hours sleep per night.

That makes your question much more difficult.  It's very possible that when I am feeling tired or sleepy, or my eyes want to close, that could be by natural as I'm not really getting enough sleep, it could be a a by-product of me not being on a second dose of stimulants per day, it could be be that the effectiveness of the medication in making me less anxious etc actually has the effect of of allowing me to be tired if that makes sense.

Long story short I think I am feeling more tired now when I am in meds, but I don't know if I can put it down to the Guanfacine. Although, when I remember, which is 30 to 60% of the time, I do try to take the Guanfacine at night, about 10pm, just in case.

On balance I think that I I'm choosing to act as though it does make me sleepy, because why not? It's actually a question I didn't ask at the time, although the thought did run through my head, which is is why shouldn't the standard practice be to take the Guanfacine  at night if it doesn't act like a stimulant?  Is there a mechanism that I don't know or wasn't explained to me?

Sorry my friend, I wish I could make it simpler it clearer, but at least with this but of brain-fart you may at least be able to set a benchmark for yourself.

Hope something in that ramble is useful to ya!

Love and Lard,
The Captain"
Guanfacine as an adult - what are your experiences?,I’m glad to hear you’re having some positive results. 👏🏼
Guanfacine as an adult - what are your experiences?,"That's the weird/annoying thing with Guanfacine, at least for me:. I kind of don't notice it.  It doesn't work like the normal stimulants for me.  It doesn't have the obvious up and down/ on and off effect.  I couldn't tell you that it's obvious if I have or haven't taken it.  It doesn't shout like stimulants, it doesn't even whisper.  It's just there, and you didn't know it was doing something until it's been gone for a while.  I can't really explain it.

BUT, If you were to force me to give an answer then I'd say that it would likely take me a few days to notice at my current dose, and probably a couple of weeks on the lower amounts.  Its effect is that it just makes me slightly more able to be/do what I should be doing, which is then self-reinfocing in a virtuous circle."
Guanfacine as an adult - what are your experiences?,"do you struggle with hyperactivity? if so, does it help with that?"
Guanfacine as an adult - what are your experiences?,"Um, not sure.  I'm combined type, so I guess so.  I'm sure my wife would say so!  I don't feel like it personally, but I guess I do get excited at certain things in a 'not very adult' kind of way.  But I don't think of myself as a very adulty-adult anyway.  

Honestly I don't know if I could put my finger on what _exactly_ it helps with because I'm also taking 70mg Vyvanse with it.  From what I've gathered it basically has the effect of making the Vyvanse work better for longer at a lower dose.  The fact I'm still on 70mg should tell you something - about me, not the Guanfacine!"
Adderall + Guanfacine = GOAT,Really happy to hear man! I myself moved from concerta to vyvanse and holy shit the difference was insane I too have never felt this put together and calm and productive it feels like all the wool in your brain is gone And I can finally be me!! hoping it keeps working for you friend :)
Adderall + Guanfacine = GOAT,Smiling so big reading this. My prescription for guanfacine was sent to Walgreens to add to my adderall.

Adderall + Guanfacine = GOAT,"I just started taking it last night (I take 40 vyvanse during the day) and I’m excited to see how it goes. How long would you say it took to see any positive effects?

Adderall + Guanfacine = GOAT,"What dose of guanfacine are you currently on? I'm at 2 mg currently,  I'm definitely liking it as an adjunct to my adderall dose.

Adderall + Guanfacine = GOAT,"Any sexual side-effects? I’m currently on adderall and would like to try this as an add-on for ameliorating elevated blood pressure & anxiety, but I’m worried the A2 agonism would mess with erection quality.

Adderall + Guanfacine = GOAT,Do you take it in the morning or night. How long did it take to work?
Adderall + Guanfacine = GOAT,Any other side effects other than insomnia?
Adderall + Guanfacine = GOAT,"I’m super late to this thread, but I figured I’d let you know it gave me some hope today! I had a similar experience with Adderall on its own due to being an ultrarapid CYP2D6 metabolizer, i.e., my brain blows through 15-20mg of Adderall IR in 2 hours. The last few months have been absolute hell trying to find an alternative that plays nicely with my various psych and neuro meds. I also have daily migraines with chronic fatigue, depression, anxiety, and PTSD, so there’s a whole mess of stuff going on in there. Dexedrine worked for a short while and then did almost nothing, Vyvanse absolutely wrecked me (I suspect in part because the dose was too low), Ritalin and Focalin were unpredictable and awful, Strattera made my limbs tingle, and half a dose of Provigil put me to sleep for 1.5 days. Concerta actually did an ok job of slowing down my brain, but it did nothing at all for my fatigue, so I was basically laser focused on the inside of my eyelids all day.

It’s been hard not to give up hope. Switching back to Adderall has helped me get back to a mostly functional fatigue level, but the mood boost, improved working memory, focus, and clarity are gone. I’m starting guanfacine tonight. I’ve been nervous about it, but your post makes me feel more optimistic. Thanks for sharing your experience."
Adderall + Guanfacine = GOAT,Been on adderall since 6th grade & the efficacy has progressively node dived. I'm pretty sure I'm only on anti depressants bc of the anxiety/depression of inadequately controlled ADHD symptoms. REALLY hope my psych will let me try this!!!

Then to Vyvanse and concerta. Both have me pigging out in the evening (which is ironic for Vyvanse that is promoted for binge eating).

Adderall + Guanfacine = GOAT,"Glad I found this post man! Our stories are identical. Started Adderall about a year ago, and its been life changing. I also deal with generalized anxiety, work in a high stress job as a healthcare exec, and have noticed the Adderall just not feeling like it did when I first started taking it. I'm on 20mg ER in the morning and 5 IR in the afternoon, and I really don't want to increase my dose. About 6 months ago my Dr. put me on Wellbutrin as well, and it was absolutely terrible. I was moody, anxious, on edge, couldn't sleep, and I was almost a little hypomanic for the 6 weeks I was on it. Fast forward 6 months and my Dr. just prescribed Guanfacine. Super excited reading about this working for someone that's had a very similar experience! I'm super curious about the genetic test you took and might have to look into it. With how Wellbutrin hit me in such a similar way I'm curious about that gene. I've tried other SSRIs over the years, tried Ketamine treatments, and everything other than the Adderall has made my baseline significantly worse. Fingers crossed on the Guanfacine, and hopefully this is still helping you 5 months later!"
Adderall + Guanfacine = GOAT,"I know this is old, but it's an interesting post. I'm actually val/val (opposite of you), but I had a similar experience with Wellbutrin. Really awful. I'm sensitive to stimulant meds too. I'm going to ask my dr for guanfacine at my next appointment and very excited to try it. The quiet without the buzzy/speedy euphoria is exactly what I need too. I don't need to feel like I'm at a rave when I'm trying to get work done.

Are you still doing well on it? Do you take both guanfacine and adderall? 

By the way, if you haven't tried dexedrine, it feels more quiet and less speedy than adderall as well. Still an amphetamine with all the associated problems, but might be a little better for you than adderall if you haven't tried it yet."
Adderall + Guanfacine = GOAT,"Very similar experience here! Sleep is so much better, it’s actually enjoyable to go to bed, lay there and feel the rest kick in and thoughts leave my brain and fall into a restful sleep. Never ever had that before. I wake up well rested too, no grogginess. Plus just generally feeling so much better during the day. Less racing thoughts, ability to choose how to respond to the many triggers I encounter during the day, less anxious, …. I combine it with 27mg Concerta XR. Might also try to take it alone once I have established the right dose (now at 1mg 2 wks in, but seems that the effect are a little less now then in the beginning so might up to 2mg). I do feel that working memory is not positively affected, might even be slightly negatively affected (I seem to find myself in situations where I have no clue wtf I was doing once again, while on just Concerta that did not happen anymore.

I sometimes do still have a little come down anxiety but I manage that with non prescription means. (Can't be more specific against sub rules and my last comment was removed)

Best of luck fwiw Vyvanse was terrible for me and I struggled on it. Really any delayed release ADHD meds have never worked for me (including Adderall xr)"
Adderall + Guanfacine = GOAT,I’m on about week one. How’s it going for you?
Adderall + Guanfacine = GOAT,How has Guanfacine been for you?
Adderall + Guanfacine = GOAT,"Purely anecdotal tho as everyone responds differently but compared to methylphenidate (Concerta it’s far better for me all I deal with is dry mouth and some appetite issues but that’s pretty easy to fix imo.

Didn’t have the rushy feeling from concerta just a smooth focus, I feel calm and collected while with concerta I felt emotionless and hyper-fixated and had some bad headaches and stomach aches worst of all was an intense crash for me on concerta, vyvanse works the whole day for me and when it wears off all I feel is a little sleepy not emotional"
Adderall + Guanfacine = GOAT,I do like it! It has lowered my bp enough to where I feel my anxiety isn’t through the roof. And it has 100% impacted my deep sleep at night having more restful sleep!
Adderall + Guanfacine = GOAT,"It's actually an agonist of the a2a receptor. It's counter-intuitive. You'd expect that a receptor norepinephrine binds to would be pro-adrenergic, right? Turns out the a2a receptor, when activated, actually slows the release of norepinephrine. In other words, it acts like a natural limiter/braking system for norepinephrine."
Adderall + Guanfacine = GOAT,[deleted]
Adderall + Guanfacine = GOAT,"First week I was on 1mg and was I was a little tired but felt like better emotionally. Though my sleep was weird and I had some crazy nightmares.    

Second week I was on 2mg and kinda the same thing, just elevated a bit. But I was getting accustomed to it and not really getting sleepy - and the nightmares went away. Though my sleep was a little wonky still.    

Third week I bumped to 3mg and made it like five days before I went back down to 2 lol. I already had lower end blood pressure and 3 was making me feel like I was genuinely gonna pass out when I’d stand up. And my hands were getting tingly / numb. I was a little loopy on it, my mouth was insatiably dry, and I think it was more than I needed realistically.     

I think I do overall like the effects of the drug. My focus and ability to complete tasks are better. For a little I thought I was maybe… too focused? Like hyper focus intensified. I am mostly inattentive so that wasn’t necessarily a bad thing, but it seemed my ability to shift away from a task was a lot different. My emotional range does seem better though, and I’m (I think) more rational and level headed with my thought patterns.    

With that said, I’m actually about to start trying to take it in the morning instead of at night. I think once the initial drowsiness period passed I’ve found it’s giving me energy (I’ve felt more tired during the day alert at night) so, hopefully that works out! Thanks for coming to my Ted talk lol"
Adderall + Guanfacine = GOAT,That’s awesome what dose are you on? I have gad/panic/adhd! Did it help your anxiety out a lot?
Adderall + Guanfacine = GOAT,Yeah totally. I have read about dry mouth and headache too. My mind is in overdrive with overthinking everything so hoping it helps ease that too. But I do think the adhd/panic/anxiety/overthinking all goes hand in hand so praying that it works. Thanks for all your comments much appreciated
Adderall + Guanfacine = GOAT,"Thanks for asking! I haven’t really settled in yet, but there’s a definite improvement. It’s a million times easier to stay calm. My therapist put it into words really well: “You have time to regulate your emotions before you start trying to problem solve. Stopping activities has been somewhat easier, though it varies from day to day.

The only real issue I’m noticing is that my energy is unpredictable. I had to stop taking my insomnia med (Quviviq) because taking both before bed made me feel super sleepy all day, even with Adderall. I had a few good days after that, but I think my sleep being thrown off has slowly made the guanfacine less effective at managing my executive dysfunction. It’s hard to tell because fatigue + ExD usually manifests (for me) as “I’m too tired to move so I can do the thing” rather than “I’m just not getting up to do the thing” (also part of why I was diagnosed so late).

The other thing that makes it hard to tell is that Adderall can be hit or miss for me with ADHD symptoms and fatigue. The effects are variable enough that I’ll probably need a larger than usual sample size to determine what’s guanfacine and what’s just my body’s weird shit du jour + Adderall not doing its thing. It’s a bit of a crapshoot whether I’ll feel like a human or just I’m be to stay awake, and feel like most people feel after a long day. At least I’m calm and sleepy! I’ll probably also know more as I titrate up. I’m taking it slow because increasing from 1mg to 2mg made me suuuuper sleepy. I scaled back for now because I have a big weekend of work stuff, and I’m still calm and sleepy, but I don’t feel like I need to take a nap constantly. I’m going to try again next week, but I think I’ll take it earlier in the evening instead of at bedtime. I’m curious to hear if anyone else takes it at a different time. I’ve come across the odd mention here or there, but I haven’t found much detail."
Adderall + Guanfacine = GOAT,"Week one went alright. Week two was terribly tiring, now at 3mg I feel okayish but I also feel that it´s slowing me down. I will either keep on using 3 mg or shift back to 1mg which was okay. Best benefit is the sleep quality and probably a slight anxiety improvement otherwise once I take the medication at night I pass out"
Adderall + Guanfacine = GOAT,"I’m confused, which one works better for you, concerta or Vyvanse?"
Adderall + Guanfacine = GOAT,Yeah sorry I always get agonist and antagonist mixed up. It basically binds to the same receptor as norepinephrine and then downregulates the release of it while also strengthening processing over time via growing more dendritic spines.
Adderall + Guanfacine = GOAT,Yep it was in promethease I used a 23 and me test and uploaded it there. https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/COMT
Adderall + Guanfacine = GOAT,Yeah was a revolution for my GAD/panic. TBH it's the biggest thing it helped which gives me the space to focus. I responded well to 1mg IR but I'm likely going to go up to 2mg.
Adderall + Guanfacine = GOAT,How’s it going… now? 😅
Adderall + Guanfacine = GOAT,Sorry! autocorrect Vyvanse by a mile
Adderall + Guanfacine = GOAT,That’s exactly what I want it to do for me. I started 1mg er this morning. I also have health/medication anxiety when starting something new so that doesn’t help either.

Do guanfacine side effects ever go away?,"I got constipation starting at 2mg of Guanfacine ER, like some of the worst I ever had. I started taking a probiotic every day and it’s been smooth sailing ever since, even after being bumped up to 3mg."
Do guanfacine side effects ever go away?,"I take magnesium at night to help. I also added in fish oil. The med is amazing. I am staying on it period. I will figure out the rest, even like you if I end up taking a week break or so. Will consider adding in trace minerals and/or digestive enzymes if need be. I did talk to my dr so we are on the same page."
Do guanfacine side effects ever go away?,"I never got that as a side effect... only CRAZY dry mouth and low blood pressure. Both never went away, so I discontinued guanfacine after 10 months.

The dry mouth caused 3 cavities in the span of less than a year, whereas I've only had 1 cavity in the last 20 years previously. Definitely not worth it for me."
Do guanfacine side effects ever go away?,"I found that after 1-2 months my 1mg guanfacine has kind of worn off the mental help of better focus, but my blood pressure is better and I am less stressed. It was helping w/ my brain fog feeling, but not so much now. I am seeing my doc next week to see if I should take more, or try something else for a boost. Its my first med I have tried to help w/ focus issues."
Do guanfacine side effects ever go away?,Hey! How’s it going for you? I’m in the same position so keen to hear your experience
Do guanfacine side effects ever go away?,Can I ask which probiotic? Does the constipation go away when you stop guanfacine
Do guanfacine side effects ever go away?,"Thanks! I thought kombucha would cover me, I'll add it to my gut health regimen"
Do guanfacine side effects ever go away?,"Unfortunately I stopped taking them 🥲 At around 6 weeks - 2 months of taking guanfacine the constipation got so bad I lost my appetite, so I was lightheaded all the time, which I felt like cancelled out any cognitive benefit I was getting from the meds. Plus, very coincidentally, I'm in medical school currently in my GI course and we were learning about SIBO, it made me super paranoid lol"
Do guanfacine side effects ever go away?,"Phillips’ Colon Health Daily Probiotic is what I use, but I’m open to trying whatever is on sale. I haven’t stopped the Guanfacine since I started, but my normal was closer to the looser end of the scale, so I’d imagine that’s where I’d end up if I stopped both the Guanfacine and the probiotic."
Do guanfacine side effects ever go away?,"Oh no! Sorry to hear that. I stopped in the end as well 🥲 
Can it cause SIBO then? So frustrating as I never found any way to resolve the constipation"
Do guanfacine side effects ever go away?,"Funny you mention this, I got SIBO from guanfacine because no one told me that the semi chronic constipation I was experiencing could become a real health issue. Like you guanfacine has been life changing in many ways, but honestly not worth the health difficulties I’m going through now.

I’m going to explore taking a prokinetic with it to see if I can counter balance the side effects, but it’s absolutely a very real consequence.

I’m so glad to hear you are learning about SIBO in medical school- so many providers have been uninformed about it in my experience so far. Gives me hope about the future 🙂"
Do guanfacine side effects ever go away?,Thank you! How long was you on guanfacine before you started the probiotic?
Do guanfacine side effects ever go away?,"Yes, in that anything that causes bowel stasis can also cause SIBO (although I'm sure it would necessitate months of chronic constipation in order to develop a significant enough overgrowth). Sorry to hear about your own troubles!! Hoping for the both of us we find our miracle drug soon 🤞"
Do guanfacine side effects ever go away?,"I'm so sorry that happened to you, I can't imagine how scary it was!

Please let me know how the prokinetic helps, I'd really like to start taking it again but I just can't justify it right now. 

And wow, I'm honestly quite shocked your providers weren't better informed. I consider it a pretty basic GI diagnosis to know about, but it's not the first time my classmates and I have been shocked by the incompetency of older doctors. I promise the pedagogy of medical school is completelyyy different now, the new generation of doctors will truly be something special :)"
Do guanfacine side effects ever go away?,Somewhere between 1-2 months. I started at 1mg for one month and the problem started after increasing the dose to 2mg. After addressing the issue with the probiotic I went to 3mg and stayed there since.
Do guanfacine side effects ever go away?,"Thank you ❤️ I’m glad that the next generation of doctors include awesome people like you!

Unfortunately I still have SIBO- have tried Rifaximin twice and it hasn’t been enough to get rid of it. Now to be fair, I took guanfacine for over a year with noticeable motility issues, so it had some time to really build up. Taking guanfacine in the morning instead of before bed seems to also help a little.

I’d be happy to update you if I’m able to stay on guanfacine, I really want to as it’s been life changing! Also please let me know if you find something similar or go back on with success 🙂"
Do guanfacine side effects ever go away?,Ah thanks. I get severely constipated on 1mg :( not sure where to go from here as the medication is life changing for my adhd
Do guanfacine side effects ever go away?,"Don’t hesitate to discuss the issue with your doctor. I’d presume constipation is a treatable side effect one way or another, even if a probiotic isn’t the right answer for you. Best of luck."
Do guanfacine side effects ever go away?,Thank you! Sadly they suggested to stop the guanfacine :(
Do guanfacine side effects ever go away?,Hey! Sorry for the random question but did you ever try laxatives like movicol for the constipation?
Do guanfacine side effects ever go away?,"I did not. Probiotic was my first instinct and it worked for me, and I’d rather take a probiotic than laxatives."

Guanfacine for adults??,"I was prescribed guanfacine for ptsd and sleep. I had no negative side effects, though it did slightly lower my BP. I’m surprised it’s not approved for adults with adhd, but it is approved for adults for other purposes so I wouldn’t let that scare you."
Guanfacine for adults??,Looks like it’s used for adults to me? https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2013/022037s009lbl.pdf
Guanfacine for adults??,It’s amazing. I love being on it. It takes away the physical restlessness.
Guanfacine for adults??,"Cross posting this here in hopes it’s helpful. Found the thread while googling and I’m sure others will too :) 

I’ve been taking this med, 1mg, every night for the past four days, and let me tell you, it has been a complete game changer for me! It’s amazing how quickly I’ve seen results—sometimes I have to check in with myself to make sure I’m not just imagining the changes 🤣. The difference has been incredible! I have had 0 side effects at all, no drowsiness, no sexual side effect, no blood pressure issues. I guess in that sense, I’m lucky, as I’ve seen quite a few people who have had not so great side effects.

Over the weekend, I accomplished so much more than I ever thought possible. I actually did things like used a dish and put it right in the dishwasher, or washed it—what a concept! I got out of bed, made it, brushed my teeth without a second thought, and even tossed my clothes directly into the hamper instead of letting them pile on the floor. I found myself tidying up everywhere I went, and I even washed my car!

It might sound a little over the top, but I promise, I’m not a messy person; it’s just that I’ve always struggled to push myself to tackle tasks I didn’t enjoy. This medication has really flipped a switch in my brain, and now those thoughts don’t even cross my mind anymore. It’s not like oh I’m excited to pick up after myself or excited to wash the car, shit even leaving the house for mundane tasks became an extreme effort. Instead of being excited, or putting things off, I just….did them. I knew I wanted to wash clothes, or didn’t want dishes in the sink, so I just did it.

Honestly, I never expected this kind of impact from the medication, and I wish I’d discovered it 20 years ago! The only other medication I take is Adderall 15mg, which I’ve used since childhood, but this new one has blown it out of the water when it comes to helping with executive dysfunction. I can’t wait to see how this week at work goes!"
Guanfacine for adults??,"I was on guanfacine a few years ago when I was close to your age and in college. I didn't notice any difference until one day about 2-3 weeks after starting it, and I realized I was sitting down and consistently making quality progress on homework for hours. At that point in my life, I had never been prescribed controlled stimulants for ADHD, so guanfacine was the most helpful medication I'd ever been on.

The impact did trail off several months later, though, and I didn't ever feel the same symptom relief as those early days even after upping my dosage. I didn't have any negative health side effects whatsoever, so I hope that helps ease your health anxiety a bit. Overall it was a very helpful short-term medication for me, but eventually I got off it simply because I didn't feel like it gave me the symptom relief I needed after a while."
Guanfacine for adults??,"I was started on guanfacine and started tapering off adderall about 4 weeks ago due to concerns about my blood pressure. I was definitely a little more tired the first few days so it primarily impacted workout regimen a bit (currently in marathon training so YMMW (pun intended), but I evened out after about a week. 

So far I’ve found it actually works really well for my executive function issues, but not as well for focus as adderall. On the plus side, I feel more calm and even-keeled which has been a nice feeling. 

Other than the fatigue early on, I may have gained a little weight? But it’s hard to tell if it’s directly related to the medication."
Guanfacine for adults??,Was it helpful in treating your symptoms?
Guanfacine for adults??,"OP might not live in the US. For instance, in Canada guanfacine is only approved for ADHD treatment in children aged 6-17."
Guanfacine for adults??,"That’s interesting you mention that the effect seemed to wear off with Gaunfacine after a few weeks. I just recently started the Extended relief at night and noticed that my distractability had less magnetism, ie. I noticed things but the pull wasn’t as strong, I also noticed that my annoyance/frusteration was a bit less. But I also haven’t really noticed a continual improvement with increasing the dose etc. Which was unlike when I started stimulants which continued to improve. Another benefit I have noticed with Guanfacine is the wearing off symptoms from IR Dex + Vyvanse are less… Still present but less, like the dread/-Ick feeling is a little reduced. I have also slowly introduced coffee back into the picture as the Gaun seems to slow down the caffeine related agitation etc. 

Has anyone else changed their dose of stimulant medication after starting Guanfacine?"
Guanfacine for adults??,"It did. It lowered fight or flight and gave me ‘quiet’ sleep for the first few hours after going to sleep. I had to come off for other reasons so I’m not on it now, but did use it for about a year."
Guanfacine for adults??,I see - you’re right

People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,20 bucks for a months supply? Bitch you trippin 
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"This is another reason why you do not tell people you are on Adderall.

It shouldn't have to be kept secret, but it damnably has to.

I am sorry you went through this."
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"It's probably too late to do anything about it.  But stealing your meds, if she sold them, used them herself, or distributed to any other person, is a felony drug offence.  It's criminal theft regardless.  I'm sorry you have so many idiots in your life.

Only advice I can generally give, the list of people who really need to know you have ADHD is fairly small.  The list of people who need to know anything about your prescription is substantially smaller.  It helps to keep this information more ""need to know""."

People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,[removed]
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"My(39f) mother(Bipolar or bdp narcissist) snorted and shot up my medications when I was growing up. She'd make me fake intense symptoms to the doctor to get increases and tried to swap out the afternoon dose the school nurse got with fake ones. She got a police visit for that one. 

I was being medicated around 4 or 5 years old with Ritalin. But it was rare until I was in Jr high that I got my meds consistently. 

I ended up missing the near entirety of 5th and 6th grade due to my mother's mental health and drug problems. She'd make me stay home with her because she dropped out of school when she was in 6th or 7th grade herself and was jealous of the idea of me getting more than she did. 

Thankfully I moved in with my grandparents and got a routine for the first time in my life.

I now have a bachlors degree and own my own IT firm. Highest level of education or career success anyone in my family has had. 

I've got a lot of CPSTD due to my childhood. I feel guilt and disgust at times due to taking the maximum dosage of adhd meds allowed. I feel like I was tricked into needing them. I see a psychologist every three months and a therapist weekly for the last two years and I still can't shake this feeling I'm faking my ADHD. That I'm a drug addict for needing them. 

I've gone off adhd meds twice for a year or so and both times my life fell apart. Almost flunked out of college and the other time barely held on to my job/could function. 

Even on the maximum dosage (40mg adderal XR atm) I'm struggling with executive function most of the time. I have to get 8 hours of sleep, I have to workout, I have to not eat junk or I just become a mess. I live alone and have no real routine or structure which is a huge part of managing adhd. In my childhood, I never had clean hung up laundry or clean dishes. It was all just dealing with chaos one thing at a time. 

When I do get my kitchen clean, desk cleared, and laundry put up I feel like I can actually breath and think clearly. 

Anyways. Got off on a tangent. 

You need your meds because you need them. Do not share even if you have extras (if you take drug holidays on the weekend)."

People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,I used to have a coworker who was stealing my meds. I kept them in a drawer in my desk.

People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,I’m so lucky and grateful that my family and friends don’t think I’m a  drug addict for needing these meds. I blame drug companies for advertising medications and suggesting people “ask your doctor about [blank]” for giving idiots the idea they know a single fucking thing nowhere else in the developed world are companies allowed to market drugs directly to consumers. We live in a capitalist hellscape
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"Back in freshman year of college, my roommate innocently let slip to another friend (I’ll call him Benny) that I took ADHD meds, and I suddenly had random people coming to my dorm room asking to buy them. One girl even offered to sleep with me just for *two* pills! She was really hot, and the virgin in me really wanted to say yes, but the whole thing felt so wrong, and I declined.

One day senior year, I noticed that my previously full bottle was suddenly almost empty. I knew someone had taken the meds, and asked my housemates one by one if they knew anything, with no luck. I left my closest friend for last, as I knew for a fact he wouldn’t have and had no reason to take them: He reminded me that the night before, a sketchy acquaintance of “Benny” (from Freshman year) had come over asking to buy some of my Adderall. I said no multiple times and he left (I thought). Clearly he had taken the meds, probably right after that, as we were all eating dinner for a while. Thankfully my doctor was cool about it, asked me about my living situation and where I kept my meds and wrote me another Rx, stressing the importance of keeping them hidden/locked up."
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"I’m usually a “don’t call cops unless you absolutely have to” person, but I’d be tempted if someone stole my meds.

People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"O. M. G. 

This makes me never want to tell a single soul about my dx.

One time I had a dog that had severe epilepsy and I had to order his very strong tranquilizer med 6mon at a time, and my bf's friend found out about them, came in our house pretending to be stumbling drunk and flipped open the cupboard where we kept them and knocked a bunch of shit on the floor. We didn't realize until the next day that he took my dogs meds. My dog ended up dying shortly after. 

Gawwwd, people suck."
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,How far back was that theft? Play her and press charges for the robbery and the false statements to the hospital.
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"Oddly enough, when I was in college... everyone and their dog was handing out Adderall for finals. I said no but I kind of regret that. I might have figured all of this out sooner. Lol I just have never been a person to take pills unless I absolutely need to. (Would have been nice to know that was a need to situation). 

However, people wanting to get high or be super focused will earn nothing but ire from me. I know that ADHD is different for everyone, but without my medication...i quite literally cannot function. I cannot get out of bed. I get overwhelmed and I can't do anything from my job to eat to taking care of myself. And some asshole.who just wants to feel high will ask to take that away from me?! No! Money or no money. People without ADHD really take for granted their ability to do simple tasks and just live life. So they can fuck off. 

If someone truly believes that they have ADHD and wants to try something before they go through the process of getting tested, then I'm usually cool with giving them 1 of my 5mg IR boosters I take mid day. Nothing more. (Trusting the person also will help with that decision) I figure it's a safe way for my friend to find out. They also know better than to ask for more. 


I don't have to keep my meds locked up but would if I had to. Your guanfacine thing is genius. Because for me, guanfacine is a booster I take at night to help me sleep and it really helps the Adderall work better. Real ADHD sufferers will understand why that stuff is so freaking gangster. If you are in America and.get script bottles and you have some left over ones for guanfacine, propranolol, or other meds that no one will give a shit about. Hold onto those and put the controlled medication in those bottles to deter people. 


I'm sorry you have to deal with that. Good job with the guanfacine trick!!"

People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"You should have pressed charges on your aunt, and had her drug tested by hair or blood ."
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,I’m more mad at the person wanting an entire month’s supply for just $20. U better add 3 zeros to that.😂😂😂
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,">""hurr durr I'll pay you $20 for your whole Adderall script every month""

like, per pill?"
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,I wouldn’t sell my script for 100 a pill. I need them
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"My brother used to offer me $20/pill when I was in grade school... I didn't do it, but I remember being baffled about why he wanted my meds when I really needed them. Years later, I understand but despise people like that. They're the reason why meds are so hard for us to access in the first place 😪"
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"A, twenty bucks is not nearly enough to cover the cost. I know my Vyvanse is like a hundred a month before insurance, and that's with it being fairly cheap up here in Canada.

And B, to all those assholes who pull this kind of shit, why the hell would we give you our prescriptions (that we need to function as actual human beings) knowing that you're just going to abuse them and contribute to the reputation ADHDers already have as crazy speed addicts? Sorry, but no, it's people like you that give us a bad name.

OP, I'm so sorry your family members did that to you. That's so horrible of them."
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"Yea, I’m not committing a fucking felony for you to have my needed medication."
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"$20? 

People offer me $400 and I still laugh in their face and tell them to go fuck themselves."
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,Nobody seems to want my dermal patches. Would be hard to abuse these even if they tried
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"My ex had a ton of friends come from out of town and stay the weekend a few years ago; one of them had adhd was taking adderall for it. Someone must've found out he took adderall because right before the weekend was out, his script went missing. Luckily he said he had some skipped-days stockpiled just for such occasion but man I felt horrible for him. I'm still angry about it; I got diagnosed this year and I can't imagine losing my supply for the month."
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"i once had a friend lie about being kicked out of her house, stay at mine (because i felt bad and i genuinely thought she had no where else to go), and then proceed to steal my ADHD meds (adderall) and lie about it. i only ended up having it confirmed that she did steal them about a year later when i befriended someone who knew her at the time she stole them. apparently she went around telling people she had to “take her ADHD meds” at concerts and parties. she did not have ADHD btw."
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"If they steal it go to the police. It’s a crime. And by filing a report with the police, you can get your full script early."
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"$20? Bruh I pay $100 a month, pay me at least double that and I can think about it. No meds means I am unable to function, including going to pee on time (I will hold it until I can’t anymore and risk pissing my pants on my way to the bathroom), I’ll get svicidal after a few days, and crippling anxiety will make me basically bedridden. 

And it’s not even that good for getting high??? Or maybe I don’t see it because I do have ADHD but seriously, getting speed on the street would be cheaper. The difference is I basically need it to stay alive, you want it to ki\\ yourself a bit for fun. 

Yeah it boils my blood too.

I had given a few to my best friend tho. Not for fun, he’s also diagnosed with ADHD but his parents are against medication because hurr durr drugs, and he would take them before having a job interview or some other important thing that he didn’t want to zone out on. I was happy to help in his situation, but yeah, people who want them just to get high can go eat their own shite."
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"I'm on meds that people like abuse also, but not Adderall. I've had them stolen out of my purse by strangers while in public and had them stolen from my home by people I thought were my friends. 

It sucks to find out that people you think are decent are truly scumbags. That they do not care that you may suffer because of what they do. 

I spent close to a month barely able to function because I didn't want to get flagged for asking for more. I also knew I'd have to file a police report to be taken seriously and I didn't want to do that for various reasons. 

I now hide my meds and never carry the month supply just in case they are taken again."
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"When I would bring home a random from a bar I used to hide my Adderall in my closet, lol."
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,Luckily no one has ever stole my Adderall and honestly half the time I forget that they are supposed to be controlled because I am not addicted to them. The amount of times I completely forget to take them is insane. But I have had people offer me $20 a pill which is insane. So that means my street value is $1200 as I get 60 pills (twice a day) I nope’d the hell out of that situation. Way too paranoid to ever do that.
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"The real insult is the sheer lowballing!!! 

Sorry that happened to you though! Especially with your aunt. Jesus."
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,$20 for the script??  Not gonna happen … $20 for 1 .. maybe we will talk … honestly I wouldn’t sell it for $50 each lol people are amazing sad!!
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,Yeah I learned the hard way not to tell anyone I am on it. I had one coworker give me a casual “if you ever have any leftovers at the end of the month let me know” and another two asking to buy it off me.
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"I went on a date with a really sketchy guy when I was 18 who, went told I had recently been diagnosed with ADHD, asked for some during the date. Terrible terrible terrible. 

I generally only bring enough on me in case I had forgotten that day. Nobody has asked sincerely since."
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,File a police report saying your aunt stole your meds. Present this to your providers’ offices.
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,My husband had his weekly pill container in his work bag and someone stole it. We had to file a police report to replace seven (!!!!!!!) pills. Like don’t be a crumb.
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"$20?? Try $20 each for Adderall near where live. I know someone who does sell most of her script. Meanwhile, I can't get break thru meds when my Concerta wears off after 10 hours.  But truly....if you're gonna sell....at the very least $15 or $20 each is the going rate. You're smart for saying its something else. People don't have any problem stealing your meds. Never ever keep them in a medicine cabinet. I keep mine hidden in a hot chocolate container."
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,I never tell my friends or anyone that I take adderall.  It’s not worth the risk to be bothered by someone begging for it.
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,You should actually mention Adderall more frequently. Anyone who acts funny gets the boot. Not everyone deserves to spend time around you.
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"I keep my vyvanse in a locked box along with my other controlled substance prescriptions. My doc suggested this and I’ve never had an issue doing it this way. 

I trust my roommates completely but we have friends over often and I keep my bedroom door open while I’m at work at night. Just easier than potentially having to file a police report to get my medication back and going through that whole hassle with my doc. 

Can find one for like $5-10 on Amazon or at Walmart and it’s worth its weight in gold"
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,If you’re in the US I feel like there’s ways you can fight the “abuse” allegations. I think it depends on how much evidence you have against your aunt but it is something that can be done. I’ve had people say they’ve fought hard to get a diagnoses or comment taken off their chart bc it was just wrong. It’s not easy but it’s worth looking into.
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"i gave old ritalin to a friend who also has adhd and cannot afford it- that is the ONLY case where i felt it was ok to give someone meds. other than that nope, youre not getting anything sorry not sorry"

People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"First off, I pay way more than $20 for my monthly supply.  Second, I need them.  Third, I don't like jail."
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"I truly hate people who think they can ask to bum one. Or asking for advice on how to 'fake it' at the doctors. Yeah I faked it 30 years ago when I got diagnosed I just don't remember how. Is basically what I tell them at this point. 
My best advice for anyone, don't disclose your medication. If you are traveling or everyday carrying your medication for work or school ASK YOUR PHARMACY AT EVERY REFILL for a second bottle and label. You can use the label for a ziploc bag and place the doses. That way you don't just have loose medication."
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"Just to add, while I’ve never bought or sold drugs or meds, $20 is more like the cost of a few pills (based on my memory of the going rate when I was in college over 20 years ago) not even close to what people are willing to pay for an entire month’s worth of meds. For many people, $20 would just cover their copay!"
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"Lol, $20 for a months worth of Adderall? That barely covers my copay."
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"You need better friends and family. I have never had a single person ever ask me for my meds in my life, or steal them.  You're surrounded  by shitty people."
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,$20??
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,I know kids who pay 15 bucks a pill (I don’t sell). My roommate is such a fiend he doesn’t even know I have ADHD.
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"My ex did that to me. After a few months of me needing more refills my doc started to think I was abusing them. Especially since I only used them during times of stress so they lasted me a while for all the years prior. Had to sit and tell him about my terrible relationship to keep him from cutting me off. I ended it soon after. 

Like it sucks to not have something you need so that someone else can get high."
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,20$ for a month supply? Kids at school were willing to pay 20 per pills. Obviously I said naw. But that’s wild. Anytime someone asked If say “what pills” “I don’t take pills” and just mind f them. I don’t take ADHD meds anymore rn but when I did I hated when people asked.
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,$20? You can get like $400.
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"A month of my sanity for only $20? Dude, that ain’t gonna pay my bills! 🤣 

I love when im told “well aren’t you supposed to grow out of it? Why do you still need meds?”"
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"Yeah, not at £120 odd a month."
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,This has happened to me and I sued
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,Wow. I’m so glad I don’t have asshole family like that. Yeesh! I hate people like this.
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,I haven’t even told anyone yet that I’ve been prescribe Adderall! I don’t want to be bothered.
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"Only $20??? More like $200+...not even then, though"
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"Annnnnd depending on how my hopeful med change goes, I might be buying a lockbox.  
And $20?! Really?!"
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,Yeah this is why I keep my meds hidden and it a secret. It makes me feel guilty and like I'm doing something wrong for having to take my meds to be functional :(
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"Damn cut those people off. I get maybe you can't, but that's what I would do personally. Most of the addicts I know are either not in my life anymore or don't know I take anything like that. 

I also just don't have people over to my house, but I don't like people much in general 😅 I mean, I'm the nicest person ever but total introvert. 

Have you considered buying a fireproof safe or something? Sucks that it's something we have to even think about, but the world is freaking nuts

If they really want, I might still have my Adderall from 2019 😂"
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,That has never happened to me but I didn’t get diagnosed until I was 29. I could see it happening on college campuses
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"ONLY $20? Cheap-asses. lol. 

Honestly don't tell anyone its for adhd, just say ""my medicine.""

I don't care whose ass they're related to. Always file a police report when your meds get stolen. You don't need proof. You don't need to know how it was taken. You just know where you were when you last saw them, and you didn't give them to anyone."
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"If your aunt stole your script for a controlled substance, and then lied to a medical professional about it, then file a police report. Don't let the very real crimes of theft and fraud committed by someone else, regardless of who it is, tarnish your name."
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,Get a medication safe or a medication lock box. You never know what people are capable of.

People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,I wouldn’t ever mine. I would fuck my life up and have major anxiety everyday. No way.
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"I have a friend half joking asking me to try one to see what it's like because they suspect they have ADHD. 

Nope. Just no. 

1) not into illegally handing out controlled substances and risk losing my script
 
2) I only get a month supply and I need my meds every day. It's like giving a whole day away. 

3) hard enough for me to get my meds with this damn shortage. I had to call five pharmacies for this last month. 

I let them know if they want to find out if they have ADHD they can get tested, but they're definitely not getting my meds."
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"Stealing your meds is not only illegal, it's downright unacceptable. 

That's an insane violation of boundaries. I'd have a hard time not going full no-contact, calling the police, and/or suing her. Even if you don't win due to he-said she-said, it's the principle of making it clear that it's completely unacceptable. 

And anyone who says ""you called the cops / sued her??"" would immediately understand when you said ""Yes. She stole my prescription medication. A whole month worth."""
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"Yeah. I NEED my Adderall. I'm not getting high off of it, and probably couldn't if I tried. Don't ask to use MY medication that I need and can only get one 30 day supply of at a time, so you can speed clean your damn house and pull an all nighter."

People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,I had some one want to buy my Adderall prescription from me. Which I refused to sell it. 
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,$20 doesn’t even cover my copay for a month’s prescription…not to mention the fact that I’ve been waiting for it already for 3 weeks!
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"When I was in college I caught my then-roommate's ""friend"" trying to get into my lock box for my ADHD meds. I had a lock box because I didn't want to deal with people stealing my meds, and the way that loser would try and make up these sob stories to give him my meds was something else."
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,That’s insane! I’m so sorry you’re dealing with that.
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,I’d throw hands with my aunt if she stole all my meds wtf
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"If anyone’s partaking in my script, prices are before insurance. Steal my script, I may have paid $12, but you sir, owe me $80 thank you. Aftermarket costs for u fukface (aka older brother)"

People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,My Vyvanse was $100 CAD a month in Canada and $384 USD a month in the United States now. $20???
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,Just don't tell people about your meds.
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,20$ a pill maybe....
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"I find it so weird that everyone's so hung up on the $20 thing. It's so obvious to me that OP is just using that figure as an exaggerated example. The ""hurr durr"" thing was supposed to tip you off that what followed wasn't to be taken completely seriously.

Now instead of talking about how to deal with POSes who want our meds, 90% of the replies are expressing outrage at the entirely fictional twenty bucks."
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"I feel like I'm pretty open about the fact that I take stimulants (sometimes I'll vaguely say ""my medication"" in relevant conversation, but will usually disclose if specifically asked, or other times I feel it's fairly obvious what medication I'm referring to based on context clues). Over the past ~10 years I've taken them (albeit on and off) I can't recall a single time someone's either tried to steal my medication or even offered to buy it off of me. If the latter has happened, then they were being subtle about it and I was too oblivious to even pick up on it.

Maybe I've just gotten lucky with the type of people I'm around (I'm a college student living in a college town and a healthcare worker) or maybe there's a certain vibe I give off that makes people not bother asking, like they interact with me and they think ""nah this guy actually needs this shit I'll go ask someone else"" 🤪"
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"Man I can't even get my meds filled with insurance and a prescription. I now ration them as best I can, but I'm still probably going to run out.

People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"$20 didn’t even cover my costs😂 Wouldn’t take their money either way, kinda need my meds🫠"
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,Why did you let the record happen? You should have gone to the polica
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"I might be totally off base, but If I am remembering the regulations correctly, your psychiatrist should have reported the lost or stolen prescription to the pharmacy and the pharmacy was supposed to report that to the DEA. The pharmacy reporting part goes back as far as 2019 from what I can find. It makes sense that you wouldn’t want to file a police report. It was stolen by a family member, and you were staying at her house. So you risked being ostracized by your family and if you were staying with her for an extended period of time you would have risked being homeless. 

If you have the means you can probably contact a drug attorney who can help you get the “prescription amphetamine abuse” remark wiped from your medical records. It just might be time consuming and costly."
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"next time you get a text, you can forward a screenshot to local police.

When I want to stay with said friend for a night, I only bought one pill and told him I'm not allowed to carry around more than I need for a trip!

I keep the majority locked up in a spare pill bottle and I live alone. If they get stolen, I won't be able to get more easily."

When my friends ask for one I usually give it to them if I have any to spare.

I’ve also given some to people who have told me they think they might have ADHD. I only realized I had ADHD after my friend gave me some Vyvanse and my life suddenly switched to easy mode."

People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,There is literally no amount of money a person could give me for my Vyvanse.
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,Pretty sure he was looking to sell it for a bigger profit 🙄
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,Wait are meds that expansive ? I personally pay 15€ for my meds every month.
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,A day's supply maybe.
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,1000 atleast 
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,Yeah from what I hear they go for $20 per pill in some places. They are $580 short.
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,Exactly.

People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,My first thought!! 👏👏👏
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,My insurance paid $370 for my last fill.
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,I would almost pay that as a guaranteed delivery and I don't need to worry about anything fee.
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"And another reason why we should all have safes that no one knows the combo to. 

You should also ALWAYS keep your meds locked in your glove box when traveling. 

Not just in your glove box, but locked inside. In most states, it takes a warrant to search them. If you’re coming from the pharmacy? Always keep your meds locked in your glove box. Your paperwork, too. Have nothing on you that says “this person takes a controlled substance.” And never answer “do you have any drugs in the car” with “I have prescription medication that is prescribed to me.”

The answer is always “no.”"
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"History of addiction is one part of the reason I haven’t disclosed my diagnosis to my family. I usually have Vyvanse with me when I visit. I’m 99% sure it wouldn’t be a problem if they knew I had it because they’ve been sober a long time, have great support, and stimulants were never their issue, but I wouldn’t want to unintentionally create any issues or even uncomfortable intrusive thoughts/temptations regardless."
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"This is also the reason I had to change meds 3x (the shortage), it's considered a type 2 drug, and why I can't get a 90-day at once nor 2 refills and have to message my doctor every month for a refill and come in to her office after 90 days have passed. One of the extra charges on the medical bill I get is high office visits."
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"It is too late, since this happened two years ago. And I had more reasons to press charges. I was actually urged to by police the night she tore most of the hair off my head and kicked me on the streets. They handed me a slip of paper with the case number and said I had a year to decide, but at the time I was so scared of the idea of seeing her in court and hearing her shrill ass voice attempt to manipulate the judge against me that I made the choice to let it all go. Probably should not have, oh well."

People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"lol! Why do ppl think they are above seeing a dr like we had to? Yeah it’s expensive.

People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,I got a pill safe thing on [amazon](https://a.co/d/3q5Z2vt) because my maintenance person was habitually stealing my meds and I thought I was going crazy til I put a camera up and they took the whole damn pill bottle with a week left in it. I got 3 days out of my month script. it’s been handled but the irritation that someone made me worry about my mental on top of trying to keep my life together unmedicated warranted the locking case for my sanity.
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,For real get a lockbox unless you’re 💯positive you can deadass trust every person who comes into your space. I had a sibling steal my pain meds the day I was released from the hospital after having emergency surgery. The only reason they didn’t touch my ADHD meds is because I’m on vyvanse and they couldn’t crush and snort it.
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"> Stealing your meds is not only illegal, it's downright unacceptable.

People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"Not even another zero lol. You give me 20k and I’ll consider it, because it’s going to suck not having adderall for a month "
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"Before I was officially diagnosed a little over a year ago, the going rate was about $10 a pill.  If you bought BULK, you could get it down to $5,  but that was only if you were buying 150+. 

However, with how the shortage has been and the DEA cracking down on certain parts of telehealth, I'd say the going rate should be closer to $20 a pill nowadays. 

Anybody offering $20 for a whole script don't need any adderall, they already on that clownijuana."

People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,Adzenys is $400 without insurance. I’m still paying off the credit card bill from a few months ago when I was completely out of meds and unable to function and just bit the bullet.
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,When I was seeing a provider without insurance it cost me around $250 a month for meds and the visit combined. It'd have to be way more than that to risk going to jail and having to live without my meds. More than it's worth because health care in america is way more expensive than it needs to be.

People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"Pretty sure you are still taking a significant loss if you have to pay insurance deductible, copays, and doctor visits. Plus the time it takes to go to the store and hypothetically do a deal, not to mention the legal risk you are taking and the loss of your ability to function. You might as well just let them steal it from you and pretend you didn't notice. That way you are only giving $200 a month to avoid spending the rest of your productive years outside of prison. If you're that desperate for money, learn to suck D and go stand at a busy intersection. Lol its better you choose which ones to suck outside of prison than one of the bigger fellas deciding for you in prison."
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,How much do you pay just out of interest?
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,My Vyvanse are $450 a month! Insurance doesn’t cover mental health…. I wouldn’t even do $20 a pill! I can’t function without mine.
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"A month is just the cost of entry. Between the shortages and my complete inability to function it's more likely to be 2 or 3 months. But hey $20 that I will definitely spend super impulsively because, ya know, I'm off my fucking meds."
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,Yep at my uni they would go for 40-50$ a pill (never bought it myself lol but it was known who sold them and for how much)
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"I've never bought or sold but there was plenty of talk and I feel like that was the going rate 15 years ago when I was in school.

People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,That's the going rate for 30s around here. And people will pay more but I feel really gross doing that lol.

People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"It depends on your insurance plan. I paid $45 a month for Adderall (generic) and then it dropped to $9, had to switch to Vyvanse for a while during the shortage and was back up to $45. That went down to $9 as well after a while thank goodness.

My insurance is self funded by the hospital system I work for (although it does limit me to their providers, but thankfully it's a big system) so I have pretty damn good insurance but it adds up after a while especially when I have other meds to pay for too."
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"My deductible for adderall is 20 dollars. One time, when I was on Vyvanse, my deductible was 215 dollars for generic . So yeah 20 bucks for my month supply? Pffft"

People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,no...
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"I keep mine in a safe that cost $200.  It took a long time to be able to afford that.  Nothing else is 100% going to prevent theft from someone in your house determined to steal them.  I’ve had meds stolen from my backpack at group gatherings.  I tend to give people the benefit of the doubt and have not always been secretive about my meds but I’ve had people very close to me steal.  I’ve even forgiven them cause addiction sucks and ADHD sucks and being broke sucks (the 3 reasons I’ve been stolen from).  People do shitty things in desperation.  Not saying anyone is obligated to forgive anyone else for stealing, I’ve not forgiven all, just emphasizing it’s definitely not uncommon.

I’ve struggled with drug abuse, still have weak moments, as have some of my closest family and friends.  So my meds stay in a time lock safe and only my husband has the code for when it is “timer unlocked” to give me my meds.  I bring small amounts on vacations since I can’t bring the whole damn safe lol"
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"It honestly depends on the situation completely. If she lives with her aunt then hiding them is only a temporary fix until they are found. Keeping them on your person is only effective if you're aware of your surroundings at all times, keeping them locked with a key is only effective so long as you are the only one with the key. 


There is a reason they say ""locks keep honest people honest"" because if a thief is really determined they can usually circumvent any security you put in place. You need to be looking at the scumbag that stole something that wasn't theirs to begin with and not blame the person who had something stolen from them because they didn't commit the wrong doing.

People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"Mine says $85.43 without insurance. For 60 tablets of 20MG, one month supply. Generic brand. With, a $10.00 copay if insured, which I am. 

But $10, or even $85 doesn’t account for the (my feeling of severe) inconvenience of my lost time and lost productivity going into a doctor’s office every 90 days and going to a pharmacy in person every 30 days. It’s those doctors/pharmacy trips that are the inconvenience. So if I were charging my value-based time as worth $10 per milligram… that would be $1,200 per bottle. Which sounds about right to me. I would do this for myself for $10 or even $85 a month. But as a business person, committing a felony to sell it illegally, I would charge $1,200 per bottle, because that’s my freedom from the law, time, and effort lost on the activity."

People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"It's fucking ridiculous isn't it? I live in the UK and the medical care here is horrendous. I used the dark web to keep the meds coming. I didn't like it though. Too expensive and I was at the mercy of what they had in stock, not what I needed. I'm lucky I never hit bottom like you did.

I'm lucky and America is my native home country. I literally flew back there just to get it sorted and boy did they. It took MONTHS to undo the damage. (DarkWeb didn't do much but my UK doc who was supposed to ""specialize in adult ADHD failed to realize that I cannot be on progesterone due to my ADHD) My doc in the states untangled the mess and sent me back to the UK with some strongly worded doctors notes about further treatment. Haven't needed the DW since. I do help guide people who get screwed over like I did a lot though. Not everyone can just fly to America to get proper care. 

I'm so sorry you went through all that just because no one believed you. I think it's gross. I've learned to never NOT have a doctor's note about your situation. I carry mine in my wallet. I hope you are doing better now. I'm here if you need someone."

People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"I know that in this instance, they are asking about illegal drugs - which includes prescription drugs that you are taking without a prescription/haven't been prescribed to you or taking prescription drugs in a way that is not prescribed (usually you're taking them more frequently than prescribed). 

I don't take illegal drugs and I only take drugs that are prescribed to me and I take them according to the way that they are prescribed. 

In the exceedingly rare situation where I'm not taking them as prescribed and the meds are in the car with me, the deviation has been discussed with my provider because we're usually trying to adjust my dosage of a medication. So, again, not what the cop is looking for.

I have seen too many stories about ""being honest with the cop"" completely fucking the person over in life altering ways (up to and including the death of the person) that I don't have any issues with answering this question in the way that I do."

My psych knows about my history of drug use, and is part the reason I was tested and diagnosed.  It is kind if funny, in a sad way, how quick some psychs are to label us as drug seekers when people with ADHD have a much higher tendency to abuse drugs in order to cope with their symptoms.

People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"That's absolutely insane.   I'm sure this also depends on who you know and where you live, but that's just outrageous."
People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"I'll give you two answers, one long and one short. 

Short answer is I have ADHD and it felt good.  

Long answer is, I have ADHD and it was often euphoric, gave me a good bit of energy, and allowed me to focus.  The focus is the most important part for me, with inattentive type.  

I know some people don't experience much euphoria when taking their normal dosage, but keep in mind I was taking WELL above and beyond the maximum therapeutic dose. It was also ""street"" adderall, and while it certainly looked exactly like a legit pill, I have no way of knowing if it was real. The average max is 40mg a day, with more severe cases requiring 60mg.  As far as I can tell with what reading I've done, 60mg is the hard cap.  No one will prescribe you more than that.  The amount I was taking was completely unsustainable.  It would likely have killed me eventually. (90-120mg a day)

Another question I get asked often, especially by people who don't have ADHD, is why didn't I just get diagnosed?  Well, I have ADHD.  Committing to appointments and long term planning is notoriously difficult for us.  I suspected I had ADHD since around 6th grade, but I also had a few other severe mental disorders during by pre-teen and teenage years.  Any symptoms I had that could be pinned on ADHD were easily masked by the severe depression and anxiety disorder.  

I was seeing a therapist when I 25 that would have diagnosed me and given me medication.  I told her about my history of crystal use, and despite how much I liked the euphoria, the main reason I used it is because it allowed me to focus.  I declined it, because I assumed that medication would be prohibitively expensive to someone who didn't have insurance and could barely afford the weekly therapy appointments as it was.  I am not ashamed to say that, especially compared to how much I was spending on street adderall, it would have been far less expensive than I thought.  I regret not getting diagnosed then, but it is what it is. 

I've been on my real medication for over a year now, and I haven't touched anything illicit in over two years.  I also don't drink much anymore and only use the grass a few times a week.  I also don't abuse my meds and have no desire to do so."

Take your most recent pill bottle, with only meds you would need for that day if you are out and about. Keep it in the bottle with the label. Have your prescribing doctor/pharmacy numbers saved on your phone even tho the bottle has them. Have a receipt.

I tend to always ask if people are really struggling because I've been there and I would like people to feel safe asking me for help. Safe that I'll get them legit and not laced medication and for them to be able to talk to someone (like me or anyone who understands) that I know that these meds are NEEDED and taking matters into your own hands doesn't make you a junkie. 

I have made it my mission after all I went through and have ""friends"" and an ex who didn't understand that others will have a safe place to at least ask questions. 

. happy for you. Getting your ADHD sorted should always be seen as a cause for celebration. ❤️❤️🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳"

People asking for your ADHD meds or even outright stealing them,"Dang I wish I could be honest about my drug abuse issues with health professionals. Like it's OBVIOUSLY, CLEARLY a symptom of my ADHD. 

When I take my ADHD meds (and I don't even take my whole pill btw) almost all desire to abuse drugs goes away. Because that one medicine fills the hole in my brain that I'd been desperately trying to fill with other, much worse, much more destructive things since I was like 13. 

But I would never ever tell that to a doctor a psychiatrist in fear of ""drug seeker"" being put on my medical records and fucking me for the rest of life.

The DEA needs to fuck off. I don't know how, but I know it's the reason for this. Most doctors want to help people. That's why they enter the field. They know medicine helps people. They're just afraid of getting in trouble. Which is fair, but it leads to direct harm on countless others."

I’m clean and sober from  alcohol and pain meds 3.5 years now. During that use I also took adderall to get me through times without one or the other of the pain meds and alcohol. While I didn’t enjoy the adderall, it helped my wd symptoms and was worth the parts I hated of the med to get me through, so while I WAS addicted, it will never be a med I choose to abuse again. And even if I mess up, I have built such a relationship and honesty with my doctors that they’d not just kick me to the curb, they’d help me and adjust accordingly.

Ugg, this reminds me of my coworker... they always close the door when it's ajar when they pass it (the locks are on the older side, so if you don't push it hard enough they swing a bit open again), commenting with ""* chuckle * I'm a bit autistic when it comes to stuff like that"". Like, no, you're not autistic, you have no idea what it is like to be autistic or how hard it affects one's life. ""Autism"" is not a synonym for ""superfocused on certain details"", ADHD is not a synonym for ""being an airhead sometimes"", OCD is not a synonym for ""perfectionist"", giftedness is not a synonym for ""a young modern Einstein with 4 phd's and a bright future"",... I haven't had a formal diagnoses yet (all the symptoms though, and then some) but at least I can manage with coping mechanisms at the moment. And I know I'm lucky to be able to do that. Doesn't mean everyone can manage it like that as well. It's good neurological disorders get more attention, but they should be getting more _medical_ attention, not ""know-it-all"" ers's attention. They are just making the same mistake as the generation before, only in a different way, causing a lot of people to not get diagnosed properly."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"The awareness is great and helped me start to question with my therapist if some of the symptoms I experience might be ADHD related which led to an eventual formal diagnosis. But especially being diagnosed late definitely makes it hard to take myself seriously, because my imposter syndrome is just like “ah just jumping on another bandwagon to explain how lazy you are” and I feel like I can’t discuss it honestly with most people because of the terminally-online people who have turned it into a whole personality and/or trend. It’s neither of those — it just sucks.

Boss: oh my boyfriend has it too, everyone has adhd a little. Read a pamphlet from HR and it’ll be fine.

My bosses boss: Uh huh. Well I’m denying your request for PTO and ignoring your request for accommodations. 

The CEO: oh I have ADHD too. I get bored at meetings and really hate it so my kind wanders. But you just gotta find the things you really don’t like and force yourself to do them.

Whole thing felt like a joke. 

I only got my PTO when I sarcastically and angrily told him (after he asked what did I’d do if he denied any PTO at all) that I guess I’d just blow my brains out because I can’t take this anymore.

That got me about 4 days off. But I was told mental health is only a “one day issue, that’s why it’s a MENTAL HEALTH DAY. Mental health doesn’t take multiple days” 

My doctor had a field day in the letter he wrote about how I needed accommodation but it still got ignored and I ended up getting fired for “other reasons”."

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Buddy, they're tryna become tiktok famous, they don't give a fuck if their content affects some negatively.

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Omg, it's the absolute worst. My previous manager knew I had ADHD for a year without issue, but then started seeing Tiktoks that told him that even though people with ADHD had challenges, they also had ""superpowers."" This led him to start putting me in situations way above my level where he thought I'd excel, only to be disappointed when I'd crash and burn.

ADHD gives me ZERO advantages. It's a disability. It's crippling. I adapt to medications very quickly, so I'm constantly having to rotate meds. I have to work twice as hard and for far longer than my peers to achieve the same results, so I'm constantly burned out. I'm terrified of being in poverty when I'm elderly and can't keep it up anymore.

So when people talk about ""ADHD superpowers,"" it's very upsetting."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,Everyone does ADHD things just not as extreme as ADHD people. No one’s attention is perfect it’s a spectrum.

It’s everytime cringe when random people say this and you can’t even condomn anybody because well you can’t be 100% that the person doesn’t have it and at the end you don’t want to be judged either.

Thing is, because I’d been assessed as “gifted” at age 4, nobody seemed to twig that I had ADHD, even though I was disruptive and aggressive myself in many ways in primary school. I think there was a tendency to conflate ADHD in kids with low socioeconomic backgrounds back then, too."

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Yeah man. The commodification of our experience as quirky, mostly positive, or at the very least humorous, online content is frustrating. It’s similar to how Hollywood went through a phase of representing Autism as being a superpower that made you super smart and super focused, and mostly neglected how intensely it impacts day to day life.

I don’t particularly appreciate how it impacts the perception those around me have of me either. Any oversimplification of a life altering disability or experience is going to seriously harm the lives of those who suffer with it. 

I find it hard to blame folks who don’t get it, though. They’re mostly ignorant to the struggle we live through because they’ve only seen what the other people posting have. 

I also think there is some benefit to their existence. Even if it does suck that they’re spreading such false information about our experience, there is some truth, and a number of folks who have ADHD may feel motivated to seek a diagnosis after seeing one.

The complete and appalling lack of meaningful support for adults with ADHD, that really fucks me over. If you don't have a comorbid ""serious"" issue like IDD or some other problem, you can fuck right off the fucksville when it comes to support for adults. You will spend a lot of time reading resources written to adult parents of children with ADHD. You see mental health professionals whose training is generally in talking to non-ADHD parents of ADHD children or in solely treating children with ADHD. If you're a POC or woman, good fucking luck in finding a provider who wasn't trained on a model based on hyperactive little white boys.

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I share your frustration. I suffered through 31 years of intense, undiagnosed, untreated ADHD. Took that long to get a psych eval because I was raised by a religious fundie dad who thought psychiatrists are all quacks, psych meds are poison, and any kind of mental health condition short of schizophrenia was just an excuse for the behavior of weak, undisciplined, morally inferior people.

When I finally went to a doctor and got the diagnosis, it contextualized literal decades of embarrassment, shame, brain fog, social anxiety, and low self esteem (largely due to the fact that it took every ounce of my mental energy to complete basic daily tasks that my peers appeared to handle effortlessly.)

Now that I'm on medication, it's made a massive difference in my quality of life, BUT I've gone through four different prescribers in the past three years before landing on my current doctor, because apparently having a prescription for stimulants at the age of 33 automatically makes a lot of doctors and pharmacists assume that you're just an addict. I've had doctors grill me multiple times about my (mostly non-existant) recreational drug history, refuse to fill my prescription without me giving a drug test (despite the fact that I've done nothing that even appears to be suspicious), the last one tried to take me off of tge only medication that's ever made a difference in my symptoms, EVERY TIME I had an appointment with her. 

The last straw was when she decided to (without consulting or even informing me) only fill three weeks worth of my meds instead of a full month, causing me to run out of my medication halfway through a week-long family vacation in a different state, the last three days of which were spent in a miserable, incoherent fog. She failed to return my phone calls for two weeks, and when she finally did get back to me, she informed me that she ""thought that I wouldn't really need the full month's scrip, since I was on vacation"". She also tried to use the fact that I called her several times and left her a sharply-worded voicemail inquiring about why I hadn't received my full prescription, as evidence that I ""had a problem"" and shouldn't be on stimulants. 

Luckily I found a much better (and less ideologically motivated) prescriber after that, and things have been better, but fuck. There is SO MUCH ignorance and stigma around having this condition as an adult. Seems like more than half of people (including doctors) don't really believe that adult ADHD is even a legitimate condition."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Yeah. I am both happy and worried bc of the newfound social media awareness. I have been diagnosed by three different professionals (PCP, Clinical Psych and Psychiatrist) and have been having great results with the meds (Vyvanse 50mg). But once I say I have ADHD some people instantly think its a Tik Tok Diagnosis and kind of dismiss it. It’s not only with ADHD tho - I have read about people with (real) ASD, Tourettes, hEDS, POTS and Crohns that feel similiar - these are (of course) ALL real and scientifically proven diseases, but because of the sometimes unspecific symptoms, many people self-diagnose based on Social Media Hype and this invalidates the experiences of those with a real diagnosis."

I had massive sinus problems for years and years and years. Never once did my ENTs suggest removing my tonsils. One day my nurse aunt told me I have to tell them to take them out.

I can't follow through on anything, I'll start working on it and after 10 mins I tell myself I'll sit down and take a break. Then 11pm rolls around and I've binged watched videos on YouTube or followed the rabbit down a hole on the internet. It's such a cluster fuck I get overwhelmed and so nothing ever gets done. That's just my home office, imagine what happens when the stresses of life happen"
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"What about the people that grew up in an environment where mental health wasn’t really a thing? And it wasn’t until lurking subs like this one that they finally started to put the pieces together and ask questions and dig a little deeper to try and understand the disorder and in the process of doing so realizes they display almost all the symptoms and as a result decide to make an appointment for an evaluation to get a diagnosis because they’ve gone their whole life as unstable mess but convinced themselves that’s how everyone else was too and that, and that that was just how it is. I can definitely understand where your coming from though, but for some people if it weren’t for more awareness they might have never even considered that ADHD might affect them. I don’t have my diagnosis yet but I look forward to getting some help. I used to think I was bipolar or something but the symptoms correlate more closely to ADHD unless I happen to have both idk that’s why I’m going to the doctor. Like how many jobs do you have to quit/ lose or how many times do you have to change careers or how fucked up does your life have to be to need help? How bad do your mood swings need to be, your general sense of irritability and frustration combined with your general lack of patience. How many times do you need to walk into room and forget what you were going to do/ what you were doing.

Edit: not trying to be contrite honestly I’ve just gone back and forth with myself over whether I really have a disorder or I just think I do but why would I have the symptoms if I don’t and if I don’t then why do I have the symptoms. It’s driving me nuts I get to see the doctor Tuesday I just want some relief and to feel more “normal”"
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I read somewhere that 90% of tiktoks about adhd contain misinformation, lol.

I guess I can’t really judge bc I learned the symptoms of adhd and that I might have it from tumblr back in the day, but I actually went out and sought an official diagnosis. I know some people don’t have access to diagnosis and I get that it’s hard to get, but I still don’t think people should be spreading misinformation online. it does feel embarrassing to tell people I have adhd sometimes, especially in front of my older coworkers. I’m 26 so out of the tiktok target demographic and I’ve never downloaded or used that app at all, but I’m still younger than most of my coworkers and I feel like some of my coworkers make jokes about how ‘kids these days all think they have adhd’ and i’m never sure if they’re directed at me :("
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"it's definitely tough because on one hand, the increase in visibility of first hand accounts of ADHD is what led me to start researching it myself. I went to therapy off and on through my life as well struggling a lot in school and spending plenty of time in the guidance counselors office and never once had the idea even been floated. And I had always had that common misconception that ADHD is something they diagnose kids with for behaving like little kids and not little adults. Seeing people talk about how it has affected their life outside of hyperactivity (and often excluding hyperactivity) really resonated with me and I can't overlook that it was a crucial step towards seeking a diagnosis and treatment. 

Anyway, on the other hand, it definitely has led to a lot of oversimplification of ADHD and its applicability to literally any behavior. I think I can understand the impulse to ascribe so much of your behavior to ADHD, because for me that discovery to diagnosis process was a near constant ""OH SO THATS WHY I."" so naturally you want to apply to to so many other traits. I don't think there's anything wrong with self examination and wondering how certain traits relate to ADHD. I think a lot of times people mistake caused by/symptom of for exacerbated by. And then on the internet there is a tendency to imply some kind of universality to your own experiences. Some may think to add the disclaimer that they are only talking about themselves, but I think a lot of people forget that step and go straight to their word as gospel. 

Personally, I would rather search for ADHD advice and see people with ADHD (wherever they are in the diagnosis process) talking about their experience, versus what is still far more common which is advice aimed at parents of ADHD children. as though the only impact of ADHD is on the people who have to deal with them, and not the person themselves, and that it only affects children."

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I feel this hard. I think the problem is closely associated with amphetamine culture and abuse in Uni.

People think it’s a joke or don’t understand how we cognitively function different and can’t control our focus. It’s hard to understand how someone can view the world differently… and we just attach labels to ourselves to explain lapses in understanding. It’s like the tip of the iceberg - people see the tip and go “wow look how small that is” and laugh it off without looking in the water.

I had a guidance counselor who told me my good grades / test scores (1560 SAT / 36 ACT) were just because I was on medication and I wouldn’t make it in the real world. He then didn’t submit my test scores to my college. The perception that we are using drugs as some sort of performance enhancing drug to get an edge on everyone else is pretty common.

Also the misappropriation of ADHD casually (most cognitive disorders really) makes it worse. A rowdy kid who may just want attention or is out bursting is casually called ADHD. Or if friends can’t focus there’s a lot of “oh yeah I’m so adhd too”.

I find this a lot with my autoimmune disorder - and any experience in life. If people haven’t experienced it’s hard for them to conceptualize the full scope of the impact of these things. I’ll talk about my RA and the response is usually “oh yeah my hands totally get sore after a long day”.

That’s why having real discussion and compassion and openness with these things are so important."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Couldn’t agree with you more.

Your psychiatrist sounds mediocre at best, though, and like a quack at worst. A psych saying something “should have worked” is a psych who doesn’t know what they’re doing. No one med works reliably for an entire group of people. 

-Ritalin turned me into a zombie

-Vyvanse made me feel like Bruce Banner (very on my game, very intolerant of other’s bullshit)

-Adderall made me anxious and jittery

Instead they use it as an excuse for verious things. It's not all of them but it's noticeable and very similar behaviour to what was going on when i was a teenager and Had Depression.
I think in the end there's Always gonna be ups and downs about it. But i have not really encountered any people berating me for having adhd yet so maybe that's why i don't Care that much.

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I complained for years and finally put my foot down. Received my diagnosis at 43. 

I think what a lot of people don’t understand is that ADHD was not something that was easily diagnosed for some of us back in the 80’s and 90’s because in the past, a lot of providers looked for the extreme symptoms. Also, being a woman, you are dismissed pretty much right off the bat if you try to suggest what you suspect. 

A lot of us middle aged women have reached the “fuck this, I have no fucks left to give,” and are now overly assertive.

I had an amazing boss who taught me that it was ok to push back. She would tell me stories about how she would go to doctors with a complaint and the doctor would immediately dismiss her and not bother to doing any testing. 

For me it was:

“You don’t have ADHD.”

“Ok great, let’s do all the testing to make sure that is correct.”

“Oh wait…”

It’s annoying that people think that being diagnosed is a fad instead of what it really is: the medical community repeatedly failed many of us and we put our foot down."

As far as the whole trendy thing goes I hate it too. There are a lot of really good ADHD/ASD Content creators and seems like they take a back seat to these asshats.

 I feel you on hardly being able to function. I once misplaced an entire prescription and my husband got upset because it was important for me to have my medication and he said “you just can’t be so forgetful!” I told him, “I HAVE ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER. I literally cannot help what my brain remembers and forgets.” He apologized and said he knows it’s hard for me and he felt bad for getting upset. I am sure it’s difficult living with my spacey ass but he loves me and encourages me a lot. 

I am in the process of being on a higher dose of strattera and it would have totally messed me up if I didn’t have them (went from 40 mg to 80 mg) it does seem to help somewhat but not as much as 30xr adderall.

Granted they helped me realize there was more to my anxiety than I realized, but I agree it's just listing off traits that are common for any person that can be an ever so slight burden to them. Except if they pack for a trip they might forget one thing and remember it right before heading out. However it's a heavy burden for me like when I pack for a trip I remember something 10 minutes away, turn around, grab it, then remember something else, turn around, grab it, then an hour into the trip remember I forgot my pillow or something I really needed. But by then I've made too many turn arounds, running late on my trip, and too far on the road to turn around and just say ""fuck it I'll just buy another if I really really need to."""
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Hey mate, it's ok, you're alright. 

I'm not being critical, I just observe that maybe you're panicking a bit with your situation?  Which is fair enough. ADHD is difficult! I just encourage you to try to be patient and kind with yourself (which is also difficult!) and with those around you, who probably don't/can't really understand what life can be like for you.

I take vyvanse 70mg and occasionally have to top up with 5-10mg of Dexedrine in the afternoon. I was lucky and hit on the right medicine for me straight away, but from what I understand, it can take time for different individuals to find the medication that works for them, so don't give up. Perhaps 20mg is to low a dose for your tolerance? Hopefully you can discuss and explore these possibilities with your Dr.

As far as tiktok goes, I would just ignore it and focus on more helpful ADHD related material. I strongly recommend checking out the [Hacking Your ADHD ](https://pca.st/podcast/fa829090-cc14-0137-1e16-0acc26574db2) podcast. Although I was medicated for 2 years, I don't think I really appreciated or accepted what it really means to have ADHD until I started listening. It's really great.

I appreciate the awareness of ADHD that is growing in many (anglophone, at least) countries, and that the TikTokers may have played a part in that. But the crassness of using and styling your ADHD as a vehicle for some kind of fame or money making is inauthentic, annoying, selfish, lacking in self awareness, creates unnecessary cynicism and generally becomes more and more counterproductive for people with ADHD. But hey, that's what the noxious combination of social media and capitalism encourages."

I either need to be so occupied that I (hopefully) ignore my compulsions (like intense gaming, studying or speed reading) or I need to be without activities at all.. for reasons I still don't quite understand.

I've worked with many doctors over the years with access to top staff in the province thanks to amazing funding sources that I had access to due to being a kid with cancer at one point.

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Nah I don't like gatekeeping neurological disorders that are notoriously hard to get diagnosed for here if you aren't male or pay to go privately...

My inattentive ADHD is mostly inattentive to myself because I'm the last to know. Im also autistic myself so yeah my ""self read"" is extremely low. 34 years old my ways of coping just broke after covid and having kids, I thought I was crazy. 




Tiktok fucking saved me. I was laughing like.. jeez these people think everything is adhd I do all this shit and more. And sure, the key is frequency, and I'm sure there's some faking it for attention. But it was an amazing starting point for me. I bought Russel barkelys book and some others and started research, everything was lighting up more and more lightbulbs. Saved up and went to a private psychiatrist, said its fucking obvious i have it and have always had it. Checked my school reports, talked to family etc.


Medical misogyny is incredibly real. Gatekeeping information is incredibly real. Communities of frustrated and lost people who just got diagnosed and are passionate about educating people are real. Self diagnosis is real-not watching 5 tiktoks and self diagnosing, but sparking the focus to do science backed research into credible sources, yes. That's valid self diagnosing. I knew by the time I went to the psychiatrist it didn't matter what he said, I had it. And treating myself like I did and using tools like I did actively helped me. And now it's official I hope meds can really help more too.


It's not that I haven't struggled. I really have. I've been to some incredibly dark places,frequently. I was actually quite comfortable suffering and directing the brunt of everything internally and at myself, but it's when I started to effect my kids that I sought help. Even so, I really don't get this particular subs seeming focus on the negative. Keeping optimistic in the face of a crippling disorder is one of the main things that keeps me going. Laughing at tiktoks that make fun of my eccentricities and issues brightens my days.



Legit licensed professionals are also sharing easily accessible information in small enough sections that I can focus on what is pertinent to me. People like KC Davis have been instrumental in me treating and letting go one of my worst issues, of guilt and shame of not reaching a certain standard.



Does all of that come with a few random teenagers forgetting why they came in a room and harkening back to old school Internet ""lol I'm so random, cringe""? Sure. They've always been there and they always will be there."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"It’s funny cuz the most difficult part of ADHD for me is the lesser talked about symptoms of it. 

Like emotional dysregulation, easily overstimulated, increased sensitivity physically & mentally, impulsivity (for me it’s impulsively putting something down without realizing it, leading to “forgetting”—not really forgetting but never had  acknowledged where I put it down, and so I look forgetful. As well as impulsively saying what’s on my mind during a conversation because if I don’t say it at that exact moment I will forget it), sleep problems, storing memory & navigating that stored memory in the brain, executive dysfunction.. I mean the list goes on. 

ADHD is *not* “I forgot my lunchbox”, its *much more* then that, that’s just the tip of iceberg."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Yeah, this. I fucking hate it.

Fun fact:

A lot of this is due to COVID. During COVID, many barriers to access medication/forms of therapy were lifted in order to make remote access easier and more accommodating. So these companies popped up and started pushing pills, telling everyone they may have adhd for the smallest, dumbest reasons.

And now due to that and other reasons, theres a shortage of adderall. 

I was diagnosed at an extremely young age. Meds made me wanna kms and i did try in 4th grade. People now just say they have it because they watched a stupid tiktok designed to go viral, or they got curious and went to one of these virtual-meeting “psychs” capitalizing on loopholes who wanna push pills for $. 

If you want to know if you have adhd, go to a fucking real doctor. They will straight up TEST YOU. And any good psych doesnt wanna give you fucking schedule 2 drugs, so they’re not going to just let you slide in a lot of cases. 

People glamorize it. I have to take my embarrassing little task/goal whiteboard if i have guests and mute a billion reminders on my phone if im out and phone not on silent. I take twice as long as anyone to do anything.

Shit sucks.

Social media/phone use causes a mild form of ADHD but unlike the real thing, minimizing SM/phone use will make these symptoms go away.

So for any of you that feels this applies to you: get  off reddit, go touch some grass, and go see a GOOD psychiatrist. Best you can afford."

I'm 38f and it explained so much - why everything was harder for me but was a walk in the park for others. And yes, I do have a formal diagnosis that indicated I was ""off the charts"" inattentive. However, I am not one to discount someone's lived experience if they don't have the funds, the time, or the executive function to obtain a diagnosis. 

Many women struggled for years not knowing they had ADHD because their symptoms don't match the stereotypical male symptoms. Folks vlogging about it on tiktok has created more conversation around it, which will hopefully lead to more research and more solutions for everyone. 

And just like with any trend, there's going to be moochers hopping on the bandwagon to gain followers or whatever. I think folks that truly struggle with ADHD scroll past those ones pretty quickly - they're usually not even accurate. 

For me at least, the trend has made it more comfortable for me to discuss it with others, including my employer (who's been awesome about it). I'll gladly correct folks that may have learned about ADHD from the top 10 videos but I've otherwise found the general public to be far more versed in it than they were when I was a kid."

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I understand your frustrations, but I'm glad for the videos (I don't have tik tok, but I've seen a few on FB). I had 0 idea that inattentive ADHD was a thing. I've been feeling so overwhelmed, especially lately, because I can't ""adult"", I'm always running late, I can't keep organized, I forget about 90% of my meetings and deadlines, yet I keep being given more responsibilities. My anxiety and depression has been off the charts because I feel like I can't juggle everything and it's ruining my life and making me feel like failure of a wife. Like I feel like I'd be better off being single because my husband does so much for me and I don't have the energy to even put away the laundry he washes, or unload the dishwasher after he's loaded and ran it. At least if I was single, I wouldn't have to worry about him and how my need to disconnect from everything and shut down for an extended while would impact him.

Anyway, I definitely think I have inattentive ADHD, and I went in for a consult this past week and have an appointment with an actual psychiatrist at the end of August (3 months after my initial Convo with my PCP ...yay for the mental health system). While I was there I filled out a WURS, and after I turned it in, I looked up how it's scored. I'm 100% certain I will be diagnosed. I'm hoping meds will help me feel a little more centered and in control of my life... But I wouldn't have ever suspected ADHD if it hadn't been for the current hype.

... It is annoying though that my mom shrugs it off because I wasn't hyper (even though I've explained inattentive ADHD to her), and my coworker says ""all teachers have ADHD because we have to split our attention and make a thousand decisions a day"".. like no. You are not crippled by it. You don't need to take a nap some days before even attempting to drive home. You can go home and do things where I have 0 energy and can't accomplish even basic house cleaning during the school year. I'm 34 and can't imagine having kids because I can't even take care of myself. I can't wrap my head around how some people are teachers, parents and have time for a life or things like volunteering.

Long rant, but I hate posers of any type and am annoyed at all the people crying ADHD, but I sure am glad for the attention these videos are bringing because I'm definitely starting to understand myself better and I'm hopeful for medical help so I can have some peace of mind."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Every post like this on the sub is so hard because I feel the exact same way (I find myself defensively telling people about how my therapist proactively suggested the diagnosis and I had no inkling of it before that) — BUT there are so many people for whom the online awareness wave has been what allowed them to gain clarity about themselves and do something about it. 

I think we need to be careful only to criticize the people gaining money or clout from the hype train, not the people who are trying to figure out if they have ADHD because of it. Particularly given that access to care and quality of care are so insanely variable by location and SES."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"People with ADHD have NEVER been taken seriously, but at least there’s awareness of it now. Properly educate the people around you if it’s bothering you so much. My mom doesn’t have TikTok, but she still tells me “everyone deals with that, just move on”. ADHD has never been taken seriously and has always just been seen as “the kid who can’t sit still” and nothing more than that."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I'm incredibly grateful for the awareness because it would've never crossed my mind that I have ADHD. I got diagnosed with depression three years ago but always felt that there must be more to it - and it clicked when I saw a TikTok where they talked about how depression and burn-out can result from ADHD. I then got a first short assessment by my therapist. It's very clear to her already, but I'll have an additional 3 hour assessment in a few weeks with a psychiatrist.

What I find most annoying are the ""having a gf with adhd"", where the gf acts like a hyperactive infant that needs special treatment all the time. Even if this is the experience for some couples (idk) it still feels cringy the way it is portraied (like it was comedy) and I don't want people to think that this is what my ADHD-struggles look like..."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"This right here mods, this is why I'll always oppose the rule that we have to respect self diagnosis."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I get how it can be annoying, but it's not exactly the tiktoks fault (even though it does seem like it).
Before the recent awareness of ADHD on social media, I wouldn't be diagnosed. I definitely wouldn't have accepted my other issues were comorbid Autism either. Heck, my mother was diagnosed back in the 80's and she still tried to deny it was true for herself or me because of the old stereotypes. The tiktoks shed light on the wide diversity of profiles, and that's why they end up being so diversified and more ""neutral/good"" leaning than showing the struggles. Nobody wants to think something is wrong with them, especially people who have been shit on their whole lives for their undiagnosed (or diagnosed) ADHD.

The research shows it's still underdiagnosed even given the recent surge. People just dont want to accept that this neurological condition is ACTUALLY a normal and common condition of the human experience ~ and so the uneducated blame tiktok for what is actually a long-standing combined ego+lack of research issue in Psychology. 
For sure it is hard to function as someone with ADHD (and other comorbid issues that are common for us)...but it gets easier as you gather knowledge and confidence.

I've been in that headspace where I was severely depressed, to the point of meltdowns because I felt useless and a burden to others. I was struggling with managing everything in life and even questioned if I should be pursuing my degree. The solution took a while to sort out mentally and logistically, but I just doubled down on accepting my ADHD and either negotiating or forcing (lol) others around me to accept ""IT IS WHAT IT IS"". It's not my fault if others try to enforce unrealistic expectations in face of me trying to communicate.

Also, just as an aside ~ At 20mg you are still actually under the ""therapeutic dose"". I take 30mg Vyvanse (when needed, mostly for Uni or housework) and that is considered the ""mimimum"" to actually be in any way effective lmao (I dont take more because I also have GAD and it exacerbates my sensory issues too much). I'd definitely double check with your doctor why they are still putting you at a low dose...usually they only do that to make sure the effect strength is desirable and not causing any weird side effects ~ NOT as a regular dose to treat executive dysfunction.

Edit: typo"

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I fucking feel the pain at others making light of your condition. While I haven't been diagnosed, my life has been riddled with occurrences that strongly lead me to believe I have autism, ADHD, or both, to a minor/moderate degree. Not to mention reflecting on my mother's, father's, grandfather's, and uncle's actions/personalities. I've been mocked and laughed at by family for things I've said and done that I couldn't help doing/made sense to me. 

Now, not to make this about me. I would just add that it's worth remembering that for many--like, possibly, myself-- ADHD isn't quite so debilitating, but troublesome enough. That said, I agree, forgetting something every once in a while does not ADHD make. But as others have said, I would much rather have the hype so there's awareness than not. While ofc some still disregard it, there are now SO MANY more people who are aware of what their loved ones and strangers are suffering with and are more able to give them the compassion and support they deserve."

I didn’t. And now I see a psychiatrist for it. And my life is infinitely better now that I understand the way my brain works

As a woman, we are incredibly uneducated about adhd for women. I thank those videos for opening my world. 

I do agree many people on there are NOT qualified to be giving diagnosis and people who are not diagnosed as adhd should not be giving advice. But at the same time I’m not quick to judge and assume their story"

Yeah. It’s debilitating. I literally always just thought my brain was… broken and I couldn’t control myself on a daily basis. Like I would buy stuff, say stuff, do stuff, then not do anything. Randomly. I had no control. I was thousands in debt from impulsive purchases and hyper focusing on random products. I quit my well-paying job a year ago because it was so difficult to stay on track. I forget everything. My house is a mess. Yet I’m able to hyper focus on special interests until suddenly I never want to think about them again. It’s so exhausting that I went through many moments of feeling extremely dark thoughts. I’m medicated now and I haven’t found the right dose but I know there’s hope now and that my brain isn’t broken.

I hope that the folks who have adhd are able to find out and get help, maybe from these videos, but it’s very insensitive to create tiktoks with only the “fun quirky” side of adhd for internet follows and likes."

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I struggled these symptoms my whole life.  Before it was ""cool"" a trusted friend who was my primary care physician recommended I be evaluated after I was concerned with how much difficulty I was having with a new job (IT/coding) and being able to concentrate on longer assignments when finishing my masters.   After a 2 day eval the psychiatrist couldn't believe that I had gotten this far in life given my testing results.   Starting Adderall and doing a deep dive into learning more about the disease process was life-changing. 

Fast forward to last year and I needed to switch Primary Care provder, he's right out of school.  He's going over my med list and says ""sorry, I don't prescribe adderall for anyone, it's just a performance enhancing drug, I could also take it if I wanted and I would function much better at work"".. it's very frustrating to hear that from a new physician.

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"It's worth recognizing that there are a number of causes of ADHD symptoms, and not having frontline meds (which both guanfacine and adderall are) work just means that you possibly have a different underlying mechanism for those symptoms, and thus need different meds.

[If you're not sensitive to norepinephrine, you may find atomoxetine (Strattera) helps.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomoxetine) (It actually did help my concentration, but I had to move off of it because it aggravates POTS.)

[Also, buproprion (Wellbutrin) has worked for many people.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bupropion)

Additionally, there's a med related to guanfacine, [clonidine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonidine), that helps some people, but is not a front-line med for ADHD."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"It will pass.  Today's ADHD trend is yesterday's OCD.

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I had a late life diagnosis. Managed to muddle through life until menopause and then wham. Told my dr I thought I was developing dementia or something. I was worried about losing my job. Couldn’t remember meetings, couldn’t organize myself, couldn’t make myself do things that were boring but necessary. When I filled out all the questionnaires and answered all the questions in person, and the dr said yup, looks like ADHD, I was a bit flabbergasted. But a lot of things made more sense - my inability to keep friends as a kid, my never being able to do homework until the very last minute, all the things I started and never finished, getting into debt for very stupid things, so many things. 


Took awhile to figure out medication dose because when I felt like it wasn’t helping, I just stopped taking it and didn’t go back for a few months. Ritalin did nothing for me. Vyvanse at 20 and 40 mg- mostly nothing. I was chattier on 40- like just a bit more willing to have conversations , not talking off people’s ears. When I finally saw my dr many months later, the dr said I might need a higher dose. 60 mg was the magic for me. Holy cow did it make a difference. I’m still time-blind and forgetful. But it’s like whatever was getting in the way of being able to do the thing I need to do is gone. I had no idea how much anxiety was a problem until after finding the right med and dose. Felt like I had taken lorazepam rather than lisdexamphetamine. 

Anyhow. I get what you’re saying about all the hype. It’s like people glibly saying they are OCD about something. It minimizes the real struggle. At the same time, I kind of like seeing some of it because it helps to know I am not the only person who has problems. I hope you find the right medication for you."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I wish I could upvote this post more. I was diagnosed at age 42 and after going through a butt load of testing just this year.

Thankfully I’m largely around people who also have it so they understand the struggle, the plus side of this is that I can be myself around them, I’m also almost 30 and I gotta be honest I act childish as fuck but they say we are about 30% behind in “development” so at heart we’re basically 20 year olds trying to find our way in life."

That's it? 20 does nothing for me but maybe push back the withdrawal feelings a little from dependency.

25/30 is where things start to work. 30/35 is where I need to be to do much intellectual labor. 

Unfortunately, however, dosing has become way too conservative these days. My therapist thinks it has to do with the opioid crisis and prescribers making false equivalence fallacies or something. So unfortunately many people are getting underdosed now. 

I certainty have been. My older MD psychiatrist had me at 35/3x a day. Moved and new guy, some young PA, lowered me for no clinical reason to 20/2x a day and my entire life fell apart. He just kept saying ""you need to rely on more than just meds""."

No, it's because my brain wasn't working properly. Medication works pretty  good but i still have some nasty habits including going on reddit too much. Though at work now I don't have to fight myself to not go on reddit (i'm at home right now, should be writing my book).

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Yeah, preach. I don't even tell people I have ADHD anymore partly because of this. People are just too misinformed and then you're going to be fighting an uphill battle.

What I do instead is tell people (who I work with or who my ADHD otherwise impacts) that I struggle with X specific thing. Like I'll say, hey, I function better if I can do X instead of Y. Or I'll say I struggle a bit with this. My usual way of dealing with it got interrupted so it led to making this mistake - sorry. 

This leads to much better understanding than putting a loaded label on it. And since ADHD is so widely known about, this runs the risk that people will figure out I have ADHD and then make assumptions about me. But the fact that knowledge about it is also so skewed means that people don't necessarily clock it because they think ADHD is all spacing out in conversations and having unhinged reactions to squirrels."

I'm also not depressed, I'm a fat jolly mofo like Santa Clause. 

But I also got fired from my last job because I just couldn't bring myself to complete tasks and performance slipped after the novelty wore off. I knew exactly what I needed to do, exactly how long it would take, but I couldn't get past that step. Total mental block about following through on anything.

I briefly went off meds when finding out I was pregnant and those 5 weeks were fucking awful. I couldn't function, I couldn't get anything done. I wasn't starting a million new hobbies, I did nothing. I went from showering every day and washing my hair 2-3 times a week to showering twice every 10 days. I couldn't hold a single thought, which left me paralysed and the boredom was unbearable. 
I'm back on a lower dose now and while I feel I need to up it maybe a lil, its helped a fair ammount. I can collect my thoughts better, I can do some tasks easier. Showering, whilst not back to being every day is every 2 days, sometimes 3.

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I have very similar feelings, ritalin worked well for me at the start but now it's been sliding a bit. I got increased to 30mg mane, from 20mg and it made a slight difference and now I'm not too sure it's doing much more. I have to ask coworkers or friends their opinion if they notice a difference.
Overall ritalin helped me significantly with emotional regulation, but keeping focus and being able to switch to tasks I need to do quickly has been FUCKING IMPOSSIBLE.  I just don't know where to go next, I'm a pharmacy technician and my psychiatrist asked me what I'd recommend for myself, I froze and didn't have an answer... like isn't that your job? 

I know I work in a pharmacy and have a decent knowledge of medications and how they work, but I'm at a psychiatrist because I haven't been able to figure out what to do with my GP. 

I'd like to try lisdexamfetamine, but that requires psychiatrists to do an extra course with the Ministry of Health and also isn't funded so itll cost a ton, my main worry isn't it working, I'm worried about it working too well and I feel stuck having to pay for a medication each month that I'd probably struggle to pay for after financing part of my newish car."

ADHD has made my life way more difficult than it ever needed to be. I lost so many assignments. My locker and desk were always a mess (my desk still is). I have trouble managing emotions and it makes me hate myself because I know I’m hurting other people around me who I care about. If I have too many things to do at once, I become overwhelmed and end up doing none of them. 

My mother deciding I shouldn’t be medicated as a child also made me miss so many opportunities. It sucks.

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Hey, my ADHD specialist told me that you need to get actual restful sleep in order for most ADHD medications to work; i was on Adderall as well and only noticed benefits the first week before things came crumbling down again. He, after looking at my diagnosis for sleep apnea, asked me if I've been using my CPAP. When I said no(because of ADHD and OCD making it nearly impossible) he told me that's probably why the Adderall wasn't working.

Especially if you snore, I'd recommend seeing if you can have a sleep study done. If your brain can't do it's thing at night, Adderall (apparently) won't do it's thing during the day. And sleep apnea is literally not breathing, which means your brain gets less oxygen at night. Which is harmful for so many reasons.

This is also a big reminder that I have to schedule another auto study or figure out with my insurance how to get another CPAP machine. Thanks for the reminder lol"
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Ive never paid too much attention to online trends, but i feel you. What’s embarrassing to me about adhd is a bit of the opposite for me.

Its the negative trends, like the notion that we are lying about it, we are just lazy and now i feel its associated with something really juvenile or ill intentioned. Makes me feel a bit shy about it, like i need to grow up and stop making excuses - which is a horridly unhealthy mindset!

If I hadn’t been blessed with my wife, who could have left me 10 times over, I’d be hopelessly alone.

I lose my wallet two or three times *every morning* and it’s not in the least bit funny.

And the accidents and injuries! I’ve been hit by several cars when I was a road cyclist. Literally stopped that sport all together after the last one had us thinking it was, in fact, the last one.

Broken bones and concussions too.

And what about quiet family or holiday time? Nope. Can’t chill out for 10 minutes to save my life. There goes down regulation except without extreme effort and mindfulness. 

Let’s not get into the anxiety and depression.

I don’t have a diagnosis yet, it’s months to get in to see someone. But if it is ADHD, it’s been one helluva ride that I’m rarely in control of."

So NO adult gets diagnosed in my country, and almost no girl ever gets an adhd diagnosis. I really believed I had bipolar, until I moved to a different country and adhd online content started pop up. It helped me get rid of the ridiculous amount of meds I was on, because I actually fit into ADHD perfectly (unlike bipolar, which didn’t actually make much sense).

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"hey, Im trying to avoid reddit these days and using the shitty reddit/API behaviour as motivation but I did cave today and came across your post. Def not going to read all these I am sure hopefully helpful replies but want to add 2 points on the off chance they havent been mentioned 

1. Apparently guanfacine and stimulants can be synergistic so if you havent, it might be worth trying both. I take guanfacine at night and dex in the day. I have very very subtle improvements to the point I only realise when I havent taken them. Super frustratingly subtle compared to the stories you hear about but very real.
2. I saw an ADHD specialist psychologist recently (I already have a psychologist but they arent ADHD experienced and the difference even in that one meeting was amazing so I wish I had met the ADHD specialist one earlier) and they said anecdotally, it seems that people with both ADHD and autism do not have that life changing response we hear about. And given the prevalence of co-morbid ADHD and autism, they dont even screen for one without the other and suggested I also get screened for autism. 

Best of luck. I wouldnt wish the challenges I experience on anyone."

These people don’t understand the feeling of just totally forgetting to do something that is actually incredibly important to you due to adhd. I’ve lost jobs, ruined reputation with some, and lost friends. I went to school for years to get a job in an industry. Applied and forgot to check my email for a week. Nobody understands the shame you feel for being so dumb. Offered an interview and didn’t check email in time to go. I can’t even explain why I didn’t check. I wanted this job so badly. But other stuff came up and I just forgot. This kind of thing makes you lose complete trust in yourself. It’s not cute. It’s not scatterbrained. It’s like you can’t take the actions to care about the stuff you care about. How anyone can have adhd workout eventually developing an anxiety disorder of some kind is beyond me"

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I’m sorry, you’re experiencing that, and I used to take serious offense when I would hear “Bipolar” being casually used in conversation when describing someone who changes their mind often. I thought I had BP (who knows, my dr is being really thorough and careful with meds just in case it’s co-morbid) until last week. I am actually *relieved* that I have finally been diagnosed with ADHD. I had no clue it was even possible, considering the stereotype of ADHD and how it presents in my behavior. No embarrassment, just literally relieved that there are steps I can take to fix things. I felt as though I had hit a wall and I had truly given up. 

I had someone respond to a post of mine with “what coast are you from, so many liberals blah blah getting diagnosed to excuse being an a-hole blah blah”. It sucks and I feel you."

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,I feel you. I think it’s become “popular” to pretended like you have issues you don’t just for clout and attention. Also Ritalin made me focus on my distractions rather than my necessary tasks of daily life. Also made my anxiety worse and I had more panic attacks on it. I hope you find what works for you because I’ve been diagnosed for almost 20 years now and still haven’t found a medication that works like a cure. They all eventually just stop working.
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"If it helps at all, try to remember that the vast majority of the population does not use TikTok.

People who are immersed in TikTok often over-estimate the extent of its effect on society as a whole. It really isn’t as important/influential as you might think.

I suggest taking a month off from TikTok. Let your brain recalibrate and see what life is like without it. By the end of that month, I suspect you will care a lot less about what anyone on TikTok has to say about anything."

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I was diagnosed with severe adhd and it is absolutely debilitating.

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"You are not wrong. The world is wrong. In your mind, tell your co-workers to go shove it. They don't know shit. I can't help you with the wife unfortunately, other than seeing if other medications can help more effectively, there seem to be a lot more types nowadays. Relationships are a two way street. If a partner doesn't like the fact that you are a certain way (and without effective mediation it is difficult to fix), she can either deal with it or go shove it (and everything in between, learn more about adhd, etc.).

Sometimes social media is a somewhat harmful waste of time. It sounds like TikTok for you is a *TOXIC* waste of time. I believe TikTok is a toxic waste of time for *EVERYBODY*.

Also, forget your coworkers if they’re making you feel less-than, but…
A LOT of people with ADHD are autistic. It’s also not an insult. Is it *possible* you *might* be autistic? I don’t know you, so I can’t say, but It’s a question worth asking…  It *would* help explain why stimulants don’t help you the way they do most other people with ADHD."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I completely get this. I think it's tricky, especially as a girl with ADHD who wasn't diagnosed until high school because ""you can't have ADHD and good grades"" and ""it's probably anxiety"", the fact that people are more open to diagnosis and discussion now is, in my opinion, an amazing thing. However, people are really bad in the way they self-diagnose themselves, or 'promote' it on social media. I hear so many people these days who literally will describe someone who is energetic as 'ADHD', like, please, don't use a proper term as an adjective! I also think that these accounts on social media almost make ADHD seem mainstream, or a regular issue? Like, they act as if ADHD is a normal thing every single person has. It makes it seem less valid, like, ""Oh, I get distracted too."" I feel like its a really shitty way for people to try and be sympathetic, or even at times, just to get attention. Mental health has almost become a 'trend' on social media, which whilst it's amazing that people are finally removing the stigma around it, I feel like it's being joked about way too often and medical terms are being misused way too regularly. It gives me the ick when people call themselves 'OCD' for liking to be organised. No, OCD isn't just wanting to colour code your pens. No, ADHD isn't just being super energetic and unfocused. It's more than that, and I feel like social media is really making it feel less valid."

But she kept denying I had ADHD for weeks until I told her off.

People will so often just assume you're trying to be quirky...and, it sadly predates tiktok. I'll be 30 next year and people were saying ""haha I'm so adhd"" when I was in secondary school.

To be fair though my colleague did initially get ""diagnosed"" by me. My sister is autistic, my closest childhood friend was, one of our other colleagues is, and this guy was ringing all the bells and apparently his doctor agreed. So sometimes it helps to be talked to by non-professionals to get yourself to consider going. Obviously this is off topic but ADHD and Autism is getting the same ""glam"" treatment right now."

Where I'm from, people also think having ADHD is just being hyperactive/restless. That's gotta be like the LEAST harmful symptom, if harmful at all, and many of us don't have it (not visibly anyway, mental hyperactivity just makes you look zooned out while in reality you might be freaking out)."

I feel embarrassed trying to explain to somebody that I have ADHD and what that means, because the general public perception of what ADHD entails seems to be heavily centered on the misinformed belief that ADHD is a silly, trendy, and largely harmless thing. Every time I have to explain it, I feel like the other person is doing internal eye rolls and imagining that I just really like Invader Zim and pretending to be distracted by shiny objects or somesuch.

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"This is why I don’t really talk about mine very often. If someone asks me then I tell them but otherwise I keep it to myself. What’s happening with ADHD now is the same thing that happened with Anxiety and Depression in the late 90s and early 20s. It’s been sensationalized and because of that, everyone walks around saying they have it when most of them don’t. I think the reason for this is because pretty much all ADHD symptoms are things that everyone experiences from time to time; so people think they have it because they experienced hyper focusing or time blindness or executive distinction. What they don’t realize it that it’s the the consistency and duration of the symptoms that distinguishes between having ADHD and just having the odd symptom from time to time. Hopefully this will eventually balance out but my biggest concern is the amount of people that are being prescribed medication for it that they don’t actually need. It’s creating a pandemic of amphetamine addiction that we won’t be able to meet the medical treatment needs to correct. And instead of people dealing with the trauma that came from 3 years of Covid Quarantining and Social Distancing, they are all just getting put on incredibly dangerous medication that they don’t need in order to cope."

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Sometimes having this weird little brain disorder is fun because I can crochet super fast ALL FUCKING DAY and LOVE IT (I also learn new hobbies or skills fast with what feels like no effort and I absolutely love that about myself), but usually… and that means most of the time, it fucking sucks. I am sailing that ship with you. This is not a “quirky” disorder. It effects every facet of life, to the point that most things feel like they’re challenging the very essence of who I am. We have to fight against ourselves, constantly, to fit in and function in the society we exist in. With adhd, existing is exhausting - never mind everything else we have to do so that the culture were currently in, doesn’t turn against us. 

I just don’t tell anyone but those who are required to know. My doctor, my partner, my son. Otherwise, what’s the point? My medication is stigmatized. My existence is trivialized and questioned. I would be told that I make all the wrong choices in life that *thats* why I’m like this, not because of any kind of neurological mis…wiring in my mothers womb that I had no choice or say in whatsoever. 

Having adhd isn’t ever something to fucking **want**, but if you experience it… acceptance is where it’s at. Education on adhd. The trend of it all right now is like other have mentioned, a double edged sword. You have people who think it’s cool and will pretend to have it, for whatever reason their unconscious mind has chosen. It’s caused even more people to look at us with discontent - But with that negativity, comes more awareness and understanding from the outside as well. And a lot of it.

Checking off tasks also gives you a dopamine spike which helps you continue to get things done. But it can turn a day of ""I have so much to do!!!!"" Into ""I have 2 #1's today. Anything else is gravy."" Writing down your tasks also keep them from ruminating around your head. This habit doesn't form overnight (partly because ADHD prevents us from forming ""habits"" the way others do) but over time it will release so much internal stress."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I was diagnosed late but pre-TikTok/adhd online virality, just barely. I wonder if there actually was a noticeable uptick in diagnosis, especially for adults, prior to a lot of this content taking off? Like maybe a movement within the mental health/medical community to look for symptoms in their adult patients? My doctor completely floored me by diagnosing adhd but we were dealing with years of anxiety and depression that meds couldn’t touch. ADHD made sense to her and now I cannot believe no dr before her ever saw it. My doctors now are like lol yeah obviously. 

It is frustrating to have it treated as a trend, but I do appreciate the broader understanding I get by seeing other ADHD folks’ experience. I think the weakness comes from the anecdotal “do you do this? That’s ADHD!” 2 people with ADHD can have 2 diametrically opposed personalities, habits, etc. ADHD doesn’t make you messy or super organized, always late or always early, forgetful or extremely precise. The ADHD makes the executive function and processing in your brain not work right. How you compensate, cope, or mask to deal with that deficiency is going to look different and sometimes completely opposite in different people. So it’s helpful to me to see people who aren’t the stereotypical adhd “personality” because that can be validating as someone who went undiagnosed for so long.  But from the outside, it definitely comes across as every quirk, habit, or outright normal behavior is a sign of adhd and that’s pretty frustrating when it’s used to undercut the validity of your diagnosis."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I’ve been diagnosed for more than 10 years but the little videos made me realize some of the things I did/experienced were ADHD symptoms as well, like rejection sensitivity. I found it enormously helpful. There are numerous, huge problems with creating ADHD content that’s meant to entertain/gain viewership at any cost, but overall awareness and education I have to say is better, not worse. I’m glad it’s not still 2010 and anyone diagnosed later/today I hope would agree."

My sister has 'ADHD' but it's only the fun quirky stuff like 'oh yeah I'm super obsessed with FNAF  cause of hyperfixiation' or 'oh I have so many random hobbies lol' or 'oh yeah I'm so creative haha' And its really annoying because she doesn't need meds and now my mom is convinced I don't need the either and keeps bringing up how I should stop taking them

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I just wanna say that the journey to finding the right medication can be very long. There's no single right solution for anyone and everyone's bodies react differently to medication. 

When I was first diagnosed, I tried about 5 different ADHD stimulants. They all gave me horrible side effects and weren't always the most effective. I stopped taking medication for about 10 years because I didn't want to deal with it. Just recently started up again, and my current doctor recommended doing a Genomind test. It tests your DNA against a bunch of pharmaceuticals and will tell you if a drug is effective or not, if you're at high risk for side effects etc. It even checks to see if you metabolize drugs quickly. 

It was really eye opening for me, because it turns out, that all those stimulants I tried before, none of them were recommended for me based on the test. So now I'm on a regimen of 3 different non stims plus some supplements. With exercise and good diet, I'd say my ADHD is about 65% - 75% managed. It's still not great, but I'll take it. Highly recommended the test if you're able to do one!"

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I hear you. Medication wasnt my end all, be all treatment for adhd. Ive learned coping mechanisms along the way. I literally put everything in my calendar so I dont forget. Keep some pads of papers around your house so if you need to do something and youll probably forget, write it down. A lot of ot is being honest with yourself and being realistic with what youre capable of. If you know youre over extending yourself, tell your wife. I know I need a cool off time during times of transition. As in, if my partner comes home I need a good 30 min to warm up to tne change. If Im already overwhlemed with tasks, I tell my partner I am and to not take ot personally. Its just about being proactive and constantly having a dialogue with yourself and checking in while also being honest. Ask yourself, if I say yes to that, am I really going to remember? Did you remember the last 5 times? If ots a no, I eother put it in my phone calendar with notifications or set in alarm in my clock. Im not perfect but as you do on, youll find cooing mechanisms tnat work for you."

I'm in highschool and got recently diagnosed. On 10 grams of focalin. 

I'll miss school assignments, test dates, NAHS meetings, ARD dates. 

It's embarrassing to explain that I didn't bring the project because I forgot it was due when it's written on all three boards of the classroom in big red lettering

I've forgotten what class I was going to between class periods and gone to the wrong class during the SECOND semester. That's one of the most embarrassing moments of my life. ""You've had the same classes at the same times for 6 months and you're going to the wrong class?? What are you, stupid?"" 

I've experienced ADHD paralysis (or something similar) in the middle of assignments. Something about stopping in the middle of an AP chemistry quiz unable to move your hand to write as you turn the gears in your head to figure out this subject with so many other thoughts clogging up your mind doesn't seem very efficient. 

I've cried because I NEEDED to get up and walk around, to move, to do SOMETHING but I was too embarrassed and locked my joints to prevent me from getting up which only made me start crying. I just start tearing up in the middle of spanish class before being given permission to go to the nurse. (I didn't go, I just came back after stretching my legs) 

And in my opinion, the worst part for me personally when it comes to school (not including personal life, I'll get to that) is the fact that I cannot for the life of me remember formulas or times tables. It does not stick with me at all. And that makes my AP classes all the worse because we don't get formula charts or times tables or calculators. Geometry was a nightmare of cheating for formulas and begging for calculators (thank god my geometry teacher understood my issue after trying to teach me times tables in NINTH GRADE and failing) I could've done great on my own with those resources.

At home my mom is convinced im just lazy and constantly berates me for it. I can barely find and keep a hobby which upsets me greatly when I'm bored and nothing holds my attention. I'm an aspiring manga artist because im good at drawing that style but its hard to draw when I want to, much less when it's my job. 

And tasks are always complicated. If the instructions aren't clear and detailed I seem to ALWAYS do it wrong. People say I lack common sense when I just followed the directions given to me. 

""Hey, go wash the dishes in the sink""

- Okay

""Why didn't you wash the dishes on the counter and stove?""

""It should be common sense that if you're washing dishes you wash all of them""

- but you didn't say that

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"the stigma surrounding ADHD and the general populations misunderstanding of it, and the way it is treated, is miserable. 

I know that the post is tagged as empathy/support, but I am curious - did you titrate up and then back down to 20mg adderall or did doc just stick you on that dose and call it a day? your descriptions of your prior interactions with him sound like a similar experience to what I went through. Titration should really be the first thing you and your doctor work with when trying to work out ADHD medication and dosage and if he didn't do a titration and you feel it isn't working, you might just literally not be taking enough. **it is very possible that you simply optimize on a much higher dose than what you are taking**. I think especially for hyperactivity symptoms, higher doses tend to work better than what is needed to manage inattentive symptoms. Every single person responds to every single medication a little differently though, so its worth talking to doc about starting to **titrate dosage up to see if it helps, if you didn't already go through that process.** 

on a different note - even though I am currently in a good place with managing my ADHD on the day to day, I still find that oftentimes what hurts the most is not having a place to feel comfortable being me in. I am very large - 6'1"" and 220lb - and 99% of people I have ever known have an automatic fear reaction when I am upset over everything. Even my partner gets mad because I scare her when I am upset. I have never hurt a fly. never hit another person. I have never been violent in my life. When I am angry or stressed or sad, I have a tendancy to stomp around, slam a few doors, yell ""FUCK"" etc. It isn't directed at anyone or anything - but it is sometimes an unconscious behavior and sometimes I don't want to act that way but struggle to control it. I get especially frustrated because when my 5'4"" 120lb partner is pissed off and slams doors, huffs and puffs, whatever, nobody gets scared. my/her parents will think its funny, ask whats wrong, say ""haha, someones having a bad day"" but if I behave the same way everyone locks themselves in their rooms or gets all scared and concerned as if I my behaviour indicates that I'm any more dangerous in that state than she is. I am not. I just need to be pissed sometimes?? apparently im not allowed to be though.  

It seriously sucks because I'm not hurting anyone and sometimes I just really need that? I can't be on my medication all the time and for whatever reason, shouting the f-word and slamming a few doors seems to me like a better way to cope with my problems than drinking/MJ, yelling at my wife, fighting with people, hurting others, falling into a depressive spiral, venting/self loathing, etc. but this behavior is disruptive and scary and as such, I am simply expected to be different. 

I feel this way with a lot of things. Sometimes I just really need to be loud, need to slam something down in frustration, need to talk without interruption even if the other person isn't really listening and just decides to smile and nod. but nobody is okay with this or wants to deal with it so it can be really hard to find an outlet. When managing my symptoms I don't want to ""be better"" for other people, i want to be better for myself, and for my behavior that isn't harmful to myself or others, I wish that I could simply be accepted for who I am. unfortunately most people aren't willing to create or deal with that kind of an environment. 

point in this being - the way that I cope with this part of my adhd is to find a place to be me. I am very fortunate to have found a medication and dosage (concerta 36mg) that I respond well to, and which allows me to be different and function a little better during the times when I need to function well. I think that maybe this would be the first step for you if you haven't already gone through strategies to do so with your doctor. However, medication is not an end all be all solution, and coping with the sometimes more embarrassing parts of ADHD is and was, for me at least, a matter of finding people and places where it's okay for me to behave in ways that would be ""embarrassing"" in other situations. 

**TL,DR;** sometimes, no matter how embarrassing, you have to be you. while I find that my medication, therapy, and other strategies are very useful tools in managing my symptoms, **no amount of medication or masking will provide the accepting and liberating experience of finding a person and a place where you can be you without needing to worry about your behavior for a little while.**"
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Yea it kinda sucks.  I was musing on this today how all of the sudden overall mental health ""struggles"" are the hot shit.  Which is great if its a genuine and honest kind of exchange.  Overall it puts these issues into the spotlight to have more dialogue.  It's great.  Just that this flood of user generated content is missing that honesty.  So much of it has some sort of other agenda - attention for personal reasons over trying to spread a message.

Though I do recognize that I'm jealous for how long I've struggled in this life, doing the work to make and find my way, and see that somewhat trivialized by a lot of these folk treating ADHD like the next bandwagon.

I completely understand what you mean.

A lot of them were about things like ahdh paralysis/executive dysfunction, switching tasks midway through and not going back to finish the first one, constantly forgetting things,...
So there are some good contentcreators who help spread awareness.

I'm going to add that at a young age, I was way to hyper and unfocused. I didn't listen for shit and I pissed alot of people off. When my parents took me to the doctor you know what the doctor told them? Straight up said I was showing signs of sociopathy and I would probably be in jail or prison before I hit the ripe age of 18.

Growing up I tried to open up to my mom about how I was struggling; she got mad when I forgot things, or was late, or didn’t get perfect grades, but she wouldn’t acknowledge how I was struggling. When I was old enough to know what ADHD was and I understood that it was possible I had it (esp. considering 2/4 other people in my family do) I told her I wanted to be evaluated for it. She said there was no way I had it, because my father and older brother both have it and they “act completely differently.” Spoiler: it’s because they’re more hyperactive while I’m more inattentive, and people also just think women can’t have ADHD. 
I was only finally diagnosed when I had the freedom to seek out a psychiatrist on my own. I was seeing her for anxiety but after a few appointments of hearing my symptoms and knowing my family history, she was the one who brought up the possibility of ADHD.

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I can relate so hard to this post, when I went to the public psychiatrist in Norway I was told that I was just lazy and was bad at making decisions in my life. I told her this was insanely difficult for me and it was almost like a mental wall holding me back. At this point in my life I was nearly dropping out of high school and in a state of depression. To study I would need huge amount of caffeine or the use of stimulants (which were expensive). Was even sent to another ""ADHD Specialist"" in Norway and was told that as I had no symptoms as a child I could not be diagnosed. And it was difficult to diagnose since I was having difficulty with depression and that it couldn't be distinguished from ADHD. Was basically belittled and told I was incompetent. Meanwhile I've fully learned how to replace a head gasket on a volvo (finished mostly but didnt finish the last part like finding oil leaks and replacing gas tank, as I've had no motivation even though I've wanted to finish it)  


After one appointment with a more expensive psychiatrist in Brazil, I was diagnosed with ADHD and am now put on medication. Although I feel a bit of imposter syndrome, the diagnosis makes sense as I've had other friends with ADHD telling me I've most likely had it / called autistic growing up. I'm now coming back to Norway and am looking forward to do my last subjects as they were split since I had been gone for so long. Will need to retake some exams too but am finally looking forward to the spark in life again, with the motivation to become an engineer and study"
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Yeah, I'm happy that people have de-stigmatized talking about mental health. I'm not happy when people say, ""You have ADHD if..."" and then name some stuff that could be anxiety or a tic disorder, or a wide variety of diagnoses listed in the DSM.

It truly doesn't help. I've lost out on some great opportunities because of my ADHD. I'm also not being perfectly dosed with my meds. I'm still struggling, too."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I was first suffering with depression symptoms right when it started being talked about online. I was also a bit of an edgelord back then and thought all these people online were just pretending to be depressed for attention. Whenever I would question my mental health I assumed I was just being influenced into feeling that way. Some years down the line it became VERY obvious that I had real issues.

A bit into my adult life now and I'm struggling with ADHD like never before, borderline mentally crippled, and I have to remind myself at times that I'm not falling for trends with ADHD."

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Yeah I’m conflicted cuz the only reason I realized I had adhd was because so many of these made sense. I then checked with my university counseling department, my pcp, and a psychiatrist who agreed that I did have adhd. I’m glad for the awareness but it’s so hard to be taken seriously for accommodations and things. Like I’ve seen people be like “I went to 3 different psychiatrists and all of them wouldn’t diagnose me” like then maybe you don’t have adhd??"
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,The opposite side of being sidelined is that having access to so many resources to help with understanding family with ADHD.

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I'd been putting off getting diagnosed as an adult for decades, expecting to be told to stop looking for attention, or drugs, or what have you.

Once I got to it a month ago, it was like bracing yourself to push a heavy door to fall flat on your face because it was actually a curtain. The provider who diagnosed me was pretty much ""what took you so long?"" 

It's been a relief, though I'm still in a bit of a shock."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Yes and now whenever someone chimes in saying they’re also adhd I try to figure out (without sounding condescending) when they were diagnosed. Usually I’ll bring up meds and they’ll say “well I’m not actually diagnosed but……” and when they’re done telling me about how they’re adhd I immediately tell them to get an appointment for testing. This usually gets them to shut up OR if they’re truly wanting advice, I just gave it to them lol"
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,""" a new star sign "" hahaha."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,My most recent psychiatrist said their clinic has stopped diagnosing and treating it because there are too many cases these days...
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I second this. Back when I got diagnosed at 8, adhd was not understood properly, neither by school nor by my psychologist. I love that people seem to have a better understanding of it nowadays, but at the same time it is very frustrating to see all these online trends saying 'everyone has adhd'. I felt so horrible and wrong for having it. Furthermore, I was put in 'special classes' which completely alienated me from my peers, making them think I was some mentally unstable child, all the while my biggest dream was to just 'be normal' and fit in. Instead I was bullied and looked down upon. As long as I've known this diagnosis has only made my life worse, so it really upsets me when I see people neglect all the trauma that can come with having this and growing up feeling misunderstood"
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"It really bothers me how all the co-morbidities that somehow don’t get represented.

40% of people with adhd smoke.

50% of people with adhd have a learning disability.

27% of children with adhd have a conduct disorder.

15% of people with adhd have a substance abuse disorder.

Then there’s the overlap with other neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders.

These people just don’t get it. They don’t get how much *work* we have to do just to live a regular life. It’s selfish."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"My ADHD is too bad to even have the wherewithal to start a TikTok account about how it inconveniences me (it more than inconveniences me).

It takes forever for so many reasons."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"It makes you feel like your healing is entirely your own to deal with, and no one will even glance to offer reassurance 

I’m one of the lucky ones where medication works (to a good level, nothing amazing, except when I need to hyper focus). 

Even still, creating all of these routines is a messy process, the concept that my life needs to be scripted in a repetitive book (work, adult life, responsibilities, finance, my own health) is the complete opposite to my instincts, 

you can go too far in one direction and hyperfocus on the distraction right before the task 

But for me, I noticed how blind the disorder has made me at times - I am noticing objects now that I completed filtered to my unconscious mind as they weren’t “relevant”, I am mostly calm, even when fatigued, I feel far more in control of my own brain, I’m now aware that I’m quite a smart person, my thinking is just too fast for my own good sometimes, it is now structured, and more resilient 

all the self learnings I have gone through solidified at once, I’m now a little too hyped up with intensive energy and need to learn how to harness it 

If it didn’t work, and I was maybe just one more adverse life event, I could spiral fast, I am very lucky to the safety nets that I have, even if they are imperfect"
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I had to go to mental health in grad school because I was only sleeping 2 hrs a night, and then would wake up and have severe anxiety. I told the psychologist I felt like I was obsessed with time. I would freak out when something was due, or I had to be somewhere. 

I cannot sleep the night before a plane flight, even if it’s not until the afternoon the next day. I’m so afraid I will not wake up to my alarm even though I know I’m a light sleeper. I think that was a key sign of oncoming ADHD, but the psychologist missed it. 

I’ve learned in the 10 years since how to deal without medication, but it’s hard, and I feel like I have ruined a ton of relationships due to my mood swings and outbursts of emotions that to me, are meaningless, but to others they think I’m going off the deep end or something. I hate it."

I'm late 40s, well educated, but never had an explanation for why I've struggled with *everything* my whole life (outside of good grades). It took having two kids who don't even present the same as me to look into it. If my oldest didn't have combination ADHD with the external hyperactivity I still think I'd be in the dark.

For my age, inattentive ADHD, especially in girls with good grades did not exist. ADHD and Autism were cartoonishly represented.

Just being able to give myself some grace instead of constant shame and self loathing is worth it. I still do, but maybe a little less and I don't let others knock me down as much. And more importantly I'm working on helping my kids understand themselves like I never had a chance to.

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"This  is me too, but interesting that I see the TikTok memes as similar to my childhood mental-health denying environment it that they seem to trivialize it at something everyone has. So, the mental health denial I experienced was ""oh, that's just normal to not sleep (like from infancy)"" or ""everyone is different, you're just different"". Leading to a lifetime of coping, burnouts, breakdowns, meltdowns, chaos, etc. But wondering how people actually get sh\*t done. I mostly kept it together until I had a full time office job I've been like ""I have no clue how people manage to work and do ANYTHING else"". And, I'd say this to people who would respond by looking at me like I was from another planet as though it was possible or even ""easy"" to do this. I don't get this sense of actually seeing or describing the real impairments that come with ADHD. It was only once I started reading ACTUAL scientific descriptions of ADHD that it started to click, because I just don't identify with someone that ""loses their keys"" or whatever. That does not actually describe what is happening inside my messy, messy brain. So, yeah, the social media descriptions just have the same feel as ""oh that's just a normal thing, isn't that different"" that I got my whole life. Which is to say I worry that it might not actually prompt people with more moderate or severe ADHD to get tested - I needed to understand in more detail what it actually might feel like."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"This is 100% me. I'm glad for the awareness because I would have never suspected it. I thought all ADHD was hyper active, and I only get little spurts of hyperness based on stimulus... But inattentive... 100%."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,That is very different than letting tiktok convince you that you have adhd because you like a certain color.
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I feel the same way. I was embarrassed for a long time I have it because of the stigmatism associated with it. So as I got older I started to view it as us not filtering so much stimuli all at once instead of “you’re missing a part of your brain”, or “you are deficient” because that makes me embarrassed/ ashamed."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"It’s a mixture of both honestly. When I was younger (about 7 or 8) my mom had me tested and she found out I had ADD. She didn’t believe in using medication to treat it, and I was so young I really didn’t know anything better and just went with it. She told me when I was older she didn’t need medications so she never bothered to help me with it. She still believes that to this day anytime she brings up “how my meds are going” because she still thinks this is something I’ll just grow out of at 30 years old. 

My TikTok FYP doesn’t really get flooded with ADHD content. It’s not that much at all actually and I usually only see a few videos a day on it. However, the videos I do see are always centralized in the same concept of “Here three reasons why you might have ADHD” and they have no credentialing to support their data. They list highly mundane activities that are mostly normal to the average person, or are completely inaccurate in what they describe. For example, a lot of them will talk about how organized they are. Organization is great! Is that the primary reason someone has ADHD? Not at all. Being organized is important for people who do have ADHD in the sense that, like me, if I don’t make lists or keep myself organized for chores or daily activities, I’ll be lost and it’s impossible to get on track again. But just saying “I like being organized” doesn’t mean you have ADHD. Then you see the comments are all “wow I had no idea I had ADHD, I’ve been very organized my whole life” and this starts the trend of misinformation. 

This post wasn’t meant to attack people for spreading information. It’s the spread of misinformation from people who use their ADHD for clout, or are trying to use their platform to diagnose people who aren’t licensed to do so. And then it makes people who actually do struggle with ADHD come off as if their issue isn’t real. Specifically why I said my coworkers tell me I’m autistic and just laugh. It’s hurtful and aggravating."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,Are you really questioning the validity of people who manage to get a psychiatrist to prescribe to them? That's really different than what the OP is talking about.
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"No gatekeeping in this post at all. If you believe you have a disorder, you should consult a medical professional what I disagree with is those who find a minor inconvenience in their daily life that they want to assume is a form of either autism or having ADHD, and not the fact that maybe they just forgot to do something one day. 

Furthermore, non licensed laypeople on any social media platform should not be providing information to the public persuading them they have any sort of disorder. If people want to cope, they cope however they find is necessary. If someone shares information stating they have a degree of some kind and the information is valid, that’s different. This post is regarding the accounts who discuss their ADHD for clout, views, and provide false information in the process. It’s truly disheartening to see people discuss their ADHD in a way that is not actually ADHD and is instead something completely unrelated. 

Yes there’s useful information available almost anywhere to the public, but there’s also TONS of accounts created just to spread false awareness on what ADHD is. And this isn’t specific to ADHD; this goes for other neurological disorders and how it’s glorified to the point where it comes off the wrong way. That’s all this post is about. Not gatekeeping any information here. I want those who need help to get help, not turn it into a fashion statement.

ETA: I also work in an emergency department and see this for too often in the workplace. Most of the time when people come in with their diagnosis, it comes from a TikTok that is not accurate to the diagnosis they were hoping to receive. Some people that have had a headache for two days claim it’s a brain injury and demand to be seen sooner than others. Their source is usually either TikTok or a blog post written by a non licensed professional. We run tests, scans, and find nothing. We usually don’t see them again and if we do, they come back with a different issue unrelated to the previous one with the same sources that misled them in the first place."

I miss that ability to go turbo, but as I got older the cost of it was so clear that I now recognize it as a bad thing."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I originally thought of my hyperfocus that way too... because my memory is so shit and I'm not self aware at all, so I'd celebrate how amazing it was that I could clean the whole house within 1 hour.... completely fucking ignoring the fact it had been in a terrible mess for 2 weeks."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,I was diagnosed as a kid but my parents stopped having me take Ritalin after 2 years without explaining why so i figured i didn’t actually have it. Then I realized I do recently after talking to my doctor and it’s such an akward timing…
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I believe it is both overdiagnosed *and* underdiagnosed, depending on where you are and what demographic you're part of. Research in my own country show this at least. Boys are over diagnosed with the hyperactivity version but underdiagnosed with the inattentive version. Girls are generally underdiagnosed in both. 

My theory is that the increase in diagnosing ADHD right now, is mainly because of all the adults who went undiagnosed their whole lives and now are made aware. The increased focus on women's health, have brought the lesser noticed ""versions"" of ADHD, OCD, autism etc into the light, for both sexes. All those who previously were just ""chronically depressed"" or had anxiety for some rather unknown reason, have now gotten a lot of help and inspiration to fight more for their case and actually figure out what is wrong, instead of getting a ""pathological"" diagnosis, that is ""We have figured out that you are struggling but we haven't a clue why""."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,It’s under diagnosed for women though.
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,Same. I wish people with ADHD would realise that a) tiktok is an absolute trap for people like us and b) tiktok is not real life. If you keep consuming media that makes ADHD sound ~quirky and silly then yeah that's gonna colour how you feel about yourself. You CAN curate your social media feed. I consume content related to my hobbies and things that inspire me. I block stuff that makes me feel crap. And I try not to give a fuck about what other people think about ADHD. I am open about it because I'm not ashamed. And being open about it helps other people.
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,It’s not a spectrum. Check the DSM.
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,its the teenagers that really absorb this crap
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,The rule is to not encourage self-diagnosis. Having respect for one another is something that we should do as a community. People on their journey towards a diagnosis often self-identify with ADHD before seeking professional help; those folks deserve the same respect as everyone else. We should respect everyone and encourage everyone to seek a professional for a proper diagnosis.
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Absolutely agree. I don’t know everyone’s story and can’t jump to conclusions on everyone based on a 30 second video. It’s the ones that don’t support their evidence with factual data and come off as more of a “trust me I know what I’m talking about” that get to me. If someone makes a TikTok that is meant to “diagnose” others, at least provide information that is truth to the diagnosis and not information that they just believe is true. 

In part I feel like these people are almost excited to be diagnosed with it and that’s what gets me. This isn’t anything to be excited about and I don’t understand why it’s being glorified lately in this manner."

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Well, depends. I wouldn't so readily disregard the struggles of some to get diagnosed when they very well may have it. Gotta take it on a case by case basis. Sure, also likely they may have other conditions that present like ADHD, but as long as they aren't taking the situation lightly and trying to get diagnosed just because of a trend, I'd side with them."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"My theory is that tech/social media *is* impacting general population’s attentional processing, people are noticing, and then identifying with ADHD because it uses some of the same descriptors. Not realizing that actual, diagnostic ADHD is not just a short attention span from too much tiktok.

Same thing happening with other disorders. Someone feels depressed for a few days and for good reason, identify with major depressive disorder, which has criteria of months of sustained depression. Or mild neurotic traits identified with OCD.

There’s overlap between the language that describes the traits and which describes the true disorders, but that overlap does not account for the stark contrasts.

We need quality mental health education in schools, and it’s just not happening. Most teachers wouldn’t even be able to teach the nuances."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Same! I was watching those ADHD tiktoks for like 2 or 3 weeks like, surely everybody identifies with all of these right?? Talked to some friends, nope. So I'm in grad school, and my anxiety was really starting to push me over a ledge. Made an appointment with a therapist, and I did not even mention anything about ADHD, and within 15 minutes of our first appointment she told me she suspects I have ADHD and working on strategies to manage it will give me the most help. So honestly, I can't be mad at the content out there because it helped me identify my ADHD and get help."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Yes...but there's a difference between a psychiatrist saying you don't have ADHD, and them refusing to even evaluate ANYONE for it.

I ran into the 2nd type, and I called 15 different shrinks in my area and NOBODY would give me (or anyone else) an evaluation.

I think that should be illegal.  What would the AMA say about kidney specialists suddenly deciding they won't evaluate people for kidney stones?  They know it's a real thing, that people suffer greatly because of it, there is treatment available that can be life-changing, but they refuse to help.

Fuck those shrinks.

EDIT: Changed a word"
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Same with me. My mom once said in my teenage years that ""ADHD is a comorbidity that occurs with autism"" and so I never thought of analyzing the symptoms. 5 years later I had a wake up call from all the situations, saw these symptoms and most of them matched, they existed in me as far as I can remember in my life. Got an uncle of mine to diagnose me (he's a psychiatrist, lives in another country, so I just called him up one day and asked ""what if it's true"") and it turned out to be real.

The day my mom knew it, she was broken as she couldn't understand how to get rid of it. The day I got to know was when I realized how I wasn't the mistake here, and how it's all something not so under my control, I couldn't believe how much lighter I felt that day.

But to get an official diagnosis to start medication, I had to do the same process, counseling services, PCP, psychiatrist. The first one literally said on a video call that ""well I don't see any symptoms when I see you, which can be described as ADHD, so I'm going to ask you to pay for a test I'll be giving, we can then continue the discussion"". Searched for another one who then did that in a couple of minutes that I met them and agreed to start with medication. 

> Like I’ve seen people be like “I went to 3 different psychiatrists and all of them wouldn’t diagnose me” like then maybe you don’t have adhd??

And I think most people don't realize this, but there are many other disorders that mimic ADHD, like bipolar. Impulsivity, depression and hypomania, with frequent concentration issues, that's basically the same symptom set. Some have both of them. Bipolar is generally ignored and never given the benefit of doubt because it sounds scary and people want this cool ADHD tag, like srsly what??"
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Same situation on realizing huh, a lot of these things hit home for me. I already have a psychiatrist for other reasons, so I brought it up with him, expecting a full evaluation, or at least a discussion about why I think that. Instead he just said ""okay, let's try you on this med first."" I'm so confused - did he just already agree with me from working with me, and it was one of those things he already knew but didn't bring up until I brought up my impaired functioning? Do I have an actual diagnosis now or not? The most confusing part of all of it is that earlier in the visit, he made an offhand remark (not related to me) about it being frustrating when his patients google stuff and self diagnose. Then I ask for an evaluation and he just hands me meds immediately? So strange."

Doctors did not consider how ADHD affects people who aren't prepubescent white boys until recently and a lot of doctors are still very uninformed and go by outdated information.  Every Psychologist who's expertise is ADHD I've seen has said that the name is misleading and the symptoms listed in the DSM are very limited and lack nuance. 

Every other day you see a post of someone getting denied a diagnosis for dumb reasons (because they did well in school, they're not fidgety, I saw one person say their doctor said they couldn't have ADHD because they had a job?), people getting denied meds they've been taking for years once they switch doctors, sometimes even the SAME doctor will do this shit, or now how since we are in a shortage we have a million stories about how people feel judged when looking for the meds they were prescribed.

My doctors would just straight up change the subject and refused even evaluate me or refer me somewhere. Like yeah the Tiktokers are annoying but at the end of the day ADHD was never taken seriously it's just a different font now, instead of ADHD being the ""boys will be boys disorder"" it's now a ""tiktok attention seeking disorder"".

I feel like this sub sometimes underestimates just how unreliable the medical community can be for people with ADHD, the reason why there's so much misinformation today is that a lot of people just don't have support outside of online because doctors don't give a fuck. They don't know what it looks like adults, and I think a lot of them lowkey just don't believe its real. The stigma is really bad."

When I went to psychiatrist not only she had no idea adult ADHD is a thing but also seemed to actually have undiagnosed ADHD as among other things she came late to every appointment and then after two appointments stopped coming to appointments altogether.

When I tried to get registered there first and was asking around about doctors specialising in learning diabilities the receptionist told me that learning disabilities are for students and adults just have to work.

I’ve spent 30+ years kicking my own ass and telling myself your just not trying hard enough if you do your best you can do it just try harder till it’s just about broken me. It’s when I got to this point I realized that something’s wrong and always has been but I was unaware. Having a diagnosis so there’s a reason and for me an understanding of why I’m the way I am in and of itself would be a huge relief.

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I do think creators online have a responsibility to recognize that their audiences, especially on TikTok, are primarily young people who are easily influenced. Especially if they have a large platform. Certainly it's not acceptable to present a short list of ""possibly"" ADHD traits in your video and assert that people DEFINITELY have ADHD if they experience them. Sometimes you can tell someone is not trying to be helpful, but just trying to generate more attention and clout.

But if medical professionals fail to take me seriously because people are spreading misinformation about ADHD online, I really just interpret it as a failure on the medical professional's part. It's absolutely infuriating that a person who spent an absurd amount of time and money to get through an education so they could diagnose and treat ADHD (among other things) might think I'm lying about my experiences because of idiot kids on TikTok. That my care might be impacted because my doctor was influenced by fucking TikTok makes me want to scream, to be honest. And that's on the doctor, in my eyes.

Same with your coworkers, too. If they minimize your problems or fail to believe you just because of some idiots online, many of whom are teenagers or very young adults, that's really just a reflection of your coworkers. That's not to say I don't understand the frustration, though. But I think the majority of these people genuinely think they have ADHD, and they're so used to recording and uploading everything about their life, but never stopped to consider that what they're doing could have real consequences.

On another note though, have you really noticed no change at all while on these medications? Not even slight clarity, or fewer concurrent trains of thought? That's really interesting, but I hope you find something that works for you soon!"
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"It's strange that our experiences are so different, considering tiktoks algorithm is very specific it really pushes adhd content to me at the minute but I have seen maybe 1-2 people in dozens that I thought ""hmm this doesn't seem like adhd to me"". But like... I'm also not a professional is the diagnostic space and everyone's adhd presents differently.


Also, my psychiatrist said the dsm needs updating again to reflect some sort of comorbidities. While he couldn't use them in particular for the actual diagnostic criteria, he did tell me eating disorders, skin picking, overly self critical thoughts, and sensory overwhelm are extremely common in those with adhd. So if for example you see a tiktok talking about adhd and their disordered eating, someone without it might (correctly) think ""well that's not adhd"". Because it's not, on its own, but the DSM is so particular that many people might discount themselves, so it's a good baseline of other common symptoms (but not diagnostic criteria ones) to help people.



When you say, people who think they have a disorder should consult a medical professional, what that originally looked like to me was going to my GP, them googling a list in front of me, asking me 6 random DSM based questions that are very ablist and narrow questions in the first place, and saying I have a masters and don't fidget enough so I can't have it. It was only after enough exposure to seeing what common other issues among adhd people are, did I feel confident enough to advocate for myself and pay to go private, bypassing the need for my GP. And like... my psychiatrist also has adhd so it's not like education = no adhd. 



One common comorbidity probably doesn't mean jack shit, but when they continually add up and compound then yeah, you start to realise and do more research. Even without tiktok,the idea of doing your own research can be taboo to doctors, but i would not have been diagnosed without it, i would have just believed ""well they say i dont fidget so i guess im out, i guess im just shit/lazy that it seems so hard to do basic shit everyday"". Especially among women I do believe we don't have enough exposure, I don't care if there's a small bit of misinformation in there as well. Women are more likely to be missed in childhood and have longer time to develop comorbidities which compound and mask everything making it very hard to sort through. Random ass videos making light of things and showing things that aren't necessarily adhd on their own, but common to some people with adhd, can be very helpful."

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Yep as a woman who was diagnosed at 34 after a lifetime of being given every antidepressant and anti anxiety medication under the sun, I personally think complaining about there being too much ""hype"" etc is male privilege... There are so many of us that NEED to see a lot of representation of what this shit looks like in women,and especially audhd women because some elements mask each other"
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Yeah claiming it's ""over diagnosed"" makes me uneasy because there is recent research that has led to a correction in generations that went under diagnosed. A ton of people are getting diagnosed who should have been decades ago. The more recent understandings also show that it doesn't manifest the same way in everyone (that people who do well in school or at work, or who can keep down and organized can easily have it). The pandemic put all these people's coping mechanisms and masking skills to the test, too. I did ok without medication until I didn't."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Yes this. I have had several different diagnoses over my adult life (anxiety, depression, dysthymia etc). Finally halfway through the ADHD diagnostic process at 43 years old.

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"It is a spectrum in the sense we can have different types, different primary symptoms, varying degrees of those symptoms, and different display of those symptoms.

""A spectrum disorder is a mental disorder that includes a range of linked conditions, sometimes also extending to include singular symptoms and traits. The different elements of a spectrum either have a similar appearance or are thought to be caused by the same underlying mechanism. In either case, a spectrum approach is taken because there appears to be ""not a unitary disorder but rather a syndrome composed of subgroups"". The spectrum may represent a range of severity, comprising relatively ""severe"" mental disorders through to relatively ""mild and nonclinical deficits"".[1]"" (Wikipedia https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_disorder)

Plus the DSM is a diagnostic TOOL. It doesnt show the reality in full ~ and experts in this field of research have stated as much. It needs another update already, even though they have been continually doing so because the research coming out has been completely shifting the view of ADHD (and other disorders). Like ASD, there is a similarity in the cause of the dysfunction in our brains BUT how that presents for people is VASTLY different. There is also not exactly a set ""cut-off"" in reality where we can define ADHD and non-ADHD - that is entirely an arbitrary standard set by the individual doctors interpreting the DSM."

I don’t like people treating any kind of neurological difference (ADHD, autism) as a “superpower”, but it was a fucking RELIEF to realize the reason I was struggling so much with school and holding my life together after high school wasn’t my fault and there were things I could do to help myself that were more likely to work for my brain.

When I finally reached out to someone to talk about diagnosis, he laughed in my face and said it wasn’t possible for me to have ADHD bc I “didn’t suffer enough during childhood from ADHD symptoms”, completely ignoring the things that were ignored bc I was sociable and always had good grades as a kid. Seeing lesser known symptoms of ADHD on social media and talking about how I related to those experiences with other people who were diagnosed with ADHD helped me immensely."

I also think self diagnosis is troublesome for not only this reason (the tiktok reason) but also I know how it's changed my life being diagnosed and medicated.

EDIT: bolding for emphasis. I'm not saying you shouldn't be medicated for ADHD if you have anxiety. I'm saying that if there's a possibility you *don't* have ADHD at all, but you *do* have anxiety, stimulants are likely to make your other problems way worse. So caution makes a lot of sense."

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Heyo, psych student w/adhd here. In psychopharm we learned quite a bit about nicotine and adderall. With folks like us, there tends to be a big shift towards both drinking and smoking, but for different reasons.

Smoking nicotine is easy to understand, it's a CNS (central nervous system) stimulant and promotes dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin just like adderall (except we also discovered it to be significantly more addictive). 

Whilst drinking tended to have a more social or societal reasoning (especially since alcohol is a CNS depressant, which would otherwise make issues with adhd worse if it weren't for the addition of the norepinephrine release that also comes from it).

Alcohol is seen as a socially acceptable way of hand waving all the downsides or perceived effects of adhd and the ability to ""unmask"" ones own symptoms under a veil of ""oh they're just drunk/buzzed"" which when said aloud is quite depressing. Folks with autism also tend to suffer with alcoholism as well due to this too.

prescription medications such as adderall tend to be a way of turning folks away from the addictiveness of nicotine, caffine, and alcohol. This is done with the aid of supervision by a doctor or clinician to observe the effects different medications have on the person with adhd's body. Some medications like ritalin and adderall run the risk of jacking up certain people's heart rate or causing too much dopamine to flow through the brain that they lose their appetite. Sometimes doctors shift towards SSRI'S to target specifically serotonin in an attempt to see if just raising one chemicals level will produce the desired effect while reducing the side effect burden.

Suffice to say, prescription drugs are far from perfect. And if you have a doctor that doesn't listen to you, tell you the interactions the drug has with other chemicals, or even asks about your current diet (spoiler: acidic foods and carbonated beverages shorten and dull the effects of adderall, ritalin, and many other CNS stimulants which may be the reason OP doesn't get any effect out of any of the drugs they have taken) Then it can be excruciatingly difficult to trust them. However, prescription drugs for adhd also tend to last a lot longer, and if tailored right to account for your own personal profile (genetics, other medications, doctor-patient communication) then they can end up garnering longer lasting relief with a lower chance of addiction, or even a better medication overall that actually tackles the pharmacokinetics/dynamics of the issues that are causing your adhd symptoms.

Hope this helps, and remember: always ask the doctor for the interactions, diet, and pharmacokinetics/dynamics of how the medication you are being prescribed will effect you. There are a lot of clinicians out there that will forget, neglect, or have never really understood/learned about the prescriptions that they are giving you (college tends to teach to remember connections, not explore concepts. Which tends to lead to bad diagnosis and treatments. But there really is no where else to go (at least in the U.S.)😥)."

The problem with diagnosis at a young age is that it's harder for kids to explain what going on in their head, and they don't notice that their behaviour is out of the ordinary so it needs to be caught by someone else.  An adult can communicate much better and has a better reference of their abnormal behaviour.  Besides, I have predominately inattentive type, which is almost never caught in childhood."

Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"When I was maybe idk 19 I was lucky enough to get a brain scan done by my childhood psychologist (the guy that diagnosed me when I was 9) for the price of a normal appointment because… I guess he just like, wanted to do it?  Idk how that works but he had the equipment so both me and my brother got one done.  

Even before the results were analyzed, with him just watching the screen, he was able to see abnormalities indicative of ADHD.  I was just sitting there with the electrodes attached to my head, and in between him constantly telling me to “stop thinking” (apparently it only works if you don’t think, they can tell whether you’re thinking or not, and I found it very difficult to NOT think for more than 2 seconds at a time, but I digress) he told me a few things along the lines of

“wow, you definitely have ADHD!”

“Yep there’s the ADHD!”

“Wow, no wonder you can’t sleep!” 

The machine would also make a little ping every time I blinked… it was trippy.  

After the results were recorded and analyzed and put on a bunch of fancy colored charts the verdict was yes, ADHD, but a specific type of ADHD where I have excessive beta waves in the back of my brain (they are mainly supposed to be relegated to the front) (also it might have been the other way around idk but there were too many beta waves SOMEWHERE).  Another interesting tidbit, he told me that a colleague of his who had also reviewed the results pointed out a part of my brain and said “this person struggles with social skills.”  It was a part of my brain responsible for recognizing facial expressions or something.  My psychologist said it was “similar to what people with autism have.”  Well lo and behold when I was 21 I was diagnosed with autism by another psychologist.

Then after the testing I had to follow up with my therapist and PCP for more questions before they would start medication treatment. 

However I know a lot of people who have been diagnosed other ways, either through process of elimination where treatment for other potential diagnoses failed so they try ADHD treatment, or people whose doctors just ask them a few questions and then give them a diagnosis, and even some who are just given medication without the diagnosis. I’ve even been told by other doctors since my diagnosis that there is no formal testing for ADHD and the testing I did was fake or unnecessary. Obviously it wasn’t fake and there is formal ADHD testing, it just doesn’t appear to be as widely used. 

My testing was also very, very expensive even with insurance, and there’s a lot of insurances that won’t cover it so that might contribute to the differences in testing and diagnosing as well."

Could be that there's no test that distinguishes ADHD from non-ADHD well. There's a lot of overlap, since ADHD is just regular symptoms that get bumped up to the point where they cause problems.

In think that’s actually the same combo a good friend of mine is on for his ADHD and anxiety. He told me that Wellbutrin basically saved his life. 

For me I found meditation was huge in treating my anxiety. It’s corny but the Headspace app made a massive difference in my life. Well that and a great psychologist."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Totally fair point, everybody's body and brain work differently.

I'm still on Vyvanse actually but the anxiety has mostly gone away.  Thanks for the recommendation for Adderall, I may try that too.  I also took Dexedrine a couple times recreationally in university and that didn't give me any anxiety at all, so I want to try that again.

Thanks for you suggestion."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"That’s why my PCP made me go to a psychiatrist. He was pretty sure I had adhd, but I also had a history of anxiety, and he said that he would rather a more experienced person handle it"
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"They do give the wrong prescription, it doesn’t necessarily mean it was your fault. But, It is hard after being dilated to judge sometimes. I was just saying that’s how they gave my kids prescriptions by watching how light reflects in their eyes, because they were so young. 
It’s also not unheard of for the lab to mess up the rx. If you do get an incorrect rx, they should re do it for no charge. I worked for an eye Dr that always did."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"That’s what i had to do for my testing about 6 years ago! Most other people I know who have been formally diagnosed went through some form of interview or therapy that led to the diagnosis, or it was a process of elimination over many, many years and symptoms crossing off the boxes. But anyone I’ve mentioned the computer part to with having to click for the numbers and letters looks at me like I’m making it up, so I’m glad to finally hear I’m not the only one who was diagnosed that way!"
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,So interesting! Thanks for sharing
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Remembers me of when I was in a clinic and they were still treating me for BPD and depression back then (misdiagnosed, turned out I never had BPD, it was ADHD).
And they were wondering why I was so forgetful and thought depression might have caused it. So I had sit at a computer and had to train my attention span every day with tests like you described.
Had to remember colors of cars and houses, click on numbers when they pop up and so on.

Months went by and I never got better at it. They were confused and didn't know why and assumed I hadn't tried enough. So I felt terrible for being ""dumb and lazy"".

Looking back it's kinda funny knowing it was impossible for me to succeed."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Yea I know, its an antidepressant that gets prescribed off label for it sometimes, especially to ppl who also have depression."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I’m currently in my PCP’s waiting room for a month after follow-up on how my new late afternoon/early evening Adderall bump is working with my Vyvanse.

My prescription insurance finally made their decision to deny covering it last week.

‘Merica!

Also, I tore a meniscus last October. All the hoops my insurance made me go through meant I didn’t get surgery on it until May."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,Kinda similar here. I was on waiting lists for about 2 and half years after I went to my doc about it. He told me how long the NHS waiting lists were and gave me a referral to private healthcare and it still took ages. I got a phone call about an appointment eventually back in October and then finally got diagnosed about 6 months later. I'm currently still waiting on titration as well since the start of the year and I have no update when my first appointment might be for that stuff. It really takes the piss and things don't get any better in all the time you spend on waiting lists
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,Your adhd symptoms have to be unmasked for you to ever end up in that scenario in the first place though
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,Yeah I wasn’t actually talking to you. Like Dry-Interest said… that was basically my point.
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"So you’re mad because I literally replied to someone else’s comment, and not yours? Just because you wanted to argue? I’m not sure how to say “I wasn’t talking to you” without it being taken personally. So like, sorry if I hurt your feelings “bud”"
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I’m glad that Headspace works for you! Honestly, some of the corny things really do help. I don’t much anymore, but I used to gratitude journal a ton when I was in the thick of it. 

Also I’m very much in agreement with your friend. I was terrified to go on Wellbutrin, but I’m so glad I did. I would go so far as to say it’s the reason I can say with like 95% certainty that I won’t wake up the next day unable to get out of bed"
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Wow my heart goes out to you 

I’ve recently started mixing short acting Dexamfetamine with my higher dose of Vyvanse 

I am not there yet, I want to replace Clonodine with Intuiv, but I’ve never been closer and I can begin to create habits, I’m slowly learning how to balance this with energy crashes"
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I ended up going private, I live in London and my borough actually got funding cut for the adhd program, meaning I got kicked off of the two year waiting list never to be considered again. Obviously they didn’t even notify me of this! So I was sat waiting round like a mug for a year. I saved as much as I could, sold possessions and did a bit on credit card for private. Saving money with adhd is excruciating, impulse buys were my bread and butter."
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"That’s the thing that really sucks is that they don’t offer any help at all while your on the waiting list, they just expect you to continue and be fine which, at least for me, is not the case lol"
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,True true good point
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,Mmmk bud
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"That’s so wrong, they don’t treat it seriously at all and it pisses me off so much, how hard is it for the government just to invest a little more money in the mental health services etc, it’s not like they’d do this if you had a broken leg or something, you wouldn’t be on a waiting list for years and then suddenly kicked off it!"
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"That's ridiculous honestly, I don't see how they can do that and just kick you off without notification at all. As another guy replied,they wouldn't kick you off if you had a broken leg. Mental health services arnt great at all with the NHS, it sucks. And I know the pain of saving too, any time I attempt it doesn't last longer than a few days at most. Impulse buying is my kryptonite. Thankfully I'm private and it's through the NHS right to choose I think? Helps a lot but still takes way too long"
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"Yep, pretty much. Far from the case with me too, things are very much not fine and even if you try they usually continue to be not fine most of the time. Just told your on a waiting list and that's it until you randomly get a call a couple years later that you probably forgot about and didn't expect for obvious reasons xD"
Having ADHD feels embarrassing now because of the “hype” around it.,"I know, it’s quite savage to say the least. It’s definitely a government issue though, I doubt anyone who works for the nhs can say they want to deny people of the care they need. But it does vary as well, someone I know went to them with depression/anxiety issues and the gp told them they were just lazy (their exact words) 

That’s great you got through with right to choose, I’m now on shared a care agreement so I can get my prescription for the regular price"

Anyone try Gabapentin or Guanfacine for sleep?,"I’ve been use gabapentin on a non-regular basis but my issue is waking up in the middle of the night and not being able to fall back asleep. So, while gabapentin helps me get to sleep it does t really help me stay asleep, I don’t think. I’ve been on this journey for awhile and have been hearing good feedback on using cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia which is a specific modality of CBT. You might want to look into it if you think your sleep issues are chronic or at risk of becoming chronic if your body gets accustomed to to the behavior of your impaired sleep patterns like me."
Anyone try Gabapentin or Guanfacine for sleep?,Ask for trazadone. I take guanfacine and trazodone before I go to sleep. Knocks me out.
Anyone try Gabapentin or Guanfacine for sleep?,"I took gabapentin for a little bit years ago and honestly never noticed a difference (take that with a grain of salt, it was 5ish years ago and I barely remember it), but I recently got on buspirone (for anxiety so idk if that applies to you) and it's been life changing. I take 10-15 mg about 1.5-2 hrs before bed and I'm able to fall asleep within 30 minutes, versus hours of tossing and turning every night. I also take two to three 5mg doses during the day, and I also take Adderall XR 10mg and IR 5mg"
Anyone try Gabapentin or Guanfacine for sleep?,Gabapentin really works well for me. I use it for sleep and breakthrough anxiety
Anyone try Gabapentin or Guanfacine for sleep?,"I’d recommend Clonidine instead of Guanfacine for sleep. Just trying it out now. I found Guanfacine made it easier to fall asleep but I’d often wake up in the middle of the night. I take it in the morning now. Both Clonidine and Guanfacine can help with anxiety, which it sounds like you may be dealing with."
Anyone try Gabapentin or Guanfacine for sleep?,I've heard good things about busiprone. I do think I have a bit of anxiety but I think it's caused by the ADHD and insomnia so I think it's secondary....but maybe that doesn't matter? I'll read up on it. Thanks
Anyone try Gabapentin or Guanfacine for sleep?,"I've heard good things about CBT too, I've been looking into it.
I have problems with both falling asleep and staying asleep so it might be worth checking into more. Thanks"
Anyone try Gabapentin or Guanfacine for sleep?,For some reason I'm scared of trazadone. Can you quell that fear for me?
Anyone try Gabapentin or Guanfacine for sleep?,Extended release guanfacine for ADHD or just the immediate release to help with sleep?
Anyone try Gabapentin or Guanfacine for sleep?,Is it something you can stay on long term?
Anyone try Gabapentin or Guanfacine for sleep?,Thanks for that. I'm going to ask my Dr about it when I see him Friday. I haven't slept in days and just had a complete breakdown at my new job from exhaustion. So embarrassing.
Anyone try Gabapentin or Guanfacine for sleep?,Tell me your fears and maybe I can quell them
Anyone try Gabapentin or Guanfacine for sleep?,[removed]
Anyone try Gabapentin or Guanfacine for sleep?,I guess just for sleep it’s the regular 10 mg doesn’t say extended release on it
Anyone try Gabapentin or Guanfacine for sleep?,"I've been using it for more than a year now. My doc hasn't mentioned any need to get off it, and I have no side effects. Of course, everyone is different, but it works very well for me."
Anyone try Gabapentin or Guanfacine for sleep?,Get Clonidine for sure. Best sleeping medication I’ve ever taken
Anyone try Gabapentin or Guanfacine for sleep?,Mainly that antidepressants can cause anhedonia. I had it caused by my ADHD and Adderall is helping with that. I never want it to happen again.  It's awful.
Anyone try Gabapentin or Guanfacine for sleep?,Aaagh yikes. That's bad. Thanks for that info.
Anyone try Gabapentin or Guanfacine for sleep?,I’m taking it for adhd and for sleep. I’m only day two and it’s working for me. The second night more than last. I’m very sleepy and relaxed.
Anyone try Gabapentin or Guanfacine for sleep?,Will it be OK even though my blood pressure is normal? And would it knock me out too hard that I wouldn't be able to wake up if my 5 year old needed me to wake up?
Anyone try Gabapentin or Guanfacine for sleep?,"Will trazodone can be used as an antidepressant. It’s also used as a sleeping aid. Anti depressants are very beneficial for helping depression and anhedonia. You just need to talk to your dr and say what’s working or not working.  As far as the sleep, though trazodone does wonders for me 
  
I take an antidepressant called Wellbutrin for my depressive symptoms."
Anyone try Gabapentin or Guanfacine for sleep?,Yeah it’s amazing.
Anyone try Gabapentin or Guanfacine for sleep?,"That was a big concern of mine. I have a three year old. I take 0.1 mg and I can wake up just fine for her.

Regarding the BP, you’d just have to try it and see what happens."
Anyone try Gabapentin or Guanfacine for sleep?,"Thanks for that.
I'm guessing lack of sleep is going to lead to anhedonia too. 
I tried Wellbutrin but it didn't work for me. Though I did sleep better on it.
Why does everything have to be so freaking complicated?"
Anyone try Gabapentin or Guanfacine for sleep?,"It sucks man. But just keep working at it. Took me a while to find the right medication. But I learned I have to be more upfront about what I’m feeling on the medication and relay that to the doctor. The doctor does not know my whole personality or how my body works. 

Sleep is very very important. I would address the lack of sleep ASAP because it’s probably affecting other areas of your mental health.  Actually, it sounds like it is affecting your mental health.  A good night sleep as you know is a game changer. 

I would call my doctor today or as soon as possible and see if they can prescribe you something to help you sleep. That is very important right now. I wish you the best of luck.

“Dr I can’t sleep it is affecting me poorly. I need to address this asap.”"
Anyone try Gabapentin or Guanfacine for sleep?,Thanks for that. Yeah it's definitely affecting my mental health. Unfortunately where I live Dr appointments take weeks to get. I have one in three weeks so hopefully I can use that time to get as much info as I can. Thanks for all your input.
Anyone try Gabapentin or Guanfacine for sleep?,Have you tried melatonin or any over-the-counter sleep aid?  I really feel for you because I experienced bad sleep for like 2 to 3 weeks until I got trazodone. I know how it can be.
Anyone try Gabapentin or Guanfacine for sleep?,"Yeah, I've tried all the natural, over the counter stuff. Nothing works. Time for the real stuff I guess! It's such an awful feeling. So much more than just being really really tired. I hate that you had to experience it too, but it does help when someone really knows what I'm talking about. Thanks."

Guanfacine or Wellbutrin? Thoughts?,"Im not sure if this is helpful but for the longest time I thought I had depression, but really it was ADHD and Wellbutrin weighed me down and made it worse. I now take Focalin for ADHD and Anxiety and it works really well!"
Guanfacine or Wellbutrin? Thoughts?,Why is your doc not using stimulants? Why is he going for off label and third-string options?
Guanfacine or Wellbutrin? Thoughts?,"I'm on Guanfacine, it works well for emotional dysregulation, but it doesn't do anything for concentration, motivation or attention span. I still take a stimulant for those. Guanfacine doesn't compare."
Guanfacine or Wellbutrin? Thoughts?,"It's a game of trial and error. Wellbutrin helped my focus but made me the saddest version of myself. Guanfacine was great for my RSD, but I was constantly dizzy since it lowers blood pressure. 

The best combo I've found is ritalin for adhd, and lexapro for my panic disorder and to smooth out the edges of the ritalin. 

Are you unable to try stimulants?"
Guanfacine or Wellbutrin? Thoughts?,"My doctor is doing the same thing rn I'm on guanfacine, and it does nothing besides making me tired all the time. I've been on wellbutrin for years, and I don't even know if it helps anymore."
Guanfacine or Wellbutrin? Thoughts?,"I can't be on stimulants and I'm on Wellbutrin and Guanfacine to treat ADHD, anxiety, and PTSD. It also helps with my PMDD. It took months to find a medication that worked with my body and it's been a long road. It takes a lot of patience but you'll get there."
Guanfacine or Wellbutrin? Thoughts?,"Have you tried ritalin as well? Ritalin helps my adhd, but as someone with anxiety, I'm intrigued by the fact that focalin is less physically activating (at least from my understanding)"
Guanfacine or Wellbutrin? Thoughts?,"![gif](giphy|ChmEWOL7Vaz5u|downsized)

After discussing she wants me to try a combination of the two, Wellbutrin in the morning, Guanfacine in the evening."
Guanfacine or Wellbutrin? Thoughts?,Motivation and attention span are my biggest issues
Guanfacine or Wellbutrin? Thoughts?,I’ve never tried a stimulant before. I’m thinking my Dr is trying to start small and go from there.
Guanfacine or Wellbutrin? Thoughts?,Did Ritalin also help your Anxiety or no?
Guanfacine or Wellbutrin? Thoughts?,"Just be aware she's well off script here. Unless she discussed a health risk factor with you, she should be offering you a stimulant. They're the first line treatment for a reason. Atomoxitine is a fine enough second choice, but her avoidance of them is now calling her expertise into question"
Guanfacine or Wellbutrin? Thoughts?,"Yep, that's why stimulants are usually the first line medication for ADHD, and that's why I'm not sure why your doctor is giving you lesser options instead of giving you the most effective option first..."
Guanfacine or Wellbutrin? Thoughts?,"100% this.

 Hopefully this is because of medical history or co morbidity. And not gross incompetence in understanding stimulants as first line treatment."
Guanfacine or Wellbutrin? Thoughts?,I can't be on stimulants and I'm on the same meds as OP. To each their own.
