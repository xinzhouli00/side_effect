strattera,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I am a 28-year-old female with the inattentive type ADHD. For a long time, I was on 30mg of Adderall, and to say the least, it ruined my life. After 5 years of being on that crappy drug, I wanted to try a non-stimulant. My doctor prescribed me 40mg of Strattera. At first, the side effects were terrible. My mood swings were terrible, I felt dizzy, sleepy, constipated, and had a loss of interest in sex. The side effects only lasted around 2 weeks... then came the good part. All these side effects subsided, and I noticed how calm I was. Usually, I'm on edge. I also noticed that I'm more attentive to the things I need to take care of at home and work. I enjoy sex more than I did before, and I'm sure this med has helped me become closer with my fiance again. If you are suffering from ADHD and don't like stimulants, please give this med a chance. It is well worth it!"""
strattera,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I'm a 31-year-old male. I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder comorbid with ADHD. My doctors hence refused to give me stimulants, so they offered Strattera, and it worked like magic on the first day. No side effects. I feel more alert, more energized, and can continue to focus even during boring tasks. The real benefits are supposed to appear after 4 weeks. If after 4 weeks Strattera really does improve my ability to concentrate and my motivation even more, I would be really impressed. I will be updating this review as time goes."""
strattera,For ADHD,"For ADHD""This Strattera is the best ADHD medication I've had so far. It takes a LONG time to kick in. I was supposed to feel the full effects a month into taking it, but I didn't get them for maybe 2-3 months. However, it was worth it for me. Instead of just giving me energy and turning me into an emotionless robot like stimulants, it reworked my brain. My whole brain functions better now. I don't procrastinate, and I can pay attention and work better. I have branched out into different hobbies because it gives you motivation. This is in effect 24/7 because it doesn't leave your system or wear off like stimulants. Now, the side effects. I still zone out and dissociate. There is a decrease in appetite (not as bad as the stimulant in that area, though). I have vivid dreams/nightmares. I feel tired often, and nap a lot. Also, I feel more depressed in general. None of these side effects are very severe, but they can be difficult at times. However, I really do recommend giving Strattera a good chance."""
strattera,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I'm a 26-year-old AFAB (assigned female at birth) person, and I never thought I had ADHD until very recently. My spouse was diagnosed with hyperactive ADHD, and while we were researching it, I realized all the symptoms for inattentive ADHD matched me. I mentioned it to my psych, and after some tests, he diagnosed me with ADHD and put me on Strattera. It didn't kick in until week 4 for me, and up to that point, I had an upset stomach for about 30 minutes every morning right after I took the pill. But the nausea went away, and I began realizing that suddenly everything was so much easier to do. I started to notice how much time I was saving at work and doing household labor because I no longer got distracted or had to hype myself up for an hour before doing a basic task. I just would think 'I should do this thing' and then immediately take care of it."""
strattera,For ADHD,"For ADHD""At 32 years old, I was diagnosed with ADHD, which was a huge relief. I had always known that I felt different, and my behavior throughout childhood was questionable. It's sad to think that ADHD was never a recognized condition for girls back then. If it had been, I believe my childhood would have been very different. Strattera has changed my life. All the noise in my head, impulsiveness, procrastination, and extreme exhaustion have stopped. I no longer dread the days ahead or count down the minutes until bedtime. I am truly enjoying life. This drug is not a miracle, but when combined with positive steps, it has made me realize that I am equal. I no longer feel like an imposter or am terrified of social situations. The initial side effects I experienced were fatigue, nausea, and loss of appetite. However, for me, these side effects were preferable to continuing down a path of self-destruction and the inability to exercise self-control. If you are starting this drug, stay strong and have faith."""
strattera,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I am on Strattera 40 mg once a day for one week, then twice a day (80 mg) after. I'm 33 years old. Never been treated for ADHD before now. I have terrible anxiety, among other things. Today is day three on Strattera. I feel drunk when I take it. I don't like alcohol normally, but this feels like I drank too much. The first few hours are difficult. My chest feels heavy, and my body is tingling. I have constant goosebumps. I don't think it's supposed to be like this. Any advice??"""
strattera,For ADHD,"For ADHD""After 10+ years of unsuccessful psychotropic medications for various misdiagnoses and 11 years of therapy, my brain is quiet. At one point I was worried it wasn't working, but then realized I was only bored because I had actually finished all my tasks. I upped the dosage VERY slowly (over months) and have not had noticeable side effects other than nausea, which doesn't even occur if I eat beforehand. I recommend therapy on top of meds and sticking with it for months to give it a chance to work - finally having enough time to start living and not just surviving/the realization of what normal is can be an overwhelming process. Best of luck to you all!"""
strattera,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I’m a 26-year-old female, and I’ve been on 25 mg of Strattera for 5 months, so I feel that it’s safe to say this drug is SLOW. The results take a couple of weeks, and they are not too noticeable day-to-day. The definite way I know it’s working is when I look back on the last couple of months and see what I’ve gotten done since then. I’m doing a lot better at my job with a lot fewer errors, and my manager even told me to 'keep doing what I’m doing, you’ve made barely any mistakes in the past couple of weeks.' I’ve been painting and making art a lot more consistently. Chores still suck, and I procrastinate, but I can actually follow through on tasks. Please give it a chance past the days of weird night sweats, sluggishness, and stomach discomfort. It can be worth it. It’s not dramatic, but it’s enough to make a difference."""
strattera,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I’ve been on Strattera for almost a year. I am a 23-year-old female with ADHD. It took about two months to finally fully work, but when it did and I got over the side effects, I loved it. You will experience some nausea and stomach pain in the beginning and sweating or feeling lightheaded if you don’t take it easy. I recommend eating lightly with it and make sure you drink water so your stomach acid isn’t going toe to toe with extended release. You may vomit if you don’t take it with a little food. Give it time. I focus easily now, and my life has drastically improved. I’m getting my master's and work full time, and the medicine also regulates appetite and seems to raise the metabolism. Good luck!"""
strattera,For ADHD,"For ADHD""Game changer for me. 60mg for ~3y. Not a magic bullet, but without it, I couldn't be self-employed. I still lose days immobilized or where all I can do is a few emails, but compared to weeks of incapacity without it. For example, without meds, I can sit for hours thinking: 'I need to do the dishes [add mental distraction here & repeat].' Now I can go from thought to action; just get up and do the dishes! When I don’t take it, negative self-talk starts in my mind, from how frustrating it is to never shift from thought to action. I can really tell the difference. Advice: 1) REALLY important, titrate dosage up SLOWLY, for example, a few weeks or a month with 20mg, then 40mg, etc., to reduce any side effects. Don’t go too fast or start on the full dose. 2) I can't take it until AFTER I eat enough and wait for my digestion to awake, or I get nausea. I can’t just take it WITH food on an empty stomach or even just AFTER breakfast. So I eat oatmeal and take the pill later after mid-morning snack. Otherwise, I’d rate it 10/10."""
strattera,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I am 44F, have been on Strattera for 19 months. It took about 6-8 weeks to feel my best. After adjusting strengths, I eventually stayed on 60 mg. Focusing and memory is much better. Strattera is off-label prescribed as an antidepressant. Instead of trying Cymbalta, I recently chose to increase Strattera to 80mg first. It's been one week and my mood seems a little better. I have been really tired, not so tired that I don't get anything done. Caffeine seems to increase my heart rate. I have noticed acne breakouts on my face, chest, and back which did not occur with 60mg. Mostly on my face. I may be the exception. Strattera is worth a try if you don't want to try stimulants like Adderall. I wish you well on the arduous journey of finding the right med for you."""
strattera,For ADHD,"For ADHD""Nothing would quite fix me. Not antidepressants, or therapy, or Adderall. Depressed all the time, screaming on the inside. Had days I literally could not do anything. Unfocused at work, hated my job, life, and wife. Changed psych doctors, prescribed Strattera, titrated more slowly than the sample pack, got up to 60 mg. Way happier. Less sensitive - don't get hurt easily. Take criticism better. Wife notices a big difference in mood - always thought it was depression. It's ADD and Strattera is perfect for it. Just hope it keeps working!"""
strattera,For ADHD,"For ADHD""Do not let negative online reviews and personal anecdotes prevent you from trying Strattera if suggested by your doctor! Side effects: at first, I had some nausea, alleviated by taking after food. Now, after seven weeks, I take it at bedtime and have no side effects. I can already notice a real difference! I tried Strattera last year but only took it sporadically for a few weeks, not giving it a chance to build up to a steady state and take effect. This time, I have not missed a dose, and I am now at the full dosage for me (100 mg). In the past, I was prescribed Adderall. I was concerned that Strattera would not work for me because I had already experienced the rush of the onset of a stimulant medication. Adderall also affected my emotions/behavior in negative ways. Strattera is an entirely different experience. Even when I do not notice its benefits in the moment, I can look back at my day or week and see the difference in my attention/focus."""
strattera,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I had taken Adderall, Concerta, and other ADHD medications which all caused me to lose my appetite, get moody, or come down from it, and I felt I wasn't able to be myself. Strattera took a few weeks to kick in. I fell asleep constantly for the first two to four weeks. I know lots of people jump the Strattera ship then, saying it is not working or making them sleepy, but after 4 weeks, I started to feel like myself again. Except my mind got clearer, I could organize my room and now apartment, do all my school work, do everything I need to do, have better conversations, and do not binge eat. I take 40mg and have had no side effects from it. It also helps my anxiety. It is my miracle."""
strattera,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I've previously gone into psychosis, and my brain has changed, so I can't be on stimulants like Adderall. We tried Qelbree, but it had no effect on me. We started Strattera about 3 weeks ago, and it has done WONDERS. I didn't have an immediate reaction to it, but around 2 weeks, it was extraordinarily obvious how much of a difference it made. Before, I was doing 10 things at once and only partially finishing all of it, leaving everything a total wreck. I had horrible ADHD paralysis. I love to read and couldn't even focus long enough to finish a page. It's gotten extremely bad as I've hit 30. Just give it a good try and wait at least 2 weeks to gauge your results, it is most definitely worth it. And all the negative reviews? Just remember, people are always more likely to post a bad experience vs. a good one."""
strattera,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I have been taking Strattera 40 mg for a couple of months now and so far, so good. The main thing that I have noticed is how much calmer and less restless I am. I am not as easily irritated, I've been sleeping better, I talk slower, I interrupt less, and I fidget less. My cravings for salty, sugary, greasy foods have also decreased substantially, and I am more inclined to eat healthy and more nutritious or filling food. I have not noticed many effects on my attention span, so even though my body has slowed down, my mind still feels like it is zooming right along. For this, I have been prescribed a low dose of Vyvanse at 10 mg to take every so often (I took 40 mg Vyvanse for a few years prior to starting Strattera). I am also on 150 mg of Wellbutrin."""
strattera,For ADHD,"For ADHD""Our daughter started taking this medication in October for ADD after failing school. After a month, we noticed a huge change in her ability to focus and obtain excellent grades. She was finishing her work in class and doing extremely well compared to before Strattera. She just made honor roll and never fights or complains about school work anymore. Our only concern is that we’ve noticed our 11-year-old losing weight. She is skin and bones and has dropped a clothing size. She says that food isn’t good anymore and has to basically force-feed herself. I’m afraid we may have to stop the medication if this doesn’t improve, which is unfortunate because it has so many great benefits and has changed our lives."""
strattera,For ADHD,"For ADHD""Strattera is a wonderful alternative to stimulants. While unmedicated, I would consistently have brain fog and I would never be able to focus. I would frequently have to ask others to repeat themselves as I would always drift off mid-sentence. I never experienced hyperactivity. Every stimulant medication I tried (Adderall, IR Ritalin, Concerta) all resulted in anxiety and loss of personality. With Strattera, I feel as if the fog has cleared, while also maintaining my regular self - the most 'normal' I’ve ever felt. I’m currently on 80 mg a day weighing 175 lbs. It took my body roughly 5 weeks to become fully adjusted to the medication and receive the full benefits. Just make sure to always take this medication on a full stomach or you’ll probably experience some nausea. Also, the first couple of weeks I felt a little more agitated than usual, but this passed after the first few weeks. Give this medication a chance, especially if stimulants give you anxiety!"""
strattera,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I started Strattera 1.5 weeks ago. I started to feel the effects after 4 days. The effects were not subtle. It makes completing tasks easier and I can flip the switch between focusing and not focusing with less effort. I imagine this is what it would feel like to be normal. I am also prescribed 60mg of Adderall which I haven't been taking since being on Strattera. Strattera so far is more effective for me than Adderall. I feel more alert and less tired. It is easier for me to sit down and focus and I get less distracted. The frustration I normally feel when I don't take Adderall that comes from procrastinating and not following through is gone. At my next appointment I will be moving my Adderall prescription down to 30mg. I wish I had been prescribed Strattera as a kid instead of Ritalin and Concerta. It would have been a better choice for growing up on an ADHD medication and affected my personality less than stimulants."""
strattera,For ADHD,"For ADHD""Background: I was diagnosed with ADHD in my 20s and was started out on Strattera at 40mg. Now I'm at 80mg. Also, take with food or you may feel nauseous. Note: These are my own observations, your experience may vary. Pros: - It gives me an insane amount of energy and direction. Drives me off the bed/couch to more constructive outlets. - It makes me hyperfocused at 80mg and decently focused at 40mg. - There is no crash like amphetamines. Cons: - Some mild sexual side effects that disappear over time. - Weight loss - lack of appetite (Pro if you struggle with your weight? - just make sure you eat!) - Zombie effect - I noticed some kind of dulling of my emotions. i.e., my lows are not as low, but my highs are not as high. - Cottonmouth/dry throat. I'm constantly drinking water. - Possible sleep disruption if you take it late in the day."""
strattera,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I’m 18 years old, suffering from chronic depersonalization/derealization disorder (DPDR) and ADD. I was really thankful when I finally found out that I have ADD. It explained every aspect of my life that I, my friends, and my family couldn’t understand (you all know what I’m talking about). So I started using Strattera. On 10 mg, I didn’t feel anything. On 25 mg, I started having some problems with insomnia and a little bit of anxiety. On 40 mg, I finally got to know what real anxiety is. Staying up until 3 am, sitting on my bed with racing thoughts, fast heartbeat, and high blood pressure. Being sure that I have schizophrenia and that I’m going to lose control of my brain. Waking up a few times per night, sometimes with hypnagogic hallucinations and feeling like total trash throughout the next day. Also wasn’t feeling any relief from ADD, and my DPDR got significantly worse because of all the anxiety. Can’t blame the drug; every brain is different. I hope it will work for you. :)"""
strattera,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I got diagnosed with ADHD-PI (Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder predominantly inattentive) and chronic depression last year at 24. This is one of the best medicines for ADHD. I struggle with inattention and mind chatter all the time and have been in college for 7 years. However, last year was my best year in college when I was on Strattera (also known as Attentrol) with Wellbutrin. Don't lose hope and give it at least 8-10 weeks before you see the effects, and honestly, it is unreal and has worked wonders on myself. The side effects when I first started taking this drug were pretty intense the first week, but after that, I gradually started with 20mg a day to 60mg a day now. The mind chatter was gone in a week, with my attention significantly improving. We live in a society where patience is no longer a virtue and people want results ASAP. That will not happen with Strattera, but if you were to give it a few weeks, then you would exactly know what I am talking about."""
strattera,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I'm a 32-year-old male and have had symptoms of ADHD all my life, but chose not to treat it because the types of medications available seemed to 'take something away' from my personality. I finally reached a point that my wife begged me to do something, so I started with Strattera due to my doctor's recommendation. I've been on 40mg for 2 months now, and notice a major difference. I now have a desire to get on the floor and play with the kids, whereas before it seemed tedious and boring. I find that I'm not as tired at the end of the day/week because my thoughts are not distracted by all the 'noise' that I seem to have from the ADHD. I'm still new to the drug, and things could change, but for now, I am really happy."""
strattera,For ADHD,"For ADHD""It does work. But, give it two or 3 weeks. You will feel weird in the beginning and a little nauseous. It goes away. I do feel like I concentrate better and focus longer. Be careful with caffeine! It makes caffeine much stronger and lasts longer. After a few months while on it, I get very irritable and tense. I need a break and let it wash out. No problems stopping cold turkey. Take 80mg a day. Overall, it's good. Not perfect though. Orgasms seem delayed for some reason and slightly less of a sex drive. No changes in weight."""
strattera,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I’m a 28-year-old male. I’ve had ADHD since my childhood without hyperactivity. I tried Concerta, Ritalin, and other psychostimulants - it was a disaster, I felt like a drugged zombie. After a while without using any medication, I wanted to try Strattera to boost my productivity. Everything got worse since I started using it. It’s been 2 months now. I lost interest in everything and became severely depressed. I’ve had trouble sleeping. Social interactions became weird. I started turning inward and feel shy all the time. So I stopped seeing people for a while thinking it would pass. It didn’t. Ever since, it’s been downhill, my libido is at a dead point, my relationship with my girlfriend took a big hit, I lost my job, and things I used to enjoy seem to make me feel indifferent now. The only positive thing is I’m less hungry now, I feel less tired during the day, and I am a bit more focused while working. Otherwise, it’s been a nightmare. I stopped the treatment today."""
strattera,For ADHD,"For ADHD""Struggled with life at home, at work, with relationships. I have never taken stimulants, and I had anxiety and ADHD. Strattera has changed my life. Anxiety - gone. Attention - noticeably improved. This is a medication you have to be patient with. 1st 2 weeks - felt like I was going to pass out of pure exhaustion, constipation, felt zero improvement (40mg). 3rd week - anxiety amazingly disappeared (60mg). Realized my confusion was, in fact, anxiety (not lack of intelligence). Job performance - started seeing noticeable improvement to the point where I was amazing myself. Obsessive thoughts - gone. Can sit in my seat for longer periods of time and easily tackle many tasks like it's a piece of cake! Handle stress with ease."""
strattera,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I have been on Strattera for about 6-7 years now! I had developed a viral infection which caused disability in my legs, arms, and most of all, my brain. It can have some bad side effects. The best thing I have experienced from this prescription is that it's a very effective pill! It helps me focus more, relax, and control mood swings. When I need to focus or calm my anxiety down, I can rely on this medication. I have been on this medication for about 8 years now, and I'm 21 going on 22! A very effective medication!"""
strattera,For ADHD,"For ADHD""Female, 28, and have been on Strattera for 5 months and it has changed my life. Went back to college to finish my high school degree after having dropped out in year 9 due to pure inability to focus. I was always in a daydream before this med. Motivation is increased 10-fold. I also had panic attack disorder with half a dozen panic attacks every day. About 3 weeks into this med and the anxiety lifted. Anxiety is 100% gone. No other med in my life has ever done that, not even actual anxiety medications. I'm more social, have more energy, and general satisfaction with life. I am so happy with this medication and truly believe this is an absolute miracle medication. I think this medication is more for people who have ADHD-PI."""
strattera,For ADHD,"For ADHD""Sharing my experience and hoping other people will comment things they had in common with my experience. My doctor started me on 40mg of Strattera. The first few days I had so much energy. I cleaned my house at 5 am on my day off for no reason. About 2 weeks in, I started to feel drowsy. Anxiety has decreased a bit, but I feel tired in the mornings when I take it. My doctor is now saying she wants to up my dose to 80mg and that it won’t make me tired. I started taking the 40mg at night, and it not only makes me tired but also makes me agitated, and I can’t sleep."""
strattera,For ADHD,"For ADHD""26f (45kg), inattentive ADHD. Started on 25mg for one month, then raised to 40mg for one week now. At first, had bad insomnia and didn't notice any improvement. Then, the first thing I noticed (3 weeks in) was mood improved. I normally cry a lot, but I haven't cried since taking these meds. Relationships with friends and family have improved. Then, I noticed tasks have become easier to do than before. I can sit down and read, focus on conversations, and people have been responding to me more positively at work. The change is gradual and subtle, but I am very pleased with how normal this medication makes me feel. I would say my quality of life is improving significantly. I feel in control. I will titrate up to 60 eventually and probably stay on that dose. The only negative side effect is I'm having a hard time maintaining my weight. Even though I eat 3 meals a day, I keep losing weight :(. I still feel hungry, but maybe I'm eating less than normal without realizing."""
strattera,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I've been on every ADHD medication under the sun. After heavily abusing Adderall and lying to my doctors, I broke out in a huge body rash that went all the way up to my face. I didn't like the way Adderall made me feel. Like a zombie. I was wide awake, felt euphoric, but I didn't do anything. I just sat there for hours chain smoking while on my phone. I decided to try Strattera. I love it! It does everything Adderall did minus the tweaky stimulant effect. And, I can't abuse it :) My ADHD is under control, my depression disappeared, and I feel like myself again."""
strattera,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I wanted to do an updated review on this medication. I am in my 9th month of taking it, and before Obamacare, I ran out a few times, and the effects were very noticeable. Even though it is not supposed to have classic SSRI withdrawal symptoms, I still had severe brain zaps. I have my script filled, and I am back on it. I am such a better worker, listener, and planner on this medication. I am a better version of myself. Love it! I take 40mg a day, 60mg was too much. I am 160 lbs tall female, 34 y.o."""
strattera,For ADHD,"For ADHD""Big hint for everyone who is starting to take this medication: no caffeine and nicotine. I've been trying to hop on three times, but the first two I failed because of side effects. I couldn't sleep, heart was pumping, and my mood was not in the right place. This time I completely stopped taking caffeine and like magic - my sleep is better than ever, I quit smoking - my heart feels way better. It looks like Strattera makes caffeine and nicotine way stronger, so just stop and you'll see a miracle :)"""
strattera,For ADHD,"For ADHD""At 34, I started Ritalin. It had up & down effects. At 46, I began Strattera. Hated it. Gained 35 lbs, anxiety soared, was fatigued & lethargic. My current dose is 60mg 2x/day. I never lost weight, but I feel normal. I don't limit caffeine intake. I drink tea, no coffee. Anxiety & depression are better with Strattera. Just added 40 mg Adderall as menopause dulls the effect of Strattera. It has caused high BP & urinary retention. Yet I haven't stopped Strattera in 14 yrs as the alternative is dysfunction. With my daily dose (120 mg) over the max, changing insurance & MDs involves much hoop jumping. Cost of Strattera (& generics) is very high. Some generics are not as effective. Overall, give it time to become fully effective, carefully weigh pros and cons, don't expect to eliminate all ADD behaviors, set realistic behavioral goals, & closely monitor self. The med is NOT a panacea, it is one tool on the journey to living as your authentic self."""

I finally got tested and diagnosed with ADHD, and after doing lots of research, I decided to try Strattera. This is the first and only thing I've tried for ADHD, and I love it. I've been taking 40mg for two months and I've noticed a significant improvement in my ability to focus on and complete tasks without feeling distracted. It has calmed me down, and I don't feel as edgy and agitated anymore. I'm able to control my emotions more and feel happier and more at ease. So glad I moved forward with this!"""

strattera,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I am pretty much in love with Strattera. I am a 19-year-old female and was diagnosed with ADD around 8 months ago. The difference between my life on and off Strattera is huge. When I'm on it, I am so motivated and focused. I have a plan for every day of my life, and though I don't always get everything done on my list for the day, I at least try to be productive and I at least care about getting things done. When I'm not on it, I am a complete blob. I care very little about being productive and have issues even getting out of bed. Like, I will literally stay in bed all day. The only persistent side effect that I've experienced is dry mouth. If I miss a dosage and then take it again, I get super drowsy, but that goes away after a day."""
strattera,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I have been on Strattera for over a year now. I will be 50 in July. This medicine works well for me. My thought patterns were like a slot machine with three or more thoughts going through my head at one time. Now my brain is quiet. It's amazing. I sleep well because I can turn off my thoughts. I have lost over 50 lbs. due to side effects at first, but now it's because I find that I focus on what I put in my mouth. It is nice to be able to wear skinny clothes again. I only need to lose about 30 more. Try this medication. I can't imagine not ever taking it. It has been a blessing."""

This drug takes time to get into your system, mine took about 2 months, with some uncomfortable side effects at first, but once you overcome those, this medicine truly works. The problem is most people just want to jump to the next drug. I feel like a normal human being, I'm no longer extremely reactive, irritable, irrational, and emotionally all over. I have found to be emotional yet stable (I'm not just some zombie). I am not constantly making impulse decisions. I have improved my relationships with my family and friends and finally feel like myself and have control over my life. So great to finally feel and I hope many others find the same happiness.

strattera,For ADHD,"For ADHD""This is a miracle medication. I've been taking Strattera for 4 years now and it changed my life. I started on 40 mg/day and it first took around a month before I noticed the effects. I went from having a hard time focusing on tasks to being hyper-focused in such a way that it was almost scary. In the first months, the side effects were being sleepy and losing weight, and not feeling as much hunger, but on the same time, it was worth it because I could focus on conversations and reading and being more organized overall. The side effects progressively went lower, it took months to see the bright side. My doctor lowered the dose to 25 mg/day and I feel less sleepy now. The reason I took Strattera is because I have ADHD and bipolar and I had tried stimulant ADHD drugs and those did not work for me at all, they gave me manic episodes and made me even more agitated than I was before taking these.

I am definitely more focused and can stay on task when reading a book or newspaper article without anxiety and frustration of having to reread the same paragraph.

At 36 sought and got diagnosis of ADHD, and was put on Strattera. It helped very little with focus regulation, but it blew me away with how effective it was for depression. Clearly, I am an outlier in this (or it would have been approved for depression), but I was able to go off Prozac, thereby reducing daytime sleepiness. This, plus the way Strattera helped me fall asleep, has improved my focus somewhat. Strattera recalibrated how my memory encodes events. Within the first couple of weeks, I noticed that I no longer obsessed over newly-made mistakes. My fear of rejection is greatly reduced because I now have a proportionate sense of how much any given 'mistake' matters. This has reduced anxiety, too! We did increase early dosage too quickly, and as a result, I had some hypomanic weeks, during which I made some unalterable life decisions. Oops!"""

I have also been quite tired throughout. It's almost like being jet-lagged for 2 months straight. I'm very much looking forward to something different. I have felt zero psych effects.

It takes a while before you notice a change in the ability to focus. When earning my 1st degree, I struggled in school, probably all my life. While on Strattera, I could sit and study for hours and not be distracted. I went from struggling to earn C's, maybe a B, to earning A's and maybe a B.

Initially, I started with a 40 mg dose, which led to irritability, depression, and anxiety. After discussing these side effects with my doctor, I realized I had exceeded my optimal dosage. I am particularly sensitive to medications, so taking a month-long break from Strattera was necessary. Upon resuming Strattera at a reduced 18 mg dose, I no longer experienced the negative side effects and began enjoying the full benefits of the medication.

Without this drug, my mind really races and I can't help it with exercise and things like that to get the energy out, but I'm not on the same beat as others. When I take Strattera, everything slows down, and I'm on the same beat and wavelength as everyone else. Social conversations go better, and I'm able to stay on task with work and actually get things done. I've found taking it on an empty stomach can be a bit sickening, but other than that, no downsides for me. I take 40 mg 1 or 2 times a day as needed and find it wears off in 6-8 hours for me. I'm extremely ADHD but have no depression at all, a very happy person, always have been."""

For me, it takes a solid 8 weeks before the full effect of the medication kicks in to full potential. When it does, I have a superb memory through paying attention. My doctor increased it from 40mg when it worked well but not well enough, to 80mg. Then I had to restart the 8 weeks. Like the 40mg, I started noticing a difference in 5 weeks. After the 6th week, it's a perfect mix. Superb focus that seems to get better week after week. I'm glad I gave the Strattera a chance."""
strattera,For ADHD,"For ADHD""Before I start, I would like to point out that while I have never taken Strattera, my brother has, and it has completely changed who he is as a person. He was diagnosed with ADHD when he was six. We were so lucky it was caught that early, and after a few fluctuations in dosage, ended up on 35 mg a day. I can't even explain how much of a difference I noticed in him. He went from constantly hyper, selfish, and distracted (I understand that those were not his fault, though) to a focused individual with passions. Strattera did stunt his growth. He's been taking it for seven years now, and at age 13, is 4'6 and 70 pounds, but I think he would agree with me when I say it is so worth it; he often comments how glad he is to have it. Even after seven years, it continues to work well."""

Psychiatrist switched me to Strattera 40 mg x 1 mo. Side effects: sometimes morning nausea, intermittent dry mouth, mild constipation, took longer to orgasm, irritability. Increased to 60 mg x 2 weeks then was supposed to go on 80 mg. Insurance required a pre-auth, so went off entirely for 1 month (gotta love the US healthcare system!). Now, the last few days took 60 mg a day for 2 days, then 80 mg a day for 2 days. Side effects: extreme nausea 1 hour after taking, but was taking on an empty stomach, so will change that, dry mouth 1-2 times a day. Resting heart rate mid-60s. Haven’t tried sex yet, we’ll see. I am certain I am more focused. So far, I am happy with this. Worry a little about possible liver failure, but that is very rare.

I have moved a lot with my family between the US and Europe. I speak 3 languages. I managed to go to university to pass admission tests to the HTZ in Zurich (the third best university in the world), and I graduated with excellent results (as a construction engineer). I lead my life perfectly. The drug never gave me problems except that it helped me study when I was in middle school and high school. However, my doctor has opted to reduce the dosage of the drug over the years to help me snap from this. I sincerely thank who I am now and what I was able to do thanks to this drug. I think it is an excellent alternative to Adderall and Ritalin (among other things, Adderall is illegal in Europe and is classified as a drug like meth)."""

An 11-year-old child should never have to hear voices telling them to harm others or themselves, experience horrifying nightmares, and suffer from the terrible lack of sleep caused by insomnia. It felt like everything was blank, and I felt completely numb. I was like a zombie, devoid of any real emotions. Growing up, I thought I had anger issues as a kid, and to some extent, I did. However, this drug amplified my anger towards everything. I also struggled greatly with depression and had suicidal thoughts at such a young age. I came dangerously close to attempting it on multiple occasions, but fortunately, all my attempts failed. I am grateful for that, but no child or adult should ever be subjected to this medication. It made me feel absolutely awful, and I am still dealing with the trauma caused by the thoughts, voices, and memories I had as a child, even to this day. It took around 4 years to overcome some of the severe side effects from this drug as well. I apologize if my thoughts seem scattered, but I cannot stress enough: never take this medication. And please, ensure no child is subjected to it either."""

These side effects were not able to be relieved with painkillers, eating, or drinking. Then my dosage was increased to 40 mg. I was now experiencing insomnia, an extreme heart rate, and would often nearly faint when I stood up for too long or too quickly. I also started to experience depression and suicidal thoughts. I had my dosage decreased to 10 mg, but the side effects persisted, only to a lesser extent. Whenever I came off the drug, I immediately felt better. To anyone reading; I spent 3 months well aware of the side effects and common negative reactions because I desperately wanted it to work and to be one of the few that seemed to get positive effects, but this did not work out, and it caused a lot of unnecessary grief in my life in the past few months. Take care and caution."""

I started to not feel like myself. My head was completely empty. I felt like a zombie, tbh. I didn’t find things funny, and I started to lash out at people, which I never do. By like day four, I lashed out at my dad, and then I broke down. I cried and was becoming really depressed. When I went off of it, my imagination returned. It was kind of a scarring experience."""

However, the side effects outweighed the benefits. The most extreme side effect didn't really hit until about a month into taking Strattera. He became very emotional, would lash out disrespectfully, and within 5 minutes would be crying and saying how sorry he was. His brain clarity was actually WORSE. He has always been an honor student and suddenly couldn't remember his multiplication facts. The last side effect was his appetite was suppressed.

I feared for my safety and the safety of others so I stopped the drug immediately! I was having thoughts of violence toward others and myself.

Planning for the future is noticeably less stressful, and I even found it easier to do simple things like grocery shopping and coming into work early. I’m still not perfect because I have still missed a dentist’s appointment. I’ve also noticed fewer cognitive distortions, which makes things more comfortable. I will say that it still doesn’t help with the immediate distractions or impulses, like stimulants do. It takes some time for it to work, you have to take it every day, and you still need to live a healthy life. So even if it helps a little, it's not some miracle drug. Manage your expectations if you’re considering asking your doctor about it."""
strattera,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I suffer from drug and alcohol addiction, so it is important for me to steer clear of stimulants.

If you start feeling agitated by it, get off it immediately. For me, Strattera has worked wonders. I am 18 years of age and have noticed the effects after my 4th week of taking it. My mind feels clearer, and I feel more motivated to focus on things I would usually find boring. The effects are reflected in my ACT score: my score has gone up a whole 6 points since first taking it. I wholeheartedly recommend Strattera to anyone with ADD."""

This medicine takes 4-6 weeks to fully go into effect, and I will be waiting till then to see how it goes. Medicine works differently on everyone, so while some people think it's awful, others may think it's the best thing that's ever happened to them. If your doctor prescribes it, I suggest taking it and waiting till the 4-6 week mark unless it makes you physically ill, and even then, I would give it a week or two to see if it goes away.

I can separate and ignore the conversations going on around me, so much easier to be around a group of people and go to restaurants. This has been life-changing. I was told decades ago I had anxiety/panic disorder, but the meds never controlled it. Since I started the Strattera, my anxiety has gone from a daily 8/10 to 1/10.

I just feel like myself on it, but it cured my ADHD and rewired my brain. I feel like a new person now. No side effects except that I am sleepy if I sit still too long, but it's a good trade for life-crippling ADHD. It probably has bad reviews because people don't give it a fair 3 months to work. It takes a lot of patience and the initial stage is rough (lots of side effects), but it's 100% worth it."""

My current dose is 25 mg, and I also take Adderall, 10 mg twice a day. If I had to describe Strattera, it is a great focus/motivation medication, but it also ups the anxiety, and Adderall seems to up it even more.

strattera,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I only took this for 4 weeks, and most say it takes 4-6 weeks to work. Initial side effects: extreme sedation and emotional flattening.

That subsided a bit, but I remained very lethargic all day, every day for the duration of the 4 weeks, and as time went on, I felt more and more emotionally flat and lost all interest and motivation. It certainly completely cured my hyperactivity, but it never helped my focus one bit. It did, however, really help my fibro pain better than anything has, took away my panic attacks, and cut my general anxiety down greatly. Unfortunately, I can't continue to feel so flat, lethargic, anti-social, and disinterested any longer."""
strattera,For ADHD,"For ADHD""Strattera works well for me. Let's be straight with the facts, folk. Strattera should be dosed at least to 1.2 mg per kilo body weight or 80 mg a day (optimal dose for most people) - if you take less than 1.2 mg/kg, the risk is high that the effect that you feel is too low or placebo - (this is proven in lots of real-life medical trials). After about 6-8 weeks (during which your blood pressure is taken regularly) - its effect should be evaluated by your doctor - please have patience with the medicine to work. If the response is too low - it should be dosed up to 100 mg or higher. A doctor should know these things - it's mandatory in Sweden to have this knowledge, among doctors, below 80 mg a day is SUBOPTIMAL dosing. 100-120 mg should not be exceeded. This fact is in the 'medical sheet/package' with your medicine. Please inform your doc about these simple facts."""
strattera,For ADHD,"For ADHD""My husband has ADD, and it really took a toll on our relationship. He was originally on Vyvanse, but it suppressed his appetite horribly. It didn't do enough in ratio to the side effects, so he decided to try Strattera. So far, it's been working decently. His main problem, however, is being able to urinate freely. I bought him Urinozinc Prostate Formula, and literally the first pill he took, he was able to urinate much more easily. Conversely, when he forgot a pill the other day, he noticed an immediate difference, and struggled to urinate. The supplement has allowed him to stay on Strattera.

I had to eat with my dose, or else I'd get an upset stomach. Every 2 or 3 days for the first week and a half, I'd get chills that would make my nipples hurt something fierce (sorry for the TMI!). That became far less frequent and was a fair tradeoff to finally have all the noise in my head quiet down. Starting on Week 3, I felt like I was steamrolling the med a bit, and it wasn't feeling as effective, but I figured that I probably would need a dose increase at my follow-up. 2 days later, I woke up with a small rash, and by the following day, I was about 60% covered in an itchy rash and was miserable. I feel like the med itself worked, but my body just did not like it the more it got into my system. That feels more like a 'me' problem, so I didn't score too low."""

I also felt like a zombie for a couple of days, but that eventually passed. Although I still have a dry mouth, it is not as severe when I take antihistamines. One of the most noticeable changes is that my head space is now often silent, which is a strange feeling. I used to rehearse conversations in my head before talking to anyone, but now I can easily have conversations without any practice. However, I did have a moment of panic when I thought I couldn't communicate with anyone. Despite this, my conversations went smoothly, and I was able to talk without rehearsing any topics.

I will give a disclaimer: I didn't take it some weekends, but the lack of going to work and the deterrent of the side effects put it off. I didn't experience any increase in insomnia.

Then, last night, I started uncontrollably crying and thinking terrible, awful things about myself that I have never thought before. My partner said, 'That's the worst I've ever seen you.' I didn't take it today (I refuse to take that ever again), and after a week on it, I feel lifeless. Like a zombie. Like my personality, my thought life, my ability to function is just not there.

I changed the time I gave it to late afternoon and have not noticed this problem anymore. He is not overly drowsy at school. His teacher sent a note noticing he appeared to pay attention in class more, and today was the FIRST day since the school year started that he didn't get in trouble for disrupting class.

Find a good counselor that will help you and your child by giving you tools to use in everyday life, like learning to patiently wait, be a gracious loser, etc. As far as the Intuniv goes... My son will be 9 in a few months, and we are still only on 1mg. Don't rush to 2mgs without giving 1mg a chance."""

intuniv,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I would like to share my experience with Intuniv for those specifically with comorbid ADHD/Bipolar. It initially improved working memory (easier to take time to perform tasks such as not jumping ahead while reading), then, as it works on 2A receptors, created a DECREASED DESIRE to perform the tasks. Essentially, it lowers NE. So, lower motivation, which nearly completely negates the easier task performance. THIS IS A COMMON THREAD. Therefore, works better in conjunction with stims. It also created depersonalization. Finally, it caused a unique mixed episode with grandiosity and irritability, but psychomotor retardation and grumpiness.

He is still irritable at times, but this has always been a problem for him; I don't feel this medication has made it any worse. Last year, his standardized test showed below-basic comprehension.

Adderall has been a miracle for me. However, I have also always struggled with anxiety. I was actually initially hesitant to even try a stimulant because of this, but I find Adderall sometimes helps anxiety. All of this said, I eventually added Intuniv/guanfacine ER to my Adderall, and WOW, it was like the final 'missing piece' was found. I get the huge benefit of the Adderall without the over-the-top jitters and ruminations amphetamine can cause. Curiously, even my skin looks better (it has basically stopped the Raynaud's from Adderall).

My doctor prescribed this to me when the side effects of Concerta did not leave me; I had anxiety that was clearly not situational but from the drop-off of Concerta in the middle of the day, as it is not a steady released medicine but an ADHD medication that releases a dose twice."""

Prior to this medicine, in 1 year we had 6 inpatient stays and 12 CPEP visits. His other medicines worked, but we could not stop his impulse factor, which was putting his life in danger.

intuniv,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I have found Intuniv (guanfacine ER) to be a tremendously helpful medication. I take it with Vyvanse, 60mg/day. The primary reason I started Intuniv was because I was having issues with jitters and anxiety on the Vyvanse. It was frustrating, because I absolutely had moments where I felt great and had brilliant focus, but I would sometimes get stuck in these rumination loops, anxieties, etc. CBT therapy helped a little, but I saw Dr. Russell Barkley talk about how Intuniv can be taken WITH a stimulant to help with emotional control, so I asked my psychiatrist about it, and he knew all about Intuniv. I eventually settled on 4mg/day. I am WAY more 'chill' these days, yet still very much me. I just feel more level headed. The only downside is this drug can make you tired, and it can have a bit of a notorious hypotension side-effect. Occasionally, I would be tired and winded, which was not dangerous but from low blood pressure. Taking the medication at NIGHT has helped this completely."""

He grew 3 inches in 3 months and gained weight (which is great for him!). However, huge side effects are sleepiness, tiredness, and headaches (which he never had before). School work or homework remains undone. We have issues at school where teachers are complaining that he just does not care about anything and does not participate in class. We have huge issues with completing homework. I am very frustrated."""

This was only a day or two. We noticed a difference within days and a completely focused child! However, after a few weeks, he was becoming extremely obsessed with germs, constantly washing his hands. We counted 14 times in a 15 min span! His poor little hands were raw and chafed a bright red. It didn't matter, he kept washing. Our pediatrician referred us to a psychiatrist (as he had never experienced this side effect), and the psych said that it was due to the PDD. We took him off. If it hadn't been for the side effects, the Intuniv worked quite well."""

I refused to medicate him until after his first report card in second grade. I could not let his esteem fall from poor grades when we all know how bright he is. He started off with Vyvanse 20 mg. It worked well for him for the rest of that school year. The next year, we had to up it to 30 mg, but we felt it wasn't effective. This winter break, we started Intuniv. He is on his 3rd week. He has an increased appetite, focuses well, but is too sleepy in the evenings. He normally would have a hard time falling asleep. Now he falls asleep at the table reading by 8. I will continue the Intuniv, but hoping it gets better."""

They started him on Intuniv because he was unable to focus at school and extremely hyper. With him being bipolar, it is very hard for them to treat his ADHD because the stimulant medicines make him go crazy. He tries to hurt himself and others while on those. He is on 1 mg of Intuniv, and we've yet to see any good effects from it. He has never been able to sleep well, they told me this would help with that. But sadly, it hasn't. He is on a sleeping pill as well. He still tends to wake up very early in the morning. Some mornings it's 2 AM, some it's 4. They told us to go ahead and add another sleep aid."""

He is sleepy in the afternoons, but he also takes Clonidine along with this medicine, which also makes him sleepy. So I hope the sleepiness improves. He has started the last week having severe stomach pain. He gets up many times in the night saying his tummy feels funny, and he gets some diarrhea in the night. He also has a harder time staying asleep at night, which is new. Hoping the stomach pain stops so we can continue the medicines, as I feel they are helping him."""

Eventually, it did not work long enough, so we give him a wake-up dose of 5 mg IR, an 8 am XR dose, then a 3 pm IR dose to help with aftercare and homework. This has continued to work for 3 years. We tried Intuniv because his ODD and impulsivity were leading to threats of suspending him from school. After 2 days, we realized his BP was lower (too low), but he didn't pass out. After 2 weeks, his reacting to people was no longer on the calm side, he was emotional about everything, more impulsive, and more defiant, not him at all. We decided to take him off. At least we can say that we tried, but it just did not work for my son, but it may for others."""

Our son has been on the drug now for almost 4 years - he is on the max dose for his age (3 mg), and I honestly can't see if there is a difference. He has had no visible side effects - nothing like I have been reading about above. If anything, he has put on weight (it is not a stimulant).

Fast forward a few days, I still can’t sleep very much. I’m artificially active is the best way to describe it. I’ve been pretty inactive throughout the pandemic, but I walked to get iced coffee in 90-degree heat, cleaned my apartment, had people over, then went to the gym later because I was so jittery and couldn’t sit still. It also has given me quite a bit of anxiety and some irritability alongside the constant need to be active. I hope that over the next few days, the anxious thoughts, stomach issues, and insomnia calm down."""

I noticed a difference within the first day or two. The third day I woke up with tons of energy and unpacked my suitcase that had been sitting in my closet for a week, before I even started working! Unheard of for me. My outlook on life has improved, I don't snap at my husband, I don't get annoyed. Plus I've lost 4 lbs and my sex drive has increased slightly.

Honestly, I don't know if I need it, but Viagra works. I told my doctor that I'm okay but don't seem to feel any drastic change from when I first began the med. She suggested upping to 300 mg extended release. After a week, I began to feel better, but I don't know if it is from the med or the high of knowing I made the attempt at trying to feel better. Wishful thinking is a good way to put it.

Getting on it was a little strange, as I had some side effects of anxiety at first, but actually have not had a panic attack since starting. Just know that it doesn't really help with anxiety/OCD symptoms (but I've been going to therapy for that).

Finally, I realized the change: I was calmer, no longer judgmental towards myself, my unsatisfactory life situation, and my body. The anxiety and depression were gone. I treated myself with self-compassion and acceptance - all firsts for me! However, I also didn't care about exercising, and I've been an athlete and hiker all my life, so my energy level had evidently decreased. These past 4 months have been a lovely, gentle reprieve from the perfectionism and pressure I've put on myself my whole life.

It also has helped with my sex drive. It hasn’t helped my ADHD, and I also no longer have an appetite. Two days ago, I was bumped up to 300 mg a day, and the first day taking it, I went back into the same despair I felt, but the suicidal thoughts were worse this time, though luckily my boyfriend was there.

It felt like my eyes were being pulled up by magnets, it was hard to look forward, and I was dizzy. This subsided after a few weeks. My anxiety became way worse. Every day, I felt like all of my nerves were exposed. I overreacted to everything and caused a lot of fights. Then came the suicidal thoughts. I've struggled with these thoughts when I was off of meds, so to be flooded with them again was scary. These thoughts were invasive and more intense than I've ever experienced.

We were so excited to try Qelbree. But by day three, we had to stop, as it made him physically and verbally violent. We almost called 911 at one point... and he is only 9 years old.

However, he was happier than usual, slept better, and gained weight (which was a +). He increased to 200 mg just before the start of school, and within days, high anxiety, fear of school, failure, and schoolwork, cried nightly and each morning. He is academically gifted, and school is exciting and fun, never scary. This was very concerning. After 2 weeks, we are certain it is manic episodes brought on by Qelbree.

It was nice that it worked all the time, but that is where the positives end. For the first couple of months, I felt very depressed, but this eventually cleared.

What they do is make it easier for your decision-making part to say 'hey, let's do this' or 'we gotta do something productive now.' So instead of staring at my phone for 3 hours before finally ripping myself away and doing my homework, it's 1 or 2 hours. Side bonus, the meds make me sleepy, so I take them before bed to help me sleep. They're a 24-hour non-stimulant med, so it doesn't matter when you take them as long as you're consistent."""

Unlike Adderall and Strattera, this feels like something I can take every day for the rest of my life, God willing. I am lucky and grateful that my state insurance covers this medicine 100%. I find it easier to talk to people on the phone, at least. My anxiety is still really bad in person. I don't feel too far from the good qualities of my unmedicated self when I take this. Insomnia is worse, and this has decreased the effectiveness of sleep aids of all kinds. I have more of a problem waking up in the morning so far.

I’ve been on a variety of meds for depression and anxiety over the years, so it really stood out. More recently, a move caused a change of insurance, and of course, they decided they needed a pre-authorization during the gap between my previous psych person and my new PCP.

We were so excited to try Qelbree. But by day three, we had to stop, as it made him physically and verbally violent. We almost called 911 at one point... and he is only 9 years old. Some of this likely has to do with him going off Cymbalta in order to take Qelbree because they contraindicate. We'd hoped that since Qelbree is an SNRI, it might help his anxiety, but we didn't expect Qelbree to make things (so much) worse.

Long story short, I went cold turkey off of 100 mg and again experienced a terrible headache for about 36 hours and withdrawal symptoms from morning until evening. I couldn't keep water or food down, I was vomiting or dry heaving every 2-3 hours. After hurling, I had hot flashes and sweats.

About 2 months after that, I started hearing voices, seeing things, having sleep paralysis, delusions, and a lot of symptoms of psychosis. This was the second manic episode I've had that was this bad. It was like I was on crack or something, like I had never-ending energy. I'm going back on the medication again, but only 300 mg.

My psychiatrist recommended I try Qelbree and I was on it for almost 2 months. During that time, I pooped 3 times. Yes, 3 times in 5 weeks. While Qelbree did help my ADHD symptoms, the bathroom component was too large of a side effect to ignore. I was disappointed to stop taking it though.

However, he was happier than usual, slept better, and gained weight (which was a +). He increased to 200 mg just before the start of school, and within days, high anxiety, fear of school, failure, and schoolwork, cried nightly and each morning. He is academically gifted, and school is exciting and fun, never scary. This was very concerning. After 2 weeks, we are certain it is manic episodes brought on by Qelbree. Do not take if your child is sensitive in nature and prone to lows.

But I couldn’t wait for it to kick in. I couldn’t function after it stopped working. The morning and evening struggle was REAL. My doctor switched me to Qelbree - they just got approved for adults. I’m on 400mg and honestly - WHAT A GAME CHANGER. I can go to sleep at night without racing thoughts, get up and get the clan ready without losing my keys, I have much more patience with my students, and have the ability to focus on which sports event and where I need to be and when in the evening.

He can't sit still - he gets bored - he paces the floor so much I can't believe there aren't holes. He is now a few weeks in at 400mg, AND WHAT A DIFFERENCE! He isn't blurting out off-color jokes or offending people. We don't have to say, 'Sorry, it's just him,' to people, and his confidence has gone WAY UP. He always says he knows some things he says are offensive, but he gets so excited he can't stop the words. He's able to function better in groups and can actually sit or relax.

qelbree,For ADHD,"For ADHD""This is a good, thorough review! So I have bipolar disorder I, and no doctor would entertain my claim of ADHD, they also said I'm fine because I'm in law school. But my first year was horrible. My doctor told me she would let me try Qelbree if I agreed to give up my as-needed Klonopin. I said yes. First day, I took it at bedtime. Slept great, slight headache the next day. Second day, I sat down and studied for five hours straight. I was so happy. I was slightly worried it would trigger mania. However, I can function manic fine and safe. I did completely lose my appetite, though, only being hungry once a day or eating edibles. Often, I didn't eat for full days. I got super constipated and had to meal prep. But my confidence skyrocketed. I clean, study, and work more efficiently. My doctor messed up my refills, and I had to go ten days without it. That was rough, I was eating a lot and moody. I just restarted, focus is back, but it feels like crack!"""

Since being on Qelbree, my son has turned from failing grades into A's and B's. He wants to do well in school. He has come out of his shell and has started to enjoy being around people and even joined a sport. I'm so thankful for Qelbree.

Two days later, I was at work and feeling dizzy and awful. I left work early. I went to the ER and got more IV fluids. Again, they thought I was dehydrated and having GI issues. I saw the GI specialist who ordered some tests in two months. The third week, I started 600 mg then completely stopped it a day or two later because I felt awful. The day after I stopped it, I felt incredibly nauseous and left work early. I went to the ER. I was shaky, confused, and paranoid. I thought I was having a stroke. Head CT was normal. The doctor said I was having a bad reaction to Qelbree. I got IV fluids and Ativan. I was sent home. During the night, I started vomiting uncontrollably. I went to the ER again. This drug almost killed me. Don’t recommend!!"""
qelbree,For ADHD,"For ADHD""My son has comorbid anxiety and ADHD. When we finally saw, after a year+ (granted, a Covid year, with all the variables and extra stressors), that first Concerta and then Vyvanse were very helpful at school but increased my son's anxiety and agitation to the point of physical aggression and verbal abuse, we took him off stimulants. We were so excited to try Qelbree. But by day three, we had to stop, as it made him physically and verbally violent. We almost called 911 at one point... and he is only 9 years old. Some of this likely has to do with him going off Cymbalta in order to take Qelbree because they contraindicate. We'd hoped that since Qelbree is an SNRI, it might help his anxiety, but we didn't expect Qelbree to make things (so much) worse. We got no advice from our psychiatrist re: if it would subside, so we decided to quit; everyone in our home (two parents and two siblings) was traumatized. Qelbree may not be a good fit for comorbid anxiety and ADHD... sadly, nothing is."""

He has been sent home from school, having bad outbursts and being very moody. He has been making bad threats to students and teachers. I've been in tears, can you imagine having to take your 8-year-old to get evaluated for mental health when he doesn’t even realize what’s happening to him? I’ve had to keep him home because it’s that bad. He cries for no reason, very sensitive. I want my little boy back. I wish I would’ve read these reviews before I started him on this medication.

qelbree,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I'm a 54-year-old female who has battled ADD most of my life. Given the fact that I was always very bright in school, I didn't come across as distracted. I could attend to a dozen things at once and still get my work done, although projects were always done at the last minute. If I didn't have a list/calendar, I was totally lost. When I had children, I realized that I needed help but never sought out meds: I just muddled through. I finally decided to talk to the doctor about it. The 2nd day on 200 mg Qelbree, I got up that morning and did housework for 6 hours straight, without losing focus and starting/stopping like I usually do. The 3rd day, I realized I was a lot less squirmy in church and felt very calm inside. So far, the only real side effect I've noticed is difficulty sleeping. I wake every hour or two, wide awake for 30 minutes to an hour. I have been taking the medicine in the morning but plan to start taking it in the evenings to see if that helps."""
qelbree,For ADHD,"For ADHD""I took 100 mg tablets as a starting dose for inattentive type ADHD. I had some issues with sleepiness in the daytime, so I switched the dosing time around a bit. I think I noticed my mood lift a tiny bit, but not a ton. When I forgot to take it for a few days, I experienced a brutal, world-ending migraine. I immediately took another pill when I got home from work, which stopped it. Towards the end of the month, I ordered more and then my insurance wouldn't cover it unless it was a higher dose. Long story short, I went cold turkey off of 100 mg and again experienced a terrible headache for about 36 hours and withdrawal symptoms from morning until evening. I couldn't keep water or food down, I was vomiting or dry heaving every 2-3 hours. After hurling, I had hot flashes and sweats. It was frankly kind of terrifying how awful going off of just 100 mg was for me. I didn't notice enough improvement to consider ever going back on this medication again if the risk of withdrawal is this bad."""

Within 2 weeks, he was having fits of rage at school, saying shockingly insensitive and rude things. He is normally the sweetest little boy. Now he only feels rage. He told me he doesn't feel love for anyone anymore. He repeatedly threatened suicide at school today. I stopped the Qelbree 5 days ago, and it's not getting better yet. I am beyond terrified.

I suffer also from chronic migraines, OCD, panic/anxiety, and psychotic episodes. I’m managing them without any narcotics or controlled subs. I wanted something I could stop as needed without physically debilitating symptoms. Nausea, nightmares, insomnia, anger, dilated pupils. My pharmacy didn’t have this med on time. Once I missed a dose and felt icky all day. After that I got ill and projectile vomited for a whole night. Took med next day and was okay. The second time I missed two because it wasn’t filled.

Constipation stuck around, but it does with every medication for me. It really helps with motivation, the ability to start and stay on task, and my brain is quiet enough to not be totally overwhelmed all the time. I am me again. One negative is it does not help with concentration that much. I mean, I do not hyper-focus like on stims. I do miss that part."""

Now I take Jornay PM 100 mg in the evenings and Qelbree whenever I feel like it once daily. As a father of small children with a demanding legal profession schedule and difficulty finding work/personal balance and meeting obligations, I have found Qelbree helpful to tackle avoidance issues. Life & work are fun again. Landed in the ER twice with weird & acute sensations in my thighs/groin area when I went up to 400, which was ultimately attributed to constipation. Taking Miralax and Benefiber. Still, monitor side effects closely with the doctor and just push through if possible.
