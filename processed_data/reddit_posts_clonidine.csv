clonidine,"Clonidine has changed my son's life From a thread a couple years ago for anyone curious:

Clonidine can be used off label as a treatment for ADHD. It isn’t commonly prescribed, because guanfacine (Intuniv) is in the same drug class and approved for ADHD treatment.

Clonidine is shorter acting than Intuniv. When it is prescribed, it is usually prescribed to be taken at night. It lowers blood pressure and provides a somewhat sedative effect. Some people have difficulty winding down after using stimulants during the day to function. Clonidine in the evening can help this transition. 

Intuniv on the other hand is longer acting. It is useful for those who have impulsivity and hyperactivity as part of their ADHD symptoms. Taken at bedtime, it is designed to alleviate these issues in the same way clonidine does… and can provide relief from irritability, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. It is designed to last 24 hours but for some this can cause sedation during the daytime even when paired with stimulants. 


----

My own experience is Clonidine at night helped a lot with sleep. I am very prone to side effects and I only have a little dry mouth. Plus the anxiety benefits from blood pressure I could feel literally the first time I took the medication. For ADHD, the benefits are not suppose to materialize for about 4-6(?) weeks. 


I haven't had a medication work this well maybe ever.","clonidine has changed my sons life from a thread a couple years ago for anyone curious

clonidine,"Clonidine has changed my son's life My psychiatrist added clonidine to my medications about a year ago to help me primarily because I was having trouble sleeping and it happened to be helpful but I also just ""felt better"" I do not really know how else to explain it. 

Mainly in my ability to handle my emotions in situations that normally would stress me out and result in anger and frustration. Not free from anger and frustration by any means but my ability to remain composed and clear headed in those situations grew as well as many of the other issues I have with emotional regulation.

That has fostered a new level of confidence in myself that has led me to excel in my new job and let go of some of the bad I carried with me as well as becoming a better listener, being more optimistic and mindful every single day.

clonidine,"Clonidine has changed my son's life Clonidine was life changing for me, as well. I started taking it for tics and it ended up doing so much more. The biggest change, for me, was with my OCD. I had extremely distressing intrusive thoughts - basically my brain just spamming horrible gore imagery at me 24/7. I couldn't function. A few months after starting clonidine, I realized suddenly that my intrusive thoughts had faded away. I couldn't remember the last time I'd had one. They were so nonexistent that I hadn't even noticed they were gone. I cried a lot. Realizing I was free from my own brain was an unexplainable feeling. It's been a few years since then and I do, occasionally, get flares where the intrusive thoughts come back, but I'm able to quiet them pretty easily.

It's also done wonders for my ADHD and pretty much eliminated my depression and most of my anxiety. I was completely nonfunctional prior to starting it. In bed all day every day, smoking weed whenever I was awake because being high felt better than the brain fog and anxiety, and I couldn't think while sober anyway. My therapist was wonderful but had realized that she couldn't do anything to help me get better, she was just a lifeline at that point. All of that changed. I was able to actually benefit from therapy, I stopped needing to be high, I had actual energy, and I could think for the first time in years.","clonidine has changed my sons life clonidine was life changing for me as well i started taking it for tics and it ended up doing so much more the biggest change for me was with my ocd i had extremely distressing intrusive thoughts   basically my brain just spamming horrible gore imagery at me  i couldnt function a few months after starting clonidine i realized suddenly that my intrusive thoughts had faded away i couldnt remember the last time id had one they were so nonexistent that i hadnt even noticed they were gone i cried a lot realizing i was free from my own brain was an unexplainable feeling its been a few years since then and i do occasionally get flares where the intrusive thoughts come back but im able to quiet them pretty easily

clonidine,"Clonidine has changed my son's life My psych has put me on clonidine but I feel like I am moving through sludge. He used it to help me with anxiety. I do not feel relief from anything. I suppose I am sleeping well, but I didn't have a problem sleeping before. I was on citalopram for depression, anxiety, and panic attacks after my sister passed away suddenly in 2011. It worked well until the last two years. In 2022 I was dxd with ADHD and went on Adderall which seemed to help..then I got a more stressful job and needed more Adderall. So I went up and got extended release. Anxiety got worse, depression got worse, marriage got worse. One therapist said I was bipolar. I'm not. One psych then put me on extended release Xanax daily. That did seem to help the daily feeling of butterflies in my chest but nothing else. 

New psych weaned me totally off citalopram, I stopped the Adderall too. Then he started me on fluoxetine and buproprione. I had daily afternoon attacks of rage and anxiety and I was just angry all the time and still crying all the time. I went to the ER with shortness of breath and chest pains. Doc put me on clonidine. Nothing wrong with my heart he said. Just med chnages. 

Psych and i decided to try paxil. I hated that bc mood was better but anxiety was still there. Then I had a week long migraine. So psych decided to wait until migraine was over (neurologist treated with steroids) and now I'm just hanging here on clonidine with a husband who is angry with me for being erratic and moody. 

Oh, and I'm 48, menopausal and I live with 3 teenagers and an ADHD 11 year-old.","clonidine has changed my sons life my psych has put me on clonidine but i feel like i am moving through sludge he used it to help me with anxiety i do not feel relief from anything i suppose i am sleeping well but i didnt have a problem sleeping before i was on citalopram for depression anxiety and panic attacks after my sister passed away suddenly in  it worked well until the last two years in  i was dxd with adhd and went on adderall which seemed to helpthen i got a more stressful job and needed more adderall so i went up and got extended release anxiety got worse depression got worse marriage got worse one therapist said i was bipolar im not one psych then put me on extended release xanax daily that did seem to help the daily feeling of butterflies in my chest but nothing else

clonidine,"Clonidine has changed my son's life I’m not very familiar with guanfacine as compared to risperidone, but I work in DD/psych and long term risperidone seems to have more extrapyramidal side effects like dyskinesia.

clonidine,"Clonidine has changed my son's life Popping in to say that my doc recommended Clonidine for me because I’m right on the cusp of menopause (the awkward several years before, where you get all the fun symptoms of menopause but also still have to deal with irregular periods), which added terrible night sweating to my already prevalent anxiety-induced-insomnia that I’ve had all my life.

It works amazingly well!  I got the first goodnight’s sleep I’d had in so long that I didn’t remember — and since she wrote the script for me to take one at night and one during the day “as needed”, I searched to see how that would interact with my ADHD meds.  What stunned me is how many reviews I found that praised it as being so helpful when taken in addition to ADHD meds.  

If I take one during the day, it’s usually when I’m overwhelmed / overstimulated past what my ADHD meds can handle.  I can be in a full-blown panic attack, and if I take a clonidine, it chills me out within 20 minutes without any kind of weird drugged feeling like you would get with lorazepam or something like that.  I just suddenly feel like I can breathe again, and there’s a slightly sleepy feeling that’s not too hard to fight off if you need to continue working, but if you wanted to lay down you could.

clonidine,"Clonidine kinda slaps Clonidine can be used off label as a treatment for ADHD. It isn’t commonly prescribed, because guanfacine (Intuniv) is in the same drug class and approved for ADHD treatment.

Clonidine is shorter acting than Intuniv. When it is prescribed, it is usually prescribed to be taken at night. It lowers blood pressure and provides a somewhat sedative effect. Some people have difficulty winding down after using stimulants during the day to function. Clonidine in the evening can help this transition. 

Intuniv on the other hand is longer acting. It is useful for those who have impulsivity and hyperactivity as part of their ADHD symptoms. Taken at bedtime, it is designed to alleviate these issues in the same way clonidine does… and can provide relief from irritability, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. It is designed to last 24 hours but for some this can cause sedation during the daytime even when paired with stimulants. 

Clonidine can give some very bizarre dreams so for anyone who has PTSD, this class of medication might not be a good choice.

clonidine,"Clonidine kinda slaps The first night I took Clonidine .1mg, I woke up with my hand clutching my neck pretty firmly because I was dreaming that I got gum stuck in my throat and I just kept pulling and pulling it out but the gum was stuck in my throat.

clonidine,"Clonidine kinda slaps Absolutely.  It’s been great.  We find the clonidine crushed fine into a little milk with a couple of drops of melatonin (equalling about 0.2mg melatonin) about 40 mins before bed has bed time so much easier.  

The first week she really noticed her eyes getting heavy before she was ready to wind down. Which she complained a little about. But looking back after several months of it - she wasn’t ready to wind down because every day and night was a struggle for her. So adrenaline was on and winding down was hard!

With constant use bed times are now - dare I say it - kind of pleasant now!  A bit of wrangling to get her teeth etc done to actually get into bed. But then I read to her, we chat a bit then lights out and after 10 minutes she’s usually out.   The whole process can still take 40-60 minutes. But it’s more relaxed now.

clonidine,"Clonidine kinda slaps Ha yeah. Had that happen so many times!  

First thing to check is the melatonin dose. Most are way overdosed and can cause a paradoxical reaction like that where they wake in the night. 

Secondly, this happened to us a lot when she was chronically overtired.  We had an excellent sleep therapist when she was really small and she showed us graphs of “awake” hormones like adrenaline and serotonin and where they naturally peak and wane in the day-night cycle and the relation to sleep. 

When they are overtired (which is most of the time for adhd kids and others!) the awake hormones kick into a higher gear because the signal from the body is that they are in danger!  Like in cave times ;).  So the signal is “be prepared”.   Which of course keeps them awake! Making it worse over time. 

Then we are at them saying “you need to go to sleep!!”  

Then when they finally pass out from exhaustion the hormones don’t get flushed out immediately.   So they are light sleeping until the body says “ok that’s just enough for me to be prepared for the danger again” and they wake up….at 4am!
 The cycle goes around and around. 

So the trick is stick with the clonidine etc and consistently get them in bed *before* they get tired. Nice and early.  Before the hormones ramp up even further. 

Over time it becomes less of a fight.","clonidine kinda slaps ha yeah had that happen so many times

clonidine,"Anyone with positive experience with Clonidine for ADHD ? I take vortioxetine 15mg, Clonidine 350mcg and coincidentally started today on Atomoxetine 40mg. I’m either feeling a powerful placebo or day 1 effects from Atomoxetine which I did not expect. I was able to do double the workout I would usually do and my mood was euphoric all day. I am hoping it is not a hypomanic response (I am susceptible to SSRI-induced hypomania, but I have complex diagnoses being ASD, ADHD and Borderline Personality Disorder).

The theory of my psychiatrist is that vortioxetine has cognitive enhancing effects due to 5-HT3, and perhaps 5-HT7 antagonism, and clonidine too with its alpha-2a agonism. Atomoxetine might be the final straw to increase dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex and provide the kick needed to lift off for ADHD without anxiety.

I found that Clonidine so far has not helped my ADHD to a significant extent, though perhaps it has effects on some impulsivity and memory enhancement.

I had great success with Guanfacine XR 6mg in the past on ADHD, though it had intolerable side effects (incredibly light sleep, middle insomnia, misophonia at night, severe social inhibition, lack of sense of emotional expression, humour and wits, severe irritability).

It however gave me incredible impulsive control and ability to plan and organise (healthiest diet ever, would plan out 15 minutes in sunshine everyday, almost OCD levels of  behaviour like hand washing, brushing teeth, doing the dishes), anticipation of future reward from such tasks, impressive working and long term memory enhancement and recall (such as automatically remembering dates and finding mnemonic studying extremely easy), huge work ethic (I’m talking 16 hour assignment and study days).

The success of Intuniv at such a high dose gives me hope that there is effective ADHD treatment possible for me, and I wish I had tried it with an antidepressant. However, I will provide an update after 1-2 months of Atomoxetine use in combination with clonidine (and vortioxetine) and see where this combination takes me.","anyone with positive experience with clonidine for adhd  i take vortioxetine mg clonidine mcg and coincidentally started today on atomoxetine mg im either feeling a powerful placebo or day  effects from atomoxetine which i did not expect i was able to do double the workout i would usually do and my mood was euphoric all day i am hoping it is not a hypomanic response i am susceptible to ssri induced hypomania but i have complex diagnoses being asd adhd and borderline personality disorder

clonidine,"Anyone with positive experience with Clonidine for ADHD ? I'm on week 2, just went up to 0.2mg (0.1 twice daily). Yes reduction of highs and energy bursts, but I'm considering the possibility that this is a good thing! My stimulant (a formulation of Focalin) kinda forced my emotions and I would feel kinda drained after. Adding on Kapvay has kinda leveled everything out, and I'm hoping that as I adjust I'll learn to focus on my emotions with them being more subtle. Also the physical overstimulation issues I had are disappearing, and my brain has been more quiet than ever 😃

For context the way I process norepinephrine is a little weird. I think I have a genetic mutation that causes norepinephrine to accumulate (COMT Met/Met) and that also pushes my cardiovascular system a bit too much. I tried Intuniv (guanfacine) for a month first and immediately felt benefits due to the ""blood pressure"" (norepinephrine-reducing) effects - the same effects that most people hate! However, you build tolerance to those effects, and when that happened I actually felt stoned for about a week before I started titrating off.

I think you have to wait a few weeks for your body and brain to adjust before you make a final decision. I'm wondering if Kapvay will kinda create a roof for stimulation: it first mellows everything out, then your body returns to baseline but doesn't cross the line that Kapvay sets.

clonidine,"Anyone with positive experience with Clonidine for ADHD ? I got it for sleep after the psychiatrist  who specializes in sleep ran out of antidepressants and sleep meds for me to try. It’s been a hell of a few months, 8 rx later the doc had an epiphany that I was add (I’m adhd, whatever). I told her this on my first visit and she told me there was no way I could be so professionally and academically accomplished, be 55 and adhd. Whatever. She gave me clonodine after I refused an other antidepressants last week. I was afraid to take it with 7 am meetings the next day (other solutions turned me into a zombie or just didn’t work). I took it with 4 mg of melatonin and for the first time I ever remember understood the concept of drifting off to sleep. Day 1. I’m on day 4 and optimistic though I’ll say there have been a lot of tears wondering why no one caught this earlier. It takes much longer to work (like 2 hrs vs 30 min according to the doc) than described but it works. I lived for 15 yrs taking ambien because it was the only predictable way I could sleep. 

I’ve been to so many specialists and no one would listen to the adhd idea until a nurse and I talked about it. 

I’m now trying to disentangle what’s adhd, decades of disordered sleep and just me. Yes you get depressed from lack of sleep. Have insomnia long enough and you’ll definitely end up anxious because it’s hard to function never knowing how much sleep you’ll get.","anyone with positive experience with clonidine for adhd  i got it for sleep after the psychiatrist  who specializes in sleep ran out of antidepressants and sleep meds for me to try its been a hell of a few months  rx later the doc had an epiphany that i was add im adhd whatever i told her this on my first visit and she told me there was no way i could be so professionally and academically accomplished be  and adhd whatever she gave me clonodine after i refused an other antidepressants last week i was afraid to take it with  am meetings the next day other solutions turned me into a zombie or just didnt work i took it with  mg of melatonin and for the first time i ever remember understood the concept of drifting off to sleep day  im on day  and optimistic though ill say there have been a lot of tears wondering why no one caught this earlier it takes much longer to work like  hrs vs  min according to the doc than described but it works i lived for  yrs taking ambien because it was the only predictable way i could sleep

Please don't mimic my dose schedule. Clonidine is quite potent, especially when first starting. It needs to be titrated up and also down (if needing to reduce).

If you come off it without titration you risk really high blood pressure and you'll feel terrible.

clonidine,"To Clonidine or not to Clonidine No experience with clonidine. But I know it is officially indicated as second-line/adjunct treatment for ADHD in many places. Sedation is a (side) effect for all three drugs: clonidine, trazodone and lorazepam. Especially trazodone. So it makes sense to try to cut down the number of different medications taken which will make you feel drowsy. 

Also these medications can interact (check CYP2D6), so things like serotonin syndrome might be a real concern and possibility, depending on dosages.

I say go with your doc's recommendations.

clonidine,"Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed” People are generally misguided about ADHD, but i think the doc has a few points. Compared to something like Down's syndrome which has a very clear cause and definition, ADHD is pretty vague, right? Like this one part of the brain is supposedly smaller but even that can't be used in a diagnostic sense? It really is a collection of symptoms, and which things we consider symptoms or not, whether we tell someone to live with something or consider adjustments with meds or therapy, it is all a completely man made construct.

And while for 10 years ritalin made me awake, it makes me sleepy now. Stuff is very undefined and prone to change like that.

So while the doc may be wrong in having an extremist opinion and looking at the world through this single, narrow frame of reference, he is also a specialist of some kind, and i think it helps to remember that in some cases he'll be right. For example, everyone who is struggling with something, will as a consequence of getting a diagnosis, be able to forgive themselves for some of their failings. It is absolutely a thing that after getting a diagnosis people will drop their demands on themselves too much, find too much comfort in forgiving themselves, and start blaming unrelated issues on their diagnosis.

You don't need to take such advice enough to drop the meds and copes you have learned work for you, but it is always a good thing to stay critical of them and keep testing yourself.

It's like all these depressed people being sick and tired of hearing they need to go for walks in nature, but when they finally get out of depression, they will start rattling off the same thing. Walks aren't a cure for depression, and ppl are mistaken to sell it that way. But it is absolutely part of developing routine/discipline/health/etc that is necessary to break out of depression, so while it is wrong advice it should still be taken.

Our meds really are dangerous drugs, sometimes we are to blame but shift blame to our diagnosis, and it's good to remind ourselves occasionally","sleep doctor said adhd wasnt real and an excuse to take speed people are generally misguided about adhd but i think the doc has a few points compared to something like downs syndrome which has a very clear cause and definition adhd is pretty vague right like this one part of the brain is supposedly smaller but even that cant be used in a diagnostic sense it really is a collection of symptoms and which things we consider symptoms or not whether we tell someone to live with something or consider adjustments with meds or therapy it is all a completely man made construct

I do. My pulmonologist even said its not uncommon for people with ADHD to not get their Narcolepsy diagnosed until later than normal. Because their ADHD meds *are some of the exact medications used to treat Narcolepsy*. 


Both conditions are very real and absolutely impact people's lives. Both conditions can have weird interactions with eachother. Both conditions can be treated with the same medications (for wakefulness at least) but you may need to do adjustments and another nighttime med to sleep properly. You can absolutely do a sleep study while still being on ADHD medication.

clonidine,"Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed” When I had someone come at me with this, I had a definite line of defense. For one, my adderall has never once made me feel ""high, ""euphoric"", ""invincible"",  ""calm"", or keep me up all night.  What it makes me feel is normal and focused. Able to function, able to concentrate and process information. Able to finish a task from start to finish.

 Then, secondly, I had to tell two different people, one a pharmacist, one a tech,  that their job was litetally to fill what my doctor had prescribed, not to judge. Consultation is not an evaluation. They can tell me what to expect in the way of side effects, what drugs will cause interactions, how much and what strength my doctor prescribed..... but they are not doctors, and I don't come to the pharmacy for moral advice. 

I changed pharmacy's after that encounter,  and the one I have now is so awesome. 

Before I changed, the same pharmacy denied me pain needs after a rotator cuff surgery. The med my surgeon first prescribed me made me nauseated and gave me headaches, so he gave me a handwritten prescription for a different pain reliever. My son took me to the pharmacy since I was in a sling, and he was behind me in line, 6'3"" and in sunglasses because he is ADHD also and suffers light sensitivity, especially fluorescent lights. They looked from me to him, went in the back, had a conversation, and came back and said they couldn't fill it because it had only been 24 hrs since the first controlled substance. I explained I couldn't tolerate that one, and I HAD IT WITH ME and told them I would gladly hand them back to destroy or whatever, but they said no and treated us like freaking thugs and made everyone in the line watch us like we were gonna rob the joint. It was so humiliating. 

I understand controlled substances are abused. Without a doubt, it's an epidemic. But it really makes it suck for the non-addicts  just trying to function. I try hard not to judge those in the throes of addiction.

clonidine,"Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed” OK, bad example.  Here's another:  many psychiatrists will prescribe naltrexone to alcoholics.  I used to be about as bad an alcoholic as you can imagine, I was given the choice of that or another.  The main ""selling point"" (probably literally) is that it ""prevents cravings"".  The way it does this is by basically dulling the effects of alcohol, then over time you won't associate alcohol with pleasure.  Problem is, *you have to drink* to get the craving-preventing effect.  And if you're a serious alcoholic, you can't do that.  And really, you'll keep drinking anyway, because with your tolerance you barely feel anything until you're blacked out anyway.

Point being, in my experience psychiatrists have never seemed that sharp, and can have the potential to do a lot more harm than good.  They should be below psychologists on the ladder, who are in a better position to make an accurate diagnosis and actually follow the latest research.","sleep doctor said adhd wasnt real and an excuse to take speed ok bad example  heres another  many psychiatrists will prescribe naltrexone to alcoholics  i used to be about as bad an alcoholic as you can imagine i was given the choice of that or another  the main selling point probably literally is that it prevents cravings  the way it does this is by basically dulling the effects of alcohol then over time you wont associate alcohol with pleasure  problem is you have to drink to get the craving preventing effect  and if youre a serious alcoholic you cant do that  and really youll keep drinking anyway because with your tolerance you barely feel anything until youre blacked out anyway

Fast forward to now, the new antidepressants didn’t do anything for my symptoms and I finally saw another psychiatrist after both psychologists I saw said they think I have ADHD symptoms.

My partner also recently got diagnosed and he was hung up on the possibility of it not being ADHD and the costs and hurdles involved. But after he got diagnosed he felt a huge wave of relief and got quite emotional.

All this to say when you’re ready and curious, go for it. There’s nothing to lose other than the monetary part but even then I say it’s a worthy gamble to figure it all out.

clonidine,"Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed” Yeah I considered the same for a while, then I came across something that made me feel I was specifically inattentive that I decided to address point 1. Turned out I was correct. But:

1. If you find yourself relating well to anecdotes from people with ADHD, it’s very likely you have it. When I describe what it’s like for me at time to my partner, she can struggle to understand. Explain the same thing to someone who does have ADHD and I’ll get a matching anecdote from them. Once you have the diagnosis though, it’s extremely validating. 

2. It has improved mine significantly. Both at work and at home. I’m far less tired after work, more positive, and more patient. 

3. Yeah it’s not super expensive but that obviously depends on your circumstances. Most expensive single part for me was the psychiatrist, which was about $800. A bit over half was covered by Medicare. Ongoing costs are about $60 per month (Vyvanse + Clonidine) in medication. Impulse spending is down though…

4. That’s exactly where I was. Able to manage so not sure how much difference there would be. Medication isn’t magic, so you still need to manage yourself just not as hard as without. 

Feel free to DM at any point in the future if you need.","sleep doctor said adhd wasnt real and an excuse to take speed yeah i considered the same for a while then i came across something that made me feel i was specifically inattentive that i decided to address point  turned out i was correct but

clonidine,"Sleep doctor said ADHD wasn’t real and an excuse to take “speed” For me, when I went to the place after I got my referral, after a series of meetings and tests they tried to diag me with GAD. At the time I had had severe anxiety related to work and there is the kind of circular symptoms where ADHD can cause anxiety, while anxiety can cause some of the symptoms you may also see under ADHD. So I understood where they were coming from, however in the meeting, I realized what they said didn't make sense as I had had ADHD symptoms before I was having anxiety. I told them so and it was basically ignored (maybe due to them already having had the report done and out at that point). I told them that I agreed to disagree and didn't go back.

At that point, I was mainly going for closure (due to the anxiety) and less the medication, and the whole process cost me a thousand dollars (US) or so, so I didn't feel like it was worth it to go again.

So I would say, go for it, and then see if what they say makes sense. If it doesn't, then you simply disagree (ideally you remember before the end of the diag so that they can take it into account, but we know how likely that is...). You can always spout out on here if you want to get a general sense of what they said if it is something insane or not.","sleep doctor said adhd wasnt real and an excuse to take speed for me when i went to the place after i got my referral after a series of meetings and tests they tried to diag me with gad at the time i had had severe anxiety related to work and there is the kind of circular symptoms where adhd can cause anxiety while anxiety can cause some of the symptoms you may also see under adhd so i understood where they were coming from however in the meeting i realized what they said didnt make sense as i had had adhd symptoms before i was having anxiety i told them so and it was basically ignored maybe due to them already having had the report done and out at that point i told them that i agreed to disagree and didnt go back

clonidine,"Clonidine for ADHD Buy a home blood pressure monitor and check it regularly for the first few weeks you take it. 

I took clonidine for about a month and had to stop because it was causing my blood pressure to skyrocket.

clonidine,"How the fuck do you guys sleep Every person is different, so you want to find what will work for YOU. 

So there are a ton of tips here that may or may not help you. You'll want to try different things, as well as a combination of things. 


But a big thing for ADHD people is an inability to 'calm' our minds. Which can and does make sleep difficult. I've had the same problem with insomnia in the past for exactly this reason. 


So you want to do two things in general. The first is preparation. Which is where the recommendations for exercise, sleep schedules, et al come in. Make sure you *will* be tired when you go to bed. It helps!


The second is to push your mind to let go when you are actually attempting to sleep. Which is where the recommendations for podcasts, ASMR, meds, et al come in. 


If your mind is running, then it won't allow you to sleep. So a means of distraction to calm it down helps enormously. Some type of 'focus' ironically allows your mind to relax into sleep since one thing is easier to handle than many things. 


The rule for these are two fold. You want something relatively calming. NO action movies. Documentaries or the like. Audio is better than video for most. But you also want something that will keep your focus. It has to be interesting. Too boring means you won't pay attention and will tune it out. That WON'T put you to sleep! I find astronomy cool. It keeps my attention until it doesn't. ;-) 

I've got a subscription to [Curiosity](https://curiositystream.com) for exactly this reason. It''s my nightly ritual. And it works. Probably won't work for you, but that's ok.

If you are stimulated and don't feel tired at 11 you probably won't feel tired until it is way too late, we're talking 3 or 4 and for any normal job/schedule that is way too late. Waiting until you feel tired just isn't viable most of the time.

Not sure if I can recommend it as a cure, but having kids worked for me...

I'm a very light sleeper and my wife is the opposite. We've got two small children and for the first ~2 years I was awake multiple times per night with one of them and then again early in the mornings.

Eventually I was so tired I would just go straight to sleep when I got into bed. It was a pretty novel experience for me when it first started happening (I've had trouble getting to sleep my entire life), but now I've either learnt how to just go to sleep or I'm constantly exhausted enough that it's not a problem 😂

The other thing this taught me was the importance of sleep. I'm so useless without a half decent night sleep that I really have to make an effort to get into bed early enough at night to compensate for the early mornings (thankfully both the kids generally sleep through the night now).

It might sound odd, but I also think starting meds helped.  By bedtime I feel like throughout the day I've already managed to work through the kind of thoughts that used to keep me up because I'm more focused generally.

I've still got a lot of work to do to improve this part of my coping strategy, but nowadays I believe that sleep might be one of the things that has the single largest impact on my ability to function (regardless of meds).

hah. Yeah. hi! 

It’s possible to sleep regular hours with an ADHD brain, but you do have to want to. As in. You gotta keep trying hard and refining the kill strategy. And the payoff is absolutely worth it. 

The book ADHD 2.0 (Hallowell) mentions sleep for ADHD brains as INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. 

As in. Sleep is absolutely neccessary for our ADHD brains to function at our best. And it affects our mood too and energy, way more than it affects NT folks. 

Getting good sleep WILL change your life, esp if you’re like me and have been sleeping shittily my entire life and just thinking im stupid and lazy and just experiencing depression all the time. 

Yeah. So I quit caffeine (sigh it has such a terrible effect on me - like when i already had bad sleep, and then i blast myself with caffeine or meds, and then i’m even more exhausted after the caffeine crash, and then vicious cycle that never ends)

And then I force-slept. As in. I tried A LOT of the techniques that worked for people on this sub, in other threads asking for sleep help. I spent like a month going through all of them. 

I tried different sleep podcasts. I like Sleep Cove, actually. 

I tried this sleep meditation recommended by my friend who has ADHD. It’s so boring that i absolutely nodded off lol. You gotta get recommendations from ADHD folks, not just any sleep meditation. 

I listened to this “Extremely Heavy Rain Pouring” white nose. It’s an app called “White Noise” with a pink logo. Free. Love that sound haha. 

AND. I ALSO PAIRED THE ABOVE with a very HIGH CLASS sleep mask haha. It’s sort of like spongy memory foam? SO comfortable and light (doesn’t press on my face). And blocks out 100% of light!!!!!!! 

So I really feel different when wearing it, plus with the heavy rain pouring sound in my airpods. MAN. It’s such a trip. like being in a lil cave by myself. it’s pretty epic. Really amazing experience. Luxurious. I’m never getting on a plane without it from now on. Sleep anywhere, man. 

I’m 36 years old and man, what a game-changer all of this stuff is. Been living my life never thinking that i could try different things to see if I can sleep better. I tried lots of things and FAILED. But kept going! And then i finally found stuff that worked, so I can have a better life. Kinda life hacking my life. 

You’ll also notice that bad sleep begets bad sleep. So if you have bad sleep, you’re going to find it even harder to fall asleep the next day. and you might have to do a force-sleep plus give yourself early bedtime. (I sleep trained my baby and the sleep principles are the absolute same. It works. Good sleep begets good sleep and vice versa. If you have a sleep debt and are exhausted all the time, then you need to sleep MORE in order to get back to a good sleep routine.) 

The right amount of sleep for you is when you wake up naturally, without an alarm, and wake up feeling refreshed. (From the ADHD 2.0 book by Hallowell) 

Lol. What a joke. Before I started all of this sleep forcing, the last time that ever happened with my ADHD brain was probably when i was 10 years old or something.

And ALSOOO did you know that when you are sleepy you should try to sleep and not continue to fiddle with your phone :/ because the “sleepiness” and “awakeness” comes in cycles!! so if you miss the “sleepiness window” you are doomed for that night… well maybe you’ll be sleepy again 2-3 hours later 

But my dudes. THIS STUFF. Is so good. When you sleep well. It’s amazing.","how the fuck do you guys sleep hi there hi there im here

clonidine,"How the fuck do you guys sleep Routine and discipline. I know, duh, it's not something you can just start doing as someone with ADHD. But let me explain my situation and what I do.

I work daytime Monday-Friday, that alone kind of forces me to have a sleeping routine already. I also like my job and care about clocking in on time so that helps. 

I've convinced my brain to *want* to get into bed at a good time. Because I just know how bad it will suck to get up in the morning if I only sleep 5 hours. Find out how much you need to sleep in order to have an easier time waking up and stick to that. I need around 7 and a half hours personally.

I always re-set my alarm shortly before bed so I see the ""The alarm will ring in X hours and Y minutes starting now"" pop-up. It helps me to see exactly in how many hours I need to wake up. If it says less than 8 hours I feel a strong need to go to sleep. 

If you do not have anything that you need to wake up for every morning, and face no immediate consequences for sleeping in/staying up, decide a time you want to wake up every day and stick to it.

The only one that expects you to not go to bed at 3am is you, if you want to feel more energized and take care of yourself sleep schedule is a big one. Getting good sleep is self-care.

Exercise helps a ton to get tired in the evenings. 

Try to eat dinner at a reasonable time. 

Try to reduce screen time before bed. At least of things that requires your attention, personally I get sleepy from watching long YouTube videos, like podcasts, video essays and educational videos.

Read a chapter of a book you like every night to wind down your head before sleeping.

Drink tea, not coffee.","how the fuck do you guys sleep routine and discipline i know duh its not something you can just start doing as someone with adhd but let me explain my situation and what i do

1. No phone in bed. Ever. I have my charger at the other side of the room so I have to plug in my phone and can’t reach it while in bed. It also helps with waking up. 

2. Get a smart light. I use [this](https://casper.com/ca/en/accessories/glow.html), the way it will automatically dim over 45 minutes helps me fall asleep, it also has a cool wake up mode.

3. Books. Reading is great because it gives my mind something to focus on and not let me run wild, but it’s not a screen with bright pixels. I use an ereader with a backlight set to 1% so I can read even if I’m up past the smart lights 45 minutes. 

4.  A smart speaker. For those nights where I really can’t sleep, I’ll play a guided meditation or a podcast episode (normally the sweet vocal notes of Roman Mars) the smart speaker is key because it lets you play audio without looking at a screen, which absolutely hurts everything. 


The biggest part of this that works is being away from my phone, the pixels absolutely fuck your brain up in a way that makes it hard to sleep. With the book, the dimming lights, I eventually just find my eyes getting tired and I fall asleep. 

I also find sometimes I’ll get lost in my own thoughts because of what I’m reading, but because it’s so dark already I think and close my eyes, but then sleep. 

It’s also important to not beat yourself up for not sleeping, but just focus on creating good conditions for sleep and it will come.","how the fuck do you guys sleep i follow a few simple rules that help me

clonidine,"How the fuck do you guys sleep I listen to ""The No Sleep Podcast"", or any creepy podcast at all really works like a charm for me. I usually put my head on the pillow, turn it on, make sure my alarm is set for tomorrow, then I wake up refreshed in the morning.  
 Heck, I'm so conditioned now that when I went to see NoSleep Live, I only got through half of it before I was snoring happily on my friends shoulder.  
Picked up the habit back when I was putting my kids to bed when they were little. I had one on each shoulder, read them a bedtime story, then had to stay there until they were

Stretching while listening to calm music (especially sciatic/back stretches) then when I’m in bed all the lights go off, I turn on sleep sounds with a 30 minute timer (I use BetterSleep, it’s got a good variety of free sounds and they adjust volumes throughout the playtime so it doesn’t get monotonous), curl up to my left side and boom, snoozetown. 

Some things that have made it easier are making sure to stop eating about 2-3 hours to digest eaten food before you sleep, drink water leading up to night night time, and reading before you go to bed vs staring at a screen.

clonidine,"How the fuck do you guys sleep I HAVE to run myself ragged at the gym. I’ve been working out consistently for a year and it seems to help.  Also all that research into eating right and stuff.  Low carbs mean low energy.  Also not eating past 7pm so I don’t have energy into the evening with a light meal (mainly protein dense) I’m also unmedicated and trying to raw dog life with moderate/ sometimes severe ADHD.

I used to smoke weed but that was a crutch I wanted to stop using, and sometimes it did the opposite of make me tired, so now I’m just leaning in to be a gym rat.  Basically if I don’t use all my energy, I will feel awful.  

I also think the food relationship is important too.  If you eat a lot of carbs, you will have excess energy.  Maybe try a diet that focuses on protein, that type of energy is slow burning and won’t help aid the anxiety driven ADHD moments like sugar and bread might.  These are just personal experiences that I’ve noticed with diet change.

Also, what some people have said about music or podcasts is good.  I usually just like an easy-going cartoon like bobs burgers.  Usually gets me to stop thinking.

Step 1: high vis/volume alarm on my phone to end screentime.

Step 2: medication. I was prescribed Trazodone (a very well documented SSRI) a while back and boy howdy is it a game changer. As always, talk to your doctor about meds!

[Edited to remove information regarding OTC supplements. Feel free to DM with questions!]

Step 3: calm/low engagement activity for like 30 minutes while step 2 activates. Chill podcast + crochet works really well for me personally, but any simple, repetitive task that doesn't require much if any decision making should be fine.

Step 4: heavy weighted blanket + some nice ambient music. Lately that's been Ludovico Einaudi's Seven Days Walking album(s). Beautiful low-drama piano.

I don't always manage to follow all of these, but when I do I have VERY noticeable improvement in my sleep quality. My baseline is 5-7 hours of shallow sleep (waking up and drifting off multiple times) after ~2 hours of ruminating (read: lying awake trying to get my brain to shut up).

clonidine,"How the fuck do you guys sleep I tend to watch YouTube in bed but find it keeps me up more often than not. What I've been doing the past few years is turning on an audio book that I've already listened to with a sleep timer. I still watch YouTube but at about 2am, sometimes sooner, I'll turn the book on.

The audio book I listen to is Ready Player One (read by Will Wheaton.) I've listened to at least a dozen (or three) times by now. It's currently my favorite. Occasionally, I'll put on Ready Player Two but find I get more distracted by the story as I've not listened to it as much.

clonidine,"How the fuck do you guys sleep Hi! Had adhd all my life, and I work first shift (5am) almost every day and I normally go to bed around 8pm to try to get enough sleep. 

For proper bedtime, my best advice is thinking during the day “I’ve only got x hours until 7”(hour of wind down time). If I think it whenever I see a clock, it helps me remember to finish whatever I’m distracted with and get ready for bed. 

Most important is a proper routine for bed. I’m an avid tea drinker, and my favorites for bed time are Bedtime by Yogi and comforting chamomile also by yogi (yes I combine them). 

I also use blackout curtains, as I can’t sleep unless by body can be aligned with its circadian rhythm. If it’s completely dark (no small lights from electronics, black electrical tape is great!), then my mind is much more accepting of sleep. 

As for the “two stimuli at once” my mind often desires, I try (unfortunately not that successfully) to limit screens and opt for white noise scenes from my bedroom echo or a bedtime story from YouTube. 

White noise helps me a lot, so the sleep sound by sleep jar (Alexa skill) is perfect. I also have a fan, dehumidifier (my room is a little too humid) and air purifier all provide lovely white noise!

Oh, that's *easy*

> I can never go to sleep on time

Oh. I think I misunderstood your request. As you were...

(only half joking)

The somewhat more serious answer is a combination of all the normal sleep hygiene recommendations (if you haven't already heard that advice 1001 times, then just google ""sleep hygiene"") plus *tHis OnE wiErD TRICK THaT SoMnolOGIsTs HAte*: Get up on time *every day* (even days off, sorry)

For this to work well, you should get physically active and in good strong daylight as soon after you get up as you can. A walk to the corner shop to get a snack is a good start on that front, or just doing some mindless house work with all the lights on and curtains open if that feels like a bit much for first thing. Also eat good hearty breakfast. These things give your body and brain a good strong signal that it really is time to get up, rather than time for another lovely nap / lie-in.

I also recommend taking your pills as soon as the alarm goes off to take advantage of the ""side effect"" of stimulants waking you up :-P

You'll probably find that the first couple of days are really hard work because you got to bed *far* too late to get enough sleep by the time your alarm goes off, but this really is the most powerful single thing to reset your body clock, and that really is the only way to persuade it it's bedtime when the clock says so...

This is one reason why being unemployed is such a shitty situation for me (and I suspect for ADHDers in general) I *need* the routine of a job to keep my body clock in bounds. Even a long weekend leaves me heading rapidly toward a freewheeling ad-hoc polyphasic shambles of a sleep ""pattern"" :-/ I've some times wondered if I actually have a bona fide sleep disorder, but once I'm in a good routine (a few weeks of regular waking times) I actually get to the point of waking up *spontaneously* at about the right time(!) so I suspect not.","how the fuck do you guys sleep  how the fuck do you guys sleep

clonidine,"How the fuck do you guys sleep If you take meds, i wouldn't take them after 11am. This really messed me up with sleeping. I used to wake up really early and have a good schedule, but recently i messed it up. So if i sleep past 10:30 i won't take meds unless i absolutely have to. This usually resets my sleep schedule to a decent one. I also don't have set schedules for the day,  though, so it's easier for me to do this.

Like others, i listen to stories that I'm not overly intetested in. I'll put it pretty low volume so i can barely make it out and i pass out pretty quick. 

Half the battle is getting into bed. When i first started fixing my sleep, i FORCED myself to BE IN BED by my set sleep time. At the time it was between 9:30pm and 10:15pm. I started getting ready to sleep at 9:30, and ended up in bed by 10:15. If i laid there for longer than 1.5 hours I'd get up, have some water, walk around a little, then lay back down and listen to something again. I wouldn't let myself get up again after that. 

I do take sleep aids, but normally i take those 30-45 minutes before bed, and if i can't sleep I'll take a low dose melatonin before resting again. Tylenol pm or cold/flu pm also knocks me out cold. If i have to, I'll take those for 2-3 days to steady my body into getting used to sleeping (also just congestion relief pm too). Though they do have zzzquil which would probably be better.

While it may not seem dangerous at first, persistent difficulty falling asleep can have serious consequences for a person's health in the long run. If your mind is engaged in a thought, you won't be able to fall asleep.

  
One effective technique to overcome this problem is to follow a simple rule: To fall asleep, you need to drop the thought and let go of any struggles or worries you might have. If you keep pursuing the thought or continue to struggle against it, you'll likely have a sleepless night. It may sound simple, but give it a try – you might be surprised at how effective this trick can be.","how the fuck do you guys sleep hi uflamingfia ive experienced this issue before and wanted to share some advice while it may not seem dangerous at first persistent difficulty falling asleep can have serious consequences for a persons health in the long run if your mind is engaged in a thought you wont be able to fall asleep

clonidine,"How the fuck do you guys sleep Things that have helped me -

'The Sleep Book' by Dr. Guy Meadows (not the Dr. Seuss book):
A therapist recommended it to me a few years back. It's a ACT/mindfulness approach to going to sleep. I found it very helpful (and this is a reminder to me to read it again). One of the takeaways for me was to stop worrying about every little possible outside factor to sleep, and just focus on what's happening inside yourself. Meaning, don't get distracted by getting the right kind of white noise machine, or stare at the ceiling thinking things like 'If I only had this fancy white noise machine, or took this supplement I heard about'. Or worse, what I've done before - Google 'insomnia cures' at 2:15 am. 
Focus on your breathing, and chill. 

Mindfulness meditation:
I've found mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) to be helpful. Similar to the recommendation above. Search Jon Kabat Zinn in YouTube, and you'll find some good guided meditations. I don't think sleep is the goal of those mediations, but it's been helpful for me. 

The BBC Shipping Forecast:
Another good YouTube search. It's literally just a person reading out maritime weather reports, and is one of the most boring, and relaxing things I've ever heard. The voice of the reporter can be helpful in blocking out the voices in my head, but it's just so incredibly boring that my brain can't latch onto the actual content.","how the fuck do you guys sleep things that have helped me

clonidine,"How the fuck do you guys sleep I remember reading a LPT type thing (before LPTs were a thing) that said a great way to perk yourself up is to neck a strong coffee and *immediately* go for a nap.

The caffeine takes around 20 minutes to reach your brain, which means you get a ~20 minute nap and wake up before ""nap"" turns into ""sleep"" and you don't want to wake up again, plus your wake-up timing coincides with the caffeine perkiness, so you get the best of both worlds.

Dex (and other immediate release stimulants) will similarly usually take 20-30 minutes to wake you up. I and others here will take our pills when our alarm goes off, then immediately turn over and go back to sleep to wait for them to wake us up :-P

If you're having a nap *after* the ~20 minutes it takes for the pill to reach your brain, then what's happening is probably that your pill is allowing you to notice that you're chronically sleep deprived and *need* more sleep.

clonidine,"How the fuck do you guys sleep Well, to start, traditional sleep meds won’t work and may even be dangerous because we’re not naturally tired. For example, Ambien can cause you to sleepwalk (or cook …or drive) because it targets insomnia, which is situational or behavioral, and if you don’t fully fall asleep *or* wake up on it you’re at higher risk. Speaking of behavioral, things like sleep schedules and good sleep hygiene only work for so long. Ultimately what has helped are two things: non-traditional sleep medicine and an adjusted work schedule. With those I’ve been able to maintain a 1am (ish) to 9am (ish) sleep pattern - yes pattern, because I am going to sleep when I can fall asleep naturally (it helps I’m normally tired around 1-2). I will say that if I get off in any way it moves later and later, and I will be awake at 5am. That’s when meds help. BUT I will never force myself to sleep at 10pm, which is when sleep schedules and hygiene might be good for someone with just insomnia. Oddly enough, being on my phone helps me fall asleep, especially scrolling TikTok or doing a New York Times crossword which is fully against sleep hygiene practices. I also may sometimes get tired at 10, like when I’m not sleeping until 5 and have to get up at 9, which is when the adjusted work*** schedule helps because I can catch up on sleep debt. I will say, like insomniacs, napping during the day doesn’t help *at all*. 

That’s a lot of rambling but it becomes less behavioral/environmental changes (aka sleep hygiene/schedules) and more supporting when you are actually tired on average then leaning on that. I take trazodone when I’m a little off, and Xanax when I’m way off. I worked with a sleep medicine specialist first then my psychiatrist worked with me on meds. I know specialists aren’t always the most available, so my recommendation in that case is finding your pattern and looking at if an alternate work schedule is available to you. We’re just not built for the 8-5 corporate world. I get it, though, and recognize I’m incredibly privileged. Oh!! And adhd meds have actually helped too! But this was the system before adding those.","how the fuck do you guys sleep well to start traditional sleep meds wont work and may even be dangerous because were not naturally tired for example ambien can cause you to sleepwalk or cook or drive because it targets insomnia which is situational or behavioral and if you dont fully fall asleep or wake up on it youre at higher risk speaking of behavioral things like sleep schedules and good sleep hygiene only work for so long ultimately what has helped are two things non traditional sleep medicine and an adjusted work schedule with those ive been able to maintain a am ish to am ish sleep pattern   yes pattern because i am going to sleep when i can fall asleep naturally it helps im normally tired around   i will say that if i get off in any way it moves later and later and i will be awake at am thats when meds help but i will never force myself to sleep at pm which is when sleep schedules and hygiene might be good for someone with just insomnia oddly enough being on my phone helps me fall asleep especially scrolling tiktok or doing a new york times crossword which is fully against sleep hygiene practices i also may sometimes get tired at  like when im not sleeping until  and have to get up at  which is when the adjusted work schedule helps because i can catch up on sleep debt i will say like insomniacs napping during the day doesnt help at all

clonidine,"How the fuck do you guys sleep I'm 5'11"" but I'm all arms and legs (my arm span is 6'3"") so my legs might actually be longer than yours (85cm from scruttocks to ground), and I do tend to walk at a fairly stiff striding pace, so my steps are lengthened by that compared to a more ambling meander...

By my maths, your paces on that walk were [67cm](https://www.google.com/search?q=5+miles+%2F+12000+in+metres) which feels pretty dinky to me, but my claim of 6 miles in 10,000 steps gives a step length of [97cm](https://www.google.com/search?q=6+miles+%2F+10000+in+metres) which might be a little generous. Hmm.

I'm going to have to actually go out and do some measurements in the morning - perhaps the number I remembered was rounded up when I last calculated it :-/

Some actual figures to work with, then! :-D

On Monday, I walked home from the train station, 2.67km in 2,476 steps taking 32 minutes (according to Google's fitness tracker on my phone with all the caveats of relying on a phone to do the measuring...) which works out at [109cm](https://www.google.com/search?q=2.67km+%2F+2%2C476+in+metres)(!) steps. Honestly, that might be a *particularly* brisk walk, but I feel a little more comfortable about standing by that 6miles / 10,000 steps figure now :-P At that pace, 10,000 steps would be [6.7 miles](https://www.google.com/search?q=10%2C000+*+%282.67km+%2F+2%2C476%29+in+miles)(!) and would take about [2 hours 10 minutes](https://www.google.com/search?q=10%2C000+*+%2832+minutes+%2F+2%2C476%29)

For comparison, a couple of weeks ago, was walking with my 11yo daughter and did 7.27km in 9869 steps taking 1h 49m (again, according to Google) That works out at [74cm](https://www.google.com/search?q=7.27km+%2F+9869+in+metres) steps, which is probably a bit more typical for a ""normal person"" :-P At that rate, 10,000 steps would be [4.7 miles](https://www.google.com/search?q=10000*%287.27km+%2F+9869%29+in+miles) and take about [1 hour 50 minutes](https://www.google.com/search?q=10000*%28%281hour+%2B++49minutes%29+%2F+9869%29+)

The fact that my steps-per-minute figure is *less* for the faster walk ([72 steps/minute](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-e&q=2%2C476+%2F+32) vs. [91](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-e&q=2%2C476+%2F+32)) does throw the *accuracy* of these figures into a little doubt, though. GPS and a mobile phone's accelerometer aren't *100%* accurate / reliable...

Hmm, perhaps I could work out my [steps/minute figure for the longer/slower walk](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-e&q=9869+%2F+%281+hour+%2B+49+minutes%29+in+minutes%5E-1), apply that to the time of the shorter/faster walk to get to a (possibly more accurate, possibly totally nonsense) [new number of steps](https://www.google.com/search?q=%289869+%2F+%281+hour+%2B+49+minutes%29%29+*+32+minutes), then use that to calculate [the step length](https://www.google.com/search?q=2.67km+%2F+%28%289869+%2F+%281+hour+%2B+49+minutes%29%29+*+32+minutes%29+in+metres)? That gives a step length of 92cm, and a 10,000-step distance of [5.7 miles](https://www.google.com/search?q=10%2C000+*+%282.67km+%2F+%28%289869+%2F+%281+hour+%2B+49+minutes%29%29+*+32+minutes%29%29+in+miles) (again in [1 hour 50 minutes](https://www.google.com/search?q=10%2C000+*+%2832+minutes+%2F+%28%289869+%2F+%281+hour+%2B+49+minutes%29%29+*+32+minutes%29%29) because it's the same steps-per-minute figure).

You’d probably get better results by taking a sample of your average footstep length, then measuring the distance you walk without noticeably tiring as accurately as possible. For a distance 10,000 steps, a sampling of 500 steps would be more than enough.

I think what we’re really seeing is the pointlessness of “10,000 steps per day” as life advice. The variance of effect on people based on stride length is too significant to ignore.

clonidine,"How the fuck do you guys sleep I've often thought about good ways to measure activity that aren't stymied by physiological / geometric differences.

The problem with going for *time* is that walking veeeerrrrryyyyy ssssllloooowwwlllyy would count for more than running the same distance, which is a bit arsy-varsy.

The amount of co2 you breathe out would be a pretty good measure (each molecule of co2, represents a carbon atom in a carbohydrate you've burned up...) but not exactly easy to actually *measure*. You'd probably also want to take into account the size of the individual, but simply making that ""Per Kg"" would be pretty good.

A fairly interesting proxy measure would be total heart beats. You'd again want to scale it for the size of your heart, but there isn't actually all that much variation in that (less than total size, given that putting on 5 stones of fat doesn't really do much to the size of your heart) so you could probably just do that by height or maybe armpit-to-armpit distance. If each heart beat represents an ounce (or whatever) of blood, and you assume that oxygen/co2 concentrations are reasonably invariable, that represents represents N oxygen or M co2 molecules shifted around, so one heartbeat probably represents near enough the same number of (millionths of) calories used up as another (let's pretend nobody has tachycardia or panic attacks, though, that'd probably b0rk it all up...)

It also has the advantage of encouraging *aerobic* exercise, which is better for you than merely ""keeping moving"" (though don't underestimate the value of that) and also of scaling up the amount of exercise you need to meet your targets as you get fitter, so you keep getting fitterer :-P

If I ever get my hands on a co2-in-your-breath-ometer and a pulse-measurey-watch, I'll try to put together some numbers to see how the correlation looks :-D (hmm, co2 measurers [aren't *that* expensive](https://www.google.com/search?q=NDIR+CO2+sensor&tbm=shop)...)","how the fuck do you guys sleep ive often thought about good ways to measure activity that arent stymied by physiological  geometric differences

We want something that *anyone* with common materials can implement if they earnestly want to, hence a time limit. Functionally, anyone who has access to advice like “10,000 steps” has access to time-measurement technology.

clonidine,"How the fuck do you guys sleep With regard to the ""steps"" recommendation, I'm not sure I agree with you that it's all that problematic, though it's obviously a very simple measure which can be thrown off in various ways. At the end of the day, none of these things are really intended to replace a more thorough analysis of all your body's health-correlated parameters - simply provide a reminder to actually *do* any exercise and let you know when you're taking the piss with how much exercise you're not getting :-P

I think it's probably better than time, and I'm *sure* it's better than distance, at scaling appropriately with a person's size.

If you're larger (at least in leg length, but that correlates pretty well with overall height - apes like me are the oddity) each step will take you further, but probably use a similar amount of energy per kilo of body weight per step, and I reckon that's a pretty good thing to work from.

As before, though, taking those steps at a higher rate will burn more calories and exercise your aerobic capacity more.

Take an example. For the same person, walking 10,000 steps a day. Doing it in 3 hours (a gentle mosey through the countryside looking at flowers and smiling at squirrels) wouldn't earn you a single ""heart point"" and wouldn't get you out of breath at any point (unless you're a lot less fit than me, at least) whereas doing it in 1 hour would be something few people could actually achieve without specifically training for it, and would constitute a hefty dose of exercise.

The Google Fit app (which I used for my pace figures in the earlier post) has three measures and they honestly seem pretty sane to me (as a non-exerciseologist and non-healthatrician) - the app says the measures / targets come from the WHO so presumably they have some qualified don't-die-from-lack-of-exercise experts :-P

1. ""move minutes"" - the total time spent walking/running/cycling/swimming etc. (Default target 60 per day)

2. ""steps"" (Default target 10,000 per day)

3. ""heart points"" - you get a heart point for every minute of more vigorous exercise, (brisk walking/running/cycling etc. I think there's a threshold over which you get 2 heart points a minute, too) (Default target I think is 40 daily and 150 per week but I think I changed my heart points target and don't see a ""reset to default"" option to check)

If you hit all three of those, that probably matches pretty well with all the other measures we've been discussing and avoids the most egregious of corner cases.

It also has options to link with bluetooth heartrate monitors and the like, and to enter things like weight, height, body fat percentage, and even oxygen saturation figures if you want to get nerdier with it and have the requisite equipment...

I guess the slightly deeper question is what actually has a useful impact on health, and beneath *that* question is what we mean by ""health"".

Sitting or otherwise being inactive is physically bad for you, even outside of the lack of exercise, so move minutes are definitely meaningful. ""Heart points"" correlate pretty well with exercise that improves your aerobic capacity and that has wide ranging benefits throughout your body, not least giving you more headroom for times when you need to do more than your ""normal"" amount of exercise (like running away from a tiger?)

Any measure that equates to burning calories is a little more subtle. Like the aerobic stuff, just increasing your capacity for burning calories makes your body more healthy, even if you ignore weight concerns, but for those of us who are more likely to be *underweight* than *overweight* (and people with ADHD have two reasons to be in that category - hyperactivity and stimulant medication!) it's important to balance that out with eating enough, too!","how the fuck do you guys sleep with regard to the steps recommendation im not sure i agree with you that its all that problematic though its obviously a very simple measure which can be thrown off in various ways at the end of the day none of these things are really intended to replace a more thorough analysis of all your bodys health correlated parameters   simply provide a reminder to actually do any exercise and let you know when youre taking the piss with how much exercise youre not getting  p

Also, the point about remembering to eat properly is very important for us. I lost a lot of weight when I really got onto a committed stimulant treatment, and most of that was the near elimination of my tendency to stress eat. I also just kind of… stopped taking lunch.

I've never been more than marginally overweight (never to the point that it's worried me) and have been underweight plenty. When I'm doing less well against depression (probably about half my life :-/) I often notice that I need to use a tighter notch on my belt (from forgetting / not bothering to eat properly) before I notice the other symptoms.

Somewhat uncharacteristically, I'm actually a little overweight at the moment, while having a shitty winter\*

There are those who do all sorts of healthy things (like taking care of what they eat, and doing lots of exercise) motivated by aesthetic concerns - gotta get bikini ready! I've never been one of those, I'm not really a vain person and don't much care much whether I *look* good, but the motivation I have is the wonderful feeling of *feeling* fit and healthy. Being physically strong, being able to walk / jog / whatever without getting stitches and out of breath. All that is a much better motivator for me...

What I find does well for me is just being generally physically active - walking / cycling when I could be driving\**, having a job that involves moving moderately heavy things around, being constitutionally incapable of walking at a dawdling pace... :-P

I use the fit app more as a way to remind myself if I've had a particularly lazy week that I ought to do *something* to keep the momentum going. Having a ""score"" is quite helpful in having something to ""beat"" and that score doesn't have to be all that sophisticated providing it does correlate with healthy habits to some degree, doing ""more"" is ""better"" even if you don't have (or put much weight in) a specific target...

The other half is that, rather than thinking about *how much* I eat, I try to focus on eating the *right stuff* (as well as bullying myself into bothering to eat at all, of course) I try to avoid too much sugar (not religiously, but I'll take a savoury option over a cake 99% of the time) and weight all my food toward slow energy release (high fibre, low sugar, a good amount of protein, root veggies...) because having a reasonably stable supply of available energy makes keeping doing stuff easier (both mentally and physically)

I'm perfectly happy with how this seems to be working for me, so all this stuff about measures for people in general is a little academic for me - I just can't help being a nerd :-P

clonidine,"What do you take to go to sleep? Hey OP, sorry you are going through it. But I’ve struggled with sleepless nights for almost 10 years now and the best solution I could find was again melatonin. I know you said you tried melatonin but the thing that I found most effective is to just take 0.3 mgs around 8 pm and just go about your day. Most of the melatonin supplements that are available commercially are 3 mg and that is way too much for one person and it is just not healthy. Yes, they can make you go to sleep but they also give you the most vivid dreams and it makes it even harder to get up in the morning. 

What I found most effective is to cut off caffeine around 4 pm (especially if you’re using meds) and to take 0.3 mg of melatonin around 8 pm. (you probably can’t find that exact measurement but you can just take a little nibble off the 3 mg pill, which is what I’ve been doing for the past two years.) With this method, I usually get sleepy around 11 pm so I go to bed and fall asleep watching something I know that makes me relax (cleaning videos for me but it changes from person to person). 

In summary, if I take my melatonin about 8 pm I usually fall asleep around 12 / 12:30 am and I wake up around 8 am. Obviously, you can adjust the time according to your routine.","what do you take to go to sleep hey op sorry you are going through it but ive struggled with sleepless nights for almost  years now and the best solution i could find was again melatonin i know you said you tried melatonin but the thing that i found most effective is to just take  mgs around  pm and just go about your day most of the melatonin supplements that are available commercially are  mg and that is way too much for one person and it is just not healthy yes they can make you go to sleep but they also give you the most vivid dreams and it makes it even harder to get up in the morning

clonidine,"What do you take to go to sleep? I am the same way, and the edibles and melatonin did not work out well for me =\ But I do have a pretty solid method now:

TLDR: Magnesium plus an evening ritual/routine were key for me. The routine requires a cue, a set of tasks that can vary a bit but mostly stay the same, and a reward. I also needed regular mindfulness meditation and some exercise. 

Oh and a firm no-phone rule in bed! My partner can wind down with some scrolling in bed, so that is clearly optional, but screens just keep me awake it seems.



Full routine if you need ideas:

Almost all of my lights are on timers, so they start dimming or turning off around dinner time to cue me.  This also simulates sunset, so my brain knows it is time.

Sometimes I also have an alarm (that auto plays music), but sometimes that works and sometimes it is annoying. I try to go screenless once my lights are dim though, and typically plug my phone in to charge, so I won't keep using it.

The dimming lights prompts me to walk my dogs. Ideally I go around sunset, so my reward is watching the sunset and seeing the dogs happy both. 

Note: As I get ready to leave on a walk, I check the temp in the bedroom and open a window if the room is too warm (64-66F is ideal), so it will be cool by the time I go to bed. The dogs being excited keeps me on track.

When I get home from the walk, I do some dishes (or eat dinner if I haven't yet and then do dishes) and maybe another couple chores, all while listening to an audiobook or music going to keep me rewarded and focused. Chores stop roughly 1 hour before I want to be in bed.

As soon as I am done, I take my bedtime meds and vitamins (especially the Magnesium), and make some tea. 

Note: I keep all the stuff for this next to the sink, so it is super easy to turn and start tea and hard to forget my meds/vitamins. 

I sit in my dimly lit living room, maybe light a candle or some colorful twinkle lights, and drink my tea. I can journal, just sit and think, listen to calm music, or do yoga, but the tea gets drunk and the lights stay dim.

I have my phone screen set to go black and white about this time. 

On a brain-noise night, I am allowed to use the ""pause for 30 minutes"" option to turn color back on for a few rounds of solitaire or to join a TikTok live that I find calming. Nothing else though, and no more than 2 pauses allowed.

If I pause too many times though, I lose phone time after the walks. If I make tea time about my phone too many nights in a row then the following week-ish I either skip tea or make it a post shower, pre-meditation thing in the bedroom. 

Otherwise, once the tea is gone, I grab my PJs and head to the bathroom. 

This final piece came from a fellow ADHD friend: taking a shower or bath every night - yes even if you don't really need one. I don't know why, but this was the last piece I needed for sure.

I get the shower as hot as I can stand. This then makes me yearn for the cool bedroom, and the hot to cold seems to trigger sleepiness for me. My body naturally goes cold right before I fall asleep, so 🤷‍♂️ I now encourage that.

Note: I switch to music or silence during tea probably and definitely for my shower, because some audiobooks will keep me wired or wanting to read more. 

After the shower, I change into PJs and brush my teeth (still all in the bathroom). 

When I open the bathroom door, I give my cat treats (kept in the cupboard just outside the bathroom), so he now comes to get me if I am running late for the shower/treat time. He's very good at this job.

From there I go straight to my bedroom. I meditate, sitting up in bed, for about half an hour or until I am so sleepy I just cannot sit up any longer. Mostly I focus on my breath or body sensations. 

Note: if I am having a hard time meditating, I put on music again or a guided meditation (The Science of Enlightenment by Shinzen Young is especially potent). I also have a sleep mask with headphones built in, so I can put that on to keep my eyes closed and to listen to music/meditation guides/calm audiobooks until I fall asleep. 

When the brain noise is really bad even after 15+ minutes of meditation, I get up and take my ADHD meds, or maybe drink some coffee, but only try this if you can do caffeine naps. 

I hope that helps!","what do you take to go to sleep i am the same way and the edibles and melatonin did not work out well for me  but i do have a pretty solid method now

What I did was apply the concept, i.e, established consistent eating and exercise times (within a reasonable degree of flexibility) then tracked the results using a spreadsheet/graphs.

clonidine,"What do you take to go to sleep? I feel you. I’ve struggled with delayed sleep phase disorder for many decades.

Are you on meds or off stimulant meds?

If it’s off meds, it’s easier with some good practices and hacks.

Take 200-400mg magnesium (depending on if it makes you poop too much) and 15-30mg zinc with dinner or before bed. Don’t take B6 (this often comes formulated with mag and zinc) as this will wake you up.

Melatonin is very hit or miss for me too. I wake up with a brain fog and kind of groggy. You can also decide to look at your phone for 30 min longer and skip through the effects and screw your self. I’m not a fan. The ADHD book I read recommends Tryptophan instead of melatonin. It is a melatonin precursor. I think it may work better if your body makes and converts it instead of dosing it directly.

During sleep, wear an eye mask or use black out curtains. Make your room cool (like below 68 degrees f). Wear ear plugs or use white noise if you’re sensitive to sound. Your room must be pitch dark and cool like a cave. If you get dry mouth like me use a humidifier (50-70% humidity is good).

Ideally no electronics in bed but I have no self control. If you can’t stay away from your phone, set it to the lowest brightness and try black and white mode too. It won’t wake you up because it’s hella dim. It’ll strain your eyes. I personally get so frustrated, it makes me put my phone away and go to bed, so it works for me lol.

In the morning, make sure you get 5 minutes of sun light first thing you do upon waking up. Don’t miss it. You can go back to sleep if you want but just look at the sky first.

Also avoid alcohol or heavy greasy foods before bed. Just don’t take anything before bed except select meds and your magnesium/zinc. I’m very sensitive and most things will wake me up if I’m digesting it.

All this is if you’re not on stimulants.

Now for stimulants…I don’t really have an answer for you.

Unfortunately, if you’re on Adderall, there is nothing that will keep you asleep short of benzos or some other medication that will have side effects. They literally prescribe amphetamines for narcolepsy to keep people awake.

Hydroxizine works but it also made me hella groggy waking up. I am able to fall asleep using the supplements I mentioned and taking the stimulants early but I can’t stay asleep for more than 5 hours. There is still l-amphetamine in my system and it keeps my heart rate elevated and my sleep light. I’ve tried the vitamin C trick to prevent further amphetamine absorption but it doesn’t really work that well for me. (Actually TBD because I drink Emergen C powder and that stuff has Vitamin B in it which keeps me up).

Dexamphetamine will be a bit better on sleep and Ritalin will be even better. 

Clonidine (and to an extent guanfacine) as someone else mentioned works wonders but it disrupts REM sleep for me. I sleep longer but wake up groggy and not feeling well rested. You can also form a dependence on clonidine if you do this every night. I took it for months and it took me 3 weeks to get off of it.","what do you take to go to sleep i feel you ive struggled with delayed sleep phase disorder for many decades

Have you tried guided meditation? Because it’s actually totally ok that your mind wanders, that’s kinda part of it, your mind wanders and you accept the thoughts acknowledge them and that allows you to move on from them. That and focusing on breathing (so something else). That part takes practice because it’s hard not to judge yourself (at least it was for me at the start) “I’m breathing too slow, too fast” “oh fuck another thought, I got distracted”. So it’s practicing to get to the point of just observing it “that happened, let me move on” like without judgment (like don’t beat yourself up about it).

If your problem is your thoughts, here’s what you do.

- think of another word which is not connected to the first
- repeat for a time, say about 50 words.
- stop and rest.
- if in 5 mins you’re not asleep, try with a longer time period.

* if it is actually connected, don’t worry and overthink it, just go to the next word.  It’s not about being perfectly disconnected, it’s about a sequence of roughly jumbled words.

What this does (I call this mental shuffling) is make it impossible for your brain to gain coherence and think of anything.  The jumble of chaos also mirrors dream state.

Tried out zopiclon, zolpidem, quetiapine, doxylamine succinate, melatonin and herbal supplements.

#4 Diphenhydramine. Only take if i know i won't sleep because of over stimulation, through medication or anxiety.

clonidine,"What do you take to go to sleep? I do no caffeine after 3:30 and I'm careful with the timing of my am meds so they don't impact my sleep.

I take 3mg of melatonin (don't get weird dreams from it, but I do from other things) and magnesium. 

I put everything I need is right on the night stand: water, mouth guard, lip balm, kindle/book, phone on night mode, and earplugs.  I have hydroxyzine 25mg (I do 1/2) or Clonapine (super low dose like a 1/4 of a .5mg) at hand if I'm really worried I can't sleep. I haven't needed either very often lately. I put the light out & read my Kindle or do a crossword puzzle both in dark mode & zero brightness. (Reading something really boring can help if you're desperate.) I put in my earplugs & mouthguard. It's usually about 5 minutes and my eyes are wanting to close. I put the reading or puzzle down & I'm asleep in like 2 minutes, per my husband's report. He's always amazed! 

If I feel really enervated, I dance, stretch, exercise, or clean for a while until I feel ready to go on the bedtime process. 

I know some of these things are counter to frequently cited sleep advice but this has been working for me consistently for at 4 or 5 years.

clonidine,"What do you take to go to sleep? This randomly works for me. I go through my days activities from the moment I open my eyes to the moment when I lay down. Like the whole 12-16 hours I’m awake. I don’t go into emotions or how I felt because then I start to drift into emotional world. And my emotions are what’s keeping me up in the first place. I just go over the actions of my day like I’m watching myself in a movie. I don’t talk, just visualize. 

Example: I’ll visualize how this morning I woke up,  checked my phone time, tried to close my eyes for another five minutes, felt uncomfortable, got up from bed. I checked my emails then I got up to use the bathroom. Then, I wash my hands.  I brushed my teeth and face. After that I crawled back in bed and scrolled through my phone, checking my other apps. Got up, got a glass of water, then looked at the time….. I continue going through the tasks that I’ve done in my day and somehow my brain gets tired and forces me to go to sleep. 

It’s like I’m taking control of my brains activity by giving it a task to do rather than it scrambling off on on its own accord. 
I don’t give myself a physical task otherwise that would keep me up, and doing something like reading is too much excitement for my mind that i’d just stay up.

Poor sleep is also a risk factor, so weigh your options, but it would likely be best to find a different class of drug.

clonidine,"What do you take to go to sleep? People with ADHD are the most likely to develop an alcohol use disorder, and I imagine that extends to Xanax misuse/recreational use since they both affect GABA-A in the brain. Now, don’t even get me started on stimulant abuse. I’ve never once felt even remotely euphoric in a stimulant and I think it’s psychotic to abuse them, snort them or whatever people do with them.

Also, I too was told I could not take Xanax for sleep because I was on a stimulant, but I truly believe that Xanax is the most dangerous drug, and you can’t even take it for more than like 3 weeks every day without developing a tolerance to it that will cause withdrawals. Benzo withdrawals can last for up to a little over a year, but it wouldn’t last that long if you were taking it for a couple of weeks. There’s a lot more as to why benzos are so dangerous, but I won’t explain that here.

I take hydroxyzine 12.5mg for sleep and it seems to work best. Benadryl can also work, I’d just be worried about its long term effects on memory, but there’s no withdrawal and it works super reliably.

Essentially, here is the order in which medications would be tried for insomnia. Working in a pharmacy, as a texhnician, in my opinion, this is the safest route to go. This doesn’t include less screen time, red filter on iPhone, consistent sleep time, hygiene, different stimulant med schedule, exercising, diet, no caffeine after 1pm, environmental changes, temperature changes etc. which can greatly help.
Tea
Valerian Root
Melatonin
Benadryl
Hydroxyzine
Doxylamine Succinate (this will knock most people on their ass)
Trazodone
Doxepin
Mirtazapine
Quietiapine
Zolpidem (ambien)
Eszopiclone
Some sort of benzo, probably not Xanax, maybe temazepam but only for the short term
Maybe a less potent benzo
Xanax

also i too was told i could not take xanax for sleep because i was on a stimulant but i truly believe that xanax is the most dangerous drug and you cant even take it for more than like  weeks every day without developing a tolerance to it that will cause withdrawals benzo withdrawals can last for up to a little over a year but it wouldnt last that long if you were taking it for a couple of weeks theres a lot more as to why benzos are so dangerous but i wont explain that here

i take hydroxyzine mg for sleep and it seems to work best benadryl can also work id just be worried about its long term effects on memory but theres no withdrawal and it works super reliably

essentially here is the order in which medications would be tried for insomnia working in a pharmacy as a texhnician in my opinion this is the safest route to go this doesnt include less screen time red filter on iphone consistent sleep time hygiene different stimulant med schedule exercising diet no caffeine after pm environmental changes temperature changes etc which can greatly help
tea
valerian root
melatonin
benadryl
hydroxyzine
doxylamine succinate this will knock most people on their ass
trazodone
doxepin
mirtazapine
quietiapine
zolpidem ambien
eszopiclone
some sort of benzo probably not xanax maybe temazepam but only for the short term
maybe a less potent benzo
xanax

clonidine,"Clonidine and dexamfetamine changed my life - feeling like ADHD is completely cured. Please be aware that RSD, or rejection sensitivity dysphoria, is not a syndrome or disorder recognised by any medical authority. 

Rejection sensitivity dysphoria has not been the subject of any credible peer-reviewed scientific research, nor is it listed in the top two psychiatric diagnostic manuals, the DSM or the ICD. It has been propagated solely through blogs and the internet by William Dodson, who coined the term in the context of ADHD. Dodson's explanation of these experiences and claims about how to treat it all warrant healthy skepticism.

Here are some scientific articles on ADHD and rejection:

* [Rejection sensitivity and disruption of attention by social threat cues](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2771869/)
* [Justice and rejection sensitivity in children and adolescents with ADHD symptoms](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24878677/)
* [Rejection sensitivity and social outcomes of young adult men with ADHD](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17242422/)

Although r/ADHD's rules strictly disallow discussion of other 'popular science' (aka unproven hypotheses), we find that many, many people identify with the concept of RSD, and we have **not** removed this post. We do not want to minimise or downplay your feelings, and many people use RSD as a shorthand for this shared experience of struggling with emotions. 

However, please consider using the terms 'rejection sensitivity' and 'emotional dysregulation' instead.

clonidine,"Clonidine and dexamfetamine changed my life - feeling like ADHD is completely cured. if you’re scared about things. I’d look into the lisdexamfetamine side of things. So vyvanse along with the new generics. These meds are very hard to abuse because they don’t have what I like to call a “re-stack” affect like other stimulants out there. As your body has to actually break down the medication to form two parts. The “lis” part  (enzyme L-lysine. Harmless and normal) and dextroamphetamine (the stimulant part to combat Adhd symptoms). This process cannot be sped up, hence why the “re-stack/abuse part” could (possibly) be reduced a lot. 


I was looking into stimulants a lot. I knew I would abuse the stuff. So i decided to look into meds I wouldn’t abuse like long/all day stimulants. 


Another thing that may help is to always ask yourself why you want to take more meds. Is it just for the dopamine? Probably. If so, are you going to become more productive? Probably/Definitely fucking not. Chances are your just looking around for get more dopamine out of a certain activity like a video game or something. 


You’ll be okay friend. If it helps, keep something to keep you accountable. I had to stop doing half doses of my vyvanse cause i’d attempt to restack during the day. It might help some. I was just abusing it. Now it’s once a day only. Especially recognizing that if i wanted to reup I couldn’t half it, only one full pill. Something of which i’d feel when some exam would come up but I don’t have the meds to study for it.

clonidine,"Question about Clonidine and Guanfacine They have the potential to contribute to fatigue, but nobody’s going to be able to predict how you’ll tolerate them. I don’t know about anhedonia, but wouldn’t be surprised if you could basically say the same thing. I am not a medical professional.  
  
I take Guanfacine ER 3mg. Early on I asked my doctor if I could take it in the morning instead of before bed, because I’m awful at consistently taking meds before bed. I was told to go for it, so long as it doesn’t make me too drowsy/fatigued. It doesn’t make me too drowsy/fatigued unless I didn’t get enough sleep the night before, in which case I end up getting more of the sleep I need. Works for me.

clonidine,"Vyvanse/Clonidine Delay? Getting good sleep is VERY important when taking stimulants and can make you feel drowsy and crash if you aren’t getting enough sleep. Do you have a consistent sleep schedule? Are you also getting enough protein with your meals? That always determines how tired I’m going to feel and make it a point to make sure my breakfast and lunch are nutritious and filling. Also remembering to stay hydrated as that can also lead to fatigue.

I take vyvanse everyday and what you’re experiencing could be related to your period, but from personal experience, those lethargic days were almost always cuz I was running on low sleep or fatigued from not eating and felt exhausted. Try to keep a consistent schedule and if the symptoms continue after your period, you might wanna talk to your doctor because they may need to lower your dosage.","vyvanseclonidine delay getting good sleep is very important when taking stimulants and can make you feel drowsy and crash if you arent getting enough sleep do you have a consistent sleep schedule are you also getting enough protein with your meals that always determines how tired im going to feel and make it a point to make sure my breakfast and lunch are nutritious and filling also remembering to stay hydrated as that can also lead to fatigue

clonidine,"Vyvanse/Clonidine Delay? Thank you for all this. I definitely have been trying to get good sleep, but it really depends on how busy I am. Also protein is a big thing in my house. I normally have a protein shake with breakfast but this morning I didn’t, so that could be why as well. The Vyvanse has been killing my appetite so it’s been harder to eat the things I need to because it feels more like a chore than something enjoyable at times. It depends on the day as well though. 
I sing for my job so hydration is also super important to me, the dry mouth has also been a big seller on drinking more water lol. 
Thank you so much for all of this info. I think I should start putting my foot down more in late night plans when I have an early morning. Also sticking to a fairly strict schedule on when I take my meds/eat breakfast will be more helpful as well. I’m a teacher, so summer time is hard for me to stay consistent :)

clonidine,"How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour? I have had insomnia since i was a teenager, i'm now on a medication to help me sleep but it really didn't work well until i got into somewhat of a ritual. I have very specific ways to sleep and i *have* to follow it every night or i won't sleep.
1. Do not lay in bed unless you're going to sleep or have sex. Even if you aren't feeling well, move to the couch.
2. No TV in the bedroom. I understand that doesn't work for everybody, but my bedroom is not for that sort of entertainment.
3. Try not to be on your phone in bed. Blue light from technology can make it harder to sleep.
4. Find your perfect room temperature and textiles. I prefer my room to be on the cooler side. My sheets are bamboo to help keep me from overheating but i have a nice thick comforter to keep me cozy.
5. I have bad tinnitus so i sleep with background noise. I have a fan or my air conditioner going, as well as a sound device that plays thunderstorm sounds.
6. Blackout curtains. Literally life changing.
7. Phones these days (at least the iphone for sure) have an option for a sleep schedule with ""wind down"" time. To keep it simple, you set the time you want to go to bed and it automatically puts your phone on DND a certain amount of time before you should sleep. Mine gives me an hour warning so i can start getting ready for bed.
8. Try and sleep at the same time every night, which is easier said than done. I naturally fall asleep later on the weekends but i try to keep the timing the same, and then obviously early sleep times when i need to work the next day.
9. If you're in bed for a while and can't fall asleep, get up. Move around for a bit or try sitting somewhere else for a bit. This one can be frustrating when you're exhausted and you just want to fall asleep, but your body needs to recognize you're only in bed to do so and you won't stay there unless it's for sleeping.

You almost need to train your body to recognize it's time to sleep. I had many, many years where I could not fall asleep or i would after a few hours, and then i'd be wide awake with barely any sleep. The longest i went was maybe 4-6 hours in just over a week and i ended up in the hospital. You gotta have a wind down ritual too, so whatever skin care or prep for the next day that you can do every night.

Hope i'm not coming off preachy and that this helps!!","how do you fall asleep in bed within  hour i have had insomnia since i was a teenager im now on a medication to help me sleep but it really didnt work well until i got into somewhat of a ritual i have very specific ways to sleep and i have to follow it every night or i wont sleep

If you listen to binaural beats at 1.5 hz frequency, it can entrain your brain toward the delta range of brain waves. This is the state your brain is in during deep sleep. Give it a try.

clonidine,"How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour? I've only been medicated for a couple months with stimulants, and sleep comes so much more easily because, I think, I'm not agitated and anxious and thinking a ton of thoughts because I actually got things done. Sleep comes more easily. 

Before that, though, I had horrible trouble falling asleep. I don't like sleeping pills because of morning fog atop ADHD fog. 

My doc put me on a relatively-quite-low dose of trazodone at bedtime. It's not a narcotic, and the drug is actually an antidepressant at the standard dosages. It's very effective for me and gets me there in well under an hour. It doesn't knock me out if something comes up, just somehow quiets the mind enough to facilitate sleep! No side effects. (I remembered when my doctor prescribed it that is known people who were provided a liquid form of trazodone to help them sleep in substance-abuse detox and inpatient treatment. So it seems the effects of this stuff in this manner are well-known. 

Melatonin: never found that helps me fall asleep, but an hour or two before bed and I could swear it helped me stay asleep through the night before I started getting the sleep after stimulant meds that basically seems to be an untroubled mind that's ready to reset. My doc and other research have looked me to believe 5mg is really about where that dose should be. (Some concern you're making melatonin and if you get a connection on the outside for it, maybe you won't produce it efficiently? Anyway little worry at the 5mg level.)

Breathing for sleep: While I'm not a regular practitioner of meditation (for no good reason because it's great), I'm a big believer in focusing on the breath when overwhelmed or stressed, anxious or unsettled. I do the 4 - 7 - 8 breathing technique of my mind is racing when I turn it the light. Right there on the pillow. I don't know that I've ever gotten to a fourth repetition it's so effective. I also use it if I'm freaking out while awake to calm myself down and hopefully think more clearly. I'm sharing a link that explains it, but it seems in my mind from prior explanations that bringing your focus to counting breaths and holding breaths and breathing, feeling the air come into your nose and fill your lungs to expand your belly, then going out again, when you do it just a few times, takes your brain away from the other chaos and then the rhythm and the oxygen levels calm your pulse, and your body sorta tricks your mind into ""everything's calm here, let's rest."" Here's the technique from a source I don't recognize, but the information is consistent with what I've seen before from reputable sources: https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324417#what-is-it

Also, podcasts. I usually set a podcast to play on a sleep timer and put it at a low volume. Especially if I've done the breathing and or taken the trazodone, my main focus on a quiet voice or two becomes drowsily missing pieces of the story, then becomes ... morning. I listened to the entire archive of the public radio OG ""podcast"" This American Life when I moved to Times Square. Quiet, smart voices telling interesting stories about a variety of topics. Also have used a podcast called Nothing Much Happens that's a sorta ASMR whispering voice telling stories with lots of details and minimal plot. I've also used guided meditation for sleep with the Calm app. (i'd use that app all the time if I could afford it)

I hope some of this is helpful.","how do you fall asleep in bed within  hour ive only been medicated for a couple months with stimulants and sleep comes so much more easily because i think im not agitated and anxious and thinking a ton of thoughts because i actually got things done sleep comes more easily

clonidine,"How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour? There are a lot of responses but to anyone who sees this comment, my recommendation is listening to deep, super low frequency sleep music. 

There are a few on YouTube that I listen to, which I will link below (no they are not my channels/I am completely unaffiliated, just linking the ones I like.) A few of the videos have titles like “put you to sleep in 5 minutes” which sounds gimmicky until you realize it actually did. I put them on my tv (a lot of them go to “black screen”) and it always puts me to sleep. You might have to try a few different ones to get the one that you like the best. Some of them have like “melodies” which I find don’t work for me. 

Melatonin works also.

Another one for when your brain just won't quit and the zippy thoughts are keeping you awake, at least in my experience, is to have yourself a coffee.

1. I vape Indica.  A few hits of my vape and I am relaxed then suddenly so sleepy I can’t keep my eyes open.  It is good sleep, too.
2. I try to listen to audio books, specifically any Terry Pratchett book narrated by Nigel Planer.  There is something so soothing about it that even though I am totally into the story, I can’t stay awake longer than ten or so minutes.
3. Podcasts.  Similarly to audio books, there are a few podcasts where I find the person speaking so soothing.  It is like listening to a friend speak.  I feel safe and comforted.  My three are Sarah Turney from Voices for Justice, Sadie Carpenter from Leaving Eden, and Robert Evans from Behind the Bastards.
4. Music.  This used to be my go-to as a teen and in my dorm in college.  I would wear headphones and zone out.  Since I have shared a bed with a partner, I haven’t done this…mostly because I don’t want to accidentally start singing along! ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
5. I play word puzzle games on my phone.  Any other type of game doesn’t work because I will want to keep playing it.  But figuring out specific words from a group of random letters is what tires out the part of my brain that has trouble turning off.

clonidine,"How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour? Insomnia starts when you're taking longer than usual to fall asleep, and you start to worry about not getting enough sleep. At this point, the anxiety is actually keeping you awake. The more anxious you get, the less you sleep, the more anxious you get, the less you sleep. 

Feeling tired during the day is a bit shit, but it won't kill you and it will make sleep come more easily the following evening, so you don't actually have anything to worry about. Your body knows what to do. If you adopt some good sleep hygiene habits, the problem will most likely sort itself out. It's not easy, because night time is the most enjoyable time to be awake (at least in my opinion) but if you have the discipline to follow the rules you can probably fix this in a few weeks.

1. Wake up at the same time every single day. Never sleep in, ever. If you have a consistent wake-up time, your body will get used to the routine and waking up will start to feel easier. If you sleep in on weekends (for example) it will be harder to get to sleep the following night, and your whole circadian rhythm will shift backwards, so you have to spend the following week trying to catch up. It's not worth it. A consistent wake-up time will stabilise your circadian rhythm, and then your bedtime routine will fall in line.

2. Don't stay in bed if you're not sleeping. Give it 10 to 15 minutes, and if you don't fall asleep, get up, go to another room, and read a book (or do something else quiet and relaxing - no screens). Go back to bed when you feel sleepy. Rince and repeat until you fall asleep. Also, don't stay in bed during the day. If you do daytime things in bed, your body will be conditioned to be alert in your bedroom environment, which is not what you want. Bed is only for sleeping (and sex, if you're lucky).

3. Get a big dose of daylight as soon as you wake up, to help shift your circadian rhythm forwards, and avoid light at night (particularly blue light) as this can shift your circadian rhythm backwards. There is some debate as to how much this actually matters, but it costs you nothing to be mindful of the effect blue light can have on your sleep cycle.

4. Melatonin supplements may help put you to sleep, but it never worked for me. 

5. Take a hot bath/shower before bed. When you get out, your core body temperature drops a little, and your brain takes this as a signal that it's time to sleep. 

6. Be aware of the stimulants you're consuming, and how your body responds. Also food and alcohol.

7. Exercise in the mornings. 

8. Make sure the bedroom is dark, and quiet, and the right temperature.

9. Get rid of any electronics that have the potential to grab your attention. This includes any visible clocks, at least until you're sleeping better. You don't need to know what time it is. It's sleep'O'clock; that's all you need to know! 

10. If you tried all of this, consistently, for a few weeks, and it isn't working, consider going to see a sleep specialist. 

Good luck.","how do you fall asleep in bed within  hour insomnia starts when youre taking longer than usual to fall asleep and you start to worry about not getting enough sleep at this point the anxiety is actually keeping you awake the more anxious you get the less you sleep the more anxious you get the less you sleep

Go to bed an hour earlier. My ADHD therapist told me one piece of advice that has been so hugely helpful. ""You have time blinders. You will never remember all the little things before a task so plan for it. Assume any major task needs one hour of lead up time.

So for example if on Saturday I need to grocery shop, mow the law, visit my friend for coffee, and go to the gym, my schedule should look like this

8-Getup
9-Gym
10-prep time
11-Groceries
12-prep time
1-coffee
2-prep time
3-mow the lawn
4-prep time
5-dinner & shower


Once you do it for a bit you get a better feel for it. But before I'd put say groceries and gym side by side, because i could go out and do both in the car. Well chatting with people at gym, staring vacantly at my phone in the parking lot, and forgetting grocery bags all have lead up time

So give yourself an extra hour of sleep. If you aim for 8 you're going to probably get 7 or 6. So aim for 9. I don't mean because it will take you an hour tossing and turning (that hour actually counts as sleep). I say in bed for 9 hours because of time blindness you need transition and safety time built in. 

Another big one for somw people is ADHD meds can cause insomnia. Check with your doctor and think about switching it might help.

Finally I know y'all hate to hear it, but it's the same advice you've always been told. Establish a good routine and never break it. No phones 1 hour before bed. Bed same time, up same time each day. Go to the gym. ect. Think of each good sleep hygiene thing you do as 1 point and each routine you lock in will make it easier to get good sleep.It takes takes an average person 2 months to form a habit, takes an ADHDer twice as long. but once you do it will pay dividends for years. 


I've worked on all this stuff for the past decade. Until very recently I tossed and turned for hours each night. As a 19 year old my mom still had to get me up to go to school. At 31 I actually fall asleep at a decent time, and feel rested during the day. It makes all your ADHD symptoms so much better.


TLDR: Slowly build up a good routine. Work at 1 thing at a time. Give yourself an extra hour to be safe. Changing meds can sometimes help.","how do you fall asleep in bed within  hour tldr at bottom

clonidine,"How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour? Once I'm in bed, under the blankets with the light off, I fall asleep in less than 5 minutes basically every single time. 

This didn't used to be the case. I used to lay in bed for an hour plus trying to sleep almost every night, but after adjusting my sleep habits that changed rapidly. 

Part of the reason many people have trouble sleeping (as a health and wellness coach with much continuing education in sleep), is their bed habits and sleep schedule. 

When we're in our bedroom under the blankets, it should be strictly for sleep (or maybe sex but even this I do on top of the blankets now). But a lot of us do many things in our beds under the covers. Like watch TV, eat snacks, scroll our phone, play video games etc. When we do other things, our brains learn to associate bed with those other things instead of sleep. 

Once people are able to change what they do in their beds under the covers, their brains will learn to associate differently with it. 

So now, once I turn the lights off and get under the covers in a bed, my brain knows the ONLY thing I do in that situation is sleep. And often I literally fall asleep in less than 2 minutes (which isn't always good, as sometimes when we fall asleep *too* rapidly it can indicate severe exhaustion). But I have very regular sleep hours and I've built a very strong association with my brain and sleep when I'm under the covers. 

If you're just going to do other things in bed regardless they should be with at least some lights on and on top of the blankets. 

Also our sleep hours should be as regular as possible (what time we get in bed to sleep and wake up for the day), even on weekends. This helps regulate our bodies natural rhythm and processes and will improve sleep processes.

Our environment can also play a role in sleep and sleep quality, but unless its just overly hot/cold or bright every night, it's usually bed habits that keep people laying in bed forever not able to fall asleep.

Edit: also, supplementing melatonin can mess with our body's natural production over the long term and isn't a very good solution. It's more a cover up then a true fix","how do you fall asleep in bed within  hour once im in bed under the blankets with the light off i fall asleep in less than  minutes basically every single time

clonidine,"How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour? I'm pretty exhausted at bed time to be honest but I do all the typical sleep hygiene tips: go to sleep and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. Use bed only for sleep and intimacy. When I wake up I get sunlight in my eyeballs to support circadian rhythm. At bedtime I take magnesium and melatonin. I read an actual physical book. When I start getting sleepy, I switch to watching asmr videos on YouTube until I can't keep my eyes open any more.

I do sometimes have problems staying asleep. I'll wake up in the night and my brain starts going and I can't fall back asleep. A technique I learned to deal with that is called ""put it in the box."" Imagine a box to put your anxieties in. Imagine everything about the box - size, color, details. I usually fall back asleep before I can finish imagining the box. Counting backwards from 100 where I try to picture each number in my mind also usually works. 

Exercise helps a lot with sleep. Yesterday I got more physical activity than usual and slept soo good last night.

Ive never really had an issue falling asleep. In fact, I’ve one a few bets against people that didn’t believe I could fall asleep in a certain situation. But I also don’t sleep a lot. Overheard someone say the above quote and it made me feel a lot better about how little I sleep. I don’t know if I’ve tricked myself into thinking I can function off of four to five hours a night or if I actually can. My dad and brothers are the same way just not to the extreme I can take it.

In the event that I find myself laying in bed long before I want to actually sleep (on vacation or something) I just let my brain go loose. I basically fantasize on auto-pilot. Not sure if I’m actually sleeping, but I’ll eventually fall asleep without noticing and feel rested. I haven’t always been able to do this though.

I've struggled with this a lot in my life, and uncovered some cool hacks. First, honestly, is my phone. I charge it within arms reach but try to not look at it for an hour or so before bed. If you do, try using a blue light protector or blue light glasses or something. Same, but less so with the tv.

Next, when I notice myself unable to sleep, I immediately get on my back. Idk why but that's where I fall asleep best. I think maybe bc it's most relaxing?

Lastly, I close my eyes and focus on my breath. It's not a counting technique per se, but it's just trying to get you to zero in on something so the background noise in my head starts to subside. You can count them, but I find that gets me drifting again (work with numbers and associate them to stupid shit all the time). I find a simple 'in through your nose, out through your mouth' mantra works fine, or when I'm getting more tired 'in... out'.

I use my favorite series because it is enjoyable and comforting, but also it’s familiar so my brain doesn’t get hyperfixated on novelty. And probably most importantly, I don’t ever hang out in my bed/bedroom. The bed is only for sleep and sex.

clonidine,"How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour? Well, I currently do sleep therapy as I would lay in bed wide awake for up to five hours before falling asleep. Apparently you have to cut off all the hours you don’t sleep, and just go to bed at the time when you start feeling sleepy (not tired, but sleepy) and can actually fall asleep. This may however involve you going to bed very late, at a non traditional time (if you have a delayed sleeping pattern like me). For me, the difference is striking. I fall asleep within minutes compared to after hours before. I didn’t change anything else.

clonidine,"How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour? I always had sleeping problems, insomnia, diagnosed PTSD & anxiety & and not knowing ADHD.
For the most of my life I wished I could fall asleep and stay sleep for more than 4-5 hours :(

So, I had been on sleeping pills(PSTD nightmares) & melatonin (10~20mg) to help me fall sleep and stay asleep for avg. 8:30 
quality sleep (my mattress tracks my vital and sleep Q - I know, I saved for it, it’s fancy 🙄 but getting a good sleep has changed my life (back issue, hot sleeper, waking up tired and grumpy GONE) but you don’t need those)

NOW, that I’m diagnosed with ADHD (to add it to my mental disorder list 😂) and started taking meds (Adderall), my brain is SO much more clear that:
- I’m having very relax & calm daytime; no more 24/7 anger, agitation, million of thoughts at night, etc
- I manage to go to bed on a schedule (I have been doing it for some time but got more organized after meds!!)
- I can finally do meditation (just breathing nothing special on YouTube )
- STOPPED taking melatonin! (I was very nervous for stopping it)

Tips:

- I love a rainforest plays before bed and stops 30 min! This made me stop using phone before bed(or some light podcasts again on timer) 
- I shut every single window, lights
- try to have lowest amount of noise or sound in the room (I tried sleeping with ear plugs for years-didn’t help at all)
- make sure your bed feels cool (at least to touch) & the room temp is as close as 65F
- if you feel your body feels warm or hot on the mattress, make sure you have Tencel (breathable fiber to exchange air) mattress protector (don’t buy trash from target, Costco, Amazon)
- make sure you have the best mattress you can afford for your sleeping position (side, back or stomach sleeper- it’s also a sign of sleeping hot!)

I’m a trained mattress expert and have witnessed how a mattress/pillow/ the room makes ppl sleep so their life SO different.

I know it’s hard but you will get way better sleep this way. Make your couch or some area like that a comfortable space where you can lounge around so that you don’t have to do it in your bed.

clonidine,"How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour? I use box breathing but exhale to a count of 6 then rest to a count of 2, equaling 8. I do this because when I exhale I also do progressive muscle relaxation and in traditional box breathing I feel like I have to exhale really fast to do it in 4 seconds and that can turn into hyperventilating trying to stay within the amount of seconds, plus not enough time for PMR. (yes I am autistic.)
So while I inhale, I count to 4. While I hold it, I count to 4. While I exhale and then rest i slowly release the tension in my muscles, and I count to 8. Then start again. While I am exhaling, I do progressive muscle relaxation (PMR)
Inhale...2...3...4
Rest...2...3...4
Exhale (and do PMR)...2..3..4..5...hold...7...8
Repeat 

You'll fall asleep in 20 mins as soon as you get the rhythm down and stop counting in your head. 

It is REALLY CHALLENGING to get into the rhythm when you first start if you've had a tension filled day or are otherwise escalated emotionally. You HAVE to push through the feelings of wanting to breath faster and tense your muscles...those are *awake* feelings.... measured breathing and relaxed muscles are *asleep* feelings so you just have to push through the beginning to get yourself into the rhythm. 

Hope this helps!

P.s. if doing stuff like this at bedtime does not help, you'll need to start doing stuff during your waking hours that contributes to a good night sleep, such as 30 minutes of cardio, regular day time meditation, or even therapy and medication. I used to stay awake for days before I got put on medication, and I'm not even bipolar or anything, just insomniac. I take the lowest dose of seroquel at night and it makes me sleep almost like a normal person, but the above method is how I fall asleep instead or staying awake thinking.","how do you fall asleep in bed within  hour i use box breathing but exhale to a count of  then rest to a count of  equaling  i do this because when i exhale i also do progressive muscle relaxation and in traditional box breathing i feel like i have to exhale really fast to do it in  seconds and that can turn into hyperventilating trying to stay within the amount of seconds plus not enough time for pmr yes i am autistic
so while i inhale i count to  while i hold it i count to  while i exhale and then rest i slowly release the tension in my muscles and i count to  then start again while i am exhaling i do progressive muscle relaxation pmr
inhale
rest
exhale and do pmrhold
repeat 

youll fall asleep in  mins as soon as you get the rhythm down and stop counting in your head 

it is really challenging to get into the rhythm when you first start if youve had a tension filled day or are otherwise escalated emotionally you have to push through the feelings of wanting to breath faster and tense your musclesthose are awake feelings measured breathing and relaxed muscles are asleep feelings so you just have to push through the beginning to get yourself into the rhythm 

hope this helps

clonidine,"How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour? There are a couple of things that help me. 

1) Winding down before bed; a couple of hours before i intent to sleep i close my curtains and put on very dim diffuse light and listen some relaxing music. I use this time to put on my pyjamas,  brush my teeth, plan/prepare the next day and do some cleaning etc... When im done i watch a chill yt video or podcast in bed. 

2) I remind myself of this routine with several labeld alarms in my phone. One 5 min before it starts, one when it starts and one when it ends and i try to sleep. 

3) I try to get some exercise and light through out the day.

4) Not going to bed when im unregulated/ anxious/ hungry etc. If im not in a good mental state then i cant sleep and i will end up feeling worse. I try to take care of that before i start my bed time routine. 

5) Not starting a task or activity that i could end up hyper focusing on. That way i will end up loosing track of time and or delaying my routine. It could also keep me awake because ill keep thinking about it in bed. 

6) Keeping melatonin around just in case. I also have an alarm for that. 

7) Comforting sensory stuff like a hot cup of tea comfy clothes etc. 

8) Listing things in my head after the Alphabet stops racing thoughts for me;

A- Apple
B- Banana 
C- Cucumber 
D- ...

clonidine,"How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour? I don’t know the nature of your insomnia but I have cured mine on my own without medicine. Maybe this will help you. I know I’ve helped many people by telling them my method and it’s worked for them as well.    


The reason I was an insomniac is because, like you, my mind would not shut down enough to fall asleep. The thoughts weren’t necessarily negative, just incessant. Whether it be thinking about things I had to do, or something funny that happened two years ago or why birds have such funny mating habits… my brain would just think. For hours. Until the stress over not sleeping set in.     


A lot of insomnia is the result of having a bad bought of not sleeping (a few days or a week or so) and then the panic that ensues takes over so that the reason for not sleeping is simply because you go into sleeping afraid your won’t sleep.     


Anyway, let me tell you my method and maybe it might help you. I’ve been doing it for 6 years now and haven’t needed medication anymore.   


You’ll need a paper white Kindle, The other thing is a relatively new product and has made it so much better, but it’s an external page turner. One piece clips on the kindle and the other piece is a small button you keep in your hand so you can turn the page just by pressing the button in your hand.     


If you’re thinking you’re not a reader, try and not worry about that. A lot of people who don’t like to read is because they haven’t found what they like or styles they like. Anyway, back to the method.    


Turn the lights out, lie down and get comfortable, and hold the kindle or prop it up with some pillows (get a clip/stand that makes it easier to do so). Turn the light setting on the lowest setting there is but make the font a bit larger until you can read the words comfortably. Since you have the button to turn the page, it’s not as annoying as having to touch the screen every few moments to turn the page.    


At some point, you’ll start to feel sleepy. This is the key to this method. Close your eyes when this happens and don’t put the kindle or button away. The reason why this is important is because once you put the book to the side, you are telling your brain it has to commit to sleeping now. By leaving it as it is you are telling it that if you’re not ready for sleep, all you have to do is open your eyes and continue reading. Since you’re not commiting to sleep, the brain most likely won’t drift to all the invasive thinking that keeps an active brain awake.    



When I first started doing this, It was often I would open my eyes back up again, as I just wasn’t ready to drift off yet. Now that I’ve been doing it for so many years, usually the first time I close my eyes is the last time I do. Not always though.   

If this sounds like something you’d like to try and aren’t a reader, I could help you figure out what kind of books you would like. I am a huge speculative and science fiction fan. I have recommendations for days.","how do you fall asleep in bed within  hour i dont know the nature of your insomnia but i have cured mine on my own without medicine maybe this will help you i know ive helped many people by telling them my method and its worked for them as well

I think there were many practices that helped me (I didn't do them all at once or consistently, but when I felt they could help me):

- Writing a small journal of what I did today and what I want to do the next few days, so I'm not thinking about all of that and moving around a lot because of that
- Drinking enough water and/or tea throughout the day, but not too much for bed. Also I go to the toilet before bed, I can never sleep when I have to pee and sometimes I don't notice it until I get up and just go the toilet after one hour of just lying there
- Digital hygiene by putting on bedtime mode on my phone, so that the screen goes warm (lessening blue light from the screen) around 5-6pm, and going full monochrome like an hour before bed and of course muting notifcations and rings
- Not doing something stimulating for the 1-2 hours before bed because else I just cannot rest at all afterwards most of the time and start fidgeting a lot
- And lastly, what helped a lot was just relaxing my muscles by tensing them all at once for a couple of seconds (by making fists, activating all muscles in the face, etc.), then letting them loose at the same time and then saying something repeating in your head (like just ""don't think, don't think, ...). That did the trick quite often.

I don’t know if this is related to ADHD but I personally don’t have any problems with insomnia or actually falling asleep at all, even on stimulant medication. If I’m getting into bed and have the lights off and done everything I need to beforehand and listen to my body when I’m tired, I can usually fall asleep pretty easy within maybe 10-15 minutes max. My problem usually stems from not feeling like I have to force myself to stay awake and not go to sleep until I can get something done, whether it be a bedtime routine like brushing my teeth or taking a shower both of which I push off at night and procrastinate even though I don’t mean to, or getting a household chore like folding laundry done, or getting like schoolwork done. I feel like with really bad executive dysfunction I can’t control when I start a task so the only thing I can control is holding myself to things like preventing my day from ending until I get whatever it is done. But often that in and of itself isn’t a motivating factor and it just leads to me staying up through the night to get what I need to done, even if I’m tired. Which in turn, flips my circadian rhythm later and later.

clonidine,"How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour? I do a form of meditation right before bed. I do some stretches to help my back. Then I lay on the ground with my butt up to the bed and my calves and feet resting on the bed. Then, I just focus on my breathing. if another though comes, I gently go back to my breathing. I have a timer set for 10 min. Start with 5 and work your way up to it. You want it to be short enough that you can stay relatively focused. Once you aren't getting through it without major lapses of focus, move up to 10 min. 

Once it goes off, I double-check and activate my alarms and lock myself out of my phone with an app called ""lock my phone,"" and then I get into bed.

Locking my phone before I get into bed is important as I will likely hop on reddit or tiktok, and then there goes that night.

I think of meditation like practicing focusing. Now, I may choose other things to meditate on, but it can't be something I will hyperfocus on. Things like: good memories, simple things that make me happy. I may also listen to calm instrumental music.

This has huge benefits. It forms a routine that helps with falling asleep faster. As well as improves sleep quality. I use an app that monitors my sleep and wakes me up when I'm in a more ""awake"" phase of sleep.(called ""sleep cycle"") It also measures sleep quality, and meditation shows a 19% increase in sleep quality for me.

clonidine,How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour? The more you worry about sleeping the less likely you are to fall asleep. Plenty of tips in here already stated but for me starting meditation years ago helped me realize my first sentence and learn to relax and let the day slip away and not panic about the next and the things I’ve been procrastinating on etc. There are still occasional bad days where I cant sleep hardly at all or wake up a couple hours into the night and toss and turn the rest of the night but they are few and far between I’d say once a month or so. Melatonin never worked for me cause it either made me drowsy the whole next day or it wouldn’t work at all cause I wasn’t getting the relaxation part right to fall asleep. I don’t routinely meditate anymore really but the principles are still there that I use most nights or I do a little unguided one in my head and that helps me in most cases if my brain is stubborn. Get a good sleep schedule going and I recommend using a smart watch to track your sleep to help with that. Those health apps that come on our phones basically give you tips and everything you need to know to do that. It has helped me get interested in getting the best sleep possible like a game I track on my phone. Good luck and remember it’s a journey like coping with adhd.

I used to lay awake for 2-4 hours every night, worse to no sleep at all if I’d have to get up somewhat early.

clonidine,"How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour? At first I used a guided meditation for sleep on the Medito app (it's ***free***! A great resource for meditation, guided breathing, relaxation, nature sounds, etc and also has a playlist to teach you how to meditate). You imagine you're on an endless staircase making your way down to something. As you go it gets darker and darker and you count every step. Eventually after a few hundred you fall asleep. Once I got used to that I started adding my own detail to it -- I imagine lush forests, fairytale landscapes, the seaside, etc (all at dusk, twilight, or sunset) and I'm on a long staircase that starts way up in the sky and I'm trying to get to the ground. Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn't. Lately I've just been imagining counting stars or sheep and that has worked fairly well. 

I also take melatonin and magnesium which get me to sleep in about half an hour. The melatonin has helped reprogram my brain into a more immediate ""I'm in bed, so it's time for sleep."" I journal most nights before bed to help get thoughts off my head, but I focus on the good stuff that happened today. Not in a toxic positivity way, but in a ""not everything is awful"" way, if that makes sense?  


TL;DR: Try Medito - it's ***free***! Melatonin and magnesium are cheap and may help. Keeping a journal may also help.","how do you fall asleep in bed within  hour at first i used a guided meditation for sleep on the medito app its free a great resource for meditation guided breathing relaxation nature sounds etc and also has a playlist to teach you how to meditate you imagine youre on an endless staircase making your way down to something as you go it gets darker and darker and you count every step eventually after a few hundred you fall asleep once i got used to that i started adding my own detail to it    i imagine lush forests fairytale landscapes the seaside etc all at dusk twilight or sunset and im on a long staircase that starts way up in the sky and im trying to get to the ground sometimes this works sometimes it doesnt lately ive just been imagining counting stars or sheep and that has worked fairly well

clonidine,"How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour? I downloaded the app Tappy: Self care fidgeter onto my phone probably a year and a half ago. It has a bunch of features that I think HAD to be intended for us folk. Things like:

1. Tapping the guy “Tappy” in the middle of your screen; you can change his face depending on “his”/your mood, and change haptics like the kind of vibration your phone makes every tap and if you want it to make a sound or not. It also counts how many total taps you have made

2. There’s a daily affirmation tab you can read and scroll through a few if you’re feeling really crappy. 

3. Over 20 fidgeting features to tap and interact with. 

4. An Arcade with in app games. With an app leaderboard. 

5. And the main reason I am telling you this: the Relaxation page. It has a bunch of noises that you can choose to play that keep going even when your phone is off. It can vibrate your phone too if you like to hold it in your hands when you sleep. My favourite noises are Rain, Thunder, and Jungle, but there are others like Wood Wick Candle, Cat Purring, and Train too

You can also pay $4.99 CAD monthly or $24.99 CAD annually for Tappy Plus, where you can access more sounds, the fidget spinner and more.

clonidine,"How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour? I count to 3,000. The first week or so, I would get up to like 5500 because my mind would wander and then I’d lose count and then I’d still be awake after 3,000 so I’d keep counting. It would take hours of counting, thinking about other stuff/etc, counting, getting distracted, counting, etc to reach 3,000. Between 2-4, but that’s how many hours I would struggle to fall asleep for anyway, so I used that thought track to convince myself to keep counting every night even if it didn’t seem to help me fall asleep any faster. “Well, I’m still allowing myself to wander with my thoughts, which is what I’d be doing for these hours anyway, so what’s the big deal of adding in some counting?” kinda logic to motivate myself to do it each night.

Anyway, I did this every night. Counted until I fell asleep. Allowed my mind to wander to other thoughts whenever it wanted as long as I eventually got back to counting. 

A little over a month later, I almost always fall asleep right before 3,000 - usually in less than an hour. In the last week, I think my biggest struggle night capped at ~3,700 and like an hour and a half before I fell asleep, so not bad at all for a “bad” night now! 

Anyway, if you can convince yourself to try it each night for at least a month, you might find that it eventually clicks in for you!

Watching videos isn’t great, though. Your brain 
/pineal gland needs darkness to produce melatonin. The pineal gland is what regulates our circadian rhythm, so if there’s light from screens, it’s going to disrupt that and make it harder to fall asleep. I’ve been (slowly) trying to phase out watching videos after I get in bed. It’s become such a habit that it’s hard to break. 

All of that said, making sure you’re fully and completely comfortable in your bed is underrated. I slipped on some ice in early February and landed on my shoulder. That in turn caused a massive tear in my rotator cuff (unknown at the time). There was no comfortable position really. I mentioned it to my physical therapist and he basically said “if we’re comfortable when we sleep, we don’t roll over.” and suggested I get some pillows to prop up my arm so that it was at the same level as my shoulder . I picked up 3 more pillows and tried it out. Life. Changing. I didn’t move once the whole night.

clonidine,"How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour? I’ve found that sometimes when I’m tired/sleepy bit can’t actually fall asleep, I try to focus on doing deep breathing exercises so that I can physically relax my body and relieve some of that lingering nervous energy, which might be a barrier preventing me from falling asleep. 

I also tend to want to daydream a lot while I’m trying to sleep, and I’ve realised that this often is just triggering my brain to continue to stay alert and delaying the process of allowing my body and mind to relax to a point where I can actually sleep. So whenever I notice this, I try to focus on emptying my brain and resisting the temptation to continue engaging in whatever thought pattern has my attention at that moment. 

If I’m struggling with my brain feeling unstimulated/wanting to think about something, I’ll try and focus on something monotonous like counting my breaths or counting to the highest number I can. If none of these strategies work after a certain amount of time, I’ll try a low dose of melatonin (ideally on top of these other strategies and that’s usually enough.","how do you fall asleep in bed within  hour ive found that sometimes when im tiredsleepy bit cant actually fall asleep i try to focus on doing deep breathing exercises so that i can physically relax my body and relieve some of that lingering nervous energy which might be a barrier preventing me from falling asleep

clonidine,"How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour? I notice that when I get a good 9 hours of sleep, I feel better and my ADHD symptoms are not nearly as bad and I feel like I don’t have as much brain fog. In addition, my mood is better. When I have an insanely busy week, and don’t want to forget to mention that I’m medicated. I must keep a regular dose regiment and a regimented bed routine to maximize the quality of sleep. If I take my meds too late, or an eaten one to get through a late work event, then my sleep cycle gets screwed up quickly. That results in being tired and maybe taking an extra dose of meds to help with having a building sleep deficit, which will usually backfire only compounding things, making cognitive  function worse until you reach a point where your brain is mush and you finally crash. 

Last, I used my Apple Watch to track my nightly sleep. I’ve found on night where I get deep sleep, even if it’s only 30 minutes, that makes a huge difference. I also use and just got a new CPAP. Using that nightly makes. Huge difference in how alert I am when I wake up, and how quickly I get ready and to work. 

Falling asleep, that’s always been a crap shoot. Some nights I can go right to sleep. Most nights I toss and turn for N hour or two and have had nights where I don’t fall asleep at all.

clonidine,"How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour? i'm sure someone else has probably suggested something similar, but i cannot recommend something like Headspace's sleepcasts enough. they're like a podcast but meant to be more relaxing. they have a ton of different narrators so even if you're picky about disembodied voices like myself, there'll be at least one person you like. they start with a short and sweet meditation exercise and then is a 30-40 minute story. this gives me something to focus on and think about that isn't as distracting as a normal podcast or tv show or something (and doesn't require a screen to be on, helping with sleep hygiene). 

my number 1 issue with tips to meditate to sleep is no matter how hard i try, i cannot focus on the meditation, i always wind up distracted. having the story to listen to was a great way to bridge that, plus you can continue whatever exercise they start off with while listening to the story so it's an extra thing to think about (ie your breathing plus the story). i listen to one of these literally every single night and it's been revolutionary in helping me get to sleep. on particularly hard nights, i might go through 2 before actually getting to sleep but even that is better than the normal 2-3 hours. also, if i wake up in the middle of the night and have trouble getting back to sleep, i'll throw one on as a little reset.

I didn’t get my hopes up because even though all the information I’d read was optimistic, it just felt impossible anymore.

Well, I actually started SLEEPING THROUGH THE NIGHT. The trick is to have headphones comfortable enough to wear while laying down. I popped on my eye mask to block out and/all light source stimulation and popped the headphones in my ears and then laid down and let the magic happen. 

Disclaimer: I’ve also been hella depressed lately so I don’t have the best environmental control group, but I can say this: My depression has never positively benefited my sleeplessness. It’s only ever made it worse. So I’m thinking the improvement is more so related to the new form of stimulation than my moods.

clonidine,"How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour? So back when I was a kid/teenager, I'd sometimes be lying awake for quite a while, and would take to staring at my digital clock, being the only source of light in the room.

I devised a game to play with it I called, ""Eights and Naughts,"" where I would watch the clock, and in my mind, break apart the digits into their constituent 'blocks'* and try to rearrange them to make the most zeros or eights I could, with the least amount of surplus or negative blocks afterwards.

So e.g. if it was 11:47, I could use the 2 blocks from each '1' to make the '7' into a '0', with 1 block left. The '4' would need 2 blocks to make a zero, so I'd have -1 blocks left over, which I'd hope to make up when it flips to 11:48.
When 11:48 comes around, that 8 is already full, so I could use 3 blocks from the 2 '1's to turn the '4' into an '8', leaving me with a surplus of 1 block that would cancel my deficit from the previous minute.

I would play this game with myself until I fell asleep, which sometimes took 10-25 minutes, but usually only took a few minutes, as I'd get bored waiting for the next minute, start doing all the math in my head ahead of time, and fall asleep while calculating 3 or 4 minutes out.

* ""Blocks"" or whatever you want to call the lights on an old digital clock that would light up or not to make up the numbers. 8's used 7; 0's used 6; 1's used 2; 2's, 3's & 5's used 5; 4's used 4; 7's used 3; 6's & 9's used 6.","how do you fall asleep in bed within  hour so back when i was a kidteenager id sometimes be lying awake for quite a while and would take to staring at my digital clock being the only source of light in the room

clonidine,"How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour? I have a few things I do (not always) to help me get to bed.

1. I make sure my bedroom is cold enough to make it feel really cozy in bed (this is harder in summer since I don't have AC).

2. If I know I can't sleep or will have a hard time I do some stretches before sleep. Nothing too intense, the point is to relax my body and focus a bit on my breathing. This helps make me more comfortable in bed and makes my mind a bit more quiet. I find it easier than regular meditation because your body becomes a big fiddle toy. It also helps the ""crashing"" process as you will feel a little more tired after doing so.

3. An hour before I go to bed I start to mentally prepare. I go to bed around 11 PM, so by 10 PM it's ""before bedtime time"". I try to not het into a new TV show, if I can I want to turn off all my screens (this really happens irl tho). The most important thing is that I don't start anything new (no hyperfixation possibilities) and that I just take some time to transition. I feel this helps with revenge procrastination, as you give yourself an hour of just being there. I sometimes make myself a cup of tea, play with my cat, etc. 

4. Make sure my bedroom is DARK. I'm a super light sleeper so it has to be dark, or I will wake up. I also wear good quality reusable earplugs meant for side sleepers whenever I know there will be noise (if my partner doesn't come to bed immedietly for example)","how do you fall asleep in bed within  hour i have a few things i do not always to help me get to bed

clonidine,"How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour? Ok,  this is a crazy answer,  and requires discipline and practice,  but here you are:

- you need transplant yourself into a reality where none of your usual thoughts are going to bother you. I like to visualise an 18th century farm labourers hut.

- Then,  you get fully dressed in imaginary clothes that have nothing to do with your own life.  (So, I get dressed into 18th century farm labourers clothes)

If at any point your mind wanders,  you have to start again (this is where the discipline comes into it)

- Then, when you're fully dressed in the imaginary clothes, you have to do an imaginary repetitive task that has nothing to do with your real life. So, for me,  that's harvesting barley by hand and tying into into sheafs. It's important to focus on the imaginary sensory info. (Hot sun, prickley barley stems etc)

-Have a night routine so you get in the right mindset for sleep. What that means is up to you. May be a shower hot shower, a cup of tea etc.
- Have good sleep hygiene
-try to switch from screen to paper. I like doing sudoku while I wind down those last few gears
- learn your circadian rhythm. If you don’t get sleepy until 10 it won’t help to get to bed at 9. If you don’t get sleepy until midnight you will only stress yourself out if you go to bed at 8.
- If you have a circadian rhythm like me who doesn’t get sleepy sometimes until 2am… consider getting sleep medications to keep bedtime as early as your body allows. 🥲","how do you fall asleep in bed within  hour from an insomniac

clonidine,"How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour? The way I think about it is, you'll never fall asleep if you are outside of your mind or aware of anything outside of your body; so if you are paying attention to sounds, light or smells etc. I have to find a way to stay in my mind for as long as possible without recognising anything outside of it. The best way I do it is think of the longest routine or steps of an activity I can, and then double down and break those steps down into smaller steps and imagine doing/ describe them in vivid detail. So I usually go for my morning routine. I explain it to myself in my head, what it looks like etc. So I say I wake up, then I roll over, then I turn off my alarm etc etc in so much detail. If I snap out of my mind I have to start again. Works for me most of the time.

If you have a partner, consider this: 

A few years ago I got super stoned, this was before getting medicated/diagnosed, I came to bed with my fiancé with my mind running amok. She often falls asleep in minutes (literally timed it to 3 minutes flat out snoring sometimes haha) so this time I just listened to her breathing. I noticed it changed as she was falling asleep, getting deeper with slight pauses at the peak and valley, so I focused my attention on her breath and tried best to copy it. Moments pass and I feel calm, asleep in minutes. This was it for me, before I would lay there for hours sometimes and get frustrated that I just couldn’t stop my brain from doing brain things. 

Later I learned that this is similar to a practice called box breathing, a form of meditation, that helps change our thought patterns and can regulate our nervous system. 

Good luck fellow humans.","how do you fall asleep in bed within  hour this should be top comment great advice

clonidine,"How do you fall asleep in bed within 1 hour? When you get to 5th-6th decade, that will catch up to you.  Many issues of “middle age” come from chronic lack of sleep which affects every system in our body.  

When I made sleep a priority, it’s been helping with the adhd symptoms. 

I say tbis at 2 am, unable to sleep for no reason other than… it’s another day. I cycle.  I get about 3 days of stellar sleep, stay up too late one night because I’ve found something to focus on and then the next few nights I sleep like crap.  

Most of my life I went to bed last and got up first and one of my mottos was “I’ll sleep when I’m dead”…. I have worried about missing “something” if I am sleeping for as long as I can remember.  

I live alone.. not going to miss anything going on while I sleep. Lol

Therapist asked me how my sleep was… normal, I said.  Because i didn’t realize this pattern.  

It used to be, all these years, the nights i can’t sleep I toss and turn and bitch and moan and be miserable. Now if feel that toss/turn feeling come on I do some deep breathing, that doesn’t work I get up and have a cup of coffee and usually with in 2 hours I start nodding and that’s the cue for bed. ;)

Often wake up refreshed… but now in my 6th decade I take more naps.  Often I go back to bed in the morning after I feed my diabetic cat.

Plus only lasted like 2-3 hours before that crash, it was also inconsistent.

clonidine,"Stopped guanfacine and clonidine two months ago - still withdrawing? It could be the clonidine side effects for sure. I’m trying to wean off i was prescribed 0.1 in morning and at night for high blood pressure (i have ADHD but switched from Vyvanse to Dexedrine now). But i find 0.1 in morning is really prone to depression or melancholy if any stressful situation arises. I ran it by my doctor and tried to do 0.5mg for morning 0.5mg for afternoon and 0.1 before bed. I found after the morning dose, after about half-way thru the day it causes me to have withdrawal like symptoms- shortness of breath (blood pressure goes up) and start getting melancholy (possibly lack of oxygen). I tried 0.1mg in morning today- big mistake. Felt depressed “numb” feeling which is not normal for me.

clonidine,"How long does it take to adjust to clonidine? Currently trying out clonidine with my 6 year old and honestly? I'm not seeing that significant of a change. The first dose knocked him out which was concerning but I monitored him and he seemed fine the next day and had raving reviews from his teacher. The second day he didn't seem any different than his normal bouncy hyperactive inattentive self but could at least hold a conversation with me without darting all over the place. Day 3? He might as well be not taking anything. I think this is one of those meds that has a slight affect and mostly is supposed to help with sleep which then makes ADHD symptoms not as bad. But, the dose would probably have to be increased and I just don't know if it's even worth it. I think it depends on the kid, what type he is, and whether you've gone through the trial and error of other meds. I've not been able to find a lot on it versus Guanfacine but I want to say it's one of those that takes time to really get in their system and work. 2-3 weeks I would say.",how long does it take to adjust to clonidine currently trying out clonidine with my  year old and honestly im not seeing that significant of a change the first dose knocked him out which was concerning but i monitored him and he seemed fine the next day and had raving reviews from his teacher the second day he didnt seem any different than his normal bouncy hyperactive inattentive self but could at least hold a conversation with me without darting all over the place day  he might as well be not taking anything i think this is one of those meds that has a slight affect and mostly is supposed to help with sleep which then makes adhd symptoms not as bad but the dose would probably have to be increased and i just dont know if its even worth it i think it depends on the kid what type he is and whether youve gone through the trial and error of other meds ive not been able to find a lot on it versus guanfacine but i want to say its one of those that takes time to really get in their system and work   weeks i would say,[]
