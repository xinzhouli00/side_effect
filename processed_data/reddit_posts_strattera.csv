This is vague, but since I've started Strattera:

1. I have been able to be more consistent with discipline with my kids - which has led to better behaviors, bad habits leaving.

2. My coworker who still drives me nuts, drives me significantly less nuts because I've been able to draw boundaries.

3. I had some issues in my marriage (HUGE issues) that resolved.

4. I used to drink alot of liquor and wine, and I am now almost 10 days quit, and don't feel like I need that dopamine hit anymore.

5. My relationship with food has balanced out, normalized, and I don't feel like I can't control myself around food. Another dopamine issue.

Idk if this would help, but I stayed the course and things actually got better when I finally levelled out.","newly on strattera  i am the same way honestly i have a bit of a short fuse and i get really overstimulated very easily i feel like taking that medicine showed me how big of a mess my life was

strattera,"What symptoms did strattera help you with the most I did the same thing- starting at 25 and slowly increasing. Thought I might as well share my experience. 

Over the previous Jan-October I went from 25 to 50 to 75 as my body adapted. Found it was perfect for a bit at 50 and then was overcome with anxiety and depression- not too severe but negatively impacting my day to day. I upped it to 75 and the depression was so much worse. Got off and I think the issue was 50 was already too much but didn’t impact me until it has built up in my system after around 2-3 months. I wish I had gone down to 40 rather jumping up to 75 but I didn’t realize what was going on. I thought it wasn’t working because I had adapted too quick to the dose. I got off on halloween and woke up the next day no longer feeling depressed. Have been so happy and motivated since. Strange since the first 6 months I was on Strattera, it most definitely improved my mental health and worked as an anti depressant. I struggle with fatigue and it was no longer there. I could get so much done in my day to day and generally felt so much happier 24/7. It made getting through my shifts easy and my work ethic was incredible. It also helped with hunger cues and no longer was binging at night. I used to smoke weed 24/7 for a few years and then only at night by the end but Strattera immediately caused me to lose interest in it as I didn’t crave the relief anymore. While it made me happy and focused, it isolated my anxiety so that was there but manageable until about month 7. By August my sleep was just fever dreams and I was waking up more tired and stressed than before going to bed. Aside from that the nausea was impossible to deal with by the end.

strattera,"Just started, what’s going to happen? The palpations will stop being noticeable after your body and brain gets used to more noradrenalin circulating. The first few days were pretty intense for me too. I felt like I had drunk 3 cups of very strong coffee. The same feeling returned with each dose increase but quickly diminished.

My heart rate is consistently higher than when unmedicated. And when I'm moving about my day, its usually in the same range as you describe, and I dont even feel it anymore. It looks pretty wild to watch it be that high, but not dangerous. You'll get used to it soon enough.  Increased blood pressure is what you got to watch out for. 

Just wait when you watch the pill kick in. My heart rate briefly rises up to 150 sometimes, then falls back down to about 80-90 for the rest of the day. 😄 

I checked all this with my psych, by the way, and she was the one who told me it is common on the medication.

If you have trouble sleeping, then consider taking the pill in the morning. Some people get tired from it, others get a boost of energy, so you have to find the right time of the day for your body.

If you're experiencing severe side effects, a very fatty meal with a source high in protein (whether that's part of the meal or just a protein shake afterwards) will help dramatically smooth out the metabolic curve and keep it from hitting your guts all at once.

strattera,"Dysautonomia? It's not likely to do anything for POTS and might make it worse. I personally take it for ADHD and have not noticed worsening of my POTS while on it (except for the initial two weeks or so, but the side effects went away) but here's a study about how it often can make it worse: 

[Effects of norepinephrine reuptake inhibition on postural tachycardia syndrome](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24002370/)

> Conclusion: Norepinephrine reuptake inhibition with atomoxetine acutely increased standing HR and symptom burden in patients with POTS.

other forms of dysautonomia could theoretically benefit from it. here's a paper on the use of low dose atomoxetine in patients with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (which i guess makes sense because it's known to increase blood pressure):

[Efficacy of atomoxetine versus midodrine for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.50968)

however, here's another paper discussing how this property can mean that it can also cause hypertension (high blood pressure) in those with impaired autonomic function:

[Norepinephrine Transporter Blockade With Atomoxetine Induces Hypertension in Patients With Impaired Autonomic Function](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/hypertensionaha.107.089961)

> Atomoxetine, a selective norepinephrine transporter blocker, could increase blood pressure by elevating norepinephrine concentration in peripheral sympathetic neurons. This effect may be masked in healthy subjects by central sympatholytic mechanisms. To test this hypothesis we studied the pressor effect of 18 mg of atomoxetine (pediatric dose) in 21 patients with damage of the central (10 subjects) and peripheral (11 subjects) autonomic nervous system.

All this said, It is a great medicine and better than stims in my opinion (I have way to addictive personality so take that comment with a grain of salt).

Wish you the best, just make sure it doesn’t “blunt you”’or “put a lid” to heavily on your creative side and personality. I found higher doses did that also and I lost the real me.

You go back to default mode which you have to constantly actively fight from conscious mind.

strattera,"How did you guys deal with the constipation? It definitely depends on the thing you’re buying. With Metamucil being just a simple psyllium husk I don’t think it matters. But when it comes to generic medications apparently it does matter despite what I was told my entire life. My buddy was in PA school and did some massive research paper on generics. With brand name there is better quality control and they can often have patents on the release mechanism of a drug. Generics have to find their own release mechanism and have fillers, both of which can cause a medication to have an adverse effect on the patient. Not only that but the chemical chains of a generic can sometimes be flipped which makes them “legally correct” but can also cause them to be ineffective.

My insurance through my work has many barriers in place that do not allow me to circumvent the extreme cost of a brand name drug. I think the only way to get the brand name at a reasonable price for me would be if they ran out of generic and had to substitute. I can’t even have my psychiatrist order it with a DAW-1 code to avoid the cost. My stimulant still ends up being over $300 for a month.

Oh and your comment reminded me that “sugar free” stuff like candy that has a sugar replacement often has a laxative effect.","how did you guys deal with the constipation it definitely depends on the thing youre buying with metamucil being just a simple psyllium husk i dont think it matters but when it comes to generic medications apparently it does matter despite what i was told my entire life my buddy was in pa school and did some massive research paper on generics with brand name there is better quality control and they can often have patents on the release mechanism of a drug generics have to find their own release mechanism and have fillers both of which can cause a medication to have an adverse effect on the patient not only that but the chemical chains of a generic can sometimes be flipped which makes them legally correct but can also cause them to be ineffective

strattera,"Is it normal to titrate up so fast? Yeah, seems faster than what others usually mention on this subreddit. My doctor recommended me to take 50 mg for a few days and then increase to 80 mg.

I did as he recommended. 50 was not enough to give any positive effects, which I only started getting after being on 80 for a few days. 

It seems that some doctors are very careful with titration, probably because of side effects and for some people it works on lower dosages too.

i did as he recommended  was not enough to give any positive effects which i only started getting after being on  for a few days 

it seems that some doctors are very careful with titration probably because of side effects and for some people it works on lower dosages too

strattera,"Is it normal to titrate up so fast? The medication recommendations used to be (for adults) 40mg for 1 week then 80mg, but it recently changed to 3 days. If someone is very underweight or small, then there are recommendations to start a bit lower for tolerance.
The rationale for the fast jump is that the majority of people will get side effects with every single increase regardless and it will most likely take a while for them to adjust. So just jump to the therapeutic dose and wait out the side effects and be at the therapeutic dose instead of dragging it out and adding unnecessary adjustment times. 

I work in psychiatry (nurse) and the guidelines for antipsychotics and antidepressants are doing the same thing- we used to go up really slowly but then people were just sick still while waiting so long to get up to a dose that helps. They noticed in people who were very ill that people rushed treatment on were having adjustment periods the same as with lower doses but then getting better sooner because they were at therapeutic dose the whole time- so as more testing and experience is being done, meds that don’t have very severe side effects, basically you’re just checking for allergies or side effects and then diving in!

Edit to add: didn’t think I’d need to clarify this, but after being accused of being barbaric and trying to kill people… my explanation is for the general prescribing guidelines and is not intended to tell people to go against what their provider has told them to do!

The 60 was horrible for me. Although it helped my focus better, the side effects weren’t worth it for me. I felt high almost all day. Like a bad high, not a good one. It kept me from being able to do my job. At the end of the days, i would have melt downs. Like just such anxiety and depression all at once. I would feel numb and quiet throughout the day and then it’s like it would all hit me at once in the evening/ night. And i had bad suicidal episodes the last two days i was trying it.
I was told those side effects would probably go away eventually. But i wasn’t able to handle them even for that short amount of time. I don’t ever deal with depression or suicide normally so i knew it was from the meds. I switched back to my 40mg three days ago and been doing great since.

strattera,"Advice: Stopping Strattera After starting the 80 mg (3 days ago), my heart rate increased by 15 bpm.

strattera,"Advice: Stopping Strattera I don’t want to speak out of turn against what your doctor has advised you, but this just sounds like a way to extend your side effects. A lot of what’s online about this is that you don’t need to taper off in the same way you do with other medications you may be likely to have tried. I certainly wasn’t told to do this.  But if you’re going to do it, and of course I don’t advise against it since it’s what you’ve been advised to do by the person in charge of your care, I think the best thing would just be to make sure you take it easy and don’t put too many demands on yourself during the days that you’re tapering off. I know that may be easier said than done and you may have nonnegotiable obligations, but it would be my main thought on it. It’s about a month or so since I took a break from taking it and my resting heart rate is still messing me around a fair bit, confusingly! I hope it goes well for you, and I’m sorry that you couldn’t continue taking it when it was offering you clear benefits.",advice stopping strattera i dont want to speak out of turn against what your doctor has advised you but this just sounds like a way to extend your side effects a lot of whats online about this is that you dont need to taper off in the same way you do with other medications you may be likely to have tried i certainly wasnt told to do this  but if youre going to do it and of course i dont advise against it since its what youve been advised to do by the person in charge of your care i think the best thing would just be to make sure you take it easy and dont put too many demands on yourself during the days that youre tapering off i know that may be easier said than done and you may have nonnegotiable obligations but it would be my main thought on it its about a month or so since i took a break from taking it and my resting heart rate is still messing me around a fair bit confusingly i hope it goes well for you and im sorry that you couldnt continue taking it when it was offering you clear benefits,[]

strattera,"Advice: Stopping Strattera I was curious about this also. And now more curious as resting for an adult should be between 60-100 so somewhat within range.

What are you planning on switching to (if anything). And do you know if that medicine is likely to raise your HR?

Did you doc (or you), check your blood pressure also when Strattera was taken and in your system at fuller strength a few hours later, cause I’m sure that would be up also. I’m just not sure what meds don’t bring HR and BP up slightly.

What was your base HR so you know before Strattera?","advice stopping strattera i was curious about this also and now more curious as resting for an adult should be between   so somewhat within range

strattera,"Advice: Stopping Strattera I’m not switching to anything right now, we are gonna reassess how I feel once it’s out of my system first before adjusting!

strattera,"Advice: Stopping Strattera So interesting! My psych never offered stimulants since I have anxiety induced high blood pressure and take a Xanax prescription. So this was really my only option in the USA without completely switching my entire regimen. (I take Prozac as my main one).
Feeling so weird about it all since I did get mental benefits but I know that heart rate just is not appropriate especially with my blood pressure problems. Not really knowing where to turn next other than slight increase in Prozac….any tips would be much appreciated😅","advice stopping strattera so interesting my psych never offered stimulants since i have anxiety induced high blood pressure and take a xanax prescription so this was really my only option in the usa without completely switching my entire regimen i take prozac as my main one

strattera,"Advice: Stopping Strattera How long you been on meds or is this your first? I’ve done stimulants (that will def work the system), and basically all the meds under the sun, on the 40mg Strat and I found HIIT exercise will bring the BP down significantly and resting HR also.
