I still feel those symptoms: sadness, low self-esteem, no energy to do anything, forgetting things, procrastinating a lot, hard to concentrate and finish a task. I wondered if I had ADD. It all pointed to Adult ADD. I told my doc of my beliefs and maybe I was misdiagnosed. I tried more antidepressants which were having no effect. Then my therapist convinced my doctor to prescribe me Dexedrine 10mg just in the morning. The first day I took my pill, my eyes were open, the energy was there, and I couldn’t believe it worked.

tail 1,dizziness,"Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine) for ADHD""This medication is hard to find, which is unfortunate because, quite simply, it works on some ADHD people when other more common medications do not. Dextroamphetamine (generic)/Zenzedi (brand name) acts more on dopamine than norepinephrine. Adderall, which is dextroamp and levoamp, the latter affecting mostly norepinephrine, made me tired and flat--and hungry. Kind of a paradoxical reaction. It helped my emotional overreactivity, but not other ADHD symptoms like initiation of tasks and related anxiety/irritability, procrastination, and negative ruminations (mentally getting 'stuck'). Obviously, my brain needs help with dopamine, and too much norepinephrine is dulling and unpleasantly sedating. Those with similar reactions to Adderall (and/or methylphenidates like Ritalin) might want to give Dextroamphetamine a try. It feels like a totally different class of medication than Adderall to my (admittedly atypical) brain, and works great."""

Someone has suggested Zenzedi (tablet, not capsule). It is a generic-simply named. Anyone have any experience with it? Anyone have a similar experience with Teva or Aurobindo?

I have to point out, for those of you who like Adderall and the “speedy“ feeling you get from it, then Dexedrine may not be for you. However, if you are like me and don’t like feeling like you’ve taken a narcotic stimulant, then you should certainly try Dexedrine/dextroamphetamine… You won’t regret it!!

There's something wrong with the 5/10 mg tablets of Teva's Dexedrine. Teva is tainted or there's some other problem with it. Avoid!"""
tail 5,disturbance in attention,"Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine) for ADHD""I would suggest anyone on this, to stop or take a break once you've noticed your reasoning, memory recall abilities becoming hindered. Even though I'm happy with the benefits of focus, it's not worth losing your short-term memory. Over time, I noticed my math skills declined, followed by my word recall, spelling, and now I can't remember stories or study material. It's extremely debilitating, I'm trying to figure out how to reverse the side effects."""
tail 5,disturbance in attention,"Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine) for ADHD""Have been taking Dexedrine spansules (10 mg) for over 2 years, three times per day. I never knew I had rank ADHD all my life - problems with school, the law. I am 47 and have noticed my ambition for life has increased, having more energy. I used to be tired a lot, complaining, generally overall agitated. At the same time, I have many comorbidities to deal with but fortunately don't have to take any anxiety meds. Dexedrine is all I know, and I am satisfied with the results."""
tail 5,disturbance in attention,"Zenzedi (dextroamphetamine) for ADHD""I'm 37, was diagnosed with ADHD at 9. My parents thought it was rubbish due to my grades and voracious reading, and that my typical ADHD (and ASD) traits were me being lazy, immature, bratty, or oversensitive. After two decades of life failure (grades don't predict success), I sought treatment. Only Zenzedi (NOT any of the generic d-amps) helped reliably with my inability to not procrastinate, interrupt, lose things, feel so overwhelmed that I avoided everything. Unfortunately, there is a shortage of this med and I've heard that it may be discontinued in favor of a new 'non-abusable' IR d,l-amp product by the pharma corp that makes Zenzedi! And like many medical decisions made in this era, citizens have no ability to change the outcome."""
tail 5,disturbance in attention,"Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine) for ADHD""Great medicine, I recently restarted this medicine after 10 years and I feel normal again. This medicine has given me great peace in my life. I feel calm and collected, and I'm quickly understanding what it's like to have 'free time'. I insist that people who find results using this medicine ensure those in government understand the increase in quality of life we are all experiencing. I've rated this medicine 10/10 purely because any cons I've experienced are meaningless compared to being given a life."""
tail 5,disturbance in attention,"Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine) for ADHD""So I started Zoloft in my 20s, it worked really great for a couple of years. So when I got any depression flare-ups again, I was put on antidepressants, but noticed they weren’t working anymore. I still feel those symptoms: sadness, low self-esteem, no energy to do anything, forgetting things, procrastinating a lot, hard to concentrate and finish a task. I wondered if I had ADD. It all pointed to Adult ADD. I told my doc of my beliefs and maybe I was misdiagnosed. I tried more antidepressants which were having no effect. Then my therapist convinced my doctor to prescribe me Dexedrine 10mg just in the morning. The first day I took my pill, my eyes were open, the energy was there, and I couldn’t believe it worked. Now, on the 3rd day with just one 10mg pill in the morning, it stopped working. In my opinion, I believe a lot of people are misdiagnosed, thinking they have depression instead of ADD or ADHD."""
