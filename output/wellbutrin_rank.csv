top 1,irritability,A lot of times attention is intimately tied with anxiety and depression. Often times even if a doctor suspects that you have ADHD they’ll try anti-depressant/anti-anxiety medication first to see what is the proportion of contributing factors.

top 5,hypotension,"> It's a dopamine re-uptake inhibitor

It's a weak dopamine reuptake inhibitor. For some people with specific liver enzyme issues it doesn't even have DRI properties, but only NRI.

> Adhd Is characterized by dopamine deficits that's why wellbutrin could work. 

ADHD is associated with disruptions in many circuits and different gene variants. Dopamine deficit is not a remotely scientific explanation for this condition."
tail 1,no adverse event,"During the first two weeks there are initial side effects, which are normal. This includes psychological side effects. If the side effects are particularly severe or don't stop after the first two weeks, then I would see a doctor."

tail 1,no adverse event,I personally did not have a great time on it. After the second week I felt “emotional blunting” which is not normal because you normally don’t feel anything until 2 months after.
tail 1,no adverse event,I've been in Wellbutrin for years the only negative side effect I ever had was when I was on 300mg and the side effect was vivid dreams. Other than that literally no negatives.
tail 1,no adverse event,IIRC anti depressants shouldn't be paired with stimulants (especially zoloft and ritalin) due to the increased risk of serotonin syndrome. It's entirely possible that you experienced those side effects because of drug interaction (in addition to it not being suitable for you).

I take brand name Wellbutrin along with my Biphentin (extended release methylphenidate in Canada) and Ritalin IR and I notice a slight prolong ""boost""."
