Started with the name brand but switched to generic due to costs. Generics appear to vary widely. Neither Teva nor Aurobindo work for me at all. Worthless for me. Mallinckrodt works, as does the brand name, but I can't access Mallinckrodt. Someone has suggested Zenzedi (tablet, not capsule). It is a generic-simply named. Anyone have any experience with it? Anyone have a similar experience with Teva or Aurobindo? Either the inactive ingredients are sufficiently different to cause problems for me, or they don't include the same dosage of the active ingredient. Anyone know which? Dexedrine itself has made a huge difference in my life.""",1.8945480585098267

My parents thought it was rubbish due to my grades and voracious reading, and that my typical ADHD (and ASD) traits were me being lazy, immature, bratty, or oversensitive. After two decades of life failure (grades don't predict success), I sought treatment. Only Zenzedi (NOT any of the generic d-amps) helped reliably with my inability to not procrastinate, interrupt, lose things, feel so overwhelmed that I avoided everything. Unfortunately, there is a shortage of this med and I've heard that it may be discontinued in favor of a new 'non-abusable' IR d,l-amp product by the pharma corp that makes Zenzedi!

While Adderall contains dextroamphetamine, the l-amphetamine, and it gives me very bad anxiety. Dextroamphetamine helps me focus without causing extra anxiety, and I prefer the instant release, which allows me to fall asleep. Ritalin caused anxiety even worse than Adderall did. One thing I recommend is to take a day or two off every week or so. If not, your tolerance might build up, and you might find the medication is not working. Also, you need to learn to pay attention to your body's other signals telling you when to eat. You probably will not feel hungry, and your stomach.
