Adderall, which is dextroamp and levoamp, the latter affecting mostly norepinephrine, made me tired and flat--and hungry. Kind of a paradoxical reaction. It helped my emotional overreactivity, but not other ADHD symptoms like initiation of tasks and related anxiety/irritability, procrastination, and negative ruminations (mentally getting 'stuck'). Obviously, my brain needs help with dopamine, and too much norepinephrine is dulling and unpleasantly sedating.

Dextroamphetamine (generic)/Zenzedi (brand name) acts more on dopamine than norepinephrine.

It helped my emotional overreactivity, but not other ADHD symptoms like initiation of tasks and related anxiety/irritability, procrastination, and negative ruminations (mentally getting 'stuck'). Obviously, my brain needs help with dopamine, and too much norepinephrine is dulling and unpleasantly sedating.

dexstrostat,asthenia,"Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine) for ADHD""This medication is hard to find, which is unfortunate because, quite simply, it works on some ADHD people when other more common medications do not. Dextroamphetamine (generic)/Zenzedi (brand name) acts more on dopamine than norepinephrine. Adderall, which is dextroamp and levoamp, the latter affecting mostly norepinephrine, made me tired and flat--and hungry. Kind of a paradoxical reaction. It helped my emotional overreactivity, but not other ADHD symptoms like initiation of tasks and related anxiety/irritability, procrastination, and negative ruminations (mentally getting 'stuck'). Obviously, my brain needs help with dopamine, and too much norepinephrine is dulling and unpleasantly sedating.

The ""Vyvyanse Crash"" is real, in  my experience, as many others have observed.  This often leads to patients continually upping their dosages.  As for ADD and ADHD, it is interesting that both have become epidemics in the U.S., but not in Europe.  I believe this is because in the US of the massive profitability pharmaceutical experience in developing new drugs for every affliction.  That is just my opinion.  Regular exercise and diet are natural ways to address depression, ADD, ADHD and other conditions.  Common sense, but the pharma companies can't profit from it.

The ""Vyvyanse Crash"" is real, in  my experience, as many others have observed.  This often leads to patients continually upping their dosages.  As for ADD and ADHD, it is interesting that both have become epidemics in the U.S., but not in Europe.  I believe this is because in the US of the massive profitability pharmaceutical experience in developing new drugs for every affliction.  That is just my opinion.  Regular exercise and diet are natural ways to address depression, ADD, ADHD and other conditions.  Common sense, but the pharma companies can't profit from it.

It does not make you feel 'drugged' like other medications do. I felt like my old self again, before the days of CFS.""",6.066131412982941
vyvanse,weight decreased,"For Binge Eating Disorder""I take Vyvanse for ADHD and Binge Eating Disorder. I am a recovered drug/alcohol addict (3.5 years) and that 'urge' moved to food. I am SO happy with Vyvanse, and think I'm finally ready to get off my Suboxone soon. This is the closest to 'normal' I have ever felt.""",6.051479995250702
vyvanse,weight decreased,"For Binge Eating Disorder""I started on Vyvanse for BED in Oct. 2018. It gave me lots of energy & loss of appetite & increased my libido! Started on 30 mg & now increased to 70 mg. It's now July 2019 & still on it & was weighing 177 before I started & now weigh 130. Went from size 10 to size 4. I know my dr. will be taking me off of it when I run out. Just hoping my appetite doesn't come back.""",6.033074915409088
vyvanse,weight decreased,"""I started taking Vyvanse sophomore year of high school, and my grades went up, and I actually became a good student. But I went from 142 lbs to 117 lbs. Not a good medicine if you are not okay with losing weight.""",6.027940630912781
vyvanse,weight decreased,"""I take 60 mg of Adderall and had to switch because of the shortage that is happening with Adderall, and Vyvanse made me feel absolutely miserable. 70 mg of Vyvanse put me in a place that I never want to go to ever again!""",6.025036811828613
vyvanse,weight decreased,"For Binge Eating Disorder""I fought BED (binge eating disorder) and purging for 12 years before my PCP told me about Vyvanse. After a few days of taking the medication, all the obsession and thoughts were gone. Wow. Thank you Vyvanse""",6.017135739326477
vyvanse,weight decreased,"""My 11-year-old son was diagnosed with ADHD 2 months ago. He was failing school (all F's but tested at a high school level). After starting Vyvanse, he now has all A's and two B's. It has helped him to concentrate and work to his ability. This new drug has given him his life back. Side effects were mild, and the life effects were out of this world!""",5.99818280339241
vyvanse,weight decreased,"For Binge Eating Disorder""So I started this Vyvanse for my ADD, and I was trying to lose weight at the time too. Once I first started taking it, I saw an improvement. Before meds at all, I was 184 lb, when I first began Vyvanse, I was 150. Four months later, I am 127. I barely have an appetite, but I always do late at night, I guess when it wears off.""",5.994623243808746
vyvanse,weight decreased,"""Addressing the misinformed subscriber who proclaimed, 'Vyvanse is SPEED!', and that its use led to his rapid addiction to speed. This is clinically not possible. Though there is an underlying component of amphetamine in this med, it is moreover a CNS (Central Nervous System Stimulant), as is strattera (which contains a large percentage of norepinephrine in it and may help those battling depression as well as ADD). Guess what else is classified as a CNS - your morning coffee. We all recognize Folgers and Nescafe as unregulated gateway drugs, so shouldn't we get excited about them as some of these 'users and their abuses of caffeine' aside the evils of Vyvanse? Personal responsibility and accountability are key.""",5.994393467903137

kapvay,condition aggravated,"""My 6-year-old son was diagnosed with ADHD last year. I saw signs during the preschool years as he was kicked out of three schools. This has been a trying year as we started him on Concerta, Focalin 2.5, and Focalin ER. Intuniv: Although the stimulants were great and we saw the benefits, it was difficult for me to see the negative side effects (tics and meltdown). I had mentioned to my doctor a month ago about Clonidine to reduce side effects of stimulants. She declined as she was uncomfortable with providing adult medication to children. However, she contacted me about Kapvay, which has been wonderful. Day 6 and a bit sleepy, unlike Intuniv (sedated). I will keep you up to date.""",3.754186987876892

It made him constantly tired and irritable, and actually made his impulsiveness worse since he just seemed cranky and emotional all of the time. It also constipated him to the point that he ended up with fissures. It never made a meaningful dent in his ability to concentrate or sit still, and he became more argumentative in school and less willing to comply. I've yet to meet anyone that these work for, but it sure would be nice if there were a non-stimulant that worked. We're on stimulants now and still haven't found a miracle there, either.

I've spaced the three medications out, but he still wakes up at 9 am and goes to bed at 3 am. I am at a loss right now because the psychiatrist says he's limited as to what he can put him on, but the Trazodone, I swear, seems to wire him up. He's wide awake as I am writing this post.

She is engaged, focused, and less moody. Her emotions are more regulated, and we did not tell her teacher, but she even commented on the change without us sharing the news.

His school performance was no better than before, so we are back to Kapvay. Since the medicine must build up in the bloodstream to be highly effective, we are in the very sleepy stages, but I know this will pass as soon as his body is accustomed to the medicine.

Our new psychiatrist recommended Kapvay, and we were very skeptical, as our son was irritable and even more aggressive with regular clonidine. With Kapvay, there has been a SIGNIFICANT decrease in our son's aggressiveness. He is still very obsessive, rude, and verbally defiant. So physically, we rate Kapvay a TEN in decreasing aggression, but we only rated it a seven due to other factors.
