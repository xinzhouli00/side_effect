concerta,drug ineffective,"54 in the morning. I try to do high protein for the first half of the day, start my day with electrolytes, and sleep at least 7-8 hours. When I sleep less, it really has no effect.",5.935122191905975
concerta,drug ineffective,"It was dark outside. You probably had a crash which can make you anxious. Those most likely were not hallucinations, but your mind playing tricks and jumping to the worst case scenario. Been there done that",5.924280643463135
concerta,drug ineffective,I’m on Wellbutrin and concerta too. I was also taking lamitrigine but I’m going to stop that one - tends to make the crash from concerta if I stay up late much worse,5.917874902486801
concerta,drug ineffective,"""I was diagnosed with mixed-type ADHD at 25, far later than most. I started at 18 mg and have been slowly bumped up to 36 mg. Overall, my working/short-term memory, energy levels, and mood have improved moderately. Unfortunately, I somehow burn through the medication in less than 6 hours and crash halfway through work almost every day. This drug has helped a lot, but it isn't perfect for my brain chemistry.""",5.916610360145569
concerta,drug ineffective,"Sounds more like anxiety. Those are normal blood pressure readings - tho you need to know how to take them & space them apart for accuracy.

When my doctor checks my pulse, it goes high due to my anxiety with doctors. Pulse rates fluctuate and that’s normal. 

You should work on managing stress and anxiety such as with short guided meditations or even eft tapping. These can centre you & help your body find calm again.",5.909775882959366
concerta,drug ineffective,"I started with 54 due to the mg for kg of weight. After about 6 years I chatted with my doctor to lower it. I now do 36 mg on normal work days and 18 mg on “social” work days (e.g. international trips, summits, fridays, etc)",5.90830397605896
concerta,drug ineffective,"Then it can't primarily be the Concerta.  If it were, the chest pain time of day would move, too.

What are you doing earlier in the day, regularly?  Are you having afternoon caffeine?  The conversion to norepinephrine about 5 hours later may very well give you anxiety and chest pain.",5.9048855900764465
concerta,drug ineffective,"Get well hydrated and try again tomorrow.  Methylphenidate is a drug that'll do you dirty if you're not living pretty clean.  You need to stay hydrated, get enough sleep, eat enough protein and get enough exercise.  Not doing those things usually results in more side effects than benefits.

If you haven't already, give up caffeine, nicotine and alcohol.",5.897787481546402
concerta,drug ineffective,"No, side effects. Perhaps bodies adapt to the combo? Living in a wine producing region a glass or two of wine late afternoon/early evening is common. I was not even aware in the beginning that the two should not mix. Perhaps it affected me initially but not anymore. My wife would also quickly comment on it if she noticed my behaviour was unusual or I was getting to tipsy.",5.876388400793076
concerta,drug ineffective,"This is a dangerous overdose and not going to make concerta any more effective. You need sleep. 

Sorry about your psych. I've been there with doctors who just won't listen. But taking 270mg of concerta over a day is not the answer.",5.867762893438339
