top 1,irritability,"""Intuniv worked terribly for me. I was prescribed it for ADHD, and it caused so many issues and fixed absolutely none.

I’m dizzy, I feel like my vision is blacking out when I walk, I’m extremely lethargic, and find myself sleeping all the time. I’ve been having stomach problems, a high heartbeat (and I thought Intuniv was supposed to subdue you), an extremely dry mouth, and so much anxiety. I haven’t even noticed any positive changes in my ability to focus since I’m constantly disoriented or asleep."""

You do have to stay well-hydrated to avoid constipation and low blood pressure. The trade-off in the loss of almost all of her anxiety behaviors and her eagerness to now seek out activities and social interaction outside the house is amazing. We could not have achieved this without the close monitoring of her pediatrician. Our insurance does cover the generic at a very reasonable co-pay."""

top 4,hypotension,"""Five days into starting on Intuniv XR (1 mg daily at bedtime) for mild hypertension, a massive panic attack occurred. I am a 52-year-old male with no prior history of such attacks. I stopped the medication the next day, but it continued at 100% intensity for five days straight. Sweating, shivers, tremors, moaning, racing pulse, hot flashes in face and extremities, tight sternum knot, stabbing pain in left chest. Constant feelings of hopelessness, despair, and suicide. Luckily, by day six it had dropped 50% strength, tapering off quickly at first, then more slowly over the next ten days. Three weeks later I still have palpitations and an inner tremor causing insomnia. The doctor refuses to believe it, but I'm convinced the drug caused the attack."""
