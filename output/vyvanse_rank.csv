top 1,irritability,Might just be dehydration? Even if you're not on meds and dehydrated that alone can cause nausea. Drink a ton of water throughout the day or an electrolyte type drink too.
top 1,irritability,"Agree with everything here but thought I’d add my reactions to Vyvanse. Brand name, 50mg, 4-5hrs duration with terrible crash with extreme vertigo on comedown. Eat high protein lots of water, manual labour for work. 5mg dex booster at 4hr and 7hr mark. Resolved the moodiness and vertigo of my crash."
top 1,irritability,"Came here to say this. Alcohol is a depressant and Vyvanse a Stimulant, basically opposite effects. I haven’t drank on Vyvanse but cocaine? Absolutely. I just never felt the alcohol as much until it was too late. BAC higher than I felt it in reality."

top 2,dizziness,"I don’t particularly like drinking alcohol when medicated, but it’s never been uncomfortable or led to any issues. I usually have a drink every two hours or so when medicated, so 3 drinks over an evening.

Heavy drinking where you drink continuously is another story. Vyvanse will mask the alcohol effect until you’re suddenly stupendously drunk. That’s the danger, not much else."

top 3,dyspnoea,Good for you i went through the mill of anti depressants but also anto psychotic medication for it. When I am badly inattentive 9/9 and 6/9 hyperactive with ADHD i had to wait for meds lisdex. What are you on? And are you feeling better?
