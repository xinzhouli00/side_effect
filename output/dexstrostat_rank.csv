top 1,irritability,"Zenzedi (dextroamphetamine) for ADHD""I'm 37, was diagnosed with ADHD at 9. My parents thought it was rubbish due to my grades and voracious reading, and that my typical ADHD (and ASD) traits were me being lazy, immature, bratty, or oversensitive. After two decades of life failure (grades don't predict success), I sought treatment. Only Zenzedi (NOT any of the generic d-amps) helped reliably with my inability to not procrastinate, interrupt, lose things, feel so overwhelmed that I avoided everything. Unfortunately, there is a shortage of this med and I've heard that it may be discontinued in favor of a new 'non-abusable' IR d,l-amp product by the pharma corp that makes Zenzedi! And like many medical decisions made in this era, citizens have no ability to change the outcome."""

top 1,irritability,"Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine) for ADHD""I have taken pretty much every type of medication for ADHD. Dextroamphetamine, by far, works best for me. While Adderall contains dextroamphetamine, the l-amphetamine, and it gives me very bad anxiety. Dextroamphetamine helps me focus without causing extra anxiety, and I prefer the instant release, which allows me to fall asleep. Ritalin caused anxiety even worse than Adderall did. One thing I recommend is to take a day or two off every week or so. If not, your tolerance might build up, and you might find the medication is not working. Also, you need to learn to pay attention to your body's other signals telling you when to eat. You probably will not feel hungry, and your stomach. This does not mean you don't need food, however."""
top 1,irritability,"Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine) for ADHD""Have been taking Dexedrine spansules (10 mg) for over 2 years, three times per day. I never knew I had rank ADHD all my life - problems with school, the law. I am 47 and have noticed my ambition for life has increased, having more energy. I used to be tired a lot, complaining, generally overall agitated. At the same time, I have many comorbidities to deal with but fortunately don't have to take any anxiety meds.

top 1,irritability,"Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine) for ADHD""Have been on dextroamphetamine for a very long time for ADHD. Started with the name brand but switched to generic due to costs. Generics appear to vary widely. Neither Teva nor Aurobindo work for me at all. Worthless for me. Mallinckrodt works, as does the brand name, but I can't access Mallinckrodt. Someone has suggested Zenzedi (tablet, not capsule). It is a generic-simply named. Anyone have any experience with it? Anyone have a similar experience with Teva or Aurobindo? Either the inactive ingredients are sufficiently different to cause problems for me, or they don't include the same dosage of the active ingredient. Anyone know which? Dexedrine itself has made a huge difference in my life."""

Maybe this is what normal is meant to feel like—a world without yawns and easy distractions? Have I truly found a way to make it through a two-hour movie? I think a new chapter in my life just opened..."""
tail 5,suicide,"Zenzedi (dextroamphetamine) for ADHD""I'm 37, was diagnosed with ADHD at 9. My parents thought it was rubbish due to my grades and voracious reading, and that my typical ADHD (and ASD) traits were me being lazy, immature, bratty, or oversensitive. After two decades of life failure (grades don't predict success), I sought treatment. Only Zenzedi (NOT any of the generic d-amps) helped reliably with my inability to not procrastinate, interrupt, lose things, feel so overwhelmed that I avoided everything. Unfortunately, there is a shortage of this med and I've heard that it may be discontinued in favor of a new 'non-abusable' IR d,l-amp product by the pharma corp that makes Zenzedi! And like many medical decisions made in this era, citizens have no ability to change the outcome."""
tail 5,suicide,"Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine) for ADHD""Have been taking Dexedrine spansules (10 mg) for over 2 years, three times per day. I never knew I had rank ADHD all my life - problems with school, the law. I am 47 and have noticed my ambition for life has increased, having more energy. I used to be tired a lot, complaining, generally overall agitated. At the same time, I have many comorbidities to deal with but fortunately don't have to take any anxiety meds. Dexedrine is all I know, and I am satisfied with the results."""
tail 5,suicide,"Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine) for ADHD""Adderall 30mg/day = you feel like a genius, work hard, EYES OPEN WIDE. But at the end of the work day, I still couldn't stop myself from falling asleep on the skytrain at around 4:30 pm when I try to read. Don't think it helped much with depression and anxiety. Dexedrine 3 10mg/day = You have tunnel vision, Focused, block out distractions, helps with my severe anxiety. I think the depression is pretty under control too. Can read all day if I want. Could have really used this when I began my studies, 4 years ago! Not a month ago, with one course.... Either one, I think you perform better at work and school, but Adderall just wore off, so studying after work, you would still need coffee, or a power nap"""
tail 5,suicide,"Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine) for ADHD""I have taken pretty much every type of medication for ADHD. Dextroamphetamine, by far, works best for me. While Adderall contains dextroamphetamine, the l-amphetamine, and it gives me very bad anxiety. Dextroamphetamine helps me focus without causing extra anxiety, and I prefer the instant release, which allows me to fall asleep. Ritalin caused anxiety even worse than Adderall did. One thing I recommend is to take a day or two off every week or so. If not, your tolerance might build up, and you might find the medication is not working. Also, you need to learn to pay attention to your body's other signals telling you when to eat. You probably will not feel hungry, and your stomach. This does not mean you don't need food, however."""
