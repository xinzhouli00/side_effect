top 1,irritability,"""I started my son on this medicine on Friday. He is doing well. No emotional breakdowns, no crying. The only issue I am having is he is falling asleep around noon every day. He hasn't had a nap since he was 16 months old. He is 7, going on 8. I can't imagine his teacher will be all that amused when he goes to sleep during class tomorrow."""
top 1,irritability,"""I'm a 44-year-old female, was in a car accident. Placed on pain meds for the last year. Had two surgeries, and now I ask the doctor to help me get off pain meds. He prescribed me Kapvay 0.01 mg. It has been a Godsend. It allowed me to sleep and took the edge off my withdrawals... thanks."""
top 1,irritability,"""My 8-year-old son has been on various stimulants, in addition to regular clonidine, Intuniv, Risperdal, Seroquel, Strattera, and Abilify. My son is extremely impulsive and aggressive towards our family on a daily basis, and I had been thinking that nothing would help our son. Our new psychiatrist recommended Kapvay, and we were very skeptical, as our son was irritable and even more aggressive with regular clonidine. With Kapvay, there has been a SIGNIFICANT decrease in our son's aggressiveness. He is still very obsessive, rude, and verbally defiant. So physically, we rate Kapvay a TEN in decreasing aggression, but we only rated it a seven due to other factors. It is the ONLY medicine that has helped reduce physical aggression for our son."""
top 1,irritability,"""My 6-year-old tried this after Intuniv failed. It made him constantly tired and irritable, and actually made his impulsiveness worse since he just seemed cranky and emotional all of the time. It also constipated him to the point that he ended up with fissures. It never made a meaningful dent in his ability to concentrate or sit still, and he became more argumentative in school and less willing to comply. I've yet to meet anyone that these work for, but it sure would be nice if there were a non-stimulant that worked. We're on stimulants now and still haven't found a miracle there, either. I will say that it didn't affect his appetite, which was nice."""

top 2,dizziness,"""My son is 6 years old and was diagnosed with ADHD, ODD, Asperger's syndrome, and possible bipolar disorder. We have tried so many medications: Ritalin, Adderall, Focalin XR, Risperdal, Seroquel, and regular Clonidine. He is now taking 300 mg of Trazodone, which doesn't help, 15 mg of Abilify, and Kapvay. I've spaced the three medications out, but he still wakes up at 9 am and goes to bed at 3 am. I am at a loss right now because the psychiatrist says he's limited as to what he can put him on, but the Trazodone, I swear, seems to wire him up. He's wide awake as I am writing this post. The Kapvay does make him cranky and irritable during the afternoon. Any advice, please."""
