top 1,irritability,"Very often if you keep taking the medication, the sexual dysfunction goes away after a few weeks. Like a month. Like my libido isn’t completely dead, just greatly diminished because I’m on a high dose."
top 1,irritability,Did you also have anxiety? Has it helped for that? Have you tried stimulants? I feel like my anxiety and ocd get way worse when the stimulants wear off in the evening.
top 1,irritability,"Is there any deaths related to this side effect of Strattera or is it recommended to people who have heart disease or who have high blood pressure? It’s crazy how a non-stimulant raises your heart rate, yet stimulant raises it even most which is even more scary for young children and adults."
top 1,irritability,"I hope you've spent at least 3 weeks on 40mg before you decide to increase. Either way, my ADHD symptoms exacerbate when leaping up a dose. But no one can say exactly what you'll experience."

top 2,dizziness,"I have extreme muscle spasms if I lose my pill in the morning. In a days before I crushed porcelain cup in my palm. 9 month, 60 mg. 

As for my first day sides, that was constant ED, tremor, 110+ bpm, emotional numbness and apathy, also with extreme drowsiness. It was way easier on week 2, all of them have gone in 3 month"

tail 1,no adverse event,"I’m having a very similar experience. Is there any concern that if we ever go off of it, our bodies will be in shock or need to readjust to pre-straterra levels? If so- is that a painful withdrawal/tapering period?"

tail 1,no adverse event,The adjustment period can be rough even on low dose. I say stick to it for at least 2 months (I'm no doctor). Then decide. There was light at the end of the tunnel for me. But everyone chemistry is so different.

tail 4,suicide,"Ideally, you should start at 40mg. Maybe you'd be able to tolerate 60mg because every body is different, but maybe that's not a good idea before working, especially with the job you have. 

It's your call."

tail 4,suicide,Mine went up to around 85-90 bpm from low 80s but then dropped to high 60s/low 70s after I lost weight. I bet if I went off I would go down to low 60s.
