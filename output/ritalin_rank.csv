top 1,irritability,"For me, it's lowered my Blood pressure and pulse. So for some people who it does that to, and takes away the stress and anxiety, it probably actually lengthens life span."
top 1,irritability,"Thanks for this comment! How do you deal with feeling emotionally numbed, less able to laugh and more agitated at things in general? I really struggle with that even at homeopathically low doses"
top 1,irritability,"For people who are struggling with fatigue—try mouth taping at night and see how you feel. Obviously don’t rule out other situations, but sleep disorders are very comorbid with ADHD. There is no healthy snoring. It is not good for you. I have seen a huge difference in how restorative my sleep is due to this."
top 1,irritability,"I understand, but I am not jazzed about long term health side effects of stimulant usage, and I want to minimize the effects. Also, I have trouble sleeping at higher dosages. Everyone's body chemistry is just a little different."

top 2,dizziness,"""Many people experience a rebound phase when their Ritalin wears off. In that time symptoms may be heightened. I personally find that very annoying, but it's rather normal. In that time I have troubles with making decision, forming complete and grammatically correct sentences etc."" 


Thank you!! 
Experienced exactly this yesterday and wondered. Just starting meds."
top 2,dizziness,Is he taking it after a meal. If I take meds before the peak dose is way to high and the side effects wreck me. Fats slow the digestion of some adhd medication.

top 3,dyspnoea,I had a similar affect! I had unusually low blood pressure but a high heart rate. Now my blood pressure is normal and my heart rate has decreased. Very bizarre but relieving! Also on adderall xr & ir
top 3,dyspnoea,My mom was diagnosed with Parkinson's and my psych took me off methylphenidate completely. He says it will bring on symptoms of Parkinson's much earlier. It's killing me - I'm really struggling without it.

Not a case study, but supports what the neurologist was telling my father in law.

Moral of the story, take the physical health of your brain seriously and have a discussion with your doctor about any concerns. Otherwise you could be at risk for longer term affects."
top 4,application site erythema,Strattera takes a long time to work (months and months) and the preferred dose is 80mg.  It’s a weird drug.  Wellbutrin is also reported to work.  So you’re not out of options.

tail 1,no adverse event,It can reduce long term tolerance. I can stand 1 day a week of being dysfunctional idiot in order to not have to escalate my dosage in a few months and risk potential side effects. My doctor agrees with me.
tail 1,no adverse event,">an executive functioning disorder that my doctors treat with stimulants

This ^ should be the official term. Wouldn't surprise me people on this thread will use it in the future. No more direct stigma."
tail 1,no adverse event,"""I found Ritalin increased my alertness and concentration. I rate Ritalin 2/10 as I find it increased my depression, from which point I stopped taking it. Unsure whether the Ritalin interacted negatively with my usual small dose antidepressant Cymbalta or if increased depression is an unreported side effect."""
tail 1,no adverse event,"I was diagnosed with severe adhd and it is absolutely debilitating. Not to mention the other co-morbid conditions I have such as anxiety, depression, and dyspraxia. I hate it when social media portrays adhd as this cute quirky trait that just happens to be in style."
tail 1,no adverse event,"Also, there is an increase in workplace accidents and car accidents among ADHD people. I feel borderline disabled sometimes. Hearing people say ""ADHD is my superpower"" and generally trivialising the severity of the disorder is beyond cringy. It's infuriating."

tail 2,condition aggravated,"Wellbutrin changed my life. Treated the results of my undiagnosed ADHD (depression, lethargy, some motivation) and got me going. Though I do think it's not as effective as stimulants purely for ADHD symptoms."
tail 2,condition aggravated,"Can you elaborate, because this seems like you are suggesting that ADHD is a behavioral problem caused by economic and social pressures. 

For some of us, medication is the only thing that works."

tail 2,condition aggravated,"Quality of day-to-day life is at the very foundation of treating any disorder. What's more, you can combine small doses of stimulants with non-stimulant treatments like SNRIs such as Straterra. Her argument for why you don't need the medication for your diagnosed condition is not only wrong, it's irresponsible."

tail 4,suicide,Life is hard when you’re functioning properly. When your brain is working in fast forward mode all the time some shit gets neglected and opportunities pass you by. So yeah I wish I was medicated 20 years earlier.
tail 4,suicide,"I hate the ""no chemicals"" crowd. It's never science based. Everything in your life is a chemical. Water is a chemical. Cooking is a chemical reaction. Your dad is being ignorant, don't let him get in your head."

tail 5,pain,"The appetite aspect of it, you will have 0 hunger cues on ritalin until it wears off at night, if you rely on hunger cues it's very easy to lose way too much weight way too fast so it's important to force yourself to eat."
