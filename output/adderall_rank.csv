top 5,hypotension,"So, this was a question I had pondered for a long time. Why is it that Adderall and other drugs for that matter lose effect over time. And, how certain dietary changes can cause profound changes in the therapeutic effect experienced. 

The following study helps explain why a person with ADHD new to Adderall might not feel any effect and a person who has no cognitive issue might have an overwhelming effect. 

In the link below, blood serum pH (acidity or basicness) and the lower the pH the weaker the effect. This is why Tums potentiates Adderall, but if you raised the pH of the entire body the same dose might be hell and cause unpleasant things like tachycardia.

tail 2,condition aggravated,"""Since being switched to the generic version of Adderall, Dextroamp-Amphetamine manufactured by Alvogen, I have been experiencing negative side effects for the past three days. I have become irritable, emotional, and easily agitated by noises, including music that I previously enjoyed. I have also been experiencing fatigue, lack of motivation, and difficulty reading. My speech has become slurred and confused, and I have developed tension headaches. I want my sparkle back, and I couldn't care less about anything. I’m surprised I’m writing this review as I am currently feeling scattered and embarrassed."""
