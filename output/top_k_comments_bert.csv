It's a very strong stimulant, so it does have temporary side effects. Most will go away in two to four weeks, like euphoria, anxiety, and teeth grinding, but the dry mouth and insomnia if taken late will not subside for months.

dexstrostat,drug ineffective,"Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine) for ADHD""So I started Zoloft in my 20s, it worked really great for a couple of years. So when I got any depression flare-ups again, I was put on antidepressants, but noticed they weren’t working anymore. I still feel those symptoms: sadness, low self-esteem, no energy to do anything, forgetting things, procrastinating a lot, hard to concentrate and finish a task. I wondered if I had ADD. It all pointed to Adult ADD. I told my doc of my beliefs and maybe I was misdiagnosed. I tried more antidepressants which were having no effect. Then my therapist convinced my doctor to prescribe me Dexedrine 10mg just in the morning. The first day I took my pill, my eyes were open, the energy was there, and I couldn’t believe it worked. Now, on the 3rd day with just one 10mg pill in the morning, it stopped working.

Obviously, my brain needs help with dopamine, and too much norepinephrine is dulling and unpleasantly sedating.

Out of 36 vials, one did not work and made me feel miserable, and the only one was Teva. The odds (0.028) are too long for coincidence or expectancy effect. There's something wrong with the 5/10 mg tablets of Teva's Dexedrine. Teva is tainted or there's some other problem with it. Avoid!""",0.2696695029735565

It helped my emotional overreactivity, but not other ADHD symptoms like initiation of tasks and related anxiety/irritability, procrastination, and negative ruminations (mentally getting 'stuck'). Obviously, my brain needs help with dopamine, and too much norepinephrine is dulling and unpleasantly sedating.

I still feel those symptoms: sadness, low self-esteem, no energy to do anything, forgetting things, procrastinating a lot, hard to concentrate and finish a task. I wondered if I had ADD. It all pointed to Adult ADD. I told my doc of my beliefs and maybe I was misdiagnosed. I tried more antidepressants which were having no effect. Then my therapist convinced my doctor to prescribe me Dexedrine 10mg just in the morning. The first day I took my pill, my eyes were open, the energy was there, and I couldn’t believe it worked. Now, on the 3rd day with just one 10mg pill in the morning, it stopped working. In my opinion, I believe a lot of people are misdiagnosed, thinking they have depression instead of ADD or ADHD.""",0.4377848207950592

dexstrostat,diarrhoea,"Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine) for ADHD""This medication is hard to find, which is unfortunate because, quite simply, it works on some ADHD people when other more common medications do not. Dextroamphetamine (generic)/Zenzedi (brand name) acts more on dopamine than norepinephrine. Adderall, which is dextroamp and levoamp, the latter affecting mostly norepinephrine, made me tired and flat--and hungry. Kind of a paradoxical reaction. It helped my emotional overreactivity, but not other ADHD symptoms like initiation of tasks and related anxiety/irritability, procrastination, and negative ruminations (mentally getting 'stuck'). Obviously, my brain needs help with dopamine, and too much norepinephrine is dulling and unpleasantly sedating. Those with similar reactions to Adderall (and/or methylphenidates like Ritalin) might want to give Dextroamphetamine a try. It feels like a totally different class of medication than Adderall to my (admittedly atypical) brain, and works great.""",0.8668932318687439

I still feel those symptoms: sadness, low self-esteem, no energy to do anything, forgetting things, procrastinating a lot, hard to concentrate and finish a task. I wondered if I had ADD. It all pointed to Adult ADD. I told my doc of my beliefs and maybe I was misdiagnosed. I tried more antidepressants which were having no effect. Then my therapist convinced my doctor to prescribe me Dexedrine 10mg just in the morning. The first day I took my pill, my eyes were open, the energy was there, and I couldn’t believe it worked.

One thing I recommend is to take a day or two off every week or so. If not, your tolerance might build up, and you might find the medication is not working.

Someone has suggested Zenzedi (tablet, not capsule). It is a generic-simply named. Anyone have any experience with it? Anyone have a similar experience with Teva or Aurobindo?

This month, it was again not working, making me feel miserable and not controlling symptoms. The manufacturer was not on the bottle, so I called the pharmacy. Yup, Teva! I've had more than 36 bottles of Dexedrine since the previous negative experience; none were Teva and all worked. Out of 36 vials, one did not work and made me feel miserable, and the only one was Teva. The odds (0.028) are too long for coincidence or expectancy effect.

dexstrostat,asthenia,"Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine) for ADHD""This medication is hard to find, which is unfortunate because, quite simply, it works on some ADHD people when other more common medications do not. Dextroamphetamine (generic)/Zenzedi (brand name) acts more on dopamine than norepinephrine. Adderall, which is dextroamp and levoamp, the latter affecting mostly norepinephrine, made me tired and flat--and hungry. Kind of a paradoxical reaction. It helped my emotional overreactivity, but not other ADHD symptoms like initiation of tasks and related anxiety/irritability, procrastination, and negative ruminations (mentally getting 'stuck'). Obviously, my brain needs help with dopamine, and too much norepinephrine is dulling and unpleasantly sedating. Those with similar reactions to Adderall (and/or methylphenidates like Ritalin) might want to give Dextroamphetamine a try. It feels like a totally different class of medication than Adderall to my (admittedly atypical) brain, and works great.""",0.408875972032547

Stopping the medication after having taken it daily for over twenty-five years was simple. No withdrawal. Zero. I slept a little more initially. That is all. True ADD is a tragedy. It robs people of their potential, leaving them shadows of what they could be. Don’t give up on yourself.

Dextroamphetamine (generic)/Zenzedi (brand name) acts more on dopamine than norepinephrine. Adderall, which is dextroamp and levoamp, the latter affecting mostly norepinephrine, made me tired and flat--and hungry. Kind of a paradoxical reaction. It helped my emotional overreactivity, but not other ADHD symptoms like initiation of tasks and related anxiety/irritability, procrastination, and negative ruminations (mentally getting 'stuck'). Obviously, my brain needs help with dopamine, and too much norepinephrine is dulling and unpleasantly sedating. Those with similar reactions to Adderall (and/or methylphenidates like Ritalin) might want to give Dextroamphetamine a try.

Dextroamphetamine (generic)/Zenzedi (brand name) acts more on dopamine than norepinephrine. Adderall, which is dextroamp and levoamp, the latter affecting mostly norepinephrine, made me tired and flat--and hungry. Kind of a paradoxical reaction. It helped my emotional overreactivity, but not other ADHD symptoms like initiation of tasks and related anxiety/irritability, procrastination, and negative ruminations (mentally getting 'stuck'). Obviously, my brain needs help with dopamine, and too much norepinephrine is dulling and unpleasantly sedating. Those with similar reactions to Adderall (and/or methylphenidates like Ritalin) might want to give Dextroamphetamine a try.

My dose is 60mg, and it improves my focus for several hours without a sense of agitation. It also seems to calm my mind and allows me to do one thing at a time. As an academic, I have found that to be particularly beneficial when reading long texts. While I appreciate the relief Vyvanse can bring, I need to reiterate that no single pill is going to offer an immediate fix for any mental health condition. Especially with ADHD, sleep and regular exercise are paramount. Over the last two years, I have realized that stimulants simply won't work for me if I am not well-rested, which I believe is the case for most people.

I had suffered from undiagnosed binge eating disorder (BED) as well as PTSD (stemming from sexual abuse) since I was a child. My psychiatrist suggested Vyvanse 40mg for the binge eating (also for mild adult ADHD). I figured that because this is a stimulant, I would have panic attacks; WRONG. I have energy and the desire to accomplish goals again. I no longer obsess over food. I no longer feel addicted to sweets/carbs/horrible foods I used to binge on. I no longer binge eat in general, which allows me to be in a calorie deficit and therefore LOSE WEIGHT. I have been taking this medication since 3/20 and am down 15 lbs today on 4/10.

I lost approximately 47 lbs. Over the past 3.5 months, I have lost another 31 lbs. It controls my impulses to eat when I'm not hungry. I didn't need to follow a special diet to lose any weight.

I would notice health problems (irregular heartbeat, issues with my teeth, etc.), get scared, and stop for a month or two, but would fall right back into it. It was consuming my life. On top of everything else, I was having major issues focusing, which was affecting my work, causing me stress, which led me to eat/purge. I finally spoke to my doctor, and she believed that I had ADHD, and my BED was linked to this. I was given Vyvanse to try. The first day I took it, I felt like a new person. I had energy, drive, focus. I actually worked so hard that day on my laptop that I almost forgot to eat! The obsession was gone. I was now feeding myself to nourish myself. I was so skeptical that anything could help me, but this has changed my life. I’m 8 months in now, and I feel the healthiest I have ever felt.

I gained 100 lb in a year and finally decided to try Vyvanse to curb the habit. I don’t think I’ll ever look back. I don’t get the jitters, nausea, and crashes that I did before, so don’t necessarily let negative experiences with stimulants deter you. I can still eat, but I can’t binge at all. Even if I am very stressed or bored and I emotionally feel like I want a binge, it’s almost like Vyvanse is blocking my consciousness from entering that state. With active habits and healthy eating, I have lost all that weight in just under half a year. I feel like I finally have control over my mind and my body, and nothing has felt so liberating. Note: if you have high BP or are very prone to anxiety, this may not be your favorite.

I would drink alcohol to the point where I passed out because I couldn't sleep otherwise, and eventually became an opiate addict because it would actually take the edge off. I know that is not probably a very common result but it is not unheard of. I felt like I was not in control of myself. Heart rate and blood pressure goes up, weight goes down.

vyvanse,acute kidney injury,"For Binge Eating Disorder""Vyvanse has been great for a near life-long binge eater. I had suffered from undiagnosed binge eating disorder (BED) as well as PTSD (stemming from sexual abuse) since I was a child. My psychiatrist suggested Vyvanse 40mg for the binge eating (also for mild adult ADHD). I figured that because this is a stimulant, I would have panic attacks; WRONG. I have energy and the desire to accomplish goals again. I no longer obsess over food. I no longer feel addicted to sweets/carbs/horrible foods I used to binge on. I no longer binge eat in general, which allows me to be in a calorie deficit and therefore LOSE WEIGHT. I have been taking this medication since 3/20 and am down 15 lbs today on 4/10.

Also, I can't 'feel' when it starts working and stops working - which is great. It wears off slowly starting about 7-8 hours after I take it. After 10-11 hours I do not feel it in my system anymore. No insomnia or 'crashing feeling'. Weight loss (okay since I am fat) about 25 lbs in 3 months. My only complaint is it makes me want to smoke. I quit smoking a long time ago.

Take it too late, I'm wired and unable to sleep. It is trial and error to find the right dose AND right timing. For me, it's 9-10 AM at 40 mg. I don't take it every day. I go without it for weeks, and if I have a binge cycle - not one bad day, but a few in a row - I go back on for a few days until I get my eating under control. Side effects - moving my tongue at higher doses. I drink a lot of water, and it does 'stimulate' my GI tract. My provider said drinking OJ or grapefruit juice will flush from your system more quickly if you can't sleep. It's a tool to help manage BED, but you still need to do the behavioral modifications.

At first, I noticed an increase in mental clarity and physical energy. After a few days, I noticed the medication made me feel negative in the afternoons but nothing severe. When I told my psychiatrist, she put me on 50 mg, which I’ve been on for a month. The pros of the medication are basically nonexistent now, it made me feel so down and negative.

Vyvanse is basically a legal amphetamine and the body takes time to react to it and eventually builds tolerance to it.  The ""Vyvyanse Crash"" is real, in  my experience, as many others have observed.  This often leads to patients continually upping their dosages.  As for ADD and ADHD, it is interesting that both have become epidemics in the U.S., but not in Europe.  I believe this is because in the US of the massive profitability pharmaceutical experience in developing new drugs for every affliction.  That is just my opinion.  Regular exercise and diet are natural ways to address depression, ADD, ADHD and other conditions.  Common sense, but the pharma companies can't profit from it.

I had suffered from undiagnosed binge eating disorder (BED) as well as PTSD (stemming from sexual abuse) since I was a child. My psychiatrist suggested Vyvanse 40mg for the binge eating (also for mild adult ADHD). I figured that because this is a stimulant, I would have panic attacks; WRONG. I have energy and the desire to accomplish goals again. I no longer obsess over food. I no longer feel addicted to sweets/carbs/horrible foods I used to binge on. I no longer binge eat in general, which allows me to be in a calorie deficit and therefore LOSE WEIGHT. I have been taking this medication since 3/20 and am down 15 lbs today on 4/10.

The ""Vyvyanse Crash"" is real, in  my experience, as many others have observed.  This often leads to patients continually upping their dosages.  As for ADD and ADHD, it is interesting that both have become epidemics in the U.S., but not in Europe.  I believe this is because in the US of the massive profitability pharmaceutical experience in developing new drugs for every affliction.  That is just my opinion.  Regular exercise and diet are natural ways to address depression, ADD, ADHD and other conditions.  Common sense, but the pharma companies can't profit from it.

Atomoxetine had similar effects: sleepy, nasal stuffiness, premature ejaculation (only ejaculation was premature). Intuniv actually reversed nasal dryness, my nose never felt better. Intuniv has both stimulating and calming effects, and my mood generally is better. I have more frequent urination at night, I often have to get up at 5 a.m. to go to the bathroom. Sometimes it is hard to get back to sleep, but then usually instant-release Clonidine helps (Clonidine has helped for problems with insomnia). I have NOT had any problems with sexual side effects on Intuniv, which is great. Perhaps only a slight increase in libido, but it could be due to improvement in mood as well.

I eventually settled on 4mg/day. I am WAY more 'chill' these days, yet still very much me. I just feel more level headed.

kapvay,condition aggravated,"""We have an 8-year-old who we adopted from foster care last year. He was diagnosed with ADHD soon after. He was put on Concerta. We saw definite improvement. But early this year, he started exhibiting increased symptoms of ADHD. He could not fall asleep until late, so we used Melatonin. His doctor started him on Kapvay about 5 weeks ago. We started seeing a great improvement the first week because he fell asleep without Melatonin and started getting 10 hours of sleep. The second week, we added the morning dose. Mornings immediately became incredible. We no longer needed checklists for him. The teacher said he still needed better focus, so he is now on 0.3mg. He is doing incredibly well. His doctor is going to wean him down on Concerta.""",0.6426629722118378
kapvay,condition aggravated,"""My son was diagnosed with ADHD in 1st grade. He's now in 6th. We've tried so many meds... Concerta, Intuniv, Focalin, Metasomethingoranother, and more. The stimulants caused massive mood swings. And the other stuff just didn't work well either. He's now on Kapvay, the generic form of it, and so far, so good. He takes 0.1 mg in the morning, and we just increased the evening to 0.2 mg. The only trouble we've had is sleep. He falls asleep but wakes up by 4 a.m. And then, doesn't fall back to sleep until 6 but has to be awake by 7:30. So, right now, he's texting me to bring him coffee. Not sure what to do about the lack of sleep, but I'm really happy with how he's responding otherwise. The mood swings have lessened. Now they just seem tween-typical.""",0.6408388018608093
kapvay,condition aggravated,"""I have an 8-year-old son with ADHD. He is extremely hyper and unable to focus. School and friends became a true nightmare. We see a wonderful and highly respected psychiatrist who is very knowledgeable on ADHD medicines. I was told that when there is an emotional factor to the ADHD, Clonidine is the best medication for this. We tried Clonidine after MANY stimulants and non-stimulants, also antipsychotics. Clonidine 1.0 mg 2x a day was the only medicine that we saw immediate results with. The only side effect was tiredness, which did go away. I started him on Kapvay 2 weeks ago. This medicine is a true GODSEND. He is calm, focused, and far less emotional. We can't say enough great things. Please give this medicine a try.""",0.6321674585342407

kapvay,weight decreased,"""My 7-year-old daughter has been on Concerta 18mg for a year. She started to tolerate that medicine, but I did not want to increase the dosage. My doctor recommended we add Kapvay to her current Concerta dose. This has made all the difference. She is no longer bouncing off the walls, jumping on the couch, or leaving halfway through a meal. She is engaged, focused, and less moody. Her emotions are more regulated, and we did not tell her teacher, but she even commented on the change without us sharing the news. We are so happy, and this medicine is worth the time it takes to condition to the sleepiness that happens in the initial 2 weeks. Hope the changes stay.""",1.6353703141212463

She is almost 10 but small, she weighs 47 pounds (she was a 2.8 lb preemie-11 weeks early). Have to stop medicine. I also read that it was not a great choice for ADD alone.""",1.6249687671661377

It made him constantly tired and irritable, and actually made his impulsiveness worse since he just seemed cranky and emotional all of the time. It also constipated him to the point that he ended up with fissures. It never made a meaningful dent in his ability to concentrate or sit still, and he became more argumentative in school and less willing to comply. I've yet to meet anyone that these work for, but it sure would be nice if there were a non-stimulant that worked. We're on stimulants now and still haven't found a miracle there, either. I will say that it didn't affect his appetite, which was nice.""",1.5807755887508392

We started w/ Intuiv, which dropped his bp way too low (75/43) so stopped after 2 wks.  Tried Clonidine IR and it worked GREAT the 1st 2 days, then fine (not great, just fine).  The doc changed to Kapvay for long-acting effects, but we stopped after 2 wks because he got awful insomnia (took 2-3 hrs to fall asleep instead of his usual 15 mins).  Last night we went back to Clonidine IR - he fell asleep quickly and slept great!  I give Kapvay a 2 because it decreased his impulsivity a bit, but the insomnia was awful, he got more aggressive/emotional, and really affected him negatively.""",1.5544878244400024

He has been on this medicine for nearly one year. We switched to Focalin last month, but the tics came back and the restlessness at night. His school performance was no better than before, so we are back to Kapvay. Since the medicine must build up in the bloodstream to be highly effective, we are in the very sleepy stages, but I know this will pass as soon as his body is accustomed to the medicine. I have learned my lesson. There is no stimulant that will help my son. Kapvay will help reduce the impulsivity, but improvement to concentration must come from age and proper training.""",1.5404041707515717
