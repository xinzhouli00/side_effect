What are you doing earlier in the day, regularly?  Are you having afternoon caffeine?  The conversion to norepinephrine about 5 hours later may very well give you anxiety and chest pain."

Also other parts of the nervous system make changes as serotonin, gaba, glutamate, dopamine.... So of course weed cause physical dependence and psychological too. Other thing is that dependence is lower when compared to other substances as nicotine or opioid but it is real and exist."

When my doctor checks my pulse, it goes high due to my anxiety with doctors. Pulse rates fluctuate and that’s normal. 

You should work on managing stress and anxiety such as with short guided meditations or even eft tapping. These can centre you & help your body find calm again."

top 2,dizziness,"""I was diagnosed with mixed-type ADHD at 25, far later than most. I started at 18 mg and have been slowly bumped up to 36 mg. Overall, my working/short-term memory, energy levels, and mood have improved moderately. Unfortunately, I somehow burn through the medication in less than 6 hours and crash halfway through work almost every day. This drug has helped a lot, but it isn't perfect for my brain chemistry."""

tail 1,no adverse event,This is really interesting. I\`m on 54mg for the last 2 months. It had great effects initially but recently it\`s not as good as before. Though my sleep schedule was horrible this last month. Didn\`t know it can have an effect. Do you know if this is common with others as well?

tail 1,no adverse event,I’m on 36 mg and I’m not sure if this is the crash you are referring to but my first week of taking it I had extreme headaches around the 10-12 hour period after taking the medication. Also my appetite would come back but not as intense when I first started on a lower dose
tail 1,no adverse event,"""I am on 27 mg Concerta. Never felt better. I have better grades because of better concentration. No anxiety or suicidal thoughts. I guess I have too much to keep me alive, that I have never had those thoughts. The only side effect seems to be slight insomnia, but I would prefer better grades over sleep."""

tail 2,condition aggravated,"Yes. My wife says I have verbal diarrhoea sometimes. I am more confidant expressing myself and sharing my opinions . And the anxiety symptom of rethinking everything I might have said is almost gone. Mostly I believe it is a positive effect , but sometimes I can border maybe on arrogant or being to forceful. And after 2 beers multiply the above time two. 😂"
