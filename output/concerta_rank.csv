top 1,drug ineffective,"54 in the morning. I try to do high protein for the first half of the day, start my day with electrolytes, and sleep at least 7-8 hours. When I sleep less, it really has no effect."
top 1,drug ineffective,"It was dark outside. You probably had a crash which can make you anxious. Those most likely were not hallucinations, but your mind playing tricks and jumping to the worst case scenario. Been there done that"
top 1,drug ineffective,I’m on Wellbutrin and concerta too. I was also taking lamitrigine but I’m going to stop that one - tends to make the crash from concerta if I stay up late much worse
top 1,drug ineffective,"""I was diagnosed with mixed-type ADHD at 25, far later than most. I started at 18 mg and have been slowly bumped up to 36 mg. Overall, my working/short-term memory, energy levels, and mood have improved moderately. Unfortunately, I somehow burn through the medication in less than 6 hours and crash halfway through work almost every day. This drug has helped a lot, but it isn't perfect for my brain chemistry."""
top 1,drug ineffective,"Sounds more like anxiety. Those are normal blood pressure readings - tho you need to know how to take them & space them apart for accuracy.

When my doctor checks my pulse, it goes high due to my anxiety with doctors. Pulse rates fluctuate and that’s normal. 

You should work on managing stress and anxiety such as with short guided meditations or even eft tapping. These can centre you & help your body find calm again."
