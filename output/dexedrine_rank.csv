top 1,irritability,"In my case, I developed anxiety as a coping/masking mechanism for my ADHD prior to diagnosis. 

After medication, I have a healthy level of anxiety and am waaay less uptight and rigid. It's wild."
top 1,irritability,"Man I was on starters and it was crazy - narcolepsy, nausea, incontinence, erectile dysfunction, headache, extreme irritability, the works. It was not worth it. I’m seeing my doc tomorrow for a change because it’s just too much

top 1,irritability,"Is your hr 60 during actual rest (e.g. sleep) or during something like office work? 

A jump from 60 to 100 is somewhat severe, even for Adderall. I guess no harm in trying dextroamphetamine."
top 1,irritability,I've been prescribed clonidine (but only the IR version) for insomnia. It's the only medication I've ever taken (including a bunch of antidepressants) that caused erectile dysfunction the next day - does Intuniv also have that risk?
top 1,irritability,"80mg atomoxetine and 15mg methylphenidate.Before i was at 40 mg methylphenidate but it gave me too much anxiety and tachycardia. For now, the new medication works. Although my biggest problems are executive dysfunction and controlling my impulsivity."

top 2,dizziness,"For Narcolepsy""Helps a great deal with daytime sleepiness, which I had all my adult life until Dexedrine. No side effects at 5 to 7.5 mg a day. At 10 mg sometimes anxiety or tension, but not always. No rebound effect or depression if I stop taking it. Not the dangerous drug some people would have you think."""

top 2,dizziness,"Are you taking your blood pressure, and monitoring your pulse? Low, and high blood pressure can make you dizzy. Once I was prescribed the right combo of meds I actually saw a reduction of heart rate and blood pressure. My doctor says that it’s likely due to a reduction in anxiety because I can function now. 

Dehydration will also contribute to low BP. Make sure you are getting a sufficient supply of electrolytes (what plants crave) as well."

tail 1,no adverse event,"The difference is there has been a nationwide shortage of Adderall, and methylphenidate based stimulants being monitored by the FDA since October 2022, while the shortage of Vyvanse you and others here are experiencing is local to the poster.

Which is indicative of a failing of your local pharmacy supply chain."

tail 2,condition aggravated,"Adderall in particular can cause dehydration quite easily throughout the day. Dehydration alone can lead to irritability, headaches, etc. all things that are common during comedowns from adderall anyways, but it's gonna hit way harder if you're also dehyhdrated."
tail 2,condition aggravated,"It's also false that people who have ADHD don't get a pleasurable feeling from stimulants. Its just the way the brain works when it gets a massive boost of dopamine, neuropephrine, and serotonin."
tail 2,condition aggravated,"Levo has some benefits. Mostly I think it causes anxiety which people confuse with motivation. But it does seem to have a synergistic effect. 

I wonder when they'll release a 7:1 dextro:levo formulation. Meanwhile compound pharmacies are shaking their heads."

tail 3,electrocardiogram qt prolonged,"Frankly, without stimulant medication in some form, I can't keep myself to an exercise routine and end up with much worse blood pressure, higher heart rate, etc. So while chemically it might directly correlate to higher bp/hr in the short term, long-term the emergent property of more aerobic exercise makes it healthier for me, and I'm diagnosed with hypertension."
