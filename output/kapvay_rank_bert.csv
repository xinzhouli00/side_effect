top 1,abnormal behaviour,"""I started my son on this medicine on Friday. He is doing well. No emotional breakdowns, no crying. The only issue I am having is he is falling asleep around noon every day. He hasn't had a nap since he was 16 months old. He is 7, going on 8. I can't imagine his teacher will be all that amused when he goes to sleep during class tomorrow."""
top 1,abnormal behaviour,"""My 6-year-old tried this after Intuniv failed. It made him constantly tired and irritable, and actually made his impulsiveness worse since he just seemed cranky and emotional all of the time. It also constipated him to the point that he ended up with fissures. It never made a meaningful dent in his ability to concentrate or sit still, and he became more argumentative in school and less willing to comply. I've yet to meet anyone that these work for, but it sure would be nice if there were a non-stimulant that worked. We're on stimulants now and still haven't found a miracle there, either. I will say that it didn't affect his appetite, which was nice."""
top 1,abnormal behaviour,"""My 6-year-old son was diagnosed with ADHD last year. I saw signs during the preschool years as he was kicked out of three schools. This has been a trying year as we started him on Concerta, Focalin 2.5, and Focalin ER. Intuniv: Although the stimulants were great and we saw the benefits, it was difficult for me to see the negative side effects (tics and meltdown). I had mentioned to my doctor a month ago about Clonidine to reduce side effects of stimulants. She declined as she was uncomfortable with providing adult medication to children. However, she contacted me about Kapvay, which has been wonderful. Day 6 and a bit sleepy, unlike Intuniv (sedated). I will keep you up to date."""
top 1,abnormal behaviour,"""We have an 8-year-old who we adopted from foster care last year. He was diagnosed with ADHD soon after. He was put on Concerta. We saw definite improvement. But early this year, he started exhibiting increased symptoms of ADHD. He could not fall asleep until late, so we used Melatonin. His doctor started him on Kapvay about 5 weeks ago. We started seeing a great improvement the first week because he fell asleep without Melatonin and started getting 10 hours of sleep. The second week, we added the morning dose. Mornings immediately became incredible. We no longer needed checklists for him. The teacher said he still needed better focus, so he is now on 0.3mg. He is doing incredibly well. His doctor is going to wean him down on Concerta."""

My son took it for the first time last night before bed. He went right to sleep, and when he woke up this morning, he was the calmest, most pleasant, helpful, and nicest he had ever been in his life. I could not believe the overnight change. I'm so glad it worked so fast. He has not gotten in trouble once today, which is a new record! His teachers are going to be thrilled on Monday!

tail 2,no adverse event,"""My son has used various stimulants for 5 yrs.  Still struggling because of impulsivity & super high metabolism, the docs wanted to add non-stimulants.  We started w/ Intuiv, which dropped his bp way too low (75/43) so stopped after 2 wks.  Tried Clonidine IR and it worked GREAT the 1st 2 days, then fine (not great, just fine).  The doc changed to Kapvay for long-acting effects, but we stopped after 2 wks because he got awful insomnia (took 2-3 hrs to fall asleep instead of his usual 15 mins).  Last night we went back to Clonidine IR - he fell asleep quickly and slept great!  I give Kapvay a 2 because it decreased his impulsivity a bit, but the insomnia was awful, he got more aggressive/emotional, and really affected him negatively."""
