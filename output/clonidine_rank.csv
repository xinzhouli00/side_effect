top 1,irritability,"I was diagnosed with bipolar and narcolepsy before I was correctly diagnosed with ADHD (which more accurately matched the symptoms they called bipolar) and autism (turns out if I avoid sensory overstimulation I don't have autistic shutdowns, aka the naps I would have to take during the day that they thought were narcolepsy despite having difficulty sleeping)."

To answer your question, Wellbutrin doesn't affect serotonin.  It's an NDRI. Wellbutrin and Zoloft are commonly prescribed together"

top 1,irritability,I fall asleep easily but toss and turn all night. Fall back asleep fine but in pain because of the positions I get into. I feel that “driven by a motor” impulse to turn over.
top 1,irritability,Also known as Vistaril. I was given this for crippling anxiety a few years ago. I could not tolerate benzos so this is what worked for me. It is an antihistamine.

top 2,dizziness,"Just here to say certain co-morbidities make ADHD stimulants a terrible idea.  Most common presentation of this is making the symptoms of the non-ADHD disorder worse, even dangerous.

Good luck!"
top 2,dizziness,Please consider Non24 disorder. It's quite common for ADHD / ASD to have Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder or even Non24. That's totally fine! You simply should restructure your life according to your biorhythm / genetic fixed needs.

top 5,hypotension,"too little sleep can increase insulin resistance. additionally, it also results in a significant loss of the benefits of insulin. too little sleep can have a negative impact on lipid levels. also a regular lack of sleep can lead to high blood pressure (hypertension"

tail 1,no adverse event,I either fall immediately into a coma or I lay in the darkness tossing and turning... pondering every mistake I have EVER made.. every awkward encounter.  there is no middle ground.

tail 1,no adverse event,"Hey. Just saw this post. I've been wanting to read about others experiences with Clonidine.

Just making sure you're OK. Did you end up going to hospital? Chest pain especially in the areas you described aren't ever something you should ignore.

This medication effects blood pressure so stopping cold turkey can be dangerous.

Stay safe please!"

When I started taking it I would drop dead for 12 hours. Two months later, I became largely tolerant. Antipsychotics are definitely not a long-term solution."
