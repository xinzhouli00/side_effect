tail 2,condition aggravated,"Your ADHD symptoms may not be caused by low norepinephrine, it’s not been found conclusively in everyone with ADHD.

I’ve been on Qelbree 200 mg for a month and it’s made a hell of a subtle difference, everything feels more in control and I’m less of a victim of my inattentiveness. I even remember to start the dryer after cleaning the lint trap (big win). Stimulants will always pack a bigger punch than Qelbree or Strattera though."
