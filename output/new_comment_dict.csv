2,concerta,"""Having suffered with depression and ADHD as an adult, honestly this medication is a godsend. I'm only on 18mg (Extended release) and take it with Wellbutrin (for the depression) and I must say it's a life changer! The extended release makes a big difference - blood levels are more stable. No more emotional moods, no more crying, no more feeling like dying, no more negative thoughts. Also, you can concentrate for long periods of time and not get frustrated and be very clear-minded. I can study for 6 hours straight! After trying so many medications, this just works. Side effects: Fast heartbeat, lots of energy, and maybe a libido boost. Really good for adult ADHD and depression. Please note. Everyone is different. You might have a different experience.""",having suffered with depression and adhd as an adult honestly this medication is a godsend im only on mg extended release and take it with wellbutrin for the depression and i must say its a life changer the extended release makes a big difference blood levels are more stable no more emotional moods no more crying no more feeling like dying no more negative thoughts also you can concentrate for long periods of time and not get frustrated and be very clear minded i can study for hours straight after trying so many medications this just works side effects fast heartbeat lots of energy and maybe a libido boost really good for adult adhd and depression please note everyone is different you might have a different experience,[]

After a month, I was sleeping in the woods, homeless, driving a Mercedes Benz, when I realized something was wrong! I am on meds for the second day now, and after an hour, I could feel myself becoming emotionally and mentally comfortable. I couldn’t stop running for an outside solution to an inside problem. I could not focus, could not engage at work, so I didn’t work, therefore, everything started to crash down around me. I almost lost everything I had and loved. ADHD for me is here to stay!

11,concerta,"""Since starting on Concerta, I have been able to effectively get my life together. I am no longer impulsive, hyper, inattentive, or anxious. The last two years have been the best I've ever experienced. I struggled with procrastination and mood issues prior to being medicated for ADHD. Past inaccurate diagnosis caused doctors to label my ADHD-I with a number of false mental health issues. The wrong medications caused a lot of damage in my personal life. Now, I have finally been able to get my life together.

15,concerta,"""Ok, this is where I am after two weeks. I'm turning 54 one of these days, Managing Director of my company, and self-diagnosed with ADHD about a month ago. I matched ALL the criteria. Went to see a doctor and he confirmed my suspicions. I relayed my struggles with studies at University and he referred to me attaining two degrees as a 'miracle.' I cannot begin to explain how difficult studying was, not to mention having to sit through hours of lectures. There was no - and I stress - NO filter between my brain, mind, and my mouth. Anger, profanity, and impulse behavior was only curbed by my life-long ability to fall asleep anywhere, anytime. Imagine an alien being in charge for 53 years. It's all gone.

24,concerta,"""I am in my early thirties and very recently started drug trials for ADHD. After trying Vyvanse, which didn't work out, I moved to Concerta. On the lowest dose, I had concerns, as it seemed to make my ADHD symptoms worse. I became more irritable and more distracted. After a week, I moved the dose up to the next level and had a terrible day. Extremely irritable, so lethargic I could do almost nothing all day, difficult time sleeping... I had difficulty dealing with my children if they did the slightest thing wrong.

25,concerta,"""For most of my life, I have drifted in and out of employment. Being told I am a daydreamer and missing out on things most people would spot a mile off (dates, small details on forms, cleaning, rota, etc.). A few months after starting this medication, I also started a job! In immigration, so a lot of paperwork, extensive training, long shifts, and difficult customers. Almost a month in, and I’m getting appraisals, 100% on most of my work, always on time, and never miss a beat! I am 30 years old, and I could cry. This has literally changed my life. In the first week, you will experience jaw clenching, etc., but it settles. I am taking two tablets of 18 mg a day. Sorry to those that have experienced bad side effects, it’s trial and error, and maybe your chemistry does not align with the medicine, but that’s okay-keep trying!""",for most of my life i have drifted in and out of employment being told i am a daydreamer and missing out on things most people would spot a mile off dates small details on forms cleaning rota etc a few months after starting this medication i also started a job in immigration so a lot of paperwork extensive training long shifts and difficult customers almost a month in and im getting appraisals on most of my work always on time and never miss a beat i am years old and i could cry this has literally changed my life in the first week you will experience jaw clenching etc but it settles i am taking two tablets of mg a day sorry to those that have experienced bad side effects its trial and error and maybe your chemistry does not align with the medicine but thats okay keep trying,[]
26,concerta,"""I grew up with severe panic attacks. When I was 19, up until the age of 27, I stayed in my room. I couldn't leave my house. I had/have severe anxiety and depression. Years went by and I lost hope. I didn't have a job, I was a loser. I took a mindfulness class and after each mindfulness tape, I noticed I was in extreme pain, more so than the other people sitting around me. It was then that I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. I was prescribed Adderall and Vyvanse for my ADHD but they made me extremely tired. Currently, I am on Cymbalta, Concerta, and Remeron. With this combination, I began a full-time job. I have been employed for 7 months, and I would be lost without Concerta. If you're looking for a drug that is similar to Wellbutrin, Concerta is the answer. Do not give up hope. Never give up hope. Don't take 'no' for an answer, and if a doctor is diagnosing you incorrectly, leave and find a different doctor. There is a right combination of medication out there for you.

27,concerta,"""When I was about 13, the school psychologist who I was seeing for behavior problems suggested to my mother that I start taking Ritalin. I was hyperactive, could not focus, blurted things out, and was generally viewed as a weirdo by my peers. My mother refused to follow the psychologist's advice because she 'didn't want me on medicines'. The same diagnosis and suggested treatment followed the next year and the year after by the psychiatrist who I was referred to. Eventually, I dropped out of school, somehow managed to get my GED, and enroll in college. I decided a few years ago to see a doctor and he prescribed Concerta. I am now able to follow through on projects and not feel like a failure, frustrated all the time. It has really worked for me.""",when i was about the school psychologist who i was seeing for behavior problems suggested to my mother that i start taking ritalin i was hyperactive could not focus blurted things out and was generally viewed as a weirdo by my peers my mother refused to follow the psychologists advice because she didnt want me on medicines the same diagnosis and suggested treatment followed the next year and the year after by the psychiatrist who i was referred to eventually i dropped out of school somehow managed to get my ged and enroll in college i decided a few years ago to see a doctor and he prescribed concerta i am now able to follow through on projects and not feel like a failure frustrated all the time it has really worked for me,[]

I started with 18 mg but didn't feel any difference. It only decreased my appetite (I lost about 5 lbs a week) to the point where I became underweight. My doctor recently upped my dose to 36 mg, and I feel worse than before. I've been having a hard time falling asleep and have slept very restlessly. I am still losing weight. I've also noticed that I feel more moody and impulsive, and I have been hyper-fixating more and lashing out at my family.

35,concerta,"""I've struggled with ADHD and depression for about half my life. I started this medication around 3 months ago. I take the 54 mg dose. I've tried probably every antidepressant there is, and quite a few for anxiety. But this, I think personally, Concerta has helped quite a bit in regard to both. Because of it, I've been able to wean off my antidepressant and no longer have to take it. The appetite suppressant does help me out since I'm working on weight loss, but it can also be a struggle to eat at times or find a food that is appetizing in general because of it. And the medication can cause constipation and dry mouth, which is inconvenient. Overall, I think it's helped me a lot in focusing on coursework and its intended purpose.""",ive struggled with adhd and depression for about half my life i started this medication around months ago i take the mg dose ive tried probably every antidepressant there is and quite a few for anxiety but this i think personally concerta has helped quite a bit in regard to both because of it ive been able to wean off my antidepressant and no longer have to take it the appetite suppressant does help me out since im working on weight loss but it can also be a struggle to eat at times or find a food that is appetizing in general because of it and the medication can cause constipation and dry mouth which is inconvenient overall i think its helped me a lot in focusing on coursework and its intended purpose,[]
36,concerta,"""Before Concerta I was labeled disruptive; unintelligent, impulsive, poor concentration etc. The worst part was that no matter how hard I tried, I always messed up, and it was never on purpose. I am often described as having 'no-filter' between my head and mouth. Now, with Concerta, I am able to 'filter' information correctly. I have control with what I say, and I can concentrate when I need to. This is, however, no miracle - I have bad days. Like anyone, my cognition suffers if I haven't had enough sleep, etc. Concerta only gives one control of their actions and organizes things in your head a bit better - something I had been long without.

38,concerta,"""My experience with Concerta has been amazing. I am 12 and this has helped me deal with bullying, anger issues, and lack of focus. I have learned that just because you are ADHD does not mean you can't have a normal life.

43,concerta,"""I have been taking this for 10 years (started at 18 mg, went up to 36 mg). Recently (several months ago), I developed several horrible side effects. For example, it made me feel nervous. I could not keep still. It also made me extra irritable (to the point I was yelling at my friends for the littlest things). I also felt depressed (to the point I did not want to get out of bed at all) and could not sleep. The doctor brought me down to 18 mg, symptoms did not improve. I immediately stopped taking this and felt 100% better the next day. The doctor put me on Adderall XR, which works a lot better with very little side effects.

Concerta has been nothing short of a miracle for her. She finally ended up on the 54mg dosage and does very well. The only side effect she has had is loss of appetite which she now knows to eat a healthy/big breakfast before her medication in the morning. She then eats a normal dinner. She has occasionally had insomnia if she takes her medication later in the morning or if she has accidentally had caffeine. Overall, she is in a good groove with this medication and her SAT score went from 1600 to 2000 after medication and a prep course; GPA from 3.3 to 3.9.""",my daughter was finally diagnosed with adhd inattentive type at age after a lot of stress regarding high school academics and feeling dumb concerta has been nothing short of a miracle for her she finally ended up on the mg dosage and does very well the only side effect she has had is loss of appetite which she now knows to eat a healthybig breakfast before her medication in the morning she then eats a normal dinner she has occasionally had insomnia if she takes her medication later in the morning or if she has accidentally had caffeine overall she is in a good groove with this medication and her sat score went from to after medication and a prep course gpa from to,['drug ineffective']
48,concerta,"""I've been on Concerta since I was about 13 (I'm 22 now). When I first started the medication, I experienced a fair amount of weight loss. Overall, Concerta has truly changed my life and made me a more focused student. Since I've been on it for so long, I have learned to manage side effects but some that have been ongoing are: upset stomach right after taking the medication (due to the stimulant effects and lack of food), slight headaches, jitters, binging when the medication wears off, and occasional paranoia. When first beginning the medication, remember to force yourself to have some caloric intake even if it is just a smoothie.

Positives: my grades and work ethic excelled, accomplished a lot, confidence raised. But, it may have just been me, but after being on Concerta, I became very antisocial (the complete opposite of myself) and basically got lost in my head. I also suffer from depression and severe seasonal affective disorder, and my first winter taking the Concerta was a horrible experience.

59,concerta,"""My daughter was diagnosed with ADHD in the 2nd grade, and her doctor and I discussed different medications and settled on Concerta. Grades were never a problem, but behavior and socialization were. She hated the medication and would spit it out or hide it. It gave her headaches, loss of appetite, and sleep loss. Eventually, she began taking it regularly and began to do well in school. The behavior problems ceased, as well as socialization. She took this medication for about 2 years, and then I decided to pull her off.

This turned me off to stimulants for a while. Finally, I started seeing a new doctor, and he prescribed me Concerta XL for my long days at work, and it has definitely changed my life. At first, it was for my ADHD, but it also helps with my depression. It makes me feel awake but not jittery and anxious. I feel more social and talkative (I'm very shy, and people always make comments on how I don't talk that much). I don't have as many bad days like I was having before. I still get them, but they seem to be more mild and less often. There is a slight come-down period when it is wearing off, and you can get a little bummed during this time.

When I stopped taking this medication, I was unable to pay attention in class and kept misplacing flash drives and pencils.
