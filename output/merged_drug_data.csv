It made him constantly tired and irritable, and actually made his impulsiveness worse since he just seemed cranky and emotional all of the time.

It never made a meaningful dent in his ability to concentrate or sit still, and he became more argumentative in school and less willing to comply. I've yet to meet anyone that these work for, but it sure would be nice if there were a non-stimulant that worked. We're on stimulants now and still haven't found a miracle there, either.

The following study helps explain why a person with ADHD new to Adderall might not feel any effect and a person who has no cognitive issue might have an overwhelming effect. 

In the link below, blood serum pH (acidity or basicness) and the lower the pH the weaker the effect. This is why Tums potentiates Adderall, but if you raised the pH of the entire body the same dose might be hell and cause unpleasant things like tachycardia.
