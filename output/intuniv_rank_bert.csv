top 1,abnormal behaviour,"""Intuniv worked terribly for me. I was prescribed it for ADHD, and it caused so many issues and fixed absolutely none.

top 1,abnormal behaviour,"""I would like to share my experience with Intuniv for those specifically with comorbid ADHD/Bipolar. It initially improved working memory (easier to take time to perform tasks such as not jumping ahead while reading), then, as it works on 2A receptors, created a DECREASED DESIRE to perform the tasks. Essentially, it lowers NE. So, lower motivation, which nearly completely negates the easier task performance. THIS IS A COMMON THREAD. Therefore, works better in conjunction with stims. It also created depersonalization. Finally, it caused a unique mixed episode with grandiosity and irritability, but psychomotor retardation and grumpiness. Think increased prefrontal, decreased limbic. Bipolars BEWARE. We are different than strict ADHD cases."""
top 1,abnormal behaviour,"""Male adult ADHD, mostly inattentive (but restless on the inside!), also bipolar type 2. I was on Ritalin for about a year and had a lot of problems with a dry and stuffy nose with frequent infections. Atomoxetine had similar effects: sleepy, nasal stuffiness, premature ejaculation (only ejaculation was premature). Intuniv actually reversed nasal dryness, my nose never felt better. Intuniv has both stimulating and calming effects, and my mood generally is better. I have more frequent urination at night, I often have to get up at 5 a.m. to go to the bathroom. Sometimes it is hard to get back to sleep, but then usually instant-release Clonidine helps (Clonidine has helped for problems with insomnia). I have NOT had any problems with sexual side effects on Intuniv, which is great. Perhaps only a slight increase in libido, but it could be due to improvement in mood as well. Appetite is normal, it has helped me lose a little weight. Ritalin used to give me increased hunger and sugar cravings."""

The primary reason I started Intuniv was because I was having issues with jitters and anxiety on the Vyvanse. It was frustrating, because I absolutely had moments where I felt great and had brilliant focus, but I would sometimes get stuck in these rumination loops, anxieties, etc. CBT therapy helped a little, but I saw Dr. Russell Barkley talk about how Intuniv can be taken WITH a stimulant to help with emotional control, so I asked my psychiatrist about it, and he knew all about Intuniv. I eventually settled on 4mg/day. I am WAY more 'chill' these days, yet still very much me. I just feel more level headed.
