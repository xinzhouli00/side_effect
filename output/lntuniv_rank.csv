This ^ should be the official term. Wouldn't surprise me people on this thread will use it in the future. No more direct stigma."
top 1,irritability,"Any sexual side-effects? I’m currently on adderall and would like to try this as an add-on for ameliorating elevated blood pressure & anxiety, but I’m worried the A2 agonism would mess with erection quality. Have you (or anyone else who happens upon this question) experienced anything like that from the guanfacine?"
top 1,irritability,"Be very cautious with guanfacine, it is a med originally meant to influence your cardiovascular system after all. It gave me super slow heartbeat and VERY low blood pressure in higher doses and started to negatively affect the effectiveness of Vyvanse too."

top 3,dyspnoea,"I have a double met COMT mutation which means I am a poor processor of norepinephrine. Hence the hitters and hard crashes I've been getting. Guanfacine antagonize the alpha a2 receptor which drops the norepinephrine in your system hence its effect lowering blood pressure, calming the sympathetic nervous system, and reducing anxiety."
