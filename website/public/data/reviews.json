This is why Tums potentiates Adderall, but if you raised the pH of the entire body the same dose might be hell and cause unpleasant things like tachycardia. \n\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/340081430_Mechanistic_PBPK_Modeling_of_Urine_pH_Effect_on_Renal_and_Systemic_Disposition_of_Methamphetamine_and_Amphetamine#pf7"
