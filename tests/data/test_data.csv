concerta,"""Having suffered with depression and ADHD as an adult, honestly this medication is a godsend. I'm only on 18mg (Extended release) and take it with Wellbutrin (for the depression) and I must say it's a life changer! The extended release makes a big difference - blood levels are more stable. No more emotional moods, no more crying, no more feeling like dying, no more negative thoughts. Also, you can concentrate for long periods of time and not get frustrated and be very clear-minded. I can study for 6 hours straight! After trying so many medications, this just works. Side effects: Fast heartbeat, lots of energy, and maybe a libido boost. Really good for adult ADHD and depression. Please note. Everyone is different. You might have a different experience.""",having suffered with depression and adhd as an adult honestly this medication is a godsend im only on mg extended release and take it with wellbutrin for the depression and i must say its a life changer the extended release makes a big difference blood levels are more stable no more emotional moods no more crying no more feeling like dying no more negative thoughts also you can concentrate for long periods of time and not get frustrated and be very clear minded i can study for hours straight after trying so many medications this just works side effects fast heartbeat lots of energy and maybe a libido boost really good for adult adhd and depression please note everyone is different you might have a different experience
concerta,"""I am 54, been taking methylphenidate (Ritalin first, then Concerta) for 14 years. I decided to come off cold turkey to see if the doctor made a misdiagnosis, lol. After a month, I was sleeping in the woods, homeless, driving a Mercedes Benz, when I realized something was wrong! I am on meds for the second day now, and after an hour, I could feel myself becoming emotionally and mentally comfortable. I couldn’t stop running for an outside solution to an inside problem. I could not focus, could not engage at work, so I didn’t work, therefore, everything started to crash down around me. I almost lost everything I had and loved. ADHD for me is here to stay! I will end with this: I have no chance at a normal life without the help of medication!""",i am been taking methylphenidate ritalin first then concerta for years i decided to come off cold turkey to see if the doctor made a misdiagnosis lol after a month i was sleeping in the woods homeless driving a mercedes benz when i realized something was wrong i am on meds for the second day now and after an hour i could feel myself becoming emotionally and mentally comfortable i couldnt stop running for an outside solution to an inside problem i could not focus could not engage at work so i didnt work therefore everything started to crash down around me i almost lost everything i had and loved adhd for me is here to stay i will end with this i have no chance at a normal life without the help of medication

ritalin,"""I've always known that I battled with either ADD or ADHD since childhood. I never bothered to get formally diagnosed, but if left untreated, it results in severe anxiety and depression. Due to this, I lost my job and realized that it was affecting the quality of life. I got assessed and diagnosed at the age of 43 with Adult ADHD - severe. I was really scared to take the Ritalin because of the bad reputation it has, but the difference was immediate. I feel calm, at peace, no more anxiety, can focus. It is life-changing. Side effects minimum. I think this med is demonized unnecessarily. I have my life back.""",ive always known that i battled with either add or adhd since childhood i never bothered to get formally diagnosed but if left untreated it results in severe anxiety and depression due to this i lost my job and realized that it was affecting the quality of life i got assessed and diagnosed at the age of with adult adhd severe i was really scared to take the ritalin because of the bad reputation it has but the difference was immediate i feel calm at peace no more anxiety can focus it is life changing side effects minimum i think this med is demonized unnecessarily i have my life back
ritalin,"""35-year-old adult male, undiagnosed ADD my whole life, depression, and anxiety as well. This drug has completely turned me around. 20mg in the morning, 10mg in the afternoon. When on it, I don't feel high, just alive. I'm awake, alert, focused, and most importantly, out of my shell. I don't dread work, I welcome it, I hunger for tasks. I almost immediately go from insecure introvert to confident extrovert. Unfortunately, it's very difficult to function now without it. I refuse to abuse it, so I am very strict with my 30mg per day. When it wears off, I completely revert back to my old self.""",year old adult male undiagnosed add my whole life depression and anxiety as well this drug has completely turned me around mg in the morning mg in the afternoon when on it i dont feel high just alive im awake alert focused and most importantly out of my shell i dont dread work i welcome it i hunger for tasks i almost immediately go from insecure introvert to confident extrovert unfortunately its very difficult to function now without it i refuse to abuse it so i am very strict with my mg per day when it wears off i completely revert back to my old self

adderall,"""Been taking Adderall and generics for 25 years. I just spent a year on the ALV manufacturer of amphetamine with dextroamphetamine and everything took a nosedive. GPA went down, personal life, and just general capacity for life. Ended up with some acute OCD due to some other factors. Switched back to TEVA and I'm instantly clearer. Whatever FDA regulations they have controlling this product are either wrong or being ignored. There is a difference between what is supposed to be and what is sometimes, and this is one of those times. I take 30mg twice a day. I always wake up an hour early and take it, then go back to sleep so I wake up naturally. With ALV it would be 4 hours later instead of 45 minutes later. I went from a 4.0 GPA in 300 and 400 level classes to barely passing a 100 Level survey course. If it wasn't for the recent shortage and having to switch pharmacies, I would still be on ALV's trash pills.""",been taking adderall and generics for years i just spent a year on the alv manufacturer of amphetamine with dextroamphetamine and everything took a nosedive gpa went down personal life and just general capacity for life ended up with some acute ocd due to some other factors switched back to teva and im instantly clearer whatever fda regulations they have controlling this product are either wrong or being ignored there is a difference between what is supposed to be and what is sometimes and this is one of those times i take mg twice a day i always wake up an hour early and take it then go back to sleep so i wake up naturally with alv it would be hours later instead of minutes later i went from a gpa in and level classes to barely passing a level survey course if it wasnt for the recent shortage and having to switch pharmacies i would still be on alvs trash pills

dexedrine,"""Teva's 5/10 mg Dexedrine tablets appear tainted and/or lack the correct active ingredient. It doesn't control symptoms and makes me feel miserable, hostile, and angry. I've been taking Dexedrine for years, allowing me to function well except for the Teva brand. All generics are not the same. I had the same problem with Teva Dexedrine a few years ago and switched pharmacies. Other generic Dexedrines worked for another 3 years. This month, it was again not working, making me feel miserable and not controlling symptoms. The manufacturer was not on the bottle, so I called the pharmacy. Yup, Teva! I've had more than 36 bottles of Dexedrine since the previous negative experience; none were Teva and all worked. Out of 36 vials, one did not work and made me feel miserable, and the only one was Teva. The odds (0.028) are too long for coincidence or expectancy effect.

dexstrostat,"""I was a horrible student all through high school. I was convinced I was stupid. I became the class clown to hide my shame. That was fifty years ago. Now, at seventy, I look back on the career I forged as a successful television writer, knowing I couldn’t have done it without Dexedrine. For me, it was magical—smooth and non-addicting. Yes, it can get the ticker beating more rapidly at times. Because of this and heart disease in my family, my cardiologist suggested I stop. I did, and I have not been as productive since. Stopping the medication after having taken it daily for over twenty-five years was simple. No withdrawal. Zero. I slept a little more initially. That is all. True ADD is a tragedy. It robs people of their potential, leaving them shadows of what they could be. Don’t give up on yourself. If you really do suffer from it—and I mean suffer—find a doctor who specializes in ADD, get tested, and get on this medication. A calmer, more productive you awaits.""",i was a horrible student all through high school i was convinced i was stupid i became the class clown to hide my shame that was fifty years ago now at seventy i look back on the career i forged as a successful television writer knowing i couldnt have done it without dexedrine for me it was magicalsmooth and non addicting yes it can get the ticker beating more rapidly at times because of this and heart disease in my family my cardiologist suggested i stop i did and i have not been as productive since stopping the medication after having taken it daily for over twenty five years was simple no withdrawal zero i slept a little more initially that is all true add is a tragedy it robs people of their potential leaving them shadows of what they could be dont give up on yourself if you really do suffer from itand i mean sufferfind a doctor who specializes in add get tested and get on this medication a calmer more productive you awaits

vyvanse,"""I take Vyvanse for ADHD and Binge Eating Disorder. I began taking 50 mg Vyvanse in August 2016, and currently take the same amount. Over a span of about 2 years, I lost 70 pounds and got into the best shape of my life. I had great eating habits. I was sociable and doing great. I got everything done in a timely manner. All of a sudden, it stopped working 2.5 years after I started taking it. I gained over 30 lbs in about 3.5 months. All my hard work just disappeared. I don’t know what happened, but it is devastating. I am so tired all the time, have no drive to do anything, binge eat every day, and I’m angry and irritable. It’s been like this for months. I’m a shell of myself. I suggest it for short-term use but not long-term.

strattera,"""I am a 28-year-old female with the inattentive type ADHD. For a long time, I was on 30mg of Adderall, and to say the least, it ruined my life. After 5 years of being on that crappy drug, I wanted to try a non-stimulant. My doctor prescribed me 40mg of Strattera. At first, the side effects were terrible. My mood swings were terrible, I felt dizzy, sleepy, constipated, and had a loss of interest in sex. The side effects only lasted around 2 weeks... then came the good part. All these side effects subsided, and I noticed how calm I was. Usually, I'm on edge. I also noticed that I'm more attentive to the things I need to take care of at home and work. I enjoy sex more than I did before, and I'm sure this med has helped me become closer with my fiance again. If you are suffering from ADHD and don't like stimulants, please give this med a chance. It is well worth it!""",i am a year old female with the inattentive type adhd for a long time i was on mg of adderall and to say the least it ruined my life after years of being on that crappy drug i wanted to try a non stimulant my doctor prescribed me mg of strattera at first the side effects were terrible my mood swings were terrible i felt dizzy sleepy constipated and had a loss of interest in sex the side effects only lasted around weeks then came the good part all these side effects subsided and i noticed how calm i was usually im on edge i also noticed that im more attentive to the things i need to take care of at home and work i enjoy sex more than i did before and im sure this med has helped me become closer with my fiance again if you are suffering from adhd and dont like stimulants please give this med a chance it is well worth it
strattera,"""At 32 years old, I was diagnosed with ADHD, which was a huge relief. I had always known that I felt different, and my behavior throughout childhood was questionable. It's sad to think that ADHD was never a recognized condition for girls back then. If it had been, I believe my childhood would have been very different. Strattera has changed my life. All the noise in my head, impulsiveness, procrastination, and extreme exhaustion have stopped. I no longer dread the days ahead or count down the minutes until bedtime. I am truly enjoying life. This drug is not a miracle, but when combined with positive steps, it has made me realize that I am equal. I no longer feel like an imposter or am terrified of social situations. The initial side effects I experienced were fatigue, nausea, and loss of appetite. However, for me, these side effects were preferable to continuing down a path of self-destruction and the inability to exercise self-control. If you are starting this drug, stay strong and have faith.""",at years old i was diagnosed with adhd which was a huge relief i had always known that i felt different and my behavior throughout childhood was questionable its sad to think that adhd was never a recognized condition for girls back then if it had been i believe my childhood would have been very different strattera has changed my life all the noise in my head impulsiveness procrastination and extreme exhaustion have stopped i no longer dread the days ahead or count down the minutes until bedtime i am truly enjoying life this drug is not a miracle but when combined with positive steps it has made me realize that i am equal i no longer feel like an imposter or am terrified of social situations the initial side effects i experienced were fatigue nausea and loss of appetite however for me these side effects were preferable to continuing down a path of self destruction and the inability to exercise self control if you are starting this drug stay strong and have faith

kapvay,"""Depression for fifteen months hinged on the fact that my inattention was so bad. Every day it was constantly 'OH MY GOD, CAN'T DO ANYTHING.' I had so many motivations and ambitions for projects and was so overwhelmed by ADHD that I could not do any of it. All I can say is that I am really disappointed with Strattera... I fought and fought to get a stimulant to no avail, and they finally gave me Kapvay for bedtime. It's been two weeks, and my depression has finally lifted because my inattention and distraction are gone. They are symbiotic with each other. And now I can DO STUFF and not have to binge-watch Impractical Jokers anymore.

wellbutrin,"For Depression""I had an odd situation where I was not really depressed with sadness but I just felt nothing. I never got angry, never got happy - never wanted to do anything besides lay in bed. I tried to fake it as much as possible but I couldn’t anymore. I stopped answering my phone, lost all interest and motivation. I had taken all the antidepressants on the market but they made me feel crazy. My hands shook and I felt out of my body. I started researching the symptoms of low dopamine and I had almost all of the symptoms - poor memory, poor concentration, excessive worrying, lack of motivation - and overall just not giving a $#|+ about anything. I asked my doctor for Wellbutrin. In a couple of days I was calling old friends, kicking butt at work, and motivated for life again. My problem all along was dopamine not serotonin.
